'''Attorney's fee''' is a chiefly [[United States]] term for compensation for legal services performed by an [[Lawyer|attorney]] ([[lawyer]] or [[law firm]]) for a client, in or out of court. It may be an hourly, flat-rate or contingent fee. Recent studies suggest that when lawyers charge a flat-fee rather than billing by the hour, they work less hard on behalf of clients and client get worse outcomes.&lt;ref name="Brian Leiter's Law School Reports"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://leiterlawschool.typepad.com/leiter/2016/05/do-clients-lose-when-lawyers-work-for-a-fixed-fee-michael-simkovic.html|title=Brian Leiter's Law School Reports|website=leiterlawschool.typepad.com|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwall"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwall|first=Benjamin|date=2015-06-25|title=High-Powered Attorney Incentives: A Look at the New Indigent Defense System in South Carolina|ssrn=2623202|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amanda Y. Agan"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/amandayagan/research|title=Research |author= Amanda Y. Agan|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attorney fees are separate from fines, compensatory and [[punitive damages]], and (except in [[Nevada]]) from [[court costs]] in a legal case. Under the "[[American rule (attorney's fees)|American rule]]", attorney fees are usually not paid by the losing party to the winning party in a case, except pursuant to specific [[Statute|statutory]] or [[contract]]ual rights.

==Overview==
The phrase is a legal [[term of art]] in American jurisprudence (in which lawyers are collectively referred to as "attorneys", a wording practice not found in most other legal systems). '''Attorney's fees''' (or '''attorneys' fees''', depending upon number of attorneys involved, or simplified to '''attorney fees''') are the fees, including labor charges and costs, charged by lawyers or their firms for legal services provided by them to their clients.  They do not include incidental, non-legal costs (e.g., expedited shipping costs for legal documents). Generally ([[Nevada]] being an exception), attorney fees are tabulated separately from [[court costs]], and are also separate from fines, compensatory and punitive damages, and other monies in a legal case not enumerated as court costs.

The analogous concept has differing names and applicability in [[common law]] systems such as in most of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems such as those of most of Europe and many former European colonies.  For example, in a court case under [[English law]], the fees of [[solicitors]] and [[barristers]] (two types of lawyer) are combined with court costs and various other expenses into a combined "[[Costs (English law)|costs]]", while non-court solicitor expenses may be separately billed as per-hour charges and those of barristers as daily brief fees. The losing party in a case in most common law systems pays for the costs (including fees) of both parties.

[[State law]]s or [[bar association]] regulations, many of which are based on Rule 1.5 of the [[American Bar Association]]'s ''[[Rules of Professional Conduct]]'', govern the terms under which lawyers can accept fees.&lt;ref name="1.5"&gt;Cornell Law School web site, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/ethics/aba/current/ABA_CODE.HTM#Rule_1.5 ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct (2004), Rule 1.5: Fees]&lt;/ref&gt; Many complaints to ethics boards regarding attorneys revolve around excessive attorney's fees.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Chin &amp; Scott Wells, ''Can a Reasonable Doubt have an Unreasonable Price? Limitations on Attorney's Fees in Criminal Cases,'' [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224273&amp;high=%20Gabriel%20CHin 41 ''Boston College Law Review'' 1 (1999)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some American [[jurisdiction]]s, a lawyer for the [[plaintiff]] in a [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] case can take a case on a contingent fee basis. A contingent fee is a percentage of the monetary [[Legal judgment|judgment]] or settlement. The contingent fee may be split among several firms who have contractual arrangements amongst themselves for referrals or other assistance.  Where a plaintiff loses, the attorney may not receive any money for his or her work. In practice, historically [[tort]] cases involving [[personal injury]] often involve contingent fees, with attorneys being paid a portion of the [[pain and suffering]] damages; one commentator says a typical split of pain and suffering is one-third for the lawyer, one-third for the physician, and one-third for the plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell. (1981). [http://www.law.virginia.edu/pdf/faculty/hein/o%27connell/1981u_ill_l_rev333_1981.pdf "A Proposal to Abolish Defendants' payment for Pain and Suffering in Return for Payment of Claimants' attorneys' fees"]. ''University of Illinois Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contingent fee has been described as the ‘poor man’s key to the courthouse".&lt;ref&gt;American Bar Association ;   “Providing Keys to the Courthouse Without Giving Up Full Recovery” by Nicole Liguori Micklich, in ''Construct!'', Volume 2, No. 15, Winter 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas, corporations or wealthy individuals can afford to hire attorneys to pursue their legal interests, the contingency fee affords any injury victim the opportunity, regardless of ability to pay, to hire the best attorney in his or her field. Most jurisdictions in the United States prohibit working for a contingent fee in [[family law]] or criminal cases.

In the United States, an up-front fee paid to a lawyer is called a [[Retainer agreement|retainer]]. Money within the retainer is often used to "buy" a certain amount of work.  Some contracts provide that when the money from the retainer is gone, the fee is renegotiated. This is to be differentiated between a retainer in Commonwealth states, where a retainer is the contract that is initially signed by a client to engage a lawyer. Money may or may not be paid upfront, but the lawyer is still "retained".

==Amount of fees==
Attorney fees are negotiated between the attorney and client, subject to any limits imposed by state law and the general principle that an attorney fee must be reasonable. Although fee agreements in most cases can be oral agreements, it is good practice for lawyers to enter formal written fee agreements with their clients, and to clearly describe how fees are calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carr|first1=David C.|title=Attorney Fees: Five Keys to Ethical Compliance|journal=GPSolo|date=October 2010|url=https://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/gp_solo_magazine_home/gp_solo_magazine_index/solo_lawyer_ethics_fee_client_relationship.html|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hourly rates===
The range of fees charged by lawyers varies widely from one city to the next.  Most large [[law firm]]s in the United States bill between $200 and $1,000 per hour for their lawyers' time, though fees charged by smaller firms are much lower.  The rate varies tremendously by location as well as the specific area of law practiced. Typically insurance defense firms have lower hourly rates than non-insurance firms, but are compensated by having steady, regular paying work provided. Regional urban centers such as [[Salt Lake City]] will average $150 per hour for an associate's time on a basic case, but will increase for larger firms. Within large firms in the United States billable hours are considered a measure of productivity with a minimum of 1,800 or so required, or expected, of associates.&lt;ref name=NYT032713&gt;{{cite news|title=The Tyranny of the Billable Hour|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/opinion/the-case-against-the-law-firm-billable-hour.html|accessdate=March 29, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 28, 2013|author=Steven J. Harper|format=op ed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, lawyers typically earn between $100,000 and $200,000 per year, although earnings vary by age and experience, practice setting, sex, and race.&lt;ref&gt;United States Census Bureau, American Community Survey&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United States Census Bureau, [https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-people.html Current Population Survey]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Labor, [http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes231011.htm Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.du.edu/documents/directory/publications/sterling/AJD2.pdf After the JD II]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://leiterlawschool.typepad.com/leiter/2016/06/will-the-new-york-times-correct-more-than-1-out-of-6-clear-factual-errors-in-noam-scheibers-coverage.html Why the New York Times Should Correct Remaining Factual Errors in Its Law School Coverage], Brian Leiter's Law School Reports&lt;/ref&gt;
Solo practitioners typically earn less than lawyers in corporate law firms but more than those working for state or local government.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://leiterlawschool.typepad.com/leiter/2016/07/how-much-do-lawyers-working-in-solo-practice-actually-earn-michael-simkovic.htmll "How Much Do Lawyers Working in Solo Practice Actually Make"]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Brian Leiter's Law School Reports&lt;/ref&gt;

Many surveys of hourly rates are done. The [[American Intellectual Property Law Association]] (AIPLA) commissions a survey of its members every two years and it publishes these in what it calls a "Report of the Economic Survey". The latest one is dated June 2007. Rates are collected for 14 geographic areas and by associate or partner.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.aipla.org for more information, although the Surveys are not made available online, but must be purchased.&lt;/ref&gt; Many courts have followed the rates shown by these AIPLA surveys and they are highly regarded for intellectual property litigation.

The [[Oregon State Bar|State Bar of Oregon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Hourly Rate Survey|url=http://www.osbar.org/surveys_research/08hourlyratesurvey|publisher=Oregon Bar Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Colorado Bar Association|Colorado State Bar]] have published surveys of rates for various areas of their states which are available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Economic Survey |url=http://www.cobar.org/repository/LPM%20Dept/2010EconSurvey.pdf |publisher=Colorado Bar Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014091730/http://www.cobar.org//repository/LPM%20Dept/2010EconSurvey.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most widely followed set of rates are what is called the [[Laffey Matrix]] available from the [[United States Attorney for the District of Columbia|United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia]]. These have been available since 1982 and are updated annually. Hourly rates are shown by years of experience. For June 1, 2006, to May 31, 2007, the rates are as follows: 20+ years of experience, $425 per hour; 11–19 years, $375; 8–10 years, $305; 4–7 years, $245; 1–3 years, $205; and [[paralegals]] and [[law clerk]]s, $120.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/dc/Divisions/Civil_Division/Laffey_Matrix_6.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Laffey Matrix appears to be growing in acceptance by many courts throughout the United States, but the matrix must be adjusted to account for higher or lower costs for legal services in other areas.

Hourly rates are increasing almost every year and some lawyers charge substantially higher than the rates shown by the Laffey Matrix. The first American attorney to regularly charge a four-digit hourly fee ($1,000 and higher) was [[Benjamin Civiletti]] in late 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Soltis, "Lawyer Rai$es the Bar – First-ever 1G/hr. Fee," ''[[New York Post]]'', 13 December 2005, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contingent fees===
{{main|Contingent fee}}
A contigent fee, or contingency fee, is an attorney fee that is made contingent on the outcome of a case. A typical contingent fee in a [[tort]] case is normally one third to forty percent of the recovery, but the attorney does not recover a fee unless money is recovered for the client. States prohibit contingent fees in certain types of cases. For example, most states forbid contingent fees in criminal cases. States typically require that a fee agreement that involves a contingent fee be reduced to writing and signed by the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Lawyer Fee Agreements and Retainers|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/consumer-protection/lawyer-fee-agreements-and-retainers|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=1 October 2017|date=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other fee arrangements===
With the ongoing recession of the 2000s, corporate clients began driving attorneys increasingly toward alternative fee arrangements (AFAs), which can include flat fees (per matter), fixed fees (for a "book" of matters), success bonuses, and other options.&lt;ref name="AFAs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/amlawdaily/2009/06/success-of-alternative-fees-depends-on-trust.html|title=GCs, Law Firms, and Flat Fee Arrangements: A Matter of Trust|work=typepad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent studies suggest that when lawyers charge a fixed-fee rather than billing by the hour, they work less hard on behalf of clients and client get worse outcomes.&lt;ref name="Brian Leiter's Law School Reports"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amanda Y. Agan"/&gt;

===Regulation of attorney fees===
In some types of cases, such as [[workers' compensation]] cases, attorney fees may be limited by statute, or subject to judicial review. Contingency fees in [[personal injury]] and [[medical malpractice]] cases are often capped by state law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethics: Contingency Fees for Lobbyists|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/ethics/50-state-chart-contingency-fees.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=1 October 2017|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, attorney fees may be subject to review for reasonableness. For example, in [[class action]] cases the court in which the case is resolved will review the attorney fees of class counsel for reasonableness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisenberg|first1=Theodore|last2=Miller|first2=Geoffrey P.|title=Attorney Fees in Class Action Settlements: An Empirical Study|journal=Journal of Empirical Legal Studies|date=March 2004|volume=1|issue=1|pages=27–78|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00002.x/full|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a landmark 1985 decision, ''Walters v. National Association of Radiation Survivors'', the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] held that statutory restrictions on attorney's fees are subject only to highly deferential [[rational basis review]] when challenged as limitations upon the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to freedom of speech and the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right to [[due process]].&lt;ref name="walters"&gt;''Walters v. National Ass'n of Radiation Survivors'', {{ussc|473|305|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, if the legislature can articulate ''any'' rational basis for restricting attorney's fees, the court must defer to the legislature's considered judgment, and it would take an "extraordinarily strong showing" for a court to decide otherwise.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; The Court then held that Congress had a rational basis for restricting attorney's fees in veterans' benefits cases to $10.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt;  In 2006, the statute at issue in ''Walters'' was heavily revised so as to remove the $10 attorney's fee restriction for most veterans' benefits cases. However, the principles articulated by the ''Walters'' court remain the law of the land for attorney's fees in general.&lt;ref&gt;''Department of Labor v. Triplett'', {{ussc|494|715|1990}} (applying ''Walters'' to attorney's fee restrictions in [[Black Lung Benefits Act of 1973]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Johnson v. Daley'', 339 F.3d 582 (7th Cir. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Long before the ''Walters'' case, conservatives in the United States had begun to put forward [[tort reform]] proposals to restrict attorney fees, which gained traction in the 1970s. Medical malpractice tort reforms often include maximum limits on plaintiffs' attorney fees, such as the percentage schedule in California's [[Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act]] of 1975. In 2004, [[Florida]] passed a constitutional amendment limiting contingent fees in [[medical malpractice]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flsenate.gov/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=Constitution&amp;Submenu=3#A01S26|title=Flsenate Archive: Statutes &amp; Constitution &gt; Constitution|work=flsenate.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=June 2011|reason=This is not a proper reference citation. Use [[Cite web]] or similar to provide source details.}}

Although some people have objected to these laws as an unfair restriction on [[freedom of contract]], Justice [[William Rehnquist]] shot down that argument in his majority opinion for the ''Walters'' court.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; Rehnquist implied that there was no principled way for the Court to overturn such laws as a violation of freedom of contract without returning to the now-discredited paternalism of the [[Lochner era]], in which the Court had routinely invoked freedom of contract as an excuse to overturn laws regulating [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wages]] and [[Child labor laws in the United States|child labor]].&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] filed a [[dissenting opinion]] in which he specifically attacked the majority opinion on that point, among others; he began and ended his dissent with the accusation that the majority "does not appreciate the value of individual liberty".&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt;

==Who pays==
Most countries operate under a "loser pays" system, sometimes called the [[English rule (attorney's fees)|English rule]] (in [[Law of England and Wales|English law]] it is described as "costs following the event"). Under the English rule, the losing party pays the successful party's legal costs (including lawyers' fees), as well as other court costs. The United States is a notable exception, operating under the [[American rule (attorney's fees)|American rule]], whereby each party is generally liable only for costs (i.e., [[photocopying]] fees, filing fees, etc.) ''but not'' the other side's attorney's fees unless a specific statute or rule of court provides otherwise. Some [[tort reform]] advocates propose adopting a "loser pays" rule in the United States. [[Federal district court]] and [[United States Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] judges award costs to the prevailing party under [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] 54.&lt;ref&gt;FRCP 54(d)&lt;/ref&gt;

In some jurisdictions, statutes may permit [[judge]]s and [[jury|juries]] to independently impose "loser pays"; for example, a judge may say: "I am ruling for the plaintiff on the amount of $[sum] plus all court costs and attorney fees". But generally, state court judges have no ''common law'' authority to award such fees against the losing party. Some [[Settlement (law)|settlement agreements]], [[arbitration]] agreements and other extrajudicial [[contract]]s may also stipulate a loser-pays arrangement.

A number of federal laws provide for an award of attorney fees for a prevailing [[plaintiff]], such as:
* [[Antitrust]] actions
* [[Civil rights]] violations, see [[Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act of 1976]]
* [[Class action]]s
* [[Copyright]] and [[patent]] cases
* [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] violations
* [[Lemon law]] cases
* Suits against the [[federal government]] where the position of the government was not "substantially justified"

Note that these "fee shifting" awards are a characteristic of the law enforced and do not necessarily depend upon the court in which they were brought; state courts can and do sometimes hear lawsuits brought under federal law. So if, for example, a person brings a civil rights action in state court and wins, he may be entitled to an award of attorney fees.

Most states have statutes under which attorneys' fees may be awarded to a prevailing plaintiff, such as an action on a contract where the contract contains a provision allowing recovery, or an action brought under [[consumer protection]] laws. Both plaintiffs and defendants are sometimes awarded attorneys fees in divorce and [[child custody]] actions, although this is an unusual circumstance, since such awards are made under the court's power to divide property or award [[alimony]] and [[child support]].

A majority of states allow generally for an award to any party in a lawsuit, if another party has forced him to expend money on attorneys fees to defend against a claim utterly or substantially lacking any possible merit and brought in bad faith (frequently called "abusive litigation" or a "frivolous lawsuit"). For example, in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], a trial court ''must'' award attorneys fees if a party has brought a claim "with respect to which there existed such a complete absence of any justiciable issue of law or fact that it could not be reasonably believed that a court would accept the asserted claim, defense, or other position".&lt;ref&gt;O.C.G.A. § 9-15-14(a).&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a trial court ''may'', but is not required to, award attorney's fees if a party has made a claim "that lacked substantial justification or...was interposed for delay or harassment, or if [the opposing party] unnecessarily expanded the proceeding by other improper conduct".&lt;ref&gt;O.C.G.A. § 9-15-14(b).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many ways of calculating prevailing-party attorney fees. Most courts recognize that actual costs may be disproportionate and inequitable. Thus, many [[jurisdiction]]s rely on other calculations. Many courts or laws invoke a ''lodestar''' calculation: reasonably expected billable hours multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate, sometimes multiplied by a factor reflecting the risk or complexity of the case. Courts in class actions frequently award fees proportionate to the damages recovered.  In 2013, a federal court awarded class counsel attorneys' fees totaling over $90 million for a $1.25 billion settlement in ''In Re Black Farmers Discrimination Litigation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Re Black Farmers Settlement Update 48|url=http://www.mysettlementclaims.com/blog/?p=1859|publisher=MySettlementClaims.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Class Action Fairness Act of 2005]], which, among other provisions, regulates the fees that can be awarded in a class action, was passed in response to concerns that courts were not adequately overseeing the award of such fees.

The overriding principle in awarding attorney’s fees is reasonableness. Courts will often reduce attorney’s fee awards they find to be unreasonable and excessive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sterlinganalytics.com/category/publications/|title=Publications - Sterling Analytics|work=sterlinganalytics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common examples of unreasonable billing include; billing for [[Overhead (business)|overhead]], overstaffing for uncomplicated tasks, rebilling recycled work product, and billing for improbably long days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sterlinganalytics.com/fee-drivers/ |title=Fee Drivers |work=sterlinganalytics.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915010459/http://www.sterlinganalytics.com/fee-drivers/ |archivedate=2011-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the private sector, many companies now use [[legal auditing]] to determine whether their outside counsel is billing them for excessive legal fees.

The '''Berlin State Library''' ({{lang-de|Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin}}; officially abbreviated as ''SBB'', colloquially ''Stabi'') is a [[universal library]] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] and a property of the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]]. It is one of the [[List of largest libraries|largest libraries]] in Europe, and one of the most important academic research libraries in the German-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/die-staatsbibliothek/portraet/ | title=Die Staatsbibliothek: Porträt|trans-title=About the State Library | date= | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=2012-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It collects texts, media and cultural works from all fields in all languages, from all time periods and all countries of the world, which are of interest for academic and research purposes. Among the more famous items in its collection are the oldest biblical illustrations, in the fifth-century [[Quedlinburg Itala fragment]], a [[Gutenberg Bible]], the main autograph collection of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], the world's largest collection of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s manuscripts, and the original score of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]].&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/die-staatsbibliothek/portrait/zahlen-und-fakten/ | title=Die Staatsbibliothek: Zahlen und Fakten | trans-title=Facts and Figures | date= | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=2012-02-01 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312011329/http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/die-staatsbibliothek/portrait/zahlen-und-fakten/ | archivedate=2012-03-12 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central functions and cooperation with other libraries==
The SBB is one of six libraries forming the [[Collection of German Prints|Arbeitsgemeinschaft Sammlung Deutscher Drucke (AG SDD)]] which "collaborate to build a comprehensive collection of printed literature published in German-speaking countries from the beginning of letterpress printing to the present, to provide information on it, to make it accessible to the public and to preserve it for future generations."&lt;REF name="AG-SDD_home"/&gt; This creates a virtual or distributed national library, in which each library is responsible for a given period, of which the SBB covers 1871 - 1912 for regular prints, 1801-1912 for maps and newspapers, and 1801-1945 for musical scores. 

Within the cooperation of German and Austrian libraries, the SBB is responsible "for the maintenance and further development of the ZDB", the central periodicals database. "The ZDB actually contains more than 1.8 million bibliographic records of serials from the 16th century onward, from all countries, in all languages, held in 3.700 German and Austrian libraries, with 15.6 million holdings information. It does not contain contents, i. e. journal articles."&lt;REF name="ZDB_home"/&gt; 

The SBB is one of 12 libraries and archives with significant holdings of historical documents which form the [[:DE:Allianz Schriftliches Kulturgut Erhalten]] -- ''Alliance to Preserve Written Cultural Heritage''. This alliance sets itself as main task raising the consciousness of the importance to preserve the century old cultural heritage both by securing the physical integrity of the objects in question as well as making them available in digitized form, thus preventing their deterioration by use. 

The SBB itself is digitizing their holdings and offers digitized newspapers for public access via the Web in their "newspaper information system" ZEFYS or ''Zeitungsinformationssystem''. ZEFYS "currently provides total of 281.990 issues from 192 historical newspapers from Germany and foreign newspapers in german."&lt;REF name="ZEFYS_Start"/&gt;

==History==
The history of the Berlin State Library closely parallels that of German history. It has lived through creation, neglect, expansion, war damage, division, unification and re-creation like few other libraries.

===Library of kings===
In the early period, the fortunes of the State Library rose and fell on royal whims. In 1658 [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]] decreed that his private books be organized, cataloged and made available to the public. His library opened in 1661 at [[Cölln]] as the "Library of the Elector" ({{lang-de|Churfürstliche Bibliothek zu Cölln an der Spree}}). In 1699, [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]] more than doubled the collection, extended opening hours and introduced the first Prussian [[legal deposit]] law. In 1701 it was renamed the "Royal Library" ({{lang-de|Königliche Bibliothek}}) upon Frederick I's accession as first [[King of Prussia]]. [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] then cancelled the acquisition budget in 1722 and gave away the valuable scientific collection to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1735. [[Frederick the Great]] also cared little for the library at first, preferring instead his own literature in the French language. However, in 1770 he granted the library substantial assets and it made several important acquisitions. To avoid the problems caused by its dependence on the crown, Frederick the Great also granted the library considerable autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/die-staatsbibliothek/geschichte/| title=Die Staatsbibliothek: Geschichte 1661-1810|trans-title=History 1661-1810 | date= | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=2012-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise to preeminence===
[[Image:Berlin-Mitte Bebelplatz2 05-2014.jpg|thumb|200px|''Old Royal Library'' on Bebelplatz]]
With new resources and authority, construction began on a Royal Library building on the [[Bebelplatz]] in the center of Berlin. Built between 1775 and 1785 by [[Georg Christian Unger]] to plans by [[Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach]], it's nicknamed the  ''Kommode'' (''Chest of drawers'') after its [[Neo Baroque]] design. The collection then underwent nearly continuous improvement and expansion. By 1905 it had become the largest and most influential repository of materials in the German language, and at 1.2 million books one of the largest libraries in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/die-staatsbibliothek/geschichte/| title=Die Staatsbibliothek: Geschichte 1810-1945|trans-title=History 1810-1945 | date= | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=2012-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bebelplatz building housed the library until 1914, when the headquarters moved into new, even larger premises on the [[Unter den Linden]]: the climax of the library's development before the [[World War I|First World War]]. Today the old Royal building houses the Faculty of Law of [[Humboldt University]].

At the founding of the [[Weimar Republic]] the library was renamed the "Prussian State Library" ({{lang-de|Preußische Staatsbibliothek - Preussischer Staatsbibliothek}}). After 1919, economic effects of war and inflation on the library were mitigated through the active support of the Emergency Association of German Sciences (after 1930, the [[German Research Foundation]]).

===War and destruction===
[[Image:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|thumb|200px|Book burning on the Bebelplatz, May 1933.]]
The [[Nazi Germany|Nazi period]] severely damaged the institution through political intimidation, employee dismissals, restrictions on foreign acquisitions and the effects of [[World War II]]. On 10 May 1933 a [[book burning]] ceremony was held at the [[Bebelplatz]] by members of the [[Deutsche Studentenschaft]], the [[National Socialist German Students' League]], [[Sturmabteilung]] "brownshirts" and [[Hitler Youth]] groups at the instigation of the Propaganda Minister, [[Joseph Goebbels]]. The [[Nazis]] burned over 20,000 books - mostly from the neighboring University, not the State library itself - including works by [[Thomas Mann]], [[Erich Maria Remarque]], [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Karl Marx]] and many others. Today a glass plate set into the Bebelplatz, giving a view of empty bookcases, commemorates the event. After an [[Allied bombing of Berlin in World War II|Allied bomb]] hit the [[Unter den Linden]] building in 1941, the various holdings (now some 3 million volumes and over 7,400 [[incunabula]]) were evacuated to 30 monasteries, castles and abandoned mines around Germany. By the end of the war, the main building was severely damaged, the valuable collections distributed across  allied zones of occupation, the library staff had been killed or scattered, and 700,000 volumes either [[book burning| destroyed]] or lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/die-staatsbibliothek/geschichte/| title=Die Staatsbibliothek: Geschichte 1946-|trans-title=History 1946- | date= | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=2012-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the formal dissolution of the State of [[Prussia]] in 1947, support for the library ended and the Prussian State Library ceased to exist.

===Rebuilding and reunification===

After 1945, parts of the collection that had been hidden in what became the [[Soviet occupation zone]] were returned to the war-damaged [[Unter den Linden]] building in [[East Berlin]]. It first opened in 1946 as the ''Public Scientific Library'' ({{lang-de|Öffentliche Wissenschaftliche Bibliothek}}). When further restoration work was completed in 1955, the library was renamed the ''German State Library'' ({{lang-de|Deutsche Staatsbibliothek}}). The great domed reading room, however, remained a ruin in the center of the building.

A larger proportion of the collection wound up in the American [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zone]], including a cache of 1.5 million volumes hidden in a [[potash]] mine near [[Hattorf]], and was moved to the [[University of Marburg]] in 1946. This collection first opened to the public as the ''Hessian Library'' ({{lang-de|Hessische Bibliothek}}) and in 1949, as the last lost stores arrived, it was renamed the ''West German Library'' ({{lang-de|Westdeutsche Bibliothek}}). Those parts of the collection that had been in the French [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zone]], mainly at [[Beuron Archabbey]], were gathered to the [[University of Tübingen]]. In 1962 the Federal Republic passed a law giving administrative responsibility for all these collections to [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]] and endowed it with State funding. During the 1960s, the various stocks, services and personnel began to be relocated to [[West Berlin]]. To house it all, a grand new building complex on the [[Kulturforum]] was constructed near the [[Berlin Wall]], just 1.5&amp;nbsp;km away from the library in [[East Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/die-staatsbibliothek/geschichte/| title=Die Staatsbibliothek: Geschichte 1945-1990|trans-title=History 1945-1990 | date= | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=2012-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Reunification of Germany|German Reunification]], the two institutions were formally reunited  in 1992. The new [[West Berlin]] building and the original [[East Berlin]] building became "one library with two homes" and the old State Library was reborn as the ''Berlin State Library''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/die-staatsbibliothek/geschichte/| title=Die Staatsbibliothek: Geschichte 1990-|trans-title=History since 1990 | date= | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=2012-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000 until 2012 Berlin State Library was refurbished by German architect [[HG Merz]]. The destroyed reading room, the core of the building, was replaced by a glass cube.

===Legacies of the past===

Many important items from the original collection are now located in [[Poland]] and territories of the former [[Soviet Union]] - declared as [[war reparations]], sometimes controversially - such as the ''[[Berlinka (art collection)|Berlinka Art Collection]]''. The original score of Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 8 (Beethoven)|8th Symphony]] is a starker example of division: while the first, second and fourth movements are in Berlin, the third is kept in [[Kraków]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/die-staatsbibliothek/portraet/ | title=Die Staatsbibliothek: Kriegsfolgen |trans-title=Consequences of War | date= | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=2012-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, it is estimated that about 10,000 volumes and 9,000 other items in the Berlin State Library are there as a result of [[Nazi plunder]]. Repatriation and self-criticism about these materials suffered from neglect, so in 2005 the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]] established the [[Center for Provenance Research]] to speed up the process. Sometimes, however, the past cannot be mended. In 2008 a Library user found an [[encyclopedia]] entitled ''Religion in History and the Present Day'' with a bookplate indicating it once belonged to a Jewish theologian. Library staff managed to find his widow in Israel, but she wrote back: "I appreciate your offer to return this book to me, but I have no use for it now." &lt;ref&gt;

The State Library operates from two major public sites, '''''Haus Unter Den Linden''''' and '''''Haus Potsdamer Straße''''', called the "Library in Two Homes".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web| url=http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/die-staatsbibliothek/portraet/ | title=Die Staatsbibliothek: Zwei Häuser|trans-title=Two Homes| date= | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=2012-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are additional subsidiary locations for newspapers, magazines, and archives not open to the public.

===Haus Unter Den Linden===
The original main building was built between 1908 and 1913 by the ''Prussian Construction and Financial Direction of Berlin'', then responsible for public constructions in the city. The [[Neo Baroque]] design is by popular [[Wilhelmine]] court architect [[Ernst von Ihne]] and was further adapted by [[Alexander Baerwald]], who was in charge of the construction management. In front of the building is an [[equestrian statue of Frederick the Great]]. The building was 40% damaged during [[World War II]], and after the [[division of Berlin]] wound up in [[East Berlin]]. It is undergoing a major expansion by [[HG Merz]], including a new translucent central reading room on the ruins of the old dome, and will become the main historical research library housing the collection up to and including 1945.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web| url=http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/die-staatsbibliothek/die-gebaeude/haus-unter-den-linden/ | title=Haus Unter den Linden|trans-title=| date= | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=2012-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haus Potsdamer Straße===
This is the newer building in the [[Kulturforum]] on [[Potsdamer Straße]] in [[West Berlin]], designed by [[Hans Scharoun]] with substantial participation by [[Edgar Wisniewski]]. Construction began in 1967 to house those parts of the library's evacuated holdings from the western Allied [[occupation zones]] at the end of World War II. After 11 years of construction, it was finally dedicated by Federal President [[Walter Scheel]] and opened to the public in 1978. It was renovated from 1999-2001. The building is currently being further redeveloped into a modern research library as a companion to the Haus Unter den Linden and will house the collection from 1946 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;

===Additional sites===
*'''Westhafen''': located in [[Berlin-Moabit]], this building is a renovated granary and houses the newspaper collection and the children and youth library. It also serves as a temporary site for other major collections while the Unter den Linden building is renovated.
*'''Friedrichshagen Storage Magazine''': located in [[Friedrichshagen]] and originally constructed in 1950 for various scientific agencies of the [[German Democratic Republic]], this site was renovated and expanded in 2011 into a technologically advanced storage facility for [[cultural artifacts]]. It encompasses 22,000 sq meters of climate-controlled space, and plans are in place to triple this size.

A '''bridge-spouted vessel''' is a particular design of [[ewer]] ([[jug]] or [[pitcher (container)|pitcher]]) originating in antiquity; there is typically a connecting element between the spout and filling aperture, and the spout is a completely independent aperture from the usually smaller central fill opening.  Early incidences of the bridge spouted vessel are found in [[Persia]] in the early [[Iron Age]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=bridge-spouted British Museum "Bridge spout"] on collection database&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[Crete]].  This type of vessel typically appears in the [[Bronze Age]] or early [[Iron Age]]. A very early example of a bridge spouted bowl has been recovered at the ancient [[palace]] of [[Phaistos]] on [[Crete]], dating to the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10881/cydonia.html#fieldnotes C.Michael Hogan, ''Phaistos Fieldnotes'', The Modern Antiquarian (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a different type, characteristic of the pottery of the [[Nazca culture]] of [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Peru]], where two spouts rising vertically from the body of the vessel are linked by a bridge that apparently also served as a carrying handle.

Redcoat is the name given to frontline staff at [[Butlins]] [[holiday camp]]s in the UK. A Redcoat has duties ranging from adult entertainer or children's entertainer to [[Stewardship|stewarding]].

==History==
[[File:Holiday Camp Gets Going Again- Everyday Life at a Butlin's Holiday Camp, Filey, Yorkshire, England, UK, 1945 D25923.jpg|left|thumb|Redcoats at Butlins [[Filey]] in 1947]]

The first Redcoat was [[Norman Bradford (Entertainer)|Norman Bradford]]. When Sir [[Billy Butlin]] opened his first Butlins in [[Skegness]] he realised that his guests were not engaging with activities in the way he had envisioned, most kept to themselves, and others looked bored. He asked Norman (who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes. By the end of the night the camp was buzzing and the Butlins atmosphere was born.

The same night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require an army of people to carry out the same job as Norman, and the role of Redcoat was formed.&lt;ref name="Butlins1"&gt;{{citation |title=Butlins Memories -Redcoats|url=http://www.butlinsmemories.com/other/redcoats.htm |publisher=Butlinsmemories.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear|left}}

===Uniform===
[[File:2 Redcoats at Butlin's Minehead March 2011.jpg|thumb|Redcoats with former England football player George Cohen, March 2011]]
To make his new army stand out, Butlin asked Norman to purchase a uniform. Norman later returned with a jacket in the camp colours of, blue, primrose yellow and white; however, Butlin found the look to be too authoritarian and decided they should wear red [[blazer]]s with white lapels and the '''Redcoat''' uniform was born. The first uniforms were made by Billie Ditchfield who became one of the first two female Redcoats (the other was Kay Berry).

Over the years the uniform has changed several times, but has always retained the core component of a red blazer (despite a proposal to replace them with red jumpsuits in the 1970s).&lt;ref name="Butlins1" /&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, braid and badges were added to the blazers. Famous designers such as [[Jeff Banks]] and [[Zandra Rhodes]] have redesigned the uniforms. To mark Butlins' 75th anniversary, the uniform was re-designed very similar to the original design consisting of Red Blazer with dark braiding and a badge with the letters "BHC" on (standing for "Butlins Holiday Camps") and white trousers or skirt. This uniform was worn throughout 2011 for the anniversary celebration, and from early 2016 it has once again become the permanent redcoat uniform.

=== Recruitment and training ===
[[File:Female redcoat March 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A female Redcoat wearing pleated white skirt, March 2011]]

The Redcoats undergo a tough selection process. Despite this they are still paid only [[minimum wage]] and members of the 'triple threat' cast team (such as the skyline gang) are paid more. Recruitment roadshows are held nationally on a yearly basis. In these Roadshows Prospective Redcoats have to show customer service and guest facing skills (contrary to the popular belief that they need to be able to sing and dance, which is no longer the case).&lt;ref name="Guardian1"&gt;{{citation |title=Could you be a Redcoat?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2006/nov/03/couldyoubearedcoat|work=The Guardian |location=London|first=Ed|last=Ewing|date=3 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WeAreButlins1"&gt;{{citation |title=Redcoat Auditions|url=http://www.wearebutlins.com/redcoataudition/|publisher=WeArebutlins }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Butlins Introduced the now defunct Butlins 'Academies of Excellence' to train Redcoats.&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{citation |title=Butlins loses hi-de-hi image|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/347557.stm|publisher=the BBC |date=19 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this has since been replaced with a 6&amp;nbsp;week training course.&lt;ref name="Guardian1" /&gt; There is also the option of a foundation degree in either musical theatre, or Technical Skills for the Arts and Leisure Industry&lt;ref name="BBC3"&gt;{{citation|title=Redcoat degree at seaside resort|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/7587695.stm|publisher=the BBC|date=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DM1"&gt;{{citation|title=The boffins of Butlins: University offers degrees in the finer arts of being a holiday camp Redcoat|url=

===Roles===
Redcoats work in three areas, General duties, the Kid's Club and the costume character team. General duties are similar to those of a tour rep in a resort – Butlins even describe the role as "The Original Holiday Rep"&lt;ref name="WeAreButlins1" /&gt; In the evening the Redcoats form part of the live entertainment team, starring in Gangshows and ''[[X-Factor]]'' style game shows.&lt;ref name="Guardian1" /&gt; Throughout the years, Redcoats have been expected to lead ballroom dances, stage and judge competitions, and steward theatrical performances as well as meeting and greeting guests in public areas. Redcoats run the children's clubs which provide sporting activities, competitions and arts and crafts. Each redcoat will have many different roles to fulfil in any given week.&lt;ref name="Butlins1" /&gt;

==Similar staff==
{{further|Holiday camp#Frontline staff}}

Butlins remained the largest holiday camp chain in the UK, but smaller camps copied the redcoat style of staffing. In the 1960s, Fred Pontin adopted the Bluecoat to represent at [[Pontins]] holiday camps,&lt;ref name="Pontins1"&gt;{{citation |title=Butlins Memories – Pontins|url=http://www.butlinsmemories.com/pontins/index.htm|publisher=butlinsmemories.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at some point, Harry Warner decided [[Warner Leisure Hotels|Warners]]' holiday camps should adopt the Greencoat.

==Media appearances==
The ITV series [[Redcoats (tv series)|''Redcoats'']] was a docusoap following the lives of Redcoats at Butlins [[Minehead]] and [[Bognor Regis|Bognor]] resorts. Over three series of 30-minute episodes, it shows the selection process, the Redcoats entertaining the visitors and life behind the scenes. The series was made by Pilgrim Productions.&lt;ref name="Pilgrim"&gt;{{citation|title=Redcoats|url=http://www.pilgrimproductions.co.uk/projredcoats.htm|publisher=Pilgrim Productions|access-date=28 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109054234/http://www.pilgrimproductions.co.uk/projredcoats.htm#|archive-date=9 January 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In fiction===
The BBC television series ''[[Hi-de-Hi!]]'', written by former Butlins employees [[Jimmy Perry]] (a Redcoat) and [[David Croft (TV producer)|David Croft]] (summer show actor),&lt;ref name="DavidCroft1"&gt;{{citation |title=Croft and Perry|url=http://www.davidcroft.co.uk/Croft-Perry/|publisher=davidcroft.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; featured the Yellowcoats as a fictional analogue. The title of the show ''"Hi-de-Hi"'' originated with Norman Bradford who claimed to have taken it from an American film; he began using this as a cheer to which the audience spontaneously responded "Ho-de-ho".&lt;ref name="NotebookNews1"&gt;{{citation|title=Butlins at Clacton, a History of the Man and the Holiday Camp|url=http://notebooknews.co.uk/Clactononsea/Butlins3.html|publisher=notebooknews.co.uk|access-date=28 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823102156/http://notebooknews.co.uk/Clactononsea/Butlins3.html#|archive-date=23 August 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Citizen82"&gt;{{citation|title=Citizen 82 [Programme 2]|url=http://www.macearchive.org/Media.html?Title=538|publisher=Central Television|access-date=28 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513191247/http://www.macearchive.org/Media.html?Title=538#|archive-date=13 May 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another BBC television series, ''[[Doctor Who]]'', featured an episode entitled ''[[Delta and the Bannermen]]'', which depicted an alien attack on the fictitious Shangri-La holiday camp (in reality the Butlins camp at [[Barry Island (holiday camp)|Barry Island]]). As with the real camp, Shangri-La was staffed with Redcoats played by extras.&lt;ref name="DrWho1"&gt;{{citation |title=Delta and the Bannermen|url=http://www.mentalis.co.uk/sylvester-mccoy/delta-and-the-bannermen.aspx|publisher=mentalis.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable former Redcoats==
A number of entertainers have been Redcoats in the early stages of their careers. Becoming a Redcoat is seen as a way into show business, as it allows a performer to become established as a professional for the purposes of joining the [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]] trade union which then allows the performer to work freely throughout the industry. In exceptional cases a Redcoat may even become notable whilst in the employment of Butlins; [[Stephen Mulhern]] notably performed on the [[Royal Variety Performance]] in 1997 whilst still working as a Redcoat,&lt;ref name="DailyMail1"&gt;{{citation |title=In-taxi with Stephen Mulhern|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-1174331/In-taxi--Stephen-Mulhern.html|work=Daily Mail|location=London|first=Benji|last=Wilson|date=2 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the past notable singers have had chart hits. [[Clinton Ford (singer)|Clinton Ford]], for instance, reached number 27 in 1959 with "[[Old Shep]]" just after completing his final summer season at [[Penychain (holiday camp)|Pwllheli]]. However, prior to this in 1957 [[Russ Hamilton (singer)|Russ Hamilton]] recorded a number 2 hit in the UK "We Will Make Love" (held off the top spot by [[Elvis Presley]] and "[[All Shook Up]]"). Shortly after this he recorded a number 4 hit in the US Billboard with the song "Rainbow", and all the time Hamilton continued to entertain Butlins guests. It was Billy Butlin himself who asked Hamilton to record "We Will Make Love" for the benefit of Butlins guests.&lt;ref name="Independant1"&gt;{{citation |title=Russ Hamilton: Liverpudlian singer-songwriter who had a hit in America years before the Beatles|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/russ-hamilton-liverpudlian-singersongwriter-who-had-a-hit-in-america-years-before-the-beatles-964176.html|work=The Independent|location=London|date=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artists have gone on to find success building on the skills they learned as a Redcoat, such as [[Des O'Connor]], [[Jimmy Tarbuck]], and [[Michael Barrymore]].&lt;ref name="BBC6"&gt;{{citation |title=Famous faces launched at Butlins|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4886610.stm|publisher=The BBC|date=11 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role is an important part of the entertainment and tourism culture of the United Kingdom, and even today former Redcoats are regularly identified in the press and in books by this role even though it may only have been a small part of their career.

Other famous Redcoats include [[Ted Rogers (comedian)|Ted Rogers]], a comedian best known as the presenter of the variety/game show ''[[3-2-1]]'', and Northern Irish entertainer [[Jimmy Cricket]].

[[File:Pierre taillée Melka Kunture Éthiopie fond.jpg|thumb|Right|280px|[[Oldowan]] to 1.7 million years before our era - [[Hadar, Ethiopia|Hadar]]]]

[[Archaeologist]]s define a '''chopper''' as a [[pebble tool]] with an irregular cutting edge formed through the removal of [[lithic flake|flakes]] from one side of a stone.

Choppers are crude forms of [[stone tool]] and are found in [[archaeological industry|industries]] as early as the [[Lower Palaeolithic]] from around 2.5 million years ago. These earliest known specimens were found in the [[Olduvai Gorge]] in [[Tanzania]] by [[Louis Leakey]] in the 1930s. The name [[Oldowan]] was given to the tools after the site in which they were excavated. These types of tools were used an estimated time range of 2.5 to 1.2 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;"Oldowan and Acheulean Stone Tools." Museum of Anthropology, College of Arts and Science, University of Missouri. N.p., n.d. Web. 19 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
To create this tool, one would have to use a [[hammerstone]] to chip away flakes on the stone to create a side of the stone with a very sharp edge, allowing for the cutting and hacking of an object. This is a unique type of [[lithic reduction]] due to only a single side of the stone being retouched to produce the cutting surface of the stone. The side that does not do the cutting is left unscathed, an unusual practice. These old instruments were made from specific materials. Initially, they were composed of [[quartz]], [[quartzite]], [[basalt]], or [[obsidian]]. In the later years of the oldowan age, two other materials were used: [[flint]] and [[chert]]. These materials could hold an edge while still being fairly easy to craft into the shape desired. The tool is designed to fit in the palm of the hand, and it is not attached to any other mount that could possibly be used. Known as one of the earliest tools (if not the earliest), its design is a very simple piece of technology, but its performance was very successful in many different scenarios. Seeing the history of these objects and how many cultures used them, it is not a surprise to find spread throughout the world. A potential stone mass found today could be classified as a chopper if a [[worn]] edge showing signs of evidence of tool use is present.&lt;ref&gt;"Choppers." Choppers. N.p., n.d. Web. 19 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
[[File:Chopper, Nationalmuseet.jpg|thumb|Chopper from [[Botswana]], in [[Danish National Museum]]]]
Choppers are not solely limited to a single area on Earth:
*As mentioned earlier, Africa is known to have supplied the earliest known choppers, specifically known as the oldowan. Many countries have given sites containing many of these stone tools, including Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa. 
*In North America, similar stone tools have been found in south and southwestern states, such as Oklahoma. 
*Europe also has been the home to choppers, with assemblages of stone tools having been found in Europe. Many countries have had oldowans found within them, including Sweden, Portugal, Georgia, Bulgaria, Russia, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and the United Kingdom.

*A large assemblage of stone lithics were found in Northern Thailand, the Sao Din excavation. Out of the 139 artifacts recovered, many of them fell into the chopper category. These findings helped set Southeast Asian [[stone technology]] apart from the classic European [[Acheulean]] assemblages.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitoun V, Forestier H, Auetrakulvit P, Khaokhiew C, Rasse M, Davtian G, Winayalai C and Tiamtinkrit C 2012.

Although many choppers have been found in each region, this does not mean that the tools found are similarly made. Differences include the shape, length, material used, and other factors. This shows the variation among ancient cultures of the time and how each suited specific needs for each community.

==Usage==
The ancient peoples that inhabited the earth had many different stone tools to perform various activities. Choppers were used in equal amounts for woodworking, presumably for sharpening spears, and meat processing. However, choppers were used for many different purposes. Used for hacking, cutting, and chopping, choppers allowed early peoples to sever soft materials, especially meat and wood. One of the main uses of choppers was to cut through the meat and skins of hunted animals to obtain food, hide, and fur. The sharpness of the tool improved the overall process. Ridges and cut marks on bones can prove their use for the task. Also, these tools were used on plants, such as digging up roots and shaving and chopping wood.&lt;ref&gt;"Early Human Evolution: Early Human Culture." Early Human Evolution: Early Human Culture. N.p., n.d. Web. 18 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advancement over time==
Later in history, it seems that choppers were being outdated by newer technology. The handheld tools for scraping and cutting were no longer sought after, for tools with shapes that fit the hand seemed to be the upcoming trend. Starting about 1.6 million years ago, this new technology evolution emerged, known as the Acheulean tradition. Tools classified under this category are known as the earliest indicators of [[hand axe]] usage. The biggest difference from the early oldowan tools, or choppers, is the fact that two sides have had flakes chipped off, versus the single side of the chopper.&lt;ref&gt;"Oldowan and Acheulean Stone Tools." Museum of Anthropology, College of Arts and Science, University of Missouri. N.p., n.d. Web. 19 Nov. 2013.v&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early ideas==
Initial theories proposed by G. Isaac (1970s) that choppers were used for hunting and butchering. However, the size of the choppers did not suggest that it could be powerful enough to actually kill animals like the [[hippopotamus]]. L. Binford then proposed that animals were killed by carnivores and ''[[Homo]]'' was just a scavenger. This theory was tested by P. Shipman and R. Potts. Since the cutmarked bones were tooth marked and there were no carcasses or disarticulation of any leftovers, the evidence pointed at the idea of ''Homo'' being a scavenger.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="189079">The [[Book of Joshua]] lists almost 400 ancient [[Levant]]ine city names (including alternative names and derivatives in the form of words describing citizens of a town) which refer to over 300 distinct locations in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]. Each of those cities, with minor exceptions (e.g. [[Hamath]], [[Gubla]]) is placed in one of the 12 regions, according to the [[tribes of Israel]] and in most cases additional details like neighbouring towns or geographical landmarks are provided. It has been serving as one of the primary sources for identifying and locating a number of [[Middle Bronze Age|Middle Bronze]] to [[Iron Age]] [[Levant]]ine cities mentioned in ancient [[Egypt]]ian and [[Canaan]]ite documents, most notably in the [[Amarna correspondence]].

[[File:1885 Punch head toss.png|thumb|right|Extract from a [[cartoon]] by Priestman Atkinson, from the Punch Almanack for 1885, mocking  clichéd expressions in the popular literature of the time]]
A '''cliché''' or '''cliche''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|iː|ʃ|eɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|k|l|ɪ|ˈ|ʃ|eɪ}}) is an expression, idea, or element of an artistic work which has become overused to the point of losing its original meaning or effect, even to the point of being trite or irritating, especially when at some earlier time it was considered meaningful or novel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', pg. 85. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[phraseology]], the term has taken on a more technical meaning, referring to an [[Phraseme#Clichés|expression imposed by conventionalized linguistic usage]]. The term is frequently used in modern culture for an action or idea that is expected or predictable, based on a prior event. Typically pejorative, "clichés" may or may not be true.&lt;ref&gt;Short Story Library [http://shortstory.us.com/2009/05/thick-skin-and-writing-cliche-but-true/ Thick skin and writing, cliché, but true] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226023613/http://shortstory.us.com/2009/05/thick-skin-and-writing-cliche-but-true/ |date=2010-02-26 }} - Published By Casey Quinn • May 10th, 2009 • Category: Casey's Corner&lt;/ref&gt; Some are [[stereotype]]s, but some are simply [[truism]]s and [[fact]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Cliche The Free Dictionary - Cliche]&lt;/ref&gt; Clichés often are employed for [[comedy|comic]] effect, typically in fiction.

Most phrases now considered clichéd originally were regarded as striking, but have lost their force through overuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Mason | first1 = David | authorlink1 = David Mason (writer) | last2 = Nims | first2 = John Frederick | authorlink2 = John Frederick Nims | year = 1999 | title = Western Wind: An Introduction to Poetry | publisher = McGraw-Hill | pages = 126&amp;ndash;127 | isbn = 0-07-303180-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French poet [[Gérard de Nerval]] once said, "The first man who compared woman to a rose was a poet, the second, an imbecile."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linternaute.com/biographie/gerard-de-nerval/ Biography and Quotations of Gérard de Nerval]&lt;/ref&gt;

A cliché is often a vivid depiction of an abstraction that relies upon [[analogy]] or [[exaggeration]] for effect, often drawn from everyday experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Loewen|first=Nancy|title=Talking Turkey and Other Clichés We Say|year=2011|publisher=Capstone|isbn=1404862722|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Cliché|url=http://literarydevices.net/cliche/|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Used sparingly, it may succeed, but the use of a cliché in writing, speech, or argument is generally considered a mark of inexperience or a lack of originality.

== Origin ==
The word cliché is drawn from the [[French language|French]] language. In printing, "cliché" came to mean a [[stereotype (printing)|stereotype]], electrotype or cast [[printing plate|plate]] or block reproducing words or images that would be used repeatedly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Westwood|first=Alison|title=The Little Book of Clichés|publisher=Canary Press eBooks|isbn=1907795138}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the word originated from the clicking sound in "dabbed" printing (a particular form of stereotyping in which the block was impressed into a bath of molten type-metal to form a matrix).&lt;ref name="Mosley Dabbing"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mosley|first1=James|title=Dabbing, abklatschen, clichage...|url=http://typefoundry.blogspot.co.uk/2006/01/dabbing-abklatschen-clichage.html|website=Type Foundry (blog)|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Printing cliches"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bergel|first1=Giles|title=Printing cliches|url=http://www.printing-machine.org/notes/2016/6/4/printing-cliches|website=Printing Machine (blog)|accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this [[onomatopoeia]], "cliché" came to mean a ready-made, oft-repeated phrase.

==Usage==
[[File:Nambe Lake cliche.jpg|thumb|right|Using a feature such as an overhanging branch to frame a nature scene&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Freeman | first = Michael | year = 2004 | title = Nature and Landscape Photography | publisher = Lark Books | page = 36 | isbn = 1-57990-545-5 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=0bGIPv-OR6UC&amp;pg=PA36 | accessdate = 2009-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be described as a visual cliché even though it also supplies scale.]]

The term was popularized by psychiatrist [[Robert Jay Lifton]] in his 1961 book, ''[[Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism: A Study of "Brainwashing" in China]]''.&lt;ref name="Taylor2006"/&gt; Lifton wrote, "The language of the totalist environment is characterized by the thought-terminating cliché. The most far-reaching and complex of human problems are compressed into brief, highly reductive, definitive-sounding phrases, easily memorized and easily expressed. These become the start and finish of any ideological analysis".&lt;ref name="cliche"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lifton |first=Robert J. |title=Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism: A Study of Brainwashing in China |page=429 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FU_ifHrIIg0C&amp;pg=PA429&amp;dq=%22Thought-terminating+clich%C3%A9%22+totalism&amp;ei=36VxS9WhBZLKMObN7PkF&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |year=1989 |publisher=UNC Press|isbn=978-0-8078-4253-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they are used in a deliberate attempt to shut down debate, manipulate others to think a certain way, or dismiss dissent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8171">'''David Glenn Hays''' (November 17, 1928 – July 26, 1995) was a [[linguist]], [[computer scientist]] and [[social scientist]] best known for his early work in [[machine translation]] and [[computational linguistics]].

== Career overview ==

David Hays graduated from Harvard College in 1951 and received his Ph.D. in 1956 from Harvard's Department of Social Relations. In 1954-1955 he held a fellowship at the Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford and took a job at the RAND Corporation, Santa Monica in 1955, where he remained though 1968. In 1969 he joined the faculty of the State University of New York at Buffalo where he was founding chairman of the newly formed linguistics department and Professor of Linguistics, of Computer Science, and of Information and Library Studies. He remained at Buffalo until 1980 when he retired from the university and moved to New York City, where he worked as a private consultant and pursued independent research in cultural evolution and the arts, especially the ballet. He was on the Editorial Board of the ''Journal of Social and Evolutionary Systems'' and starting in 1989 was a member of [[Connected Education]]'s online faculty for their MA in Media Studies offered through The New School.

== Language and computation ==

During his years at RAND he worked on the machine translation of Russian technical literature into English and more generally on computational linguistics, a term that he created. The syntactic component of the RAND system was based on [[Lucien Tesnière]]'s [[dependency grammar]] and Hays became its principal advocate in America. More than anyone else Hays is responsible for the realization that language processing should consist in the application of theoretically motivated grammars to specific texts by general algorithms. In 1967 Hays published the first textbook in computational linguistics, ''Introduction to Computational Linguistics''. At his direction RAND assembled an annotated corpus of a million words of Russian text, and thus pioneered in what is now known as [[corpus linguistics]].

== Culture and cognition ==

After leaving RAND and assuming his position at Buffalo, Hays turned to more a more general interest in language and [[cognition]] and, ultimately, the evolution of human culture. He developed an approach to [[abstract concepts]] in which their meaning was grounded in stories. Hays elaborated this idea in a series of articles and several of his graduate students, including Brian Phillips, Mary White, and William Benzon, employed the idea in their work. In 1982 he published ''Cognitive Structures'', in which he developed a novel scheme for grounding cognition in perception and action as conceived in the [[control theory]] of [[William T. Powers]]. Working with William Benzon, he published a neural interpretation of this theory in 1988. During the 1980s and early 1990s he and Benzon developed a theory of cultural rank which they published in a series of papers (together and individually) and a book on the [[history of technology]] (Hays alone) in the early 1990s. His last major work was a critical review and synthesis of the empirical work that anthropologists and archaeologists had done on [[cultural complexity]]. This book was published posthumously as ''The Measurement of Cultural Evolution in the Non-Literate World: Homage to Raoul Naroll.'' At the time of his death, he had embarked on a study of the ballet, looking to understand how motion generates emotion.

== Professional service ==

Hays played an important role in the professional organization of computational linguistics. He advocated the organization of the ''[[Association for Computational Linguistics]]'' and served as its second president in 1964. He was the first editor of its journal, ''[[Computational Linguistics (journal)|Computational Linguistics]]'' (then called the ''American Journal of Computational Linguistics'') from 1974 to 1978; the journal was originally published on microfiche to facilitate rapid publication and allow for longer articles than is practical in hard-copy publication. He was one of the founders of the [[International Committee on Computational Linguistics]], served as its chairman from 1965 to 1969 and was an honorary member from 1965 to 1995.

"'''Days of Future Future'''" is the eighteenth episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 25)|25th season]] of the American [[animated sitcom]] ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and the 548th episode of the series. It first aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on April 13, 2014. It was written by [[J. Stewart Burns]] and directed by [[Bob Anderson (director)|Bob Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-simpsons-2014/episode-18-season-25/days-of-future-future/100521 |title=The Simpsons Episode Guide 2014 Season 25 - Days of Future Future, Episode 18 |publisher=TVGuide.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode is a sequel to "[[Future-Drama]]" and a continuation of "[[Holidays of Future Passed]]", set 30 years from the present. In this futuristic installment, Bart goes to a clinic to rid himself of his feelings for his ex-wife Jenda (who is now dating a [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|xenomorph]]-like alien named Jerry), Lisa must choose whether or not to cure her zombie husband Milhouse after he gets bitten by a homeless zombie, and Marge (after putting up with years of Homer dying and being cloned back to life by Professor Frink) loads Homer onto a flatscreen monitor and throws him out of the house.

==Plot==
[[Marge Simpson|Marge]] wakes to find [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] atop of the kitchen table in nothing but his underwear, and gives him advice on his health. Just when Homer seems to be taking Marge's words to heart, he marches upstairs to tell his wife that he will take his health seriously only to fall down the stairs and die. At his funeral, [[Professor Frink]] announces that he has made a [[Cloning|clone]] of Homer, and Marge warns Homer to take this second chance seriously. After thirty years of clones dying, Frink cannot bring Homer back, but has stored his memory in a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]], which he plugs into a television screen. When Marge realizes that her husband is just a face on a screen, she is fed up with him, and gives the flash drive to [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], so that Homer can reside with him until she can figure out a way to get used to him in his current form.

Bart shows Homer his new digs, an abandoned classroom at Springfield Elementary. As soon as a glum Bart sends his two sons to his ex-wife Jenda's house, he needs advice more than ever now, but Homer is of no use when the monitor freezes. Working at a dinosaur amusement park, Bart laments that he misses his children. Elsewhere at [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]'s zombie soup kitchen, her husband [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] is attacked by a zombie. Unable to move on from his ex, Bart sees a targeted billboard telling him to move on using shock therapy that makes him forget. After the procedure, Bart visits Marge, who claims to not miss Homer that much, but in an attempt to initiate a conversation between her and Homer, he sees she does miss Homer.

Homer returns to normal when Bart starts to get back into the dating scene, and sleeps with one woman after another, including Lisa's former teacher, Miss Hoover. At Bart's apartment, Homer gets a new lease of life in a robot suit. Bart's sons visit him and ask him to help Jenda out with her depression. She shows up in tears, telling Bart that after she bought a shedding tank for Jerry, her alien boyfriend, he humiliated her and broke up with her for someone else. Bart comforts her by mentioning he is trying to get his life on track and her crying is a reminder of what he lost. Jenda is impressed by Bart's newfound maturity and invites him to dinner. It goes well and the two decide to patch up their relationship again. However, the two later fall into their bad habits of not paying attention to each other that destroyed their marriage the first time, and become unsure whether to continue working things out. Meanwhile, Lisa and zombie Milhouse are attacked by bullies, and Lisa actually finds it attractive that Milhouse fights them off. She does not want him cured and is stalked by Dr. Hibbert who is not happy about her decision.

Bart and Lisa both go to Moe's to deal with their respective marital problems, where Marge tells them to stick through. She then electrocutes herself to death in order to live in the flash drive with Homer. Milhouse is cured and Bart moves on from Jenda, discovering that she has started seeing Jerry again.

Bart then finds himself back in the therapist's chair, and learns that what he experienced was just a neural implant. Bart and Lisa visit Marge and find out that she and Homer have finally gotten back together, and she gave him a new robot body and personality. Bart recommends Lisa try moving on if things do not work out with her and Milhouse, but Lisa points out that Milhouse is still a zombie and there is no cure, much to her own affection, and Santa's Little Helper is seen talking.

==Reception==
Dennis Perkins of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a C, saying "Things are even worse for ''The Simpsons'' after tonight’s sequel, “Days Of Future Future,” where Burns returns to the (it seems) inevitable sci-fi future of the series and limits the show’s world even more. Losing much of the heart of its predecessor in favor of the sort of ill-conceived and contradictory character arcs the latter, scattershot ''Simpsons'' has become notorious for, “Days Of Future Future” reveals a series willing to shrug off what it still could be. Instead, this future Simpsons world seems just a playground for writers to use up whatever Futurama jokes they had left over."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perkins |first=Dennis |url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/simpsons-days-future-future-203397 |title=The Simpsons: "Days Of Future Future" |publisher=Avclub.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Sokol]] of ''[[Den of Geek]]'' gave the episode four out of five stars, saying "''The Simpsons''’s “Days of Future Future” is a laugh every 2.5 seconds, allowing for wind resistance. A very worth entry into what will someday be an even longer running longest running show that has ever walked slowly up a flight of stairs. I absolutely love Jerry, Bart’s future ex-wife’s new soon to be ex-Alien lover. Nelson’s mom still has to strip at the age of 87 because there is no more retirement. Even with 99 Democrats in the Senate, because the Republican still knows how to get things his way. Of course Ralph Wiggum will be the new chief of police, he is a chip off the old cop. Santa’s Little Hybrid is an unnatural progression that Cosmo does not teach about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tony Sokol |url=http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/234675/the-simpsons-days-of-future-future-review |title=The Simpsons: Days of Future Future, review |publisher=Denofgeek.us |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teresa Lopez of ''TV Fanatic'' gave the episode four out of five stars, saying "I always love The Simpsons episodes that show the possible futures of Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Homer and Marge. And this week was no exception. Even though the future episodes are not technically canon (I mean, who can say what will really happen in their future?), I liked that this one attempted some continuity." She did, however, criticize the episode's plot twist near the end, saying "What didn't work so well for me in this week's future glimpse was the way in which a portion of the show's events didn't actually take place. They were merely the work of the neural implant that the "Moving On" store used to help Bart get over his ex-wife. Although, the series did a nice job referring back to this little plot quirk at the end."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ryan |url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2014/04/the-simpsons-review-moving-on/ |title=The Simpsons Review: Moving On |publisher=TV Fanatic |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode received a 1.7 rating and was watched by a total of 3.64 million people, making it the second most watched show on [[Animation Domination]] that night, beating ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' and ''[[American Dad!]]'' but losing to ''[[Family Guy]]'' with 4.39 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/04/15/sunday-final-ratings-resurrection-once-upon-a-time-the-simpsons-the-amazing-race-cosmos-the-mentalist-60-minutes-ad/253972/ |title=Sunday Final Ratings: ‘Resurrection’, ‘Once Upon a Time’, ‘The Simpsons’, ‘The Amazing Race’, ‘Cosmos’, ‘The Mentalist’ &amp; ‘America’s Funniest Home Videos’ Adjusted Up; ’60 Minutes’ Adjusted Down |publisher=Tvbythenumbers |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dillingham Flaw''' is a phenomenon of faulty logic when nativists misinterpret and react negatively to the presence of immigrants in their midst. The term was coined by U.S. sociologist [[Vincent N. Parrillo]] to identify the centuries-old phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Parrillo, Vincent N., “Diversity in America: A Sociohistorical Analysis,” ''Sociological Forum'' 9:4 (1994): 523-45.&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Parrillo drew the name from a special commission created in 1907 by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to look into the “immigration problem.” Named after its chairman, U.S. Senator [[William P. Dillingham]] of Vermont, the [[Dillingham Commission]] over a 4-year period listened to testimony from civic leaders, educators, social scientists, and social workers and made on-site visits to [[Ellis Island]] and [[New York City]]’s [[Lower East Side]]. In 1911, the Commission issued a 41-volume report of its findings.  Unfortunately, the report was flawed in its interpretation of the data that the Commission had so tirelessly collected. The Commission erred in its use of simplistic categories for diverse immigrant groups and in making an unfair comparison of “old” and “new” immigrants, despite the changed structural conditions and longer time interval that previous immigrants had to assimilate and to achieve some measure of economic security.&lt;ref&gt;Benton-Cohen, Katherine, “The Rude Birth of Immigration Reform,” ''The Wilson Quarterly'' 34:3 (Summer 2010): 16-22; Weisberger, Bernard A., “Genes, Brains, and Bunk,” ''American Heritage'' 46:2 (1995): 28-9; Lund, John M., “Boundaries of Restriction: The Dillingham Commission,” ''History Review'' 6 (1994), accessed at [http://www.uvm.edu/~hag/histreview/vol6/lund.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Dillingham Flaw'' refers to inaccurate comparisons of immigrant groups based on simplistic categorizations and anachronistic observations. Parrillo argued that this erroneous thinking can occur in assessments of the past, present, or future.

==The past==

Applying modern classifications or sensibilities to a time when they did not exist, or, if they did, had a different form or meaning, is one version of the Dillingham Flaw. For example, today’s term ''British'' refers collectively to the people of the [[United Kingdom]] (the [[English people|English]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], and [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]]).  However, in the 18th century, ''British'' had the much narrower meaning for only the English, and for good reason. The English, Welsh, Scots, and Scots-Irish may have all been English-speaking, but significant cultural and religious differences existed among them and they did not view each other as “similar.”&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, Lawrence H., ''The American Kaleidoscope: Race, Ethnicity, and the Civic Culture'', Hanover, NH: Wesleyan University Press of New England, 1990, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Anyone who presumes that the colonial British, even just the colonial English, were a single cohesive entity, and thus the [[Thirteen Colonies|13 English colonies]] were homogeneous, would fall victim to the Dillingham Flaw.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Gary B., ed., ''Class and Society in Early America'', Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1970, p. 19; Vincent N. Parrillo, ''Diversity in America'', 3d ed.  Los Angeles: Pine Forge Press, 2009, pp. 15, 39-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar trap is speaking about either [[Slavery in the United States|African slaves]] or [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as single, monolithic entities generations ago. Such [[ethnocentric]] generalizations fail to acknowledge that these groups actually consisted of diverse peoples with distinctive languages, cultures, and behavior patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Bridenbaugh, Carl, ''Myths and Realities: Societies of the Colonial South'', reprint ed., Santa Barbara, Calif: Greenwood Press, 1981; Alvin M. Josephy, Jr., ''The Indian Heritage of America'', New York: Mariner Books, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, European immigrants were not alike, despite their collective groupings by mainstream society.&lt;ref&gt;Handlin, Oscar, ''The Uprooted: The Epic Story of the Great Migrations That Made the American People'', 2d ed.  Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, all of these groups—African American, Native American, and immigrant—were diverse peoples with many distinctions that set them apart from one another.

==The present==

Similar misconceptions can, and often do, occur in one’s own time. Working from a false premise about past rapid assimilation and cultural homogeneity, some individuals employ what they believe is an objective comparison with the present scene, which they find troubling in its heterogeneity and supposedly non-assimilating groups. Like the 1907 Dillingham Commission, they may be susceptible to mistaken impressions about a “threat” posed by recent immigrants whose presence and behavior they view as different from earlier immigrants.

The most common examples are expressed views that today’s immigrant minorities present an unprecedented challenge to an integrative society. Reacting to the increasing presence—even in many nonurban settings—of nonwhite newcomers speaking a foreign tongue, including many from a non-Judeo-Christian background, nativists view with alarm these demographic changes. Such fears are echoes of those raised about earlier groups, such as the racist responses to the physical appearance of southern Europeans or the anti-Semitic reactions to eastern European Jews.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Milton M. Gordon, ''Assimilation in American Life'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1964, p. 97; Madison Grant, ''The Passing of the Great Race'', reprint ed., Charleston, SC: Nabu Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;   In reality, studies consistently reveal rapid English language acquisition among all immigrants groups&lt;ref&gt;Hakimzadeh, Shirin, and D’Vera Cohn, “English Usage among Hispanics in the United States,” Pew Hispanic Center, November 29, 2007; Rubén G. Rumbaut, Douglas Massey, and Frank D. Bean, “Linguistic Life Expectancies: Immigrant Language Retention in Southern California,” ''Population and Development Review'', 32 (2006): 447–60; Rubén G. Rumbaut and Alejandro Portes, ''Ethnicities: Children of Immigrants in America'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  and higher naturalization rates among non-Westerners.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, James, and Nancy Rytina, ''Naturalizations in the United States: 2008'', Office of Immigration Statistics, March 2009, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The future==

Using oversimplified categorizations and imposing present-day sensibilities—the essence of the Dillingham Flaw—also can occur when individuals engage in demographic projections. For example, the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] projects that [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]] will comprise about 30 percent of the total U.S. population in 2050.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census Bureau, “National Population Projections,” 2008, accessed at {{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/projections/summarytables.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108204316/http://www.census.gov/population/www/projections/summarytables.html |archivedate=2008-11-08 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;   Given past patterns and current trends, however, we cannot be certain that today’s group categories, such as Hispanic, will still be valid by then.

Currently, most white Americans bear witness to mixed European ancestry, but two generations ago, Americans of southern, central, and eastern European backgrounds were far more likely to be of a single national lineage and religion. Their single-group identities evolved into multiple-group identities, as large-scale intermarriages generated such a blending of peoples that “whites” and “European Americans” became synonymous. Further, their mixed heritage is now more likely to be passively acknowledged, except for occasional symbolic celebrations. It is no longer an element of everyday ethnicity, subcultural participation, or minority status.

Each succeeding year shows greater numbers of exogamous marriages among ethnic, racial, and religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census Bureau, ''2011 Statistical Abstract'', Table 60&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, it is not unreasonable, for example, to suggest—given the annual increase in Hispanics marrying non-Hispanics&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census Bureau, ''2011 Statistical Abstract'', Table 60&lt;/ref&gt;—that in two generations many of the descendants of today’s Hispanic Americans will claim a mixed heritage, partly Hispanic and partly non-Hispanic. Projections that the mid-21st century will find the United States with a Hispanic population totaling 30 percent suggests a demographic categorization by today’s realities that may well not fit the reality then.

A similar argument could be made for other groups, as racial intermarriages continue to create a growing multiracial population.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census Bureau, ''2011 Statistical Abstract'', Table 60&lt;/ref&gt;  Using today’s categories for Americans living in 2050 can easily be another unwitting application of the Dillingham Flaw.  Projecting our perceptions and the existing social distance between groups onto a distant future carries a presumption that they will remain the same. However, our present-day categories may be inadequate or irrelevant to our descendants.

'''Domus de Janas''' ([[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]: "House of the Fairies" or of the "Witches") are a type of [[pre-Nuragic Sardinia|pre-Nuragic]] [[chamber tomb]]s found in [[Sardinia]]. They consist of several chambers quarried out by the people of the [[San Ciriaco culture|San Ciriaco]] through [[Ozieri culture]]s&lt;ref name=Portale1&gt;[http://www.ilportalesardo.it/archeo/percorsi/janas.htm ''Domus de Janas'', Portale Sardo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061240/http://www.ilportalesardo.it/archeo/percorsi/janas.htm |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent cultures, resembling houses in their layout.
[[File:Porto Torres - Su Crucifissu Mannu (2).JPG|thumb|Bull's horns, [[necropolis of Su Crucifissu Mannu]], [[Porto Torres]]]]
Built mostly between 3400 and 2700 BC, they date to the late [[Neolithic]], [[Chalcolithic]] and early [[Bronze Age]]. A necropolis of them at the site of [[Necropolis of Anghelu Ruju|Anghelu Ruju]], near [[Alghero]], consists of 38 tombs. Other large sites are those of ''[[Necropolis of Montessu|Montessu]]'', near [[Villaperuccio]], and of ''[[Necropolis of Sant'Andrea Priu|Sant'Andrea Priu]]'' at [[Bonorva]]. Many other domus de janas can be found throughout the island, with the excpetion of [[Gallura]] (where the deceased were usually buried in [[megalithic]] circles, such as that those of [[necropolis of Li Muri|Li Muri]]).

The shape of the internal chambers can vary from that of a rounded hut with conical or triangular ceiling. The walls are often decorated with reliefs or etchings depicting magical and religious symbols such as [[spiral]]s, [[zig-zag]] motifs and [[bull]]'s [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]].&lt;ref name=Portale2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilportalesardo.it/archeo/percorsi/janas.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061240/http://www.ilportalesardo.it/archeo/percorsi/janas.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The corpses, painted with red [[ochre]] like the tomb's walls, were buried together with common life objects, jewels and tools. According to archaeologist [[Giovanni Lilliu]], they were buried under shells of [[mollusc]]s; according to other theories, they were left outside the tomb, being put inside only after they had reduced to a skeleton.

The '''East Turkestan Information Center''' ({{lang-ug|Sherqiy Türkistan Informatsiyon}}; [[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''ETIC''') is a group affiliated with the [[East Turkestan independence movement]]. It was founded in [[Munich]], [[Germany]] in 1996, and has an office in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/uighur.htm |title=Uighurs |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=2003-12-15 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ETIC publishes reports on human rights violations and abuses by the [[Government of China|Chinese government]] towards China's ethnic [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] population.&lt;ref name="unhcr"&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,EURASIANET,,CHN,,46c58f2f23,0.html |title=Refworld &amp;#124; Kyrgyz rights activists call for end to deportation of Uighurs to China |publisher=UNHCR |date=2004-01-25 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15 2003, the ETIC was designated as a terrorist organization by the [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/xw/t56257.htm |title=China seeks int'l support in counter-terrorism(12/15/03) |publisher=China-embassy.org |date=2003-12-15 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Oxford Analytica]] says could be an excuse for repression of the Uyghur population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxan.com/display.aspx?ItemID=DB88349|title=China increases suppression in Xinjiang|publisher=Oxford Analytica|accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ETIC's head, Abdujelil Karakash was quoted by the [[UNHCR]] saying:&lt;ref name="unhcr"/&gt;
{{Quote|text=We have no connection with terrorists. Actually, China itself is a terrorist. It occupied our territory, our soil, our riches. Every day, it sends about 30,000 Chinese to East Turkestan, and 100 percent of them stay there.|sign=Abdujelil Karakash}}

'''Fauvism''' is the style of '''''les Fauves''''' ([[French language|French]] for "the wild beasts"), a group of early twentieth-century [[modern art]]ists whose works emphasized [[painterly]] qualities and strong color over the [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] values retained by [[Impressionism]]. While Fauvism as a style began around 1904 and continued beyond 1910, the [[Art movement|movement]] as such lasted only a few years, 1905–1908, and had three exhibitions.&lt;ref name=elderfield13&gt;[[John Elderfield]],  The ''"Wild Beasts" Fauvism and Its Affinities,'' 1976, [[Museum of Modern Art]], p.13, {{ISBN|0-87070-638-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Judi, et al., ''The Fauve Landscape'', 1990, Abbeville Press, p. 13, {{ISBN|1-55859-025-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of the movement were [[André Derain]] and [[Henri Matisse]].

==Artists and style==

Besides Matisse and [[André Derain|Derain]], other artists included [[Albert Marquet]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Louis Valtat]], [[Jean Puy]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Henri Manguin]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Kees van Dongen]] and [[Georges Braque]] (subsequently Picasso's partner in [[Cubism]]).&lt;ref name=elderfield13/&gt;

Fauvism has been compared to [[Expressionism]], both in its use of pure color and unconstrained brushwork.&lt;ref name=tate-fauvism/&gt; Some of the Fauves were among the first avant-garde artists to collect and study African and Oceanic art, alongside other forms of non-Western and folk art, leading several Fauves toward the development [[Cubism]].&lt;ref&gt;Joshua I.

==Origins==
[[File:Derain CharingCrossBridge.png|thumb|[[André Derain]], 1906, ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'', [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, DC.]]
[[Gustave Moreau]] was the movement's inspirational teacher;&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Freeman, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; a controversial professor at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris and a [[Symbolist painters|Symbolist painter]], he taught Matisse, Marquet, Manguin, Rouault and Camoin during the 1890s, and was viewed by critics as the group's philosophical leader until Matisse was recognized as such in 1904.&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt; Moreau's broad-mindedness, originality and affirmation of the expressive potency of pure color was inspirational for his students.&lt;ref name=dempsey&gt;Dempsey, Amy (2002). ''Styles, Schools and Movements: An Encyclopedic Guide to Modern Art'', pp. 66-69, London: Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Matisse said of him, "He did not set us on the right roads, but off the roads.  He disturbed our complacency."&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt; This source of empathy was taken away with Moreau's death in 1898, but the artists discovered other catalysts for their development.&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt;

In 1896, Matisse, then an unknown art student, visited the artist [[John Russell (Australian artist)|John Russell]] on the island of [[Belle Île]] off the coast of [[Brittany]].&lt;ref name=abc&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/booktalk/stories/s1430343.htm "Book talk: The Unknown Matisse..."], [[Radio National|ABC Radio National]], interview with [[Hilary Spurling]], 8 June 2005. Retrieved 1 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell was an [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painter; Matisse had never previously seen an Impressionist work directly, and was so shocked at the style that he left after ten days, saying, "I couldn't stand it any more."&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; The next year he returned as Russell's student and abandoned his earth-colored palette for bright Impressionist colors, later stating, "Russell was my teacher, and Russell explained color theory to me."&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; Russell had been a close friend of [[Vincent van Gogh]] and gave Matisse a Van Gogh drawing.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;

In 1901, [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] encountered the work of [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]] for the first time at an exhibition, declaring soon after that he loved Van Gogh more than his own father; he started to work by squeezing paint directly onto the canvas from the tube.&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt; In parallel with the artists' discovery of contemporary avant-garde art came an appreciation of pre-[[Renaissance]] French art, which was shown in a 1904 exhibition, ''French Primitives''.&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt; Another aesthetic influence was African sculpture, of which [[Vlaminck]], [[Derain]] and Matisse were early collectors.&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt;

Many of the Fauve characteristics first cohered in [[Matisse]]'s painting, ''[[Luxe, Calme et Volupté]]'' ("Luxury, Calm and Pleasure"), which he painted in the summer of 1904, whilst in [[Saint-Tropez]] with [[Paul Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross]].&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt;

After viewing the boldly colored canvases of [[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]], [[Albert Marquet]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Kees van Dongen]], [[Charles Camoin]], and [[Jean Puy]] at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1905, the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] disparaged the painters as "''fauves''" (wild beasts), thus giving their movement the name by which it became known, ''Fauvism''. The artists shared their first exhibition at the 1905 Salon d'Automne. The group gained their name after [[Louis Vauxcelles|Vauxcelles]] described their show of work with the phrase "[[Donatello]] chez les fauves" ("Donatello among the wild beasts"), contrasting their "orgie of tones" with a [[Renaissance]]-style sculpture that shared the room with them.&lt;ref name="Gil Blas, 17 October 1905"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7522165g/f5.image Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon d'Automne'', Gil Blas, 17 October 1905.

Following the Salon d'Automne of 1905 which marked the beginning of Fauvism, the Salon des Indépendants of 1906 marked the first time all the Fauves would exhibit together.

'''''Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything''''' is the debut non-fiction book by [[University of Chicago]] economist [[Steven Levitt]] and ''[[New York Times]]'' journalist [[Stephen J. Dubner]]. It was published on April 12, 2005, by [[William Morrow and Company|William Morrow]]. The book has been described as melding&lt;!--sic - please do not change the spelling unless you have read the cited source and have a sufficient command of the English language--&gt; [[popular culture|pop culture]] with [[economics]].{{r|deahl}} By late 2009, the book had sold over 4 million copies worldwide.{{r|fox}}

==Overview==
The book is a collection of articles written by Levitt, an expert who had gained a reputation for applying economic theory to diverse subjects not usually covered by "traditional" economists. In ''Freakonomics'', Levitt and Dubner argue that economics is, at root, the study of [[incentive]]s. The book's chapters cover:
* Chapter 1: Discovering [[cheating]] as applied to [[teacher]]s and [[sumo]] wrestlers, as well as a typical [[Washington DC]] area [[bagel]] business and its customers
* Chapter 2: Information control as applied to the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and [[real-estate]] agents
* Chapter 3: The economics of [[drug dealing]], including the surprisingly [[minimum wage|low earnings]] and abject working conditions of [[crack cocaine]] dealers
* Chapter 4: [[Legalized abortion and crime effect|The role legalized abortion has played in reducing crime]], contrasted with the policies and downfall of [[Romania]]n dictator [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] (Levitt explored this topic in an earlier paper entitled "[[The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime]]," written with [[John J. Donohue III|John Donohue]].)
* Chapter 5: The negligible effects of good [[parenting]] on [[education]]
* Chapter 6: The socioeconomic patterns of naming children ([[nominative determinism]])

One example of the authors' use of economic theory involves demonstrating the existence of cheating among sumo wrestlers. In a sumo tournament, all wrestlers in the top division compete in 15 matches and face demotion if they do not win at least eight of them. The sumo community is very close-knit, and the wrestlers at the top levels tend to know each other well. The authors looked at the final match, and considered the case of a wrestler with seven wins, seven losses, and one fight to go, fighting against an 8-6 wrestler. Statistically, the 7-7 wrestler should have a slightly below even chance, since the 8-6 wrestler is slightly better. However, the 7-7 wrestler actually wins around 80% of the time. Levitt uses this statistic and other data gleaned from sumo wrestling matches, along with the effect that allegations of corruption have on match results, to conclude that those who already have 8 wins [[collusion|collude]] with those who are 7-7 and let them win, since they have already secured their position for the following tournament. Despite condemnation of the claims by the [[Japan Sumo Association]] following the book's publication in 2005, the 2011 Grand Tournament in [[Tokyo]] was cancelled for the first time since 1946 because of allegations of match fixing.{{r|bbc_sumo}}

The authors attempt to demonstrate the power of [[data mining]], as a number of their results emerge from Levitt's analysis of various databases. The authors posit that various incentives encourage teachers to cheat by assisting their students with multiple-choice [[high-stakes testing|high-stakes tests]]. Such cheating in the [[Chicago]] school system is inferred from detailed analysis of students' answers to multiple choice questions. Levitt asks, "What would the pattern of answers look like if the teacher cheated?", and hypothesises that the more difficult questions found at the end of test sections will be answered correctly more frequently than the easy questions at the beginning of test sections.

===Reappraisals===
In Chapter 2 of ''Freakonomics'', the authors wrote of their visit to folklorist [[Stetson Kennedy]]'s Florida home where the topic of Kennedy's investigations of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] were discussed. However, in their January 8, 2006, column in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', Dubner and Levitt wrote of questions about Stetson Kennedy's research ("Hoodwinked", pp.&amp;nbsp;26–28) leading to the conclusion that Kennedy's research was at times embellished for effectiveness.

In the "Revised and Expanded Edition" this embellishment was noted and corrected: 
"Several months after ''Freakonomics'' was first published, it was brought to our attention that this man's portrayal of his crusade, and various other Klan matters, was considerably overstated&amp;nbsp;... we felt it was important to set straight the historical record."{{r|freakonomics_xiv}}

==Criticism==
''Freakonomics'' has been criticized for being a work of [[sociology]] or [[criminology]], rather than economics. Israeli economist [[Ariel Rubinstein]] criticized the book for making use of dubious statistics and complained that "economists like Levitt ... have swaggered off into other fields", saying that the "connection to economics ... [is] none" and that the book is an example of "[[Economic imperialism (economics)|academic imperialism]]".{{r|rubinstein}} [[Arnold Kling]] has suggested the book is an example of "amateur sociology".{{r|kling}}

===The impact of legalized abortion on crime===
{{further|Legalized abortion and crime effect}}

Revisiting a question first studied empirically in the 1960s, Donohue and Levitt argue that the legalization of abortion can account for almost half of the reduction in crime witnessed in the 1990s.  This paper has sparked much controversy, to which Levitt has said
:"The numbers we're talking about, in terms of crime, are absolutely trivial when you compare it to the broader debate on abortion. From a pro-life view of the world: If abortion is murder then we have a million murders a year through abortion. And the few thousand homicides that will be prevented according to our analysis are just nothing—they are a pebble in the ocean relative to the tragedy that is abortion. So, my own view, when we [did] the study and it hasn't changed is that: our study shouldn't change anybody's opinion about whether abortion should be legal and easily available or not. It's really a study about crime, not abortion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4583937 |title='Freakonomics': Musings of a 'Rogue Economist' : NPR |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Theodore Joyce argued that legalized abortion had little impact on crime, contradicting Donohue and Levitt's results ("Did Legalized Abortion Lower Crime?" Journal of Human Resources, 2003, 38(1), pp.&amp;nbsp;1 –37.). In 2004, the authors published a response,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=John J. Donohue III &amp; Stephen D. Levitt |publisher=The Journal of Human Resources |year=2004 |url=http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/DonohueLevittReply2004.pdf |title=Further Evidence that Legalized Abortion Lowered Crime: A Reply to Joyce |format=pdf |work= |accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they argued that Joyce's argument was flawed due to [[omitted-variable bias]].

In November 2005, [[Federal Reserve Bank of Boston]] economist Christopher Foote and his research assistant Christopher Goetz published a working paper,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |author=Christopher L. Foote &amp; Christopher F. Goetz |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Boston |date=2008-01-31 |url=http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/wp/wp2005/wp0515.pdf |title=The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime: Comment |format=pdf |work= |accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they argued that the results in Donohue and Levitt's abortion and crime paper were due to statistical errors made by the authors: the omission of state-year interactions and the use of the total number of arrests instead of the arrest rate in explaining changes in the murder rate. When the corrections were made, Foote and Goetz argued that abortion actually increased violent crime instead of decreasing it and did not affect property crime. They even concluded that the majority of women who had abortions in the 1970s were [[middle class]] [[White Americans|whites]] rather than [[Poverty|low income]] minorities as Levitt stated; this was, they stated, because white middle class women had the financial means for an abortion. ''[[The Economist]]'' remarked on the news of the errors that "for someone of Mr Levitt's iconoclasm and ingenuity, technical ineptitude is a much graver charge than moral turpitude. To be politically incorrect is one thing; to be simply incorrect quite another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=The Economist |url=http://www.economist.com/finance/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=5246700 |title=Abortion, Crime, and Econometrics |date=2005-12-01 |work= |accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, Donohue and Levitt published a response,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=John J. Donohue III &amp; Stephen D. Levitt |publisher= |date=January 2006 |url=http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/ResponseToFooteGoetz2006.pdf |title=Measurement Error, Legalized Abortion, the Decline in Crime: A Response to Foote and Goetz |format=pdf |work= |accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they admitted the errors in their original paper but also pointed out Foote and Goetz's correction was flawed due to heavy attenuation bias. The authors argued that, after making necessary changes to fix the original errors, the corrected link between abortion and crime was now weaker but still statistically significant, contrary to Foote and Goetz's claims. Foote and Goetz, however, soon produced a rebuttal of their own and said that even after analyzing the data using the methods that Levitt and Donohue recommend, the data does not show a positive correlation between abortion rates and crime rates.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; They are quick to point out that this does not necessarily disprove Levitt's thesis, however, and emphasize that with data this messy and incomplete, it is in all likelihood not even possible to prove or disprove Donohue and Levitt's conclusion.

''Freakonomics'' commented on the effects of an [[Abortion in Romania|abortion ban in Romania]] ([[Decree 770]]), stating that "Compared to Romanian children born just a year earlier, the cohort of children born after the abortion ban would do worse in every measurable way: they would test lower in school, they would have less success in the labor market, and they would also prove much more likely to become criminals. (p. 118)". John DiNardo, a professor at the [[University of Michigan]], retorts that the paper cited by ''Freakonomics'' states "virtually the opposite of what is actually claimed":
{{quote|source=Freakonomics: Scholarship in the Service of Storytelling{{r|jdinardo0}}|On average, children born in 1967 just after abortions became illegal display better educational and labor market achievements than children born  prior to the change. This outcome can be explained by a change in the composition of women having children: urban, educated women were more likely to have abortions prior to the policy change, so a higher proportion of children were born into urban, educated households. (Pop-Eleches, 2002, p.34).|John DiNardo}}

Levitt responded on the ''Freakonomics'' Blog that ''Freakonomics'' and Pop-Eleches "are saying the same thing":
{{quote|Here is the abstract of the version of the Pop-Eleches paper that we cited:

{{quote|…Children born after the abortion ban attained more years of schooling and greater labor market success. This is because urban, educated women were more likely to have abortions prior to the policy change, and the relative number of children born to this type of woman increased after the ban. However, controlling for composition using observable background variables, children born after the ban on abortions had worse educational and labor market achievements as adults. Additionally, I provide evidence of crowding in the school system and some suggestive evidence that cohorts born after the introduction of the abortion ban had higher infant mortality and increased criminal behavior later in life.}}

The introduction of the Pop-Eleches paper says:

{{quote|This finding is consistent with the view that children who were unwanted during pregnancy had worse socio-economic outcomes once they became adults.}}}}

===Effects of extra police on crime===
''Freakonomics'' claimed that it was possible to "tease out" the effect of extra police on crime by analysing electoral cycles. The evidence behind these claims was shown to be due partly to a programming error. McCrary stated "While municipal police force size does appear to vary over state and local electoral cycles ... elections do not induce enough variation in police hiring to generate informative estimates of the effect of police on crime."{{r|jdinardo0}}

===Defamation case===
On April 10, 2006, [[John Lott]] filed suit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.overlawyered.com/lott_complaint.pdf/Lott%20v%20Levitt.pdf|title=PDF of Lott's complaint v. Levitt|author=|date=|website=overlawyered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[defamation]] against Steven Levitt and [[HarperCollins Publishers]] over the book and against Levitt over a series of emails to retired economist [[John B. McCall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Parker Argues in Defamation Lawsuit - George Mason Law|url = http://www.law.gmu.edu/news/2008/parker_arguments|website = www.law.gmu.edu|accessdate = 2015-08-10|first = George Mason|last = Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''Freakonomics'', Levitt and coauthor [[Stephen J. Dubner]] claimed that the results of Lott's research in ''[[More Guns, Less Crime]]'' had not been replicated by other academics. In the emails to McCall, who had pointed to a number of papers in different academic publications that had replicated Lott's work, Levitt wrote that the work by authors supporting Lott in a special 2001 issue of ''[[The Journal of Law and Economics]]'' had not been peer reviewed, alleged that Lott had paid the University of Chicago Press to publish the papers, and that papers with results opposite of Lott's had been blocked from publication in that issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Michael |last=Higgins |title=Best-seller leads scholar to file lawsuit; Defamation allegation targets U. of C. author |publisher=Chicago Tribune |page=3 |date=2006-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A federal judge found that Levitt's replication claim in ''Freakonomics'' was not defamation but found merit in Lott's complaint over the email claims.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://johnrlott.tripod.com/2007/01/judge-castillo-issues-decision-on-lott.html Judge Castillo issues decision on Lott v. Levitt]" on John Lott's website&lt;/ref&gt;

Levitt settled the second defamation claim by admitting in a letter to John B. McCall that he himself was a peer reviewer in the 2001 issue of ''The Journal of Law and Economics'', that Lott had not engaged in bribery (paying for extra costs of printing and postage for a conference issue is customary), and that he knew that "scholars with varying opinions" (including Levitt himself) had been invited to participate.&lt;ref name="settlement"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glenn |first=David |date=2007-08-10 |journal=Chronicle of Higher Education |title=Dueling Economists Reach Settlement in Defamation Lawsuit |volume=53|page=10| url=http://chronicle.com/article/Dueling-Economists-Reach/6720 |issue=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CHD200707"/&gt; The ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' characterized Levitt's letter as offering "a [[doozy]] of a concession".&lt;ref name="CHD200707"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Unusual-Agreement-Means/39297|title=Unusual Agreement Means Settlement May Be Near in 'Lott v.

The dismissal of the first half of Lott's suit was unanimously upheld by [[The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] on February 11, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/fdocs/docs.fwx?submit=rss_sho&amp;shofile=07-3095_022.pdf 7th Circuit Affirmation of District Court Dismissal of Defamation Lawsuit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216142918/http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/fdocs/docs.fwx?submit=rss_sho&amp;shofile=07-3095_022.pdf |date=2009-02-16 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing history==
''Freakonomics'' peaked at number two among [[nonfiction]] on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] and was named the 2006 [[Book Sense]] Book of the Year in the Adult Nonfiction category. The book received positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator [[Metacritic]] reported the book had an average score of 67 out of 100, based on 16 reviews.{{r|metacritic}}''Freakonomics'' has a social review score 69/100 on Panjury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.panjury.com/trials/freakonomics|title=Freakonomics - Panjury, A Social Review Site|work=panjury.com|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Freakonomics Blog Screen Capture.jpg|thumb|right|Screen shot of Freakonomics Blog]]

The success of the book has been partly attributed to the [[blogosphere]]. In the campaign prior to the release of the book in April 2005, publisher ([[William Morrow and Company]]) chose to target bloggers in an unusually strategical way, sending galley copies to over a hundred of them, as well as contracting two specialized [[buzz marketing]] agencies.{{r|deahl}}

In 2006, the ''Revised and Expanded Edition'' of the book was published, with the most significant corrections in the second chapter.{{r|dubner}}

==Restrictions on distribution==
The book has been banned from Texas prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/02/texas-prisons-ban-books-mein-kampf-color-purple|title=Texas prisons ban The Color Purple and Monty Python – but Mein Kampf is fine|first=Edward|last=Helmore|date=2 December 2017|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris]],{{r|blog_author_morris}} [[Sudhir Venkatesh]],{{r|blog_author_venkatesh}} [[Justin Wolfers]]{{r|blog_author_wolfers}} and others.

In 2008, Stephen Dubner asked for questions from the site's readers and then featured them in an extended Q&amp;A on "Best Places to Live" with demographics expert [[Bert Sperling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dubner|first=Stephen|title=Bert Sperling Answers Your "Best Places  to Live" Questions|url=http://www.freakonomics.com/2008/10/14/bert-sperling-answers-your-best-places-to-live-questions/|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''SuperFreakonomics''==
{{main|SuperFreakonomics}}
In April 2007, co-author Stephen Dubner announced that there would be a sequel to ''Freakonomics'', and that it would contain further writings about street gang culture from [[Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh|Sudhir Venkatesh]], as well as a study of the use of money by [[capuchin monkey]]s.{{r|cnet_2007}} Dubner said the title would be ''[[SuperFreakonomics]]'',{{r|super}} and that one topic would be what makes people good at what they do.{{r|nyt_2009}} The book was released in Europe in early October 2009 and in the United States on October 20, 2009.

==Freakonomics radio==
{{main|Freakonomics radio}}
In September 2010, [[Marketplace (radio program)|Marketplace radio]] announced the creation of a Freakonomics podcast hosted by Dubner and Levitt. It is available on [[iTunes]] and is aired bi-weekly on [[NPR]].

==Film adaptation==
{{main|Freakonomics (film)}}
In 2010, [[Chad Troutwine]], Chris Romano, and Dan O'Meara produced a [[documentary film]] [[Freakonomics (film)|adaptation]] with a budget of nearly [[United States dollar|US]]$3 million in an [[Anthology|omnibus]] format by directors [[Seth Gordon]], [[Morgan Spurlock]], [[Alex Gibney]], [[Eugene Jarecki]], [[Rachel Grady]], and [[Heidi Ewing]].{{r|imdb}} It was the Closing Night Gala premiere film at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] on April 30, 2010.{{r|kohn}} It was also the Opening Night film at the AFI/Discovery [[SilverDocs]] film festival on June 21, 2010. [[Magnolia Pictures]] acquired distribution rights for a Fall 2010 release.{{r|newsinfilm_2010}}

''Freakonomics: The Movie'' was released in major cities with a [[pay what you want]] pricing offer for selected preview showings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/pay-what-you-want-to-see-freakonomics-the-movie,45265/|title=Pay what you want to see Freakonomics: The Movie}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No report of the results has yet been published.

==Freakonomics Consulting Group==
In 2009, Steven Levitt co-founded Freakonomics Consulting Group, a business and philanthropy consulting company which became The Greatest Good and is now known as TGG Group. Founding partners include Nobel laureates [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Gary Becker]], as well as several other prominent economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatestgood.com|title=The Greatest Good - Consulting|accessdate=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12867">'''Gender inequality in curricula''' exposes indications that female and male learners are not treated equally in various types of [[Curriculum|curricula]]. There are two types of curricula: formal and informal. Formal curricula are introduced by a government or an educational institution. Moreover they are defined as sets of objectives, content, resources and assessment. Informal curricula, also defined as [[Hidden curriculum|hidden]] or unofficial, refer to attitudes, values, beliefs, assumptions, behaviours and undeclared agendas underlying the learning process. These are formulated by individuals, families, societies, religions, cultures and traditions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002316/231646e.pdf|title=A Guide for Gender Equality in Teacher Education Policy and Practices|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100069-0|location=|pages=9–10, 59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More particularly, [[gender inequality]] is apparent in the curriculum of both schools and Teacher Education Institutes (TEIs). [[Physical education]] (PE) is particularly delicate, as gender equality issues coming from preconceived [[Gender stereotyping|stereotyping]] of boys and girls often arise. It is often believed that  boys are better at physical exercise than girls and that these are better at 'home' activities including sewing and cooking. This belief prevails in many cultures around the world and is not bound to one culture only.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Curriculum language and gender ==
Some curricular objectives show that the language used is gender biased. Indeed, it can happen that the language itself can communicate the status of being male or female, and the status of being assertive or submissive. In many cultures, 'being male' is expressed in language as being confident. In Japan, according to Pavlenko,&lt;ref&gt;Norton, B. &amp; Toohey, K. (eds). 2004. ''Critical Pedagogies and Language Learning''. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; female Japanese learners are led 'to see English as a language of empowerment. The students state that ... the pronoun system of English allow[s] them to position and express themselves differently as more independent individuals than when speaking Japanese.' This example clearly shows how languages, reflecting cultures, are the basis for introducing gender inequalities highlighting the curricula.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Curriculum structure and gender ==
Many Teacher Education Institutes (TEIs) around the world, which set curricula, i.e. teaching diplomas, show a worrying shortcoming regarding issues of gender equality. For instance, students who prove being prepared to become schoolteachers are taught on education theories, the [[psychology of learning]], teaching methodologies and class management, among others and one or two practical courses. There is no highlight on gender equality-related issues in their training.  Even courses on curriculum design ignore these issues. This omission is highly problematic and should be addressed by curriculum designers of TEIs. It is important that gender equality issues are part of the curriculum in order to help future teachers to be more sensitive about gender equality issues. Thus when they become teachers, they can become agents of change in their schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Content of instructional materials and gender ==
Teachers often use materials, including texts, images or examples that reinforce stereotyped roles. Typical examples given include, roles of the father (reading the newspaper) and the mother (serving dinner); the doctor (male) and the nurse (female); playing ball (boy) and combing doll's hair (girl). By doing this, teachers are also promoting gender bias which favors girls as well. For instance, bullying and noise-making for boys and politeness and gentleness for girls. Gender bias does not only favor males over females; it can also go the other way around. They are both negative when considering a healthy relationship between the teacher and the learner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== A gender equal curriculum ==
A gender equal curriculum shows the diversity of society when increasing examples that highlight successful female characters in texts as well as in the examples used during classes. Instructional materials, including textbooks, handouts or workbooks, should be studies to determine whether they are gender biased, gender neutral or gender-sensitive/responsive. In Teacher Education Institutes (TEIs), curricula need to include elements that recognize gender equality-related issues in learning materials, and how those issues can be faced by teachers once they take up the profession and start to use these materials in their classes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Quality curriculum should include gender equality as a result of teaching and learning in TEIs, as well as in schools. Educational systems that adopt gender equality aspects are able to: 
* Revise its curriculum framework to explicitly state commitment to gender equality.
* Emphasize attitudes and values that promote gender equality.
* Ensure that the content of the course syllabus includes values and attitudes of gender equality. y Revise textbooks and learning materials to become gender-sensitive.
* Remove gender-based stereotypes that contribute towards perpetuating gender inequalities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Approaches in preventing gender inequality and school-related gender-based violence ==

It is possible to integrate [[school-related gender-based violence (SRGBV)]] prevention into the curriculum for children of all school-going ages. Topics include [[Comprehensive sex education|comprehensive sexuality education]] (CSE), life skills education, [[Civics|civics education]] and targeted approaches on managing aggression, developing bystander skills, forming healthy relationships and protection from [[bullying]] – these elements are often combined.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002466/246651E.pdf|title=Global guidance on addressing school-related gender-based violence|last=UNESCO and UN Women|first=|publisher=UNESCO and UN Women|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100191-8|location=61-62|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===

==== The World Starts with Me, Uganda ====

In 2002, two Dutch NGOs including the [[World Population Foundation]] and Butterfly Works, created The World Starts with me. Aimed at students aged 12 – 19 years old, it is a low-tech, online, interactive sex education programme. The programme uses David and Rose, two virtual peer educators who guide students through fourteen lessons around self-esteem, healthy relationships, sexual development, safer sex, gender equality and sexual rights. Each lesson includes an assignment-type lesson, for instance creating a storyboard, an art work or conducting a role play on the topic of that lesson. Evaluation of the programme (with the use of a quasi-experimental design) showed a significant positive effects on non-coercive sex within students in intervention groups. Indeed, they reported having more confidence in their ability to deal with situations where sexual pressure and force would be used.&lt;ref&gt;Rijsdijk, Liesbeth et al. 2011. The World Starts With Me: A multilevel evaluation of a comprehensive sex education programme targeting adolescents in Uganda. BMC Public Health, Vol. 11, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==== Programs H and M, Brazil ====

Named after the Spanish and Portuguese words for men and women (hombres in Sp., homes in Port., mujeres in Sp., mulheres in Port.), the programs H and M used an evidence-based curriculum and included a group of educational activities which were designed to be carried out in same-sex group settings, as well as by same-sex facilitators of the groups, who can eventually be consider as gender-equitable role models.&lt;ref&gt;Care International. 2012. ''The Young Men Initiative: Engaging young men in the Western Balkans in gender equality and violence prevention: A Case Study''. Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Care International.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The manuals used by these programmes include activities on fatherhood/motherhood and caregiving, violence prevention, sexual and reproductive health including HIV/AIDS and other related issues. The activities of the programme included brainstorming role-playing and other exercises which contributed to students reflecting on how boys and girls socialized and the pros and cons of this socialization and to explore the benefits of changing certain behaviours.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The programme was evaluated in several locations through mostly quasi-experimental studies. It showed evidence of positive changes in participants' gender-equitable attitudes and behaviours and showed reduced gender-based violence.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo, C., Nascimento, M., Fonseca, V. and Segundo, M. 2010. ''Program H and Program M: Engaging young men and empowering young women to promote gender equality and health''. Washington, DC, PAHO/Best Practices in Gender and Health.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==== Fourth R, Canada ====

This programme is based on the belief that relationship knowledge and skills can and should be taught in the same way as reading, writing and arithmetic, which gives the program its name. The programme is taught with children of grades 8 - 12.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Thanks to a five-year randomized control trial of the classes with Grade 9 students (aged between 14 and 15), it was found that when comparing, students who received standard health classes students (especially boys) who received the Fourth R used significantly fewer acts of violence towards a dating partner by the end of Grade 11.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, D., Crooks, C., Jaffe, P., Chiodo, D., Hughes, R., Ellis, W., Stitt, L. and Donner, A. 2009. A school- based program to prevent adolescent dating violence: a cluster randomised trial. ''Arch. Pediatr. Adolesc. Med.'', Vol. 163, No. 8, pp. 692–699.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==== Second Step, United States ====

This Second Step program teaches skills such as communication, coping and decision-making with the objective to help young people navigate peer pressure, substance abuse and in person and online bullying. The aforementioned programme has been used with more than 8 million students in over 32,000 American schools.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A two-year cluster-randomized clinical trial of Second Step was carried out with over 3,600 students at 36 middle schools in Grades 6 and 7 (aged 11–13 years) in Illinois and Kansas. At the end of the programme, the study found that, students in Illinois intervention schools were 39 per cent less likely to report sexual violence perpetration and 56 per cent less likely to self-report homophobic name-calling victimization than students in control schools. There was, however, no significant difference in the Kansas schools.&lt;ref&gt;Espelage, D., Basile, K. and Hamburger, M. 2012. Bullying Perpetration and Subsequent Sexual Violence Perpetration among Middle School Students. Journal of Adolescent Health, Vol. 50, No. 1, pp. 60–65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==== The Gender Equity Movement in Schools (GEMS), India ====

The GEMS project used extracurricular activities, role-playing and games. This project began in the sixth grade and worked for two years with boys and girls between the ages of 12–14 in public schools in Goa, Kota and Mumbai. In Goa and Kota, it was layered with ongoing school curriculum. In Mumbai, it was run as an independent pilot project in 45 schools.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

An evaluation study was implemented on the pilot which using a quasi-experimental design to assess the results of the programme on the students. Over the course of the programme, the study found that participating students were more supportive of girls pursuing higher education and marrying later in life, and of boys and men contributing to household tasks. However, an important component of GEMS, students' behaviours and attitudes around reducing violence prooved mixed results. The GEMS approach will now be carried out in up to 250 schools in Mumbai, following the success of the first pilot programme. It is also being rolled out in 20 schools in Viet Nam.&lt;ref&gt;ICRW. 2011. Building Support for Gender Equality among Adolescents in School: Findings from Mumbai, India. New Delhi, ICRW.

'''The Grand Master of Magic® Award''' is a lifetime achievement award presented by the Brotherhood of Auckland Magicians Incorporated on behalf of the magicians of New Zealand.  It was first awarded in 1969 and to date it has been awarded on eighteen occasions.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bam.net.nz/grand-masters-of-magic/|title=Brotherhood of Auckland Magicians : Grand Master of Magic Award information}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ibmring160"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibmring160.com/national-awards/grand-masters.aspx|title=Grand Master of Magic criteria}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geniimagazine.com/magicpedia/Edgar_Benyon|title=Benyon Biography, MagicPedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria for the Grand Master of Magic® ==

The criteria for the Grand Master of Magic Award was formalised in 1998 and is as follows :

"Its purpose is to honour those magicians who are acknowledged by their fellow magicians to be masters of the art and craft of [[Magic (illusion)|magic]].  The recipients first and foremost must be [[performers]] of a high standard.  In addition they might be originators of [[magic tricks|magical effects]], or administrators giving time and expertise to running societies and [[magic convention|conventions]].  They could be consistent competition winners, or have an international standing, or be known only in the [[New Zealand]] setting.  But above all they are people who have served magic well, have graced our art, and made a special contribution over many years."

Any nomination must also be measured against the standard achieved by the previous recipients.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibmring160" /&gt;

'''Göbekli Tepe''' ({{IPA-tr|ɟøbekˈli teˈpe|pron}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Göbekli Tepe |publisher=Forvo Pronunciation Dictionary |url=http://www.forvo.com/word/g%C3%B6bekli_tepe/}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Turkish language|Turkish]] for "Potbelly Hill",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|title=History in the Remaking|journal=Newsweek|date=18 Feb 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an archaeological site in the [[Southeastern Anatolia Region]] of [[Turkey]], approximately {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast of the city of [[Şanlıurfa]]. The [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] has a height of {{convert|15|m|0|abbr=on}} and is about {{convert|300|m|abbr=on}} in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Schmidt (2009): ''Göbekli Tepe - Eine Beschreibung der wichtigsten Befunde erstellt nach den Arbeiten der Grabungsteams der Jahre 1995-2007''. In: ''Erste Tempel - Frühe Siedlungen. 12000 Jahre Kunst und Kultur.'' Oldenburg, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; It is approximately {{convert|760|m|abbr=on}} above sea level.

The tell includes two phases of use believed to be of a social or ritual nature dating back to the 10th–8th millennium BCE. During the first phase, belonging to the [[pre-pottery Neolithic A|Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] (PPNA), circles of massive T-shaped stone pillars were erected – the world's oldest known [[megalith]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qR5TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47|title=The Archaeology of Malta|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107006690|page=47|language=en|last1=Sagona|first1=Claudia|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 200 pillars in about 20 circles are currently known through [[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|geophysical surveys]]. Each pillar has a height of up to {{convert|6|m|0|abbr=on}} and weighs up to 10 tons. They are fitted into sockets that were hewn out of the [[bedrock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Curry |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/gobekli-tepe.html |date=November 2008 |publisher=Smithsonian.com |title=Gobekli Tepe: The World’s First Temple? |accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second phase, belonging to the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] (PPNB), the erected pillars are smaller and stood in rectangular rooms with floors of polished [[Lime (material)|lime]]. The site was abandoned after the PPNB. Younger structures date to classical times.

The details of the structure's function remain a mystery. It was excavated by a German archaeological team under the direction of [[Klaus Schmidt (archaeologist)|Klaus Schmidt]] from 1996 until his death in 2014. Schmidt believed that the site was a [[sanctuary]] where people from a wide region periodically congregated, not a settlement.

In 2018, the site was designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1572|title=Göbekli Tepe|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point attempts had been made to break up some of the pillars, presumably by farmers who mistook them for ordinary large rocks.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/30706129.html|title=Göbekli Tepe: The World’s First Temple?|last=Curry|first=Andrew|date=November 2008|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=2009-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, [[Klaus Schmidt (archaeologist)|Klaus Schmidt]] of the [[German Archaeological Institute]], who had previously been working at [[Nevalı Çori]], was looking for another site to excavate. He reviewed the archaeological literature on the surrounding area, found the 1963 Chicago researchers’ brief description of Göbekli Tepe, and decided to reexamine the site. Having found similar structures at Nevalı Çori, he recognized the possibility that the rocks and slabs were prehistoric. The following year, he began excavating there in collaboration with the [[Şanlıurfa Museum]], and soon unearthed the first of the huge T-shaped pillars.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt;

==Dating==
[[File:Göbekli Tepe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|View of site and excavation]]

The imposing [[stratigraphy]] of Göbekli Tepe attests to many centuries of activity, beginning at least as early as the [[Epipaleolithic (Levant)|Epipaleolithic]] period. Structures identified with the succeeding period, [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] (PPNA), have been dated to the 10th millennium BCE. Remains of smaller buildings identified as [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] (PPNB) and dating from the 9th millennium BCE have also been unearthed.

A number of [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]] have been published:

The Hd samples are from [[charcoal]] in the fill of the lowest levels of the site and would date the end of the active phase of occupation of Level III - the actual structures will be older. The Ua samples come from [[Pedogenesis|pedogenic]] [[carbonate]] coatings on pillars and only indicate the time after the site was abandoned—the ''[[terminus ante quem]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313082449/http://www.canew.org/uppermesop14cbox.html|title=The CANEW Project|author=|date=13 March 2009|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complex==
Göbekli Tepe is on a flat and barren [[plateau]], with buildings fanning in all directions. In the north, the plateau is connected to a neighbouring mountain range by a narrow [[promontory]]. In all other directions, the ridge descends steeply into slopes and steep cliffs.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Schmidt: ''Sie bauten die ersten Tempel. Das rätselhafte Heiligtum der Steinzeitjäger. Die archäologische Entdeckung am Göbekli Tepe.'' Munich 2006, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; On top of the ridge there is considerable evidence of human impact, in addition to the actual tell. Excavations have taken place at the southern slope of the tell, south and west of a [[mulberry]] that marks an Islamic pilgrimage,&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Schmidt: ''Göbekli Tepe. Eine Beschreibung der wichtigsten Befunde erstellt nach den Arbeiten der Grabungsteams der Jahre 1995-2007''. In: ''Erste Tempel - Frühe Siedlungen. 12000 Jahre Kunst und Kultur. Ausgrabungen und Forschungen zwischen Donau und Euphrat. Oldenburg 2009, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; but archaeological finds come from the entire plateau. The team has also found many remains of tools.

===Plateau===
[[File:Göbekli Tepe surrounding area.JPG|thumb|Göbekli Tepe surrounding area]]
[[File:Göbekli2012-20.jpg|thumb|Complex E]]
The plateau has been transformed by [[erosion]] and by [[quarry]]ing, which took place not only in the Neolithic, but also in classical times. There are four {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|20|cm|in|adj=mid|-wide}} channels on the southern part of the plateau, interpreted as the remains of an ancient quarry from which rectangular blocks were taken. These are possibly related to a square building in the neighbourhood, of which only the foundation is preserved. Presumably, this is the remains of a Roman [[watchtower]] which belonged to the [[Limes Arabicus]]. However, this is not known with certainty.&lt;ref name="Schmitt 2006, p. 105"&gt;Schmidt 2006, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Most structures on the plateau seem to be the result of Neolithic quarrying, with the quarries being used as sources for the huge, monolithic architectural elements. Their profiles were pecked into the rock, with the detached blocks then levered out of the rock bank.&lt;ref name="Schmitt 2006, p. 105"/&gt; Several quarries where round workpieces had been produced were identified. Their status as quarries was confirmed by the find of a 3-by-3-metre piece at the southeastern slope of the plateau. Unequivocally Neolithic are three T-shaped pillars that have not been levered out of the bedrock. The biggest of them lies on the northern plateau. It has a length of {{convert|7|m|0|abbr=on}} and its head has a width of {{convert|3|m|0|abbr=on}}. Its weight may be around 50 tons. The two other unfinished pillars lie on the southern Plateau.

At the western edge of the hill, a lion-like figure was found. In this area, [[flint]] and limestone fragments occur more frequently. It was therefore suggested that this could have been some kind of sculpture workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 2006, pp. 109-111&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear, on the other hand, how to classify three [[phallus|phallic]] depictions from the surface of the southern plateau. They are near the quarries from classical times, making their dating difficult.&lt;ref name=Schmidtp111&gt;Schmidt 2006, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the tell, there is an incised platform with two sockets that could have held pillars, and a surrounding flat bench. This platform corresponds to the complexes from Layer III at the actual tell. Continuing the naming pattern, it is called "complex E." Owing to its similarity to the cult-buildings at [[Nevalı Çori]] it has also been called "Temple of the Rock." Its floor has been carefully hewn out of the bedrock and smoothed, reminiscent of the [[terrazzo]] floors of the younger complexes at Göbekli Tepe. Immediately northwest of this area are two cistern-like pits, believed to be part of complex E. One of these pits has a table-high pin as well as a staircase with five steps.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 2006, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

At the western [[escarpment]], a small cave has been discovered in which a small [[relief]] depicting a bovine was found. It is the only relief found in this cave.&lt;ref name=Schmidtp111/&gt;

===Layer III===
[[File:Gobekli Tepe 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Pillar 2 from Enclosure A (Layer III) with [[low relief]]s of what are believed to be a [[bull]], [[fox]], and [[Crane (bird)|crane]].]]

At this early stage of the site's history, circular compounds or ''[[Temenos|temene]]'' first appear. They range from 10 to 30 metres in diameter. Their most notable feature is the presence of T-shaped limestone pillars evenly set within thick interior walls composed of unworked stone. Four such circular structures have been unearthed so far. Geophysical surveys indicate that there are 16 more, enclosing up to eight pillars each, amounting to nearly 200 pillars in all. The slabs were transported from bedrock pits located approximately 100 metres (330&amp;nbsp;ft) from the hilltop, with workers using flint points to cut through the limestone bedrock.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 2000b, pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GobeklitepeHeykel.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Pillar 27 from Enclosure C (Layer III) with the sculpture of a predatory animal]]
[[File:Göbekli Tepe Pillar.JPG|thumb|upright|Pillar with the sculpture of a fox]]
Two taller pillars stand facing one another at the centre of each circle. Whether the circles were provided with a roof is uncertain. Stone benches designed for sitting are found in the interior.&lt;ref&gt;Mithen 2004, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the pillars are decorated with [[Abstract art|abstract]], enigmatic [[pictogram]]s and [[sculpture|carved]] animal reliefs. The pictograms may represent commonly understood sacred symbols, as known from [[Neolithic]] [[cave paintings]] elsewhere. The reliefs depict mammals such as lions, bulls, boars, foxes, gazelles and donkeys; snakes and other reptiles, [[arthropod]]s such as insects and arachnids; and birds, particularly vultures. At the time the edifice was constructed, the surrounding country was likely to have been forested and capable of sustaining this variety of wildlife, before millennia of settlement and cultivation led to the near–[[Dust Bowl]] conditions prevalent today.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt; Vultures also feature prominently in the iconography of [[Çatalhöyük]] and [[Jericho]].

Few humanoid figures have appeared in the art at Göbekli Tepe. However, some of the T-shaped pillars have human arms carved on their lower half, suggesting to site excavator Schmidt that they are intended to represent the bodies of stylized humans (or perhaps gods). Loincloths also appear on the lower half of a few pillars. The horizontal stone slab on top is thought by Schmidt to symbolize shoulders, which means the figures were left headless.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 2010, pp. 244, 246&lt;/ref&gt; Whether they were intended to serve as surrogate worshippers, symbolize venerated ancestors, or represent supernatural, anthropomorphic beings is not known.

Some of the floors in this, the oldest, layer are made of [[terrazzo]] (burnt lime), others are bedrock from which pedestals to hold the large pair of central pillars were carved in high relief.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, 2010, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Radiocarbon dating places the construction of these early circles in the range of 9600 to 8800 BCE. Carbon dating suggests that (for reasons unknown) the enclosures were backfilled during the Stone Age.

===Layer II===
[[File:Şanlıurfa Müzesi Neotilik Çağ totem.jpg|thumb|A sort of [[totem pole]] from Göbekli Tepe, Layer II, 8800-8000 BCE - [[Sanliurfa Museum|Şanlıurfa (Urfa) Museum]]]]

Creation of the circular enclosures in layer III later gave way to the construction of small rectangular rooms in layer II. Rectangular buildings make a more efficient use of space compared with circular structures. They are often associated with the emergence of the Neolithic.&lt;ref&gt;Flannery and Marcus, ''The Creation of Inequality'', p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; But the T-shaped pillars, the main feature of the older enclosures, are also present here, indicating that the buildings of Layer II continued to serve as sanctuaries.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 2010, pp. 239, 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Layer II is assigned to [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] (PPNB). The several adjoining rectangular, doorless and windowless rooms have floors of polished lime reminiscent of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] terrazzo floors. Carbon dating has yielded dates between 8800 and 8000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 2009, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Several T-pillars up to 1.5 meters tall occupy the center of the rooms. A pair decorated with fierce-looking lions is responsible for the name "lion pillar building" by which their enclosure is known.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 1990, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

A sort of a stone totem pole was discovered at Göbekli Tepe, Layer II in 2010. It is 1.92 metres high, and is superficially reminiscent of those in North America. The pole features three figures, the uppermost depicting a predator, probably a bear, and below it a human-like shape. Because the statue is damaged, the interpretation is not entirely clear. Fragments of a similar pole were discovered about 20 years ago in [[Nevalı Çori]], also in Turkey. Also, an older layer at Gobekli does feature some related sculptures portraying animals on human heads.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tepetelegrams.wordpress.com/2017/03/01/the-gobekli-tepe-totem-pole/ The Göbekli Tepe ‘Totem Pole’.] News &amp; Notes from the Göbekli Tepe Research Staff - 03/01/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Layer I===
Layer I is the uppermost part of the hill. It is the shallowest, but accounts for the longest stretch of time. It consists of loose sediments caused by erosion and the virtually uninterrupted use of the hill for agricultural purposes since it ceased to operate as a cult center.

The site was deliberately [[Earthworks (engineering)|backfilled]] sometime after 8000 BCE: the buildings were buried under debris, mostly flint gravel, stone tools, and animal bones.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 2010, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to [[Byblos]] points (weapon heads, i.e. arrowheads etc.) and numerous [[Nemrik]] points, [[Helwan]]-points and [[Tell Aswad|Aswad]]-points dominate the backfill's lithic inventory.

==Chronological context==
All statements about the site must be considered preliminary, as less than 5% of the site has been excavated, and Schmidt planned to leave much of it untouched to be explored by future generations when archaeological techniques will presumably have improved.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt; While the site formally belongs to the earliest Neolithic ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPNA]]), up to now no traces of domesticated plants or animals have been found. The inhabitants are assumed to have been [[hunters and gatherers]] who nevertheless lived in villages for at least part of the year.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian report 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; So far, very little evidence for [[residential]] use has been found. Through the [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]] method, the end of Layer III can be fixed at about 9000 BCE (see above) but it is believed{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} that the elevated location may have functioned as a spiritual center by 11,000 BCE or even earlier, essentially at the very end of the [[Pleistocene]].

The surviving structures, then, not only predate [[pottery]], [[metallurgy]], and the invention of [[writing]] or the [[wheel]], but were built before the so-called [[Neolithic Revolution]], i.e., the beginning of [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]] around 9000 BCE. But the construction of Göbekli Tepe implies organization of an advanced order not hitherto associated with [[Paleolithic]], [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPNA]], or [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B|PPNB]] societies. Archaeologists estimate that up to 500 persons were required to extract the heavy pillars from local [[quarry|quarries]] and move them {{convert|100|-|500|m|ft|-1|sp=us}} to the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Which came first, monumental building projects or farming? |work=Archaeo News |date= 14 December 2008 | url= http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/003061.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pillars weigh {{convert|10|-|20|MT|lk=out|0}}, with one still in the quarry weighing 50 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taracha|first=Piotr|title=Religions of second millennium Anatolia|year=2009|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-3-447-05885-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTE7o8aKI7IC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22G%C3%B6bekli+Tepe%22+%2250+tons%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the beginning of the 8th millennium BCE Göbekli Tepe lost its importance. The advent of agriculture and animal husbandry brought new realities to human life in the area, and the "Stone-age zoo" (Schmidt's phrase applied particularly to Layer III, Enclosure D) apparently lost whatever significance it had had for the region's older, foraging communities. But the complex was not simply abandoned and forgotten to be gradually destroyed by the elements. Instead, each enclosure was deliberately buried under as much as {{convert|300|to|500|m3|cuyd|-1|sp=us}} of refuse consisting mainly of small limestone fragments, stone vessels, and stone tools. Many animal, and even human, bones have also been identified in the fill.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 2010, pp. 242—243, 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Why the enclosures were buried is unknown, but it preserved them for posterity.

==Interpretation==
[[File:Klaus Schmidt Monumento 2014 5.jpg|thumb|rt|250px|Klaus Schmidt, 2014 in Salzburg]]
[[Klaus Schmidt (archaeologist)|Schmidt]]'s view was that Göbekli Tepe is a stone-age mountain sanctuary. [[Radiocarbon dating]] as well as comparative, stylistical analysis indicate that it is the oldest religious site yet discovered anywhere.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArchMag"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.archaeology.org/0811/abstracts/turkey.html| title=The World's First Temple| work= Archaeology magazine |date=Nov–Dec 2008 | page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmidt believed that what he called this "cathedral on a hill" was a pilgrimage destination attracting worshippers up to {{convert|150|km|abbr=on|-1}} distant. Butchered bones found in large numbers from local game such as deer, gazelle, pigs, and geese have been identified as refuse from food hunted and cooked or otherwise prepared for the congregants.&lt;ref&gt;Peters &amp; Schmidt 2004, 207&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmidt considered Göbekli Tepe a central location for a [[Veneration of the dead|cult of the dead]] and that the carved animals are there to protect the dead. Though no tombs or graves have been found so far, Schmidt believed that they remain to be discovered in niches located behind the sacred circles' walls.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt;

In 2017, discovery of human crania with incisions was reported, interpreted as providing evidence for a new form of Neolithic skull cult.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Gresky, Juliane Haelm and Lee Clare, "Modified human crania from Göbekli Tepe provide evidence for a new form of Neolithic skull cult", Science Advances, Vol. 3, no. 6, 28 Jun 2017. DOI:10.1126/sciadv.1700564 [http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/6/e1700564.full (full text)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmidt also interpreted it in connection with the initial stages of the [[Neolithic]].&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt; It is one of several sites in the vicinity of [[Karaca Dağ]], an area which [[genetics|geneticists]] suspect may have been the original source of at least some of our cultivated grains (see [[Einkorn]]). Recent DNA analysis of modern domesticated wheat compared with wild wheat has shown that its DNA is closest in sequence to wild wheat found on [[Karaca Dağ]] {{convert|30|km|-1|abbr=on}} away from the site, suggesting that this is where modern wheat was first domesticated.&lt;ref&gt;Heun et al., ''Site of Einkorn Wheat Domestication Identified by DNA Fingerprinting'', Science, 278 (1997) 1312–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

With its mountains catching the rain and a calcareous, porous bedrock creating lots of springs, creeks and rivers&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; the upper reaches of the Euphrates and Tigris was a refuge during the dry and cold [[Younger Dryas]] climatic event (10,800 – 9,500 BCE). Crowded conditions could have led these people to develop common rituals strengthened by monumental gathering places to reduce tensions and conflicts over resources&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tepetelegrams.wordpress.com/2017/06/01/cooperative-action-of-hunter-gatherers-in-the-early-neolithic-near-east-a-view-from-goebekli-tepe/|title=Cooperative Action of Hunter-Gatherers in the Early Neolithic Near East. A View from Göbekli Tepe|last=Oliver|first=Dietrich|date=June 1, 2017|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and probably to mark territorial claims.

Schmidt engaged in some speculation regarding the belief systems of the groups that created Göbekli Tepe, based on comparisons with other shrines and settlements. He assumed [[shamanism|shamanic]] practices and suggested that the T-shaped pillars represent human forms, perhaps [[ancestors]], whereas he saw a fully articulated belief in gods only developing later in [[Mesopotamia]], associated with extensive [[temple]]s and [[palace]]s. This corresponds well with an ancient [[Sumer]]ian belief that agriculture, animal husbandry, and weaving were brought to mankind from the sacred mountain [[Ekur]], which was inhabited by [[Annuna]] deities, very ancient gods without individual names. Schmidt identified this story as a primeval oriental myth that preserves a partial memory of the emerging Neolithic.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 2006, pp. 216–221&lt;/ref&gt; It is also apparent that the animal and other images give no indication of organized violence, i.e. there are no depictions of hunting raids or wounded animals, and the pillar carvings generally ignore game on which the society depended, such as deer, in favour of formidable creatures such as lions, snakes, spiders, and scorpions.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 2006, pp. 193–4; 218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peters &amp; Schmidt 2004, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding on Schmidt's interpretation that round enclosures could represent sanctuaries, Gheorghiu's semiotic interpretation reads Göbekli Tepe's iconography as a cosmogonic map which would have related the local community to the surrounding landscape and the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Dragos Gheorghiu (2015); ''A river runs through it. The semiotics of Gobekli Tepe's map (an exercise of archaeological imagination)'';  in Andrea Vianello (ed.), ''Rivers in Prehistory'', Oxford, Archaeopress&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
Göbekli Tepe is regarded by some as an archaeological discovery of the greatest importance since it could profoundly change the understanding of a crucial stage in the development of human society. [[Ian Hodder]] of Stanford University said, "Göbekli Tepe changes everything".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/turkey-archeological-dig-reshaping-human-history-75101|title=Turkey: Archeological Dig Reshaping Human History|author=|date=18 February 2010|website=newsweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; If indeed the site was built by [[hunter-gatherer]]s as some researchers believe then it would mean that the ability to erect monumental complexes was within the capacities of these sorts of groups which would overturn previous assumptions. Some researchers believe that the construction of Göbekli Tepe may have contributed to the later development of urban civilization. As excavator Klaus Schmidt put it: "First came the temple, then the city."&lt;ref&gt;K. Schmidt 2000: "Zuerst kam der Tempel, dann die Stadt."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:T-shaped-pillars-PPN.jpg|thumb|Sites with T-shaped pillars from the PPN]]
Not only its large dimensions, but the side-by-side existence of multiple pillar shrines makes the location unique. There are no comparable monumental complexes from its time. However, since its discovery surface surveys have shown that several hills in the greater area also have T-shaped stone pillars (e.g. Hamzan Tepe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://revije.ff.uni-lj.si/DocumentaPraehistorica/article/view/37.22/1714|title=Hamzan Tepe in the light of new finds|last=Çelik|first=Bahattin|date=2010|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Karahan Tepe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://revije.ff.uni-lj.si/DocumentaPraehistorica/article/view/38.19/1651|title=Karahan Tepe: a new cultural centre in the Urfa Area in Turkey|last=Çelik|first=Bahattin|date=2011|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Harbetsuvan Tepesi&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://revije.ff.uni-lj.si/DocumentaPraehistorica/article/view/43.21|title=A small-scale cult centre in Southeast Turkey: Harbetsuvan Tepesi|last=Çelik|first=Bahattin|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Sefer Tepe&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/14/1790/18894.pdf|title=New pre-pottery neolithic settlements from Viranşehir District|last=Güler, Çelik, Güler|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Taslı Tepe&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://revije.ff.uni-lj.si/DocumentaPraehistorica/article/view/40.23/817|title=New Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites and cult centres in the Urfa Region|last=Güler, Çelik, Güler|first=|date=2013|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but there has so far not been much excavation done. Most of these constructions seem to be smaller than Göbekli Tepe, and their placement evenly between contemporary settlements indicates that they were local social/ritual gathering places,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; with Göbekli Tepe maybe as a regional centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C-ysw2gdT9IC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=Urfa-Yeni+Yol&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LuggnTBH62&amp;sig=RM86IxQIvhOUu2jzyyaYHJbfQwc&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjsqNSCoPjVAhXEKJoKHd51CxoQ6AEIZjAN#v=onepage&amp;q=Urfa-Yeni%20Yol&amp;f=false|title=The Neolithic Revolution in the Near East: Transforming the Human Landscape|last=Simmons|first=Alan H.|date=|website=University of Arizona Press via Google Books|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; So far none of the smaller sites are as old as the lowest Level III of Göbekli Tepe,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; but contemporary with its younger Level II (mostly rectangular buildings, though  Harbetsuvan is circular). This could indicate that this type of architecture and associated activities originated at Göbekli Tepe and then spread to other sites.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

A 500 years younger site is [[Nevali Cori|Nevalı Çori]], a Neolithic settlement also excavated by the [[German Archaeological Institute]] and submerged by the [[Atatürk Dam]] since 1992. Its T-shaped pillars are considerably smaller, and its rectangular shrine was located inside a village. The roughly contemporary architecture at [[Jericho]] is devoid of artistic merit or large-scale sculpture, and [[Çatalhöyük]], perhaps the most famous Anatolian Neolithic village, is 2,000 years later.

At present Göbekli Tepe raises more questions for [[archaeology]] and [[prehistory]] than it answers. It remains unknown how a force large enough to construct, augment, and maintain such a substantial complex was mobilized and compensated or fed in the conditions of pre-sedentary society. Scholars cannot interpret the pictograms, and do not know for certain what meaning the animal reliefs had for visitors to the site; the variety of fauna depicted, from lions and boars to birds and insects, makes any single explanation problematic. As there is little or no evidence of habitation, and the animals pictured are mainly predators, the stones may have been intended to [[Apotropaic magic|stave off evils]] through some form of magic representation. Alternatively, they could have served as [[totem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Peters &amp; Schmidt 2004: pp. 209–212&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption that the site was strictly cultic in purpose and not inhabited has also been challenged by the suggestion that the structures served as large communal houses, "similar in some ways to the large plank houses of the Northwest Coast of North America with their impressive house posts and totem poles."&lt;ref&gt;Banning 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known why every few decades the existing pillars were buried to be replaced by new stones as part of a smaller, concentric ring inside the older one.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, June 2011, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Human burial may have occurred at the site. The reason the complex was carefully backfilled remains unexplained. Until more evidence is gathered, it is difficult to deduce anything certain about the originating culture or the site's significance.

Future plans include construction of a museum and converting the environs into an archaeological park in the hope that this will help preserve the site in the state in which it was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;K. Schmidt in Schmidt (ed.) 2009, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Global Heritage Fund]] (GHF) announced it will undertake a multi-year conservation program to preserve Göbekli Tepe. Partners include the [[German Archaeological Institute]], [[German Research Foundation]], [[Şanlıurfa]] Municipal Government, the Turkish Ministry of Tourism and Culture and, formerly, Klaus Schmidt.&lt;ref&gt;"GHF - Göbekli Tepe - Turkey", globalheritagefund.org, web: [http://globalheritagefund.org/what_we_do/preservation_by_design_partnerships/current_projects/gobekli_tepe_turkey GHF2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705232017/http://globalheritagefund.org/what_we_do/preservation_by_design_partnerships/current_projects/gobekli_tepe_turkey |date=5 July 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stated goals of the GHF Göbekli Tepe project are to support the preparation of a site management and conservation plan, construction of a shelter over the exposed archaeological features, training community members in guiding and conservation, and helping Turkish authorities secure UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] designation for GT.&lt;ref name="GHF"&gt;

   --&gt;_projects/gobekli_tepe_turkey GHF3].
&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservation work caused controversy in 2018, when Çiğdem Köksal Schmidt, an archaeologist and widow of Klaus Schmidt, said the site was being damaged by the use of concrete and "heavy equipment" during the construction of a new walkway. The [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism]] responded that no concrete was used and that no damage had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ahvalnews.com/turkey/concrete-poured-turkish-world-heritage-site|title=Concrete poured on Turkish World Heritage site|last=|first=|date=21 March 2018|work=Ahval|access-date=2018-03-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/construction-around-site-of-gobeklitepe-stirs-debate-129089|title=Construction around site of Göbeklitepe stirs debate|last=|first=|date=21 March 2018|website=Hürriyet Daily News|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute for Museum Research''' ({{lang-de|Institut für Museumsforschung (IfM)}}) is a national organization which provides services to museums in the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in the areas of research, application-oriented teaching and documentation. The Institute was founded in 1979 as a department of the [[Berlin State Museums]], overseen by the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]]. The Institute also operates the '''Center for Provenance Research''', tasked with the identification and proper return of [[Nazi plunder|looted art]] from [[Nazi Germany|the Nazi period]].

Additionally, the Institute assists regional museums in the German States. Research projects are carried out in cooperation with experts from relevant scientific disciplines in social sciences, education, engineering and natural sciences.

==Center for Provenance Research==

The '''Center for Provenance Research and Investigation''' ({{lang-de |Arbeitsstelle für Provenienzrecherche/-forschung  (AfP)}}) supports museums, libraries, archives and other publicly run institutions in the Federal Republic of Germany in the various processes of identifying [[cultural artifacts]] in their collections or in their possession which were [[Nazi plunder|looted]] from their lawful owners during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi period]]. The Office was established in 2007 as the direct result of findings issued by the working group on matters of restitution set up by the Minister of State for Culture, [[Bernd Neumann]] &lt;ref&gt;BKM press release 14.11.2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Provisions for the Office have been made possible through financial support from the Cultural Foundation of the German States ({{lang-de|Kulturstiftung der Länder}}). Funds totaling a million euros are assigned each year from the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media to support the investigation and study of the provenance of cultural artifacts. An Advisory Council made up of individuals from political and cultural institutions, as well as experts from the fields of history and art history, makes a significant contribution to the outcome of the decision as to which applicants are to receive restitution.

The Office also works closely with the [[Koordinierungsstelle für Kulturgutverluste]] (www.lostart.de) in publishing its findings and searching for the lawful owners of art works. It is also the aim of the Office to further ongoing ties between those individuals and institutions active in the field of provenance research and to encourage the sharing of information and research knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.smb.museum/smb/news/details.php?lang=de&amp;objID=17301 | title=Arbeitsstelle für Provenienzrecherche   |trans-title=| year=2008 | publisher=SMB | language=German | accessdate=2012-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014 the [[Cabinet of Germany|German Federal Government]] announced the reformation of the Koordinierungsstelle’s ''Lost Art Database'' into a new foundation called the ''Deutsches Zentrum Kulturgutverluste'' (English: “German Center for Lost Cultural Assets”), which will put the ''Lost Art Database'', the ''Arbeitsstelle für Provenienzforschung'' (English: “Center for Provenance Research”) in Berlin, the Taskforce of the Munich artworks discovery, and the Research Center for [[Degenerate Art]] of the [[Free University of Berlin]] under one roof. The stated goal of this reformation is to promote the active research and restitution of Nazi-looted cultural assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artlawreport.com/2014/10/09/germany-announces-center-for-cultural-property-losses-real-progress-or-window-dressing/ ''Art Law Report''], ''Germany announces “Center for Cultural Property Losses”: Real Progress or Window Dressing?'' by Nicholas O’Donnell, 9 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neues-deutschland.de/artikel/948518.neue-stiftung-forscht-nach-ns-raubkunst.html ''Neues Deutschland''], ''Neue Stiftung forscht nach NS-Raubkunst'' (in German), 8 October 2014 (English: “New Foundation researches Nazi-looted art”).&lt;/ref&gt; The general reception of this announcement in the press was skeptical, with the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|Frankfurter Allgemeine]]'', a major German daily newspaper, commenting: "It shouldn't be about creating new positions in a new place for officials who thus far haven't been doing their job.“&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/stiftung-zur-raubkunstaufklaerung-wann-gibt-es-endlich-resultate-13194854.html Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]'', ''Wann gibt es endlich Resultate?'' (in German) by Stefan Koldehoff (English: "When where there finally be results?") 9. October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joke theft''' is the act of performing and taking credit for comic material written by another person without their [[consent]]. This is a form of [[plagiarism]] and can, in some cases, be [[copyright infringement]]. 
==History==
===Vaudeville years===
In [[music hall]]s and [[vaudeville]], it was common for performers to "borrow" material. According to [[Milton Berle]], [[etiquette]] only required that "the borrower add to the joke and make it his own".&lt;ref name="Berle1989xxiii"&gt;Berle, Milton (1989) ''Private joke file'', ''Introduction'', p.xxiii quotation: {{quotation|Of course, in the days of vaudeville, it wasn't uncommon for a performer to "borrow" a joke from another performer. Etiquette demanded only that the borrower add to the joke and make it his own. Bert Williams, a star of the Ziegfeld Follies, pilfered a story about fish and added enough laughs to turn it into a classic fifteen-minute routine. Naturally, that routine happens to be in my file.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time there were few chances that a performer from one area would meet one from another and a single twenty-minute set could sustain a comic for a decade. Most jokes at the time were one-liners and there was little in the way of proof of a joke's origin, but the value of each joke was immeasurable to a comedian.&lt;ref name="radartake"&gt;{{cite web
  |url =http://www.radaronline.com/from-the-magazine/2007/02/take_the_funny_and_run_1.php 
  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217031356/http://www.radaronline.com/from-the-magazine/2007/02/take_the_funny_and_run_1.php

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Berle and [[Bob Hope]] had a long-standing feud due to Hope's accusation that Milton Berle had stolen some of his jokes.&lt;ref name="radartake" /&gt; Berle never disputed the claim, but instead embraced the title "The Thief of Bad Gag".

Even the most famous of comics have found themselves, knowingly or unknowingly, stealing material. [[Bill Cosby]] admitted to stealing a joke by George Carlin involving an uneducated football player doing a television commercial. Cosby said that what makes the routine his own is the surreal phrase "little tiny hairs".&lt;ref name="funny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-et-joketheft24jul24,1,6252669,full.story?coll=la-headlines-california&amp;ctrack=5&amp;cset=true |title=Funny, that was my joke |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=Welkos |first=Robert W. |date=2007-07-24 |accessdate=2009-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221013725/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-et-joketheft24jul24%2C1%2C6252669%2Cfull.story?coll=la-headlines-california&amp;ctrack=5&amp;cset=true |archivedate=21 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Cosby, Bill|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AikgyewBn8k|title=Late Show with David Letterman – Bill Cosby's Race Against George Carlin|publisher=[[CBS]]|medium=TV|date=2009-06-01|accessdate=2009-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many years later, [[Carlos Mencia]] performed a bit about athletes and their parents that hearkened back to a Cosby bit from his album ''[[Bill Cosby: Himself]]''.

===1970s===
In the 1970s, joke theft became more prominent with the boom in popularity of comedy. The 1980s and 1990s saw the popularity of [[stand-up comedy]] continue to increase. The advent of pay-cable networks afforded comics the opportunity to perform their routines unfettered. With this came a new type of joke theft in which the first comic to tell a stolen joke on some sort of media became the one associated with the joke.

[[Robin Williams]] was accused of stealing material from another comic. [[David Brenner]] claims that he confronted Williams personally and threatened him with bodily harm if he heard Williams utter another one of his jokes.&lt;ref name="Comedy at the Edge"&gt;{{cite book | title=Comedy at the Edge | author=Richard Zoglin | year=2008 | publisher=Bloomsbury USA | isbn=978-1582346243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
For many years, [[Denis Leary]] had been friends with fellow comedian [[Bill Hicks]]. However, when Hicks heard Leary's 1993 album ''No Cure For Cancer'', he felt Leary had stolen his act and material, and the friendship ended abruptly as a result.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook"&gt;{{cite book | title=Bill Hicks: Agent of Evolution | author=[[Kevin Booth]] and Michael Bertin | year=2005 | publisher=Harper Collins | isbn=0-00-719829-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole not just some of Hicks' material but his persona and attitude.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=44170  |title=Carlos Mencia is a weak minded joke thief | author=Joe Rogan | publisher=JoeRogan.net | year=2005 | accessdate=2006-10-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051218140900/http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=44170 |archivedate = 2005-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |title=Joe Rogan answers 20 Questions | last=Rogan | first=Joe | work=Playboy Magazine |date=October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hicksfaq"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320081614/http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html | title=Dark Times: Bill Hicks: Frequently Asked Questions | author=Tim McIntire | year=1998 | publisher=BillHicks.com | archivedate=2006-03-20 | accessdate=2006-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, it is claimed that after Hicks' death from [[pancreatic cancer]], an industry joke began to circulate about Leary's transformation and subsequent success (roughly; "Question: Why is Denis Leary a star while Bill Hicks is unknown? Answer: Because there's no cure for cancer").&lt;ref name="hicksfaq" /&gt;

In a 2008 appearance on ''The Opie and Anthony Show'', comedian [[Louis C.K.]] claimed that Leary stole his "I'm an asshole" routine, which was then expanded upon and turned into a hit song by Leary.&lt;ref name="Berle1989xxiii"/&gt; On a later episode of the same show, Leary challenged this assertion by claiming that he (Leary) co-wrote the song with Chris Phillips.&lt;ref name="radartake"/&gt;

In his memoir ''[[Gasping for Airtime]]'', [[Jay Mohr]] admitted that he lifted an entire routine from [[Rick Shapiro]]'s act for a 1995 ''Saturday Night Live'' sketch. He stated that Shapiro sued the show and was financially compensated, but Shapiro later disputed that he received any compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mohr|first1=Jay|title=Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live|date=2004|publisher=Hyperion Books|isbn=1401300065|pages=276–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s and 2010s===
Louis C.K. has maintained a relatively quiet rivalry with [[Dane Cook]] over three bits on Cook's album, ''Retaliation'', that allegedly bear some resemblance to three bits on C.K.'s album ''Live in Houston''.  C.K. and Cook portray this rivalry with comedy and sincerity in an episode of C.K.'s series ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thecomicscomic.com/2011/08/05/dane-cook-confronts-louis-ck-in-an-honest-way-about-joke-theft-read-the-transcript-watch-the-video/ | title = Dane Cook confronts Louis CK in an honest way about joke theft.

[[George Lopez]] has accused Carlos Mencia of plagiarizing his material and claimed that the two once had a physical altercation over the alleged plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.ucdadvocate.com/media/storage/paper538/news/2007/05/02/BonusBytes/Is.Carlos.Mencia.A.Thief-2891990.shtml |author=Goldyn, Debra |title=Is Carlos Mencia a thief? |work=Advocate |publisher=[[University of Colorado at Denver]] |date=2007-05-02 |accessdate=2007-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007092111/http://media.www.ucdadvocate.com/media/storage/paper538/news/2007/05/02/BonusBytes/Is.Carlos.Mencia.A.Thief-2891990.shtml |archivedate=7 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, fellow comedian Ted Sarnowski countered this claim and stated that it was he, not Lopez, who had originally penned the joke and that he had given Mencia permission to use it when he discovered that Lopez had stolen it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=5264&amp;IssueNum=199|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216161529/http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=5264&amp;IssueNum=199|archivedate=16 February 2008|author=Kozlowski, Carl|title=Carlos Mencia Just Said That|work=|publisher=Los Angeles CityBeat|date=2007-03-29|accessdate=2007-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Italian comic and satirist [[Daniele Luttazzi]] was accused by anonymous bloggers of having plagiarised many jokes from comedians such as [[George Carlin]], [[Mitch Hedberg]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Bill Hicks]] and [[Robert Schimmel]].&lt;ref name="rep_lut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli-e-cultura/2010/06/09/news/luttazzi-secopia-4703064/ |title=La Rete contro Luttazzi: "Copia" I dubbi dei fan, il tam-tam cresce – Repubblica.it |accessdate=2010-06-09 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.unita.it/media/Politica/Luttazzi_copia_Parte_1_1395.html |title=Luttazzi copia – Parte 1 |accessdate=2010-06-11 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612084318/http://video.unita.it/media/Politica/Luttazzi_copia_Parte_1_1395.html |archivedate=12 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a personal blog entry published five years prior, Luttazzi himself offered his blog readers a prize if they were able to identify a "nugget" (i.e. a reference to a famous joke), calling the game a "treasure hunt".&lt;ref name="blo_lut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://danieleluttazzi.blogspot.com/|title=Caccia al tesoro|author=Luttazzi, Daniele}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says he adds references to famous comedians' jokes to his work as a defense against the million-euro lawsuits he has to face because of his satire. (In March 2012, Luttazzi won a legal battle against [[La7]] broadcasting company, which in 2007 abruptly closed his late show "Decameron", accusing him, among other charges, of plagiarism from Bill Hicks. Sentence: It was original satire, not plagiarism. Luttazzi got 1 million 2 hundred thousand euros as compensation.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.corriere.it/spettacoli/12_marzo_10/satira-tv-luttazzi-vince-causa-contro-la-7-franco_69183226-6a83-11e1-8b63-010bde402ef9.shtml|title=Luttazzi vince la causa contro La7|date=10 March 2012|accessdate=10 March 2012|publisher=corriere.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; He calls this ruse "the [[Lenny Bruce]] trick" (named for the comic of same name).  Luttazzi asserts that the jokes he references are not "plagiarized" but "calqued", which is a fair use of original material. In 2014, an academic paper explained why Luttazzi's jokes are his own and not "plagiarised" ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caimotto|first1=M.Cristina|title=Transcreating a New Kind of Humor: the case of Daniele Luttazzi|url=http://www.cultusjournal.com/index.php/archive/16-issue-2014-v-7-transcreation-and-the-professions|website=cultusjournal.com|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, ''[[Australia's Got Talent]]'' contestant Jordan Paris presented an act of stand-up comedy and quickly proceeded to the semi-finals.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, G 2011, '[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/comedy/australias-got-plagiarism-ripoff-comic-exposed-20110526-1f50v.html Australia's Got Plagiarism: rip-off comic exposed]', ''Brisbane Times'' 26 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later revealed that he had plagiarised his jokes from comedians [[Lee Mack]] and [[Geoff Keith]]. The television network gave him a chance to redeem himself and allowed him to compete in the semi-finals using his own material. Paris' effort this time was self-deprecating, joking about his plagiarism and his large teeth. The first joke went well, but the rest went downhill. It was later found out that the joke that went well – "I just sacked my two writers – Copy and Paste" – had been done in 2009 by comedian [[Jeffrey Ross]], about [[Brad Garrett]], at a roast of [[Joan Rivers]]. Ross had said, "This guy has two writers, their names are Cut and Paste."&lt;ref&gt;Nancarrow, D 2011, [http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/oops-he-did-it-again-ripoff-comic-plunders-joke-about-plagiarism-20110629-1gq1d.html 'Oops.

In January 2012, blogger and comedian Troy Holm was ridiculed on the [[social networking]] site Facebook&lt;ref name="facebook1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/Occupy-Troy-Holm/217011661714006 |title=Occupy Troy Holm |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; for stealing jokes and stories from comedian [[Doug Stanhope]] and posting them to his blog from 2010, [[plagiarism|claiming them as his own work]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120701002315/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/working-hardprisondrug-war.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; including Stanhope's "Fuck someone uglier than you" routine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/fuck-someone-ugly.html |accessdate=3 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103154727/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/fuck-someone-ugly.html |archivedate=3 January 2012 |title=Fuck Someone Ugly|date=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was found on Stanhope's ''Acid Bootleg''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Doug+Stanhope/ACID+Bootleg |title=ACID Bootleg – Doug Stanhope – Listen and discover music at |publisher=Last.fm |date=2012-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Troy Holm also plagiarized Stanhope's story of an encounter with a transsexual prostitute&lt;ref&gt;[[Sicko (album)]]&lt;/ref&gt; nearly verbatim, substituting himself as Stanhope, and changing a few small details,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120701001921/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/06/hooker-story-and-dmt-story.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; causing a backlash from Stanhope's fans. This catapulted Troy Holm into an internet icon which started the "Occupy Troy Holm" Movement.&lt;ref name="facebook1"/&gt;  Stanhope commented on the Occupy Troy Holm Facebook page that "To the few people who seem to think this is overboard...and it is...I don't think that you know the levels to which this guy has been ripping me off. He didn't take a tit-fuck joke and use it as a status update. He's been living my entire life as though it was his, changing some names and then promoting with twitters... Look at his site and most the entirety of it is me, including the comments where he uses my stuff to pass as his own conversation. And on Twitter. So who is he ripping off for that stuff that ''isn't'' mine?"&lt;ref name="facebook1"/&gt;

==In other media==
Joke theft is not limited to stand-up comedy. Often jokes in film and television shows are taken from comics or even other media.
[[Dick Cavett]] wrote about joke theft in his autobiography. He'd written a bit about eating Chinese-German food and, an hour later, being hungry for power. After a few days of performing the bit, he discovered a column by [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]] which attributed the joke to [[Rip Taylor]]. However, after calling Taylor to ask him to stop using the bit, he discovered that not only had Taylor never performed the bit, he had never even heard it and laughed heartily at the joke's humor. It was then that Cavett discovered that some journalists often falsely attribute jokes to the wrong comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Cavett | author=Dick Cavett, Christopher Porterfield | year=1974| publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |pages=227–228| isbn=978-0151161300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavett and [[Woody Allen]] often cited to each other the many instances of their jokes appearing in television shows without their permission, sometimes even falsely attributed to each other. Allen's jokes, when he still lacked access to television, were regularly stolen by top mainstream shows ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' and ''[[Laugh In]]''.&lt;ref name="Cavett interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheckymagazine.com/cavett.htm |title=SHECKY! Interview: DICK CAVETT! |publisher=Sheckymagazine.com |accessdate=2012-07-11}} quotation: {{quotation|Woody's best lines would show up, while he was still confined to little Village clubs, on the Red Skelton show and that alleged entertainment, Laugh-In.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved extremely painful to Allen.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Several episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', including "[[Missionary: Impossible]]", "[[Treehouse of Horror XIII]]" and "[[The Italian Bob]]" have poked fun at ''[[Family Guy]]'', implying that MacFarlane's show is guilty of stealing jokes and premises from the Simpsons. However, the producers of both shows have said that there is no serious feud between the two of them and their shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47771 | title = Interview: Matt Groening | accessdate = 2006-12-12 | author = Nathan Rabin | date = 2006-04-26 | work = The A.V.

In 2017 the Australian television show host [[Grant Denyer]] was interviewed on the radio programme ''[[The Grill Team]]'', which is on [[2MMM]]. In the interview, ''The Grill Team''{{'}}s co-host [[Matty Johns]] told an amusing anecdote about introducing a child to the board game ''[[Test Match (board game)|Test Match]]''. Later that morning, Grant Denyer was interviewed on the radio programme ''[[The Kyle and Jackie O Show]]'', which is on [[KIIS 106.5]]. In that interview, he told the same anecdote about ''Test Match'', passing it off as his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://au.be.yahoo.com/entertainment/celebrity/a/34283262/grant-denyer-banned-from-triple-m-and-kiis-fm-radio-stations-for-stealing-story-yahoo7-be/#page1 | title = Grant Denyer Banned From Triple M and KIIS FM Radio Stations For Stealing Story | accessdate = 2017-01-28 | author = Leah Cohen | date = 2017-01-28 | work = Yahoo7Be | publisher = Yahoo!7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recourse and consequences==
There is, historically, very little [[legal recourse]] taken in cases of joke theft. Some comics, however, have chosen to exact their own justice. [[W. C. Fields]] reportedly paid fifty dollars to have a thieving comic's legs broken.&lt;ref name="radartake" /&gt;

"You have a better chance of stopping a serial killer than a serial thief in comedy," said comedian [[David Brenner]]. "If we could protect our jokes, I'd be a retired billionaire in Europe somewhere – and what I just said is original."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/24/entertainment/et-joketheft24|title=Funny, that was my joke|last=Welkos|first=Robert W.|date=2007-07-24|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2018 study in the ''American Sociological Review'', "most instances of possible joke theft are ambiguous owing to the potential for simultaneous and coincidental discovery".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reilly|first=Patrick|date=2018-08-17|title=No Laughter among Thieves: Authenticity and the Enforcement of Community Norms in Stand-Up Comedy|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0003122418791174|journal=American Sociological Review|language=en|pages=000312241879117|doi=10.1177/0003122418791174|issn=0003-1224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study argues:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"that accusations are not strongly coupled to jokes’ similarity, and enforcement depends mainly on the extent to which insiders view the comic in question as being authentic to the community. Comics who are oriented toward external rewards, have a track record of anti-social behavior, and exhibit lackluster on-stage craft are vulnerable to joke theft accusations even in borderline cases because those inauthentic characteristics are typical of transgressors. Vulnerability is greatest for comics who enjoy commercial success despite low peer esteem."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Joseph Smith Sr.''' (July 12, 1771 – September 14, 1840) was the father of [[Joseph Smith|Joseph Smith Jr.]], the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]. Joseph Sr. was also one of the [[Eight Witnesses]] of the [[Book of Mormon]], which Mormons believe was translated by Smith Jr. from [[golden plates]]. In 1833, Smith Sr. was named the first [[Presiding Patriarch (Mormonism)|patriarch]] of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] (which was renamed to the Church of the Latter Day Saints&lt;ref name = 1834name&gt;"Minutes of a Conference", ''[[Evening and Morning Star]]'', [http://www.centerplace.org/history/ems/v2n20.htm vol. 2, no. 20], p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1834 and Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints&lt;ref name = 1838name1&gt;''Manuscript History of the Church'', LDS Church Archives, book A-1, p. 37; reproduced in [[Dean C.

Smith tried his hands at several professions, including farmer, teacher&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/ensign/1979/09/joseph-smith-and-nauvoos-youth?lang=eng&amp;_r=1], &lt;/ref&gt;, and shop-keeper, none of which proved very successful.&lt;ref name="EOM" /&gt; He moved his family to [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra, New York]], in 1816 and began to make payments on a farm located on the edge of neighboring [[Manchester, New York|Manchester Township]]. He was raised to the degree of Master Mason on May 7, 1818, in Ontario Lodge No. 23 of Canandaigua, New York.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In the Palmyra–Manchester area, Smith and his sons were involved in a number of treasure digging excavations in the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Vogel]], [http://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V27N03_211.pdf "The Location of Joseph Smith's Early Treasure Quests"], ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'' '''27'''(3) (1994): 197–231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on a frame house at the farm was halted by the unexpected death of Smith's eldest son, [[Alvin Smith (brother of Joseph Smith)|Alvin]], in 1823. Smith subsequently failed to make payments on the farm.&lt;ref name="EOM" /&gt; Lemuel Durfee purchased it as a favor to the family and allowed the Smiths to continue there as renters through 1830.

&lt;!--I don't see how this needs to be brought out here?  Doesn't seem like a very important/formative event:
In 1824, rumors began circulating that the body of Smith's son Alvin had been exhumed from his grave and dissected. To dispel the rumors, from September to November 1824, he published a notice in a local newspaper that he and his neighbors had themselves exhumed the grave, and found Alvin's body undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;''Wayne Sentinel'', September 25, 1824&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;
Though a spiritual man, Smith showed little interest in organized religion and was content to allow his wife control over the religious upbringing of their children. This indifference bothered Lucy very much. After much prayer, she said she had received a divine witness that her husband would some day accept "the pure and undefiled Gospel of the Son of God."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith professed that he had visionary dreams with highly symbolic content, perhaps related to his ambivalence about religious faith and sometimes presaging events to come. These dreams continued after the family's move to Palmyra until he had had seven in all; Lucy remembered five well enough to quote in detail.&lt;ref&gt;Smith&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book of Mormon==
In the late 1820s, Smith's son, Joseph Jr., began to tell the family about [[golden plates]], which he said contained a record of the ancient inhabitants of the Americas. In September 1827, Joseph Jr. said he obtained the plates. In the following years, Joseph Jr. said he translated the plates into English through the use of the [[Urim and Thummim (Latter Day Saints)|Urim and Thummim]], a sacred device given to him by the [[angel Moroni]]. When the work was near completion, at the end of June 1829, Joseph Sr. and seven other men signed a joint statement, testifying that they had both lifted the plates and seen the engravings on the plates. Known as the "[[Eight Witnesses#Testimony|Testimony of the Eight Witnesses]]", this statement was published with the first edition of the [[Book of Mormon]] and has been a part of nearly all subsequent editions.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/introduction?lang=eng Testimony of Eight Witnesses]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith was [[Baptism (Latter Day Saints)|baptised]] when the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] was formally organized on April 6, 1830. When Joseph Jr. saw Joseph Sr. come up out of the water, he is reported to have cried, "Oh! My God I have lived to see my own father baptized into the true church of Jesus Christ!"&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presiding Patriarch==
In January 1831, Smith and his family moved to the church's new headquarters in [[Kirtland, Ohio]]. He was ordained to be the church's first [[Presiding Patriarch (Mormonism)|Presiding Patriarch]] on December 18, 1833.

In reference to his father's role as patriarch of the church, Joseph Jr. likened his father to [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], the first biblical patriarch: "So shall it be with my father; he shall be called a prince over his posterity, holding the keys of the patriarchal priesthood over the kingdom of God on earth, even the Church of the Latter Day Saints".&lt;ref&gt;Bates and Smith, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of his new role, Smith presided in council meetings and administered [[patriarchal blessings]].

On September 3, 1837, Smith was also made an Assistant Counselor to his son in the [[First Presidency]] of the church.

==Deathbed blessings==

Smith moved with his family to [[Far West, Missouri]], in 1838 and from there to the church's new headquarters at [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], in 1839. Old age and illnesses had taken their toll and by the end of summer 1840, Smith realized he was dying. He called his family around him to administer patriarchal blessings.

He blessed his wife: "Mother, do you not know that you are the mother of as great a family as ever lived upon the earth. ... They are raised up to do the Lord's work".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, chap. 52&lt;/ref&gt; He blessed and ordained his eldest surviving son, [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] to succeed to the office of [[Presiding Patriarch (Mormonism)|Presiding Patriarch]] by right of [[Lineal Succession (Mormonism)|lineage]].

Smith died in Nauvoo on September 14, 1840.

===Critical reception===
'A Band of Angels' was reviewed in the New Statesman, which said: "Her book is characterised by a scholarly seriousness and the disarmingly unapologetic way she links the personal, the political and the institutional. Avoiding clichés, she excavates the experiences of a wide range of women, letting them speak for themselves. Strikingly, she also refers to her own experiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/08/band-angels-kate-cooper-witty-flawed-brilliant-and-forgotten-women-integral-early-ch|title=Band of Angels by Kate Cooper: The witty, flawed, brilliant and forgotten women integral to early Christianity|website=www.newstatesman.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was described as '‘the best kind of popular history.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/08/band-angels-kate-cooper-witty-flawed-brilliant-and-forgotten-women-integral-early-ch|title=Band of Angels by Kate Cooper: The witty, flawed, brilliant and forgotten women integral to early Christianity|website=www.newstatesman.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more mixed view was taken in a review in the Daily Telegraph, which found "Cooper has written a highly readable and important work of the history of religion. She wears her evident scholarship lightly, but the text is suffused with personal, imaginative and emotional perspectives. From the prologue, with its memories of her childhood and her mother, to the epilogue's fictitious portrayal of a virgin mother at the Council of Chalcedon in the fifth century, she abandons the detachment of the professional historian. While this can work well in the realms of human history, it seems to me problematic in the domain of religious history. This fine book, in other words, left me wondering whether Prof Cooper wasn’t having her faith claims and eating them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/historybookreviews/10259692/Band-of-Angels-the-Forgotten-World-of-Early-Christian-Women-by-Kate-Cooper-review.html|title=Band of Angels: the Forgotten World of Early Christian Women by Kate Cooper, review|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Guardian review said the book was "as much an exercise in historical detective work as anything else, an act of reading between and behind the lines, rescuing these lost women from ancient sources, assessing their influence, and placing their lives in a broader social and historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/04/band-angels-kate-cooper-review|title=Band of Angels: The Forgotten World of Early Christian Women by Kate Cooper – review|last=Tripney|first=Natasha|date=2013-08-04|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Singes Sosen.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Monkeys'' by [[Mori Sosen]]]]

The '''Kyoto school''' (京都派 ''-ha'') was a collection of several styles and schools of [[Japanese painting]] of the late [[Edo period]]. Though there are many broad similarities between the styles within the school, these styles display key differences that separate them. Many were in fact reactions to one another, an artist or group of artists seeking to express themselves differently from those around them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ideals of the East: The Spirit of Japanese Art|last=Okakura|first=Kakuzo|publisher=Dover Publications, Inc.|year=2005|isbn=978-0-486-44024-8|location=Mineola, New York|pages=87-89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those subscribers of the Kyoto school found themselves at odds with the state sanctioned Kanō school, thus contributing to the vague nature of the former. 

[[Okakura Kakuzō|Kakuzo Okakura]], predominant Japanese art historian of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, traced the origins of the Kyoto school to the schools of both [[Qing dynasty|Manchu-shin]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties in China. The two latter schools focused on the power of the artist as a lay person or scholar, as opposed to a professional.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Okakura is swift with a critique of the Kyoto school's attempts to repurpose the Japanese tradition of copying works from other (predominantly Chinese) cultures, a technique known as ''[[utsushi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kameda-Madar|first=Kazuko|date=2014-09-01|title=Copying and Theory in Edo-Period Japan (1615–1868)|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8365.12111/abstract|journal=Art History|language=en|volume=37|issue=4|pages=708–727|doi=10.1111/1467-8365.12111|issn=1467-8365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more prominent schools under the Kyoto school umbrella was the [[Shijo school|Shijō school]], named after the street where many of the artists had their studios. ''Shijō'' (四条) literally translates to 'fourth avenue.' This school sought to produce a synthesis of the more realistic style of [[Maruyama Okyo|Maruyama Ōkyo]] with that of the ''[[nanga (art)|nanga]]'' or Southern School styles. [[Mori Sosen]] was one of the more prominent painters in the Shijō school.

The ''nanga'' or Southern School, meanwhile, rebelled against the realism of Ōkyo and the Shijō artists, seeking to return to the inspiration and style of [[Chinese painting|China's]] [[Southern School]].

Located in the [[San Francisco Bay]], [[Alcatraz Island]] and [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]] have been cited as one of the most haunted places in America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/19/americas-most-haunted-places_n_1979767.html|title=America's Most Haunted Places|publisher=''[[Huffington Post]]''|date=19 October 2012|accessdate=6 November 2012|first=Rebecca|last=Dolan}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wetzel|2008|p=33}} and also as the most haunted prison in the country.{{sfn|Person|Taylor|2010|p=26}}
The Native Americans mentioned the evil spirits they purportedly  encountered on the island long before it became a federal prison.{{sfn|Lynch|Canwell|Sutherland|p=125}} [[Mark Twain]] documented the eerie atmosphere of the island after visiting it, described it as "being as cold as winter, even in the summer months."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-14745246.html|title=The beauty on the bay, San Francisco's natural and manmade charms await you|publisher=''Sunday Gazette Mail'', accessed via [[HighBeam Research]]|date=1 February 2004|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prisoners, rangers and visitors have reported a wide range of alleged ghostly activity on Alcatraz, from whispering in cells and locked cell doors shutting, to phantom figures in corridors, cold spots and even the sounds of musical instruments and sewing machines. Officials for Alcatraz have dismissed the reports of ghosts at Alcatraz as nonsense and deny their existence.&lt;ref name="WWN"&gt;{{cite book|title=Weekly World News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA21|publisher=''Weekly World News''|date=29 March 1994|page=21|issn=0199-574X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceptions of Alcatraz==
[[File:Alcatraz dawn 2005-01-07.jpg|thumb|[[Alcatraz Island]]]]
Jerry Lewis Champion  stated that it is "easy to see that Alcatraz Island contains all the legend and aura for the tales of ghosts and lost souls."{{sfn|Lewis Champion Jr|2011|p=165}}  The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' describes Alcatraz as the "most notorious federal penitentiary this country has ever known. Its history runs far and deep, as do the stories, the rumors, and the legends", and cited it as one of five major haunted spots in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/tv/alcatraz-arg-j-j-abrams/#/0|title=‘Alcatraz’ ARG: Unlocking the secrets of J.J.

According to historians, long before the prison opened on Alcatraz, early explorers to the island believed it to be haunted and it developed a reputation as a "bad place".{{sfn|Oliver|1998|p=16}}{{sfn|Needham|Needham|1976}} Western explorers visiting the island felt it had a disturbing atmosphere and spoke of the moonlit paths during the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=

Even though they avoided the island as they believed that evil spirits resided there, they were using it for deporting their criminals under the tribal law to live on the island in isolation. They also gathered eggs of birds and marine food from the island. Even after the Spanish became aware of the island in 1759, and started spreading [[Christianity]], the natives who did not want to convert used the islands as their refuge.

''[[The Washington Post]]'' has also claimed that Alcatraz is a place "where visitors can sense the dread of past inhabitants still trapped in the atmosphere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8972121.html|author=Barrett, Andrea|title=Consuming Silence; While anarchists terrify America, these patients in Saranac Lake must endure their own quiet terror|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'', accessed via [[HighBeam Research]]|date=14 October 2007|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New York Magazine]]'' has said that although the penitentiary hasn't been operational since 1963, it "remains ultra sinister, perversely fascinating, iconic."&lt;ref name="LLC1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=New York Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QOECAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA60|accessdate=7 April 2013|date=10 June 1996|publisher=New York Media, LLC|page=60|issn=0028-7369}}&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary ''Haunted Alcatraz'', broadcast on the Travel Channel, has said "there is little question that Alcatraz holds a particular place in our collective imagination, consistently evoking feeling, stirring and dark" and that the "power of the island" still captivates visitors after departure.&lt;ref name="HA4"/&gt; A 1995 book included Alcatraz as one of ''The 25 Scariest Places in the World''.&lt;ref name="EmertJarrett1995"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Emert|first1=Phyllis Raybin|last2=Jarrett|first2=Lauren|title=The 25 Scariest Places in the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yk5IWhYAvdMC|accessdate=7 April 2013|year=1995|publisher=Lowell House|isbn=978-1-56565-277-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prison background==
[[File:Alcatraz Light citadel Hopi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hopi people|Hopi]] inmates of the original military prison]]
{{main|Alcatraz Citadel}}
[[Alcatraz Citadel]], also known as Fort Alcatraz, was the original military defense and prison on Alcatraz Island. The citadel was built in 1859 as a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] military defense, and began function as a war camp in 1861 and long-term military prison in 1868. During the [[American Civil War]], the citadel and its [[Artillery battery|batteries]] provided an important line of defense. The island continued to develop in the 1870s and 1880s, and in 1893, the first hospital on Alcatraz opened. A new upper prison was built in 1904, but after the citadel ceased function as a military defense in 1907 and the original citadel collapsed the following year, a $250,000 concrete military prison was erected between 1910 and 1912. In 1933–1934, the building was modernized and became the [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]]. It incarcerated some of America's most dangerous criminals between 1934 and 1963. During its time as a Penitentiary, 8 people were murdered at the prison by inmates; a guard was murdered in the laundry room in the late 1930s, two died during the ill-fated 1946 escape attempt, and five inmates were killed in random attacks.&lt;ref name="LA 07"/&gt; Five prisoners committed suicide, and at least a dozen died in total trying to escape.&lt;ref name="LA 07"&gt;{{cite news|author=Glionna, John M.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/apr/07/travel/la-trw-watchman7apr07/2|title=Alcatraz: Getting rattled on 'the Rock|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|date=7 April 2007|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HA1"/&gt;

==Reported activity in the prison==

===Claims by prisoners and guards===
&lt;!--WHO SAID THIS QUOTE? WAS THIS FLOYD OR ANOTHER WRITER?  I WOULD DELETE "SUCH WRITERS AS" LEAVES IT AMBIGUOUS--&gt;
According to writers such as E. Floyd, "almost every guard and official who served there until it was shut down by Attorney General [[Robert Kennedy]] in the early 1960s experienced something out of the ordinary" and said that park rangers occasionally still reveal "shocking supernatural secrets".{{sfn|Floyd|2002|p=1}} During its time as a Penitentiary, both inmates and guards reported a wide range of purported ghostly activity in the prison.  It is reputedly haunted by the ghosts of Native American prisoners and officials who perished on the island during the American Civil War and at the military prison.{{sfn|Vale|2008|p=30}}&lt;ref name="SFC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Night-in-Alcatraz-D-Block-a-haunting-experience-3214704.php|title=Night in Alcatraz' D Block a haunting experience|publisher= ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''|date=4 October 2009|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners, many of whom were declared insane after serving time at Alcatraz,&lt;ref name="SFC"/&gt; reported peculiar whispering sounds in the middle of the night, floating blue lights and figures, moaning, and the clanking of chains in cells which were known to be unoccupied.{{sfn|Floyd|2002|p=3}} One inmate in D-block was reported to have seen glowing red eyes in the dark and screamed for hours.{{sfn|Vale|2008|p=30}} He was found dead the following morning with a purple face, bulging eyes, and unidentified strangle marks around his throat.&lt;ref name="News2004"/&gt;{{sfn|Wetzel|2008|p=38}}&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt;   
[[File:Alcatraz C-Block.jpg|thumb|left|C-block]]
Guards initially laughed at the claims of ghosts by inmates but as time progressed some were reported to have experienced unusual activity themselves, including feeling cold spots, unseen fingers on the back of their neck, and crying in the night.{{sfn|Floyd|2002|p=4}} The first Warden of Alcatraz, [[James A. Johnston]], was reputed to have heard a woman sobbing while conducting tour of the prison.{{sfn|Floyd|2002|p=4}} Occupants of the prison reported seeing prisoners from the early military prison in 19th century garb walking the corridors in A-Block which would disappear when approached by the guards, and one member of staff reputedly saw a gang of Native American prisoners marching around in a circle before vanishing.{{sfn|Floyd|2002|p=4}} Phantom gunfire, cannon blasts and fire alarms going off on their own accord have all been reported.{{sfn|Floyd|2002|p=3}} The Warden's House, now a burnt out shell since the [[Occupation of Alcatraz]], is also reputed to be haunted;{{sfn|Kessler|1979|p=47}} during the time of the penitentiary, several guards reported seeing the spectre of a man with mutton-chop sideburns during a party wearing a gray suit and brimmed cap, leaving the room icy cold and extinguishing the fire in the Ben Franklin stove.{{sfn|Person|Taylor|2010|p=22}} A phantom lighthouse has also been said to have emerged from the fog of San Francisco bay.{{sfn|Floyd|2002|p=1}}

Former inmate Leon "Whitey" Thompson, who worked as a guide at Alcatraz for many years and later visited it regularly before his death in 2005, believed that Alcatraz Island is haunted and has stated that "he could feel it" while he was incarcerated there.  He later believed the prison to be "damned", and often had the sense of being watched by spirits.&lt;ref name="HA4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HA1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgbi0PZt0p8|title=Haunted Alcatraz, Part 1|publisher=Travel Channel|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in the prison, Thompson was friendly with an inmate named Johnny Haus, a big Texan. He last saw him on 25 October 1962 when he left Alcatraz and knew he'd never see Haus again.&lt;ref name="HA1"/&gt; One day in the 1980s when Thompson was alone in the cellhouse waiting for visitors to arrive for a tour, he claimed to have seen a large dark figure at the end of the "Michigan Avenue" corridor.  He saw the apparition walk around the corner and out of sight. Thompson rushed to the end of the corridor, but nobody was there. He believed the ghost to be that of Haus, by the way he walked and the feeling which the figure gave off.  Afterwards, Thompson said "I don't care what anybody says, that was Johnny Haus".&lt;ref name="HA2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AbSQOOfRyo|title=Haunted Alcatraz, Part 2|publisher=Travel Channel|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims by visitors and rangers===
[[File:Alcatraz D Block cell.jpg|thumb|right|D-Block cell of Alcatraz]]

===Claims by investigators===

Numerous investigators and psychics such as [[Annette Martin (psychic)|Annette Martin]] and [[Jeanne Borgen]] and paranormal teams have sought to "contact spirits" at Alcatraz.{{sfn|Auerbach|2003|p=21}} [[KGO Radio]] Morning News anchor [[Ted Wygant]], a skeptic of the paranormal, visited Alcatraz in 1982 with psychic Jeanne Borgen and spent the night there.&lt;ref name="HA1"/&gt; Wygant said for most of the duration of the visit they found nothing, but around 3 am in the utility corridor, the place where three of the men of the 1946 [[Battle of Alcatraz]] were shot dead, he said that although it was pitch black, he suddenly got a "tremendous feeling of anger" and felt an evil presence lying on the floor at the place where the men had died.&lt;ref name="HA3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIcqxWUOTmI|title=Haunted Alcatraz, Part 3|publisher=Travel Channel|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started cursing and said that he felt a strong compulsion to fire a gun at people.&lt;ref name="HA3"/&gt; Borgen said that it left Wygant quite out of character, and said that when they turned on the light, "his face was changed, you could see the anger and hate in his eyes".&lt;ref name="HA3"/&gt; Wygant has said though that it is quite difficult for him to believe there was something really there, but he is certain that he felt that something had happened.&lt;ref name="HA3"/&gt; In 1984, paranormal investigator and writer [[Michael Kouri]] claimed that he visited the prison and in a trance was spoken to by the spirit of a dead prisoner who told him that he had been beaten and had his legs broken and was placed in solitary confinement.{{sfn|Floyd|2002|p=5}} According to the ''Los Angeles Times'', one woman, who claimed to be psychic, began speaking German in a child's voice on a tour of the prison hospital, and said that Alcatraz was frequented by spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jul/12/local/me-21387/2|title=Willing Captives of Alcatraz Lore|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|accessdate=7 April 2013|first=John M.|last=Glionna|date=12 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|right|Alcatraz sewing room.jpg|180|Henri Young.jpg|180|Left:Sewing in the [[New Industries Building]]. Right:[[Henri Young]]}}
In the early 1990s, ''[[Sightings (TV series)|Sightings]]'' investigated the prison and claimed that they have evidence of ghostly activity caught on film at Alcatraz.{{sfn|Floyd|2002|p=5}} A [[CBS]] news team was also reputed to have experienced strange activity in the prison hospital and in the laundry room.{{sfn|Floyd|2002|p=5}} Psychic [[Daena Smoller]] and psychologist [[Larry Montz]] investigated the prison and found nothing in D-Block or the cellhouse but equipped with a [[magnetometer]], they picked up a reading in the [[New Industries Building]] in the area where inmates had been employed in sewing.&lt;ref name="HA4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UHBEN5B2r4|title=Haunted Alcatraz, Part 4|publisher=Travel Channel|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoller says that she picked up on the intense sound of buzzing of sewing machines and energy of the workplace and suddenly felt an intense pain in her neck.&lt;ref name="HA4"/&gt; Nothing happened for several minutes until the magnetometer reportedly "jumped".&lt;ref name="HA4"/&gt; Montz said that unless there was an electromagnetic device in the building which would cause it to have taken place, then there was "definitely paranormal activity taking place".&lt;ref name="HA4"/&gt; Apparently unknown to the investigators, the incident had occurred in the area that [[Henri Young]] had murdered [[Rufus McCain]], stabbing him in the neck.&lt;ref name="HA4"/&gt;

==Rebuttal of haunted claims==
Despite former guards and park rangers revealing their paranormal experiences at Alcatraz, officials for Alcatraz have publicly dismissed the reports of ghosts at Alcatraz as nonsense and deny their existence; an official for Alcatraz said in 1994, "These ridiculous ghost stories will stop tourists from visiting. And how can these people say they heard canaries? We don't have any birds in here."&lt;ref name="WWN"/&gt; [[Mary Forgione]] of the ''Los Angeles Times'' also stated that "The National Park Service, which operates the island as a tourist site, pooh-poohs this, calling it Hollywood hype."&lt;ref name="LATForgione"/&gt; Alcatraz, run by the National Park Service, therefore does not operate an "official ghost tour"  for tourists, but such tours, organized by independent parties, are permitted in the prison.&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt; Former prison guard Frank Healy, who served at Alcatraz as a young man from 1948 to 1951, has said that it was easy to gain a negative feeling at the prison at a time when it was all "doom and gloom", although he said that if any place would have ghosts it would be Alcatraz.&lt;ref name="HA2"/&gt;  [[Tracy Grant]] of ''The Washington Post'', in discussing the book "Ghost Hunt" which documents the alleged haunting at Alcatraz, has said "Authors Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson claim to be ghost hunters, and in this book they offer stories about the ghosts of inmates at Alcatraz prison and the idea that the ocean can be haunted. These stories are definitely scary, but don't take them too seriously. After all, ghosts aren't real. Are they?" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-29954246.html|author=Grant, Tracy|title=Stories to send a chill up your spine|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'', accessed via [[HighBeam Research]]|date=26 October 2007|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of the Legal systems of the world (en).png|thumb|Legal systems of the world]]
The contemporary '''legal systems of the world''' are generally based on one of four basic [[systems]]: [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[common law]], [[statutory law]], [[religious law]] or combinations of these. However, the legal system of each country is shaped by its unique history and so incorporates individual variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://saint-claire.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Legal-Systems-of-the-World.pdf|title=Legal Systems of the World|last=|first=|date= |website= |access-date=|publisher = Saint: Security Sector Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The science that studies Law at the level of legal systems is called [[Comparative Law]].

Both ''civil'' (also known as ''Roman'') and ''common'' law systems can be considered the most widespread in the world: civil law because it is the most widespread by landmass, and common law because it is employed by the greatest number of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Phillip|title=''Principles of International Insolvency''|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f_yWaV_-_l4C&amp;lpg=PT454&amp;ots=D-khdgPbR4&amp;dq=maps%20of%20world%20financial%20law%20common%20law&amp;pg=PT454#v=onepage&amp;q=maps%20of%20world%20financial%20law%20common%20law&amp;f=false|date=2007|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Phillip|title=''Maps of World Financial Law:Law and practice of international finance series''|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Maps_of_World_Financial_Law.html?id=Z5vKGAAACAAJ|date=2008|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''English Common Law is the most widespread legal system in the world''|url=https://www.sweetandmaxwell.co.uk/about-us/press-releases/061108.pdf|date=November 2008|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
{{Main|Civil law (legal system)}}
[[File:Milkau Oberer Teil der Stele mit dem Text von Hammurapis Gesetzescode 369-2.png|thumb|right|150px|[[Shamash]] (the [[Babylonia]]n sun god) hands King [[Hammurabi]] a [[Code of Hammurabi|code of law]]]]

The central source of law that is recognized as authoritative is [[Codification (law)|codifications]] in a constitution or [[statute]] passed by [[legislature]], to amend a code.
While the concept of codification dates back to the [[Code of Hammurabi]] in [[Babylon]] ca. 1790 BC, civil law systems derive from the [[Roman Empire]] and, more particularly, the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' issued by the Emperor [[Justinian]] ca. AD 529. This was an extensive reform of the law in the [[Byzantine Empire]], bringing it together into codified documents. Civil law was also partly influenced by [[religious law]]s such as [[Canon law]] and [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref name=Badr&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 [Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, February 24–25, 1977]|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198 [196–8]|doi=10.2307/839667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=J-Makdisi /&gt; Civil law today, in theory, is interpreted rather than developed or made by judges. Only [[legislature|legislative]] enactments (rather than legal [[precedent]]s, as in common law) are considered legally binding.

Scholars of [[comparative law]] and economists promoting the [[legal origins theory]] usually subdivide civil law into four distinct groups:
* '''French civil law''': in France, the [[Benelux]] countries, Italy, Romania, Spain and former colonies of those countries;
* '''[[Law of Germany#Civil law|German civil law]]''': in Germany, Austria, Russia, Switzerland, Estonia, Latvia,  Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo*, Macedonia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Serbia, Greece, [[Portugal]] and [[Portuguese Empire|its former colonies]], Turkey, and East Asian countries including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan (Republic of China);
* '''[[Scandinavian law|Scandinavian civil law]]''': in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. As historically integrated in the Scandinavian cultural sphere, Finland and Iceland also inherited the system.
* '''[[Chinese law]]''': a mixture of civil law and [[socialist law]] in use in the People's Republic of China.

However, some of these legal systems are often and more correctly said to be of hybrid nature:
*'''Napoleonic to Germanistic influence ([[Italian law|Italian civil law]]) '''
The [[Italy|Italian]] civil code of 1942 replaced the original one of 1865, introducing germanistic elements due to the geopolitical alliances of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.teoriaestoriadeldirittoprivato.com/index.php?com=statics&amp;option=index&amp;cID=132 |title = Towards a Civil Code: The Italian Experience|last = Triggiano|first = Annalisa|website = Teoria e Storia del Diritto Privato}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian approach has been imitated by other countries including the [[Netherlands]] (1992), [[Argentina]] (2014), [[Brazil]] (2002) and [[Portugal]] (1966). Most of them have innovations introduced  by the Italian legislation, including the unification of the [[civil code|civil]] and [[Commercial code (law)|commercial code]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol16/iss2/8/ |title = On the Legal Method of the Uniform Commercial Code|journal = Law and Contemporary Problems|volume = 16|number = 2|first= Mitchell|last= Franklin|date = Spring 1951|pages = 330-343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Germanistic to Napoleonic influence ([[Swiss law|Swiss civil law]])'''
The [[Swiss civil code]] is considered mainly influenced by the German civil code and partly influenced by the French civil code.  The civil code of the [[Republic of Turkey]] is a slightly modified version of the Swiss code, adopted in 1926 during [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]'s presidency as part of the government's progressive reforms and secularization.

A comprehensive list of countries that base their legal system on a [[Codification (law)|codified]] civil law follows:

|The Spanish legal tradition had a great influence on the [[Civil Code of Argentina]], basically a work of the Argentine [[jurist]] [[Dalmacio Vélez Sársfield]], who dedicated five years of his life on this task. The Civil Code came into effect on 1 January 1871. Beyond the influence of the Spanish legal tradition, the Argentinian Civil Code was also inspired by the Draft of the Brazilian Civil Code, the [[wikt:Draft|Draft]] of the Spanish Civil Code of 1851, the [[Napoleonic code]] and the [[Civil Code (Chile)|Chilean Civil Code]]. The sources of this Civil Code also include various theoretical legal works, mainly of the great French jurists of the 19th century. It was the first Civil Law that consciously adopted as its cornerstone the distinction between i. rights from obligations and ii. real property rights, thus distancing itself from the French model.

The Argentinian Civil Code was also in effect in Paraguay, as per a [[Paraguayan]] law of 1880, until the new Civil Code went in force in 1987.

In Argentina, this 1871 Civil Code remained in force until August 2015, when it was replaced by the new ''Código Civil y Comercial de la Nación''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/235000-239999/235975/norma.htm |title=Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas Públicas - Argentina |publisher=InfoLEG |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jornadaonline.com/Pol%C3%ADtica/139234-Comienza-a-regir-el-nuevo-C%C3%B3digo-Civil-y-Comercial |title=Comienza a regir el nuevo Código Civil y Comercial |publisher=Jornadaonline.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|{{flagicon|Chile}} [[Law of Chile|Chile]]
|Based on the Chilean Civil Law inspired by the Napoleonic Civil Law. The Spanish legal tradition exercised an especially great influence on the civil code of Chile. On its turn, the Chilean civil code influenced to a large degree the drafting of the civil codes of other [[Latin-American]] states. For instance, the codes of Ecuador (1861) and Colombia (1873) constituted faithful reproductions of the Chilean code, but for very few exceptions. The compiler of the [[Civil Code of Chile]], Venezuelan [[Andrés Bello]], worked for its completion for almost 30 years, using elements, of the Spanish law on the one hand, and of other [[Western law]]s, especially of the French one, on the other. Indeed, it is noted that he consulted and used all of the codes that had been issued till then, starting from the era of [[Justinian]].

The Civil Code came into effect on 1 January 1857. The influence of the [[Napoleonic code]] and the Law of Castile of the Spanish colonial period (especially the ''[[Siete Partidas]]''), is great; it is observed however that ''e.g.'' in many provisions of [[property law|property]] or [[contract law]], the solutions of the French ''code civil'' were put aside in favor of pure [[Roman law]] or Castilian law.

The present Civil Code went into effect 1 January 1888, and was influenced by the [[Napoleonic Code]] and the Spanish Civil Code of 1889 (from its 1851 draft version).
|-
|{{flagicon|Croatia}} [[Law of Croatia|Croatia]]
|Based on the Germanic Civil Law. Croatian Law system is largely influenced by German and  Austrian law systems. It is significantly influenced by the [[Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Civil Code of the Austrian Empire]] from 1811, known in Croatia as ''"General Civil Law"'' ''("Opći građanski zakon")''. OGZ was in force from 1853&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?ID=45220 |title=Opći građanski zakonik &amp;#124; Hrvatska enciklopedija |publisher=Enciklopedija.hr |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1946. The [[Independent State of Croatia]], a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-controlled [[puppet state]] that was established in 1941 during [[World War II]], used the OGZ as a basis for the 1943 ''"Base of the Civil Code for the Independent State of Croatia"'' ''("Osnova građanskoga zakona za Nezavisnu Državu Hrvatsku")''. After the War, Croatia become a member of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Federation]] which enacted in 1946 the ''"Law on immediate voiding of regulations passed before April 6, 1941 and during the enemy occupation"'' ''("Zakon o nevaženju pravnih propisa donesenih prije 6. travnja 1941. i za vrijeme neprijateljske okupacije")''. By this law OGZ was declared invalid as a whole, but implementation of some of its legal rules was approved. During the post-War era, the Croatian legal system become influenced by elements of the [[socialist law]]. Croatian civil law was pushed aside, and it took norms of public law and legal regulation of the [[Socialization (economics)|social ownership]]. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia on June 25, 1991, the previous legal system was used as a base for writing new laws.  ''"The Law on Obligations"'' ''("Zakon o obveznim odnosima")'' was enacted in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Croatian legal history in the European context, Dalibor Čepulo, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Croatia as a [[European union]] member state implements elements of the [[Acquis communautaire|EU acquis]] into its legal system.

|{{flagicon|Guatemala}} [[Law of Guatemala|Guatemala]]
|Based on Napoleonic civil law. Guatemala has had three Civil Codes: the first one from 1877, a new one introduced in 1933, and the one currently in force, which was passed in 1963. This Civil Code has suffered some reforms throughout the years, as well as a few derogations relating to areas which have subsequently been regulated by newer laws, such as the Code of Commerce and the Law of the National Registry of Persons. In general, it follows the tradition of the Roman-French system of civil codification.

Regarding the theory of 'sources of law' in the Guatemalan legal system, the 'Ley del Organismo Judicial' recognizes 'the law' as the main legal source (in the sense of legislative texts), although it also establishes 'jurisprudence' as a complementary source. Although jurisprudence technically refers to judicial decisions in general, in practice it tends to be confused and identified with the concept of 'legal doctrine', which is a qualified series of identical resolutions in similar cases pronounced by higher courts (the Constitutional Court acting as a 'Tribunal de [[Amparo (law)|Amparo]]', and the Supreme Court acting as a 'Tribunal de Casación') whose theses become binding for lower courts.

==Common law==
{{Main|Common law}}
[[File:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|thumb|right|150px|King John of England signs [[Magna Carta]]]]
Common law and [[Equity (legal concept)|equity]] (legal concept) are systems of law whose sources are the decisions in cases by judges. In addition, every system will have a legislature that passes new laws and statutes. The relationships between statutes and judicial decisions can be complex. In some jurisdictions, such statutes may overrule judicial decisions or codify the topic covered by several contradictory or ambiguous decisions. In some jurisdictions, judicial decisions may decide whether the jurisdiction's constitution allowed a particular statute or statutory provision to be made or what meaning is contained within the statutory provisions. Statutes were allowed to be made by the government. Common law developed in England, influenced by [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] law and to a much lesser extent by the [[Norman conquest of England]], which introduced legal concepts from [[Norman law]], which, in turn, had its origins in [[Salic law]]. Common law was later inherited by the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and almost every former colony of the [[British Empire]] has adopted it ([[Malta]] being an exception). The doctrine of ''stare decisis'', also known as ''case law'' or ''[[precedent]] by courts'', is the major difference to codified civil law systems.

Common law is currently in practice in [[Law of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], most of the [[Law of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] ([[English law|England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland law|Northern Ireland]]), [[Law of Australia|Australia]], [[Law of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Law of Bangladesh|Bangladesh]], [[Law of India|India]] (excluding [[Goa civil code|Goa]]),{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed because the Supreme Court of India's decisions override many lower courts|date=June 2014}} [[Law of Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Law of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Law of Canada|Canada]] (excluding [[Quebec law|Quebec]]), [[Law of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], the [[Law of the United States|United States]] (on a state level excluding [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]]), and many other places. In addition to these countries, several others have adapted the common law system into a mixed system. For example, Nigeria operates largely on a common law system, but incorporates religious law.

In the [[European Union]], the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] takes an approach mixing civil law (based on the treaties) with an attachment to the importance of case law. One of the most fundamental documents to shape common law is the English [[Magna Carta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html|accessdate=10 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which placed limits on the power of the English Kings. It served as a kind of medieval bill of rights for the aristocracy and the judiciary who developed the law.

==Religious law==
{{main|Religious law}}

Religious law refers to the notion of a religious system or document being used as a legal source, though the methodology used varies. For example, the use of Jewish and [[Halakha]] for public law has a static and unalterable quality, precluding amendment through legislative acts of government or development through judicial precedent; Christian [[Canon law]] is more similar to [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in its use of [[code (law)|codes]]; and Islamic [[Sharia]] law (and [[Fiqh]] jurisprudence) is based on legal [[precedent]] and reasoning by [[analogy]] (''[[Qiyas]]''), and is thus considered similar to [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Finance: Law, Economics, and Practice|first=Mahmoud A.|last=El-Gamal|year=2006|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-86414-3|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main kinds of religious law are [[Sharia]] in Islam, [[Halakha]] in Judaism, and [[canon law]] in some Christian groups. In some cases these are intended purely as individual moral guidance, whereas in other cases they are intended and may be used as the basis for a country's legal system. The latter was particularly common during the [[Middle Ages]].

[[File:Aleppo Codex Joshua 1 1.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Aleppo Codex: 10th century Hebrew Bible with Masoretic pointing]]
The Halakha is followed by [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|conservative]] Jews in both ecclesiastical and civil relations. No country is fully governed by Halakha, but two Jewish people may decide, because of personal belief, to have a dispute heard by a Jewish court, and be bound by its rulings.

The Islamic legal system of [[Sharia]] (Islamic law) and [[Fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence) is the most widely used [[religious law]], and one of the three most common legal systems in the world alongside common law and civil law.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 – Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, 24–25 February 1977|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198|doi=10.2307/839667}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on both [[divine law]], derived from the [[Qur'an and Sunnah]], and the rulings of [[Ulema]] (jurists), who used the methods of ''[[Ijma]]'' (consensus), ''[[Qiyas]]'' (analogical deduction), ''[[Ijtihad]]'' (research) and ''[[Urf]]'' (common practice) to derive ''[[Fatwā]]'' (legal opinions). An Ulema was required to qualify for an ''[[Ijazah]]'' ([[Law degree|legal]] [[doctorate]]) at a ''[[Madrasa]]'' ([[law school]]/[[college]]) before they could issue ''Fatwā''.&lt;ref name=G-Makdisi&gt;{{citation|last=Makdisi|first=George|title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=109|issue=2|date=April–June 1989|pages=175–182 [175–77]|doi=10.2307/604423}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Islamic Golden Age]], classical Islamic law may have had an [[Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe|influence]] on the development of common law&lt;ref name=J-Makdisi&gt;{{citation|last=Makdisi|first=John A.|title=The Islamic Origins of the Common Law|journal=[[North Carolina Law Review]]|date=June 1999|volume=77|issue=5|pages=1635–1739}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several civil law institutions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 – Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, 24–25 February 1977|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198 [196–8]|doi=10.2307/839667}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharia law governs a number of Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, though most countries use Sharia law only as a supplement to national law. It can relate to all aspects of civil law, including property rights, contracts or public law.

===Civil law and canon law===
{{main|Canon law (Catholic Church)}}
[[Canon law]] is not divine law, properly speaking, because it is not found in revelation. Instead, it is seen as human law inspired by the word of God and applying the demands of that revelation to the actual situation of the church. [[Canon law]] regulates the internal ordering of the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]]. Canon law is amended and adapted by the legislative authority of the church, such as [[episcopal conference|councils of bishops]], individual bishops for their respective sees, the [[Pope]] for the entire Catholic Church, and the British Parliament for the [[Church of England]].

Codification occurred in 1866 with the enactment of the [[Civil Code of Lower Canada]], which continued in force when the modern Province of Quebec was created at Confederation in 1867.  Canadian federal law in force in Quebec is based on common law, but federal statutes also take into account the bijuridical nature of Canada and use both common law and civil law terms where appropriate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6457">The '''Livingston Survey''' is a biannual survey (conducted in June and December of every year) about the [[economy of the United States]] conducted by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/livingston-survey/|title = Livingston Survey|accessdate = April 17, 2014|publisher = [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Livingston Survey was created and originally administered by columnist Joseph Livingston in 1946. He administered it biannually until his death in 1990. In 1990, the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]] took over responsibility for administering the survey.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;&lt;ref name=details&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/livingston-survey/livingston-documentation.pdf|title = Livingston Survey Documentation|publisher = [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]|date = November 26, 2013|accessdate = April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1997 paper by [[Dean Croushure]] of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia described the history of the survey, argued for its usefulness in testing [[rational expectations]] hypotheses through the comparison of forecasts with reality, and explained how the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia was taking over the survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~dcrousho/docs/brma97dc.pdf|title = The Livingston Survey: Still Useful After All These Years|last = Croushure|first = Dean|authorlink = Dean Croushure|date = March–April 1997|accessdate = April 17, 2014|publisher = [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variables and data sources==

The forecasts made by the Livingston Survey of its variables are compared with actual values reported by the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] (in its [[Survey of Current Business]]), [[Federal Reserve Board]], and [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/livingston-survey/livingston-data-sources.pdf|title = Data Sources and Descriptions|accessdate = April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forecasts are made for the values of all variables six months from now and twelve months from now (i.e., coinciding in time with the next two administrations of the survey). The variables forecast are subdivided into variables reported quarterly, monthly, and daily. For variables reported quarterly, forecasts for the values two quarters from now and four quarters from now are recorded. For variables reported monthly, forecasts for the values six months from now and twelve months from now are recorded. Similarly, for variables reported daily, forecasts are recorded for the value on the ''last'' day of the month six months and twelve months from now.&lt;ref name=details/&gt;

In addition:

* The June survey includes forecasts for the annual average for the current year and for the next year.
* The December survey includes forecasts for the annual average for the current year and for the next two years.&lt;ref name=details/&gt;

Beginning with the survey of June 1990 (and excluding December 1990) two other long-range forecast questions were included in the survey:

* The 10-year annual-average rate of [[consumer price index]] inflation.
* The 10-year annual-average rate of growth in [[real GDP]].&lt;ref name=details/&gt;

The main variables are as follows:&lt;ref name=details/&gt;

* The quarterly variables include various measures of [[gross domestic product]] (including [[real GDP]] and [[nominal GDP]]).
* The monthly variables include measures of the [[consumer price index]], housing starts, industrial production, and unemployment.
* The daily variables include various interest rate measures and the [[S&amp;P 500]] index value.

==Reception==

===Academic research===

There is extensive academic research citing the Livingston Survey, including some devoted to evaluating the accuracy and bias in the forecasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/livingston-survey/academic-bibliography.cfm|title = Academic Bibliography|publisher = [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]|accessdate = April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Formation of Inflationary Expectations|last = Figlewski|first = Stephen|last2 = Wachtel|first2 = Paul|volume = 63|issue = 1|date = February 1981|journal = [[The Review of Economics and Statistics]]|pages = 1–10|publisher = [[MIT Press]]|jstor = 1924211|doi=10.2307/1924211}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a 1983 paper by Dietrich and Joines began with the observation: "For more than a decade, researchers have been using the Livingston survey data on inflationary expectations in empirical work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Rational Expectations, Informational Efficiency, and Tests Using Survey Data: A Comment|last = Dietrich|first = Kimball|last2 = Joines|first2 = Douglas|journal = [[The Review of Economics and Statistics]]|pages = 525–529|publisher = [[MIT Press]]|date = August 1983|jstor = 1924203|volume=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heyday of use for the Livingston Survey was the late 1970s and early 1980s, because it was the main survey of forecasts that had been around for a sufficiently long time at the time. Around 1990, research on forecast accuracy switched to using the [[Survey of Professional Forecasters]] and [[Blue Chip Economic Indicators]], and more recent research has focused on the [[Consensus Economics|Consensus Forecasts]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Reception in the press and blogs===

Livingston Survey forecasts have been cited by the financial press and blogs many times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economicgreenfield.com/2013/12/12/sp500-price-projections-livingston-survey-december-2013/|title = S&amp;P500 Price Projections – Livingston Survey December 2013|last = Kavadas|first = Ted|publisher = EconomicGreenfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econintersect.com/b2evolution/blog1.php/2013/12/12/livingston-survey-cut-predictions-for-growth-early-next-year|title = Livingston Survey: Cut Predictions for Growth Early Next Year|publisher = Global Economic Intersection|date = December 12, 2013|accessdate = April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and symbol==
[[File:Valvasor 1689 Ljubljana lintvern.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the city's coat of arms featuring the [[Saint George and the Dragon|dragon]] on top of the [[Ljubljana Castle|castle]], from [[Valvasor]]'s ''[[The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola]]'', 1689]]
The origin of name of the city, '''Ljubljana''', is unclear. In the Middle Ages, both the river and the town were also known by the German name '''Laibach'''. This name was in official use as an [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] until 1918, and it remains frequent as a German exonym, both in common speech and official use. &lt;!-- Please maintain the naming conventions [[Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_(geographic_names)#Alternative_names]] by adding alternative English or unofficial foreign names here--&gt; The city is alternatively named '''Lublana''' in many English language documents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ancestry.com/interactive/1002/44474_08_00011-00575?pid=17781166 U.S., World War II Draft Registration Cards, 1942 for Frank Hren], ancestry.com paid subscription site; accessed December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The city is called ''[[:szl:Lublana|Lublana]]'' in Silesian, ''[[:it:Lubiana|Lubiana]]'' in Italian, in {{lang-la|Labacum}} and anciently ''Aemona''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Libri Antichi Libri Rari |url=http://www.osservatoriolibri.com/luoghi.html |title=Città di stampa dei LIBRI ANTICHI dei LIBRI VECCHI dei LIBRI RARI |publisher=Osservatoriolibri.com |accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most scholars, the problem has been in how to connect the Slovene and the German names. The origin from the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''ljub''- "to love, like" was in 2007 supported as the most probable by the linguist [[Tijmen Pronk]], a specialist in comparative [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European linguistics]] and [[Slovene dialects|Slovene dialectology]], from the [[University of Leiden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hum.leiden.edu/lucl/organisation/members/pronktc2.html#contact |title=Dr T.C. (Tijmen) Pronk |publisher=Leiden University Centre for Linguistics, University of Leiden |accessdate=24 April 2012 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supported the thesis that the name of the river derived from the name of the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Folia Onomastica Croatica |volume=16 |year=2007 |pages=185–191 |issn=1330-0695 |title=The Etymology of Ljubljana – Laibach |first=Tijmen |last=Pronk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The linguist [[Silvo Torkar]], who specializes in Slovene personal and place names,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isjfr.zrc-sazu.si/sl/sodelavci/silvo-torkar-sl#page-title |title=Dr. Silvo Torkar |language=Slovenian |publisher=Fran Ramovš Institute of the Slovenian Language |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued at the same place for the thesis that the name ''Ljubljana'' derives from ''Ljubija'', the original name of the [[Ljubljanica|Ljubljanica River]] flowing through it, itself derived from the Old Slavic male name ''Ljubovid'', "the one of a lovely appearance". The name ''Laibach'', he claimed, was actually a hybrid of German and Slovene and derived from the same personal name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ljubljana.si/file/32485/ljubljana_l13_st_08-09_2008.pdf |title=O neprepoznanih ali napačno prepoznanih slovanskih antroponimih v slovenskih zemljepisnih imenih: Čadrg, Litija, Trebija, Ljubija, Ljubljana, Biljana |language=Slovenian |trans-title=On the unrecognized or incorrectly recognized Slavic anthroponyms in Slovenian toponyms: Čadrg, Litija, Trebija, Ljubija, Ljubljana, Biljana |pages=257–273 |issn=1330-0695 |journal=The Etymology of Ljubljana – Laibach |first=Tijmen |last=Pronk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823142818/http://www.ljubljana.si/file/32485/ljubljana_l13_st_08-09_2008.pdf |archivedate=23 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbol of the city is the [[Ljubljana Dragon]]. It is depicted on the top of the tower of [[Ljubljana Castle]] in the Ljubljana coat of arms and on the Ljubljanica-crossing [[Dragon Bridge (Ljubljana)|Dragon Bridge]] ({{lang|sl|Zmajski most}}).&lt;ref name="ARCH124"&gt;{{cite book|author=C Abdunur |title=ARCH'01: Troisième conferénce internationale sur les ponts en arc |publisher=Presses des Ponts |location= |year=2001 |page=124 |isbn=978-2-85978-347-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It symbolizes power, courage, and greatness.

There are several explanations on the origin of the Ljubljana Dragon. According to a [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]] myth, the slaying of a dragon releases the waters and ensures the fertility of the earth, and it is thought that the myth is tied to the [[Ljubljana Marshes]], the expansive marshy area that periodically threatens Ljubljana with flooding.&lt;ref name="Exhib_2010"&gt;[http://www.mgml.si/media/katalog_9_5.pdf Exhibition catalogue Emona: myth and reality] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105154411/http://www.mgml.si/media/katalog_9_5.pdf |date=5 November 2013 }}; Museum and Galleries of Ljubljana 2010&lt;/ref&gt; According to the celebrated [[Greek mythology|Greek legend]], the [[Argonauts]] on their return home after having taken the [[Golden Fleece]] found a large lake surrounded by a marsh between the present-day towns of [[Vrhnika]] and Ljubljana. It was there that [[Jason]] struck down a monster. This monster has evolved into the [[dragon]] that today is present in the city coat of arms and flag.&lt;ref name="InfoDragon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ljubljana.si/en/about-ljubljana/images-of-ljubljana/ |title=The dragon – city emblem |accessdate=2 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907174416/http://www.ljubljana.si/en/about-ljubljana/images-of-ljubljana/ |archive-date=7 September 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is historically more believable that the dragon was adopted from [[Saint George]], the patron of the Ljubljana Castle chapel built in the 15th century. In the legend of [[Saint George]], the dragon represents the old ancestral [[paganism]] overcome by [[Christianity]]. According to another explanation, related to the second, the dragon was at first only a decoration above the city coat of arms. In the [[Baroque]], it became part of the coat of arms, and in the 19th and especially the 20th century, it outstripped the tower and other elements in importance.

{{see also|Timeline of Ljubljana}}

===Prehistory===
Around 2000 BC, the [[Ljubljana Marshes]] in the immediate vicinity of Ljubljana were settled by people living in [[stilt house|pile dwellings]]. [[Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps|Prehistoric pile dwellings]] and [[Ljubljana Marshes Wooden Wheel|the oldest wooden wheel in the world]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ljubljanskobarje.si/unesco-na-ljubljanskem-barju/najstarejse-kolo-z-osjo-na-svetu|title=Najstarejše kolo z osjo na svetu – 5150 let|first=|last=novisplet.com|date=|work=ljubljanskobarje.si}}&lt;/ref&gt; are among the most notable archeological findings from the marshland. These [[Pile-dwelling culture of the Ljubljana Marshes|lake-dwelling people]] lived through hunting, fishing and primitive agriculture. To get around the marshes, they used [[dugout canoe]]s made by cutting out the inside of tree trunks. Their archeological remains, nowadays in the [[Municipality of Ig]], have been designated a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] since June 2011, in the [[Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps|common nomination of six Alpine states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ukom.gov.si/en/media_room/newsletter_slovenia_news/news/article/391/2809/1e33cc2ffd/?tx_ttnews&amp;#91;newsletter&amp;#93;=114 |title=Prehistoric Pile Dwellings Listed as UNESCO World Heritage |publisher=Government Communication Office |work=Slovenia News |date=28 June 2011 |access-date=28 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427203207/http://www.ukom.gov.si/en/media_room/newsletter_slovenia_news/news/article/391/2809/1e33cc2ffd/?tx_ttnews&amp;#91;newsletter&amp; |archive-date=27 April 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washington.embassy.si/fileadmin/user_upload/dkp_51_vwa/newsletter/october_2011/Embassy_s_Newsletter__2011_-_14_-_10_finale.pdf |title=Pile-dwellings in the Ljubljansko Barje on UNESCO List |journal=Embassy Newsletter |publisher=Embassy of Slovenia in Washington |date=14 October 2011 |editor=Maša Štiftar de Arzu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the area remained a transit point for numerous tribes and peoples, among them the [[Illyrians]], followed by a mixed nation of the [[Celts]] and the Illyrians called the [[Iapydes]], and then in the 3rd century BC a Celtic tribe, the [[Taurisci]].&lt;ref name="Histo1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ljubljana.si/en/about-ljubljana/history/first-settlers/ |title=First settlers |accessdate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318073218/http://www.ljubljana.si/en/about-ljubljana/history/first-settlers/ |archivedate=18 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
The parchment sheet ''Nomina defunctorum'' ("Names of the Dead"), most probably written in the second half of 1161, mentions the nobleman Rudolf of Tarcento, a lawyer of the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia (Episcopal)|Patriarchate of Aquileia]], who had bestowed a canon with 20 farmsteads beside the [[Ljubljana Castle|castle of Ljubljana]] (''castrum Leibach'') to the Patriarchate.

From 1529, Ljubljana had an active [[Protestant Reformation#Slovene Lands|Slovene Protestant community]]. After they were expelled in 1598, marking the beginning of the [[Counter-Reformation]], Catholic Bishop [[Thomas Chrön]] ordered the public burning of eight cartloads of Protestant books.&lt;ref name="ES"&gt;Rajhman, Jože, &amp; Emilijan Cevc. 1990.

In 1597, [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] arrived in the city, followed in 1606 by the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]], to [[Counter-Reformation|eradicate Protestantism]]. Only 5% of all the residents of Ljubljana at the time were of Catholic confession, so it took quite a while to make it Catholic again. Jesuits organized the first theatrical productions in the town, fostered the development of [[Baroque music]] and established Catholic schools. In the middle and the second half of the 17th century, foreign architects built and renovated numerous monasteries, churches, and palaces in Ljubljana and introduced [[Baroque architecture]]. In 1702, the [[Ursulines]] settled in the town, where, the following year, they opened the first public school for girls in the [[Slovene Lands]]. Some years later, the construction of [[Ursuline Church of the Holy Trinity]] started.&lt;ref name="RKD1980"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://giskd2s.situla.org/rkd/Opis.asp?Esd=1980 |title=1980: Ljubljana – Cerkev sv.

==Cityscape==
The city's architecture is a mix of styles. Despite the appearance of large buildings, especially at the city's edge, Ljubljana's historic center remains intact. Although the oldest architecture has been preserved from the Roman period, Ljubljana's downtown got its outline in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-5GMVBYIJ/ |title=Stavbni razvoj v Ljubljani (1144–1895) in arhivsko gradivo Zgodovinskega arhiva Ljubljana |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Architectural Development of Ljubljana (1144–1895) and the Archives of the Historical Archives of Ljubljana |first=Jože |last=Suhadolnik |year=1994 |volume=42 |issn=0023-4923 |journal=Kronika: časopis za slovensko krajevno zgodovino [The Chronicle: the Newspaper for the Slovenian History of Places] }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[1511 Western Slovenia earthquake|1511 earthquake]], it was rebuilt in the [[Baroque|Baroque style]] following Italian, particularly Venetian, models. 

After the quake in 1895, it was once again rebuilt, this time in the [[Vienna Secession]] style, which today is juxtaposed against the earlier Baroque style buildings that remain.

===Main sights===
The central square in Ljubljana is [[Prešeren Square]] ({{lang|sl|Prešernov trg}}) where the [[Franciscan Church of the Annunciation]] ({{lang|sl|Frančiškanska cerkev}}) is located. Built between 1646 and 1660 (the belltowers following later), it replaced an older Gothic church on the same site. The layout takes the form of an early-Baroque basilica with one nave and two rows of lateral chapels. The Baroque main altar was executed by the sculptor Francesco Robba. Much of the original frescos were ruined by the cracks in the ceiling caused by the [[1895 Ljubljana earthquake|Ljubljana earthquake in 1895]]. The new frescos were painted by the Slovene [[impressionist]] painter [[Matej Sternen]].

Existing already in the 18th century, the Ljubljana central square, the [[Prešeren Square (Ljubljana)|Prešeren Square]]'s modern appearance has developed since the end of the 19th century. After the 1895 earthquake, [[Max Fabiani]] designed the square as the hub of four streets and four banks, and in the 1980s, [[Edvard Ravnikar]] proposed the circular design and the granite block pavement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slovenia.info/?arhitekturne_znamenitosti=765&amp;lng=1 |title=Ljubljana, Tromostovje |work=WWW.slovenia.info |publisher=Slovenian Tourist Board |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-YLJCEM5D/ |title=Prešernov trg v Ljubljani |first=Breda |last=Mihelič |language=Slovenian, English|trans-title=Prešeren Square in Ljubljana |journal=Zbornik za umetnostno zgodovino [Collection of Art History Papers] |year=1999 |volume=35 |pages=94–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of the Slovene [[List of national poets|national poet]] [[France Prešeren]] with a [[muse]] stands in the middle of the square.

====The Triple Bridge====
[[File:Ljubljana in Ljubljanica.jpg|thumb|The scenic Triple Bridge, decorated with stone balusters and stone lamps on all of the three bridges.]]
The [[Triple Bridge]] is decorated with stone [[baluster]]s and stone lamps on all of the three bridges and leads to the terraces looking on the river and poplar trees. It occupies a central point on the east-west axis, connecting the [[Tivoli City Park]] with [[Rožnik Hill]], on one side, and the [[Ljubljana Castle]] on the other,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitljubljana.com/en/directory/sights-attractions/1821/detail.html |title=Triple Bridge |work=Www.visitljubljana.com |accessdate=15 May 2012 |publisher=Ljubljana Tourism}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the north-south axis through the city, represented by the river. It was enlarged in order to prevent the historically single bridge  from being a [[Bottleneck (traffic)|bottleneck]] by adding two side [[pedestrian]] bridges to the middle one. 

====The Fish Footbridge====
The Fish Footbridge offers a good view of the neighbouring Triple Bridge to the north and the Cobbler's Bridge to the south of it. It is a transparent glass-made bridge, which is illuminated at night by in-built LEDs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fleetwoodurban.com.au/inspiration/global/ribja-brv-girder Ribja brv Girder Bridge], www.fleetwoodurban.com.au,&lt;/ref&gt; From 1991 to 2014 the bridge was a wooden one and decorated with flowers, while since its reconstruction in 2014, it is made of glass. It was planned already in 1895 by [[Maks Fabiani]] to build a bridge on the location, in 1913 [[Alfred Keller]] planned a staircase, later [[Jože Plečnik]] incorporated both into his own plans which, however, were not realised.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rtvslo.si/kultura/drugo/ribja-brv-v-novi-preobleki/347367 Ribja brv v novi 'preobleki'], MMC RTV Slovenia, September 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Cobbler's Bridge====

The 1930 ‘Cobblers’ Bridge’ ({{lang|sl|Šuštarski}}, from German {{lang|de|Schuster}} – Shoemaker) is another [[Plečnik]]'s creation, connecting two major areas of medieval Ljubljana. It is decorated by two kinds of pillars, the [[Corinthian pillar]]s which delineate the shape of the bridge itself and the [[Ionic order|Ionic pillars]] as lamp-bearers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kongres-magazine.eu/2017/05/cobblers-bridge-cevljarski-most/&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

====The Trnovo Bridge====
[[File:Trnovo_Bridge.jpg|thumb|Trnovo Bridge]]
The Trnovo Bridge is the most prominent object of Plečnik's renovation of the banks of the Gradaščica. It is located in the front of the [[Trnovo Church]] to the south of the city center. It connects the neighborhoods of [[Krakovo]] and [[Trnovo, Ljubljana|Trnovo]], the oldest Ljubljana suburbs, known for their market gardens and cultural events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chapter: The Suburbs of Krakovo and Trnovo |page=30 |work=Ljubljana Tourist Guide |publisher=Ljubljana Tourism |url=http://issuu.com/visitljubljana/docs/ljubljana-tourist-guide?mode=window&amp;pageNumber=30 |date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built between 1929 and 1932. It is distinguished by its width and two rows of [[birch]]es that it bears, because it was meant to serve as a public space in front of the church. Each corner of the bridge is capped with a small pyramid, a signature motif of Plečnik's, whereas the mid-span features a pair of [[Art-Deco]] male sculptures. There is also a statue of [[John the Baptist|Saint John the Baptist]] on the bridge, the patron of the Trnovo Church. It was designed by {{nowrap|[[Nikolaj Pirnat]]}}.

[[File:NationalGallery-Ljubljana.JPG|thumb|left|Main building of the Slovenian National Gallery]]
Ljubljana has numerous [[art museum|art galleries]] and museums. The first purpose-built art gallery in Ljubljana was the [[Jakopič Pavilion]], which was in the first half of the 20th century the central exhibition venue of Slovene artists. In the early 1960s, it was succeeded by the [[Ljubljana City Art Gallery]], which has presented a number of modern Slovene and foreign artists. In 2010, there were 14 museums and 56 art galleries in Ljubljana.&lt;ref name="InNumbers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ljubljana.si/en/about-ljubljana/ljubljana-in-numbers/ |title=Ljubljana in Figures |publisher=City Municipality of Ljubljana |accessdate=23 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419120715/http://www.ljubljana.si/en/about-ljubljana/ljubljana-in-numbers |archivedate=19 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is for example an architecture museum, [[Slovenian Railway Museum|a railway museum]], a school museum, a sports museum, a museum of modern art, a museum of contemporary art, a [[Pivovarna Union|brewery museum]], the [[Slovenian Museum of Natural History]] and the Slovene Ethnographic Museum.&lt;ref name="Pointinteret"/&gt; The [[National Gallery of Slovenia|National Gallery]] ({{lang|sl|Narodna galerija}}), founded in 1918,&lt;ref name="Histo5"/&gt; and the [[Museum of Modern Art (Ljubljana)|Museum of Modern Art]] ({{lang|sl|Moderna galerija}}) exhibit the [[List of Slovenian artists|most influential Slovenian artists]].

===Entertainment and performing arts===
[[File:Ljubljanska Opera 2.jpg|thumb|The front of the [[Slovene National Opera and Ballet Theatre|Opera and Ballet Theatre]]]]
[[File:SNG-Drama-Ljubljana.JPG|thumb|The Slovenian National Theatre]]
[[Cankar Hall]] is the largest Slovenian cultural and congress center with multiple halls and a large foyer in which art film festivals, artistic performances, book fairs, and other cultural events are held.

====Cinema====
The cinema in Ljubljana appeared for the first time at the turn of the 20th century, and quickly gained popularity among the residents. After World War II, the [[Cinema Company Ljubljana]], later named ''Ljubljana Cinematographers'', was established and managed a number of already functioning movie theaters in Ljubljana, including the only Yugoslav children's theater. A number of cinema festivals took place in the 1960s, and a [[cinematheque]] opened its doors in 1963. With the advent of television, video, and recently the Internet, most cinema theaters in Ljubljana closed, and the cinema mainly moved to [[Kolosej]], a [[multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] in the [[BTC City]]. It features twelve screens, including an [[IMAX 3D]] screen. The remaining theaters are [[Kino Komuna]], [[Kinodvor]], where art movies are accompanied by events, and the [[Slovenian Cinematheque]].

====Classical music, opera and ballet====
The [[Slovenian Philharmonics]] is the central music institution in Ljubljana and Slovenia. It holds [[classical music]] concerts of domestic and foreign performers as well as educates youth. It was established in 1701 as part of [[Academia operosorum Labacensis]] and is among the oldest such institutions in Europe. The [[Slovene National Opera and Ballet Theatre]] also resides in Ljubljana, presenting a wide variety of domestic and foreign, modern and classic, opera, ballet and concert works. It serves as the national opera and ballet house. Numerous music festivals are held in Ljubljana, chiefly in [[Classical music|European classical music]] and jazz, for instance the [[Ljubljana Summer Festival]] ({{lang|sl|Ljubljanski poletni festival}}), and [[Trnfest]].

====Theater====
In addition to the main houses, with the [[Slovene National Theatre, Ljubljana|SNT Drama Ljubljana]] as the most important among them, a number of small producers are active in Ljubljana, involved primarily in [[physical theatre]] (e.g. [[Betontanc]]), [[street theatre]] (e.g. [[Ana Monró Theatre]]), [[theatresports]] championship [[Impro League]], and [[improvisational theatre]] (e.g. [[IGLU Theatre]]). A popular form is [[puppetry]], mainly performed in the [[Ljubljana Puppet Theatre]]. Theater has a rich tradition in Ljubljana, starting with the 1867 first ever Slovene-language drama performance.

====Modern dance====
The [[modern dance]] was presented in Ljubljana for the first time at the end of the 19th century and developed rapidly since the end of the 1920s. Since the 1930s when in Ljubljana was founded a [[Mary Wigman]] dance school, the first one for modern dance in Slovenia, the field has been intimately linked to the development in Europe and the United States. [[Ljubljana Dance Theatre]] is today the only venue in Ljubljana dedicated to [[contemporary dance]]. Despite this, there's a vivid happening in the field.

====Folk dance====
Several [[folk dance]] groups are active in Ljubljana.

====Jazz====
In July 2015, over four days, the 56th Ljubljana Jazz Festival took place. A member of the European Jazz Network, the festival presented 19 concerts featuring artists from 19 countries, including a celebration of the 75th anniversary of [[James Blood Ulmer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europejazz.net/articles/ljubljana-jazz-festival-july-2015|title=Ljubljana Jazz Festival – July 2015 – Europe Jazz Network|author=|date=|work=europejazz.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Metelkova and Rog
A Ljubljana equivalent of the Copenhagen's [[Freetown Christiania]], a self-proclaimed autonomous [[Metelkova]] neighbourhood, was set up in a former Austro-Hungarian barracks that were built in 1882 (completed in 1911).&lt;ref name="Metelkova"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ljubljana-life.com/ljubljana/metelkova | title=Metelkova |publisher=ljubljana-life.com |accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Metelkova mesto"&gt;{{cite web | title=Metelkova mesto |publisher=culture.si |accessdate=23 September 2018| url=https://www.culture.si/en/Metelkova_mesto_Autonomous_Cultural_Zone }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the seven buildings and 12,500 m2 of space were turned into art galleries, artist studios, and seven nightclubs, including two LGBTQ+ venues, playing host to all range of music from hardcore to jazz to dub to techno. Adjacent to the Metelkova are located the [[Celica Hostel]]&lt;ref name="CelicaHostel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ljubljana-life.com/sleep/hotels_details/9-Celica_Hostel |title=Celica Hostel |accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with rooms all artistically decorated by the Metelkova artists, and a new part of the Museum of Modern Art, [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Ljubljana|Museum of Contemporary Art]].&lt;ref name="CalgaryHerald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theprovince.com/travel/Ljubljana+easy+love+explore/6912326/story.html |title=Lovely Ljubljana; Its name is hard to pronounce, but the city's easy to love and explore |publisher=[[The Calgary Herald]] |date=21 July 2012 |accessdate=7 August 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another alternative culture center is located in the former [[Rog (factory)|Rog factory]]. Both [[Metelkova]] and [[Rog (factory)|Rog factory]] factory located in [[Tabor, Ljubljana|Tabor]] neighborhood are walking distance from the city centre and visited by various tours.

;Šiška Cultural Quarter
The [[Šiška Cultural Quarter]] hosts a number of art groups and cultural organisations dedicated to contemporary and avant-garde arts. Part of it is also [[Kino Šiška Center for Urban Culture]], a venue where music concerts of indie, punk, and rock bands as well as exhibitions take place. [[Museum of Transitory Art]] (MoTA) is a museum without a permanent collection or a fixed space. Instead, its programs are realised in different locations and contexts in temporary physical and virtual spaces dedicated to advancing the research, production and presentation of transitory, experimental, and live art forms. Yearly MoTA organizes Sonica Festival. [[Ljudmila (hackerspace)|Ljudmila]] (since 1994) strives to connect research practices, technologies, science, and art.

==Sports==
===Clubs===
A tension between German and Slovene residents dominated the development of sport of Ljubljana in the 19th century. The first sport club in Ljubljana was the [[South Sokol Gymnastic Club]] ({{lang|sl|Gimnastično društvo Južni Sokol}}), established in 1863 and succeeded in 1868 by the [[Ljubljana Sokol]] ({{lang|sl|Ljubljanski Sokol}}). It was the parent club of all Slovene [[Sokol]] clubs as well as an encouragement for the establishment of the [[Croatian Sokol]] club in Zagreb. Members were also active in culture and politics, striving for greater integration of the Slovenes from different Crown lands of [[Austria–Hungary]] and for their cultural, political, and economic independence.

In 1885, German residents established the first sports club in the territory of nowadays Slovenia, {{lang|de|[[Der Laibacher Byciklistischer Club]]}} (''Ljubljana Cycling Club''). In 1887, Slovene cyclists established the [[Slovene Cyclists Club]] ({{lang|sl|Slovenski biciklistični klub}}). In 1893 followed the first Slovene [[Alpine club]], named [[Slovene Alpine Club]] ({{lang|sl|Slovensko planinsko društvo}}), later succeeded by the [[Alpine Association of Slovenia]] ({{lang|sl|Planinska zveza Slovenije}}). Several of its branches operate in Ljubljana, the largest of them being the [[Ljubljana Matica Alpine Club]] ({{lang|sl|Planinsko društvo Ljubljana-Matica}}). In 1900, the sports club {{lang|de|Laibacher Sportverein}} (English: ''Ljubljana Sports Club'') was established by the city's German residents and functioned until 1909. In 1906, Slovenes organized themselves in its Slovene counterpart, the Ljubljana Sports Club ({{lang|sl|Ljubljanski športni klub}}). Its members were primarily interested in [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], but also swimming and football. In 1911, the first Slovene football club, ''[[ND Ilirija|Ilirija]]'', started operating in the city. Winter sports started to develop in the area of the nowadays Ljubljana already before World War II.&lt;ref name="SDDolomiti2012-01-05"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sddolomiti.si/?page_id=172 |title=Zgodovina |trans-title=History |publisher=Sports Club Dolomiti |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, the first [[ice hockey]] club in Slovenia (then Yugoslavia) [[HDD Olimpija Ljubljana|SK Ilirija]] was established.

Nowadays, the city's [[Association football|football]] team which plays in the [[Slovenian PrvaLiga]] is [[NK Olimpija Ljubljana (2005)|NK Olimpija Ljubljana]]. Ljubljana's [[ice hockey]] clubs are [[HK Slavija Ljubljana|HK Slavija]] and [[HK Olimpija]]. They both compete in the [[Slovenian Ice Hockey League|Slovenian Hockey League]]. The basketball teams are [[KD Slovan]] and [[KK Olimpija]]. The latter, which has a green dragon as its mascot, hosts its matches at the 12,480-seat [[Arena Stožice]] since 2010. Handball is more or less popular in female section. [[RK Krim]] is one of the best women handball team in Europe. They won [[EHF Champions League]] twice, also 2nd and 3rd places are not a rare thing.  [[AMTK Ljubljana]] is the most successful [[motorcycle speedway|speedway]] club in Slovenia. The Ljubljana Sports Club has been succeeded by the [[Livada Canoe and Kayak Club]].&lt;ref name="Habič1997SPM"&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.geopedia.si/?params=T105_L7452_F1327#T105_L7452_F1327_x462354_y99219_s17_b4 |chapter=Ljubljanica se leno vije proti mestu |trans-chapter=The Ljubljanica River, as It Winds Lazily Towards the Town |title=Prestolnica Ljubljana nekoč in danes |trans-title=A Pictorial Chronicle of a Capital City |work=Geopedia.si |first=Marko |last=Habič |publisher=National Publishing House of Slovenia |year=1997 |isbn=978-86-341-2007-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
===Primary education===
In Ljubljana today there are over 50 public elementary schools with over 20,000 pupils.&lt;ref name="InNumbers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Ljubljana"/&gt; This also includes an [[international school|international]] elementary school for foreign pupils. There are two private elementary schools: a [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]] elementary school and a [[Catholic school|Catholic]] elementary school. In addition, there are several elementary music schools.

Historically the first school in Ljubljana belonged to [[Teutonic Knights]] and was established in the 13th century. It originally accepted only boys; girls were accepted from the beginning of the 16th century. [[Parochial school]]s are attested in the 13th century, at [[St. Peter's Parish Church (Ljubljana)|St. Peter's Church]] and at Saint Nicholas's Church, the later Ljubljana Cathedral. Since 1291, there were also trade-oriented private schools in Ljubljana. In the beginning of the 17th century, there were six schools in Ljubljana and later three. A girls' school was established by [[Poor Clares]], followed in 1703 by the [[Ursulines]]. Their school was for about 170 years the only public girls' school in [[Carniola]]. These schools were mainly private or established by the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-5MPOYPTA/ |title=Ljubljansko ljudsko šolstvo v terezijanski in jožefinski dobi |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Ljubljana People's Schools in the Era of Theresian and Josef's Era |journal=Kronika slovenskih mest [The Chronicle of Slovenian Cities] |first=Dostal |last=Rudolf |year=1939 |volume=6 |publisher=City Municipality of Ljubljana |pages=21–28; 33–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1775, the Austrian Empress [[Maria Theresa]] proclaimed [[elementary education]] obligatory and Ljubljana got its [[normal school#Europe|normal school]], intended as a learning place for teachers. In 1805, the first state [[music school]] was established in Ljubljana. In the time of [[Illyrian Provinces]], "''école primaire''", a unified four-year elementary school program with a greater emphasis on Slovene, was introduced. The first public schools, unrelated to religious education, appeared in 1868.

===Secondary education===
[[File:Realka-Ljubljana.JPG|thumb|left|The first complete Realschule (technical grammar school) was established in Ljubljana in 1871.]]
Currently in Ljubljana there are ten public and three private [[grammar school]]s. The public schools divide into general [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]] and [[Classical gymnasium|classical]] gymnasiums, the latter offering Latin and Greek as foreign languages. Some general schools offer internationally oriented European departments, and some offer sport departments, allowing students to more easily adjust their sport and school obligations. All state schools are free, but the number of students they can accept is limited. The private secondary schools include a Catholic grammar school and a Waldorf grammar school. There are also professional grammar schools in Ljubljana, offering economical, technical, or artistic subjects (visual arts, music). All grammar schools last four years and conclude with the [[matura]] exam.

Historically, upon a proposal by [[Primož Trubar]], the [[Carniolan Estates' School]] (1563–1598) was established in 1563 in the period of [[Slovene Reformation]]. Its teaching languages were mainly [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], but also [[German language|German]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]], and it was open for both sexes and all social strata. In 1597, [[Jesuit]]s established the [[Laibach Jesuit College|Jesuit College]] (1597–1773), intended to transmit general education. In 1773, secondary education came under the control of the state. A number of reforms were implemented in the 19th century; there was more emphasis on general knowledge and religious education was removed from state secondary schools. In 1910, there were 29 secondary schools in Ljubljana, among them classical and real gymnasiums and [[Realschule]]s (technical secondary schools).

===Tertiary education===
[[File:University of Ljubljana Palace.jpg|thumb|left|The main building of the [[University of Ljubljana]], formerly the seat of the Carniolan Parliament]]
In 2011, the University had 23 faculties and three academies, located in different parts of Ljubljana. They offer Slovene-language courses in medicine, [[applied science]]s, arts, law, administration, natural sciences, and other subjects.&lt;ref name="Université Ljubljana II"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-lj.si/en/about_university_of_ljubljana/statues_of_ul.aspx |title=Statutes of UL |accessdate=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university has more than 63,000 students and some 4,000 teaching faculty.&lt;ref name="University of Ljubljana"/&gt; Students make up one-seventh of Ljubljana's population, giving the city a youthful character.&lt;ref name="University of Ljubljana"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-lj.si/en/about_university_of_ljubljana/university_of_ljubljana.aspx |title=University of Ljubljana |first=|last=University of Ljubljana |work=uni-lj.si |year=2011 |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Université Ljubljana"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-lj.si/en/about_university_of_ljubljana/ul_history.aspx |title=UL history |accessdate=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, higher schools offering the study of general medicine, surgery, architecture, law and theology, started to operate in Ljubljana during the [[French occupation of the Slovene Lands]], in 1810–11. Austro-Hungarian Empire never allowed Slovenes to establish their own university in Ljubljana and the [[University of Ljubljana]], Slovenia's most important university, was founded in 1919 after Slovenes joined the first Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="Histo5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Ljubljana"/&gt; When it was founded, the university comprised five faculties: law, philosophy, technology, theology and medicine. From the beginning, the seat of the university has been at [[Congress Square]] in a building that served as the State Mansion of Carniola from 1902 to 1918.

===Libraries===

;Central Technological Library
The second largest university library in Ljubljana is the [[Central Technological Library]], the national library and information hub for natural sciences and technology.

;Municipal Library and other libraries
The Municipal [[City Library of Ljubljana]], established in&amp;nbsp;2008, is the central regional library and the largest Slovenian general public library. In&amp;nbsp;2011, it held 1,657,000 volumes, among these 1,432,000 books and a multitude of other resources in 36 branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mklj.si/eng/index.php/about/statistics |title=Statistics |publisher=City Municipality of Ljubljana |accessdate=14 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430023409/http://www.mklj.si/eng/index.php/about/statistics |archivedate=30 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, there are 5&amp;nbsp;general public libraries and over 140&amp;nbsp;specialized libraries in Ljubljana.&lt;ref name="InNumbers"/&gt;

Besides the two largest university libraries there are a number of libraries at individual faculties, departments and institutes of the [[University of Ljubljana]]. The largest among them are the [[Central Humanist Library of the Faculty of Arts|Central Humanist Library]] in the field of [[humanities]], the [[Central Social Sciences Library of the Faculty of Social Sciences, Ljubljana|Central Social Sciences Library]], the [[Central Economic Library]] in the field of [[economics]], the [[Central Medical Library]] in the field of [[medical sciences]], and the [[Libraries of the Biotechnical Faculty]] in the field of [[biology]] and [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-lj.si/en/en/libraries/libraries_at_ul/the_organisation_and_activities_of_the_ul_libraries.aspx |title=The Organisation and Activities of the UL Libraries |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;History
The first libraries in Ljubljana were located in [[monastery|monasteries]]. The first public library was the [[Carniolan Estates' Library]], established in&amp;nbsp;1569 by Primož Trubar. In the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, the [[Jesuit library, Ljubljana|Jesuit Library]] collected numerous works, particularly about mathematics. In&amp;nbsp;1707, the [[Seminary Library, Ljubljana|Seminary Library]] was established; it is the first and oldest public scientific library in Slovenia. Around&amp;nbsp;1774, after the dissolution of Jesuits, the [[Lyceum Library, Ljubljana|Lyceum Library]] was formed from the remains of the Jesuit Library as well as several monastery libraries.

==Science==
The first society of the leading scientists and public workers in Carniola was the [[Dismas Fraternity]] (Latin: {{lang|la|Societas Unitorum}}), formed in Ljubljana in 1688.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umzg.zrc-sazu.si/?q=/node/264 |title=Lavric AHAS 6 &amp;#124; Umetnostnozgodovinski inštitut Franceta Steleta |publisher=Umzg.zrc-sazu.si |accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1693, the ''[[Academia Operosorum Labacensium]]'' was founded and lasted with an interruption until the end of the 18th century. The next academy in Ljubljana, the [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], was not established until 1938.

===City bus===
[[File:Mercedes-Benz O405GN2 LPP 206.jpg|thumb|Older type of city bus on the streets of Ljubljana]]
The [[Ljubljana Bus Station]], the Ljubljana central bus hub, is located next to the Ljubljana railway station. The city bus network, run by the [[Ljubljana Passenger Transport]] (''LPP'') company, is Ljubljana's most widely used means of [[public transport]]. The fleet is relatively modern. The number of dedicated bus lines is limited, which can cause problems in peak hours when traffic becomes congested.&lt;ref name="ECORYS2011"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docgener/evaluation/pdf/evasltrat_tran/slovenia.pdf |chapter=Situation per mode of transport |title=Study on Strategic Evaluation on Transport Investment Priorities under Structural and Cohesion funds for the Programming Period 2007–2013 |date=August 2006 |publisher=ECORYS Nederland BV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bus rides may be paid with the [[Urbana (payment card)|Urbana payment card]] (also used for the funicular) or with a [[mobile payment|mobile phone]]. Sometimes the buses are called ''trole'' (referring to [[trolley pole]]s), harking back to the 1951–71 days when Ljubljana had [[trolleybus]] (''trolejbus'') service.&lt;ref name="Izgubljena"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dnevnik.si/tiskane_izdaje/dnevnik/1042403604 |title=Izgubljena Ljubljana |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Lost Ljubljana |first=Nenad |last=Pataky |newspaper=Dnevnik |date=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were five [[Ljubljana trolleybus system|trolleybus lines in Ljubljana]], until 1958 alongside the tram.&lt;ref name="Nebec"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.bb-kranj.si/doc/diplome/Nebec_Damjan-Analiza_placilnega_sistema_v_LPP.pdf |title=Analiza plačilnega sistema v LPP |language=Slovenian, German |trans-title=An Analysis of the Payment System in the LPP |first=Damjan |last=Nebec |publisher=B&amp;B education and training |date=March 2010 |pages=10–11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803073742/http://www.bb-kranj.si/doc/diplome/Nebec_Damjan-Analiza_placilnega_sistema_v_LPP.pdf |archivedate=3 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are numerous taxi companies in the city.

Another means of public road transport in the city center is the Cavalier ({{lang|sl|Kavalir}}), an electric vehicle operated by LPP since May 2009. There are three such vehicles in Ljubljana. The ride is free and there are no stations because it can be stopped anywhere. It can carry up to five passengers; most of them are elderly people and tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ljubljana.si/en/municipality/news/71679/detail.html |title='The Cavalier' on the Streets of Ljubljana |date=30 March 2011 |publisher=City Municipality of Ljubljana |work=Ljubljana.si |access-date=24 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910000733/http://www.ljubljana.si/en/municipality/news/71679/detail.html |archive-date=10 September 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cavalier drives in the car-free zone in the Ljubljana downtown. The first line links [[Čop Street]], [[Wolf Street]] and the [[Hribar Embankment]], whereas the second links [[Town Square (Ljubljana)|Town Square]], [[Upper Square (Ljubljana)|Upper Square]], and [[Old Square (Ljubljana)|Old Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ljubljana.si/si/mol/novice/2106/detail.html |title=Naj vas zapelje Kavalir |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Let the Cavalier Drive You |date=13 May 2009 |publisher=City Municipality of Ljubljana |work=Ljubljana.si}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a tractor with wagons decorated to look like a train for tourists in Ljubljana, linking [[Cyril and Methodius Square]] in the city center with Ljubljana Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slovenia.info/?ogledi=466&amp;lng=1 |title=Turistični vlakec na Ljubljanski grad |language=Slovenian |trans-title=A Tourist Train to Ljubljana Castle |work=Slovenia.info |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bicycles===
[[File:BicikeLJ Ljubljana-Prešernov trg.JPG|thumb|[[BicikeLJ]], a Ljubljana-based self-service bicycle network, is free of charge for the first hour.]]
There is a considerable amount of [[bicycle]] traffic in Ljubljana, especially in the warmer months of the year. It is also possible to rent a bike. Since May 2011, the [[BicikeLJ]], a self-service [[Bicycle sharing system|bicycle rental]] system offers the residents and visitors of Ljubljana 510 bicycles and more than 600 parking spots at 51 stations in the wider city center area. The daily number of rentals is around 2,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sta.si/vest.php?s=a&amp;id=1659068 |title=Ljubljana Rent-a-Bike Network Gaining in Popularity |date=24 July 2011 |publisher=STA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sta.si/en/vest.php?id=1635721 |title=Ljubljana Launches Public Bike Project |date=14 May 2011 |publisher=STA}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a possibility to rent a bike even before the establishment of BicikeLJ.&lt;ref name="Transvelo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ljubljana.si/en/tourist_services/lj-bike/default.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009205059/http://www.ljubljana.si/en/tourist_services/lj-bike/default.html |archivedate=9 October 2007 |title=Ljubljana Bike |accessdate=31 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are still some conditions for cyclists in Ljubljana that have been criticized as unfortunate to date. This refers to cycle lanes in poor condition and constructed in a way that motorized traffic is privileged. There are also many one-way streets which therefore cannot be used as alternate routes so it is difficult to legally travel by bicycle through the city center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delo.si/novice/slovenija/razvajati-kolesarje-ne-avtomobiliste.html/ |author= Mateja Gruden |title=Delo (17. julij 2000): Razvajati kolesarje, ne avtomobiliste |publisher=delo.si |date=25 March 2012 |accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kolesarji.org/peticija-za-fabianijev-most/ |author=Ljubljanska kolesarska mreža |title=Peticija za Fabianijev most |publisher=kolesarji.org |date=12 June 2012 |accessdate=24 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824211642/https://kolesarji.org/peticija-za-fabianijev-most/ |archivedate=24 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through years, some prohibitions have been partially abolished by marking [[cycle lane]]s on the pavement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200029/clanek/i-kuscer/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010504065527/http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200029/clanek/i-kuscer/ |archivedate=4 May 2001 |title=Mladina (17. julij 2000): Kolesarski zmaji |date=9 January 2008 |accessdate=10 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lkm.kolesarji.org/besedila/LKM%20pobude%20za%20prijazno%20kolesarsko%20infrastrukturo.pdf |title=Ljubljanska kolesarska mreža (okt. 2010): Pobude za izboljšave v Ljubljanski kolesarski infrastrukturi, str. 2 |format=PDF |accessdate=10 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820050256/http://lkm.kolesarji.org/besedila/LKM%20pobude%20za%20prijazno%20kolesarsko%20infrastrukturo.pdf |archivedate=20 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the situation has been steadily improving; in 2015, Ljubljana placed 13th in a ranking of the world's most bicycle-friendly cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sloveniatimes.com/survey-ranks-ljubljana-world-s-13th-most-bicycle-friendly-city|title= Survey Ranks Ljubljana World's 13th Most Bicycle-Friendly City|accessdate=30 June 2015 |date=30 June 2015 |work=Slovenia Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Ljubljana was already 8th on the Copenhagenize list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://copenhagenizeindex.eu/08_ljubljana.html|title= copenhagenizeindex |publisher=copenhagenizeindex.eu |date=21 June 2018 |accessdate=21 June 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water transport===
The river transport on the Ljubljanica and the Sava was the main means of cargo transport to and from the city until the mid-19th century, when railroads were built. Today, the Ljubljanica is used by a number of tourist ships, with wharves under the [[Butchers' Bridge]], at [[Fish Square, Ljubljana|Fish Square]], at [[Court Square, Ljubljana|Court Square]], at [[Breg, Ljubljana|Breg]], at the [[Poljane Embankment]], and elsewhere.

==Healthcare==
Ljubljana has a rich history of discoveries in medicine and innovations in medical technology. The majority of [[secondary care|secondary]] and [[tertiary care]] in Slovenia takes place in Ljubljana. The [[Ljubljana University Medical Centre|Ljubljana University Medical Center]] is the largest hospital center in Slovenia. The [[Faculty of Medicine, Ljubljana|Faculty of Medicine]] (University of Ljubljana) and the [[Ljubljana Institute of Oncology]] are other two central medical institutions in Slovenia. The [[Ljubljana Community Health Center]] is the largest [[health center]] in Slovenia. It has seven units at 11 locations. Since 1986, Ljubljana is part of the [[Healthy city|WHO European Healthy Cities Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ljubljana.si/si/mol/mestna-uprava/oddelki/zdravje-socialno-varstvo/organizacijske-enote-v-sestavi/ |title=Organizacijske enote v sestavi: Odsek za zdravje |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Organisational Units of the Department of Health and Social Protection |publisher=City Municipality of Ljubljana |year=2009 |access-date=8 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206073938/http://www.ljubljana.si/si/mol/mestna-uprava/oddelki/zdravje-socialno-varstvo/organizacijske-enote-v-sestavi |archive-date=6 December 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:10 Commandment Rock.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Los Lunas Decalogue Stone ''in situ'' in 1997]]
The '''Los Lunas Decalogue Stone''' is a large boulder on the side of Hidden Mountain, near [[Los Lunas, New Mexico]], about {{convert|35|miles|km}} south of [[Albuquerque]], that bears a very regular inscription carved into a flat panel.&lt;ref&gt;NM State Land Office ''Mystery Stone'' webpage&lt;/ref&gt; The stone is also known as the '''Los Lunas Mystery Stone''' or '''Commandment Rock'''.  The stone is controversial in that some claim the inscription is [[Pre-Columbian]], and therefore proof of [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact|early Semitic contact with the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;This claim is made, e.g., by Fell (1980, p. 167), Gordon (1995), Deal (1999) and Tabor (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first recorded mention of the stone is in 1933, when the late professor [[Frank Hibben]] (1910-2002), an [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] from the [[University of New Mexico]], saw it.&lt;ref&gt;Feder (2011, p. 160) states that the existence of the stone was reported in print in 1933, but gives no reference.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 1996 interview, Hibben was "convinced the inscription is ancient and thus authentic. He report[ed] that he first saw the text in 1933. At the time it was covered with lichen and patination and was hardly visible. He was taken to the site by a guide who had seen it as a boy, back in the 1880s."&lt;ref&gt;Tabor (1997).  Tabor is a Professor in the Department of Religious Studies, University of North Carolina - Charlotte.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Hibben's testimony is tainted by charges 
that in at least two separate incidents, he fabricated some or all of his archaeological data to support his [[Clovis culture|pre-Clovis]] migration theory.&lt;ref&gt;Preston (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bliss (1940).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University buildings named on shaky ground"&gt;Dalton (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

The reported 1880s date of discovery is important to those who believe that the stone is pre-Columbian.  However, the Paleo-Hebrew script, which is closely related to the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician script]], was well known by at least 1870, thus not precluding the possibility of a modern hoax.&lt;ref&gt;Webster (1870, pp. 1766-67) provides a fairly complete, though antiquated, table of the Phoenician, Old Hebrew, and Samaritan alphabets.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Los Lunas Decalogue Stone Vandalized, Aug. 13, 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Los Lunas Decalogue Stone after 2006 vandalization of first line]]

Because of the stone's weight of over 80 tons, it was never moved to a museum or laboratory for study and safekeeping. Many visitors have cleaned the stone inscriptions over the years, likely destroying any possibility for scientific analysis of the inscriptions' [[patina]].  Nevertheless, comparing it to a modern inscription nearby, geologist George E. Morehouse, a colleague of [[Barry Fell]], estimated that the inscription could be between 500 and 2000 years old and explaining its freshness and lack of patina as being due to frequent scrubbing to make it more visible.&lt;ref&gt;Morehouse, George E.; "The Los Lunas Inscriptions, a Geological Study," Epigraphic Society, Occasional Publications, 13:44, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, the first line of the unprotected  inscription was obliterated by vandals.

Visitors to the site are required to purchase a $35 Recreational Access Permit from the New Mexico State Land Office.

==Controversy==

[[File:Samaritan doorpost.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5| Modern [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] mezuzah over doorway.  [[Kiryat Luza]], [[Mount Gerizim]].]]
Archaeolinguist [[Cyrus Gordon]] has proposed that the Los Lunas Decalogue is a [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] [[mezuzah]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;  The familiar Jewish mezuzah is a tiny scroll placed in a small container mounted by the entrance to a house. The ancient Samaritan mezuzah, on the other hand, was commonly a large stone slab placed by the gateway to a property or synagogue, and bearing an abridged version of the Decalogue. On historical and epigraphic grounds, Gordon regards the [[Byzantine]] period as the most likely for the inscription.  The [[Samaritan alphabet]] is a direct descendant of the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet.

One argument against the stone's antiquity is its apparent use of modern Hebrew (or otherwise atypical) punctuation,&lt;ref name="BadArch"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Los Lunas Inscription|url=http://www.badarchaeology.com/out-of-place-artefacts/petroglyphs-inscriptions-and-reliefs/the-los-lunas-inscription/|work=Bad Archaeology|date= 6 September 2011 | author= Keith Fitzpatrick-Matthews|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  though amateur [[epigraphy|epigrapher]] [[Barry Fell]] argued that the punctuation is consistent with antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Fell (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers dismiss the inscription based on the numerous stylistic and grammatical errors that appear in the inscription.&lt;ref name="BadArch" /&gt;

According to archaeologist [[Kenneth Feder]], "the stone is almost certainly a fake."  He points out that "the flat face of the stone shows a very sharp, crisp inscription..." His main concern however is the lack of any archaeological context. He argues that to get to the location of the stone would have required whoever inscribed it to have "stopped along the way, encamped, eaten food, broken things, disposed of trash, performed rituals, and so on. And those actions should have left a trail of physical archaeological evidence across the greater American Southwest, discovery of which would undeniably prove the existence of foreigners in New Mexico in antiquity with a demonstrably ancient Hebrew material culture..." and states that "There are no pre-Columbian ancient Hebrew settlements, no sites containing the everyday detritus of a band of ancient Hebrews, nothing that even a cursory knowledge of how the archaeological record forms would demand there would be. From an archaeological standpoint, that's plainly impossible."&lt;ref&gt;Feder (2011, pp. 159-62).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar landmarks==
The Los Lunas Decalogue Stone is often grouped with the [[Kensington Runestone]], [[Dighton Rock]], and the [[Newport Tower (Rhode Island)|Newport Tower]] as examples of American landmarks with disputed provenances.  Other disputed  American Hebrew inscriptions include the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Bat Creek Inscription]] and the [[Newark Holy Stones|Newark Ohio Decalogue Stone, Keystone, and Johnson-Bradner Stone]].

'''Menachem Friedman''' ({{lang-he|מנחם פרידמן}}; born 1936) is an [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[Emeritus Professor]] of sociology at [[Bar Ilan University]], [[Ramat-Gan]].  He explores the field of religion and the confrontations between religious and secular Judaism in modern history. He also studies the modern process of [[Halachic]] decision making.

Together with [[Samuel Heilman]], Friedman authored "The Rebbe: The Life and Afterlife of Menachem Mendel Schneerson". Many of the authors' conclusions, as well as their methodology and research were later criticized by some scholars including [[Chaim Rapoport]] in a book titled " "The Afterlife of Scholarship - A Critical Review of 'The Rebbe' by Samuel Heilman and Menachem Friedman". Friedman was also criticised for not disclosing that he had served as an expert witness against the rebbe in a lawsuit involving ownership of the [[Chabad]] library, which invites suspicion of an agenda-driven or biased opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Cohen, NY Times, June 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Paleolithic|middle}}
The '''Micoquien''' is an early [[middle paleolithic]] [[Industry (archaeology)|industry]], that is found in the [[Eemian]] and in an early episode of the [[Würm glaciation]] (about 130,000 to 60,000 BCE). The Micoquien is distinguished technologically by the appearance of distinctly asymmetrical [[biface]]s. Its discoverer and namer was the archeologist and art trader [[Otto Hauser]].&lt;ref&gt;Hauser, O. (1906-1907), La Micoque (Dordogne), und ihre Resultate für die Kenntnis der paläolithischen Kultur.- 1. Teil; Basel.. Technologisch bilden die Werkzeuge des Micoquien einen Übergang vom Spät-[[Acheulean|Acheuléen]] zum [[Mousterian|Moustérien]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hauser, O. (1916), La Micoque, die Kultur einer neuen Diluvialrasse. Leipzig.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hauser, O. (1916), Über eine neue Chronologie des mittleren Paläolithikums im Vézèretal. Dissertation Erlangen. Leipzig.&lt;/ref&gt; Hauser then sold a great number of so-called Micoque-wedges that he found in excavations in La Micoque (in [[Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil]], [[Dordogne (département)|Dordogne]], [[France]]) to museums and collectors.

The specially formed handaxes from La Micoque exhibited an often a rounded base. The problem with the term Micoquien is that later excavations have revealed an older time placement for the La Micoque axes, which are now dated in the [[Riss glaciation]].&lt;ref&gt;Rolland, N. (1986), Recent Findings from La Micoque and other Sites in South-Western and Mediterranean France: Their Bearing on the "Tayacian" Problem and Middle Palaeolithic Emergence.- In: Bailey and Callow (Ed.): Stone Age Prehistory. Studies in Memory of Charles McBurney; Cambridge University Press; Cambridge; 121-151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosendahl, G. (1999), La Micoque und das Micoquien in den altsteinzeitlichen Sammlungen des Reiss-Museums Mannheim.- Mannh. Geschichtsblätter N. F. 6; Ubstadt-Weiher; 315-351&lt;/ref&gt;

A wider artifact from the Micoquien is the Keilmesser (bifacially worked knife), which has a clearer chronology in [[Central Europe]]. From this some archeologists have proposed substituting the term Keilmesser group for Micoquien.&lt;ref&gt;Jöris, O.

Der Versuch einer kulturgeographischen Abgrenzung einer mittelpaläolithischen Formengruppe und ihr europäischer Kontext. 84. Ber. Röm.-German. Komm.&lt;/ref&gt;

Micoquien artifacts are distributed across all of [[Eastern Europe]] and Central Europe. In [[Germany]] they can be found at [[Balver Höhle]] and [[Lonetal]].

{{sociology}}
[[File:JHHammond.jpg|thumb|right|[[James Henry Hammond]] coined the "Mudsill Theory"]]

'''Mudsill theory''' is a sociological term indicating the proposition that there must be, and always has been, a [[Underclass|lower class]] for the [[upper classes]] to rest upon. The term derives from a [[mudsill]], the lowest threshold that supports the [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]] for a building.

The theory was first used by South Carolina [[United States Senate|Senator]]/[[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[James Henry Hammond]], a wealthy [[Plantation era|southern plantation]] owner, in a [[United States Senate|Senate]] speech on March 4, 1858,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h3439t.html Africans in America/Part 4/Mudsill Theory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; to justify what he saw as the willingness of the [[lower classes]] and the duty of non-whites to perform menial work which enabled the [[upper classes|higher classes]] to move civilization forward. Efforts to reduce [[Social class|class]] or [[racial inequality]], under this theory, inevitably run counter to civilization itself.

Many saw the argument as a weak justification for [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], and a flimsy example of creating your own [[science]] to reference as [[Logical argument|proof]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Hofstadter|Hofstadter, Richard]]. The American Political Tradition &amp; the Men Who Made It. New York, NY: Knopf, 1974. 86-117.&lt;/ref&gt; An obvious flaw lies in that there are no indications as to which class or race rightfully belongs to the mudsill other than the pre-supposed regional groups that were already in place at the "bottom", thus causing a [[circular argument]].

It was directly used to advocate [[slavery]] in the [[rhetoric]] of others [[Origins of the American Civil War|pre-Civil War]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], that were struggling to maintain their grip on the [[Southern United States|Southern]] economy. They saw the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] as a threat to their powerful new Southern market that revolved almost entirely around the [[Plantation economy|plantation system]] which was furthered by the use of primarily [[Native ethnic groups of Africa|African]] slaves, but also utilized destitute [[Caucasian race|whites]].

These and other colloquialisms were used as rhetoric in what has been dubbed "the [[Marxism]] of the [[Slaveholder|Master-Class]]"&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; which fought for the rights of the propertied elite against what were perceived as threats from the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]], lower classes and non-whites to gain higher standards of living.

[[Abraham Lincoln]] argued forcefully against the mudsill theory, particularly [[s:Address before the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society|in a speech]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], in 1859,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/fair.htm  "Address before the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society," Milwaukee, Wisconsin, September 30, 1859]&lt;/ref&gt; where he delineated its incompatibility with [[Free Soil]]. In his view, mudsill advocates "conclude that all laborers are necessarily either hired laborers, or slaves", since to them, "nobody labors unless somebody else, owning capital... induces him to do it". Further, mudsillers believed that these laborers were "fatally fixed" in their status. Lincoln contrasted his view that labor was in fact the source of capital, noting that a majority of persons in [[Free state (United States)|Free States]] were "neither hirers nor hired", but in such professions as farming where they worked for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Northern soldiers fighting in the [[Western Theater]] of the Civil War turned this derogatory term into one of self pride, as in "Western Mudsill".

The '''Museo Regional de Arqueología de la Democracia''' ("Regional Archaeological Museum of La Democracia") is an archaeological museum in the [[Municipalities of Guatemala|municipality]] of [[La Democracia, Escuintla|La Democracia]] in the [[Departments of Guatemala|department]] of [[Escuintla Department|Escuintla]] in [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="REDCAMUS"&gt;REDCAMUS.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum displays [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n artefacts from the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] lowlands  datingfrom the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era or Formative Period|Preclassic Period]] through to the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Postclassic Era|Postclassic Period]], with a particular emphasis upon the local [[Monte Alto culture]].&lt;ref name="REDCAMUS"/&gt; The museum is open from Tuesday through to Saturday from 8am to 4pm.&lt;ref name="REDCAMUS"/&gt;

==Location==
The museum is situated opposite the central park of La Democracia, which is notable for its display of large prehispanic sculptures in the [[Potbelly sculpture|potbelly]] style.&lt;ref name="REDCAMUS"/&gt; La Democracia is situated in the department of Escuintla at an altitude of {{convert|165|m|ft}} [[above mean sea level]].&lt;ref name="INFORPRESSCA"&gt;INFORPRESSCA.&lt;/ref&gt; It is {{convert|92|km|mi}} from Guatemala City.&lt;ref name="REDCAMUS"/&gt; The local climate is hot, with an average temperature of {{convert|35|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="INFORPRESSCA"/&gt;

==History==
The museum was founded in February 1966 at the instigation of Rubén Chévez van Dorne, who had regularly been given pre-Columbian ceramic pieces by teachers working on a [[cotton plantation]] in the neighbouring municipality of [[La Gomera, Escuintla|La Gomera]], who observed that archaeological remains were frequently uncovered by tractors.&lt;ref name="MCD97p1"&gt;Ministerio de Cultura y Deportes c.1997, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was placed in a school building that was refurbished by [[INGUAT]], the Guatemalan Institute of Tourism; it had previously housed the Escuelas Urbanas de la Democracia.&lt;ref name="MCD97p1"/&gt; The museum opened its doors on 22 May 1972.&lt;ref name="MCD97p1"/&gt; As part of the refurbishment, Guatemalan artist Guillermo Grajeda Meno painted 21 murals within the museum.&lt;ref name="MCD97p1"/&gt;

==Collection==
Aside from its archaeological collection, the museum possesses an exhibition of modern art by Guatemalan artists, displayed on the upper floor.&lt;ref name="REDCAMUS"/&gt; The museum also holds a collection of historical books and documents.&lt;ref name="REDCAMUS"/&gt; The anthropomorphic sculpture of a head outside the museum entrance was loaned for two months for display at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Chévez van Dorne 1978, 1999, pp.19, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Necropolis of Pantalica''' in southeast [[Sicily]], Italy, is a collection of cemeteries with rock-cut chamber tombs dating from the 7th to the 13th centuries BC.  There have been thought to be over 5000 tombs, although the most recent estimate suggests a figure of just under 4000. They extend around the flanks of a large promontory located at the junction of the [[Anapo]] river with its tributary, the [[Calcinara]], about 23 kilometres northwest of Syracuse.  Together with the city of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], Pantalica was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005. 

==Geography==
'''Pantalica''' is located on a limestone promontory surrounded by a deep gorge formed by the [[Anapo]] and [[Calcinara]] rivers between the towns of [[Ferla]] and [[Sortino]] in south-eastern [[Sicily]].  In addition to its archaeological interest it is an important nature reserve (Riserva Naturale Orientata Pantalica), with a variety of local flora and fauna and natural caves (notably the Grotta dei Pipistrelli (Bat Cave)). Various pathways facilitate visitor access, including a disused railway track (dismantled in 1956) along the Anapo valley bottom. The promontory can be accessed directly by car from Ferla, or by walking down the old mule track from the parking place on the road from Sortino and crossing over the Calcinara stream.

==History==

In the 13th century BC, some Sicilian coastal settlements were abandoned, possibly due to the arrival of the [[Sicels]] on the island and the onset of more unsettled conditions. New large sites, like Pantalica, appeared in the hilly coastal hinterlands, probably chosen for defensive reasons.{{Cite needed|date=November 2014}}

Pantalica evidently flourished for about 600 years, from about 1250 to 650 BC. The current name of the site probably dates from the Early Middle Ages or Arab period. The ancient name of the site is uncertain, but is associated by some archaeologists with Hybla, after a Sicel king named Hyblon, who is mentioned by [[Thucydides]] in connection with the foundation of the early Greek colony at [[Megara Hyblaea]] in the year 728 BC. For several centuries before Greek colonization, Pantalica was undoubtedly one of the main sites of eastern Sicily, dominating the surrounding territory, including subsidiary settlements. By about 650 BC, however, it seems to have been a victim of the expansion of the city of Syracuse, which established an outpost at [[Akrai]] (near Palazzolo Acreide) at this time. Nevertheless, it was still occupied during classical antiquity, since finds of the 4th-3rd centuries BC (Hellenistic period) are attested, as well as during the late antique or Byzantine periods. After the 12th century it was probably largely deserted, and overshadowed by Sortino.

The remains visible today consist mainly of numerous prehistoric [[burial chamber]]s cut into the limestone rock, sometimes provided with a porch or short entrance corridor in front of the burial chamber, originally sealed with stones or a slab. There are also some larger rock-cut houses of uncertain date, often said to be Byzantine, but possibly of earlier origin. The so-called ''anaktoron'', or princely palace, located near the top of the hill, is also controversial. Thought by some archaeologists originally to have been a Late Bronze Age building, inspired by palatial buildings of the Greek (Mycenaean) Bronze Age, it was more certainly occupied in the Byzantine period. The remains of a large ditch, cut into the limestone, are clearly visible at Filiporto on the western side of the promontory, nearest to Ferla. This probably dates to the 4th century BC, and represents a defensive work of Greek military design, possibly in line with a policy of Dionysius of Syracuse, designed to secure allied sites in the hinterland. There are also three small medieval rock-cut chapels known respectively as the ''Grotta del Crocifisso'' (near the North cemetery), the ''Grotta di San Nicolicchio'' (on the southern side), and the ''Grotta di San Micidario'' (at Filiporto), which preserve very faint traces of frescoes, and attest the presence of small monastic communities.

The site was mainly excavated between 1895 and 1910 by the Italian archaeologist, [[Paolo Orsi]], although most of the tombs had already been looted long before his time. The finds excavated by Orsi are on display in the Archaeological Museum in Syracuse. They include characteristic red-burnished pottery vessels and metal objects, including weaponry (small knives and daggers) and items of dress, such as bronze [[fibula (brooch)|fibulae (brooches)]] and rings, which were placed with the deceased in the tombs. Most of the tombs contained between one and seven individuals of all ages and both sexes. Many tombs were evidently re-opened periodically for more burials. The average human life span at this time was probably around 30 years of age.{{Cite needed|date=November 2014}} The size of the prehistoric population is hard to estimate from the available data, but might have been 1000 people or more.

==Main monuments==
Pantalica has five cemeteries spread over a large area:
*The '''necropolis of Filiporto''' consists of almost 1000 tombs, located on the southwestern side of the promontory (accessed by road from Ferla). In the same area are the remains of a defensive rock-cut ditch of later date (probably 4th century BC) traversing the promontory at its narrowest point.
*The '''North West necropolis''' is one of the earliest (12th-11th century BC), and is traversed by the tarmac road from Ferla.
*The '''Cavetta necropolis''' has tombs and rock-cut houses of the prehistoric and later periods, and can be seen from the road and designated viewing platforms.
*The '''North necropolis''' is a spectacular cemetery of about 1000 tombs covering very steep slopes overlooking the Calcinara river, best seen from the track coming from Sortino and from viewing platforms near the path. Remains of large rock-cut dwellings are on the gentler slopes to the east.
* The '''South necropolis''' extends along the Anapo river for over 1 kilometre and is easily seen from the trackway at the bottom of the valley (a path leads down to it from the anaktoron). The old railway station, restored, has information about local fauna and flora.

The so-called '''Anaktoron''' (a Mycenaean princely palace) on the top of the hill is a multi-roomed building of large blocks, with various rectangular rooms, excavated in the 19th century by Paolo Orsi. Its origins are obscure (see above) but it was certainly used in the Byzantine period, as attested by roof tiles and pottery. Since no other prehistoric houses have been found on the hilltop, which is rather eroded, the location of the original prehistoric residential quarters remains uncertain. There may have been various clusters of habitation associated with each major burial zone.

'''''Nor of Human:  An Anthology of Fantastic Creatures''''' is the first short story [[anthology]] published by the Canberra Speculative Fiction Guild. Printed in 2001 under {{ISBN|0-646-41393-7}} and edited by Geoffrey Maloney, it contains stories from several Australian speculative fiction authors.

The anthology was one of the first projects the newly founded CSFG embarked on, as a way to provide a focus for members' activities and as a showcase for their work.  The theme of "fantastic creatures" was inspired by a guest speaker at one of the Guild meetings, the Australian [[cryptozoology|cryptozoologist]] known as "Tim the Yowie Man", and two of the anthology stories feature [[yowie (cryptid)|yowies]] (a creature roughly comparable to the American Bigfoot).  The book was launched by SF writer [[Jack Dann]].

The book was shortlisted for four [[Aurealis Award]]s: "The Trojan Rocks", "Tales from the True Desert" and "Happy Birthday To Me" were listed for the science fiction, fantasy and horror categories respectively while Geoffrey Maloney was shortlisted for his work in editing the collection.  Although the shortlist performance was strong the book did not take out the awards themselves.

The collection is "Dedicated to all the creators of speculative fiction, past, present and future; whether or not of human…" All stories in the collection are illustrated by Les Petersen.

==Stories==
The collection contains the following stories:

*''The Trojan Rocks''  by Michael Barry
*''Wyvern's Blood'' by Chris Andrews
*''Cacachatol'' by Peter Barrett
*''Tales From The True Desert'' by Matthew Farrer
*''Playing Possum'' by Maxine McArthur
*''Fringe Dwellers'' by Robbie Matthews
*''Perfect Parasite'' by Carole Nomarhas
*''Sasquatch Winter'' by Les Petersen

In August 2008, five interactive hands-on science exhibits began touring between partner museums, rotating approximately every six months.  Network museums also participate in nationally recognized training programs, exchanging best practices in order to maximize education, fundraising and capacity-building efforts.  Additionally, a 40 ft museum on wheels, the Science Matters Mobile Museum, travels to rural areas of Oklahoma, engaging students in the outer most regions of the state.

==Donald W. Reynolds Foundation==
The Foundation is a national [[philanthropic]] organization founded in 1954 by the late media entrepreneur for whom it is named.  Headquartered in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], Nevada, it is one of the largest private foundations in the United States.

He was prolific in the comic book field and is credited with writing over 4400  stories across a variety of publishers under his own name,&lt;ref name="GCD" /&gt; as well as more than 160 stories under the pen-name [[Eando Binder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb|type=credit|search= Eando+Binder|title= Eando Binder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Born in [[Bessemer, Michigan]], Otto Binder was the youngest of six children in a family that had emigrated from Austria a year earlier. He was born and raised [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]].&lt;ref name="Amazing"/&gt; They settled in Chicago in 1922, during a period rich with science fiction, which enthralled Binder and his brother Earl.&lt;ref name="Amazing"/&gt; The two began writing in partnership and sold their first story, "The First Martian" to ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' in 1930; it saw publication in 1932 under the [[pen name]] "[[Eando Binder]]" ("E" and "O" Binder).&lt;ref name="Amazing"/&gt;

Not earning enough as a writer to live on, Binder and his brother worked at many jobs. Earl found employment at an [[iron works]]. In late December 1935, Otto Binder began working for [[Otis Adelbert Kline]] as a literary agent in charge of Kline's New York City office&lt;ref name=wonder&gt;{{cite book|last=Schelly|first=Bill|authorlink= Bill Schelly|title=Words Of Wonder  The Life And Times of Otto Binder|date=2003|publisher=Hamster Press|location=Seattle, Washington|isbn=0-9645669-9-0|pages=44–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; most prominently marketing the stories of [[Robert E. Howard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://rehtwogunraconteur.com/?p=9957|title= The Kline Connection|first= Rob|last= Roehm|date= May 1, 2011|publisher= REH: Two-Gun Raconteur|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130121143602/http://rehtwogunraconteur.com/?p=9957|archivedate= January 21, 2013|deadurl= yes|df= mdy-all|quote= In 1935, business must have been going well, as Kline enlisted the aid of Otto O. Binder. Binder went to New York late in 1935 to be closer to the publishing scene than Kline’s Chicago offices allowed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although insufficient business during this [[Great Depression]] era forced Kline to close his company after a year and a half.&lt;ref name=wonder/&gt; At the time of Otto's move to New York City, Earl Binder dissolved the writing partnership, and all new material produced under the name of Eando Binder from January 1936 on, was solely the work of Otto Binder.&lt;ref name=wonder/&gt;  Concurrent with his agent work, Binder was writing for [[Mort Weisinger]], editor of ''[[Thrilling Wonder Stories]]'', and [[Raymond A. Palmer|Ray Palmer]], editor of ''Amazing'', for the latter of whom he created the [[Adam Link]] series&lt;ref name="Amazing"/&gt;

===Fawcett Comics and Captain Marvel===
Binder entered comics in 1939 on the heels of his artist brother, [[Jack Binder (comics)|Jack]], who moved to New York to work at the studio of [[Harry "A" Chesler]],&lt;ref name="Amazing"/&gt; one of that era's "packagers" who provided outsourced content for publishers entering the new medium of [[comic books]]. The following year, magazine publisher [[Fawcett Publications]] began its [[Fawcett Comics]] line, and Binder started writing the exploits of such characters as Captain Venture, Golden Arrow, [[Bulletman and Bulletgirl|Bulletman]] and El Carim.&lt;ref name="Amazing"/&gt; After a year, editor [[Ed Herron]] had Binder tackle Fawcett's most prominent character, the superhero [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]. He soon wrote for the spin-off features starring [[Captain Marvel, Jr.]] and [[Mary Marvel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/marymarv.htm |title=Mary Marvel |first=Don |last=Markstein |date=2010 |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Q7IspONL?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/marymarv.htm |archivedate=June 6, 2014 |deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter of whom he co-created with [[Marc Swayze]].&lt;ref name="Amazing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/binder_otto.htm|title= Otto Binder|date= December 25, 2006|publisher= [[Lambiek|Lambiek Comiclopedia]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140421101618/http://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/binder_otto.htm|archivedate= April 21, 2014|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Binder spent from 1941 to 1953 with Fawcett, writing "986 stories ... out of 1,743, over half the entire [[Marvel Family]] saga", per comic-book writer-editor [[E. Nelson Bridwell]].&lt;ref name="Amazing"/&gt; His first Captain Marvel writing was the "Dime Action Book" novel ''Return of the Scorpion'', featuring the villain from the 1941 Republic serial ''The [[Adventures of Captain Marvel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hollywoodchuck Part 1|first= P.C. |last=Hamerlinck| work=[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]] | issue =54| page=87|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=November 2005|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first Captain Marvel comic-book story was "Captain Marvel Saves the King" in ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #9 (April 1942). He wrote for numerous other Fawcett features, as well as many two-page text fillers that were required in comics in order to be eligible for magazine postal rates. His text stories in ''Captain Marvel Adventures'', under the "Eando" pseudonym, starred Lieutenant Jon Jarl of the Space Patrol.&lt;ref name="Amazing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GCD"&gt;{{gcdb|type=credit|search= Otto+Binder|title= Otto Binder}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at Fawcett, Binder co-created with Swayze and [[C. C. Beck]] such characters as Mary Marvel, Uncle Dudley, Mr. [[Tawky Tawny]], [[Black Adam]] and [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mr. Mind]], as well as two of [[Doctor Sivana]]'s four children: the evil teens Thaddeus Sivana Jr. and daughter Georgia.&lt;ref name="Amazing"/&gt; Binder and Beck unsuccessfully attempted to launch a newspaper comic strip featuring Mr. Tawky Tawny in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/otto-binder-c-c-beck-mr-tawny-newspaper-strip-captain-marvel-spinoff-unreleased/ |title=Otto Binder And C.C.

===Other comics work===
Binder left Fawcett when the company shut down its comic book division in 1953, but found no shortage of work. For [[Timely Comics]], the 1940s company that would evolve into [[Marvel Comics]], he [co-]created [[Captain Wonder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1940s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|date = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 24|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= In Captain Wonder's origin story by writer Otto Binder and artist Frank Giacoia, Professor Jordan...was exposed to the fumes of his own experimental 'Wonder Fluid'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Young Allies (Marvel Comics)|Young Allies]], Tommy Tyme and the patriotically themed superheroine [[Miss America (Madeline Joyce)|Miss America]],&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson "1940s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 25: "Miss America's creators, writer Otto Binder and artist Al Gabriele, actually intended their new character to be a female counterpart to Captain America."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/missamer.htm |title=Miss America |first=Don |last=Markstein |date=2010 |publisher=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Q7JBnkHo?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/missamer.htm |archivedate=June 6, 2014 |deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote for stories starring [[Captain America]], the [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]], the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]], the [[Destroyer (Keen Marlow)|Destroyer]], the [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]], and the [[All-Winners Squad]].&lt;ref name="Amazing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GCD" /&gt;

For [[Quality Comics]], Binder co-created [[Kid Eternity]], and wrote [[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawk]], [[Doll Man]], [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]] and [[Black Condor]] stories. For [[MLJ Comics]] (subsequently known as [[Archie Comics]]), he wrote stories starring [[Steel Sterling]], the [[Shield (Archie Comics)|Shield]], the [[Hangman (Archie Comics)|Hangman]], and the [[Black Hood]].&lt;ref name="Amazing"/&gt; At [[Gold Key Comics]], Binder co-created [[Mighty Samson]] and other characters. His science fiction for [[EC Comics]] includes "Lost in Space", illustrated by [[Al Williamson]], in ''[[Weird Science-Fantasy]]'' #28 (March–April 1955).&lt;ref name="GCD" /&gt;

===DC Comics===
In 1948, Binder began working for [[DC Comics]], then known as National Periodical Publications, swiftly creating [[Merry Pemberton|Merry, Girl of 1,000 Gimmicks]], in the feature "[[Sylvester Pemberton|Star-Spangled Kid]]", whose place Merry soon took in ''[[Star-Spangled Comics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace|first= Daniel|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1940s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|date=2010|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 59|quote = Otto Binder wrote the first appearance of Merry, Girl of 1,000 Gimmicks in ''Star-Spangled Comics'' #81 in June [1948].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then moved on to his best-known DC work, the [[Superman]] group of titles, including launching the ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' series in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander C.

DC writer-editor [[E. Nelson Bridwell]] credits Binder as creating the first "[[Elseworlds#Imaginary Stories|Imaginary Tale]], for Lois Lane," and of writing "most of the early" [[Bizarro]] stories,&lt;ref&gt;Bridwell wrote he was "not 100% sure whether he [Binder] wrote the first Bizarro story", but Binder has been credited as Bizarro's co-creator.&lt;/ref&gt; including at least the first "Tales of the Bizarro World" feature.&lt;ref name="Amazing"/&gt; The character's first comic book appearance was in ''[[Superboy (comic book)|Superboy]]'' #68 (Oct. 1958) by Binder and artist [[George Papp]]&lt;ref&gt;Irvine "1950s" in Dolan, p. 91: "A book-length story by writer Otto Binder and artist George Papp took up the entirety of ''Superboy'' #68.  Bizarro was a copy of the Boy of Steel, created by a malfunctioning prototype duplicator ray."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bizarro World]] was introduced in ''Action Comics'' #263 (April 1960).&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie, Michael "1960s" in Dolan, p. 100: "Writer Otto Binder and artist Wayne Boring introduced an entire world filled with the backward beings, living amid foul, dilapidated conditions."&lt;/ref&gt; Binder scripted what Bridwell calls the "classic [storyline] 'Superman's Return to [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]].'"&lt;ref name="Amazing"/&gt; His last Superman story was "The Cage of Doom" in ''Action Comics'' #377 (June 1969).&lt;ref name="GCD" /&gt;

Binder was featured in a story in the first issue of ''[[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)#DC Comics' Shazam! revival|Shazam]]'', DC Comics' 1970s revival of the original Captain Marvel. The Binder character, drawn by [[C. C. Beck]], meets a young Billy Batson and is astonished that the boy, who has been missing for 20 years, is still a kid.&lt;ref name="uslan" /&gt;

===Books===
Binder was a proponent of the [[ancient astronauts]] theory, and a believer in [[extraterrestrial life]]. Binder's theory is that human beings are "homo hybrid" an "interstellar crossbreed" (half human, half extraterrestrial).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Bruce|last= Cathie|title= The Energy Grid|date= 1997|page=  201|publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press|isbn= 0932813445}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first discussed this hypothesis in his 1968 book ''Flying Saucers Are Watching Us'' (later called ''Unsolved Mysteries of the Past'', Tower Publications; reissue edition, 1970).  He wrote ''Mankind Child of the Stars'' with Max Flindt in 1974, discussing the concept of "astroevolution". [[Erich von Däniken]] wrote a foreword for the book, which was revised and reprinted in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Syxpk3eM62UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=otto+binder+max+flindt&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=C3b2TZWTNJPC8QO3n_zBBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0QuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Mankind Child of the Stars| author=  Flindt, Max H.| author2= Binder, Otto O. | publisher = Ozark Mountain Publishing| isbn = 1886940061}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote extensively about [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]s in magazines, including articles detailing the experiences of claimed UFO contactee [[Ted Owens (ufology)|Ted Owens]].

===Final years and death===
Binder became editor of ''Space World'' magazine, a move that ended in [[bankruptcy]] in the early 1960s. As he recalled in 1974:
{{quote|I'm far from retired, simply because I can't afford it. All the money I made from the Marvels and had saved up went down the drain when, in 1960, I invested as junior partner in publishing ''Space World'', a magazine about astronomics... I think it was a good job I did as editor-in-chief—although the public stayed away from it in droves... A loss every month on low sales. The mag lasted some 16 issues, during which time [[William Woolfolk|Bill Woolfolk]] and I had put in more money—I mortgaged my house—all paid up by Cap—and borrowed, etc., but we never got the lucky break. So that left me without money reserves, and it was back to the comics until 1967, when my daughter—our only child—was killed by a car at age 14. For reasons difficult to explain, my wife and I moved from [[Englewood, New Jersey]], to upstate New York where Jack lived. I was pretty broken up and found it difficult to write again up here, but went back to sci-fi, this time as the market hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Lage|first= Matt|title= Otto Binder|work= Legion Outpost|number= 8|date= 1974}} Reprinted in {{cite book|first= Glen |last=Cadigan|title= The Legion Companion|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|date= 2003|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|isbn= 978-1893905221}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Otto Binder's daughter Mary, had been on her way to school one morning when a car jumped the curb, went into the driveway in front of the school and killed her.&lt;ref name=uslan&gt;Recollection of [[Michael Uslan]] in {{cite web|url= http://www.newsarama.com/6759-an-oral-history-of-captain-marvel-the-lost-years-pt-3.html|last=Smith|first= Zack|title=An Oral History of Captain Marvel: The Lost Years, Part 3|date= December 30, 2010|publisher= [[Newsarama]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131219044853/http://www.newsarama.com/6759-an-oral-history-of-captain-marvel-the-lost-years-pt-3.html|archivedate= December 19, 2013|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=steranko-21&gt;{{cite book|title=The Steranko History of Comics 2|first=Jim|last=Steranko|page=21|publisher=Supergraphics|date=1972|authorlink=Jim Steranko|location=[[Reading, Pennsylvania]]|isbn= 0-517-50188-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; As film producer and comics historian [[Michael Uslan]], a family friend, recalled, "Otto never recovered. His wife never recovered. She had a breakdown, and Otto started drinking, and eventually he dropped dead of a [[heart attack]]. And the three of them were gone, like in a flash."&lt;ref name=uslan /&gt; Binder recalled in a 1972 history of comics, that after his daughter's death
{{quote|...we finally made up our minds to 'start a new life.' When we moved to upstate New York in 1969, I quit DC and comics entirely and went back into the sci-fi paperback field. [[Curtis Books]] bought seven of my books in a row, including a few oldies, and Belmont issued another half a dozen. I began selling 'gothics' besides a batch of [[flying saucer]] books and articles for ''[[Saga (magazine)|Saga]]'' magazine."&lt;ref name=steranko-21 /&gt;}}

In 1973, Binder worked for [[Vincent Fago]]'s [[Pendulum Press]], adapting classic science-fiction stories into comic book format, including ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ''[[The Invisible Man]]'', ''[[The Time Machine]]'', ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' and ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''.&lt;ref name="Amazing"/&gt;

He died in [[Chestertown, New York]] on October 13, 1974, leaving behind, counted Bridwell, "almost 50,000 pages of comics" comprising "over 1,300 scripts for Fawcett" and "more than 2,000 for 20 other publishers", including "some 93 heroes in 198 magazines."&lt;ref name="Amazing"&gt;{{Cite journal|authorlink=E.

==Awards and legacy==
Binder was posthumously inducted into the [[List of Eisner Award winners#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Will Eisner Hall of Fame]] in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.comic-con.org/awards/hall-fame-awards|title= Will Eisner Hall of Fame|publisher= [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140329174828/http://comic-con.org/awards/hall-fame-awards|archivedate= March 29, 2014|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all|accessdate= May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and given the [[Bill Finger Award]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=26635|title= Otto Binder, Gary Friedrich to Receive Bill Finger Award|date= June 10, 2010|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140606022107/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=26635|archivedate=June 6, 2014 |deadurl= no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], a '''phonemic orthography''' is an [[orthography]] (system for writing a [[language]]) in which the [[grapheme]]s (written symbols) correspond to the [[phoneme]]s (significant spoken sounds) of the language. Languages rarely have perfectly phonemic orthographies; a high degree of grapheme-phoneme correspondence can be expected in orthographies based on [[alphabet]]ic writing systems, but they differ in how complete this correspondence is. [[English orthography]], for example, is alphabetic but highly nonphonemic; it was once mostly phonemic during the Middle English stage, when the modern spellings originated, but [[Great Vowel Shift|spoken English changed rapidly]] while the orthography was much more stable, resulting in the modern nonphonemic situation. However, because of their relatively recent modernizations when compared to English, the [[Italian orthography|Italian]], [[Turkish orthography|Turkish]], [[Spanish orthography|Spanish]], [[Finnish orthography|Finnish]], [[Czech orthography|Czech]], [[Latvian orthography|Latvian]] and [[Polish orthography|Polish]] orthographic systems come much closer to being consistent phonemic representations.

In less formal terms, a language with a highly phonemic orthography may be described as having '''regular spelling'''. Another terminology is that of [[orthographic depth|deep and shallow orthographies]] in which the depth of an orthography is the degree to which it diverges from being truly phonemic. The concept can also be applied to nonalphabetic writing systems like [[syllabary|syllabaries]].

=={{anchor|Unigraph|Monograph}}Ideal phonemic orthography==
In an ideal phonemic orthography, there would be a complete one-to-one correspondence ([[bijection]]) between the graphemes (letters) and the phonemes of the language, and each phoneme would invariably be represented by its corresponding grapheme. So the spelling of a word would unambiguously and transparently indicate its pronunciation, and conversely, a speaker knowing the pronunciation of a word would be able to infer its spelling without any doubt. That ideal situation is rare but exists in a few languages.

A disputed example of an ideally phonemic orthography is the [[Serbo-Croatian]] language. In its alphabet ([[Latin alphabet|Latin]] as well as [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]]), there are 30 graphemes, each uniquely corresponding to one of the phonemes. This seemingly perfect yet simple phonemic orthography was achieved in the 19th century—the Cyrillic alphabet first in 1814 by Serbian linguist [[Vuk Karadžić]], and the Latin alphabet in 1830 by Croatian linguist [[Ljudevit Gaj]]. Another such ideal phonemic orthography is native to [[Esperanto]], employing the language creator L. L. Zamenhof's then-pronounced principle “one letter, one sound”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bertilow.com/pmeg/skribo_elparolo/elparolo/bazaj_reguloj.html "Bazaj elparolaj reguloj — PMEG"]. bertilow.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a nearly-ideal phonemic orthography is the [[Ukrainian language]]. Its alphabet comprises thirty-three letters, representing thirty-eight [[phoneme]]s and an additional sign: the apostrophe. Twenty letters represent [[consonant]]s, ten [[vowel]]s, and two [[semivowel]]s. The [[soft sign]] {{lang|uk|ь}} has no meaning when written by itself, but when written after a consonant, it indicates that the consonant is soft ([[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]]). The [[apostrophe]] negates palatalization in places that it would be applied by normal orthographic rules. It also appears after labial consonants in some words, such as {{wikt-lang|uk|ім'я́}} "name".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukrainianlanguage.org.uk/read/unit20/page20-3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; And it is retained in transliterations from the Latin alphabet: {{lang|uk|Кот-д’Івуар}} ([[Côte d'Ivoire]]) and {{lang|uk|О’Тул}} ([[O'Toole (surname)|O'Toole]]).

There are two distinct types of deviation from this phonemic ideal. In the first case, the exact one-to-one correspondence may be lost (for example, some phoneme may be represented by a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] instead of a single letter), but the "regularity" is retained: there is still an [[algorithm]] (but a more complex one) for predicting the spelling from the pronunciation and vice versa. In the second case, true irregularity is introduced, as certain words come to be spelled and pronounced according to different rules from others, and prediction of spelling from pronunciation and vice versa is no longer possible. Common cases of both of types of deviation from the ideal are discussed in the following section.

==Deviations from phonemic orthography==
Some ways in which orthographies may deviate from the ideal of one-to-one grapheme-phoneme correspondence are listed below. The first list contains deviations that tend only to make the relation between spelling and pronunciation more complex, without affecting its predictability (see above paragraph).

===Case 1: Regular===
'''''Pronunciation and spelling still correspond in a predictable way'''''
*A phoneme may be represented by a sequence of letters, called a [[multigraph (orthography)|multigraph]], rather than by a single letter (as in the case of the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''ch'' in English and French and the [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]] ''sch'' in German). That only retains predictability if the multigraph cannot be broken down into smaller units. Some languages use diacritics to distinguish between a digraph and a sequence of individual letters, and others require knowledge of the language to distinguish them; compare ''[[goatherd]]'' in English.

Examples:

''sch'' versus ''s-ch'' in [[Romansh language|Romansch]]

''ng'' versus ''n'' + ''g'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]

''ch'' versus ''çh'' in [[Manx Gaelic]]: this is a slightly different case where the same digraph is used for two different single phonemes.

''ai'' versus ''aï'' in [[French language|French]]

This is often due to the use of an alphabet that was originally used for a different language (the [[Latin alphabet]] in these examples) and so does not have single letters available for all the phonemes used in the current language (although some orthographies use devices such as [[diacritic]]s to increase the number of available letters).
*Sometimes, conversely, a single letter may represent a sequence of more than one phoneme (as ''[[x]]'' can represent the sequence /ks/ in English and other languages).
*Sometimes, the rules of correspondence are more complex and depend on adjacent letters, often as a result of historical [[sound change]]s (as with the rules for the pronunciation of ''ca'' and ''ci'' in [[Italian orthography|Italian]] and the [[silent e|silent ''e'']] in English).

===Case 2: Irregular===
'''''Pronunciation and spelling do not always correspond in a predictable way'''''
* Sometimes, different letters correspond to the same phoneme (for instance ''u'' and ''ó'' in [[Polish orthography|Polish]] are both pronounced as the phoneme /u/). That is often for historical reasons (the Polish letters originally stood for different phonemes, which later [[merger (phonology)|merged]] phonologically). That affects the predictability of spelling from pronunciation but not necessarily vice versa. Another example is found in [[Modern Greek]], whose phoneme /i/ can be written in six different ways: ι, η, υ, ει, οι and υι.
* Conversely, a letter or group of letters can correspond to different phonemes in different contexts. For example, ''[[th (digraph)|th]]'' in English can be pronounced as ð (as in ''this'') or θ (as in ''thin'').
*Spelling may otherwise represent a historical pronunciation; orthography does not necessarily keep up with [[sound change]]s in the spoken language. For example, both the ''k'' and the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''gh'' of English ''knight'' were once pronounced, but after the [[Phonological change#Loss|loss]] of their sounds, they no longer represent the word's phonemic structure or its pronunciation.
*Spelling may represent the pronunciation of a different [[dialect]] from the one being considered. Orthographies tend to reflect a [[standard language|standard variety]] of the language; however, for an international language with wide variations in its dialects, such as [[English language|English]], it would be impossible to represent even the major varieties of the language with a single phonemic orthography.
*Spellings of [[loanword]]s often adhere to or are influenced by the orthography of the source language (as with the English words ''ballet'' and ''fajita'', from French and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] respectively). With some loanwords, though, regularity is retained either by 
** nativizing the pronunciation to match the spelling (as with the [[Russian language|Russian]] word шофёр, from French ''chauffeur'' but pronounced {{IPA|[ʂɐˈfʲor]}} in accordance with the normal rules of [[vowel reduction in Russian|Russian vowel reduction]]; see also [[spelling pronunciation]]) or by 
** [[Pronunciation spelling|nativizing the spelling]] (for example, ''football'' is spelt ''fútbol'' in Spanish and ''futebol'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]).
*Spelling may reflect a [[false etymology]] (as in the English words ''hiccough'', ''island'', so spelt because of an imagined connection with the words ''cough'' and ''isle''), or distant etymology (as in the English word ''debt'' in which the silent ''b'' was added under the influence of Latin).
* Spelling may reflect [[morphophonemic]] structure rather than the purely phonemic (see next section) although it is often also a reflection of historical pronunciation.

Most orthographies do not reflect the changes in pronunciation known as [[sandhi]] in which pronunciation is affected by adjacent sounds in neighboring words (written [[Sanskrit]] and other [[Languages of India|Indian languages]], however, reflect such changes). A language may also use different sets of symbols or different rules for distinct sets of vocabulary items such as the Japanese [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] syllabaries (and the different treatment in English orthography of words derived from Latin and Greek).

== Morphophonemic features ==
Alphabetic orthographies often have features that are [[morphophonemic]] rather than purely phonemic. This means that the spelling reflects to some extent the underlying [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] structure of the words, not only their pronunciation. Hence different forms of a [[morpheme]] (minimum meaningful unit of language) are often spelt identically or similarly in spite of differences in their pronunciation. That is often for historical reasons; the morphophonemic spelling reflects a previous pronunciation from before historical [[sound change]]s that caused the variation in pronunciation of a given morpheme. Such spellings can assist in the recognition of words when reading.

Some examples of morphophonemic features in orthography are described below.
*The English plural morpheme is written ''-s'' regardless of whether it is pronounced as {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/z/}}; it is ''cat'''s''''' and ''dog'''s''''', not ''dog'''z'''''. This is because the {{IPA|[s]}} and {{IPA|[z]}} sounds are forms of the same underlying [[morphophoneme]], automatically pronounced differently depending on its environment. (However when this morpheme takes the form {{IPA|/ɪz/}}, the addition of the vowel ''is'' reflected in the spelling: ''church'''es''''', ''mass'''es'''''.)
*Similarly the English past tense morpheme is written ''-ed'' regardless of whether it is pronounced as {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/ɪd/}}.
*Many English words retain spellings that reflect their [[etymology]] and morphology rather than their present-day pronunciation. For example, ''sign'' and ''signature'' include the spelling &lt;sign&gt;, which means the same but is pronounced differently in the two words. Other examples are "'''''sci'''ence'' {{IPA|/saɪ/}} vs. ''con'''sci'''ence'' {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, '''''pre'''judice'' {{IPA|/prɛ/}} vs. '''''pre'''quel'' {{IPA|/priː/}}, '''''na'''tion'' {{IPA|/neɪ/}} vs. '''''na'''tionalism'' {{IPA|/næ/}}, and '''''spe'''cial'' {{IPA|/spɛ/}} vs. '''''spe'''cies'' {{IPA|/spiː/}}.
*Phonological [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] is often not reflected in spelling even in otherwise phonemic orthographies such as Spanish, in which ''obtener'' "obtain" and ''optimista'' "optimist" are written with ''b'' and ''p'' respectively even though both are pronounced {{IPA|/p/}} by assimilation with the following {{IPA|/t/}}.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} On the other hand, Serbo-Croatian (Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian and Montenegrin) spelling reflects assimilation so one writes ''Ср'''б'''ија/Sr'''b'''ija'' "Serbia" but ''ср'''п'''ски/sr'''p'''ski'' "Serbian".
*The [[final-obstruent devoicing]] that occurs in many languages (such as German, Polish, Russian and Welsh) is not normally reflected in the spelling. For example, in German, ''Bad'' "bath" is spelt with a final ''d'' even though it is pronounced {{IPA|/t/}}, thus corresponding to other morphologically related forms such as the verb ''baden'' (bathe) in which the ''d'' is pronounced {{IPA|/d/}}. (Compare ''Rat'', ''raten'' ("advice", "advise") in which the ''t'' is pronounced {{IPA|/t/}} in both positions.) [[Turkish language|Turkish]] orthography, however, is more strictly phonemic: for example, the imperative of ''eder'' "does" is spelled ''et'', as it is pronounced (and the same as the word for "meat"), not ''*ed'', as it would be if German spelling were used.

Korean ''[[hangul]]'' has changed over the centuries from a highly phonemic to a largely morphophonemic orthography.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Japanese kana are almost completely phonemic but have a few morphophonemic aspects, notably in the use of ぢ ''di'' and づ ''du'' (rather than じ ''ji'' and ず ''zu'', their pronunciation in standard Tokyo dialect), when the character is a voicing of an underlying ち or つ. That is from the [[rendaku]] sound change combined with the [[yotsugana]] merger of formally different morae. The [[Russian orthography]] is also mostly morphophonemic, because it does not reflect vowel reduction, consonant assimilation and final-obstruent devoicing. Also, some consonant combinations have silent consonants.

==Defective orthographies==
A [[defective orthography]] is one that is not capable of representing all the phonemes or phonemic distinctions in a language. An example of such a deficiency in English orthography is the lack of distinction between the voiced and voiceless "th" phonemes, occurring in words like ''this'' and ''thin'' respectively (both have to be written ''th'').

== Comparison between languages ==
Languages with a high grapheme-to-phoneme and phoneme-to-grapheme correspondence (excluding exceptions due to loan words and assimilation) include [[Maltese alphabet|Maltese]], [[Finnish alphabet|Finnish]], [[Albanian alphabet|Albanian]], [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian]], [[Turkish alphabet|Turkish]] (apart from ''ğ'' and various palatal and vowel allophones), [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] ([[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]), [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian alphabet|Macedonian]] (if the apostrophe denoting [[schwa]] is counted, though slight inconsistencies may be found), [[Armenian alphabet|Eastern Armenian]] (apart from ''o'', ''v''), [[Basque alphabet|Basque]] (apart from palatalized ''l'', ''n''), [[Haitian Creole]], [[Spanish alphabet|Castilian Spanish]] (apart from ''h'', ''x'', ''b''/''v'', and sometimes ''k'', ''c'', ''g'', ''j'', ''z''), [[Czech alphabet|Czech]] (apart from ''ě'', ''ů'', ''y'', ''ý''), [[Polish alphabet|Polish]] (apart from ''ó'', ''h'', ''rz''), [[Romanian alphabet|Romanian]] (apart from distinguishing semivowels from vowels), [[Ukrainian alphabet|Ukrainian]] (mainly phonemic with some other historical/morphological rules, as well as palatalization), [[Belarusian alphabet|Belarusian]] (phonemic for vowels but morphophonemic for consonants except ''ў'' written phonetically), [[Swahili language|Swahili]] (missing aspirated consonants, which do not occur in all varieties and anyway are sparsely used), [[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet|Mongolian]] (apart from letters representing multiple sounds depending on front or back vowels, the soft and hard sign, silent letters to indicate {{IPA|/ŋ/}} from {{IPA|/n/}} and voiced versus voiceless consonants) [[Azerbaijani alphabet|Azerbaijani]] (apart from ''k''), and [[Kazakh alphabet|Kazakh]] (apart from ''и'', ''у'', ''х'', ''щ'', ''ю'').

Languages with highly phonemic orthographies often lack or rarely use a word corresponding to the English verb "to spell" because the act of spelling out words is rarely needed (careful pronunciation of a word is generally sufficient to convey its spelling). That is the case in [[Italian language|Italian]]: spelling is queried by asking "''Come si scrive?''" 'How do you write?', and the question is answered by pronouncing the word syllabically (e.g. {{IPA|[tʃok.ko.ˈlaː.to]}}, ''cioccolato,'' "chocolate" would be spelled ''cioc-co-la-to''). It should be noted, however, that Italian is far from perfectly phonemic, with many phonemes which are impossible to determine from orthography: for instance, 'sci' represents IPA [ʃ] in most words, but IPA [ʃi] in others. Also  ''e'', ''o'', ''s'', ''z'' can be pronounced in different ways, changing in some words (like ''[[Monza]]'' or ''[[Day|giorno]]'') from a part of the country to another, making it possible to recognise someone's origin.

Many otherwise phonemic orthographies are slightly [[defective script|defective]]: [[Malay alphabet|Malay]], [[Italian alphabet|Italian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], and [[Welsh orthography|Welsh]] do not fully distinguish their vowels, [[Serbo-Croatian#Writing systems|Serbo-Croatian]] does not distinguish [[pitch accent|tone and vowel length]], [[Somali alphabet|Somali]] does not distinguish vowel [[phonation]], and graphemes ''b'' and ''v'' represent the same phoneme in all varieties of Spanish, while in Spanish of the Americas, {{IPA|/s/}} can be represented by graphemes ''s'', ''c'', or ''z''. Modern Indo-Aryan languages like [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]] and several others feature [[Schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages|schwa deletion]], where the implicit default vowel is suppressed without being explicitly marked as such. Others, like [[Marathi language|Marathi]], do not have a high grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence for vowel lengths. 

[[French language|French]], with its [[silent letter]]s and its heavy use of [[nasal vowel]]s and [[elision]], may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation, but its rules on pronunciation, though complex, are consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy. The actual letter-to-phoneme correspondence, however, is often low and a sequence of sounds may have multiple ways of being spelt.

Orthographies such as those of [[German orthography|German]], [[Hungarian orthography|Hungarian]] (mainly phonemic with the exception ''ly'', ''j'' representing the same sound, but consonant and vowel length are not always accurate and various spellings reflect etymology, not pronunciation), [[Portuguese orthography|Portuguese]], and modern [[Greek orthography|Greek]] (written with the [[Greek alphabet]]), as well as Korean [[hangul]], are sometimes considered to be of intermediate depth (for example they include many morphophonemic features, as described above).

[[English orthography]] is highly non-phonemic. As with many languages spoken over a wide area, it would in any case be hard to construct an orthography that reflected all of the main dialects of English, because of differences in [[phonology|phonological]] systems (such as between standard [[Received Pronunciation|British]] and [[American English]], and between these and [[Australian English]] with its [[Phonological history of English short A#Bad–lad split|bad–lad split]], or even between adjacent counties of Britain). The irregularity of English spelling arises partly because the [[Great Vowel Shift]] occurred after the orthography was established; partly because English has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times, retaining their original spelling at varying levels; and partly because the regularisation of the spelling (moving away from the situation in which many different spellings were acceptable for the same word) happened arbitrarily over a period without any central plan. However even English has general, albeit complex, rules that predict pronunciation from spelling, and several of these rules are successful most of the time; rules to predict spelling from the pronunciation have a higher failure rate.

Most [[constructed language]]s such as [[Esperanto]] and [[Lojban]] have mostly phonemic orthographies.

The [[syllabary]] systems of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ([[hiragana]] and [[katakana]]) are examples of almost perfectly shallow orthography – exceptions include the use of ぢ and づ (discussed above) and the use of は, を, and へ to represent the sounds わ, お, and え, as relics of [[historical kana usage]].

==Realignment of orthography==
With time, [[phonological change|pronunciations change]] and spellings become out of date, as has happened to English and [[French language|French]]. In order to maintain a phonemic orthography such a system would need periodic updating, as has been attempted by various [[List of language regulators|language regulators]] and proposed by other [[spelling reform]]ers.

Sometimes the pronunciation of a word changes to match its spelling; this is called a [[spelling pronunciation]]. This is most common with loanwords, but occasionally occurs in the case of established native words too.

In some English personal names and place names, the relationship between the spelling of the name and its pronunciation is so distant that associations between phonemes and graphemes cannot be readily identified. Moreover, in many other words, the pronunciation has subsequently evolved from a fixed spelling, so that it has to be said that the phonemes represent the graphemes rather than vice versa. And in much technical jargon, the primary medium of communication is the written language rather than the spoken language, so the phonemes represent the graphemes, and it is unimportant how the word is pronounced. Moreover, the sounds which literate people perceive being heard in a word are significantly influenced by the actual spelling of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=David Stark|title=Standardised Spelling - Pronunciation 1.|url=http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j3/pronunciation.php|publisher=The English Spelling Society|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307024851/http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j3/pronunciation.php|archivedate=7 March 2014|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, countries have the written language undergo a [[spelling reform]] to realign the writing with the contemporary spoken language. These can range from simple spelling changes and word forms to switching the entire writing system itself, as when [[Turkey]] switched from the Arabic alphabet to a [[Turkish alphabet]] of Latin origin.

== Phonetic transcription ==
Methods for [[phonetic transcription]] such as the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) aim to describe pronunciation in a standard form. They are often used to solve ambiguities in the spelling of written language. They may also be used to write languages with no previous written form.  Systems like IPA can be used for phonemic representation or for showing more detailed phonetic information (see [[Phonetic transcription#Narrow versus broad transcription|Narrow vs. broad transcription]]).

Phonemic orthographies are different from phonetic transcription; whereas in a phonemic orthography, [[allophone]]s will usually be represented by the same grapheme, a purely phonetic script would demand that phonetically distinct allophones be distinguished.  To take an example from American English: the {{IPA|/t/}} sound in the words "table" and "cat" would, in a phonemic orthography, be written with the same character; however, a strictly phonetic script would make a distinction between the [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] "t" in "table", the [[alveolar flap|flap]] in "butter", the [[unaspirated]] "t" in "stop" and the [[glottalization|glottalized]] "t" in "cat" (not all these allophones exist in all English [[dialect]]s). In other words, the sound that most English speakers think of as {{IPA|/t/}} is really a group of sounds, all pronounced slightly differently depending on where they occur in a word.  A perfect phonemic orthography has one letter per group of sounds (phoneme), with different letters only where the sounds distinguish words (so "bed" is spelled differently from "bet").

A narrow phonetic transcription represents [[Phone (phonetics)|phones]], the atomic sounds humans are capable of producing, many of which will often be grouped together as a single phoneme in any given natural language, though the groupings vary across languages.  English, for example, does not distinguish between aspirated and unaspirated consonants, but other languages, like [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Hindi language|Hindi]], do. On the other hand, [[Korean language|Korean]] does not distinguish between voiced and voiceless consonants unlike a number of other languages.

The sounds of speech of all languages of the world can be written by a rather small universal phonetic alphabet. A standard for this is the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].

'''Post Bellum''' is an educational [[nonprofit organization]] based in [[Prague]], Czech Republic, founded in 2001. The organization was formed by a group of historians and journalists with the aim of increasing public knowledge of the 20th Century history of the Czech Republic and neighboring countries, especially among younger generations.&lt;ref name="brochure"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.postbellum.cz/wp-content/uploads/pb_promo_EN_web.pdf|title=English Brochure: Post Bellum|last=|first=|date=|website=Post Bellum|access-date=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Post Bellum has collected thousands of witness accounts by conducting interviews with people who lived through significant periods in history as part of their documentation project, ''Stories of the 20th Century'', and for their online archive, Memory of Nations. They organize various other projects and activities to raise awareness of modern history. The stated aim of the organisation is to "understand the past through authentic testimony".&lt;ref name="brochure" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Post Bellum is an associate member organization of the [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]].

== Memory of Nations ==
The organisation has created an archive of oral historical testimony entitled ''Memory of Nations'', in partnership with the [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] and [[Czech Radio]].&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|4}} The archive is the largest online collection of testimonies in Central Europe, documenting the stories of "war veterans, Holocaust survivors, political prisoners, as well as members of the Communist Party, the Secret Police, and the People’s Militias".&lt;ref name="brochure" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Witnesses are interviewed in their original language, then translated into English. The interviews are then archived online, where they can be browsed using different categories, dates, places, and so on, in order to locate anecdotes and interviews regarding specific events. Initially, Czech Radio provided the technical support to carry out the interviews and witness recordings, and the organisation later{{when|date=July 2018}} began using [[Eye Direct]] technology to record the testimonies. As of July 2018, there are 8281 witnesses in the database and 4499 published witnesses, as well as over 60,000 images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.memoryofnations.eu|title=Memory of Nations|website=www.memoryofnations.eu|language=en|access-date=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable people who have provided testimony for the database include [[Zdeňka Deitchová]], [[Augustin Bubník]], [[Václav Havel]], [[Helga Hošková-Weissová]], [[Milan Knížák]], [[František Zahrádka]], [[Felix Kolmer]], and [[Rudolf Bereza]].

Post Bellum also developed an app, Memory of Nations Sites, with an interactive map allowing users to access archive materials from the 20th century related to their current location. The app is available in English and Czech, and won the [[Vodafone#Vodafone_Foundation|Vodafone Foundation]] Prize in 2012 for the "Best Application Idea."&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|16}}

=== The Memory of Nations Awards ===
[[File:Ceny paměti národa 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Memory of Nations Award ceremony in 2011.]]The Memory of Nations Award is awarded to five recipients each year, since 2010, in recognition of bravery in standing up to totalitarian regimes.&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|15}} Recipients are chosen from among 20 nominees by a panel of judges from the fields of historical research, journalism, and politics. The ceremony takes place each year on 17 November, the anniversary of the beginning of the [[Velvet Revolution]], and is broadcast live on television. Each year, the award ceremony has a different theme. In November 2014, the award was presented to people involved in resistance to the [[Iron Curtain]] in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland and Germany, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism in Europe]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

=== The Run for Memory of Nations ===
The Run for Memory of Nations is an annual long-distance run organised to remember and honour [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] victims, political prisoners, veterans, and dissidents.

==''Stories from the 20th Century''==
''Stories from the 20th Century'' is a radio show telling witnesses' stories from Post Bellum's ''Memory of Nations'' archive, that has aired every Sunday since 2006 on [[Czech Radio]].&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|14}} The people interviewed include war veterans, [[Holocaust survivors]], political prisoners of Nazi and Communist times, and members of minority groups. 

''Stories from the 20th Century'' was also the name of a documentary series that aired on [[Česká televize|Czech Television]], focused on life during [[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|Normalization]]. The series featured interviews with [[StB]] agents, miners, members of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist party]], [[LGBT|gay people]], and black market currency dealers.&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|14}}

== Educational initiatives ==
[[File:My jsme to nevzdali 2009 7268.JPG|thumb|right|Open Air Exposition opening organised in 2009 by Post Bellum in [[Prague]].]]
Post Bellum is involved with a number of initiatives aimed at increasing public knowledge of [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]], especially among young people. They use witness testimonies as part of workshops in schools in which students are encouraged to think critically about historical events,&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|8}} as well as "Experience Workshops", which involve immersion in historical events and students participating in role plays of events from the mid-1900s and the [[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|Normalization]] period.&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|11}} 

Another educational initiative is "Our Neighbors’ Stories",&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|9}} a program in which students record witness testimonies locally, which are then retold through radio or TV. Students also carry out research into the witnesses' situations which is presented together with the testimony.

Post Bellum has also published a number of educational books such as ''We Are Still At War'' and ''Forced Labour'', graphic novels based on true stories of people affected by totalitarian regimes.

== Other activities ==
[[File:Koncentracni tabor Mauthausen Praha 2012 7934.JPG|thumb|right|Replica of Mauthausen Concentration camp in Charles Square, Prague, 2012.]]
Post Bellum has also documented witnesses in other parts of the world, such as the United States, Poland, and Israel.&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|6}} They have partnerships with the [[Visegrad Fund]] and the German [[Foundation Remembrance, Responsibility and Future]] (EVZ) to record witness testimonies, and have also{{when|date=July 2018}} begun a partnership with [[Florida International University]] to document the testimonies of Cuban dissidents.&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|6}} 

Post Bellum has put on about 128 exhibitions all around Europe.&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|17}} In May-July 2012, they built a replica of [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp complex|Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]] in [[Charles Square]] in Prague as part of an exhibition to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the [[Operation Anthropoid|assassination of Reinhard Heydrich]].

'''''Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks''''' is a 2001 play by American playwright [[Richard Alfieri]].&lt;ref name = PremiereReview /&gt;  It is a [[two-hander|play with only two characters]]: Lily Harrison, the formidable widow of a Baptist minister, and Michael Minetti, a gay and acerbic dance instructor hired to give her dancing lessons.&lt;ref name = 6DLsite&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.sixdancelessonsinsixweeks.com/|title = The International Hit Play 'Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks' by Richard Alfieri &amp;ndash; The Play|accessdate = 29 September 2016|website = sixdancelessonsinsixweeks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It premiered at the [[Geffen Playhouse]] in Los Angeles (with [[Uta Hagen]] and [[David Hyde Pierce]] in its two roles)&lt;ref name = PremiereReview /&gt; before moving to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].&lt;ref name = BroadwayClose /&gt;  It has gone on to performances in 24 countries and been translated into 14 languages.&lt;ref name = 6DLsite /&gt;

==Synopsis==
Lily Harrison is a self-described "tight-arsed old biddy"&lt;ref name = WestEnd /&gt; living alone in [[St Petersburg Beach]] on the [[gulf coast]] of [[Florida]].  As the play opens, she is waiting for her first of six weekly in-home dance lessons.&lt;ref name = 6DLsite /&gt;  Her tutor is Michael Minetti, an acerbic gay man who has been forced by circumstances to leave his life as a chorus boy on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and to take work as a dance instructor.&lt;ref name = LondonTheatre /&gt;  Lily is Michael's first client, and their first lesson does not go well owing to his foul language and the fact that both are bitter.  Each lies to the other, Lily claiming her husband is soon coming home (in fact, she is a widow whose life was cramped by her [[Southern Baptist]] [[Minister (Christianity)|Minister]] husband), and Michael claiming to be married to hide both his homosexuality and the pain of his lover's death.&lt;ref name = WestEnd /&gt;&lt;ref name = LondonTheatre&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.londontheatre.co.uk/reviews/six-dance-lessons-in-six-weeks|title = Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks|date = 30 November 2006|first = Peter|last = Brown|accessdate = 29 September 2016|website = londontheatre.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the lessons continue, an improbable friendship develops out of their shared testiness and solitude.&lt;ref name = WestEnd /&gt;  It becomes clear that Lily did not need lessons but rather a dance partner, and the pair enjoy time together outside of their lessons.  The friendship grows to the point where Lily is playing match-maker for Michael, and Michael is caring for Lily as her health deteriorates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks|chapter = Week Ten &amp;ndash; Bonus Lesson|pages = 81–83|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LBGG_1D9UcgC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=lily+matchmaker+michael+six+dance+lessons&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Zd5GMN8SSw&amp;sig=5hkXuWJCFAUKJgrKUlyRi0BLumA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUzYzrm6DQAhVPzWMKHWEKCLEQ6AEIMzAE|first = Richard|last = Alfieri|authorlink = Richard Alfieri|publisher = [[Samuel French, Inc.]]|year = 2005|isbn = 9780573602795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''talking shop''' or '''debating society''' is an organisation or place where discussion is the main activity, with no decisions or actions necessarily arising from the discussion.  Talking shops may be considered unproductive, [[bureaucratic]] or self-serving and so may lack respect and power. The term "debating society" is considered derisive.

The term 'Talking shop' is usually used in a pejorative or derogatory sense; apparently fruitless discussion forums are often dismissed as talking shops.

The term has been applied to many political forums, including [[supranational]] bodies such as the [[League of Nations]], the [[United Nations]], the [[European Parliament]], [[European Political Cooperation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd5d1CwtI7cC&amp;pg=PA200 |title=Community and communication |author=Sue Wright |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[ASEAN]], the [[Organisation of African Unity]] or [[devolved]] and [[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] bodies such as the [[National Assembly for Wales]] or the [[regions of England]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6333">The '''tiao-kuai''' ({{zh|c=条块|p=tiáo-kuài|l=branch and lump}}) system, also known as '''tiáotiáo-kuàikuài''' ({{lang|zh-hans|条条块块}}) to emphasize the plurality, describes the quasi-[[Federation|federal]] arrangement of administration in the [[People's Republic of China]]. The term ''tiáo'' refers to the vertical lines of authority over various sector reaching down from the ministries of the [[central government]].  ''Kuài'' refers to the horizontal level of authority of the territorial government at the provincial or local level. According to [[political scientist]] [[Kenneth Lieberthal]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/china-environment-series-11997 "China’s Governing System And Its Impact on Environmental Policy Implementation"] by Kenneth Lieberthal&lt;/ref&gt; "The former coordinates according to function ([for] example, environment); the latter coordinates according to the needs of the locality that it governs." Thus a local environmental protection bureau may have reporting responsibilities to both the central government's State Environmental Protection Administration and to the mayor of the city in which it is located.

Constitutionally, organizations in both the functional and territorial systems of governance are assigned to a system of ranks. Central ministries are at the same rank as provincial governments. Writes Lieberthal, "One key rule of the Chinese system is that units of the same rank cannot issue binding orders to each other.   Operationally, this means that no ministry can issue a binding order to a province."  This means a province may challenge, overrule, or ignore decisions made by a ministry. This [[two-dimensional]] arrangement sometimes creates undesirable [[Group conflict|conflicts]], and there have been calls for tiao-kuai integration ({{zh|c=条块结合|p=tiáo-kuài jiéhé}}), although this is unlikely to occur due to resistance from the provinces.

==Under Maoist rule==
In 1949, the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] established the [[People's Republic of China]], a constitutionally [[socialist state]]. While China experimented with centralization and decentralization policies for a few years, the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]] in 1957 solidified the principle of ideological unity among all local governments.&lt;ref name="Chung"&gt;{{cite book|title=Remaking the Chinese State: Strategies, Society, and Security|editor1-first=Jianmin|editor1-last=Zhao|editor2-first=Bruce|editor2-last=Dickson|chapter=Reappraising central-local relations in Deng's China|first=Jae Ho|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|last=Chung|pages=48–50, 53, 55, 57, 59–60, 62}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cultural Revolution]], and especially the 1971-1975 "unified income and unified expenditure" ({{lang|zh-hans|统收统支}}) period, bureaucrats across China implemented similar agricultural and industrial policies modeled in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name="Chung"/&gt;

==In the reform era==
With the death of [[Mao Zedong]] and the beginning of the [[Chinese economic reform]], China adopted a policy of "emancipation of mind (from ideology)" ({{lang|zh-hans|思想解放}}) as the government sought practical solutions to economic problems that reflected local conditions. Provinces were given substantial [[economic]] and [[political authority]], such as to authorize investment projects and raise their own taxes. The [[State Planning Commission of China|State Planning Commission]]'s mandate shifted from giving annual targets to planning for the medium and long term. The central government further established [[Special Economic Zones of the People's Republic of China|special economic zones]] within the coastal provinces, which the relevant subnational governments have operated and expanded upon, even establishing [[sister city]] relations internationally.&lt;ref name="Chung"/&gt;

Decentralization posed a problem for the central government in that the central government had no independent means of enforcing its authority to prevent local [[protectionism]] or enforce [[standardization|standard]]s. Hence in the 1990s, the PRC government began creating parallel central organizations to those of the provinces. Most of these organizations deal with economic [[regulation]]s. Devolution of political power to provincial People's Congresses have also occasionally caused vertical conflict, such as when Beijing appointed [[Ge Hongsheng]] as the [[Governor of Zhejiang]], who was [[vote of no confidence|voted out]] by the Zhejiang parliament in 1993. The central government now consults with provincial representatives before making sensitive personnel appointments.&lt;ref name="Chung"/&gt;

On the other hand, the rapid rise in the number of [[prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]] as a result of [[Urbanization in the People's Republic of China|urbanization]] has checked the power of the provinces. The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]]'s control over the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) also precludes the possibility of local separatists colluding with the military against the central government.&lt;ref name="Chung"/&gt;

==Comparisons to other countries==
An analogous situation can be seen in federal systems such as the [[United States]] where the [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] and [[State governments of the United States|state governments]] operate in parallel, but neither has the [[authority]] to [[wikt:command|command]] the other in relation to reserve powers or federal powers expressly delegated to the national government. Although the power relationships are similar the actual powers exercised can be quite different. For example, there are parallel institutions for [[police]] and financial securities regulation in the United States, but not in the PRC.

'''Tijuana bibles''' (also known as '''eight-pagers''', '''Tillie-and-Mac books''', '''Jiggs-and-Maggie books''', '''jo-jo books''', '''bluesies''', '''blue-bibles''', '''gray-backs''', and '''two-by-fours'''){{cn|date=June 2018}} were palm-sized pornographic comic books produced in the [[United States]] from the 1920s to the early 1960s. Their popularity peaked during the [[Great Depression]] era.

Most Tijuana bibles were obscene parodies of popular newspaper comic strips of the day, such as "[[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]]", "[[Barney Google]]", "[[Moon Mullins]]", "[[Popeye]]", "[[Tillie the Toiler]]", "[[The Katzenjammer Kids]]", "[[Dick Tracy]]", "[[Little Orphan Annie]]", and "[[Bringing Up Father]]". Others made use of characters based on popular movie stars, and sports stars of the day, such as [[Mae West]], [[Clark Gable]] and [[Joe Louis]], sometimes with names thinly changed. Before [[World War II]], almost all the stories were humorous and frequently were cartoon versions of well-known dirty jokes that had been making the rounds for decades.

The artists, writers, and publishers of these booklets are generally unknown, as their publication was illegal, clandestine, and anonymous. The quality of the artwork varied widely. The subjects are explicit sexual escapades usually featuring well-known newspaper comic strip characters, movie stars, and (rarely) political figures, invariably used without respect for either copyright or libel law and without permission.  Tijuana bibles repeated the [[ethnic stereotypes]] found in popular culture at the time, although one Tijuana bible ("You Nazi Man") concluded on a serious note with a brief message from the publisher pleading for greater tolerance in Germany for the Jews.&lt;ref name="StJames"/&gt;

The typical "bible" was an eight-panel comic strip in a wallet-sized 2.5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;inch format (approximately 7&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10.5&amp;nbsp;cm) with black print on cheap white paper and running eight pages in length.&lt;ref name = "StJames"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Heer | first = J  | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419101224 | title = Tijuana Bibles | journal = St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture | year = 2002 | publisher = Gale Group | accessdate = 2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiegelman2"&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Art Spiegelman |last=Spiegelman |first=A |title=Tijuana Bibles |publisher=[[Salon.com]]'' |date=1997-08-19 |url=http://www.salon.com/aug97/spieg2970819.html |accessdate=2009-02-24 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wzKg7r7s?url=http://www.salon.com/aug97/spieg2970819.html |archivedate=2011-03-06 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bright | first = S | title= Dogeared Style: Tijuana Bibles | publisher = [[Salon.com]] | date = 1997-08-19  | url = http://www.salon.com/books/feature/1997/08/19/tijuana/index1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==

[[Tillie the Toiler|Tillie and Mac]] are thought to have been the first Tijuana bible stars, along with [[Maggie and Jiggs]] from the popular newspaper strip ''Bringing Up Father''. Tillie was soon followed by [[Winnie Winkle]], [[Dumb Dora]], [[Dixie Dugan]], [[Fritzi Ritz]], [[Ella Cinders]], and other familiar comic strip characters stamped in the same mold. [[Popeye]] and [[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]] were the most popular cartoon characters appearing in Tijuana bibles in the 1930s, judging by the number of their appearances. The first celebrity bibles were based on real-life newspaper tabloid sex scandals such as the [[Peaches Browning|Peaches and Daddy Browning]] case which made headlines in 1926. Ten years later, an entire series of bibles by one unknown artist obscenely lampooned [[Wallis Simpson|Mrs. Wallis Simpson]] and the King of England. By far the most popular celebrity character was Mae West, but virtually every major Hollywood star of the era was featured in the Tijuana bibles, obscenely and libelously.

A popular comic strip character such as Tillie or Blondie might appear in as many as 40 different eight-pagers drawn by ten different artists. An entire series of ten bibles drawn by Mr. Prolific was based on famous gangsters; [[Jack Diamond (gangster)|Legs Diamond]], [[Al Capone]], and [[Machine Gun Kelly]] were featured, while the artist working under the alias "Elmer Zilch" drew a set of eight comics about famous boxers such as [[Jack Dempsey]]. Another set of ten bibles drawn by Prolific featured radio stars, including [[Joe Penner]] and [[Kate Smith]]. Blackjack drew a set of ten comics using characters from [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]], with each of the seven dwarfs starring in his own X-rated title.

[[File:Rubber_salesman_ornate_design.jpg|thumb|240px|left|"The Rubber Salesman" (ca. 1935), drawn in the hand of "Elmer Zilch", showing the "Ornate Border" design.]]The ten book series format was dictated by the limitations of the printing equipment used to print the bibles, which made it convenient to print a set of ten titles at a time, side by side on a large sheet which was then cut into strips, collated, folded, and stapled. Typically, a new set of ten would be issued every couple of months, all drawn by the same artist, featuring ten different cartoon characters or celebrities. For several months in 1935, Elmer Zilch and his publishers experimented with a ten-page format, issued with two-tone covers in four sets of eight, plus one set of ten (the "Salesmen" series) in the eight-page format. Each panel in this series was surrounded by an intricate engraved arabesque border, possibly intended as an anti-counterfeiting device as it was hard to reproduce, and the series became known to collectors as the "Ornate Borders" series. Only 42 bibles are known by collectors to have been issued in this style, and most of them were soon being reprinted in truncated 8-page versions. Often the added two pages were simply filler gag panels drawn by Zilch.

In addition to comic strip characters and celebrities, many bibles featured nameless stock characters like cab drivers, firemen, traveling salesmen (and farmer's daughters), icemen, maids, and the like. Very few original recurring characters were created expressly for the bibles; Mr. Prolific's "[[Fuller Brush Company|Fuller Brush Man]]" was one, in which a door-to-door salesman named Ted starred in a series of ten episodic eight-page adventures. To many collectors, this series was the epitome of the Tijuana bible genre.[[File:Tjbfullerbrush1.jpg|thumb|240px|right|The first 8-page installment of ''The Adventures of a Fuller Brush Man'', published circa 1936.]] During the Senate racket investigations of the 1950s, a New York businessman named Abe Rubin was asked if there was any truth to the rumor picked up by a Chicago police lieutenant that he had once been the original printer and distributor of "the Fuller Brush Man series of comics." The Fuller Brush man stories made a very weak stab at continuity (e.g., "The following week I was sent to Tallahassee" or some such words at the commencement of each installment), but each 8-panel story was self-contained. The only real serial stories told in the eight-pager format were three tales by Blackjack, featuring original characters named Fifi, Maizie, and Tessie, in "To be continued" narratives which stretched through three or four installments each before concluding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tijuanabible.org/articles/blackjackswaywardgirls.html "Blackjack's Wayward Girls: A Guide to the Fifi/Mazie/Tessie Tijuana Bibles"] ''tijuanabible.org''.

==History==
The term "Tijuana bibles" was first noted in Southern California in the late 1940s&lt;ref&gt;Cray, Ed. "Ethnic and Place Names as Derisive Adjectives," ''Western Folklore'', January 1962, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the apocryphal belief that they were manufactured and smuggled across the border from [[Tijuana]], [[Mexico]]. In the 1930s, many early bibles bore phony imprints of non-existent companies such as "London Press", "La France Publishing," and "Tobasco Publishing Co." in London, Paris, and Havana. The popular line using the "Tobasco" imprint was around the underground market for a couple of years and also printed a number of pamphlet-sized erotic fiction readers, in addition to about 60 Tijuana bible titles, most of them original.

Tijuana bibles were sold under the counter for 25 cents in places where men congregated: barrooms, bowling alleys, garages, tobacco shops, barber shops, and burlesque houses.  One commentator reminisces:

{{quote|I came of age during the war and served in the United States Navy, and I recall seeing them behind the counter at magazine stands and bus terminals, in penny arcades, and in dusty little second-hand bookshops.  During their last years of production, the late 1950s and early 1960s, the little second-hand book and curio shops seem to have been their primary distribution outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hoffman | first= Frank A. | chapter = Humor in the Eight-Pagers | title = Sex and Humor: Selections from the Kinsey Institute | publisher = [[Indiana University Press]] | year = 2002 | pages= 13–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In some senses, Tijuana bibles were the first [[underground comix]].  They featured original material at a time when legitimate American comic books were still reprinting newspaper strips.  After [[World War II]], both the quality and the popularity of the Tijuana bible declined.&lt;ref name="Spiegelman2"/&gt;

[[File:Tjb-diagonal-set-covers.jpg|thumb|240px|right|A set of Tijuana bibles drawn by "Mr. Prolific". This set was released in 1936 and usually sold for a quarter each. Nine of the ten comics in the set are shown.]]
Comics artist and historian [[Art Spiegelman]] notes that records do not seem to exist of prosecutions against publishers and artists for making Tijuana bibles; the cartoonist added, however, that authorities occasionally seized shipments and people selling Tijuana bibles. According to Spiegelman, it's not clear whether [[mom and pop]] outfits or [[organized crime]] created the small salacious booklets.&lt;ref name="Spiegelman2"/&gt; Old newspaper crime stories seem to indicate that most bibles were the product of a fairly small group of independent small businessmen with their own printing presses, invariably springing up again in a new location after a police raid shut them down.  These businessmen manufactured a variety of pornographic products, including pornographic playing cards, gag greeting cards, and film reels, and created their own underground distribution routes around the United States.

In the early days, Tijuana bibles could be shipped in bulk around the country through commercial express offices, usually the [[Railway Express Agency]] firm. It was a serious criminal offense to send them via the US mail, and one mail order dealer was sentenced to 5 years in [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|Leavenworth]] in 1932 for simply soliciting orders from his customers through the US mail (at a dollar per bible: "These are not the cheap kind"), even though he guaranteed to ship them by commercial express.&lt;ref&gt;Linderman, Jim. ''True History of the Tijuana Bibles: Facts and Myths'', (Blurb, 2013), p. 35-43&lt;/ref&gt;  When the mails were used, complex schemes were used to foil postal inspectors, involving mail-forwarding, one-time use postal boxes, and non-existent addresses. The high success rate of the postal authorities in defeating these schemes is the main reason that bibles were generally sold locally rather than through the mails. When a seller was arrested and prosecuted for violating a local ordinance, the penalties were far lower than if a federal offense was committed; usually a seller got off with a 30-day sentence, a $100 fine, or probation after a local arrest, at least on a first offense.

Easy access to commercial shipping was suddenly cut off in the mid-1930s, so manufacturers began driving the products themselves to various underground depots around the country in cars and vans, taking advantage of a loophole making it not a federal crime (at that time) to take pornography across state lines in a private vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, George. "How Movie Stars Are Used in Obscene Booklet Racket", ''National Police Gazette'', Oct. 1955. Retrieved Sept. 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The small size of the bibles made them easy to transport; 50,000 bibles could fit in the trunk of a car. Clandestine distribution centers were located in basements, lofts, and back alley garages in a chain of large cities on an east-west axis from New York City to Kansas City, loosely following the route of the old [[National Road]] and generally avoiding the South and New England which were regarded as dangerous places to be arrested for pornography. (Boston's [[Scollay Square]], however, was a notorious place where Tijuana bibles could readily be purchased at seedy, hole-in-the-wall novelty shops patronized by sailors on leave.)  Business was always done on a strictly cash basis, with generous discounts for bulk purchases to the local distributors who then resold them to retail vendors. The local distributors were not members of organized crime syndicates, but seedy small businessmen in an illegal black market business. The same vendors also handled cheap, off-brand black market condoms. A distributor's "territory" might be a large city, several counties, or an entire state, with the territorial boundaries being assigned by the national distributors, who regulated things by limiting the amount of goods delivered to each local distributor to the quantity that could readily be sold inside his (or in at least one instance, her) assigned territory.&lt;ref&gt;''Juvenile Delinquency (Obscene and Pornographic Materials).

[[File:Wally-tjb-6.jpg|thumb|right|One of a set of 10 Tijuana bibles issued in 1936 obscenely lampooning Mrs. [[Wallis Simpson]].]]
Millions of Tijuana bibles were printed and sold in the 1930s, the heyday of the bibles. But the number of new Tijuana bible titles being produced took a nosedive at the beginning of World War II, and the industry never recovered. Factors in the decline of the Tijuana bibles at this time may have included police raids and the retirement of Doc Rankin, who was called up by the military at the beginning of the war, along with wartime shortages of paper and printing supplies. Printing plates of older bibles were worn down through continued reprintings until they were nearly blank, and original plates lost in police raids had to be replaced with new plates crudely recut by hamfisted, untrained amateur engravers. The quality of Tijuana bibles available on the market suffered, and prices dropped as sales plummeted.

When the business was revived after the war, the quality of new bibles was dismal: both poorly drawn and badly printed. They were amateurish and puerile compared to the work of a decade before. Mr. Dyslexic, the leading artist of the postwar era, was possessed of an almost staggering lack of drawing talent matched only by his bad taste and ignorance of the English language.&lt;ref&gt;Spiegelman, Art. "Those Dirty Little Books" in ''Tijuana Bibles: Art and Wit in America's Forbidden Funnies'', ed. Bob Adelman, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1997, p. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; His best-known work "Traveling Preacher" is a lengthy, labored-over retelling of a novel by [[Erskine Caldwell]] (''Journeyman''), whom Mr. Dyslexic then proceeded to acknowledge by making Caldwell himself the star of another scabrous Tijuana bible ("Erskine Caldwell in ''Grandpa's Revenge''").

==Artists==

Little is known about the anonymous artists who produced the Tijuana bibles.  [[Wesley Morse]] (who later went on to draw ''[[Bazooka Joe]]'') is believed to have drawn many of those appearing shortly before WWII, most notably about a dozen titles inspired by the [[1939 New York World's Fair|1939 World's Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Yoe, Craig |title=Clean Cartoonists' Dirty Drawings |publisher=Last Gasp |location=San Francisco, CA | year= 2007 |page= 72 |isbn= 978-0-86719-653-5 |oclc= |doi= | accessdate= | url = https://books.google.com/?id=M9GTWlMjBqYC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morse was the only major Tijuana bible artist who did not parody the newspaper comic strips, preferring to create his own characters. A number of books have alleged that freelance cartoonist [[Doc Rankin]] was the creator of numerous Tijuana bibles in the 1930s, although this remains unproven.&lt;ref name="StJames" /&gt; [[Gershon Legman]] was around the New York City erotic book trade in the 1930s, and he claimed that Rankin was paid $35 weekly to produce two eight pagers, delivering the work to Louis Shomer, a gadfly book trade personality and publisher of a line of cheap pamphlet-sized jokebooks, chiefly remembered today for testifying against Ben Rebhuhn at the Falstaff Press pornography trial and as the author of a manual of tap-dancing. In addition to his identification of Rankin, Legman also claimed to know that one of the major Tijuana bible artists was a woman, possibly referring to Blackjack, who drew inspiration from movie star fan magazines, both for story ideas and for visual reference, for titles like ''William Powell and Myrna Loy in "Nuts to Will Hays!"''. Blackjack followed the storylines of the daily newspaper comics closely and satirized them: the plot and characters of ''Annie and Rose in "Doughnut Girls Fill Up the Holes!"'' fits right in to the 1938 story arc in which Little Orphan Annie and her grownup friend Rose Chance tried to beat the Depression by starting a doughnut-making business. Blackjack's two baseball-themed bibles, featuring New York Yankees [[Joe Dimaggio]], [[Lou Gehrig]] and [[Lefty Gomez]], show a good awareness of the latest tabloid gossip about the Yankees' love lives as of spring training 1937, although the pairing of Lou Gehrig with Mae West seems to be purely a figment of Blackjack's imagination.

[[File:tillie-mac-pg1.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Panel from a "Tillie and Mac" Tijuana bible strip drawn by "Elmer Zilch".]]
Collectors have assigned names to several anonymous artists with recognizable styles: "Mr. Prolific", the creator of the "Adventures of a Fuller Brush Man" series, and the master of a sure-handed, elegant steel-pen inking style, sometimes said to have been Rankin; "Mr. Dyslexic", a seemingly clumsy, semi-literate artist who produced numerous titles in the postwar period, some with political content (e.g., Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] breaking a strike by sleeping with union members' wives); "Blackjack", whose work frequently depicted imaginary pairings of famous Hollywood movie stars, and featured large solid black areas and often resembled linoleum block prints; and "Elmer Zilch" (also known as "Artist No. 4"), an early and witty creator of the 1930s who rivaled Mr. Prolific in talent, popularity, and productivity, and who may also have been Rankin.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmore, Donald H. ''Sex in Comics'', Greenleaf Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Rankin had a studio in midtown Manhattan where he produced commercial artwork on commission, so there is the possibility that assistants were involved.

Commentators have claimed to discern the styles of from a dozen to twenty different artists who produced 10 or more bibles during their heyday, with the most productive artists (Mr. Prolific and Elmer Zilch) each drawing from 150 to 200 titles; followed by the output of Wesley Morse, Blackjack, and Mr. Dyslexic, who each produced about half that many. These five artists may have drawn half of all the Tijuana bibles ever done. There were also two anonymous artists in the 1950s who each drew about 60 to 80 cheaply produced titles, sold for a dime each to a clientele which allegedly consisted largely of high school boys. These late-period bible series included such titles as "Bellhop Kicks Dog" and a number of "Archie"-themed comics.

A few observers believe that Mr. Prolific and Elmer Zilch may even have been the same artist working in two different styles to vary his output and extend his shelf life. The byline "Elmer Zilch" appears on a number of Tijuana bibles which evidently came on the market in 1934 and 1935, and the same artist's unmistakable "big-foot" cartoony style can be seen in many more. The name "Elmer Zilch" referred to a fictional character who was the mascot of the humor magazine ''[[Ballyhoo (magazine)|Ballyhoo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tijuanabible.org/articles/birth-of-the-8-pager-by-donald-h-gilmore-phd.html "Birth of the 8-Pager" by Donald H.

Retrieved July 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The total number of distinct stories produced is unknown but has been estimated by Art Spiegelman to be between 700 and 1,000. These were endlessly reprinted, redrawn, retitled, and pirated, with nearly illegible "nth-generation" copies circulating decades after the originals were first issued.

In addition to the eight-pagers, there were also the more expensive "16-pagers", printed in a larger page size with more pages, and usually more carefully drawn and better printed. These were high-priced and less common than the 8-pagers but showcased the artists' best work.

[[File:Poughkeepsie_Eagle_News_Feb_12_1930.jpg|thumb|380px|right|A rare early newspaper headline: In 1930 the sale of two Tijuana bibles for 25 cents each, in the tiny mountain hamlet of [[Dover Plains]], was front page news. (Feb. 12, 1930 ''Poughkeepsie Eagle News'')]]
One of the earliest known Tijuana bible arrests occurred in [[Terre Haute]] in 1926, when a cache of bibles was discovered in a school locker at Wiley High School. Police traced the source back to a highly respected local newspaper editor named Charles Jewett (managing editor of the ''Terre Haute Star'') and his son, a job printer.&lt;ref&gt;Roznowski, Tom. ''An American Hometown: Terre Haute, Indiana, 1927.'' (Indiana Univ. Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; A federal charge was also placed against them because some of the bibles had been shipped across state lines to Rochester, Minn.&lt;ref&gt;"Father and Son Accused", ''Indianapolis News'', June 9, 1926. page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; "Jewett was arrested following an investigation by authorities of the origin of a book of indecent pictures in which popular comic strip characters figure,” a local newspaper reported.&lt;ref&gt;"Former Local Man Arrested. Charles Jewett and Son Face Charges." ''Logansport Morning Press'' (Logansport, Ind.), June 9, 1926, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  "The arrests grew out of an investigation, which had been quietly going on for three or four weeks, following the finding that several Wiley high school boys were in possession of an obscene publication based on a current strip in the Sunday papers.  Further inquiry led to a search of the printing offices conducted by Jackson Jewett, under the name of the Jewett Printing Company, where a number of zinc etchings, from which the strips were printed, together with a quantity of booklets, bound and ready for distribution, were seized. It was said at the time that the elder Jewett had taken the contract for printing the strips and had attended to their distribution."&lt;ref&gt;"Arrest Terre Haute Men for Distributing Obscene Literature", ''The Huntington (Indiana) Press'', June 8, 1926, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Jewett was sentenced to six months in a state workhouse, and father and son left Terre Haute afterward.  It is not known today which particular bibles were involved, but the earliest bibles are sometimes dated to 1925, particularly early "Tillie and Mac" and "Maggie and Jiggs" stories which were issued without covers or titles at the time, and were not always 8 pages long. The [[Kinsey Institute]] has in its possession an early Tillie and Mac story involving Mac finding a used condom in Tillie's wastebasket ("I wondered where that had gone," she says brightly), which has an archivist's notation "First seen Oklahoma 1926."

On the rare occasions that the Tijuana bibles were mentioned in the press, they were usually described vaguely and without identifying detail as "cartoon books," an ambiguous term that could just as easily refer to licensed collections of newspaper strips such as the [[Cupples &amp; Leon]] reprint books. People would order "cartoon books" from the mysterious and ambiguously worded advertisements that appeared in the back pages of the [[National Police Gazette|''Police Gazette'']] starting in the late 1920s, but they had no way of knowing which they would receive. Buyers were sometimes advised to "state explicitly what you want." If a news story concerned a police raid, a clarifying adjective might be employed, such as "indecent," "lewd", or "obscene", as in the following 1930 news item about an arrest in midtown Manhattan:

{{quote|"Benjamin White, salesman, residing at the Hotel Wellington, was held for trial in Special Sessions when waiving examination on the charge of possessing countless allegedly indecent "cartoon" books, pictures and literature. White posted bond of $500. He was arrested in his apartment by detective William Amos of Chief Inspector O'Brien's staff and [[John S. Sumner]] and Charles Bamberger, of the [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice|Vice Society]]. The Vice crusaders received complaints hundreds of indecent small paper covered books were being sold on the streets. Bamberger and Amos investigated.  They asserted that they came from White's apartment at the Wellington.    By a subterfuge, they gained entrance to his room.  Books and literature were seized and White arrested.    Amos and Bamberger stated to reporters that the source of the books and papers was in [[Cohoes, New York|Cohoes, N.Y.]]   White, they alleged, had the stuff shipped here."&lt;ref&gt;"Ben White Taken in For Indecent Pictures", ''Variety'', November 5, 1930, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The scale on which Tijuana bibles were produced can be gauged from the large hauls announced in police seizures. Eight million bibles were reported seized in one November 1942 raid by [[FBI]] agent [[Percy E. Foxworth|P.E. Foxworth]] and his men on a New York City warehouse and a printing plant in the [[South Bronx]]. Small time businessmen Jacob and David Brotman were arrested in that raid, along with several associates.&lt;ref&gt;"5 Seized by FBI as Lewd Book Ring. Group That is Said to Have Sold Tons of Obscenity to Youths Reported Broken", ''New York Times'', Nov. 24, 1942, p. 27. FBI assistant director and New York City bureau chief P.E. Foxworth's main responsibility at the time was conducting mass roundups of German-Americans suspected of Nazi sympathies. He died two months later in the same South American plane crash that killed novelist [[Eric Knight]].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the FBI, four tons of material were ready to ship across the country, and seven tons had already gone out and were being rounded up at regional distribution centers in [[Baltimore]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Cleveland]]/[[Akron]], [[Indianapolis]], and [[Kansas City]]. Jacob Brotman was identified as one of the main players in the Tijuana bible trade in Jay Gertzman's ''Bookleggers and Smuthounds'', and he had previously been arrested in a similar raid on a Lower East Side loft reported in the New York City papers in 1936 which produced a large haul of bibles, erotic fiction "readers", pornographic playing cards, and nude photos, along with cutting and binding equipment and an expensive modern printing press which police could not confiscate because it turned out to be leased. The firm had been operating under the guise of a playing card manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;"Obscene Library Raided by Police.

Sumner", ''New York Times'', March 28, 1936, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1939 World's Fair, men selling pornographic booklets on the midway at the fair were trailed to a warehouse near the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] where David Brotman and an associate were arrested and a cache was seized of 350,000 printed items and photos and 50,000 condoms, along with printing plates.&lt;ref&gt;"Raid Nets Two as Cops Seize Obscene Books", ''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', July 18, 1939; cited in Jay Gertzman, ''Bookleggers and Smuthounds''.&lt;/ref&gt; Collectors have estimated that as many as 50,000 copies would be produced of a single title in this period, and distributed around the country through an underground network of independent local and regional distributors, many of them former bootleggers.

If the distributor did not cross a state line while making his rounds, it was very difficult to charge him (or her, in a few cases) with a Federal offense, although in the Hepler case authorities were able to sentence him to five years in the [[Atlanta Penitentiary]]—not for distributing pornography, but on the charge that he had cheated his business partner on the proceeds.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Courtney Ryley. ''Designs in Scarlet'' (Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1939), p. 248-250.&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York City, police raids on the business were carried out at intervals for decades, usually at the instigation of [[John S. Sumner]] and the [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]], which closely watched the trade in pornography in the city during the years of its existence. In Boston, this function was carried out by the [[Watch and Ward Society]], which exchanged information with Sumner's organization in New York to coordinate their efforts. There was also a similar group in Chicago, the Illinois Vigilance Association led by Rev. Philip Yarrow.&lt;ref&gt;"Police Arrest Two, and Seize Obscene Films and Cartoons", ''Chicago Tribune'', April 28, 1938, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Prolific mocks these foes in one of his bibles, in the form of a guardian of public morals named "Smuthound" who apprehends Betty Boop while she is engaged in having sex with a lifeguard on the beach (''Betty Boop in "Improvising"'').

The FBI monitored the Tijuana bible trade but rarely made arrests. A large file of specimen bibles was maintained at FBI headquarters, eventually comprising over 5,000 items, for the purpose of tracing printers and distributors.&lt;ref&gt;Charles, Douglas M. ''The FBI´s Obscene File: J. Edgar Hoover and the Bureau´s Crusade Against Smut.'' (University Press of Kansas, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wimpy TJB.jpg|thumb|380px|right|The cover of a typical Tijuana bible, this one features [[J. Wellington Wimpy|Wimpy]], and is drawn in the style of the anonymous "Mr. Prolific".]]
Early in the graphic novel ''[[Watchmen]]'', the current Silk Spectre (Laurie Juspeczyk) visits her mother (past Silk Spectre Sally Jupiter) and briefly reads a Tijuana bible featuring her&lt;!---who? Sally or Laurie?---&gt;. Sally finds it flattering and keeps it as a reminder of her past sex appeal, but Laurie finds the comic obscene.  The same Tijuana bible is later given away as a gift, owing to its present nature as a collector's novelty item.

[[Will Eisner]] features Tijuana bibles in the first pages of his book ''[[The Dreamer (graphic novel)|The Dreamer]]'', though nothing explicit is shown. His protagonist Billy is a young artist out looking for work who is offered a job illustrating them by a printer and a mobster. He is shocked and incensed and asks if they are legal. The vignette serves to focus conflict between the character's dream and reality, but also between legitimate and illicit comic production. Dejected, Billy says that he will think it over.&lt;ref&gt;Eisner, Will, (1986).  Pgs 5–6. ''The Dreamer'' {{ISBN|978-0-393-32808-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme is reminiscent of a real-life episode described by Eisner about being asked by a shady Brooklyn businessman to draw for the publications at a rate of $3 a page, which was good money at the time.

[[Joe Shuster]] drew Tijuana bible-like illustrations for an underground bondage-themed erotic series called ''Nights of Horror'' in the early 1950s. His male characters are strongly reminiscent of [[Superman]], and some of his female characters resemble [[Lois Lane]]. Thousands of copies of ''Nights of Horror'' were seized in a police raid on a Times Square book store, but Shuster's name did not come to light in the ensuing prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yoe, Craig |author2=Shuster, Joe |author3=Lee, Stan |title=Secret Identity: The Fetish Art of Superman's Co-creator Joe Shuster|publisher=Abrams ComicArts |year=2009|pages=|isbn=978-0-8109-9634-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Colton | first = D | title = 'Superman' artist's bizarro world exposed | publisher = [[USA Today]] | date = 2009-04-13 | accessdate = 2009-04-22 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20090413/superracy13_st.art.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young [[Hugh Hefner]] experimentally drew several Tijuana bibles as samples for a projected series which was never published, when he was a struggling cartoonist in Chicago in the early 1950s, around the same time that he issued his self-published cartoon book ''That Toddlin' Town.''&lt;ref&gt;Brady, Frank. ''Hefner: An unauthorized biography.'' New York: Macmillan, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

The title character in the semi-autobiographical Canadian novel ''[[The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (novel)|The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz]]'' (1959) by [[Mordecai Richler]] sells Tijuana bibles to his high school classmates, some featuring ''[[Dick Tracy]]'', after buying them in bulk from a newsstand vendor who assigns him a small part of the city as his sales territory. He hears that the news vendor has been arrested, then panics and destroys all the bibles.

In the novel ''[[Water for Elephants]]'', the term "eight-pager" is mentioned in several different locations, one of these when Kinko the dwarf is caught masturbating by Jacob Jankowski while reading a ''[[Popeye the Sailor]]'' Tijuana bible.

The novel ''[[The Green Mile (novel)|The Green Mile]]'' feature a scene in which guard Percy Wetmore is caught reading a Tijuana bible with fictional character "Lotta Leadpipe", and is asked what his mother would think of such material; this is included in [[The Green Mile (film)|the film version]].

A 1954 episode of ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]'' ("The Big Producer")  had Sgt. Joe Friday breaking up a high school smut ring which includes a teenage boy (played by [[Martin Milner]]) selling eight-pagers out of his school locker. They are called "joke books" by the seller. The term "Tijuana Bible" was used in the 1968 ''Dragnet'' episode "The Starlet".

During Year Six (2007) of the [[webcomic]] ''Something Positive'', lead character Davan MacIntire discovers that the man whom he is named after, a cousin of his grandfather, had worked as a writer/artist of Tijuana bibles in the late 1930s. [[Randy Milholland]], the creator of ''Something Positive'', then created a spin-off series called ''Something Positive 1937''&lt;ref&gt;Archive: http://www.somethingpositive.net/1937archive.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; to tell the story of the first Davan.

In the graphic novel [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]] the titular Dossier contains a mock Tijuana bible (actually printed in cheap newsprint and included with the book &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://ew.com/article/2007/10/18/first-look-alan-moores-new-graphic-novel/ | last = Jensen | first = J | title = First Look: Alan Moore's new graphic novel | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 2007-10-18 | accessdate = 2018-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) which, in the context of the story, was published by a ministry from the government of [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]] (of [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]] fame), dubbed Pornsec by authors [[Alan Moore]] and [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]].

In 2008, comic artists [[Ethan Persoff]] and Scott Marshall created an eight-page mock Tijuana Bible lampooning President [[George W. Bush]] and Presidential hopeful [[John McCain]] entitled ''Obliging Lady''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ep.tc/mccain-bible 1934 George Bush John McCain Tijuana Bible]&lt;/ref&gt;  The comic was distributed at the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2008/08/26/bushmccain-tijuana-b.html |title=Bush-McCain 'Tijuana Bibles' at the Democratic National Convention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gramatika i stilistika hrvatskoga ili srpskoga knjizevnoga jezika.JPG|thumb|Tomo Maretić: ''Gramatika i stilistika hrvatskoga ili srpskoga književnog jezika'']]

'''Tomislav Maretić''' (13 October 1854 – 15 January 1938) was a [[Croat]]ian linguist and lexicographer.&lt;ref name="HE"&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://enciklopedija.hr/Natuknica.aspx?ID=38853 |contribution=Maretić, Tomislav (Tomo) |title=[[Croatian Encyclopedia]] |year=1999–2009 |accessdate=January 19, 2014 |publisher=[[Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža]] |language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Virovitica]], where he attended primary school and the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Varaždin]], [[Požega, Croatia|Požega]] and Zagreb. After graduating simultaneously Slavistics and Classical Philology at the [[Faculty of Philosophy, Zagreb|Philosophical Faculty]] of the [[University of Zagreb]] in a three-year program, he passes his teacher exam for high-school teaching of [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] as primary, and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] as a secondary course. In 1877 he works as a probationary, and since 1880 as an assistant teacher in Velika gimnazija in Zagreb. He received his Ph.D. in 1884 in [[Slavic studies]] and philosophy with the thesis ''O nekim pojavama kvantitete i akcenta u jeziku hrvatskom ili srpskom'' ("On some changes of quantity and accent in Croatian or Serbian language"). He further specialized in postdoctoral studies at the neogrammarian centers of [[Leipzig]] and [[Prague]].

He was appointed [[professor extraordinarius]] for "Slavic philology with particular emphasis on
Croatian and Serbian history of language and literature" in 1886 (since 1890 ordinary professor and [[JAZU]] member). In 1892 at the electional list of Magyar unionist party he was elected as a representative of [[Gospić]], and since 1900 of [[Slunj]] kotar. In the period 1915 - 1918 he served as the president of JAZU, and twice as the head of the philological-historical class of the Academy, first from 1906–1913, then a second time from 1919-1928.

As a gymnasium student he published short literary works (signing as ''Tomislav''). In the 1880s he focused on Croatian orthography and alphabet issues, having published a few papers on it (the study ''"Historija hrvatskoga pravopisa latinskijem slovima"'') in which he was laying foundations for the acceptance of phonologically-based orthography. At the end of the 19th century he published two grammars: the "academic" (''"Gramatika i stilistika hrvatskoga ili srpskoga književnog jezika"'') and gymnasium (''"Gramatika hrvatskoga jezika za niže razrede srednjih škola"'', both in 1899) version, in which he completely directed grammatical norm of the Croatian literary language towards [[Štokavian#Accentuation|Neoštokavian]]. Those two grammars represent the final confrontation with the competing conception of [[standard language]] advocated by [[Zagreb philological school]]. Beside [[Ivan Broz]], he was among the first [[Shtokavian]] purists.

In 1907 he became editor of the massive dictionary compiled by the Academy, and until his death (from the lexeme ''maslo'' up to the lexeme ''pršutina'') he has edited approximately 5 500 pages which makes him one of the most prolific Croatian lexicographers. He studied the language of [[Slavonia]]n and [[Dalmatia]]n writers and folk [[epic poetry|epics]]. He translated works from Polish, Latin and Ancient Greek, and some of the most well-known Croatian translations of the world's literature classics ([[Adam Mickiewicz|Mickiewicz]], [[Ovid]], [[Virgil]], [[Homer]]) are his work. In order to translate the classics he formed accentual [[hexameter]] which [[Petar Skok]] called ''"Maretić's life's work"''. By his beliefs Maretić is a [[Croatian Vukovian]], the advocate of the Croatian and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] linguistic unity and the usage of phonological orthography, idealizer of the ''"pure people's language"'' and of exclusively (Neo-)Štokavian basis of the Serbo-Croatian [[standard language]].

He died in [[Zagreb]].

A '''Writ of Kalikasan''' is a [[legal remedy]] under [[Philippines|Philippine]] law that provides protection of one's Constitutional right to a healthy environment, as outlined in Section 16, Article II of the [[Philippine Constitution]], which says the "state shall protect and advance the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology in accord with the rhythm and harmony of nature."&lt;ref name=Inquirer2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Inquirer Research|title=In the Know: Writ of kalikasan–Proudly Filipino|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/111233/in-the-know-writ-of-kalikasan-proudly-filipino|accessdate=17 September 2014|issue=Wednesday, September 17|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Kalikasan" is a Filipino word for "nature".&lt;ref name=Inquirer2014 /&gt;

The writ is comparable to the [[writ of amparo]] and the [[writ of habeas corpus]].&lt;ref name=Inquirer2014 /&gt;  In contrast, this writ protects one's right for a healthy environment rather than constitutional rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.shepheard-walwyn.co.uk/product/eradicating-ecocide/ | title=Eradicating ecocide: laws and governance to prevent the destruction of our planet | publisher=Shepheard-Walwyn | last=Higgins | first=Polly | year=2010 | location=London | isbn=978-0-85683-275-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writ of kalikasan is "proudly Philippine-made", unlike the other two writs that have roots in European and Latin American law.&lt;ref name=Inquirer2014 /&gt;

==History==
Provision for the Writ of Kalikasan was written in 2010 by the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] under Rule 7 of the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases as a Special Civil Action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chanrobles.com/scdecisions/rulesofcourt/2010/am_09-6-8-sc_2010.php A.M. No. 09-6-8-SC: April 13, 2010], Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases, Supreme Court of the Philippines.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court under [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Chief Justice]] [[Reynato Puno]] took the initiative and issued Rules of Procedure for Environmental Case because Section 16, Article II of the Philippines' 1986 Constitution was not a self-executing provision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://notocoal.weebly.com/writ-of-kalikasan.html#.T4tr17P9P0c What is a Writ of Kalikasan?], [http://notocoal.weebly.com/ notocoal.weebly.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases==
The writ of Kalikasan may be sought to deal with environmental damage of such magnitude that it threatens life, health, or property of inhabitants in two or more cities or provinces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj.org/dwn/img_prd/Philippines-ElecDist.pdf Access to Justice : Human Rights Abuses Involving Corporations], International Commission of Jurists, p. 17, {{ISBN|978-92-9037-148-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, the Philippine Supreme Court ruled unanimously against issuing a writ of kalikasan against the [[United States Government]] over the [[USS Guardian (MCM-5)#January 2013 grounding|grounding of the USS Guardian]] on the [[Tubbataha Reef]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=Inquirer2014 /&gt;
