{{tone|date=October 2015}}
An '''absurdity''' is a thing that is extremely [[reason|unreasonable]], so as to be [[Foolishness|foolish]] or not taken [[Seriousness|seriously]], or the state of being so. "Absurd" is an adjective used to describe an absurdity, e.g., "Tyler and the boys laughed at the absurdity of the situation." "this encyclopedia article is absurd".&lt;ref name=WD&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/absurd?show=0&amp;t=1296966875 Webster's Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from the Latin ''absurdum'' meaning "[[out of tune]]", hence irrational.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordreference.com/definition/absurdities Wordreference.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin ''surdus'' means "[[deaf]]", implying [[stupidity]].&lt;ref name=WD/&gt;
Absurdity is contrasted with [[seriousness]] in reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.com/browse/laughable Thesaurus.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In general usage, absurdity may be synonymous with [[ridiculous]]ness and [[nonsense]]. In specialized usage, absurdity is related to extremes in bad reasoning or pointlessness in reasoning; ridiculousness is related to extremes of incongruous juxtaposition, laughter, and ridicule; and nonsense is related to a lack of [[meaning (linguistics)|meaningfulness]]. [[Absurdism]] is a concept in philosophy related to the notion of absurdity.

== History ==
Absurdity has been used throughout western history regarding foolishness and extremely poor reasoning to form belief.&lt;ref name=AWTD&gt;Absurdities – Webster’s Timeline Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Ancient Greece ===
In [[Aristophanes]]' 5th century BC comedy ''[[The Wasps]]'', his protagonist [[Philocleon]] learned the "absurdities" of [[Aesop's Fables]], considered to be unreasonable fantasy, and not true.&lt;ref&gt;''The Wasps'', Parmenides&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] often used "absurdity" to describe very poor reasoning, or the conclusion from adopting a position that is false and reasoning to a false conclusion, called an "absurdity" (argument by reductio ad absurdum). Plato describes himself as not using absurd argumentation against himself in [[Parmenides]].&lt;ref&gt;''Parmenides'', Plato&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Gorgias]], Plato refers to an "inevitable absurdity" as the outcome of reasoning from a false assumption.&lt;ref&gt;''Gorgias'', Plato&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] rectified an irrational absurdity in reasoning with empiricism using [[likelihood]], "once the irrational has been introduced and an air of likelihood imparted to it, we must accept it in spite of the absurdity.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;Aristotle in Poetics, S.H. Butcher&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that absurdity in reasoning being veiled by charming language in poetry, "As it is, the absurdity is veiled by the poetic charm with which the poet invests it… But in the Epic poem the absurdity passes unnoticed."&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

=== Renaissance and early modern periods ===
[[Michel de Montaigne]], father of the [[essay]] and modern [[skepticism]], argued that the process of abridgement is foolish and produces absurdity, "Every abridgement of a good book is a foolish abridgement… absurdity &lt;nowiki&gt;[is]&lt;/nowiki&gt; not to be cured… satisfied with itself than any reason, can reasonably be."&lt;ref&gt;''The Essays of Michel De Montaigne'', Michel de Montaigne name&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Bacon]], an early promoter of [[empiricism]] and the scientific method, argued that absurdity should not always be laughed at, since it is a necessary component of scientific progress, where bold new ways of thinking and bold hypotheses often led to absurdity, "For if absurdity be the subject of laughter, doubt you but great [[WP:Bold|boldness]] is seldom without some absurdity."&lt;ref&gt;Essays, Francis Bacon&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hobbes' ''Table of Absurdity'' ====
[[Thomas Hobbes]] distinguished absurdity from errors, including basic linguistic errors as when a word is simply used to refer to something which does not have that name. According to [[Aloysius Martinich]]: "What Hobbes is worried about is absurdity. Only human beings can embrace an absurdity, because only human beings have language, and philosophers are more susceptible to it than others".&lt;ref name=HD&gt;{{Citation|last=Martinich|first=Aloysius|year=1995|title=Hobbes Dictionary|publisher=Blackwell}} page 27, citing ''[[Leviathan]]'' 5.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes wrote that "words whereby we conceive nothing but the sound, are those we call absurd, insignificant, and nonsense. And therefore if a man should talk to me of a round quadrangle; or, accidents of bread in cheese; or, immaterial substances; or of a free subject; a free will; or any free, but free from being hindered by opposition, I should not say he were in an error, but that his words were without meaning, that is to say, absurd".&lt;ref name=L&gt;''[[Leviathan]]'', [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=585&amp;layout=html#chapter_89826 Chapter V].&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguished seven types of absurdity. Below is the summary of Martinich, based on what he describes as Hobbes' "mature account" found in ''"De Corpore"'' 5., which all use examples that could be found in Aristotelian or scholastic philosophy, and all reflect "Hobbes' commitment to the new science of [[Galileo]] and [[William Harvey|Harvey]]". This is known as "Hobbes' Table of Absurdity".
#"Combining the name of a body with the name of an accident." For example, "existence is a being" or, "a being is existence". These absurdities are typical of [[scholastic philosophy]] according to Hobbes.
#"Combining the name of a body with the name of a phantasm." For example, "a ghost is a body".
#"Combining the name of a body with the name of a name." For example, "a universal is a thing".
#"Combining the name of an accident with the name of a phantasm." For example, "colour appears to a perceiver".
#"Combining the name of an accident with the name of a name." For example, "a definition is the [[essence]] of a thing".
#"Combining the name of a phantasm with the name of a name." For example, "the idea of a man is a universal".
#"Combining the name of a thing with the name of a speech act." For example, "some entities are beings ''per se''".

According to Martinich, [[Gilbert Ryle]] discussed the types of problem Hobbes refers to as absurdities under the term "[[category error]]".

Although common usage now considers "absurdity" to be synonymous with "[[ridiculous]]ness", Hobbes discussed the two concepts as different, in that absurdity is viewed as having to do with invalid reasoning,&lt;ref name=HD/&gt;&lt;ref name=L/&gt; while ridiculousness has to do with [[laughter]], [[superior (hierarchy)|superiority]], and [[deformity]].&lt;ref&gt;The Perception of Humor, Willibald Ruch, Emotions, qualia, and consciousness, Biocybernetics, VOl. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How Many Feminists Does It Take To Make A Joke?

== Demarcation with sound reasoning ==
Medical commentators have criticized  methods and reasoning in [[alternative and complementary medicine]] and [[integrative medicine]] as being either absurdities, or being between [[evidence]] and absurdity, often misleading the public with euphemistic terminology such as the expressions "alternative medicine" and "complementary medicine", and calling for a clear demarcation between valid scientific evidence and [[scientific method]]ology and absurdity.&lt;ref&gt;"Complementary and Alternative Medicine: Between Evidence and Absurdity", ''Perspectives in Biology and Medicine'', Volume 52, Number 2, Spring 2009, pp. 289–303, Edzard Ernst&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Propagation of the Absurd: demarcation of the Absurd revisited", Wallace Sampson, Kimball Atwood IV, ''The Medical Journal of Australia'', 183 (11/12)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Humor ==
{{Further|Theory of humor|Absurdist humor}}
{{quote|"I can see nothing" – Alice in Wonderland
::"My, you must have good eyes" – Cheshire Cat}}
Absurdity is used in [[theory of humor|humor]] to make people laugh or to make a sophisticated point, for example in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s "[[Jabberwocky]]", a poem of nonsense verse, originally featured as a part of his absurdist novel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]'' (1872); Carroll was a logician and parodied [[logic]] using illogic and inverting logical methods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/4334590 ''Wonderland Revisited'', Harry Levin]&lt;/ref&gt;
Argentine novelist [[Jorge Luis Borges]] used absurdities in his short stories to make points.&lt;ref&gt;''"to justify this 'absurdity' is the primordial object of this note"'', Labyrinths, Jorge Luis Borges, p. 39, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wtPxGztYx-UC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=Borges+Absurdity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yyqv5MUbM8&amp;sig=6wj59dP1zrXuD1kparLFIOpFkDY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=975VTbTSC4WosQOH2rH4BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franz Kafka]]'s ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'' is considered absurdist by some.&lt;ref&gt;"On the Absurdity of Kafka's Works from Transformer", G Yan-li, ''Journal of Yunyang Teachers College'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
[[Psychology|Psychologists]] study how humans adapt to constant absurdities in life.&lt;ref&gt;''The psychology of adaptation to absurdity: tactics of make-believe'', by Seymour Fisher, Rhoda Lee Fisher, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=kejcgoDXJDwC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=absurdity&amp;ots=eKERP2kuuX&amp;sig=ZpvYE8ZEzNwRGsxY_lT1nuopN9Q#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advertising ===
In [[advertising]], the presence or absence of an absurd image was found to moderate negative attitudes toward products and increase product recognition.&lt;ref&gt;"Effects of Absurdity in Advertising: The Moderating Role of Product Category Attitude and the Mediating Role of Cognitive Responses", ''Journal of Advertising'', 2000, Leopold Arias-Bolzmann, Goutam Chakraborty, John C. Mowen, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/4189133]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Rhetoric==
Absurdity arises when one’s own speech deviates from common sense, is too poetic, or when one is unable to defend themselves with speech and reason. In Aristotle’s book [[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]], Aristotle discusses the situations in which absurdity is employed and how it affects one’s use of persuasion. The idea of a man being unable to persuade someone by his words is absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Honeycutt|first=Lee|title=Aristotle's Rhetoric|url=http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet1-1.html|publisher=Alpine Lakes Design|accessdate=October 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008201141/http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet1-1.html|archive-date=2014-10-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle, a speech should not be too poetic because it imports absurdity and tastelessness to a speech. Any unnecessary information to the case is unreasonable and makes the speech unclear. If the speech becomes too unclear; the justification for their case becomes unpersuasive, making the argument absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Honeycutt|first=Lee|title=Aritotle's Rhetoric|url=http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet3-3.html|publisher=Alpine Lakes Design|accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Legal ==&lt;!--'Doctrine of absurdity' redirects here--&gt;
The absurdity doctrine is a legal theory in American courts.&lt;ref name=Scalia2012&gt;{{cite book |last1=Scalia |first1=Antonin  |last2=Garne |first2=Bryan A.  |date=2012 |title=Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts|trans-title= |url= |format= |language= |location= |publisher= |isbn=9780314275554 |via= |subscription= |quote=A provision may be either disregarded or judicially corrected as an error (when the correrection is textually simple) if failing to do so would result in a disposition that no reasonable person could approve.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|234-239}} One type of absurdity, known as the "[[Clerical error|scrivener's error]]", occurs when simple textual correction is needed to amend an obvious clerical error, such as a misspelled word.&lt;ref name=Scalia2012/&gt;{{rp|234-235}} Another type of absurdity, called "evaluative absurdity", arises when a legal provision, despite appropriate spelling and grammar, "makes no substantive sense". An example would be a statute that mistakenly provided for a ''winning'' rather than ''losing'' party to pay the other side's reasonable attorney's fees.&lt;ref name=Scalia2012/&gt;{{rp|235-237}} In order to stay within the remit of [[textualism]] and not reach further into [[purposivism]], the doctrine is restricted by two limiting principles: "...the absurdity and the injustice of applying the provision to the case would be so monstrous, that all mankind would, without hesitation, unite in rejecting the application"&lt;ref&gt;Story, Joseph.

== Philosophy ==
{{Further|Absurdism}}
It is illogical to seek purpose or meaning in an uncaring world without purpose or meaning, or to accumulate excessive wealth in the face of certain death. Absurdity is used in existentialist and related philosophy to describe absurdly pointless efforts to try to find such meaning or purpose in an objective and uncaring world, a philosophy known as [[absurdism]].{{cn|date=October 2016}}

In his paper, ''The Absurd'', [[Thomas Nagel]] analyzed the perpetual absurdity of human life. Absurdity in life becomes apparent when we realize the fact that we take our lives seriously, while simultaneously perceiving that there is a certain arbitrarity in everything we do.  He suggests never to stop searching for the absurd.  Furthermore, he suggests searching for irony amongst the absurdity.{{cn|date=October 2016}} 
=== Philosophy of language ===
{{Further|Moore's paradox}}
[[G. E. Moore]], an English [[Analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]], cited as a paradox of language such superficially absurd statements as, "I went to the pictures last Tuesday but I don't believe it", which can be true and logically consistent, and which are not contradictory on further consideration of the user's linguistic intent. [[Wittgenstein]] observes that in some unusual circumstances absurdity itself disappears in such statements, as there are cases where "It is raining but I don't believe it" can make sense, i.e., what appears to be an absurdity is not nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgensteinian Accounts of Moorean Absurdity,  Philosophical Studies, Volume 92, Number 3, John N. Williams, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/t77l87484l2860mu/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theater of the Absurd ===
The [[Theater of the Absurd]] was a [[surrealist]] movement demonstrating [[motif (narrative)|motif]]s of absurdism.

== Logic and computer science ==
=== ''Reductio ad absurdum'' ===
[[Reductio ad absurdum]], reducing to an absurdity, is a method of proof in polemics, logic and [[mathematics]], whereby assuming that a proposition is true leads to absurdity; a proposition is assumed to be true and this is used to deduce a proposition known to be false, therefore the original proposition must have been false. It is also an argumentation style in [[polemics]], whereby a position is demonstrated to be false, or "absurd", by assuming it and reasoning to reach something known to be believed to be false or to violate common sense; e.g., as used by Plato to argue against other philosophical positions.&lt;ref&gt;The History of Reduction to Absurdity, Yao-yong, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
An [[absurdity constraint]] is used in the logic of [[model transformation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A Constructive Approach to Testing Model Transformations, Theory and Practice of Model Transformations, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2010, Volume 6142/2010, 77-92, {{doi|10.1007/978-3-642-13688-7_6}}, Camillo Fiorentini, Alberto Momigliano, Mario Ornaghi, Iman Poernomo, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n572730744340m56/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constant in logic ===
The "absurdity constant" is used in formal logic.&lt;ref&gt;''Classical harmony'', Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic, Volume 27, Number 4 (1986), 459-482, Alan Weir&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rule in logic ===
The absurdity rule is a rule in logic, as used by [[Patrick Suppes]] in ''Logic, methodology and philosophy of science: Proceedings''.&lt;ref&gt;''Logic, methodology and philosophy of science: Proceedings'', Patrick Suppes [https://books.google.com/books?id=QUgmsMm5LcAC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;dq=Absurdity+constant+Suppes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xkoEeQ8WGF&amp;sig=9S55s11JoR22Pov8IGBHV7qKhXA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Eh9kTa_ZDo-ssAPoksygCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theology ==
{{Quote|"I believe because it is absurd"|Tertullian}}
Absurdity is cited as a basis for some theological reasoning about formation of belief and faith, such as in [[fideism]], an [[epistemological]] theory that reason and faith may be hostile to each other. The statement ''"[[Credo quia absurdum]]"'' ("I believe because it is absurd") is attributed to [[Tertullian]] from ''[[De Carne Christi]]'', as translated by philosopher [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Philosophical Dictionary: From the French'', Voltaire&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[New Advent Church]], what Tertullian actually says in DCC 5 is "... the Son of God died; it is by all means to be believed, because it is absurd."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0315.htm On the Flesh of Christ, Fathers of the Church, New Advent]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century, the Spanish theologian [[Tostatus]] used what he thought was a reduction to absurdity arguing against a spherical earth using dogma, arguing that a spherical earth would imply the existence of [[antipodes]], which would be impossible since this would require either that Christ has appeared twice, or that the inhabitants of the antipodes would be forever damned, which he claimed was an absurdity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Absurdity can refer to any strict religious dogma that pushes something to the point of violating common sense. For example, inflexible religious dictates are sometimes termed [[pharisaism]], referring to unreasonable emphasis on observing exact words or rules, rather than the intent or spirit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/pharisaic "Pharisaic", Your Diciontionary.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718143857/http://www.yourdictionary.com/pharisaic |date=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It was Pharisaic in its ritualism and… asceticism… proclaiming a doctrine of absurdity to the enlightened pagan", ''The Churches of the New Testament'', George W. McDaniel, 1921&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/pharisaic Your Dictionary.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718143857/http://www.yourdictionary.com/pharisaic |date=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Willet]] grouped absurdities with "flat contradictions to scripture" and "heresies".&lt;ref&gt;The doctrines and practices of the Church of Rome truly represented, John Gother, 1593&lt;/ref&gt;

== Action as a literary mode ==
"Action is the [[Mode (literature)|mode]] [that] [[fiction]] writers use to show what is happening at any given moment in the story," states [[Evan Marshall (agent)|Evan Marshall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation | Marshall | 1998 | p = 142}}&lt;/ref&gt; who identifies five fiction-writing modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation | Marshall | 1998 | pp = 143–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jessica Page Morrell]] lists six delivery modes for fiction-writing: action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation | Morrell | 2006 | p = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Selgin]] refers to ''methods'', including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, and description.

While [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]] is the element that brings a story and its characters to life on the page, and [[Narration|narrative]] gives the story its depth and substance, action creates the movement within a story. Writing a story means weaving all of the elements of fiction together.  When it is done right, weaving dialogue, narrative, and action can create a beautiful tapestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A scene top-heavy with action can feel unreal because it is likely that characters doing something—anything at all—would be talking during the activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4200">In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]], a [[tensor]] is '''antisymmetric on''' (or '''with respect to''') '''an index subset''' if it alternates [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]] (+/−) when any two indices of the subset are interchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=K.F.

For example,
:&lt;math&gt;T_{ijk\dots} = -T_{jik\dots} = T_{jki\dots} = -T_{kji\dots} = T_{kij\dots} = -T_{ikj\dots}&lt;/math&gt;
holds when the tensor is antisymmetric with respect to its first three indices.

If a tensor changes sign under exchange of ''each'' pair of its indices, then the tensor is '''completely''' (or '''totally''') '''antisymmetric'''.  A completely antisymmetric covariant tensor of [[tensor order|order]] ''p'' may be referred to as a [[differential form|''p''-form]], and a completely antisymmetric contravariant tensor may be referred to as a [[multivector|''p''-vector]].

==Antisymmetric and symmetric tensors==
A tensor '''A''' that is antisymmetric on indices ''i'' and ''j'' has the property that the [[Tensor contraction|contraction]] with a tensor '''B''' that is symmetric on indices ''i'' and ''j'' is identically 0.

For a general tensor '''U''' with components &lt;math&gt;U_{ijk\dots}&lt;/math&gt; and a pair of indices ''i'' and ''j'', '''U''' has symmetric and antisymmetric parts defined as:

:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;U_{(ij)k\dots}=\frac{1}{2}(U_{ijk\dots}+U_{jik\dots})&lt;/math&gt; ||&amp;nbsp;|| (symmetric part)
|-
| &lt;math&gt;U_{[ij]k\dots}=\frac{1}{2}(U_{ijk\dots}-U_{jik\dots})&lt;/math&gt; ||&amp;nbsp;||(antisymmetric part).
|}
 
Similar definitions can be given for other pairs of indices.  As the term "part" suggests, a tensor is the sum of its symmetric part and antisymmetric part for a given pair of indices, as in

:&lt;math&gt;U_{ijk\dots}=U_{(ij)k\dots}+U_{[ij]k\dots}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Notation==
A shorthand notation for anti-symmetrization is denoted by a pair of square brackets. For example, in arbitrary dimensions, for an order 2 covariant tensor '''M''',
:&lt;math&gt;M_{[ab]} = \frac{1}{2!}(M_{ab} - M_{ba}) ,&lt;/math&gt;

and for an order 3 covariant tensor '''T''',
:&lt;math&gt;T_{[abc]} = \frac{1}{3!}(T_{abc}-T_{acb}+T_{bca}-T_{bac}+T_{cab}-T_{cba}) .&lt;/math&gt;

In any number of dimensions, these are equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;M_{[ab]} = \frac{1}{2!} \, \delta_{ab}^{cd} M_{cd} ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T_{[abc]} = \frac{1}{3!} \, \delta_{abc}^{def} T_{def} .&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, irrespective of the number of dimensions, antisymmetrization over ''p'' indices may be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;S_{[a_1 \dots a_p]} = \frac{1}{p!} \delta_{a_1 \dots a_p}^{b_1 \dots b_p} S_{b_1 \dots b_p} .&lt;/math&gt;

In the above,
:&lt;math&gt;\delta_{ab\dots}^{cd\dots}&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[generalized Kronecker delta]] of the appropriate order.

==Examples==

Totally antisymmetric tensors include:

* Trivially, all scalars and vectors (tensors of order 0 and 1) are totally antisymmetric (as well as being totally symmetric)
* The [[electromagnetic tensor]], &lt;math&gt;F_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; in [[electromagnetism]]
* The [[Riemannian volume form]] on a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12087">The '''April 27 demonstrations''' were massive student marches throughout major cities in [[China]] during the [[Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989]]. The students were protesting in response to the [[April 26 Editorial]] published by the ''[[People's Daily]]'' the previous day. The editorial asserted that the student movement was anti-party and contributed to a sense of chaos and destabilization.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Liang, ''The Tiananmen Papers''. eds Perry Link and Andrew J. Nathan. New York: Public Affairs, 2001. p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The content of the editorial incited the largest student protest of the movement thus far in Beijing: 50,000–200,000 students marched through the streets of Beijing before finally breaking through police lines into [[Tiananmen Square]].

==Events==
After the editorial was published, the students at [[Peking University]] in Beijing met during the night to discuss their plans for a march on April 27.&lt;ref&gt;Josephine T. Khu, "Student Organization in the Movement," ''Chinese Democracy and the Crisis of 1989: Chinese and American Reflections''. eds. Roger V. Des Forges, Luo Ning, Wu Yen-bo.Albany: State University of New York. p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig Calhoun, ''Neither Gods nor Emperors: Students and the Struggle for Democracy in China''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the authorities in the school tried to coax the students into calling it off; they gave hints that if the students did not protest, then the school officials would use their government connections to begin dialogues.&lt;ref&gt;Li Lu, ''Moving the Mountain: My Life in China From the Cultural Revolution to Tiananmen Square''. London: Macmillan, 1990. p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; But the students were too upset to stand down, and their enthusiasm to march could not be quelled. They compromised: they would only march part of the way, up to the [[3rd Ring Road (Beijing)|Third Ring Road]], but not all the way to Tiananmen Square itself. One scholar observed that the students thought it would show that they "rejected the April 26 editorial but would not constitute a major provocation," because the students were still scared of the government using retaliatory force.&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

===Locations===
Although students had demonstrated before, the April 27 demonstrations were particularly significant, in part because their scale was the largest instance of defying the state since 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Schock, ''Unarmed Insurrections: People Power Movements in Nondemocracies''. Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, 2005. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; Students were protesting across China: "not only in cities where demonstrations had already taken place, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Changchun, Xi'an, Wuhan, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Hefei, Changsha, Chengdu, and Chongqing, but also in cities where demonstrations now broke out for the first time: Shenyang, Dalian, Shijiazhuang, Nanning, Kunming, Shenzhen, Yinchuan, and Guilin." &lt;ref&gt;Zhang p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Beijing demonstration===
The Beijing demonstration was the largest, with one conservative estimate at 30,000 students marching, but most sources claim between 150,000-200,000 were present.&lt;ref&gt;Li p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to ascertain the exact number of student protesters, however, because there were so many citizens from Beijing cheering them on and supporting them in solidarity.  This is another reason why this demonstration was significant. In the words of economist Chu-yuan Cheng, it was the first time that a "pro-democracy student protest campaign drew enthusiastic support from the masses."&lt;ref&gt;Chu-yuan Cheng. ''Behind the Tiananmen Massacre: Social, Political, and Economic Ferment in China''. Boulder: Westview Press, 1990.  p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; According to two Canadian journalists, the April 26 editorial had also "struck a raw nerve within the general populace" and the focus on themes like corruption and inflation stirred the people's sympathy.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Simmmie and Bob Nixon, ''Tiananmen Square''. Vancouver: Douglas &amp; MacIntyre, 1989. p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Many of students were carrying signs or banners, not advocating for overthrowing the CPC, which the April 26 editorial had accused them of, but rather focused on democracy and cracking down on corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Fang Deng, ''Unintended Outcomes of Social Movements: The 1989 Chinese Student movement''. London: Routledge, 2011. p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Chai Ling]], a student protester who would later become a leader of the Hunger Strike Group, the [[Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation]] had planned to stage a demonstration in the Square on April 27 even "before the government verdict appeared in the ''People's Daily''."&lt;ref&gt;Chai Ling, ''A Heart for Freedom: The Remarkable Journey of a Young Dissident, Her Daring Escape, and Her Quest to Free China's Daughters''. Tyndale House Publishers, 2011. p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interaction between students and the state===
Many officials were worried about the size and support of the demonstrations: [[Yang Shangkun]], with [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s permission, had five hundred troops of [[38th Army (People's Republic of China)|Beijing Military Region's Thirty-Eighth Army]] enter Beijing in case the demonstrations got out of hand.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; This was in addition to all the available Beijing police, which included students from the police academy.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou Dingxin, ''The Power of Tiananmen: State-Society Relations and the 1989 Beijing Student Movement''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001. p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; But thousands of workers surrounded the soldiers and cut them off from the students; some of the workers even cleared aside police barricades to let the students march onward. The students, marching for fourteen hours, gained more support as they went on, and Canadian journalist Scott Simmie estimated that half a million citizens participated in the demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;Simmie, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the presence of police and military, there was little-to-no violence or altercations between them and the students.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Both sides were self-disciplined, and according to a few observing citizens, some of the students even shook officers' hands and chanted "the people's police love the people." &lt;ref&gt;Li p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;  The police did not resort to violence either; they temporarily slowed down the marchers before ultimately stepping aside and letting them pass.&lt;ref&gt;Fang, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  There was also little-to-no vandalism or trouble from the students in general: one Chinese bystander remarked that "even the vagabonds and thieves were on their good behaviour this time. No one wanted to stir up trouble."&lt;ref&gt;Li p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; This only served to buoy the students' feelings of elation, and instead of abandoning the march at the Third Ring Road, as planned, their enthusiasm compelled them to continue all the way to [[Tiananmen Square]].&lt;ref&gt;Li p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
From the students' perspective, the April 27 demonstrations were a milestone in the student movement: they realized that they had the potential to make a difference.&lt;ref&gt;Khu p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, the students were speaking for the people and workers; they did not focus solely on the interests of students and intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  In one scholar's interpretation, the people were unable to protest and demonstrate, so the student demonstrations took on the "silent frustrations of the population."&lt;ref&gt;Frank Niming, "Learning How To Protest," ''The Chinese People's Movement: Perspectives on Spring 1989''. ed. Tony Saich. New York: M.E. Sharpe, Inc, 1990. P.90&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the first case of when the students faced official resistance, such as police lines and a military presence, whom they interacted with peacefully.  The government became more placatory and held dialogues with the students afterwards, which encouraged them to continue protesting.&lt;ref&gt;Schock, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; It served to revitalize the movement and inspired the students by showing that their actions had serious consequences. One [[big-character poster]] was put up on the next day at [[People's University]], explaining the attitude of the students in the aftermath: "those of us who went through the experience agree: the march was a great victory in the process of democratization in China."&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; This was the immediate sensation of many of the students involved, but their elation was short-lived. The talks with the government would not go well, and the threat of violence would loom over the dialogues. Some observers even claim that these protests were not free from violence. A foreign medical student saw that "three or four students were brought into intensive care that evening, badly beaten, one allegedly with a broken back." &lt;ref&gt;Timothy Brook, ''Quelling The People: The Military Suppression of the Beijing Democracy Movement''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1992. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;  After news of this, another student said that "'blood will be shed…'where this would happen, or how soon it might come, he could not say, but he felt that it was coming."&lt;ref&gt;Brook, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; While violence may not have been inevitable, the events after the April 27 demonstrations did not reflect the students' triumphant attitude at the time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1786">'''Audience superior position''' is a term in [[literary theory]] to describe when the audience of a narrative work knows more than one or more characters in the narrative work.&lt;ref name="Write to TV"&gt;{{cite book| last = Cook| first = Martie| title = Write to TV: Out of Your Head and Onto the Screen| publisher = Focal Press| year = 2007| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9_x98ufdB-4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example in film might be when the audience knows the killer is hiding in the closet while the [[protagonist]] does not.

Another example of audience superior position is the use of [[Irony#Dramatic irony|dramatic irony]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordplayer.com/columns/wp48.Dramatic.Irony.html WordPlayer.com]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the audience may know [[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus]] is headed for a tragic ending before Oedipus himself does.

Audience superior may also be used for [[foreshadowing]] or dramatic tension. The audience is aware there is a shark in the film [[Jaws (film)|Jaws]] long before the protagonists accept this fact.

==Audience inferior position==

'''Audience inferior position''' is when the audience knows less than one or more of the characters in a narrative work. A key example is in murder mysteries, when the detective solves the crime before the audience. If the audience were to solve the crime before the detective, the audience would lose all interest in following the story.

==Audience equal position==

Much of the time in narrative works, the audience knows exactly as much as the characters they are following, and are not given more or less information by the author.

[[File:Authentic Thaumaturgy.jpg|thumb|upright|right]]
'''Authentic Thaumaturgy''' is a set of rules for portraying [[magic (gaming)|magic]] in [[role-playing game]]s, written by [[Isaac Bonewits]], based on the [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] system Bonewits claimed to use in real life in his capacity as the [[Archdruid]] of [[Ár nDraíocht Féin]]. The first edition was published by [[Chaosium]] in 1978, and a substantially expanded edition was published by [[Steve Jackson Games]] in 1998 which got a second edition in 2005.

Bonewits presents 26 Laws of Magic which he explains "are not legislative laws but, like those of physics or of musical harmony, are practical observations that have been accumulating over the course of thousands of years, with remarkable similarity in almost every known human culture. Those of you who prefer to remain skeptical as to the reality of psychic phenomena and the systems of magic developed to control them will at least find these Laws an interesting and detailed guide to what psychologists and anthropologists so patronizingly refer to as “magical thinking.”"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Bonewits then presents examples of how some of these laws work.

These 26 laws are (in order): The Law of Knowledge, Self-Knowledge, Cause &amp; Effect, Synchronicity, Association, Similarity, Contagion, Positive Attraction, Negative Attraction, Names, Words of Power, Personification, Invocation, Evocation, Identification, Infinite Data, Finite Senses, Personal Universes, Infinite Universes, Pragmatism, True Falsehoods, Synthesis, Polarity, Dynamic Balance, Perversity, and Unity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''Authentic Thaumaturgy''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11913">{{about|authority as a concept of political philosophy||}}

'''Authority''' is the [[Legitimacy (political)|right]] to exercise [[Power (social and political)|power]], which can be formalized by a [[State (polity)|state]] and exercised by way of judges, appointed executives of government, or the ecclesiastical or priestly appointed representatives of a God or other [[deity|deities]]. 

A governing body may be labelled an authority e.g. the [[Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority]] or the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]]. ''Authority'' can also mean the right to complete an action or execute an order.

In [[government]], ''authority'' is often used interchangeably with ''power''. However, their meanings differ: while ''power'' is the ability to order or accomplish a goal or to influence others, ''authority'' refers to a claim of [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]], the justification and right to exercise that power. For example, while a [[Crowd|mob]] may have the power to punish a criminal by beating or [[lynching]], the [[rule of law]] indicates that only a [[court]] of law has the authority to determine and refer a criminal for punishment. In this sense, authority is a matter of not only the ability or power to [[Decision-making|make decisions]], but the right to make these decisions and execute them with commensurate power. Appropriate authority is the basis of good government in the [[Republicanism|republican]] conception of government, which finds much of its theoretical origins in [[ancient Rome]].

== History ==
[[Ancient history|Ancient]] understandings of authority trace back to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and draw later from Catholic ([[Thomism|Thomistic]]) thought and other [[Tradition|traditional]] understandings. In more modern terms, forms of authority include transitional authority exhibited in for example [[Cambodia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC)|last=Widyono|first=Benny|date=Oct 2014|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; public authority in the form of [[Popular Power|popular power]], and, in more administrative terms, bureaucratic or managerial techniques. In terms of bureaucratic governance, one limitation of the governmental agents of the executive branch, as outlined by George A. Krause, is that they are not as close to the popular will as elected representatives are.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Legislative Delegation of Authority to Bureaucratic Agencies|last=Krause|first=George A.|date=2010|work=The Oxford Handbook of American Bureaucracy|access-date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor-last=Durant|editor-first=Robert F.|location=New York, NY|page=524}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claims of authority can extend to national or individual [[sovereignty]], which is broadly or provisionally understood as a claim to political authority that is [[Legitimation|legitimated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Sovereignty|last=Glanville|first=Luke|date=|work=The Oxford Handbook of the Responsibility to Protect|access-date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|editor-last=Bellamy|editor-first=Alex J.|location=New York, NY|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historical applications of authority in political terms include the formation of the city-state of [[Geneva]], and experimental treatises involving the topic of authority in relation to education include ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]]'' by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. As David Laitin defines, authority is a key concept to be defined in determining the range and role of political theory, science and inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laitin|first=David|date=1998|title=Toward a Political Science Discipline: Authority Patterns Revisited|url=|journal=Comparative Political Studies|volume=31|issue=4|pages=423-443|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relevance of a grounded understanding of authority includes the basic foundation and formation of political, civil and/or ecclesiastical institutions or representatives. In recent years, however, authority in political contexts has been challenged or questioned.

== Political philosophy ==
There have been several contributions to the debate of [[political authority]]. Among others, [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Alexandre Kojève]] and [[Carl Schmitt]] have provided some of the most remarkable texts.

In [[political philosophy]], the jurisdiction of political authority, the location of [[sovereignty]], the balancing of freedom and authority,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hegel on Freedom and Authority|last=Cristi|first=Renato|publisher=University of Wales Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Cardiff, Wales|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the requirements of political obligations have been core questions from the time of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] to the present. Most [[democracy|democratic]] societies are engaged in an ongoing discussion regarding the legitimate extent of the exercise of [[government]]al authority. In the [[United States]], for instance, there is a prevailing belief that the political system as instituted by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] should accord the populace as much freedom as reasonable, and that government should limit its authority accordingly, known as [[limited government]].

In the discussion regarding the legitimacy of political authority, there are two beliefs at the respective ends of the spectrum. The first is the belief in the absolute freedom of the individual, otherwise known as [[Philosophical anarchism|political anarchism]]. The second is the belief that there must be a central authority in the form of a sovereign that claims ownership and control over the masses. This belief is known as [[statism]]. Sovereignty, in modern terms, can refer either to the adherence to a form of sovereign rule or the individual sovereignty, or autonomy, of a nation-state. The argument for political anarchy and anti-statism is made by [[Michael Huemer]] in his book ''[[The Problem of Political Authority]]''. On the other side, one of the main arguments for the legitimacy of the state is some form of the “[[Social contract|social contract theory]]” developed by [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his 1668 book, [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan'']], or by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his political writings on [[The Social Contract|the social contract]]. 

== Sociology ==
Since the emergence of the [[social sciences]], authority has become a subject of research in a variety of [[empirical]] settings: the family (parental authority), small groups (informal authority of [[leadership]]), intermediate organizations such as schools, churches, armies, industries and bureaucracies (organizational and bureaucratic authorities), and society-wide or inclusive organizations, ranging from the most primitive tribal society to the modern nation-state and intermediate organization (political authority).

The definition of authority in contemporary social science remains a matter of debate. [[Max Weber]] in his essay "[[Politics as a Vocation]]" (1919) divided legitimate authority into [[Authority (sociology)|three types]]. Others, like [[Howard Bloom]], suggest a parallel between authority and [[Veneration of the dead|respect/reverence for ancestors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== The United States ==
The understanding of political authority and the exercise of [[Political power in the United States over time|political powers]] in the American context traces back to the writings of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], including the arguments put forward in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' by [[James Madison]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and the First Chief Justice of the United States [[John Jay]], and later speeches by the 16th President of the United States [[Abraham Lincoln]]. "Our government rests in public opinion," President Abraham Lincoln said in 1856 Related to the Authority of the Sanatana Kingdom .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lincoln Speeches|last=Guelzo|first=Allen C.|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1854 Speech at Peoria, Illinois, Lincoln espoused "the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases with all which is exclusively his own," a principle existing "at the foundation of the sense of justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lincoln Speeches|last=Guelzo|first=Allen C.|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of personal ownership and stewardship was integral to the practice of [[Limited government|self-government]] as Abraham Lincoln saw it by a [[Republicanism|Republican]] nation and its people. This was because, as Abraham Lincoln also declared, "No man is good enough to govern another man, without that other's consent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lincoln Speeches|last=Guelzo|first=Allen C.|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AutoTrack''' is a vehicle [[swept path analysis]] software program used for analysing the movements of steered and wheeled vehicles including [[Automobile|cars]], [[truck]]s, [[trams]], [[aircraft]] and other more specialist vehicles such as [[fork lift]] trucks, [[wheelchairs]] and access platforms. AutoTrack was the world's first [[swept path analysis]] software program, originally being jointly developed by TRL&lt;ref&gt;The [[Transport Research Laboratory]] [http://www.trl.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; (the UK's [[Transport Research Laboratory]]) and British engineering consultants, Travers Morgan (acquired by Symonds in 1995 who are now part of Capita Symonds,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitasymonds.co.uk/about_us/an_overview/our_history.aspx Capita Symonds company history]&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of TRACK. The term track refers to the tracking of a vehicle's simulated movements in relation to geometry, based upon vehicle dimensions, [[chassis]] and [[steering]] specification. AutoTrack has many similarities and performs the same function as the alternative swept path analysis program [[AutoTURN]], which is developed by Transoft Solutions, Inc..

AutoTrack is generally used by transportation engineers, architects and planners for the analysis and design of [[highways]], [[intersection (road)|intersection]]s, [[buildings]] and other facilities to check that provision has been made for the space and [[geometry]] required to manoeuvre specified design [[vehicles]]. A design vehicle may be a real vehicle modelled within the software's computer environment but will often be a virtual vehicle that does not exist in real life, rather being indicative of the type and configuration of vehicle that the final design is expected to accommodate. Design vehicles are commonly specified by the relevant governing body that also controls the specification for which the design must conform.

The AutoTrack range is divided into modules that service the [[Road]], [[Rail transport|Rail]] and [[Airports]] industries and operates within several different [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] systems such as [[AutoCAD]] by [[Autodesk]],&lt;ref&gt;[[AutoCAD]] product page on the [[Autodesk]] website [http://usa.autodesk.com/autocad/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microstation]] by [[Bentley Systems]],&lt;ref&gt;A brief history of [[Bentley Systems]] and [[Microstation]] [http://communities.bentley.com/products/microstation/w/microstation__wiki/history-of-microstation.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bricscad]] by Bricsys&lt;ref&gt;Bricsys company website (developer of [[Bricscad]] [http://www.bricsys.com]&lt;/ref&gt; (a former member of the [[IntelliCAD Technology Consortium]]) and standalone in [[Microsoft Windows]]. When the software was first developed it initially ran as a [[DOS]]-based application and when it was ported to operate within [[AutoCAD]], it was given the name AutoTrack. The software, initially developed for consulting purposes, was sold commercially and following the demise of the original company, a management buy out pre-empted the incorporation of Savoy Computing Services Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savoycomputing.com Savoy Computing company website]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110041309/http://www.savoycomputing.com/ |date=January 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1996. Two of the surviving directors of Savoy Computing were involved with the original development of TRACK.

In August, 2013 [[Autodesk]] acquired the technology assets of Savoy Computing Services Ltd, including the AutoTrack technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.autodesk.com/press-release/corporate-sustainability/autodesk-expands-infrastructure-design-and-analysis-portfolio Autodesk expands Infrastructure portfolio]&lt;/ref&gt; Autodesk subsequently released Autodesk Vehicle Tracking, which directly superseded AutoTrack in November, 2013. At this point Savoy Computing Services ceased trading and the AutoTrack software product is since no longer supported.

== Brief history of AutoTrack ==
* 1988 - AutoTrack introduced "lock to lock" time as a critical factor used in the calculation of manoeuvrability of steered vehicles
* 1991 - AutoTrack archived all design data within the "parent" [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] drawing
* 1992 - AutoTrack introduced modelling of [[tram]] and [[light rail]] vehicle movements
* 1997 - First swept path program to calculate effective [[axle]] positions from vehicle dimensions
* 1999 - AutoTrack introduced AutoDrive (a mouse point and click system that calculates possible movements from one vehicle position to the next)
* 1999 - Grip editing was introduced to enable the editing of vehicle paths instead of their deletion
* 2002 - Recording of scaled animations containing multiple vehicles was introduced, with a [[movie]] file being able to be recorded from within the program
* 2004 - A standalone version that operated in [[Microsoft Windows]] was introduced for engineers without [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] systems
* 2007 - AutoTrack became the first [[64-bit]] [[swept path analysis]] software program
* 2013 - AutoTrack acquired by [[Autodesk]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3296">The '''Basin Focal Projects''' (BFPs) are a set of ''[[CGIAR]] Challenge Program on Water and Food'' projects aimed at identifying and catalyzing the implementation of strategic interventions to enhance human and ecological well-being through increases in [[river basin]] and local level water productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.waterandfood.org/ |title=CGIAR Challenge Program on Water and Food website |access-date=2018-11-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627163014/https://waterandfood.org/ |archive-date=2018-06-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpwfbfp.pbworks.com Basin Focal Projects Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The Projects provide strategic research that links project and basin activities with the global demand for improved agricultural water productivity. They do this by analyzing conditions in ten river basins under six work packages.

*Phase I projects commissioned in 2005 include basins of the [[Mekong]], [[Karkheh]], [[Volta River|Volta]] and the [[Sao Francisco]].These four projects have reached completion. They produced valuable insights about the specific nature of the food and water crisis in basins.
*Phase II projects commissioned in 2008 include basins of [[Indus|Indo]]-[[Ganges]], [[Andes|Andean]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfpandes.org Andean Project Website]&lt;/ref&gt; system of basins, [[Nile]], [[Niger]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfpniger.eu Niger Project Website]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326142147/http://www.bfpniger.eu/ |date=March 26, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yellow River]] and the [[Limpopo]] and run through 2009.

Research projects are led by the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]], Australia (CSIRO), [[University of California, Davis]] (UC-Davis), [[Institut de recherche pour le développement]] (IRD), [[International Water Management Institute]] (IWMI), Agricultural Research Council of South Africa (ARC) and are supported by FANRPAN,  [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI) and [[King's College London]] (KCL).

==Methodology==

BFP analyses are grouped into six work packages: 
*water poverty,
*water availability,
*water productivity,
*institutional analysis,
*intervention analysis and
*knowledge management.

Problems of water, food and poverty are explored by asking the following kinds of questions:

*To what extent is water scarce?
*To what extent is [[water scarcity]] and access a cause of poverty?
*Who gets access to water and who does not?
*How are such decisions made?
*How efficiently is water used?
*How can it be used more efficiently?
*How can water related interventions (policy changes, institutional innovations, new technologies) help improve food security, livelihood resilience and ecosystem services?
*What are the consequences (for different water users and uses at different scales) of introducing different kinds of changes?

== Types ==

=== Starch-based plastics ===
[[Thermoplastic]] starch currently represents the most widely used bioplastic, constituting about 50 percent of the bioplastics market{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}. Simple starch bioplastic can be made at home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Potato-Plastic!/ Make Potato Plastic!]. Instructables.com (2007-07-26). Retrieved on 2011-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pure starch is able to absorb [[humidity]], and is thus a suitable material for the production of drug capsules by the pharmaceutical sector. Flexibiliser and [[plasticiser]] such as [[sorbitol]] and [[glycerine]] can also be added so the starch can also be processed thermo-plastically. The characteristics of the resulting bioplastic (also called "thermo-plastical starch") can be tailored to specific needs by adjusting the amounts of these additives.

Starch-based bioplastics are often blended with biodegradable polyesters to produce starch/polylactic acid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khalid|first1=Saud|last2=Yu|first2=Long|last3=Meng|first3=Linghan|last4=Liu|first4=Hongsheng|last5=Ali|first5=Amjad|last6=Chen|first6=Ling|title=Poly(lactic acid)/starch composites: Effect of microstructure and morphology of starch granules on performance|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/app.45504/abstract|website=Journal of Applied Polymer Science|accessdate=25 July 2017|pages=n/a–n/a|language=en|doi=10.1002/app.45504|volume=134|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; starch/[[polycaprolactone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bioplasticsonline.net/2010/06/starch-based-bioplastic-manufacturers-and-suppliers/ | title=Starch based Bioplastic Manufacturers and Suppliers | work=bioplasticsonline.net | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814061041/http://bioplasticsonline.net/2010/06/starch-based-bioplastic-manufacturers-and-suppliers/ | archivedate=August 14, 2011 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; or starch/Ecoflex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | archive-date=2012-07-13 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713125533/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-8106328/Enhancing-biopolymers-additives-are-needed.html | url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-8106328/Enhancing-biopolymers-additives-are-needed.html | title=Enhancing biopolymers: additives are needed for toughness, heat resistance &amp; processability.(biopolymers)(Cover story) | work=goliath.ecnext.com | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; (polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate produced by BASF&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BASF announces major bioplastics production expansion|url=http://bioplastic-innovation.com/2008/04/22/basf-announces-major-bioplastics-production-expansion/}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  blends. These blends are used for industrial applications and are also compostable. Other producers, such as Roquette, have
developed other starch/[[polyolefin]] blends. These blends are not biodegradable, but have a lower carbon footprint than petroleum-based plastics used for the same applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roquette, nouvel acteur sur le marché des plastiques, lance GAÏALENE® : une gamme innovante de plastique végétal|url=http://bioplastic-innovation.com/2010/10/16/roquette-nouvel-acteur-sur-le-marche-des-plastiques-lance-gaialene%C2%AE-une-gamme-innovante-de-plastique-vegetal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the origin of its raw material, starch is cheap, abundant, and renewable.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Citation|last=Avérous|first=Luc|title=Nanobiocomposites Based on Plasticized Starch|date=2014|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-444-53730-0.00028-2|work=Starch Polymers|pages=211–239|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780444537300|access-date=2018-09-26|last2=Pollet|first2=Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starch based plastics are complex blends of starch with compostable plastics such as Polylactic acid, Polybutylene Adipate Terephthalate, Polybutylene Succinate, Polycaprolactone, and Polyhydroxyalkanoates. These complex blends improve water resistance as well as processing and mechanical properties.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;

Starch-based films (mostly used for packaging purposes) are made mainly from starch blended with thermoplastic polyesters to form biodegradable and compostable products. These films are seen specifically in consumer goods packaging of magazine wrappings and bubble films. In food packaging, these films are seen as bakery or fruit and vegetable bags. Composting bags with this films are used in selective collecting of organic waste.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Further, a new starch-based film was developed by Agricultural Research Service scientists can even be used as a paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.repl.2016.09.002 | title=Collaboration delivers better results | date=January 2017 | last=Cate | first=Peter | journal=Reinforced Plastics | volume=61 | issue=1 | pages=51–54 | issn=0034-3617 | doi=10.1016/j.repl.2016.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cellulose-based plastics ===
[[File:Bio-K Blister CG.jpg|thumb|A packaging blister made from [[cellulose acetate]], a bioplastic]]

[[Cellulose]] bioplastics are mainly the [[cellulose ester]]s, (including [[cellulose acetate]] and [[nitrocellulose]]) and their derivatives, including [[celluloid]].

Cellulose can become thermoplastic when extensively modified. An example of this is cellulose acetate, which is expensive and therefore rarely used for packaging. However, cellulosic fibers added to starches can improve mechanical properties, permeability to gas, and water resistance due to being less hydrophilic than starch.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A group at Shanghai University was able to construct a novel green plastic based on cellulose through a method called hot pressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=Na|last2=Hou|first2=Xingshuang|last3=Chen|first3=Li|last4=Cui|first4=Siqi|last5=Shi|first5=Liyi|last6=Ding|first6=Peng|date=2017-05-16|title=A Green Plastic Constructed from Cellulose and Functionalized Graphene with High Thermal Conductivity|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b02675|journal=ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces|volume=9|issue=21|pages=17914–17922|doi=10.1021/acsami.7b02675|issn=1944-8244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protein-based plastics ===
Bioplastics can be made from proteins from different sources. For example, wheat gluten and casein show promising properties as a raw material for different biodegradable polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=J. H.|last2=Murphy|first2=R. J.|last3=Narayan|first3=R.|last4=Davies|first4=G. B. H.|date=2009-07-27|title=Biodegradable and compostable alternatives to conventional plastics|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/364/1526/2127|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=364|issue=1526|pages=2127–2139|doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0289|issn=0962-8436|pmc=2873018|pmid=19528060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, soy protein is being considered as another source of bioplastic. Soy proteins have been used in plastic production for over one hundred years. For example, body panels of an original Ford automobile were made of soy-based plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/j.1941-9635.2008.tb00292.x | title=The History of Tomorrow's Materials: Protein-Based Biopolymers | date=February 2008 | last=Ralston | first=Brian E. | last2=Osswald | first2=Tim A. | journal=Plastics Engineering | volume=64 | issue=2 | pages=36–40 | issn=0091-9578 | doi=10.1002/j.1941-9635.2008.tb00292.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are difficulties with using soy protein-based plastics due to their water sensitivity and relatively high cost. Therefore, producing blends of soy protein with some already-available biodegradable polyesters improves the water sensitivity and cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bm050888p | title=Morphology and Properties of Soy Protein and Polylactide Blends | date=May 2006 | last=Zhang | first=Jinwen | last2=Jiang | first2=Long | last3=Zhu | first3=Linyong | last4=Jane | first4=Jay-lin | last5=Mungara | first5=Perminus | journal=Biomacromolecules | volume=7 | issue=5 | pages=1551–1561 | issn=1525-7797 | doi=10.1021/bm050888p}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Some aliphatic polyesters ===
The aliphatic bio[[polyester]]s are mainly [[polyhydroxyalkanoate]]s (PHAs) like the [[poly-3-hydroxybutyrate]] (PHB), polyhydroxyvalerate (PHV) and polyhydroxyhexanoate (PHH).

==== Polylactic acid (PLA) ====
[[File:Mulch Film made of PLA-Blend Bio-Flex.jpg|thumb|left|Mulch film made of [[polylactic acid]] (PLA)-blend bio-flex]]

[[Polylactic acid]] (PLA) is a [[transparent plastic]] produced from [[corn]]&lt;ref name="smithsonianmag.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/plastic.html|title=History, Travel, Arts, Science, People, Places - Smithsonian|work=smithsonianmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[dextrose]]. Superficially, it is similar to conventional petrochemical-based mass plastics like [[Polystyrene|PS]].  It has the distinct advantage of degrading to nontoxic products.   Unfortunately it exhibits inferior impact strength, thermal robustness, and barrier properties (blocking air transport across the membrane).&lt;ref name=Ullmanns/&gt;  PLA and PLA blends generally come in the form of granulates with various properties, and are used in the plastic processing industry for the production of films, fibers, plastic containers, cups and bottles.
PLA is also the most common type of plastic [[Fiber|filament]] used for home [[fused deposition modeling]].

==== Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate ====
The [[biopolymer]] poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a [[polyester]] produced by certain bacteria processing glucose, corn starch&lt;ref name="bioplastic-innovation.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mirel: PHAs grades for Rigid Sheet and Thermoforming|url=http://bioplastic-innovation.com/2011/06/08/mirel-phas-grades-for-rigid-sheet-and-thermoforming/}}&lt;/ref&gt; or wastewater.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Micromidas is using carefully constructed populations of bacteria to convert organic waste into bio-degradable plastics. |url=http://bioplastic-innovation.com/2011/07/29/micromidas-is-using-carefully-constructed-populations-of-bacteria-to-convert-organic-waste-into-bio-degradable-plastics/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023230713/http://bioplastic-innovation.com/2011/07/29/micromidas-is-using-carefully-constructed-populations-of-bacteria-to-convert-organic-waste-into-bio-degradable-plastics/ |archivedate=October 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its characteristics are similar to those of the petroplastic [[polypropylene]]. PHB production is increasing. The [[South America]]n [[sugar]] industry, for example, has decided to expand PHB production to an industrial scale. PHB is distinguished primarily by its physical characteristics. It can be processed into a transparent film with a melting point higher than 130 degrees Celsius, and is biodegradable without residue.

=== Polyhydroxyalkanoates  ===
[[Polyhydroxyalkanoates]] are linear [[polyester]]s produced in nature by [[bacteria]]l [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of [[sugar]] or [[lipid]]s. They are produced by the bacteria to store carbon and energy. In industrial production, the polyester is extracted and purified from the bacteria by optimizing the conditions for the fermentation of sugar. More than 150 different [[monomer]]s can be combined within this family to give materials with extremely different properties. PHA is more ductile and less elastic than other plastics, and it is also biodegradable. These plastics are being widely used in the medical industry.

=== Polyamide 11 ===
[[Polyamide 11|PA 11]] is a [[biopolymer]] derived from natural oil. It is also known under the tradename Rilsan B, commercialized by [[Arkema]]. PA 11 belongs to the technical polymers family and is not biodegradable. Its properties are similar to those of [[Polyamide 12|PA 12]], although emissions of greenhouse gases and consumption of nonrenewable resources are reduced during its production. Its thermal resistance is also superior to that of PA 12. It is used in high-performance applications like automotive fuel lines, pneumatic airbrake tubing, electrical cable antitermite sheathing, flexible oil and gas pipes, control fluid umbilicals, sports shoes, electronic device components, and catheters.

A similar plastic is Polyamide 410 (PA 410), derived 70% from castor oil, under the trade name EcoPaXX, commercialized by DSM.&lt;ref name="EcoPaXX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm.com/en_US/cworld/public/media/pages/press-releases/19_10_dsm_launches_bio_based_performance_materials_for_automotive_industry.jsp|title=Home|work=dsm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
PA 410 is a high-performance polyamide that combines the benefits of a high melting point (approx. 250&amp;nbsp;°C), low moisture absorption and excellent resistance to various chemical substances.

=== Bio-derived polyethylene ===
{{Main|Renewable Polyethylene}}

The basic building block ([[monomer]]) of [[polyethylene]] is ethylene. Ethylene is chemically similar to, and can be derived from ethanol, which can be produced by fermentation of agricultural feedstocks such as sugar cane or corn. Bio-derived polyethylene is chemically and physically identical to traditional polyethylene&amp;nbsp;– it does not biodegrade but can be recycled. The Brazilian chemicals group [[Braskem]] claims that using its method of producing polyethylene from sugar cane ethanol captures (removes from the environment) 2.15 tonnes of {{CO2}} per tonne of Green Polyethylene produced.

=== Genetically modified bioplastics ===
[[Genetic modification]] (GM) is also a challenge for the bioplastics industry. None of the currently available bioplastics&amp;nbsp;– which can be considered first generation products&amp;nbsp;– require the use of GM crops, although GM corn is the standard feedstock.

Looking further ahead, some of the second generation bioplastics manufacturing technologies under development employ the "plant factory" model, using [[genetically modified crops]] or [[genetically modified bacterium|genetically modified bacteria]] to optimise efficiency.

===Polyhydroxyurethanes ===

Recently, there have been a large emphasis on producing biobased and isocyanate-free polyurethanes. One such example utilizes a spontaneous reaction between polyamines and cyclic carbonates to produce polyhydroxurethanes.&lt;ref name="From Petrochemical Polyurethanes to Biobased Polyhydroxyurethanes"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Nohra  | first = Bassam  |author2=Laure Candy |author3=Jean-Francois Blanco |author4=Celine Guerin |author5=Yann Raoul |author6=Zephirin Mouloungui  | year = 2013 | title = From Petrochemical Polyurethanes to Biobased Polyhydroxyurethanes | journal = Macromolecules | volume =  46| issue =  | doi =10.1021/ma400197c | pages=3771–3792}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike traditional cross-linked polyurethanes, cross-linked polyhydroxyurethanes have been shown to be capable of recycling and reprocessing through dynamic transcarbamoylation reactions.&lt;ref name="Mechanically Activated, Catalyst-Free Polyhydroxyurethane Vitrimers"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Fortman  | first = David J.  |author2=Jacob P.

Materials such as starch, cellulose, wood, sugar and biomass are used as a substitute for fossil fuel resources to produce bioplastics; this makes the production of bioplastics a more sustainable activity compared to conventional plastic production.&lt;ref name= "Gironi and Piemonte"&gt;Gironi, F., and Vincenzo Piemonte. “Bioplastics and Petroleum-Based Plastics: Strengths and Weaknesses.” Energy Sources, Part A: Recovery, Utilization and Environmental Effects, vol. 33, no. 21, 2011, pp. 1949–59, doi:10.1080/15567030903436830.&lt;/ref&gt; The environmental impact of bioplastics is often debated, as there are many different metrics for "greenness" (e.g., water use, energy use, deforestation, biodegradation, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Yates, Madeleine R., and Claire Y.

&lt;/ref&gt; Although bioplastics save more nonrenewable energy than conventional plastics and emit less GHG compared to conventional plastics, bioplastics also have negative environmental impacts such as eutrophication and acidification.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; Bioplastics induce higher eutrophication potentials than conventional plastics.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; Biomass production during industrial farming practices causes nitrate and phosphate to filtrate into water bodies; this causes eutrophication which is the richness of the nutrients in body waters.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; Eutrophication is a threat to water resources around the world since it kills aquatic organisms, creates dead zones and causes harmful algal blooms.&lt;ref&gt;Sinha, E., et al. “Eutrophication Will Increase during the 21st Century as a Result of Precipitation Changes.” Science, vol. 357, no. July, 2017, pp. 405–08.&lt;/ref&gt; Bioplastics also increase acidification.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; The high increase in eutrophication and acidification caused by bioplastics is also caused by the using chemical fertilizer in the cultivation of renewable raw materials to produce bioplastics.&lt;ref name= "Gironi and Piemonte"/&gt;

Other environmental impacts of bioplastics include exerting lower human and terrestrial ecotoxicity and carcinogenic potentials compared to conventional plastics.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; However, bioplastics exert higher aquatic ecotoxicity than conventional materials.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; Bioplastics and other bio-based materials increase stratospheric ozone depletion compared to conventional plastics; this is a result of nitrous oxide emissions during fertilizer application during industrial farming for biomass production.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; Artificial fertilizer increase nitrous oxide emissions especially when the crop does not need all the nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;Rosas, Francisco, et al. “Nitrous Oxide Emission Reductions from Cutting Excessive Nitrogen Fertilizer Applications.” Climatic Change, vol. 132, no. 2, 2015, pp. 353–67, doi:10.1007/s10584-015-1426-y.&lt;/ref&gt; Minor environmental impacts of bioplastics include toxicity through using pesticides on the crops used to make bioplastics.&lt;ref name= "Gironi and Piemonte"/&gt; Bioplastics also cause carbon dioxide emissions from harvesting vehicles.&lt;ref name= "Gironi and Piemonte"/&gt; Other minor environmental impacts include high water consumption for biomass cultivation, soil erosion, soil carbon losses and loss of biodiversity, and they are mainly are a result of land use associated with bioplastics.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; Land use for bioplastics production leads to lost carbon sequestration and increases the carbon costs while diverting land from its existing uses &lt;ref&gt;Gironi, F., and Vincenzo Piemonte. “Land-Use Change Emissions: How Green Are the Bioplastics?” Environmental Progress &amp; Sustainable Energy, vol. 30, no. 4, 2010, pp. 685–691, doi:10.1002/ep.10518.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although bioplastics are extremely advantageous because they reduce non-renewable consumption and GHG emissions, they also negatively affect the environment through land and water consumption, using pesticide and fertilizer, eutrophication and acidification; hence one’s preference for either bioplastics or conventional plastics depends on what one considers the most important environmental impact.&lt;ref name= "Gironi and Piemonte"/&gt;

Biodegradation of any plastic is a process that happens at solid/liquid interface whereby the enzymes in the liquid phase depolymerize the solid phase &lt;ref&gt;Degli-Innocenti, Francesco. “Biodegradation of Plastics and Ecotoxicity Testing: When Should It Be Done.” Frontiers in Microbiology, vol. 5, no. SEP, 2014, pp. 1–3, doi:10.3389/fmicb.2014.00475.&lt;/ref&gt; Both bioplastics and conventional plastics containing additives are able to biodegrade.&lt;ref&gt;Gómez, Eddie F., and Frederick C.

[[File:Teebeutel Polylactid 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Tea bag]]s made of polylactide (PLA), (peppermint tea)]]While plastics based on organic materials were manufactured by chemical companies throughout the 20th century, the first company solely focused on bioplastics- Marlborough Biopolymers- was founded in 1983.

The expense and time requirements of researching and testing new bio-based and biodegradable polymers have placed bioplastics at a commercial disadvantage compared to petrochemical-based plastics. Bioplastics remain less than one percent of all plastics manufactured worldwide,&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/j.1941-9635.2016.tb01489.x | title=Ready to Grow: The Biodegradable Polymers Market | date=March 2016 | journal=Plastics Engineering | volume=72 | issue=3 | pages=1–4 | issn=0091-9578 | doi=10.1002/j.1941-9635.2016.tb01489.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and until very recently have been an average of 2-4 times more expensive to manufacture than petrochemical plastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Darby|first=Debra|date=August 2012|title=Bioplastics Industry Report|url=|journal=BioCycle|volume=53|issue=8|pages=40–44|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most bioplastics do not yet save more carbon emissions than are required to manufacture them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rujnić-Sokele|first=Maja|last2=Pilipović|first2=Ana|date=September 2017|title=Challenges and Opportunities of Biodegradable Plastics: A Mini Review|url=|journal=Waste Management and Research|volume=35|issue=2|pages=132–140|doi=10.1177/0734242x16683272|via=SAGE Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the cost of research, bioplastics lack the versatility of application that petrochemical plastics possess, with many conventional plastics having no bio-based equivalent that can match their quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pathak|first=Swathi|date=December 2014|title=Bioplastic: Its Timeline Based Scenario &amp; Challenges|url=|journal=Journal of Polymer and Biopolymer Physics Chemistry|publisher=SciEP|volume=2|issue=4|pages=84–90|doi=10.12691/jpbpc-2-4-5|via=SciePub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the industry faces logistical problems around both material sources and waste disposal infrastructure. As most bioplastics are produced from plant sugars, starches, or oils, it is estimated that replacing 250 million tons of the plastic manufactured each year with bio-based plastics would require 100 million hectares of land, or 7 percent of the arable land on Earth. And when bioplastics reach the end of their life cycle, those designed to be compostable and marketed as biodegradable are often sent to landfills due to the lack of proper composting facilities or waste sorting, where they then release methane as they break down anaerobically.&lt;ref&gt;Dolfen, Julia. “Bioplastics- Opportunities and Challenges.” US Composting Council. 2012 Compostable Plastics Symposium, Jan. 2012, Austin, Texas, https://compostingcouncil.org/admin/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Dolfen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Industrial compostability – EN 13432, ASTM D6400 ===
The [[European Norm|EN]] 13432 industrial standard is arguably the most international in scope. This standard must be met in order to claim that a plastic product is compostable in the European marketplace. In summary, it requires biodegradation of 90% of the materials in a lab within 90 days. The [[ASTM]] 6400 standard is the regulatory framework for the United States and sets a less stringent threshold of 60% biodegradation within 180 days for non-homopolymers, and 90% biodegradation of homopolymers within industrial composting conditions (temperatures at or above 140F). Municipal compost facilities do not see above 130F.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Many [[starch]]-based plastics, PLA-based plastics and certain [[aliphatic]]-[[aromatic]] co-[[polyester]] compounds, such as [[succinates]] and [[adipates]], have obtained these certificates. Additive-based bioplastics sold as photodegradable or [[Oxo Biodegradable]] do not comply with these standards in their current form.

=== Compostability – ASTM D6002 ===
The ASTM D 6002 method for determining the compostability of a plastic defined the word ''[[compost]]able'' as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;that which is capable of undergoing biological decomposition in a compost site such that the material is not visually distinguishable and breaks down into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds and biomass at a rate consistent with known compostable materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compostable.info/compostable.htm|title=Compostable.info|work=compostable.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{Original research|section|date=September 2015}}
This definition drew much criticism because, contrary to the way the word is traditionally defined, it completely divorces the process of "composting" from the necessity of it leading to [[humus]]/compost as the end product. The only criterion this standard ''does'' describe is that a compostable plastic must '''look''' to be going away as fast as something else one has already established to be compostable under the ''traditional'' definition.

==== Withdrawal of ASTM D 6002 ====
In January 2011, the ASTM withdrew standard ASTM D 6002, which had provided plastic manufacturers with the legal credibility to label a plastic as [[compostable]]. Its description is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This guide covered suggested criteria, procedures, and a general approach to establish the compostability of environmentally degradable plastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D6002.htm|title=ASTM D6002 - 96(2002)e1 Standard Guide for Assessing the Compostability of Environmentally Degradable Plastics (Withdrawn 2011)|work=astm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ASTM has yet to replace this standard.

=== Biobased – ASTM D6866 ===
The ASTM D6866 method has been developed to certify the biologically derived content of bioplastics. Cosmic rays colliding with the atmosphere mean that some of the carbon is the radioactive isotope [[carbon-14]]. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere is used by plants in [[photosynthesis]], so new plant material will contain both carbon-14 and [[carbon-12]]. Under the right conditions, and over geological timescales, the remains of living organisms can be transformed into [[fossil fuels]]. After ~100,000 years all the carbon-14 present in the original organic material will have undergone radioactive decay leaving only carbon-12. A product made from [[biomass]] will have a relatively high level of carbon-14, while a product made from petrochemicals will have no carbon-14. The percentage of renewable carbon in a material (solid or liquid) can be measured with an accelerator [[mass spectrometer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D6866.htm |title=ASTM D6866 - 11 Standard Test Methods for Determining the Biobased Content of Solid, Liquid, and Gaseous Samples Using Radiocarbon Analysis |publisher=Astm.org |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/publications/nnfcc-newsletter-issue-16-understanding-bio-based-content |title=NNFCC Newsletter&amp;nbsp;– Issue 16. Understanding Bio-based Content&amp;nbsp;— NNFCC |publisher=Nnfcc.co.uk |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an important difference between biodegradability and biobased content. A bioplastic such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.braskem.com.br/site/portal_braskem/en/sala_de_imprensa/sala_de_imprensa_detalhes_6062.aspx |title=Braskem |publisher=Braskem |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be 100% biobased (i.e. contain 100% renewable carbon), yet be non-biodegradable. These bioplastics such as HDPE nonetheless play an important role in greenhouse gas abatement, particularly when they are combusted for energy production. The biobased component of these bioplastics is considered carbon-neutral since their origin is from biomass.

=== Anaerobic biodegradability – ASTM D5511-02 and ASTM D5526 ===
The ASTM D5511-12 and ASTM D5526-12 are testing methods that comply with international standards such as the ISO DIS 15985 for the biodegradability of plastic.

'''Biopolitics''' is an intersectional field between biology and politics. It is a political wisdom taking into consideration the administration of life and a locality’s populations as its subject. To quote Foucault, it is ‘to ensure, sustain, and multiply life, to put this life in order."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://criticallegalthinking.com/2017/05/10/michel-foucault-biopolitics-biopower/#fn-22546-9|title=History of Sexuality (The Will to Knowledge: History of Sexuality)|last=Foucault|first=Michael|publisher=|year=1976|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by [[Rudolf Kjellén]], who also coined the term [[geopolitics]],&lt;ref name="Esposito2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Roberto Esposito]]|title=Bios: Biopolitics and Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIZS2GpUzGwC&amp;pg=PA16|year=2008|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-4989-1|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his 1905 two-volume work ''The Great Powers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunneflo|first=Markus|year=2015|url=https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/014e3f7b-0a6b-4535-8e83-d04a04d2008c|title=Rudolf Kjellén: Nordic biopolitics before the welfare state|journal=[[Retfærd]]|volume=35|issue=3|issn=0105-1121}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary US [[political science]] studies, usage of the term is mostly divided between a [[Post-structuralism|poststructuralist]] group using the meaning assigned by [[Michel Foucault]] (denoting social and political power over life) and another group who uses it to denote studies relating [[biology and political science]].&lt;ref name="Liesen"&gt;Liesen, Laurette T. and Walsh, Mary Barbara, The Competing Meanings of 'Biopolitics' in Political Science: Biological and Post-Modern Approaches to Politics (2011).

==Various definitions==
#In Kjellén's [[organicism|organicist]] view, the [[State (polity)|state]] was a quasi-biological organism, a "super-individual creature". Kjellén sought to study "the civil war between social groups" (comprising the state) from a biological perspective and thus named his putative discipline "biopolitics".&lt;ref name="Lemke2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Thomas Lemke]]|title=Biopolitics: An Advanced Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cRVNFqFPGtoC&amp;pg=PA9|year=2011|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-5241-8|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[Nazi]]s also used the term occasionally. For example, [[Hans Conrad Julius Reiter|Hans Reiter]] used it in a 1934 speech to refer to their biologically based concept of nation and state and ultimately their [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial policy]].&lt;ref name="Liesen"/&gt;
#Previous notions of the concept can actually be traced back to the [[Middle Ages]] in [[John of Salisbury]]'s work ''[[Policraticus]]'' in which the coined term [[body politic]] is actually used. The first modern usage of the term (in English) starts with an article written by GW Harris in an article for the ''New Age'' in 1911 in which he advocates the liquidation of "lunatics" by 'state lethal chamber'.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Age'' 28 December 1911&lt;/ref&gt; The concept then starts to gather pace in the 19th century with [[Walter Bagehot]]'s work ''[[Physics and Politics]]'' in which he reflects on the term as if he was a trained scientist in the form of [[Jakob von Uexküll]]. Bagehot didn't have a scientifically trained mind such as von Uexküll so he (Bagehot) falls rather short in the explanation of the term. Nevertheless the book has some novel points particularly on the subject of [[natural selection]] and politics.&lt;ref&gt; Walter Bagehot Physics and Politics pp. 40-65 1872&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Morley Roberts]] in his 1938 book ''Bio-politics'' used to argue that a correct model for [[Geopolitics|world politics]] is "a loose association of cell and protozoa colonies".&lt;ref name="Liesen"/&gt;
#[[Robert E. Kuttner]] used the term to refer to his particular brand of "scientific racism," as he called it, which he worked out with noted [[Eustace Mullins]], with whom Kuttner cofounded the [[Institute for Biopolitics]] in the late 1950s, and also with [[Glayde Whitney]], a behavioral geneticist. Most of his [[Opposition (politics)|adversaries]] designate his model as antisemitic. Kuttner and Mullins were inspired by [[Morley Roberts]], who was in turn inspired by [[Arthur Keith]], or both were inspired by each other and either co-wrote together (or with the Institute of Biopolitics) ''Biopolitics of Organic Materialism'' dedicated to Roberts and reprinted some of his works.&lt;ref name="Jackson2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=John P.

== In the colonial setting ==
Catastrophes are periodically mobilized as vehicles for historical transformation. European states often found themselves grappling with sociobiological propensities of populations. Mercantilism and capitalist modes of production led to a modern biopolitical approach to famine: the modern state depended on providing a diet sufficient to keep the biological machines of industrial capitalism running. The British developed biopolitics in tandem with colonization to help solidify their control over the Irish. 

The French Third Republic in Western Africa also employed biopolitics in their colonial efforts. The ''fin-de-siecle'' revolution in microbiology and specific developments in public health legislation aided the French. Furthermore, thanks to the germ theory of disease pioneered by Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur, the etiology of some of the most deadly diseases—cholera and typhoid—began to be understood in the 1890s, and the French used this new scientific knowledge in the tropics of West Africa. Illnesses like bubonic plague were isolated, and vectors of malaria and yellow fever were identified for the political purpose of public health. They passed public health laws to introduce up-to-date health standards. The goal was for African subjects to respond in exactly the same way as metropolitan citizens to market incentives and new technologies imposed by a progressive state. Thus, public health was a political concern in the sense that the state hoped citizens would be more productive if they lived longer.

==Michel Foucault==
French philosopher and social theorist [[Michel Foucault]] first discussed his thoughts on biopolitics in his lecture series "Society Must Be Defended" given at the [[Collège de France]] from 1975 to 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Society Must Be Defended|last = Michel|first = Foucault|publisher = Picador|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = 242–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foucault's concept of biopolitics is largely derived from his own notion of [[biopower]], and the extension of [[Political power|state power]] over both the physical and political bodies of a population.  While only mentioned briefly in his "Society Must Be Defended" lectures, his notion of the concept of biopolitics (Foucault never invented the concept) has become prominent in social and humanistic sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, T., Casper, M. J., &amp; Moore, L. J. (2011). Biopolitics: an advanced introduction. NYU Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foucault described biopolitics as "a new technology of power...[that] exists at a different level, on a different scale, and [that] has a different bearing area, and makes use of very different instruments."&lt;ref name="Foucault 1997 242"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Society Must Be Defended: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1975-1976|year=1997|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0312422660|pages=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than a disciplinary mechanism, Foucault's biopolitics acts as a control apparatus exerted over a population as a whole or, as Foucault stated, "a global mass."&lt;ref name="Foucault 1997 242"/&gt; In the years that followed, Foucault continued to develop his notions of the biopolitical in his "The Birth of Biopolitics" and "The Courage of Truth" lectures.&lt;ref&gt;[[Woodrow Wilson]] (1918) The New Freedom pp.45-48 Englewood Cliffs, N.J., Prentice-Hall&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault (2007) Security, Territory, Population 1977-1978 pp. 311-332 pp. 333-361 pp. 378-380&lt;/ref&gt; 

Foucault gave numerous examples of biopolitical control when he first mentioned the concept in 1976.  These examples include "ratio of births to deaths, the rate of reproduction, the fertility of a population, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Society Must Be Defended: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1975-1976|year=1997|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0312422660|pages=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contrasted this method of social control with political power in the Middle Ages. Whereas in the Middle Ages pandemics made death a permanent and perpetual part of life, this was then shifted around the end of the 18th century with the introduction of [[Milieu intérieur|milieu]] into the [[Biological Sciences|biological sciences]]. Foucault then gives different contrasts to the then [[Physical Sciences|physical sciences]] in which the [[industrialisation]] of the population was coming to the fore through the concept of work, where Foucault then argues power starts to become a target for this milieu by the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Security, Territory, Population Lectures At The College de France|last=Michel|first=Foucault|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=55-86, 20, 27 (Note 37)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Society Must Be Defended|last=Michel|first=Foucault|publisher=|year=1975|isbn=|location=|pages=241-244, 252}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of vaccines and medicines dealing with public hygiene allowed death to be held (and/or withheld) from certain populations.  This was the introduction of "more subtle, more rational mechanisms: insurance, individual and collective savings, safety measures, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Society Must Be Defended: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1975-1976|year=1997|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0312422660|pages=243–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4332">In [[general relativity]], the '''Carminati–McLenaghan invariants''' or '''CM scalars''' are a set of 16 scalar [[curvature invariant]]s for the [[Riemann tensor]].  This set is usually supplemented with at least two additional invariants.

==Mathematical definition==

The CM invariants consist of 6 real scalars plus 5 complex scalars, making a total of 16 invariants.  They are defined in terms of the [[Weyl tensor]] &lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; and its right (or left) dual &lt;math&gt;{{}^\star C}_{ijkl}=(1/2)\epsilon_{klmn}C_{ij}{}^{mn}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Ricci tensor]] &lt;math&gt;R_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;, and the ''trace-free Ricci tensor''
:&lt;math&gt; S_{ab} = R_{ab} - \frac{1}{4} \, R \, g_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;
In the following, it may be helpful to note that if we regard &lt;math&gt;{S^a}_b&lt;/math&gt; as a matrix, then &lt;math&gt;{S^a}_m \, {S^m}_b&lt;/math&gt; is the ''square'' of this matrix, so the ''trace'' of the square is &lt;math&gt;{S^a}_b \, {S^b}_a&lt;/math&gt;, and so forth.  

The real CM scalars are:
#&lt;math&gt;R = {R^m}_m&lt;/math&gt; (the trace of the [[Ricci tensor]])
#&lt;math&gt;R_1 = \frac{1}{4} \, {S^a}_b \, {S^b}_a&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;R_2 = -\frac{1}{8} \, {S^a}_b \, {S^b}_c \, {S^c}_a&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;R_3 = \frac{1}{16} \, {S^a}_b \, {S^b}_c \, {S^c}_d \, {S^d}_a&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;M_3 = \frac{1}{16} \, S^{bc} \, S_{ef} \left( C_{abcd} \, C^{aefd} + {{}^\star C}_{abcd} \, {{}^\star C}^{aefd} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;M_4 = -\frac{1}{32} \, S^{ag} \, S^{ef} \, {S^c}_d \, \left( {C_{ac}}^{db} \, C_{befg} + {{{}^\star C}_{ac}}^{db} \, {{}^\star C}_{befg} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
The complex CM scalars are:
#&lt;math&gt;W_1 = \frac{1}{8} \, \left( C_{abcd} + i \, {{}^\star C}_{abcd} \right) \, C^{abcd}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;W_2 = -\frac{1}{16} \, \left( {C_{ab}}^{cd} + i \, {{{}^\star C}_{ab}}^{cd} \right) \, {C_{cd}}^{ef} \, {C_{ef}}^{ab}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;M_1 = \frac{1}{8} \, S^{ab} \, S^{cd} \, \left( C_{acdb} + i \, {{}^\star C}_{acdb} \right)&lt;/math&gt; 
#&lt;math&gt;M_2 = \frac{1}{16} \, S^{bc} \, S_{ef} \, \left( C_{abcd} \, C^{aefd} -  {{}^\star C}_{abcd} \, {{}^\star C}^{aefd} \right) + \frac{1}{8} \, i \, S^{bc} \, S_{ef} \, {{}^\star C}_{abcd} \, C^{aefd}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;M_5 = \frac{1}{32} \, S^{cd} \, S^{ef} \, \left( C^{aghb} +  i \, {{}^\star C}^{aghb} \right) \, \left( C_{acdb} \, C_{gefh} + {{}^\star C}_{acdb} \, {{}^\star C}_{gefh} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The CM scalars have the following [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]]s:
#&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is linear,
#&lt;math&gt;R_1, \, W_1&lt;/math&gt; are quadratic,
#&lt;math&gt;R_2, \, W_2, \, M_1&lt;/math&gt; are cubic,
#&lt;math&gt;R_3, \, M_2, \, M_3&lt;/math&gt; are quartic,
#&lt;math&gt;M_4, \, M_5&lt;/math&gt; are quintic.
They can all be expressed directly in terms of the [[Ricci spinors]] and [[Weyl spinors]], using [[Newman–Penrose formalism]]; see the link below.

==Complete sets of invariants==
In the case of [[spherically symmetric spacetime]]s or planar symmetric spacetimes, it is known that 
:&lt;math&gt;R, \, R_1, \, R_2, \, R_3, \, \Re (W_1), \, \Re (M_1), \, \Re (M_2)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{32} \, S^{cd} \, S^{ef} \, C^{aghb} \, C_{acdb} \, C_{gefh}&lt;/math&gt;
comprise a [[complete set]] of invariants for the Riemann tensor.  In the case of [[vacuum solution (general relativity)|vacuum solution]]s, [[electrovacuum solution]]s and perfect [[fluid solution]]s, the CM scalars comprise a complete set.  Additional invariants may be required for more general spacetimes; determining the exact number (and possible [[Syzygy (mathematics)|syzygies]] among the various invariants) is an open problem.

The '''Civil Rights Game''' was an annual [[Major League Baseball]] game that honors the history of [[civil rights]] in the [[United States]] and marked the unofficial end to the league's [[spring training]].

The first Civil Rights game was played in 2007 .The first two games were held at [[AutoZone Park]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. The intent of the game was to "embrace baseball's history of [[African-American]] players", as well as to generate interest for future black players, after a demographics survey revealed that the percentage of black players in the league has dwindled over the past twelve years to just 8.4 percent.&lt;ref name="8.4 percent"&gt;{{cite news|title=Only 8.4 Percent of Major Leaguers Were Black Last Season|url=http://m.espn.go.com/mlb/story?storyId=2818145|accessdate=October 3, 2014|work=mobile ESPN.com|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=March 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey also gave the diversity of players in Major League Baseball an A+ grade: while African-Americans in the sport since 1996 dropped from 17 percent to 8 percent, the percentage of Hispanic players (many of them blacks from the Caribbean) increased during that period from 20 percent to 29 percent, and Asian and other minorities increased from 1 percent to 3 percent. The percentage of non-Hispanic white players went down from 62 percent to 60 percent during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lapchick|first1=Richard|last2=Ekiyor|first2=Boma|last3=Ruiz|first3=Horacio|title=The 2006 Racial and Gender Report Card: Major League Baseball|url=http://www.tidesport.org/RGRC/2006/2006_RGRC_MLB.pdf|website=[[University of Central Florida College of Business Administration]]|publisher=The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES)|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the game became a regular season game. It has not been held since 2016, for reasons unknown.

Baseball Commissioner [[Bud Selig]] commented on air during the first Civil Rights game that the 8 percent total for African-Americans was "a problem that needed to be looked at." [[Associated Press]] news releases related to the game focused on the drop in African-Americans, and quoted former Cleveland pitcher [[CC Sabathia]] on the idea that baseball must do more to promote the game in inner cities, saying, "It's not just a problem—it's a crisis."&lt;ref name="8.4 percent"/&gt;

In conjunction with the Civil Rights Game, Major League Baseball honors three pioneers of civil rights with the Beacon Awards (Beacon of Life Award, Beacon of Change Award and Beacon of Hope Award).

==Game summaries==

===2000s===

====Inaugural game====
The inaugural game was played on Saturday, March 31, 2007 at 5:30 p.m. and was broadcast nationally on [[ESPN Major League Baseball|ESPN]] and [[ESPNHD]]. It was announced by ESPN's #1 broadcast team of [[Jon Miller]] and [[Joe Morgan]], with [[Peter Gammons]] serving as a field analyst (his role during ''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]'' telecasts on ESPN). The game featured the [[2007 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[2007 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]]. Both teams wore uniforms reminiscent of those worn in [[Negro League]] games. The Cardinals won 5&amp;ndash;1, receiving a solid five-inning start out of their 2006 closer [[Adam Wainwright]], who got the [[Win (baseball)|win]].

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:ALC-CLE-Insignia.png|right|150px|thumb|Controversial [[Cleveland Indians|Indians]] logo: [[Chief Wahoo]].]] --&gt;
Selig came under heavy fire from [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s, who feel that the involvement of the [[Cleveland Indians]] was a slap in the face to the [[Cherokee]] people who still live in the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] area after the infamous [[Trail of Tears]] passed through less than 200 years ago. The ''[[New York Daily News]]'' called the situation a "primer on how to inadvertently stage an ironic insult to a local and large population of Natives" and insinuated that the league has (inadvertently) sabotaged the game by inviting the Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/2007/03/08/2007-03-08_seligs_uncivil_wrong-2.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Selig's Uncivil Wrong | date=March 8, 2007 | first=Filip | last=Bondy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sports blog [[Deadspin]] asked the question "If the Indians win, do Native Americans get civil rights?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=If The Indians Win, Do Native Americans Get Civil Rights?|url=http://deadspin.com/248670/if-the-indians-win-do-native-americans-get-civil-rights|website=[[Deadspin]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|accessdate=October 3, 2014|format=Blog|date=March 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2008 game====
On December 3, 2007, league officials announced details for the second annual game. It was played on March 29, 2008. The [[2008 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] beat the [[2008 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] 3&amp;ndash;2.  [[Martin Luther King III]] threw out the first pitch.  This has been the lowest attended game, to date, primarily because it was held at a minor league park during cool, rainy weather.

====2009 game====
On June 20, 2009, the Civil Rights Game was played for the first time as part of the regular season schedule.  The game took place at [[Great American Ball Park]] in [[Cincinnati]] between the host [[2009 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] and the [[2009 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]]. The White Sox defeated the Reds, 10&amp;ndash;8.  For this game, the teams wore replicas of their 1965 uniforms.  The White Sox became the first team to participate in two Civil Rights Games. The game was broadcast on [[MLB Network]] except in the home markets of the two teams that played in the game, Cincinnati ([[FSN Ohio]]) and Chicago ([[CSN Chicago]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Masilak|first1=Jim|title=Baseball Says Civil Rights Game Will Move to Cincinnati For 2009|url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/business/source-says-civil-rights-game-will-move-cincinnati|accessdate=October 3, 2014|work=[[The Commercial Appeal]]|publisher=[[The E.W. Scripps Company]]|date=September 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the end of the 2011 season, this game marks the last time the White Sox have actually worn white socks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===2010s===

====2010 game====
Cincinnati again hosted the Civil Rights Game on May 15, 2010. The Reds defeated the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in a dramatic 4–3 game that ended when Reds SS Orlando Cabrera took a relay throw from LF Chris Heisey at the base of the left field wall and gunned down Skip Schumaker at home plate trying to score the tying run from first base on Joe Mather's double.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Strong Throw Helps Reds Take Out Cardinals|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=300515117|accessdate=October 3, 2014|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=[[Associated Press]]/[[STATS LLC]]|date=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both teams wore replicas of their 1954 uniforms for this game, the first season both teams [[List of first black Major League Baseball players by team and date|fielded their first black players]]. Again, MLB Network telecast the game except in Cincinnati (Fox Sports Ohio) and St. Louis ([[Fox Sports Midwest]]).

====2011 game====
During the 2010 season, it was announced that [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] had been selected to host the 2011 and 2012 Civil Rights Games at [[Turner Field]], home of the [[2011 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Atlanta Braves to host 2011 and 2012 Civil Rights Game Weekends |publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P.

Additionally, the festivities have been expanded from two days to four days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowman|first1=Mark|url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110112&amp;content_id=16429522&amp;vkey=news_atl&amp;c_id=atl|title=Civil Rights Game to Feature Braves, Phillies|work=[[MLB.com]]|date=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Major League Baseball on TBS|TBS]] carried the game outside the Philadelphia and Atlanta [[Media market|DMA]]s.

For the Civil Rights Game, the Braves and the Phillies wore their 1974 throwback jerseys to honor [[Hank Aaron]]'s record-breaking 715th home run in 1974 as a member of the Atlanta Braves. In the previous game of the series, both teams wore [[Negro league baseball|Negro League]] uniforms from their respective cities, the [[Atlanta Black Crackers]] for the Braves and the [[Philadelphia Stars (baseball)|Philadelphia Stars]] for the Phillies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scott|first= Kyle|url=http://www.crossingbroad.com/2011/05/phillies-will-wear-1974-throwbacks-on-sunday.html

The game was a pitching duel against two of the National League's best pitchers, [[Tim Hudson]] of the Braves and [[Roy Halladay]] of the Phillies. Both pitchers had very good starts, with Hudson going seven and giving up just two runs on a [[John Mayberry Jr.]] home run. Halladay worked eight innings, giving up a leadoff eighth-inning home run to [[Dan Uggla]] to put the Braves in front. [[Craig Kimbrel]] of the Braves closed the game out, earning his tenth save of the season.

====2012 game====
Like the 2011 Game, the 2012 Game was held at [[Turner Field]] in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]. The Atlanta Braves organization announced on February 21 that the game would be the August 19 series finale versus the [[2012 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]]. The three-game weekend series from August 17 to 19 will again be incorporated into the Civil Rights Game Weekend, an event that will honor those on and off the field who have paved the way for equal rights for all Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120221&amp;content_id=26773698&amp;vkey=pr_atl&amp;c_id=atl|title=Atlanta Braves 2012 Single Game Tickets|work=atlantabraves.com|date=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013 game====
The 2013 Game was held at [[US Cellular Field]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] on August 24, when the [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]] beat the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] by a score of 3–2.

====2014 game====
It was announced on November 19, 2013 that the 2014 Game will be held at [[Minute Maid Park]] in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] on May 30, when the [[Houston Astros|Astros]] host the [[Baltimore Orioles|Orioles]]. Houston beat Baltimore 2–1. For the game, the Astros were known as the Houston Eagles (after the only Negro League team in Texas) and Baltimore played as the Baltimore Elite Giants.

====2015 game====
The 2015 Game was held on April 15 at [[Dodger Stadium]] in [[Los Angeles]] which saw the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]] host the [[Seattle Mariners|Mariners]]. It was the first Civil Rights Game played on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. This is, to date, the last Civil Rights game ever played.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16129">'''Data-driven control systems''' are a broad family of [[Control theory|control systems]], in which the [[System identification|identification]] of the process model and/or the design of the controller are based entirely on ''experimental data'' collected from the plant &lt;ref&gt;Bazanella, A.S., Campestrini, L., Eckhard, D. (2012). Data-driven controller design: the &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt; approach. Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-007-2300-9}}, 208 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In many control applications, trying to write a mathematical model of the plant is considered a hard task, requiring efforts and time to the process and control engineers. This problem is overcome by ''data-driven'' methods, which allow to fit a system model to the experimental data collected, choosing it in a specific models class. The control engineer can then exploit this model to design a proper controller for the system. However, it is still difficult to find a simple yet reliable model for a physical system, that includes only those dynamics of the system that are of interest for the control specifications. The ''direct'' data-driven methods allow to tune a controller, belonging to a given class, without the need of an identified model of the system. In this way, one can also simply weight process dynamics of interest inside the control cost function, and exclude those dynamics that are out of interest.

== Overview ==

The ''standard'' approach to control systems design is organized in two-steps: 
# Model identification aims at estimating a nominal model of the system &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G} = G\left(q; \widehat{\theta}_N\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the unit-delay operator (for discrete-time transfer functions representation) and &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\theta}_N&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of parameters of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; identified on a set of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; data. Then, validation consists in constructing the ''uncertainty set'' &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; that contains the true system &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt; at a certain probability level.
# Controller design aims at finding a controller &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; achieving closed-loop stability and meeting the required performance with &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt;.
Typical objectives of [[System Identification|system identification]] are to have &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; as close as possible to &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt;, and to have &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; as small as possible. However, from an [[System identification#Identification for control|identification for control]] perspective, what really matters is the performance achieved by the controller, not the intrinsic quality of the model.

One way to deal with uncertainty is to design a controller that has an acceptable performance with all models in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, including &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt;. This is the main idea behind [[robust control]] design procedure, that aims at building frequency domain uncertainty descriptions of the process. However, being based on worst-case assumptions rather than on the idea of averaging out the noise, this approach typically leads to ''conservative'' uncertainty sets. Rather, data-driven techniques deal with uncertainty by working on experimental data, and avoiding excessive conservativism.

In the following, the main classifications of data-driven control systems are presented.

=== Indirect and direct methods ===
There are many methods available to control the systems. 
The fundamental distinction is between '''indirect''' and '''direct''' controller design methods. The former group of techniques is still retaining the standard two-step approach, ''i.e.'' first a model is identified, then a controller is tuned based on such model. The main issue in doing so is that the controller is computed from the estimated model &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; (according to the [[Stochastic control#Certainty equivalence|certainty equivalence]] principle), but in practice &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G} \neq G_0&lt;/math&gt;. To overcome this problem, the idea behind the latter group of techniques is to map the experimental data ''directly'' onto the controller, without any model to be identified in between.

=== Iterative and noniterative methods ===

Another important distinction is between '''iterative''' and '''noniterative''' (or '''one-shot''') methods. In the former group, repeated iterations are needed to estimate the controller parameters, during which the [[Optimization_problem|optimization problem]] is performed based on the results of the previous iteration, and the estimation is expected to become more and more accurate at each iteration. This approach is also prone to on-line implementations (see below). In the latter group, the (optimal) controller parametrization is provided with a single optimization problem. This is particularly important for those systems in which iterations or repetitions of data collection experiments are limited or even not allowed (for example, due to economic aspects). In such cases, one should select a design technique capable of delivering a controller on a single data set. This approach is often implemented off-line (see below).

=== On-line and off-line methods ===

Since, on practical industrial applications, open-loop or closed-loop data are often available continuously, '''on-line''' data-driven techniques use those data to improve the quality of the identified model and/or the performance of the controller each time new information is collected on the plant. Instead, '''off-line''' approaches work on batch of data, which may be collected only once, or multiple times at a regular (but rather long) interval of time.

== Iterative feedback tuning ==

The iterative feedback tuning (IFT) method was introduced in 1994 &lt;ref&gt;Hjalmarsson, H., Gevers, M., Gunnarsson, S., &amp; Lequin, O. (1998). Iterative feedback tuning: theory and applications. IEEE control systems, 18(4), 26–41.&lt;/ref&gt;, starting from the observation that, in identification for control, each iteration is based on the (wrong) certainty equivalence principle.

IFT is a model-free technique for the direct iterative optimization of the parameters of a fixed-order controller; such parameters can be successively updated using information coming from standard (closed-loop) system operation.

Let &lt;math&gt;y^d&lt;/math&gt; be a desired output to the reference signal &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;; the error between the achieved and desired response is &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}(\rho)=y(\rho)-y^d&lt;/math&gt;. The control design objective can be formulated as the minimization of the objective function:

:&lt;math&gt; J(\rho) = \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{t=1}^N E\left[\tilde{y}(t,\rho)^2\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Given the objective function to minimize, the ''quasi-Newton method'' can be applied, i.e. a gradient-based minimization using a gradient search of the type:

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_{i+1} = \rho_i - \gamma_i R_i^{-1}  \frac{d\widehat{J}}{d\rho}(\rho_i). &lt;/math&gt;

The value &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i&lt;/math&gt; is the step size, &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; is an appropriate positive definite matrix and &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\widehat{J}}{d\rho}&lt;/math&gt; is an approximation of the gradient; the true value of the gradient is given by the following:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dJ}{d\rho} (\rho) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N \left[\tilde{y}(t,\rho)\frac{\delta y}{\delta \rho}(t,\rho)\right]. &lt;/math&gt;

The value of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta y}{\delta \rho}(t,\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is obtained through the following three-step methodology:

# Normal Experiment: Perform an experiment on the closed loop system with &lt;math&gt;C(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; as controller and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; as reference; collect N measurements of the output &lt;math&gt;y(\rho)&lt;/math&gt;, denoted as &lt;math&gt;y^{(1)} (\rho) &lt;/math&gt;.
# Gradient Experiment: Perform an experiment on the closed loop system with &lt;math&gt;C(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; as controller and 0 as reference &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;; inject the signal &lt;math&gt;r-y^{(1)} (\rho)&lt;/math&gt; such that it is summed to the control variable output by &lt;math&gt;C(\rho)&lt;/math&gt;, going as input into the plant. Collect the output, denoted as &lt;math&gt;y^{(2)} (\rho) &lt;/math&gt;.
# Take the following as gradient approximation: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta \widehat{y}}{\delta \rho} (\rho) = \frac{\delta C}{\delta \rho} (\rho) y^{(2)} (\rho)&lt;/math&gt;.

A crucial factor for the convergence speed of the algorithm is the choice of &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;; when &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}&lt;/math&gt; is small, a good choice is the approximation given by the Gauss–Newton direction:

: &lt;math&gt; R_i = \frac 1 N \sum_{t=1}^N \frac{\delta \widehat{y}}{\delta \rho} (\rho_i) \frac{\delta \widehat{y}^T}{\delta \rho} (\rho_i).&lt;/math&gt;

== Noniterative correlation-based tuning ==

Noniterative correlation-based tuning (nCbT) is a noniterative method for data-driven tuning of a fixed-structure controller&lt;ref&gt;van Heusden, K., Karimi, A. and Bonvin, D. (2011), Data-driven model reference control with asymptotically guaranteed stability. Int. J. Adapt. Control Signal Process., 25: 331–351. doi:10.1002/acs.1212&lt;/ref&gt;. It provides a one-shot method to directly synthesize a controller based on a single dataset.

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; denotes an unknown LTI stable SISO plant, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; a user-defined reference model and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; a user-defined weighting function. An LTI fixed-order controller is indicated as &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)=\beta^T \rho&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \rho \in \mathbb R ^n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of LTI basis functions. Finally, &lt;math&gt;K^*&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal LTI controller of any structure, guaranteeing a closed-loop function &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; when applied to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

The goal is to minimize the following objective function:

: &lt;math&gt;J(\rho)=\left\| F \bigg( \frac{ K^* G-K(\rho)G }{ (1+K^* G)^2 } \bigg) \right\|_2^2. &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;J(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is a convex approximation of the objective function obtained from a model reference problem, supposing that &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{ (1+K(\rho)G) } \approx \frac{1}{ (1+K^*G) }&lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is stable and minimum-phase, the approximated model reference problem is equivalent to the minimization of the norm of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt; in the scheme in figure.

[[File:Noniterative Correlation-based Tuning Scheme.svg|thumb|483x180px|The idea is that, when ''G'' is stable and minimum phase, the approximated model reference problem is equivalent to the minimization of the norm of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The input signal &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt; is supposed to be a persistently exciting input signal and &lt;math&gt;v(t)&lt;/math&gt; to be generated by a stable data-generation mechanism. The two signals are thus uncorrelated in an open-loop experiment; hence, the ideal error &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(t,\rho^* )&lt;/math&gt; is uncorrelated with &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The control objective thus consists in finding &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(t,\rho^* )&lt;/math&gt; are uncorrelated.

The vector of ''instrumental variables'' &lt;math&gt;\zeta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt; \zeta(t)=[r_W (t+\ell_1 ),r_W (t+\ell_1-1),\ldots,r_W (t),\ldots,r_W (t-\ell_1) ]^T &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; is large enough and &lt;math&gt;r_W (t)=Wr(t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is an appropriate filter.

The correlation function is:

: &lt;math&gt;f_{N,\ell_1} (\rho) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N \zeta(t) \varepsilon(t,\rho)&lt;/math&gt;

and the optimization problem becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\rho} = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} J_{N,\ell_1}(\rho) = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} f_{N,\ell_1}^T f_{N,\ell_1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Denoting with &lt;math&gt;\phi_r (\omega)&lt;/math&gt; the spectrum of &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt;, it can be demonstrated that, under some assumptions, if &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is selected as:

:&lt;math&gt;W(e^{-j\omega}) = \frac{F(e^{-j\omega})(1-M(e^{-j\omega}))}{\phi_r (\omega)}&lt;/math&gt;

then, the following holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{N,\ell_1 \to \infty, \ell_1/N \to \infty} \widehat{\rho} = \rho^*.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Stability constraint ===

There is no guarantee that the controller &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes &lt;math&gt;J_{N,\ell_1}&lt;/math&gt; is stable. Instability may occur in the following cases:

* If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is non-minimum phase, &lt;math&gt;K^*&lt;/math&gt; may lead to cancellations in the right-half complex plane.
* If &lt;math&gt;K^*&lt;/math&gt; (even if stabilizing) is not achievable, &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; may not be stabilizing.
* Due to measurement noise, even if &lt;math&gt;K^*=K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is stabilizing, data-estimated &lt;math&gt;\widehat{K}(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; may not be so.

Consider a stabilizing controller &lt;math&gt;K_s&lt;/math&gt; and the closed loop transfer function &lt;math&gt;M_s=\frac{K_s G}{1+K_s G}&lt;/math&gt;.
Define:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta(\rho) := M_s - K(\rho) G (1-M_s) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta(\rho) := \left\| \Delta(\rho) \right\|_\infty. &lt;/math&gt;

:'''Theorem''' 
:''The controller &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; stabilizes the plant &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; if

# &lt;math&gt; \Delta(\rho) &lt;/math&gt; is stable
# &lt;math&gt;\exist \delta_N \in (0,1) &lt;/math&gt; s.t. &lt;math&gt; \delta (\rho) \leq \delta_N. &lt;/math&gt;''

Condition 1. is enforced when:

* &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is stable
* &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; contains an integrator (it is canceled).

The model reference design with stability constraint becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_s = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} J(\rho) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \text{s.t. } \delta(\rho) \leq \delta_N. &lt;/math&gt;

A '''convex data-driven estimation''' of &lt;math&gt;\delta(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained through the [[discrete Fourier transform]]. 

Define the following:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \widehat{R}_r (\tau) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N r(t-\tau) r(t) \text{ for } \tau = -\ell_2,\ldots,\ell_2 \\[4pt]
&amp; \widehat{R}_{r\varepsilon} (\tau) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N r(t-\tau) \varepsilon(t,\rho) \text{ for } \tau = -\ell_2,\ldots,\ell_2.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For '''stable minimum phase plants''', the following '''convex data-driven oprimization problem''' is given:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\widehat{\rho} &amp; = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} J_{N,\ell_1}(\rho) \\[3pt]
&amp; \text{s.t.} \\[3pt]
&amp; \bigg| \sum_{\tau=-\ell_2}^{\ell_2} \widehat{R}_{r\varepsilon} (\tau,\rho) e^{-j\tau\omega_k} \bigg| \leq \delta_N \bigg| \sum_{\tau=-\ell_2}^{\ell_2} \widehat{R}_r (\tau,\rho) e^{-j\tau\omega_k} \bigg| \\[4pt]
\omega_k &amp; = \frac{2 \pi k}{2\ell_2+1}, \qquad k=0,\ldots,\ell_2+1.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Virtual reference feedback tuning ==

Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) is a noniterative method for data-driven tuning of a fixed-structure controller. It provides a one-shot method to directly synthesize a controller based on a single dataset.

VRFT was first proposed &lt;ref&gt;Guardabassi, Guido O., and Sergio M. Savaresi. "Approximate feedback linearization of discrete-time non-linear systems using virtual input direct design." Systems &amp; Control Letters 32.2 (1997): 63–74.&lt;/ref&gt; as &lt;math&gt;VRD^2&lt;/math&gt; and then fixed and extended  for LTI &lt;ref&gt;Campi, Marco C., Andrea Lecchini, and Sergio M. Savaresi. "Virtual reference feedback tuning: a direct method for the design of feedback controllers." Automatica 38.8 (2002): 1337–1346.&lt;/ref&gt; and LPV &lt;ref&gt;Formentin, S., Piga, D., Tóth, R., &amp; Savaresi, S. M. (2016). Direct learning of LPV controllers from data. Automatica, 65, 98–110.&lt;/ref&gt; systems.

The main idea is to define a desired closed loop model &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and to use its inverse dynamics to obtain a virtual reference &lt;math&gt;r_v (t)&lt;/math&gt; from the measured output signal &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning Scheme.svg|thumb|483x180px|The main idea is to define a desired closed loop model M and to use its inverse dynamics to obtain a virtual reference from the measured output signal y.]]

The virtual signals are &lt;math&gt;r_v (t)=M^{-1} y(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; e_v (t)=r_v (t) - y(t). &lt;/math&gt;

The optimal controller is obtained from noiseless data by solving the following optimization problem:

: &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\rho}_\infty = \underset{\rho}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} \lim_{N \to \infty} J_{vr} (\rho)&lt;/math&gt;

where the optimization function is given as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; J_{vr}^N (\rho) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N \left(u(t)-K(\rho) e_v(t) \right)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

It is currently observed in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[India]] and [[Member states of the Council of Europe|47 European countries]].

Data Privacy Day's educational initiative originally focused on [[consciousness raising|raising awareness]] among businesses as well as users about the importance of protecting the privacy of their personal information online, particularly in the context of [[social networking]].  The educational focus has expanded over the past four years to include families, consumers and businesses.  In addition to its educational initiative, Data Privacy Day promotes events and activities that stimulate the development of technology tools that promote individual control over [[personally identifiable information]]; encourage compliance with [[privacy laws]] and regulations; and create dialogues among stakeholders interested in advancing data protection and privacy.  The international celebration offers many opportunities for collaboration among governments, industry, academia, nonprofits, privacy professionals and educators.

The [[Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data]] was opened for signature by the [[Council of Europe]] on January 28, 1981. This convention is currently in the process of being updated in order to reflect new legal challenges caused by technological development. The [[Convention on Cybercrime]] is also protecting the integrity of data systems and thus of privacy in cyberspace. Privacy including data protection is also protected by [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]].

The day was initiated by the [[Council of Europe]] to be first held in 2007 as the European Data Protection Day.
Two years later, on January 26, 2009, the United States [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] passed House Resolution HR 31 by a vote of 402–0, declaring January 28 National Data Privacy Day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.res.00031/ H.Res.31 Expressing support for the designation of January 28, 2009 as "National Data Privacy Day"]&lt;/ref&gt; On January 28, 2009, the Senate passed Senate Resolution 25 also recognizing January 28, 2009 as National Data Privacy Day. The [[United States Senate]] also recognized Data Privacy Day in 2010 and 2011.

In response to the increasing levels of data breaches and the global importance of privacy and data security, in 2009 the Online Trust Alliance (OTA) and dozens of global organizations embraced Data Privacy Day as '''Data Privacy &amp; Protection Day''', emphasizing the need to look at the long-term impact to consumers of data collection, use and protection practices. Other organizations including the [[National Cyber Security Alliance]] work to coordinate Data Privacy Day activities in the U.S.[4]

==Participating organizations==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32779">The '''disposable soma theory of aging''' states that organisms age due to an evolutionary trade-off between growth, reproduction, and [[DNA repair|DNA repair maintenance]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kirkwood, T. | year = 1977 | title = Evolution of ageing | journal = Nature | volume = 270 | issue = | pages = 301–304 | doi=10.1038/270301a0| bibcode = 1977Natur.270..301K }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Formulated by [[Thomas Kirkwood]], the disposable soma theory explains that an organism only has a limited amount of resources or "soma" that it can allocate to its various [[cellular processes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Gavrilov LA, Gavrilova NS | year = 2002 | title = Evolutionary theories of aging and longevity | journal = ScientificWorldJournal | volume = 7 | issue =2 | pages = 339–356 | doi=10.1100/tsw.2002.96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a greater investment in growth and reproduction would result in reduced investment in DNA repair maintenance, leading to increased [[Cell damage|cellular damage]], [[telomere#shortening|shortened telomeres]], accumulation of [[mutation#harmful mutations|mutations]], compromised [[stem cells]], and ultimately, [[senescence]]. Although many models, both animal and human, have appeared to support this theory, parts of it are still controversial. 
Specifically, while the [[evolutionary trade-off]] between [[Mechanistic target of rapamycin#Aging|growth and aging]] has been well established, 
the relationship between reproduction and aging is still without [[scientific consensus]], and the cellular mechanisms largely undiscovered.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Blagosklonny, MV | year = 2010| title = Why the disposable soma theory cannot explain why women live longer and why we age | journal = Aging | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 884–887 | doi=10.18632/aging.100253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and history ==

British biologist Thomas Kirkwood first proposed the disposable soma theory of aging in a 1977 [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] review article.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The theory was inspired by [[Leslie Orgel|Leslie Orgel's]] [[Error catastrophe|Error Catastrophe Theory of Aging]], which was published fourteen years earlier, in 1963. Orgel believed that the process of aging arose due to mutations acquired during the replication process, and Kirkwood developed the disposable soma theory in order to mediate Orgel's work with [[evolutionary genetics]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Principles==
The disposable soma theory of aging acts on the premise that there is a tradeoff in [[resource allocation]] between [[Maintenance of an organism|somatic maintenance]] and [[Parental investment|reproductive investment]]. Too low an investment in self-repair would be evolutionarily unsound, as the organism would likely die before reproductive age. However, too high an investment in self-repair would also be [[Fitness (biology)|evolutionarily unsound]] due to the fact that one's [[Survivorship curve|offspring would likely die before reproductive age]]. Therefore, there is a compromise and resources are partitioned accordingly. However, this compromise is thought to damage somatic repair systems, which can lead to [[DNA damage theory of aging|progressive cellular damage and senescence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Drenos F, Kirkwood, TB | year = 2005| title = Modelling the disposable soma theory of ageing | journal = Mech Ageing Dev. | volume = 126 | issue = 1 | pages = 99–103| doi=10.1016/j.mad.2004.09.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repair costs can be categorized into three groups: (1) the costs of increased [[Regeneration (biology)#Tissues|durability of nonrenewable parts]]; (2) the costs of maintenance involving [[Autophagy|cell renewal]], and (3) the costs of intracellular maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kirkwood, TB, Rose MR | year = 1991| title = Evolution of senescence: late survival sacrificed for reproduction.| journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 332 | issue = 1262 | pages = 15–24| doi=10.1098/rstb.1991.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a nutshell, [[Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis|aging and decline is essentially a tradeoff]] for increased reproductive robustness in youth.

== Mechanisms == 
[[File:IGF-1Pathway.png|thumb|The [[IGF-1|IGF-1 pathway]], which represses [[FOXO]], thus preventing [[gene expression]] of longevity-inducing proteins.]]

=== Growth and somatic maintenance === 
{{main|Mechanistic target of rapamycin#Aging}}
Much research has been done on the antagonistic effects of increased growth on lifespan. Specifically, the hormone [[insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1), binds to a cell receptor, leading to a [[phosphorylation cascade]]. This cascade results in kinases phosphorylating [[FOX proteins|forkhead transcription factor]] (FOXO), deactivating it. Deactivation of FOXO results in an inability to express genes involved in responding to [[oxidative stress |oxidative stress response]], such as [[antioxidants]], [[Chaperone (protein)|chaperones]], and [[heat-shock proteins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=O'Neill BT, Lee KY, Klaus K, Softic S; et al. | year = 2016 | title = Insulin and IGF-1 receptors regulate FoxO-mediated signaling in muscle proteostasis | journal = J Clin Invest | volume = 126 | issue = 9 | pages = 3433-3346 | doi=10.1172/JCI86522| pmc = 5004956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Additionally, uptake of IGF-1 stimulates the [[Mechanistic target of rapamycin|mTOR]] pathway, which activates protein synthesis (and therefore growth) through upregulation of the translation-promoting [[P70-S6 Kinase 1|S6K1]], and also inhibits [[autophagy]], a process necessary for recycling of damaged cellular products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Johnson SC, Rabinovitch PS, Kaeberlein M| year = 2013 | title = mTOR is a key modulator of ageing and age-related disease| journal = Nature | volume = 493 | issue = | pages = 338–345 | doi=10.1038/nature11861| bibcode = 2013Natur.493..338J| pmc = 3687363}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Decline of autophagy causes [[neurodegeneration]], [[protein aggregation]] and [[premature aging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Komatsu M, Waguri S, Chiba T, Murata S; et al. | year = 2006 | title = Loss of autophagy in the central nervous system causes neurodegeneration in mice | journal = Nature | volume = 441 | issue = | pages = 880–884 | doi=10.1038/nature04723| bibcode = 2006Natur.441..880K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, studies have also indicated that the mTOR pathway also alters [[immune responses]] and  stimulates [[cyclin-dependent kinase]] (CDK) inhibitors such as [[p16]] and [[p21]]. This leads to alteration of the [[stem-cell niche]] and results in [[Stem cell theory of aging|stem cell exhaustion]], another theorized mechanism of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Castilho RM1, Squarize CH, Chodosh LA, Williams BO; et al. | year = 2009| title = mTOR mediates Wnt-induced epidermal stem cell exhaustion and aging.| journal = Cell Stem Cell | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 279–289. | doi=10.1016/j.stem.2009.06.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproduction and somatic maintenance===
The mechanism of why reproduction inhibits lifespan with regards to multicellular organisms is still unclear. Although many models do illustrate an inverse relationship, and the theory makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, [[Cell signaling|the cellular mechanisms]] have yet to be explored. However, with regards to [[cellular replication]], the progressive shortening of telomeres is a mechanism which [[Hayflick limit|limits the amount of generations of a single cell may undergo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Shay JW, Wright WE | year = 2011 | title = Role of telomeres and telomerase in cancer | journal = Semin Cancer Biol. | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 349–353 | doi=10.1016/j.semcancer.2011.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, in unicellular organisms like ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', the formation of [[extrachromosomal rDNA circle]]s (ERCs) in mother cells (but not daughter cells) upon every subsequent division is an identifiable type of DNA damage that is associated with replication. These ERCs accumulate over time and eventually trigger replicative senescence and death of the mother cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kaeberlein M, McVey M, Guarente L | year = 1999 | title = The SIR2/3/4 complex and SIR2 alone promote longevity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by two different mechanisms| journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 13 | issue = 19| pages = 2570–2580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==

===Growth and aging===
There is a large body of evidence indicating the negative effects of growth on longevity across many species. As a general rule, individuals of a smaller size generally live longer than larger individuals of the same species.

==== Animal models ====
In [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] models of [[Mus musculus|mice]], such Snell or Ames mice, mutations have arisen, either rendering them incapable of producing IGF-1 or unable to have adequate receptors for IGF-1 uptake. Furthermore, mice injected with growth hormone have been shown to have progressive weight loss, roughing of the coat, [[Scoliosis|curvature of the spine]], [[Hypertrophy|enlargement of the organs]], kidney lesions and [[Cancer|increased cancer risk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Bartke A1, Brown-Borg H | year = 2004 | title = Life extension in the dwarf mouse | journal = Curr Top Dev Biol. | volume = 63 | issue =  | pages = 189–225| doi=10.1016/j.semcancer.2011.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is also seen in different breeds of [[dogs]], where smaller breeds of dogs typically live significantly longer compared to their larger counterparts. Selectively bred for their small size, smaller dog breeds like the [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] (average lifespan of 15–20 years) have the B/B genotype for the IGF-1 [[haplotype]], reducing the amount of IGF-1 produced. Conversely, large dogs like the [[Great Dane]] (average lifespan of 6–8 years) are [[homozygous]] for the IGF-1 I [[allele]], which increases the amount of IGF-1 production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Sutter NB, Bustamante CD, Chase K, Gray MM | year = 2007| title =A Single IGF1 Allele Is a Major Determinant of Small Size in Dogs| journal = Science | volume = 316 | issue = 5821 | pages = 112–115 | doi=10.1126/science.1137045| bibcode =2007Sci...316..112S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Human models====
Initially, it was believed that growth hormone actually prolonged lifespan due to a 1990 study that indicated that injection of [[growth hormone]] to men over 60 years of age appeared to reverse various [[biomarkers]] implicated in aging, such as [[Sarcopenia|decreased muscle mass]], bone density, skin thickness, and increased adipose tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Rudman D1, Feller AG, Nagraj HS, Gergans GA; et al. | year = 1990| title =Effects of human growth hormone in men over 60 years old| journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 323 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–6 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199007053230101}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 1999 study found that administering growth hormone also significantly increased [[mortality rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Takala J1, Ruokonen E, Webster NR, Nielsen MS, Zandstra DF, et al. | year = 1999| title =
Increased mortality associated with growth hormone treatment in critically ill adults| journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 341 | issue = 11 | pages = 785–792 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199909093411102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[Genome Sequencing|genomic studies]] have confirmed that the genes involved in growth hormone uptake and signaling are largely conserved across a plethora of species, such as yeast, nematodes, fruit flies, mice and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Longo VD, Finch CE.| year = 2003| title =Evolutionary medicine: from dwarf model systems to healthy centenarians?| journal = Science | volume = 299 | issue = 5611 | pages = 1342–1346 | doi=10.1126/science.1077991}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies have also shown that individuals with [[Laron syndrome]], an [[autosomal recessive]] disorder resulting in dwarfism due to defects in growth hormone receptors, have increased lifespan. Additionally, these individuals have much lower [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidences]] of age-related diseases such as [[type 2 diabetes]] and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Guevara-Aguirre J, Balasubramanian P, Guevara-Aguirre M, Wei M; et al. | year = 2011| title = Growth hormone receptor deficiency is associated with a major reduction in pro-aging signaling, cancer, and diabetes in humans | journal = Sci. Transl. Med. | volume = 3 | issue = 70 | pages = 70–83 | doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3001845}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lastly, human [[centenarians]] around the world are disproportionately of [[short stature]], and have low levels of IGF-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Govindaraju D, Atzmon G, Barzilai N. | year = 2015| title =Genetics, lifestyle and longevity: Lessons from centenarians.| journal = Appl Transl Genom.  | volume = 4| issue =  | pages = 23–32 | doi=10.1016/j.atg.2015.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction and aging===
Numerous studies have found that lifespan is inversely correlated with both the total amount of offspring birthed, as well as the age at which females first gives birth, also known as primiparity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Descamps S, Boutin S, Berteaux D, Gaillard JM.| year = 2006| title =Best squirrels trade a long life for an early reproduction| journal = Proc Biol Sci   | volume = 273| issue = 1599 | pages = 2369–2374 | doi= 10.1098/rspb.2006.3588}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it has been found that [[Sexual reproduction|reproduction]] is a costly mechanism that alters the [[Fatty acid metabolism|metabolism of fat]]. [[Lipids]] invested in reproduction would be unable to be allocated to support mechanisms involved in somatic maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hansen M, Flatt T, Aguilaniu H.| year = 2013| title =Reproduction, fat metabolism, and life span: what is the connection?| journal = Cell Metab.| volume = 17| issue = 1 | pages = 10–19 | doi= 10.1016/j.cmet.2012.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==== Animal models ====

The disposable soma theory has been consistent with the majority of animal models. It was found in numerous animal studies that [[castration]] or [[Genetic disorder|genetic deformities]] of [[Reproductive system|reproduction organs]] was [[correlated]] with increased lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Drori D, Folman Y.| year = 1976| title =Environmental effects on longevity in the male rat: exercise, mating, castration and restricted feeding| journal = Exp Gerontol.| volume = 11| issue = 1 | pages = 25–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Flatt T| year = 2011| title =Survival costs of reproduction in ''Drosophila''.| journal = Exp Gerontol.| volume = 46| issue = 5 | pages = 369–375 | doi= 10.1016/j.exger.2010.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hsin H, Kenyon C| year = 1999| title =Signals from the reproductive system regulate the lifespan of ''C. elegans''| journal =Nature| volume =399| issue = 6734 | pages = 362–366 | doi= 10.1038/20694| bibcode =1999Natur.399..362H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in [[red squirrels]], it was found that females with an early primiparity achieved the highest immediate and lifetime reproductive success. However, it was also found that these same individuals had a decreased median and maximum lifespan. Specifically squirrels who mated earlier had a 22.4% rate of mortality until two years of age compared to a 16.5% rate of mortality in late breeders. In addition, these squirrels had an average maximum lifespan of 1035 days compared to an average maximum lifespan of 1245 days for squirrels that bred later.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

In another study, researchers selectively bred [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] over three years to develop two different [[strain (biology)|strain]]s, an early-reproducing strain and a late-reproducing strain. The late-reproducing line had a significantly longer lifespan than the early-reproducing line. Even more telling was that when the researchers introduced a mutation in the [[Ovarian|ovarian-associated]] gene ''ovoD1'', resulting in defective [[oogenesis]], the differences in lifespan between the two lines disappeared. The researchers in this case concluded that "aging has evolved primarily because of the damaging effects of reproduction earlier in life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Sgrò CM, Partridge L| year = 1999| title = A delayed wave of death from reproduction in Drosophila.| journal =Science| volume =286| issue =5449 | pages = 2521–2524 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent aging researcher [[Steven N. Austad|Steven Austad]] also performed a large-scale [[ecological]] study on the [[coast]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1993. Austad isolated two [[opossum]] populations, one from the [[predator]]-infested mainland and one from the predator-absent nearby island of [[Sapelo]]. According to the disposable soma theory, a [[Genetic isolate|genetically isolated]] population subject to low environmentally-induced mortality would evolve delayed reproduction and aging. This is because without the pressure of predation, it would be evolutionarily advantageous to allocate more resources to somatic maintenance than reproduction, as early offspring mortality would be low. As predicted, even after controlling for predation, the isolated population had a longer lifespan, delayed primiparity, and reduced aging biomarkers such as tail [[collagen]] [[Cross linking|cross-linking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Austad, SN| year = 1993| title =Retarded senescence in an insular population of Virginia opossums (''Didelphis virginiana'')| journal = Journal of Zoology| volume = 229| issue = 4 | pages = 695–708 | doi= 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1993.tb02665.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Human models ====

In general, only a few studies exist in human models. It was found that [[Eunuch|castrated men]] live longer than their [[fertile]] counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hamilton JB, Mestler GE| year = 1969| title =Mortality and survival: comparison of eunuchs with intact men and women in a mentally retarded population)| journal = J. Gerontol.| volume = 24| issue = 4 | pages = 395–411 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies found that in British women, primiparity was earliest in women who died early and latest in women who died at the oldest ages. Furthermore, increased number of children birthed was associated with a decreased lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Westendorp RG, Kirkwood TB| year = 1998| title =Human longevity at the cost of reproductive success |journal = Nature| volume = 396| issue = 6713 | pages = 743–746 | doi= 10.1038/25519}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final study found that female centenarians were more likely to have children in later life compared average, especially past the age of 40. The researchers discovered that 19.2% of female centenarians had their first child after the age of 40, compared to 5.5% of the rest of the female population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Perls TT, Alpert L, Fretts RC| year = 1997| title =Middle-aged mothers live longer |journal = Nature| volume = 389| issue = 6647 | pages = 133 | doi= 10.1038/38148| bibcode = 1997Natur.389..133P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship between cell damage and aging===
{{main|Free radical theory}}{{main|DNA damage theory of aging}}
[[File:Naked Mole Rat Eating.jpg|thumb|The [[naked mole rat]] has a [[naked mole rat#Longevity|disproportionately long life of 30 years]] through efficient cellular repair mechanisms.]]
There are numerous studies that support cellular damage, often due to a lack of somatic maintenance mechanisms, as a primary determinant for aging, and these studies have given rise to the [[free radical theory of aging]] and the [[DNA damage theory of aging]]. One study found that the cells of short-living rodents ''[[in vitro]]'' show much greater [[mutation]] rates and a general lack of genome surveillance compared to human cells and are far more susceptible to [[oxidative stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Lorenzini A, Stamato T, Sell C. | year = 2011| title = The disposable soma theory revisited: time as a resource in the theories of aging | journal = Cell Cycle| volume = 10 | issue = 22 | pages = 3853–3856 | doi=10.4161/cc.10.22.18302}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Other studies have been conducted on the [[naked mole rat]], a rodent species with remarkable longevity (30 years), capable of outliving the [[brown rat]] (3 years) by [[Fold (higher-order function)|ten-fold]]. Additionally, almost no incidence cancer has ever been detected in naked mole rats. Nearly all of the differences found between these two organisms, which are otherwise rather genetically similar, was in somatic maintenance. Naked mole rats were found to have higher levels of [[superoxide dismutase]], a [[reactive oxygen species]] clearing [[antioxidant]]. In addition, naked mole rats had higher levels of [[base excision repair]], DNA damage response signaling, [[Homologous recombination|homologous recombination repair]], [[mismatch repair]], [[nucleotide excision repair]], and [[non-homologous end joining]]. In fact, many of these processes were near or exceeded human levels. Proteins from naked mole rats were also more resistant to [[oxidation]], [[misfolding]], [[ubiquitination]], and had increased [[Translation|translational fidelity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Azpurua J, Ke Z, Chen IX, Zhang Q, Ermolenko DN; et al. | year = 2013| title = Naked mole-rat has increased translational fidelity compared with the mouse, as well as a unique 28S ribosomal RNA cleavage | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A| volume = 110 | issue = 43 | pages =17350–17355 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1313473110| bibcode =2013PNAS..11017350A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further studies have been conducted on patients with [[Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome]] (HGPS), a condition that leads to premature aging. Patients with HGPS typically age about seven times faster than average and usually succumb to the disease in their early teens. Patients with HGPS have cellular defects, specifically in the [[Lamin A protein|lamin proteins]], which regulate the organization of the [[Nuclear lamina|lamina]] and [[nuclear envelope]] for [[mitosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Pollex RL1, Hegele RA | year = 2004| title = Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome | journal = Clin. Genet.| volume = 66| issue = 5 | pages =375–381 | doi=10.1111/j.1399-0004.2004.00315.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Lastly, as mentioned previously, it has been found that the suppression of autophagy is associated with reduced lifespan, while stimulation is associated with extended lifespan. Activated in times of [[caloric restriction]], autophagy is a process that prevents cellular damage through clearance and [[recycling]] of damaged proteins and [[organelles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Glick D1, Barth S, Macleod KF. | year = 2010| title = Autophagy: cellular and molecular mechanisms| journal = J. Pathol. | volume = 221 | issue = 1 | pages =3–12| doi=10.1002/path.2697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism==
One of the main weaknesses of the disposable soma theory is that it does not postulate any specific cellular mechanisms to which an organism shifts energy to somatic repair over reproduction. Instead, it only offers an [[Evolution|evolutionary perspective]] on why aging may occur due to reproduction. Therefore, parts of it are rather limited outside of the field of [[evolutionary biology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

===Caloric restriction===
{{main|Calorie restriction#Sirtuin-mediated mechanism}}
[[File:Soma Disposable.png|thumb|Schematic showing the reallocation of energy investment towards [[DNA repair|self-repair]] during [[caloric restriction]].]]
Critics have pointed out the supposed [[Inconsistency|inconsistencies]] of the disposable soma theory due to the observed effects of caloric restriction, which is correlated with increased lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Blagosklonny, MV| year = 2010| title = Solving puzzles of aging: From disposable soma to signal-transduction pathways| journal = Russ J Gen Chem. | volume = 80 | issue = | pages =1407}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it activates autophagy, according to classical disposable soma principles, with less [[Caloric|caloric intake]], there would less total energy to be distributed towards somatic maintenance, and decreased lifespan would be observed (or at least the positive autophagic effects would be balanced out). However, Kirkwood, alongside his collaborator Darryl P. Shanley, assert that caloric restriction triggers an adaptive mechanism which causes the organism to shift a higher proportion of resources to somatic maintenance, away from reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Shanley DP, Kirkwood TB.| year = 2000| title = Calorie restriction and aging: a life-history analysis.| journal = Evolution | volume = 54 | issue =3 | pages =1407}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is supported by multiple studies, which show that caloric restriction typically results in [[Sterility (physiology)|impaired fertility]], but leave an otherwise healthy organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Holliday R.| year = 2000| title = Food, reproduction and longevity: is the extended lifespan of calorie-restricted animals an evolutionary adaptation?| journal = BioEssays | volume = 10 | issue =4 | pages =125–127|doi=10.1002/bies.950100408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Masoro EJ, Austad SN.| year = 1996| title = The evolution of the antiaging action of dietary restriction: a hypothesis.| journal = J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci | volume = 51 | issue =6 | pages =387–391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionarily, an organism would want to delay reproduction to when resources were more plentiful. During a resource-barren period, it would evolutionarily unwise to invest resources in progeny that would be unlikely to survive in [[famine]]. Mechanistically, the [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]]-dependent [[Deacetylate|deacetylase]] [[Sirtuin 1]] (SIRT-1) is upregulated during low-nutrient periods. SIRT-1 increases [[insulin sensitivity]], decreases the amount of [[inflammatory cytokine]]s, stimulates autophagy, and activates FOXO, the aforementioned protein involved in activating stress response genes. SIRT-1 is also found to result in decreased fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Cantó C, Auwerx J.| year = 2009| title = Caloric restriction, SIRT1 and longevity.| journal =Trends Endocrinol Metab| volume = 20 | issue =7 | pages =325–331|doi=10.1016/j.tem.2009.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In additional to differential [[wikt:partitioning|partitioning]] of energy allocation during caloric restriction, less caloric intake would result in less metabolic waste in the forms of [[free radicals]] like [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[superoxide]] and [[hydroxyl radicals]], which damage important cellular components, particularly [[mitochondria]]. Elevated levels of free radicals in mice has been correlated with neurodegeneration, [[Myocardial|myocardial injury]], [[Anemia|severe anemia]], and premature death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Pérez VI, Bokov A, Van Remmen H, Mele J; et al.| year = 2009| title = Is the oxidative stress theory of aging dead?| journal =Biochim Biophys Acta| volume = 1790 | issue =10 | pages =1005–1014|doi=10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Grandmother hypothesis===
{{main|Menopause#Evolutionary rationale}}
Another primary criticism of the disposable soma theory is that it fails to account for why women tend to live longer than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Ginter E, Simko V | year = 2013| title = Women live longer than men| journal = Bratisl Lek Listy.  | volume = 114 | issue = 2 | pages =45–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterall, females invest significantly more resources into reproduction and according to the classical disposable soma principles, this would compromise energy diverted to somatic maintenance. However, this can be reconciled with the [[grandmother hypothesis]]. The Grandmother Hypothesis states that [[menopause]] comes about into older women in order to restrict the time of reproduction as a protective mechanism. This would allow women to live longer and increase the amount of care they could provide to their [[grandchildren]], increasing their evolutionary fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hawkes K | year = 2003| title = Grandmothers and the evolution of human longevity| journal = Am. J. Hum. Biol.| volume =15 | issue =3  | pages =380–400| doi= 10.1002/ajhb.10156}}&lt;/ref&gt; And so, although women do invest a greater proportion of resources into reproduction during their [[Age and female fertility|fertile years]], their overall reproductive period is significantly shorter than men, who are able of reproduction during and even beyond [[middle age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Vinicius L, Mace R, Migliano A| year = 2014| title = Variation in Male Reproductive Longevity across Traditional Societies| journal = PLoS One| volume =9 | issue =11  | pages =e112236| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0112236| bibcode =2014PLoSO...9k2236V}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, males invest more resources into growth, and have significantly higher levels of IGF-1 compared to females, which is correlated with decreased lifespan. Other variables such as increased [[Testosterone|testosterone levels]] in males are not accounted for. Increased testosterone is often associated with reckless behaviour, which may lead to a high accidental death rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Celec P, Ostatníková D, Hodosy J. | year = 2015| title = On the effects of testosterone on brain behavioral functions| journal = Front. Neurosci.| volume =9 | issue =  | pages =12| doi=10.3389/fnins.2015.00012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contradicting models === 
A few [[Contradiction|contradicting]] animal models weaken the validity of the disposable soma theory. This includes studies done on the aforementioned naked mole rats. In these studies, it was found that reproductive naked mole rats actually show significantly increased lifespans compared to non-reproductive individuals, which contradicts the principles of diposable soma. However, although these naked mole rats are [[mammalian]], they are highly [[atypical]] in terms of aging studies and may not serve as the best model for humans. For example, naked mole rats have a disproportionately high longevity quotient and live in [[Eusociality|eusocial societies]], where breeding is usually designated to a [[Eusociality#In mammals|queen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Dammann P, Burda H | year = 2006| title =Sexual activity and reproduction delay ageing in a mammal.| journal = Curr. Biol.| volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 117–118 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.02.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex biases and environment ===
The disposable soma theory is tested disproportionately on female organisms for the relationship between reproduction and aging, as [[Parental investment#Females as the more investing sex|females carry a greater burden in reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hammers M, Richardson DS, Burke T, Komdeur J. | year = 2013| title = The impact of reproductive investment and early-life environmental conditions on senescence: support for the disposable soma hypothesis.| journal = J Evol Biol | volume = 26| issue = 9 | pages = 1999–2007| doi=10.1111/jeb.12204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, for the relationship between growth and aging, studies are disproportionately conducted on males, to minimize the [[Estrogen|hormonal fluctuations]] that occur with [[Menstrual cycle|menstrual cycling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Wu JJ, Liu J, Chen EB, Wang JJ; et al. | year = 2013| title = Increased mammalian lifespan and a segmental and tissue-specific slowing of aging after genetic reduction of mTOR expression| journal = Cell Rep. | volume = 4| issue = 5 | pages = 913–920| doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2013.07.030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, [[aging#Biological basis|genetic]] and [[Gene–environment interaction|environmental factors]], rather than reproductive patterns, may explain the variations in human lifespan. For example, studies have shown that [[Poverty|poorer individuals]], to whom nutritious food and [[medical care]] is less accessible, typically have higher birth rates and earlier primiparity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Murray, S. | year = 2006| title = Poverty and health| journal = CMAJ | volume = 174| issue = 7 | pages = 923| doi=10.1503/cmaj.060235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;According to Frings and Frings, this is: Margarette W. Brooks, "Influence of temperature on the chirp of the cricket", ''Popular Science Monthly'' 20 (1881), p. 268; citing "W.G.B.", a writer whom Brooks does not further identify. &lt;!-- However, this report does not seem to appear anywhere within vol 20 of this magazine; see https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_20 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; although this paper went unnoticed until after Dolbear's publication.&lt;ref name=frings62/&gt;

Dolbear did not specify the species of cricket which he observed, although subsequent researchers assumed it to be the snowy tree cricket, "''Oecanthus niveus''."&lt;ref name=frings57&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frings |first1=Hubert |last2=Frings |first2=Mable |year=1957 |title=The effects of temperature on chirp-rate of male cone-headed grasshoppers, Neoconocephalus ensiger |journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology |volume=134 |issue=3 |pages=411–425 |doi=10.1002/jez.1401340302 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jez.1401340302/abstract |accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=frings62&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frings |first1=Hubert |last2=Frings |first2=Mable |year=1962 |title=Effects of temperature on the ordinary song of the common meadow grasshopper, Orchelimum vulgare (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) |journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology |volume=151 |issue=1 |pages=33–51 |doi=10.1002/jez.1401510104 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jez.1401510104/abstract |accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Yes, this really is "Mable", not "Mabel". --&gt;  However, the snowy tree cricket was misidentified as ''O. niveus'' in early reports and the correct scientific name for this species is ''[[Oecanthus fultoni]]''.&lt;ref name=walker62&gt; {{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=Thomas J. |year=1962 |title=The Taxonomy and Calling Songs of United States Tree Crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae: Oecaiithinae).

The chirping of the more common [[field cricket]]s is not as reliably correlated to temperature—their chirping rate varies depending on other factors such as age and mating success. In many cases, though, the Dolbear's formula is a close enough approximation for field crickets, too.

Dolbear expressed the relationship as the following formula which provides a way to estimate the temperature ''T&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;'' in degrees Fahrenheit from the number of chirps per minute ''N&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;'':

&lt;math&gt;T_F = 50 + \left ( \frac{N_{60}-40}{4} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is accurate to within a degree or so when applied to the chirping of the [[field cricket]].

Counting can be sped up by simplifying the formula and counting the number of chirps produced in 15 seconds (''&lt;math&gt;N_{15}&lt;/math&gt;''):

&lt;math&gt;\,T_F = 40 + N_{15}&lt;/math&gt;

Reformulated to give the temperature in degrees Celsius (°C), it is:

&lt;math&gt;T_C = 10 + \left ( \frac{N_{60}-40}{7} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

A shortcut method for degrees Celsius is to count the number of chirps in 8 seconds (''&lt;math&gt;N_{8}&lt;/math&gt;'') and add 5 (This is fairly accurate between 5 and 30°C):

&lt;math&gt;\,T_C = 5 + N_{8}&lt;/math&gt;

The above formulae are expressed in terms of integers to make them easier to remember—they are not intended to be exact.

==In popular culture==
This formula was referenced in an episode (Season 3, Episode 2, "[[The Jiminy Conjecture]]") of the American TV sitcom ''[[List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#The Jiminy Conjecture|The Big Bang Theory]]'' (although Sheldon referred to Amos Dolbear as Emile Dolbear and gave the year of publication as 1890).
It is also referenced in two episodes ("[[Highs and Lows (QI episode)|Highs and Lows]]", "[[Jungles (QI episode)|Jungles]]") of the British comedy show [[QI]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13585">"'''Drinking the Kool-Aid'''" is an expression commonly used in the United States that refers to a person who believes in a possibly doomed or dangerous idea because of perceived potential high rewards.  The phrase often carries a negative connotation.  It can also be used ironically or humorously to refer to accepting an idea or changing a preference due to popularity, peer pressure, or persuasion.  In recent years it has evolved further to mean extreme dedication to a cause or purpose, so extreme that one would "Drink the Kool-Aid" and die for the cause.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

==Background==
{{main|Jonestown#Deaths in Jonestown}}
On November 18, 1978, Jones ordered that the members of [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Leo Ryan]]'s party be killed after several defectors chose to leave with the party. Residents of the commune later committed suicide by drinking a flavored beverage laced with [[potassium cyanide]]; some were forced to drink it, some (such as small children) drank it unknowingly.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly 918 people died.

Descriptions of the event often refer to the beverage not as [[Kool-Aid]] but as Flavor Aid,&lt;ref name="Zorn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2008/11/have-you-drunk-the-kool-aid-kool-aid.html|title=''Change of Subject,'' "Have you drunk the 'Kool Aid' Kool Aid |accessdate=2009-08-27 |author=Eric Zorn |date=2008-11-18 |publisher=Chicago Tribune, www.chicagotribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a less-expensive product reportedly found at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Charles A. |last=Krause |title=Jonestown Is an Eerie Ghost Town Now |newspaper=Washington Post|date=Dec 17, 1978|quote=Along the muddy path that served as a sidewalk for much of the commune, other reminders of the life and death that were Jonestown lie half buried in the fertile soil.

Others are less categorical.&lt;ref name="Zorn"/&gt; Both brands are known to have been among the commune's supplies: Film footage shot inside the compound prior to the events of November shows Jones opening a large chest in which boxes of both Flavor Aid and Kool-Aid are visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= Nelson, Stanley|year= 2006|title= Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZjfWuTHe0M&amp;feature=fvsr#t=9m51s |format= |medium= DVD|language= |trans_title= |publisher= PBS Home Video|location= Hollywood, California|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal investigators testifying at the Jonestown inquest spoke of finding packets of  "cool aid" (''[[sic]]''), and eyewitnesses to the incident are also recorded as speaking of "cool aid" or "Cool Aid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/GuyanaInquest.pdf |title=Guyana inquest |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether they intended to refer to the actual Kool-Aid–brand drink or were [[Genericized trademark|using the name in a generic sense]] that might refer to any powdered flavored beverage.

Given that both were available and are functionally very similar, it is hard to distinguish whether just one or both brands were used. The group had engaged in many "dry runs" using unpoisoned drink.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Utopian nightmare.

In December 1978, Rev.

According to academician Rebecca Moore, early analogies to Jonestown and Kool-Aid were based around death and suicide, not blind obedience.&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;[http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=16584 Drinking the Kool-Aid: The Cultural Transformation of a Tragedy], Rebecca Moore, American Academy of Religion/ Western Region, St. Mary’s College of California, 26 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest such example she found, via a [[Lexis-Nexis]] search, was a 1982 statement from [[Lane Kirkland]], then head of the [[AFL-CIO]], which described [[Ronald Reagan]]'s policies as "Jonestown economics," which "administers Kool-Aid to the poor, the deprived and the unemployed."&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt;

In 1984, a Reagan administration appointee, Clarence M. Pendleton Jr., chairman of the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]], was quoted as criticizing civil rights leaders [[Jesse Jackson]], [[Vernon Jordan Jr.]], and [[Benjamin Hooks]] by making an analogy between allegiance to "the black leadership" and blind obedience to the Jonestown leaders: "We refuse to be led into another political Jonestown as we were led during the Presidential campaign. No more Kool-Aid, Jesse, Vernon and Ben. We want to be free."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/20/us/criticism-of-black-leaders.html |title=Criticism of Black Leaders |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 20, 1984 |accessdate=March 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Jack Solerwitz, a lawyer for many of the air traffic controllers who lost their jobs in the 1981 [[Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (1968)|PATCO]] strike, explained his dedication to their cause in spite of the substantial personal financial losses he incurred by saying: "I was the only lawyer who kept the doors open for them, and I thought I'd get a medal for it... Instead, I was the one who drank the Kool-Aid."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/20/us/law-bar-lawyer-for-striking-air-traffic-controllers-won-back-60-jobs-but.html |title=LAW: AT THE BAR; Lawyer for striking air traffic controllers won back 60 jobs but suffered personal loss |first=David |last=Margolick |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 20, 1989 |accessdate=March 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread use of the phrase with its current meaning may have begun in the late 1990s. In some cases it began to take on a neutral or even positive light, implying simply great enthusiasm. In 1998, the dictionary website logophilia.com defined the phrase thus: "To become a firm believer in something; to accept an argument or philosophy whole-heartedly."&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt;

The phrase has been used in the business and technology worlds to mean fervent devotion to a certain company or technology. A 2000 ''[[The New York Times]]'' article about the end of the [[dot-com bubble]] noted, "The saying around San Francisco Web shops these days, as companies run out of money, is 'Just keep drinking the Kool-Aid,' a tasteless reference to the Jonestown massacre."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/29/opinion/the-shadow-in-silicon-valley.html |title=The Shadow in Silicon Valley |first=Rodes |last=Fishburne |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 29, 2000 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase or metaphor has also often been used in a political context, usually with a negative implication. In 2002, [[Arianna Huffington]] used the phrase "pass the Kool-Aid, pardner" in a column about an economic forum hosted by President [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/col/huff/2002/08/16/waco/index.html |title=Wacko in Waco |author=Arianna Huffington |publisher=Salon.com |date=August 16, 2002 |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, commentators [[Michelangelo Signorile]] and [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] have used the term to describe those whom they perceive as following certain ideologies blindly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/09/09/feeling-sorry-for-oreilly/ | work=Fox News | title=Feeling Sorry for O'Reilly | date=2005-09-09|accessdate=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 speech, ''[[Newsweek]]'' editor [[Jon Meacham]] stressed his political independence by saying, "I did not drink the [[Barack Obama|Obama]] Kool-Aid last year."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/2009/apr/01/newsweek-editor-addresses-reagan-forum/ |title=Newsweek editor addresses Reagan Forum |first=Jake |last=Finch |newspaper=Ventura County Star |date=April 1, 2009 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, columnist [[Meghan Daum]] wrote that the phrase had become "one of the nation's most popular idiomatic trends," while bemoaning its rise in popularity, calling its usage "grotesque, even offensive." She cited, among others, usages by [[Starbucks]] CEO [[Howard Schultz]], who said that he "drank the Kool-Aid as much as anyone else about Obama," and ''[[Us Weekly]]'' magazine, which reported during the short marriage of [[Kim Kardashian]] and [[Kris Humphries]] that "Kris is not drinking the Kardashian Kool-Aid."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-daum-koolaid-20111117,0,347333.column |title=Don't 'drink the Kool-Aid' |first=Meghan |last=Daum |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=November 17, 2011 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, "Drinking the Kool-Aid" won first place in an online poll by ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' Magazine as "the single most annoying example of [[business jargon]]."&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Emmert experiment.jpg|thumb|Emmert's perceptual experiment]]
The '''Emmert experiment''' is a perceptual experiment by psychologist [[Emil Emmert]] (1844–1911). The experiment is based on the size constancy.

==Principles==
Besides localization and recognition, there is another function of our sensory system: the size of the objects remain constant in spite of the changes of the image perceived our retina. Thanks to evolution we experience the objects as they really are and not as our eyes perceives them. We usually perceive object as being relatively constant, irrespective of the light conditions, our point of view or the distance between the object and us.

Our cars do not seem to be bigger even if we are approaching them, their form do not become more distorted, their colour does not change even if we apply artificial lighting. This phenomenon is called perceptual constancy.

The most studied constancy is the size constancy, or the phenomenon as when we perceive the constant size of the objects independently to their distance. As an object moves farther away, their perceived size usually does not decrease as we are looking at them.

==Example==
Hold a coin in front of you, 30 centimeters away from you and then move it at arm’s length. Does the coin seem smaller? Obviously not, but the size of the retinal image of the coin is two times bigger than the retinal image of the coin when it was 30 centimeters  away.

In the Emmert experiment, we keep a book in front of us within normal reading distance, with good light conditions. Fixate our look into the middle of the object for 1 minute and look to a wall further away. We can see the post-images of the two circles that seem to be bigger than the stimulus. Now let’s look at a paper close to our eyes. The post-image is smaller than the stimulus. If the post-image disappears it can be restored by blinking.

==Biography==

Evan Roth received a degree in architecture from [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] and a MFA from the Communication, Design and Technology school at [[Parsons The New School for Design]], where he graduated as class valedictorian.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} During his time at Parsons, he developed several projects, including Graffiti Taxonomy, Typographic Illustration, Explicit Content Only and Graffiti Analysis, his thesis project. Roth was named one of the ten most interesting recent graduates of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;"Head of the Class", ''RES'', 9(2):52,56&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating Roth worked at the [[Eyebeam Atelier|Eyebeam]] OpenLab, an open source creative technology lab for the public domain as a Research and Development Fellow from 2005–2006 and a Senior Fellow from 2006-2007. Roth's work with graffiti, open source technology and public space led to him forming the [[Graffiti Research Lab]] ("GRL") with [[James Powderly]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;  GRL projects include [[LED Throwies]] and [[L.A.S.E.R. Tag]].  In 2007, Roth co-founded the [[Free Art and Technology Lab]] (F.A.T. Lab), an Internet-based art-and-technology collective dedicated to the intersection of open-source hacking and popular culture. He has worked under the pseudonym ''fi5e''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciarc.edu/lectures.php?id=1357&lt;/ref&gt;

Roth and Ben Engebreth were awarded a 2007 Rhizome Commission for White Glove Tracking, which was presented at the Contemporary New Museum in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whiteglovetracking.com whiteglovetracking.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhizome.org/commissions/2007/ Rhizome|2007 Commissions]&lt;/ref&gt;  Roth was again awarded a Rhizome Commission in 2008 for his project "T.S.A. Communications." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhizome.org/commissions/2009/ Rhizome|2009 Commissions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of Roth's work are in the permanent collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=33190&lt;/ref&gt; Roth currently{{when|date=April 2014}} lives in Paris with his wife.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7376">'''Fairtrade Fortnight''' is an annual promotional campaign which happens once every year, organized and funded by the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] to increase awareness of Fairtrade products. It makes use of volunteers who support the goals of Fairtrade but who may also be committed to the more general concepts of fair trade, ethical trading or concerned by development issues. The concept was pioneered by the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] in the [[United Kingdom]], initially held in 1997 in Scotland and directed by [[Barnaby Miln]].

The inaugural national launch was on 12 February 1997&lt;ref&gt;Herald, 13 February 1997, Retailing by Simon Bain&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Evening News, 14 February 1997, Shop around for fair trade by John Vidal&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Augustine United Church]] on [[Edinburgh]]'s George IV Bridge by Lady [[Marion Fraser]], chairman of the charity [[Christian Aid]]. She broke a bar of Fairtrade chocolate to launch the event. It turned out to be a highly successful campaign to get every supermarket throughout Scotland&lt;ref&gt;Life and Work magazine, March 1997, Pester power puts fairness into focus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Episcopalian, April 1997, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Aid News, April/June 1997, Pester power rules! page 12&lt;/ref&gt; to stock Fairtrade products. Barnaby Miln sent supporters of Christian Aid Scotland, [[SCIAF]], [[Traidcraft]], [[Oxfam]] and the [[World Development Movement]] a list of 85 supermarkets in Scotland's cities and larger towns, and encouraged during the Fortnight to go and ask for Fairtrade products.

'''Fairtrade Fortnight''' spread to the rest of the United Kingdom the following year; today, Fairtrade Fortnights are celebrated in several countries, most notably [[Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Awareness raising and promotion of [[Fairtrade labelling|Fairtrade certified products]] to the public are the main objectives of the Fortnight.

Usually events held during the fortnight include:
* Fetes
* Fairs
* [[Fairtrade]] food and drink tastings,
* Fashion shows
* Community, school, college and university events

These events are often supported by local authorities and governments, Fairtrade Steering Groups, dozens of [[charities]] and [[Alternative trading organization|ATOs]], all seeking to ensure that the local populace purchase fair and ethically traded goods. Local schools and colleges where Fairtrade is a frequently discussed topic can also play significant roles during Fairtrade Fortnight.

Events are highlighted and recorded on various nations' Fairtrade licensing bodies' websites (e.g. the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] in the UK or [[Fairtrade Canada]]). Most media outlets are keen to support a fast-growing trend in which previously disadvantaged third world producers have a fairer market to sell their wares and develop their economic capabilities.

'''In 2018 Fairtrade Fortnight is celebrated from 28 February to 11 March.'''

==Criticism of Fairtrade==
{{Main|Fair trade debate}}

Critics in the [[Fair trade debate]] claim that some volunteers can have an incorrect view of Fairtrade, because the information is concealed from them,&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, P. (2012),  “Ethical Objections to Fairtrade”, Journal of Business Ethics (2012) 105:357–373 DOI 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm, Accessed 2 February 2012; Mohan, S. (2010). Fair Trade Without the Froth - a dispassionate economic analysis of 'Fair Trade'. London: Institute of Economic Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular that the evidence that little or none of the extra amount paid by consumers always reaches the producers,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics July 2011(DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm; Valkila, J., Haaparanta, P., &amp; Niemi, N. (2010). “Empowering Coffee Traders? The Coffee Value Chain from Nicaraguan Fair Trade Farmers to Finnish Consumers.” Journal of Business Ethics , 97:257-270.

Harford, T. (2005), The Undercover Economist, Oxford: Oxford University Press.;

Howley, K. (2006), ‘Absolution in your cup’, Reason, http:// www.reason.com, March.;
Nicholls, A. and C. Opal (2005), Fair Trade: Market-Driven Ethical Consumption, London: Sage.;
Sellers, F. S. (2005), ‘Gift-wrapped guilt?’, Washington Post, 18 December.;
&lt;/ref&gt; and an alleged lack of evidence that Fairtrade has a positive impact on Third World producers.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics July 2011(DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm; Mohan, S. (2010). Fair Trade Without the Froth - a dispassionate economic analysis of 'Fair Trade'. London: Institute of Economic Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument is now largely obsolete as FLO-CERT, the Fairtrade Foundation and other nations' representative organisations and overseas development agencies continue to publish commodity reports and market analyses clearly indicating the benefits of the Fairtrade certification scheme over standard free market trade.

Using volunteers who allegedly do not understand the facts has in the past been criticised by Messrs. Davies and Crane&lt;ref&gt;Davies, I.A. and A Crane, ‘Andrew Crane Ethical Decision Making in Fair Trade Companies’, Journal of Business Ethics 45: 79–92, 2003. P84&lt;/ref&gt; in their report that The Day Chocolate Company, "made considerable use of unpaid volunteer workers for routine tasks, many of whom seemed to be under the (false) impression that they were helping out a charity. Not only might one question the sometimes quite excessive use of unpaid labour in a for-profit organisation, but the management team at Day appeared to have no intention of correcting the obvious misapprehensions of the volunteers. However, this did not appear to be acknowledged as a potential ethical problem at Day."

Fairtrade International and The Fairtrade Foundation produce a significant volume of information and resources for volunteers and interested people who wish to learn more about all aspects of the Fairtrade framework, in addition to more in-depth commodity reports and market analyses across all commodity sectors where it licenses products.

'''Freedom''', generally, is having an ability to act or change without constraint. A thing is "free" if it can change its state easily and is not constrained in its present state. In philosophy and religion, it is associated with having [[free will]] and being without undue or unjust constraints, or [[slavery|enslavement]], and is an idea closely related to the concept of [[liberty]]. A person has the freedom to do things that will not, in theory or in practice, be prevented by other forces. Outside of the human realm, freedom generally does not have this political or psychological dimension. A rusty lock might be oiled so that the key has freedom to turn, undergrowth may be hacked away to give a newly planted sapling freedom to grow, or a mathematician may study an equation having many degrees of freedom. In mechanical engineering, "freedom" describes the number of independent motions that are allowed to a body or system, which is generally referred to as [[degrees of freedom]]."

==Free will==
{{Main|Free will}}
In philosophical discourse, freedom is discussed in the context of [[free will]] and self-determination, balanced by [[moral responsibility]].

Advocates of free will regard freedom of thought as innate to the human mind, while opponents regard the mind as thinking only the thoughts that a purely deterministic brain happens to be engaged in at the time.

==Social freedom or liberty==
[[File:OURS TO FIGHT FOR. 4 FREEDOMS ON ONE SHEET - NARA - 513635.jpg|thumb|right|[[Four Freedoms]], a series of paintings meant to describe the freedoms for which allied nations fought in World War II.]]
{{Main|Political freedom|Liberty}}
In political discourse, [[political freedom]] is often associated with [[liberty]] and [[autonomy]] in the sense of "giving oneself one's own laws", and with having [[rights]] and the [[civil liberties]] with which to exercise them without undue interference by the state. Frequently discussed kinds of political freedom include [[freedom of assembly]], [[freedom of association]], [[freedom of choice]], and [[freedom of speech]].

In some circumstances, particularly when discussion is limited to political freedoms, the terms "freedom" and "liberty" tend to be used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Bertrand Badie, Dirk Berg-Schlosser, Leonardo Morlino, ''International Encyclopedia of Political Science'' (2011), p. 1447: "Throughout this entry, incidentally, the terms freedom and liberty are used interchangeably".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wierzbicka"&gt;Anna Wierzbicka, ''Understanding Cultures Through Their Key Words'' (1997), p. 130-31: "Unfortunately... the English words freedom and liberty are used interchangeably. This is confusing because these two do not mean the same, and in fact what [Isaiah] Berlin calls "the notion of 'negative' freedom" has become largely incorporated in the word ''freedom'', whereas the word ''liberty'' in its earlier meaning was much closer to the Latin libertas and in its current meaning reflects a different concept, which is a product of the Anglo-Saxon culture".&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, however, subtle distinctions between freedom and liberty have been noted.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, ''Control and Freedom: Power and Paranoia in the Age of Fiber Optics'' (2008), p. 9: "Although used interchangeably, freedom and liberty have significantly different etymologies and histories. According to the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', the Old English ''frei'' (derived from Sanskrit) meant dear and described all those close or related to the head of the family (hence friends). Conversely in Latin, ''libertas'' denoted the legal state of being free versus enslaved and was later extended to children (''liberi''), meaning literally the free members of the household. Those who are one's friends are free; those who are not are slaves".&lt;/ref&gt; [[John&amp;nbsp;Stuart&amp;nbsp;Mill]], differentiated liberty from freedom in that freedom is primarily, if not exclusively, the ability to do as one wills and what one has the power to do; whereas liberty concerns the absence of arbitrary restraints and takes into account the rights of all involved. As such, the exercise of liberty is subject to capability and limited by the rights of others.&lt;ref name=mill1&gt;Mill, J.S. (1869)., "Chapter I: Introductory", ''On Liberty''. http://www.bartleby.com/130/1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Wendy Hui Kyong Chun explains the differences in terms of their relation to institutions:

{{quote|''Liberty is linked to human subjectivity; freedom is not. The Declaration of Independence, for example, describes men as having liberty and the nation as being free. Free will—''the quality of being free from the control of fate or necessity''—may first have been attributed to human will, but [[Newtonian physics]] attributes freedom—[[degrees of freedom]], [[free bodies]]—to objects.''&lt;ref name="Chun"&gt;Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, ''Control and Freedom: Power and Paranoia in the Age of Fiber Optics'' (2008), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|''Freedom differs from liberty as control differs from discipline. Liberty, like discipline, is linked to institutions and political parties, whether liberal or libertarian; freedom is not. Although freedom can work for or against institutions, it is not bound to them—it travels through unofficial networks. To have liberty is to be liberated from something; to be free is to be self-determining, autonomous. Freedom can or cannot exist within a state of liberty: one can be liberated yet ''unfree,'' or ''free'' yet enslaved (Orlando Patterson has argued in ''Freedom: Freedom in the Making of Western Culture'' that freedom arose from the yearnings of slaves).''&lt;ref name="Chun"/&gt;}}

Another distinction that some political theorists have deemed important is that people may aspire to have freedom ''from'' limiting forces (such as [[freedom from fear]], [[freedom from want]], and [[freedom from discrimination]]), but descriptions of freedom and liberty generally do not invoke having liberty ''from'' anything.&lt;ref name="Wierzbicka"/&gt; To the contrary, the concept of [[negative liberty]] refers to the liberty one person may have to restrict the rights of others.&lt;ref name="Wierzbicka"/&gt;

Other important fields in which freedom is an issue include [[economic freedom]], [[academic freedom]], [[intellectual freedom]], and [[scientific freedom]].

==Freedom as a physical concept==
In purely physical terms, freedom is used much more broadly to describe the limits to which physical movement or other physical processes are possible. This relates to the philosophical concept to the extent that people may be considered to have as much freedom as they are physically able to exercise. The number of independent [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] or parameters for a system is described as its number of [[degrees of freedom]]. For example the movement of a vehicle along a road has two degrees of freedom; to go fast or slow, or to change direction by turning left or right. The movement of a ship sailing on the waves has four degrees of freedom, since it can also pitch nose-to-tail and roll side-to-side. An aeroplane can also climb and sideslip, giving it [[six degrees of freedom]].

[[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|Degrees of freedom in mechanics]] describes the number of independent motions that are allowed to a body, or, in case of a [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]] made of several bodies, the number of possible independent relative motions between the pieces of the mechanism. In the study of complex [[motor control]], there may be so many degrees of freedom that a given action can be achieved in different ways by combining movements with different degrees of freedom. This issue is sometimes called the [[degrees of freedom problem]].

==Freedom in mathematical theory==
In [[mathematics]] freedom is the ability of a [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] to change in value.

Some equations have many such variables. This notion is formalized as the [[dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimension]] of a [[manifold]] or an [[algebraic variety]]. When ''degrees of freedom'' is used instead of ''dimension'', this usually means that the manifold or variety that models the system is only implicitly defined. Such degrees of freedom appear in many mathematical and related disciplines, including [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] as used in [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] to explain dependence on [[parameter]]s, or the [[dimensions]] of a [[phase space]]; and [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom in statistics]], the number of values in the final calculation of a [[statistic]] that are free to vary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15037">The '''generation effect''' is a phenomenon where information is better [[memory|remembered]] if it is generated from one's own mind rather than simply [[reading (process)|read]].&lt;ref name="jacoby"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jacoby |first= L.L. |year=1978 |title=On interpreting the effects of repetition: Solving a problem versus remembering a solution |journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=649–668 |doi= 10.1016/S0022-5371(78)90393-6 |url=http://psych.wustl.edu/amcclab/Manuscripts/Jacoby/Jacoby%20(1978)/Retention%20Effects%20of%20Solving%20vs.%20Remembering.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have struggled to account for why generated information is better recalled than read information, but no single explanation has been sufficient.

==In experiments==
The generation effect is typically achieved in [[cognitive psychology]] experiments by asking participants to generate words from word fragments.&lt;ref name=crutcher&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crutcher |first=R.J. |author2=Healy, A.F. |year=1989 |title=Cognitive operations and the generation effect |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=669–675  |doi=10.1037/0278-7393.15.4.669}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect has also been demonstrated using a variety of other materials, such as when generating a word after being presented with its [[antonym]]&lt;ref name="mulligan" /&gt; or [[synonym]],&lt;ref name="jacoby"/&gt; generating keywords in paragraphs,&lt;ref name="dewinstanley"&gt;{{cite journal |last=deWinstanley |first=P.A. |author2=Bjork, E.L. |year=2004 |title=Processing strategies and the generation effect: Implications for making a better reader |journal=Memory &amp; Cognition |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=945–955|doi=10.3758/BF03196872}}&lt;/ref&gt; pictures,&lt;ref name=kinjo&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kinjo |first= H. |author2=Snodgrass, J.G. |year=2000 |title=Does the generation effect occur for pictures? |journal=The American Journal of Psychology |volume=113 |issue=1 |pages=95–121 |doi=10.2307/1423462|pmid=10742845 |jstor=1423462}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arithmetic problems.&lt;ref name="crutcher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcnamara"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McNamara |first=D.S. |author2=Healy, A.F. |year=2000 |title=A procedural explanation of the generation effect for simple and difficult multiplication problems and answers |journal=Journal of Memory and Language |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=652–679  |doi=10.1006/jmla.2000.2720 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the generation effect has been found in studies using [[free recall]], [[cued recall]], and recognition tests.&lt;ref name="mulligan"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mulligan |first=N.W. |year=2001 |title=Generation and hypermnesia |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=436–450|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.27.2.436}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, the subject was provided with a stimulus word, the first letter of the response, and a word relating the two. For example, with the rule of opposite, the stimulus word "hot", and the letter "c", the word cold would be generated. This methodology has since been used in the majority of experiments investigating the generation effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport|last=McNamara|first=Danielle|title=The Generation Effect: A Detailed Analysis of the Role of Semantic Processing|url=http://ics.colorado.edu/techpubs/pdf/92-02.pdf|publisher=Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Colorado|id=92-02|date=1992|citeseerx=10.1.1.20.3266|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818140359/http://ics.colorado.edu/techpubs/pdf/92-02.pdf|archivedate=2007-08-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

===Lexical activation hypothesis===
According to the lexical activation hypothesis, the participant must search his or her [[semantic memory]] during the process of generation. The search activates [[semantic]] features in memory that are related to the target item. During the retrieval of the target item at testing, the semantic features serve as retrieval cues and aid in the recall of the target item.&lt;ref name="crutcher"/&gt; One study done by Payne, Neely, and Burns further tested this hypothesis. Their research question was: will the generation effect occur for words only or also [[non-word]]s? To test this they studied 168 Purdue undergraduate students. The researchers divided the participants up into two groups. The first group had word or non word pairs that rhymed and were told to read both out loud. The second group had a word or non word and the first letter of the next followed by blanks, and were told to read the first word out loud and generate a word that rhymed with the first word and started with the letter presented. The results were as expected. Participants were only generating words rather than non words according to the lexical activation hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Payne|first=David |author2=James Neely |author3=Daniel Burns|title=The Generation Effect: Further Tests of the Lexical Activation Hypothesis|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|date= 1986|volume=14|issue=3 |pages=246–252|doi=10.3758/BF03197700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procedural account===
The procedural account, which builds upon the lexical activation hypothesis, argues that people are more likely to engage in particular [[cognitive]] procedures during the encoding of items when generating than when reading. The process of generation induces people to connect the item to information in memory (unlike the lexical activation hypothesis, the information in memory does not necessarily reside in the [[lexicon]]). The generation effect occurs if the procedures used during encoding are reinstated during the memory test.&lt;ref name="mcnamara"/&gt; Procedural account is also linked to transfer-appropriate processing in that they both cause or do not cause the generation effect depending on encoding and retrieval processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeWinstanley|first=Patricia|author2=Elizabeth Bjork|title=Processing Strategies and the Generation Effect: Implications for Making a Better Reader|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|year=2004|volume=32|issue=6|pages=945–955|doi=10.3758/BF03196872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multifactor transfer-appropriate processing account===
According to the multifactor transfer-appropriate processing account, the generation task forces participants to focus their processing on the type of information needed to solve the generation task. When a later test is sensitive to the same type of information, a generation effect occurs. However, when there is not a match between the type of information processed to solve the generation task and the type of information needed to do well on a later test, the generation effect does not occur.&lt;ref name="deWinstanley2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=deWinstanley |first=P.A. |author2=Bjork, E.L. |author3=Bjork, R.A. |year=1996 |title =Generation effects and the lack thereof: The role of transfer-appropriate processing |journal=Memory |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=31–48  |doi=10.1080/741940667 |pmid=8821084}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a participant that is required to generate same-category targets from distinctive semantic cues (e.g., PURR-C_T, SADDLE-H_RS_) is likely to notice similarities between the targets (e.g., they are all animals). This type of manipulation would promote whole-list relational processing, which may enhance generation performance on a free recall test. Other manipulations can emphasise cue-target processing, thus helping generation performance on cued recall tests.&lt;ref name="mcdaniel"&gt;{{cite journal |year=1988 |title=A contextual account of the generation effect: A three-factor theory |journal=Journal of Memory and Language |volume=27 |pages=521–536 |doi=10.1016/0749-596X(88)90023-X |issue=5|last1=McDaniel |first1=Mark A |last2=Waddill |first2=Paula J |last3=Einstein |first3=Gilles O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been found that the generation effect was invariable across the different types of memory encoding.
&lt;ref name=mcnamara /&gt;

==Limitations==
By manipulating materials or instructions, experimenters have reduced or eliminated the generation effect. This suggests that there are instances in which [[reading (process)|reading]] can have the same memorial gains as generating. For example, when participants are given instructions to process information in a manner that was similar to the processing performed by the participants in the generate condition, the generation advantage between the groups was eliminated.&lt;ref name="mcdaniel"/&gt; In another study, participants who used a processing strategy (imagery) that was more effective than reading performed just as well as those who generated.&lt;ref name="begg"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Begg |first=I. |author2=Vinski, E. |author3=Frankovich, L. |author4=Holgate, B.  |year=1991 |title=Generating makes words memorable, but so does effective reading |journal=Memory &amp; Cognition |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=487–497 |doi=10.3758/BF03199571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the generation effect is a robust finding, there are some studies that have found no memorial benefits of generating compared to reading. For example, one study did not find the generation effect when they used legal non-words and found a reduced generation effect when they used material unfamiliar to the participants. They concluded that generating may have limited effectiveness when applied to new or unfamiliar material. This warrants some concern because if the generation effect is to be incorporated into educational practices such as classroom teaching, we would want it to help students learn new material.&lt;ref name= "lutz"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lutz |first=John |author2=Briggs, A. |author3=Cain, K. |year=2003 |title=An examination of the value of the generation effect for learning new material |journal=The Journal of General Psychology |volume=130 |issue=2 |pages=171–188 |doi=10.1080/00221300309601283 |pmid=12773019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that the generation effect may cause a trade-off in encoding item information and associative information.&lt;ref name="mulligan2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mulligan |first=Neil W. |year=2004 |title=Generation and memory for contextual detail |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=838–855 |doi=10.1037/0278-7393.30.4.838 |pmid=15238028}}&lt;/ref&gt; The processing of item-specific features of the target item may be enhanced when generating, and generating may also enhance the processing of cue-target relation. But, encoding requires limited-capacity resources, so the better encoding of one type of information may occur at a cost to the encoding of other information.&lt;ref name=mulligan2/&gt;&lt;ref name="jurica"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jurica |first=P.J. |author2=Shimamura, A.P. |year=1999 |title=Monitoring item and source information: Evidence for a negative generation effect in source memory |journal=Memory &amp; Cognition |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=648–656 |doi=10.3758/BF03211558}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also has implications for applying generation to educational practices because even if generation improves the recall of specific words, the memory for the contextual information surrounding those words may suffer.

==Practical applications==
{{tone|section|date=June 2016}}
The generation effect appears promising as a strategy for learning, and particularly for remembering educational material. Currently, researchers at [[UCLA]] and [[UC Berkeley]] are investigating ways to incorporate learning strategies such as the generation effect, as well as other "desirable difficulties", into the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;http://iddeas.psych.ucla.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some ways that you could use generation to aid in [[memory retention]]. Here are some examples:
* Read a section of your book. Then, close the book and generate (and answer) questions about what you just read.
* If there are review questions at the end of a chapter, answer those questions without looking back at the pages.
* Use [[flashcards]] to test yourself.
* If you are an educator (or if you want to write a practice test for a friend), create tests that require fill-in-the-blank, short answer, or essay responses rather than [[multiple-choice]] responses.

==Exceptions==

There are several reports in the literature that suggest that individuals diagnosed with DAT (which stands for dementia of the Alzheimer type) do not show the generation effect. One study included 42 healthy adults, 23 with very mild DAT, and 26 with mild DAT. Researchers Kristi S. Multhaup and David A. Balota had participants  read  some  sentences  (e.g.,  "The  horse  jumped  the fence") and  generate  the  endings  to  other sentences  (e.g., "The  gentleman  opened  the  ").  Later, participants were  given the  subjects of the sentences  (e.g.,  "horse"; "gentleman")  and  asked to recall  the  object  that  had  been paired  with the  words in  the previous  sentences  (e.g., "fence";  "door").  Healthy older adults  showed  higher recall  for  words  that they  had  generated  compared  with 383 words  that  they  had  read  (i.e.,  a  significant  generation effect). In contrast, individuals diagnosed with DAT did not show a difference in recall for words that they had generated and words that they had read. Similarly, another study reported four experiments with the  same  group  of  18  DAT  individuals  and  found  little evidence  for  a  generation  effect  in  word  recall,  word recognition, or recall of action instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~dbalota/Generation%20effects%20and%20source%20memory%20Multhuap%20Balota.pdf|doi=10.1037/0894-4105.11.3.382|pmid=9223142|title=Generation effects and source memory in healthy older adults and in adults with dementia of the Alzheimer type|journal=Neuropsychology|volume=11|issue=3|pages=382–391|year=1997|last1=Multhaup|first1=Kristi S.|last2=Balota|first2=David A.|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614100324/http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~dbalota/Generation%20effects%20and%20source%20memory%20Multhuap%20Balota.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nonhuman animals==

There is some evidence that animals also display the generation effect during learning.&lt;ref name="kornell"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kornell |first=N. |author2=Terrace, H.S. |year=2007 |title=The Generation Effect in monkeys |journal=Psychological Science |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=682–685 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01959.x|pmid=17680937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent work challenges the idea animals display the generation effect.&lt;ref name="staniland"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Staniland |first=J. |author2=Colombo, M. |author3=Scarf, D.|year=2015 |title=The Generation Effect or Simply Generating an Effect? |journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology |volume=129 |issue=4 |pages=329–333 |doi=10.1037/a0039450|pmid=26147702 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Habitat fragmentation''' describes the emergence of discontinuities (fragmentation) in an organism's preferred [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] ([[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]), causing [[population fragmentation]] and  [[ecosystem decay]]. Causes of habitat fragmentation include [[geological]] processes that slowly alter the layout of the physical environment&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;

==Definition==
The term habitat fragmentation includes five discrete phenomena:
* Reduction in the total area of the habitat
* Decrease of the interior: [[edge effect|edge]] ratio
* Isolation of one habitat fragment from other areas of habitat
* Breaking up of one patch of habitat into several smaller patches
* Decrease in the average size of each patch of habitat

"fragmentation ... not only causes loss of the amount of habitat, but by creating small, isolated patches it also changes the properties of the remaining habitat" (van den Berg et al. 2001){{Failed verification|date=April 2018}}. Habitat fragmentation is the landscape level of the phenomenon, and patch level process. Thus meaning, it covers; the patch areas, edge effects, and patch shape complexity.&lt;ref&gt;van den Berg LJL, Bullock JM, Clarke RT, Langsten RHW, Rose RJ. 2001. Territory selection by the Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata) in Dorset, England: the role of vegetation type, habitat fragmentation and population size. Biol. Conserv. 101:217-28
&lt;/ref&gt;

In scientific literature, there is some debate whether the term "habitat fragmentation" applies in cases of habitat loss, or whether the term primarily applies to the phenomenon of habitat being cut into smaller pieces without significant reduction in habitat area. Scientists who use the stricter definition of "habitat fragmentation" per se&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; would refer to loss of habitat area as "habitat loss" and explicitly mention both terms if describing a situation where the habitat becomes less connected and there is less overall habitat.

== Causes ==

===Natural causes===
Evidence of [[habitat destruction]] through natural processes such as [[volcanism]], fire, and [[climate change]] is found in the fossil record.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}} For example, [[Carboniferous rainforest collapse|habitat fragmentation of tropical rainforests in Euramerica]] 300 million years ago led to a great loss of amphibian diversity, but simultaneously the drier climate spurred on a burst of diversity among reptiles.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;

===Human causes===
Habitat fragmentation is frequently caused by humans when [[native plant]]s is cleared for human activities such as [[agriculture]], [[Subdivision (land)|rural development]], [[urbanization]] and the creation of [[hydroelectric]] reservoirs. Habitats which were once continuous become divided into separate fragments. After intensive clearing, the separate fragments tend to be very small islands isolated from each other by cropland, pasture, pavement, or even barren land. The latter is often the result of [[slash and burn]] farming in [[tropical forest]]s. In the wheat belt of central western [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], 90% of the native vegetation has been cleared and over 99% of the [[tall grass prairie]] of [[North America]] has been cleared, resulting in extreme habitat fragmentation.

=== Endogenous vs. exogenous  ===
There are two types of processes that can lead to habitat fragmentation. There are exogenous processes and endogenous processes. Endogenous are process that develop as a part of a species biology so they typically include changes in biology, behavior and interactions within or between species. Endogenous threats can result in changes to breeding patterns or migration patterns and are often triggered by exogenous processes. Exogenous processes are independent of species biology and can include habitat degradation, habitat subdivision or habitat isolation. These processes can have a substantial impact on endogenous processes by fundamentally altering species behavior. Habitat subdivision or isolation can lead to changes in dispersal or movement of species including changes to seasonal migration. These changes can lead to decrease in a density of species, increased competition or even increased predation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Joern|last2=Lindenmayer|first2=David B.|date=February 7, 2007|title=Landscape Modification and Habitat Fragmentation: A synthesis|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.x|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography|volume=16|issue=3|pages=265–280|doi=10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.x|accessdate=March 22, 2018|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications ==

=== Habitat Loss and Biodiversity ===
One of the major ways that habitat fragmentation affects [[biodiversity]] is by reducing the amount of suitable habitat available for organisms. Habitat fragmentation often involves both [[habitat destruction]] and the subdivision of previously continuous habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fahrig|first1=Lenore|title=Effects of Habitat Fragmentation on Biodiversity|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|date=November 2003|volume=34|issue=1|pages=487–515|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants and other [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] organisms are disproportionately affected by some types of habitat fragmentation because they cannot respond quickly to the altered spatial configuration of the habitat.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lienert|first1=Judit|title=Habitat fragmentation effects on fitness of plant populations – a review|journal=Journal for Nature Conservation|date=July 2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=53–72|doi=10.1016/j.jnc.2003.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Habitat loss, which can occur through the process of habitat fragmentation, is considered to be the greatest threat to species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilcove | first1 = David S. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1998 | title = Quantifying Threats to Imperiled Species in the United States | jstor = 1313420 | journal = BioScience | volume = 48 | issue = 8| pages = 607–615 | doi=10.2307/1313420}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, the effect of the configuration of habitat patches within the landscape, independent of the effect of the amount of habitat within the landscape (referred to as fragmentation per se&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fahrig | first1 = L | year = 2003 | title = Effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity | url = | journal = Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 487–515 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132419}}&lt;/ref&gt;), has been suggested to be small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fahrig | first1 = L | year = 2013 | title = Rethinking patch size and isolation effects: the habitat amount hypothesis | url = | journal = J.

Area is the primary determinant of the number of species in a fragment&lt;ref name = Rosenzweig&gt;{{cite book | last = Rosenzweig | first = Michael L. | authorlink = Michael Rosenzweig | title = Species diversity in space and time | year = 1995 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | location = Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the relative contributions of demographic and genetic processes to the risk of global population extinction depend on habitat configuration, stochastic environmental variation and species features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robert | first1 = A | year = 2011 | title = Find the weakest link.

Thus fragmentation of habitat is an important cause of species extinction.&lt;ref name = Rosenzweig/&gt; Population dynamics of subdivided populations tend to vary [[wikt:asynchronous|asynchronous]]ly. In an unfragmented landscape a declining population can be "rescued" by immigration from a nearby expanding population. In fragmented landscapes, the distance between fragments may prevent this from happening. Additionally, unoccupied fragments of habitat that are separated from a source of [[Colonisation (biology)|immigrants]] by some barrier are less likely to be repopulated than adjoining fragments. Even small species such as the [[Columbia spotted frog]] are reliant on the rescue effect. Studies showed 25% of juveniles travel a distance over 200m compared to 4% of adults. Of these, 95% remain in their new locale, demonstrating that this journey is necessary for survival.&lt;ref name = Funk&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Funk W.C. |author2=Greene A.E. |author3=Corn P.S. |author4=Allendorf F.W. | year = 2005 | title = High dispersal in a frog species suggests that it is vulnerable to habitat fragmentation | url = | journal = [[Biology Letters|Biol. Lett.]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 13–6 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2004.0270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, habitat fragmentation leads to [[edge effect]]s. Microclimatic changes in light, temperature and wind can alter the ecology around the fragment, and in the interior and exterior portions of the fragment. [[wildfire|Fires]] become more likely in the area as humidity drops and temperature and wind levels rise. Exotic and pest species may establish themselves easily in such disturbed environments, and the proximity of domestic animals often upsets the natural ecology. Also, habitat along the edge of a fragment has a different climate and favours different species from the interior habitat. Small fragments are therefore unfavourable for species which require interior habitat. The percentage preservation of contiguous habitats is closely related to both genetic and species biodiversity preservation.  Generally a 10% remnant contiguous habitat will result in a 50% [[biodiversity loss]].&lt;ref&gt;Quammen, David (1997), "The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinction" (Scribner)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informed Conservation===
Habitat fragmentation is often a cause of species becoming [[threatened]] or [[endangered]]. The existence of viable habitat is critical to the survival of any species, and in many cases the fragmentation of any remaining habitat can lead to difficult decisions for conservation biologists. Given a limited amount of resources available for conservation is it preferable to protect the existing isolated patches of habitat or to buy back land to get the largest possible continuous piece of land. In rare cases a [[conservation reliant species]] may gain some measure of disease protection by being distributed in isolated habitats.  This ongoing debate is often referred to as [[SLOSS debate|SLOSS]] (Single Large or Several Small).

One solution to the problem of habitat fragmentation is to link the fragments by preserving or planting [[Habitat corridor|corridors]] of native vegetation. In some cases, a bridge or underpass may be enough to join two fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildlife Crossings: Animals survive with bridges and tunnels|url=http://www.wilderutopia.com/environment/wildlife/wildlife-crossings-animals-survive-bridges-tunnels/|publisher=Wilder Eutopia|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has the potential to mitigate the problem of isolation but not the loss of interior habitat.

Another mitigation measure is the enlargement of small remnants in order to increase the amount of interior habitat. This may be impractical since developed land is often more expensive and could require significant time and effort to restore.

The best solution is generally dependent on the particular species or ecosystem that is being considered. More mobile species, like most birds, do not need connected habitat while some smaller animals, like rodents, may be more exposed to predation in open land. These questions generally fall under the headings of [[metapopulation]]s [[island biogeography]].

=== Genetic Risks ===
As the remaining habitat patches are smaller, they tend to support smaller populations of fewer species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simberloff|first1=Daniel|date=1 January 1998|title=Small and Declining Populations|journal=Conservation Science and Action|language=en|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|pages=116–134|doi=10.1002/9781444313499.ch6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small populations are at an increased risk of a variety of genetic consequences that influence their long-term survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to conservation genetics|last1=Frankham|first1=Richard|last2=Ballou|first2=Jonathan D.|last3=Briscoe|first3=David A.|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521702713|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remnant populations often contain only a subset of the [[genetic diversity]] found in the previously continuous habitat.  Processes that act upon underlying genetic diversity such as [[adaptation]] have a smaller pool of fitness-maintaining alleles to survive in the face of environmental change.

==== Gene Flow and Inbreeding ====
[[Gene flow]] occurs when individuals of the same species exchange genetic information through reproduction. Populations can maintain genetic diversity through [[Animal migration|migration]]. When a habitat becomes fragmented and reduced in area, gene flow and migration is typically reduced. Fewer individuals will migrate into the remaining fragments, and small disconnected populations that may have once been part of a single large population will become reproductively isolated. Scientific evidence that gene flow is reduced due to fragmentation depends on the study species. While trees that have long-range pollination and dispersal mechanisms may not experience reduced gene flow following fragmentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=KRAMER|first=ANDREA T.|last2=ISON|first2=JENNIFER L.|last3=ASHLEY|first3=MARY V.|last4=HOWE|first4=HENRY F.|date=2008-06-09|title=The Paradox of Forest Fragmentation Genetics|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00944.x|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=878–885|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00944.x|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt; most species are at risk of reduced gene flow following habitat fragmentation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Reduced gene flow, and reproductive isolation can result in [[inbreeding]] between related individuals. Inbreeding does not always result in negative fitness consequences, but when inbreeding is associated with fitness reduction it is called [[inbreeding depression]]. Inbreeding becomes of increasing concern as the level of [[homozygosity]] increases, facilitating the expression of deleterious alleles that reduce the fitness. Habitat fragmentation can lead to inbreeding depression for many species due to reduced gene flow.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pavlova|first=Alexandra|last2=Beheregaray|first2=Luciano B.|last3=Coleman|first3=Rhys|last4=Gilligan|first4=Dean|last5=Harrisson|first5=Katherine A.|last6=Ingram|first6=Brett A.|last7=Kearns|first7=Joanne|last8=Lamb|first8=Annika M.|last9=Lintermans|first9=Mark|date=2017-05-11|title=Severe consequences of habitat fragmentation on genetic diversity of an endangered Australian freshwater fish: A call for assisted gene flow |journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=10|issue=6|pages=531–550|doi=10.1111/eva.12484|issn=1752-4571|pmc=5469170|pmid=28616062}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=W|last2=Qiao|first2=Y|last3=Li|first3=S|last4=Pan|first4=W|last5=Yao|first5=M|date=2017-02-15|title=Low genetic diversity and strong population structure shaped by anthropogenic habitat fragmentation in a critically endangered primate, Trachypithecus leucocephalus|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/hdy20172|journal=Heredity |volume=118|issue=6|pages=542–553|doi=10.1038/hdy.2017.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inbreeding depression is associated with conservation risks, like local extinction.

==== Genetic Drift ====
Small populations are more susceptible to [[genetic drift]]. Genetic drift is random changes to the genetic make up of populations and always leads to reductions in genetic diversity. The smaller the population is, the more likely genetic drift will be a driving force of evolution rather than natural selection. Because genetic drift is a random process, it does not allow species to become more adapted to their environment. Habitat fragmentation is associated with increases to genetic drift in small populations which can have negative consequences for the genetic diversity of the populations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Adaptation ====
In order for populations to evolve in response to natural selection, they must be large enough that natural selection is a stronger evolutionary force than genetic drift. Recent studies on the impacts of habitat fragmentation on adaptation in some plant species have suggested that organisms in fragmented landscapes may be able to adapt to fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matesanz|first=Silvia|last2=Teso|first2=Rubio|last3=Luisa|first3=María|last4=García-Fernández|first4=Alfredo|last5=Escudero|first5=Adrián|date=2017|title=Habitat Fragmentation Differentially Affects Genetic Variation, Phenotypic Plasticity and Survival in Populations of a Gypsum Endemic|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.00843/full|journal=Frontiers in Plant Science|language=English|volume=8|doi=10.3389/fpls.2017.00843|issn=1664-462X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dubois|first=Jonathan|last2=Cheptou|first2=Pierre-Olivier|date=2017-01-19|title=Effects of fragmentation on plant adaptation to urban environments|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/372/1712/20160038|journal=Phil.

=== Effect on Animal Behaviours===
Although the way habitat fragmentation affects the genetics and extinction rates of species has been heavily studied, fragmentation has also been shown to affect species' behaviours and cultures as well. This is important because social interactions have the ability to determine and have an effect on a species' fitness and survival. Habitat fragmentation alters the resources available and the structure of habitats, as a result alters the behaviours of species and the dynamics between differing species. Behaviours affected can be within a species such as reproduction, mating, foraging, species dispersal, communication and movement patterns or can be behaviours between species such as predator prey relationships. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Predation Behaviours ====
Habitat fragmentation due to anthropogenic activities has been shown to greatly affect the predator-prey dynamics of many species by altering the amount of species and the members of those species. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affects the natural predator-prey relationships between animals in a given community &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt; and forces them to alter their behaviours and interactions, therefore resetting the so called "behavioral space race" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shneider |first1=Michael F |title=Habitat loss, fragmentation and predator impact: spatial implications for prey conservation |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2001 |volume=38 |page=720-735}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The way in which fragmentation changes and re-shapes these interactions can occur in many different forms. Most prey species have patches of land that are refuge from their predators, allowing them the safety to reproduce and raise their young. Human introduced structures such as roads and pipelines alter these areas by facilitating predator activity in these refuges, increasing predator-prey overlap &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shneider |first1=Michael F |title=Habitat loss, fragmentation and predator impact: spatial implications for prey conservation |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2001 |volume=38 |page=720-735}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The opposite could also occur in the favour of prey, increasing prey refuge and subsequently decreasing predation rates. Fragmentation may also increase predator abundance or predator efficiency and therefore increase predation rates in this manner &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shneider |first1=Michael F |title=Habitat loss, fragmentation and predator impact: spatial implications for prey conservation |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2001 |volume=38 |page=720-735}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Several other factors can also increase or decrease the extent to which the shifting predator-prey dynamics affect certain species, including how diverse a predators diet is and how flexible habitat requirements are for predators and prey &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Depending on which species are affected and these other factors, fragmentation and its resulting effects on predator-prey dynamics may contribute to a species extinction &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In response to these new environmental pressures, new adaptive behaviours may be developed. Prey species may adapt to increased risk of predation with strategies such as altering mating tactics or changing behaviours and activities related to food and foraging &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
===== Boreal Woodland Caribous =====
In the boreal woodland caribous of British Columbia the effects of fragmentation are clearly demonstrated. The species refuge area is peatland bog which has been interrupted by linear features such as roads and pipelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DeMars |first1=Craig A |last2=Boutin |first2=Stan |title=Nowhere to hide: Effects of linear features on predator -prey dynamics in a large mammal system |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |date=September 4, 2017 |volume=87 |page=274-284 |doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12760}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These features have allowed their natural predators, the wolf and the black bear to more efficiently travel over landscapes and between patches of land&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DeMars |first1=Craig A |last2=Boutin |first2=Stan |title=Nowhere to hide: Effects of linear features on predator -prey dynamics in a large mammal system |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |date=September 4, 2017 |volume=87 |page=274-284 |doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12760}}&lt;/ref&gt;.Since their predators can more easily access the caribous' refuge, the females of the species attempt to avoid the area, affecting their reproductive behaviours and offspring produced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DeMars |first1=Craig A |last2=Boutin |first2=Stan |title=Nowhere to hide: Effects of linear features on predator -prey dynamics in a large mammal system |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |date=September 4, 2017 |volume=87 |page=274-284 |doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12760}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
==== Communication Behaviours ====
Fragmentation affecting the communication behaviours of birds has been well studied in Dupont's Lark. The Larks primarily reside in regions of Spain and are a small passerine bird which use songs as a means of cultural transmission between members of the species &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DeMars |first1=Craig A |last2=Boutin |first2=Stan |title=Nowhere to hide: Effects of linear features on predator -prey dynamics in a large mammal system |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |date=September 4, 2017 |volume=87 |page=274-284 |doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12760}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Larks have two distinct vocalizations, the song and the territorial call. The territorial call is used by males to defend and signal territory from other male Larks and is shared between neighbouring territories when males respond to a rivals song &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laiolo |first1=Paola |last2=Tella |first2=José L |title=Habitat fragmentation affects culture transmission: patterns of song matching in Dupont's lark |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2005 |volume=42 |page=1183-1193 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01093.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Occasionally it is used as a threat signal to signify an impending attack on territory &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laiolo |first1=Paola |last2=Tella |first2=José L |title=Erosion of animal cultures in fragmented landscapes |journal=The Ecological Society of America |date=2007 |volume=5 |issue=2 |page=68-72}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A large song repertoire can enhance a males ability to survive and reproduce as he has a greater ability to defend his territory from other males, and a larger number of males in the species means a larger variety of songs being transmitted &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laiolo |first1=Paola |last2=Tella |first2=José L |title=Habitat fragmentation affects culture transmission: patterns of song matching in Dupont's lark |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2005 |volume=42 |page=1183-1193 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01093.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fragmentation of the Dupont's Lark territory from agriculture, forestry and urbanization appears to have a large effect on their communication structures &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laiolo |first1=Paola |last2=Tella |first2=José L |title=Erosion of animal cultures in fragmented landscapes |journal=The Ecological Society of America |date=2007 |volume=5 |issue=2 |page=68-72}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Males only perceive territories of a certain distance to be rivals and so isolation of territory from others due to fragmentation leads to a decrease in territorial calls as the males no longer have any reason to use it or have any songs to match &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laiolo |first1=Paola |last2=Tella |first2=José L |title=Erosion of animal cultures in fragmented landscapes |journal=The Ecological Society of America |date=2007 |volume=5 |issue=2 |page=68-72}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
== Forest fragmentation ==
{{Commons category|Forest fragmentation}}
Forest fragmentation is a form of habitat fragmentation where forests are reduced (either naturally or man-made) to relatively small, isolated patches of forest known as forest fragments or forest remnants.&lt;ref name= "SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt; The intervening matrix that separates the remaining woodland patches can be natural open areas, [[farmland]], or developed areas. Following the principles of [[island biogeography]], remnant woodlands act like islands of forest in a sea of pastures, fields, subdivisions, shopping malls, etc. These fragments will then begin to undergo the process of [[ecosystem decay]].

Forest fragmentation also includes less subtle forms of discontinuities such as utility right-of-ways (ROWs). Utility ROWs are of ecological interest because they have become pervasive in many forest communities, spanning areas as large as 5 million acres in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=K.

=== Implications ===
Forest fragmentation is one of the greatest threats to [[biodiversity]] in forests, especially in the tropics.&lt;ref name = Bierregaard&gt;{{cite book | last = Bierregaard | first = Richard | editor=Claude Gascon |editor2=Thomas E. Lovejoy |editor3=Rita Mesquita | year = 2001 | title = Lessons from Amazonia: The Ecology and Conservation of a Fragmented Forest | isbn = 0-300-08483-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The problem of [[habitat destruction]] that caused the fragmentation in the first place is compounded by:
* the inability of individual forest fragments to support viable populations, especially of large vertebrates
* the local [[extinction]] of species that do not have at least one fragment capable of supporting a viable population
* [[edge effect]]s that alter the conditions of the outer areas of the fragment, greatly reducing the amount of true forest interior habitat.&lt;ref name = Harris&gt;{{cite book | last = Harris | first = Larry D. | year = 1984 | title =  The Fragmented Forest: Island Biogeography Theory and the Preservation of Biotic Diversity | publisher = The University of Chicago Press |isbn = 0-226-31763-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of fragmentation on the [[flora]] and [[fauna]] of a forest patch depends on a) the size of the patch, and b) its degree of isolation.  Isolation depends on the distance to the nearest similar patch, and the contrast with the surrounding areas.  For example, if a cleared area is [[reforestation|reforested]] or allowed to [[natural regeneration|regenerate]], the increasing [[structural diversity]] of the [[vegetation]] will lessen the isolation of the forest fragments.  However, when formerly forested lands are converted permanently to pastures, agricultural fields, or human-inhabited developed areas, the remaining forest fragments, and the biota within them, are often highly isolated.

Forest patches that are smaller or more isolated will lose species faster than those that are larger or less isolated.  A large number of small forest "islands" typically cannot support the same biodiversity that a single contiguous forest would hold, even if their combined area is much greater than the single forest. However, forest islands in rural landscapes greatly increase their biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Banaszak J. (ed.) 2000. Ecology of Forest Islands. Bydgoszcz University Press, Bydgoszcz, Poland, 313 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches to understanding habitat fragmentation ==
Two approaches that are typically used to understand habitat fragmentation and its ecological impacts.

=== Species-oriented approach ===
The species-oriented approach focuses specifically on individual species and how they each respond to their environment and habitat changes with in it.
This approach can be limited because it does only focus on individual species and does not allow for a broad view of the impacts of habitat fragmentation across species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Joern|last2=Lindenmayer|first2=David B.|title=Landscape Modification and Habitat Fragmentation: A synthesis|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography|date=February 7, 2007|volume=16|issue=3|pages=265–280|doi=10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.x|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.x|accessdate=March 22, 2018|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pattern-oriented approach ====

The pattern-oriented approach is based on land cover and its patterning in correlation with species occurrences. One model of study for landscape patterning is the patch-matrix-corridor model developed by [[Richard Forman]] The pattern-oriented approach focuses on land cover defined by human means and activities. This model has stemmed from [[island biogeography]] and tries to infer causal relationships between the defined landscapes and the occurrence of species or groups of species within them. The approach has limitations in its collective assumptions across species or landscapes which may not account for variations amongst them.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Joern &amp; B. Lindenmayer, David. (2007). Landscape modification and habitat fragmentation: a synthesis. Global Ecology and Biogeography. 16. 265-280. 10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Variegation Model ====

The other model is the variegation model. Variegated landscapes retain much of their natural vegetation but are intermixed with gradients of modified habitat &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landscape Ecology and Landscape Change|url=http://www.veac.vic.gov.au/reports/Chapter%202%20-%20Landscape%20Ecology%20and%20Landscape%20Change.pdf|accessdate=March 22, 2018|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model of habitat fragmentation typically applies to landscapes that are modified by agriculture. In contrast to the fragmentation model that is denoted by isolated patches of habitat surrounded by unsuitable landscape environments, the variegation model applies to landscapes modified by agriculture where small patches of habitat remain near the remnant original habitat. In between these patches are a matrix of grassland that are often modified versions of the original habitat. These areas do not present as much of a barrier to native species.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, S., and G. W. Barrett. “Habitat Variegation, An Alternative to Fragmentation.” Conservation Biology, vol. 6, no. 1, 1992, pp. 146–147. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2385863.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of creationism''' relates to the history of thought based on the premise that the natural [[universe]] had a beginning, and came into [[being]] [[supernaturally]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Montgomery|2012|pp=4–9}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Numbers1992}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[creationism]]'' in its broad sense covers a wide range of views and interpretations, and was not in common use before the late 19th century. Throughout [[recorded history]], many people have viewed the universe as a [[creation myth|created entity]]. Many ancient historical accounts from around the world refer to or imply a [[creation myth|creation]] of the earth and universe. Although specific historical understandings of creationism have used varying degrees of [[empirical]], [[spirtuality|spiritual]] and/or [[philosophical]] investigations, they are all based on the view that the universe was created. The [[Genesis creation narrative]] has provided a basic framework for Jewish and Christian [[epistemological]] understandings of how the universe came into [[being]] - through the divine intervention of the [[god]], [[Yahweh]]. Historically, literal interpretations of this narrative were more dominant than [[allegorical interpretations of Genesis|allegorical ones]].{{sfn|Forster|Marston|2001|}}

From the 18th century on, various views aimed at reconciling the [[Abrahamic religions]] and Genesis with [[geology]], [[biology]] and other [[science]]s developed in [[Western culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author-last = Montgomery | author-first = David R. | title = The evolution of creationism | journal = GSA Today | volume = 22 | number = 11 | pages = 4–9 | publisher = Geological Society of America | doi = 10.1130/GSATG158A.1 | date = November 2012  | url = http://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/22/11/article/i1052-5173-22-11-4.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Numbers_Ordinary_View"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterbalance.net/history/ordcreat-frame.html|title=The ‘Ordinary’ View of Creation|last=Numbers|first=Ronald L|authorlink=Ronald Numbers|website=Counterbalance Interactive Library|publisher=Counterbalance Foundation|location=Seattle, WA|accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the word [[Creationism (soul)|creationism]] referred to a doctrine of creation of the soul. Those holding that [[species]] had been created in a separate act, such as [[Omphalos (book)|Philip Gosse]] in 1857, were generally called "advocates of creation", though they were also called "creationists" in private correspondence between [[Charles Darwin]] and his friends, dating from 1856.&lt;ref name="Darwin_letters_1856_1863" /&gt;

In the 20th century the word "creationism" became associated with the anti-evolution movement of the 1920s and [[young Earth creationism]], but this usage was contested by other groups, such as [[old Earth creationism|old Earth creationists]] and [[theistic evolution|evolutionary creationists]], who hold different concepts of creation, such as the acceptance of the [[age of the Earth]] and biological evolution as understood by the [[scientific community]].&lt;ref name="Stewart2009"&gt;[[#Stewart 2010|Haarsma 2010]], p. 168,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} "Some Christians, often called 'Young Earth creationists,' reject evolution in order to maintain a semi-literal interpretation of certain biblical passages. Other Christians, called 'progressive creationists,' accept the scientific evidence for some evolution over a long history of the earth, but also insist that God must have performed some miracles during that history to create new life-forms. The theory of Intelligent Design, as it is promoted in North America is a form of progressive creation. Still other Christians, called 'theistic evolutionists' or 'evolutionary creationists,' assert that the scientific theory of evolution and the religious beliefs of Christianity can both be true."&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

''[[The Genesis Flood]]'' (1961) became the most successful young earth creationist publication after 1945''.'' From the mid-1960s, creationists in the United States promoted the teaching of "scientific creationism" using "[[Flood geology]]" in public school science classes.&lt;ref name="encarta"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Numbers |first=Ronald L |encyclopedia=[[Encarta|Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2009]] |title=Creationism |url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_761580511___0/Creationism.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022061756/http://encarta.msn.com/text_761580511___0/Creationism.html |archivedate=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2014-03-09 |publisher=[[Microsoft|Microsoft Corporation]] |location=Redmond, WA}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the legal judgment of the case ''[[Daniel v. Waters]]'' (1975) ruled that teaching creationism in public schools contravened the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the content was stripped of overt biblical references and renamed creation science. When the court case ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' (1987) ruled that creation science similarly contravened the constitution, all references to "creation" in a draft school textbook were changed to refer to intelligent design, which was presented by creationists as a new scientific theory. The ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|Kitzmiller v. Dover]]'' (2005) ruling concluded that intelligent design is not science and contravenes the constitutional restriction on teaching religion in public school science classes.&lt;ref name="Flank_April2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm |title=Creationism/ID: A Short Legal History |last=Flank |first=Lenny |website=Talk Reason |date=April 24, 2006 |accessdate=2014-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823063247/http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm |archivedate=August 23, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, [[Bill Nye]] ("[[Bill Nye the Science Guy|The Science Guy]]") expressed his concern that ''creationist views'' threaten [[science education]] and [[innovation]]s in the United States.&lt;ref name="APNews-20120924"&gt;{{cite news |last=Luvan |first=Dylan |date=September 24, 2012 |title=Bill Nye Warns: Creation Views Threaten US Science |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/bill-nye-warns-creation-views-threaten-us-science |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Youtube-20120823"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fowler |first=Jonathan |last2=Rodd |first2=Elizabeth |title=Bill Nye: Creationism Is Not Appropriate For Children |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHbYJfwFgOU |date=August 23, 2012 |website=[[YouTube]] |publisher=[[Big Think]] |location=New York |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141103-JD"&gt;{{cite news |last=Deiviscio |first=Jeffrey |title=A Fight for the Young Creationist Mind - In ‘Undeniable,’ Bill Nye Speaks Evolution Directly to Creationists |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/science/in-undeniable-bill-nye-speaks-evolution-directly-to-creationists.html |date=November 3, 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=November 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation and Modern science==
{{See also|History of evolutionary thought}}
In the 15th and 16th centuries, [[Columbian Exchange|discoveries in new lands]] brought knowledge of the diversity of life. In 1605, [[Francis Bacon]] emphasized that the works of God in nature teach us how to interpret the [[Bible]], and the [[Baconian method]] introduced the empirical approach which became central to modern science.&lt;ref name="James_Moore"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Moore |first=James |authorlink=James Moore (biographer) |interviewer=[[Krista Tippett]] |title=Evolution and Wonder: Understanding Charles Darwin |url=http://www.onbeing.org/program/evolution-and-wonder-understanding-charles-darwin/transcript/899 |publisher=[[NPR]] |work=[[On Being|Speaking of Faith with Krista Tippett]] |date=September 20, 2007 |accessdate=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural theology]] sought evidence in nature supporting an active role of God, and attempts were made to reconcile new knowledge with the biblical [[Flood myth|deluge myth]] and story of [[Noah's Ark]].&lt;ref name="floodgeol"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/p82.htm |title=History of the Collapse of 'Flood Geology' and a Young Earth |website=PhilVaz.com |publisher=Philip J. Porvaznik |accessdate=2014-03-09}} Adapted from [[#Young 1995|Young 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt; The development of modern [[geology]] in the 18th and 19th centuries found [[Stratum|geological strata]] and [[Fossil#Fossilization processes|fossil]] sequences indicating a very ancient Earth. The [[diluvial]] cosmogonies fell victim to their own success, as the spirit of scientific inquiry they had stimulated, gradually led to discoveries that undercut the biblical premises of flood geology and [[catastrophism]].&lt;ref name="floodgeol" /&gt;

From around the start of the 19th century, ideas such as [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]'s concept of [[transmutation of species]] had gained supporters in Paris and [[Edinburgh]], mostly amongst anatomists.&lt;ref name="rsf" /&gt; The anonymous publication of ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'' in 1844 aroused wide public interest with support from [[Quakers]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], but was strongly criticised by the religious establishment and the scientific community, which called for solidly backed science. In 1859, Charles Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' provided that evidence from an authoritative and respected source, and within a decade or so convinced scientists that evolution occurs. This view clashed with that of conservative evangelicals in the [[Church of England]], but in 1860 their attention turned to the much greater uproar about ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' by [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Anglican theologians]], which introduced "[[Historical criticism|higher criticism]]", a hermeneutic method re-examining the Bible and questioning literal readings.{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991}} By 1875 most American [[natural history|naturalists]] supported ideas of theistic evolution, often involving [[special creation]] of [[human|human beings]].&lt;ref name="encarta" /&gt;

At this time those holding that species had been separately created were generally called "advocates of creation," but they were occasionally called "creationists" in private correspondence between Charles Darwin and his friends.&lt;ref name="Numbers_Antievolutionists"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.counterbalance.net/history/anticreat-frame.html |title=Antievolutionists and Creationists |last=Numbers |first=Ronald L |website=Counterbalance Interactive Library |publisher=Counterbalance Foundation |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term appears in letters Darwin wrote between 1856 and 1863,&lt;ref name="Darwin_letters_1856_1863"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-1919 |title=Darwin, C.

By this time, geologists recognised that the Earth was millions of years old. The exact chronology proposed by Darwin was disputed by other geologists, and the leading physicist [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin#Age of the Earth: geology and theology|William Thomson]] (later enobled as Lord Kelvin) produced an analyses of the heat energy and thermal histories of [[Age of the Earth#Convective mantle and radioactivity|the Earth]] and Sun which yielded age estimates that were too short for gradual evolution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4AWPFdyrWIC|title=Lord Kelvin and the Age of the Earth|last=Burchfield|first=Joe D.|date=1990-05-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=|isbn=9780226080437|location=|pages=69 ff|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson's colleague [[Fleeming Jenkin]] wrote an 1867 review of Darwin's ''On the Origin of species'' which opposed evolution on the basis of the shortened time available.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Kelvin's age paradox was not [[Age of the Earth#Convective mantle and radioactivity|resolved]] until it was discovered in the 20th century that the Earth is heated by radioactive decay, that its internal thermal gradient is affected by mantle convection, and that the Sun is heated by nuclear fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2000|title=Kelvin's age of the Earth paradox revisited|journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]|volume=105|issue=B6|pages=13155–13158|bibcode=2000JGR...10513155S|doi=10.1029/2000JB900028|last1=Stacey|first1=Frank D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, the [[Big Bang|big-bang theory]] has been the prevailing [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[Scientific model|model]] for the [[universe]]. It was envisioned by a Roman Catholic priest, Monsignor [[Georges Lemaître]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dp27bi.html|title=People and Discoveries: Big Bang Theory|publisher=[[PBS]]|work=A Science Odyssey|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lemaître suggested that the evident expansion of the universe, if projected back in time, meant that at some finite time in the past all the mass of the universe was concentrated into a single point, a "primeval atom" where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemaître|first=G.|date=1931|title=The Evolution of the Universe: Discussion|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=128|issue=3234|pages=699–701|bibcode=1931Natur.128..704L|doi=10.1038/128704a0|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1920s and 1930s almost every major cosmologist subscribed to a view that the universe is in an eternal [[Steady state theory|steady state]]. After Lemaître proposed his theory, some scientists complained that its assumption that time had a beginning amounted to a reimportation of religious concepts into physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cosmology and Controversy|last=Kragh|first=H.|date=1996|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=0-691-02623-8|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the expression "Big Bang" was coined by [[Fred Hoyle]] in 1949, he meant it to be slightly pejorative, but the term stuck and gained currency. Lemaître himself concluded that an initial "[[Ex nihilo|creation]]-like" event must have occurred. The Big-Bang is contrary to young-Earth creationism, sensu stricto. But it has been welcomed by other Christian creeds, and it is in line with the [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] concept of creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=a8nuAAAAMAAJ|title=Coming of age in the Milky Way|last=Ferris|first=T.|date=1988|publisher=[[William Morrow and Company|Morrow]]|isbn=978-0-688-05889-0|pages=274, 438|ref=harv}}, citing {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eYHvAAAAMAAJ|title=The Big bang and Georges Lemaître: proceedings of a symposium in honour of G.

===Early history===

[[David Sedley]], in his book ''Creationism and Its Critics in Antiquity'', traces creationary thought to the [[presocratic]] thinkers [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Empedocles]], in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sedley|2009|p=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sedley states that Anaxagoras was recognized by [[Plato]] as "the first overt champion of a creative cosmic intelligence. Anaxagoras theory was that the original state of the world was a roughly even mixture of all opposites, and that it was the effect of the action of ''nous'' (intelligence or mind) that led to the partial separation of such opposites, hot from cold, land from water, rarefied from dense.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sedley|2009|pp=8, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anaxagoras also developed the philosophical innovation of [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] of mind from matter, diverging from the stringent [[monism]] of his predecessor, [[Parmenides]].{{sfn|Sedley|2009|p=11}} Empedocles proposed a system whereby two competing divine forces, Love (harmony and blending) and Strife (separation) had alternating dominion over the universe and the four elements, earth, water, air and fire.{{sfn|Sedley|2009|p=32, 33}}

Around 45 BCE, [[Cicero]] made a [[teleological argument]] that anticipated the [[watchmaker analogy]],{{Synthesis inline|date=November 2010}} in ''De natura deorum'', ii. 34
:When you see a sundial or a water-clock, you see that it tells the time by design and not by chance. How then can you imagine that the universe as a whole is devoid of purpose and intelligence, when it embraces everything, including these artifacts themselves and their artificers? (Gjertsen 1989, p. 199, quoted by Dennett 1995, p. 29){{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

c. 170 &amp;ndash; Theophilus of Antioch wrote in defense of creation beliefs and a relatively young Earth:
:"There are not myriads of myriads of years, even though Plato said such a period had elapsed between the deluge and his own time, . . . The world is not uncreated nor is there spontaneous production of everything, as Pythagoras and the others have babbled; instead the world is created and is providentially governed by the God who made everything. And the whole period of time and the years can be demonstrated to those who wish to learn the truth. . . . The total number of years from the creation of the world is 5,695.29 ... If some period has escaped our notice, say 50 or 100 or even 200 years, at any rate it is not myriads, or thousands of years as it was for Plato . . . and the rest of those who wrote falsehoods. It may be that we do not know the exact total of all the years simply because the additional months and days are not recorded in the sacred books."{{cite quote|date=November 2010}}

170 &amp;ndash; [[Galen]], [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[physician]] wrote against creation beliefs in ''On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body'', 11.14:
:It is precisely this point in which our own opinion and that of Plato and of the other Greeks who follow the right method in natural science differ from the position taken up by Moses. For the latter it seems enough to say that God simply willed the arrangement of matter and it was presently arranged in due order; for he believes everything to be possible with God, even should he wish to make a bull or a horse out of ashes. We, however, do not hold this; we say that certain things are impossible by nature and that God does not even attempt such things at all but that he [sic] chooses the best out of the possibility of becoming.

In the 5th century, [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] wrote ''The Literal Meaning of Genesis'' in which he argued that Genesis should be interpreted as God forming the Earth and life from pre-existing matter and allowed for an allegorical interpretation of the first chapter of Genesis. For example: he argues that the six-day structure of creation presented in the book of Genesis represents a logical framework, rather than the passage of time in a physical way. On the other hand, Augustine called for a historical view of the remainder of the history recorded in Genesis, including the creation of [[Adam and Eve]], and the [[Noah's Ark|Flood]]. Apart from his specific views, Augustine recognizes that the interpretation of the creation story is difficult, and remarks that Christians should be willing to change their minds about it as new information comes up. He also warned believers not to rashly interpret things literally that might be allegorical, as it would discredit the faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Young | first = Davis A. | authorlink = | title = The Contemporary Relevance Of Augustine's View Of Creation | journal = [[Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith]] | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = 42–45 | publisher = [[American Scientific Affiliation]] | url = http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1988/PSCF3-88Young.html| doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

610 - 632 &amp;ndash; [[Muhammad]] reports receiving the [[Qur'an]] by [[divine revelation]].

===Renaissance and protoscience===

The [[Renaissance]] starting in the 14th century saw the establishment of [[protoscience]] that eventually became modern [[science]]. This was a period of great [[social change]].

The [[Protestant Reformation]] introduced lay people reading the Bible in translation and more literal understandings,&lt;ref name=rsf&gt;{{Cite book

====Protoscience====
The [[Baconian method]] introduced the empirical [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=moore&gt;{{cite web | last = Moore | first = James | authorlink = James Moore (biographer) | title = Evolution and Wonder - Understanding Charles Darwin | work = Speaking of Faith (Radio Program) | publisher = American Public Media | url = http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/darwin/transcript.shtml | accessdate = 2007-06-27 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081222020720/http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/darwin/transcript.shtml | archivedate = 2008-12-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural theology]] sought evidence in nature supporting Christianity.

[[Nicolaus Copernicus]]'s idea of [[Heliocentrism]] was proposed in the 16th century and established by [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]. This overturned the Greek [[Ptolemaic system]] of [[geocentrism]], which had been adopted as Church dogma with the [[Influence of Hellenic philosophy on Christianity|fusion of Christianity with Greek Philosophy]] in the first few centuries AD.

The English naturalist [[John Ray]] (29 November 1627 - 17 January 1705) is sometimes referred to{{By whom|date=November 2010}} as the father of English natural history. As well as collecting and classifying plants, he wrote two books entitled ''The Wisdom of God manifested in the Works of the Creation'' (1691), and ''Miscellaneous Discourses concerning the Dissolution and Changes of the World'' (1692), which included essays on ''The Primitive Chaos and Creation of the World'', ''The General Deluge, its Causes and Effects'', and ''The Dissolution of the World and Future Conflagrations''. In ''The Wisdom of God'' he included many of the familiar examples of purposive adaptation and design in nature (the [[teleological argument]]), such as the structure of the eye, the hollowness of the bones, the camel's stomach and the hedgehog's armor.

[[Carl Linnaeus]], in the 18th century, established a system of classification of [[species]] by similarity. At the time, the system of classification was seen as the plan of organization used by God in his creation. Later, the theory of evolution applied it as groundwork for the idea of [[common descent]].

====Religious arguments====
In 1650 the [[Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh]], [[James Ussher]], published a monumental history of the world from creation to 70 A.D. He used the recorded genealogies and ages in the [[bible]] to derive what is commonly known as the [[Ussher chronology]]. This calculated a date for [[Creation myth|creation]] at 4004 BC. The date was widely accepted in the English-speaking world.

In 1696, [[William Whiston]] published ''[[A New Theory of the Earth]]'', in which he proposed an account of the creation of the world. He grounded his argument in the following three ''Postulata'':
:1) The obvious or literal sense of scripture is the true and real one, where no evidence can be given to the contrary.
:2) That which is clearly accountable in a natural way, is not, without reason to be ascribed to a miraculous power.
:3) What ancient tradition asserts of the constitution of nature, or of the origin and primitive states of the world, is to be allowed for true, where ‘tis fully agreeable to scripture, reason, and philosophy.
Whiston was the first to propose that the [[deluge (mythology)|global flood]] was caused by the water in the tail of a [[comet]].

The English divine [[William Derham]] (26 November 1657 - 5 April 1735) published his ''Artificial Clockmaker'' in 1696 and ''Physico-Theology'' in 1713. These books were [[teleological argument]]s for the being and attributes of God, and were used by Paley nearly a century later.

The [[Watchmaker analogy]] was put by [[Bernard Nieuwentyt]] (1730) and referred to several times by Paley. A charge of wholesale [[plagiarism]] from this book was brought against Paley in the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum]] for 1848, but the famous illustration of the watch was not peculiar to Nieuwentyt, and had been appropriated by many others before Paley.

[[David Hume]] (26 April 1711 - 25 August 1776), a Scottish naturalist, empiricist, and skeptic, argued for naturalism and against belief in God. He argued that order stems from both design and natural processes, so it is not necessary to infer a designer when one sees order; that the design argument, even if it worked, would not support a robust or even moral God, that the argument [[begging the question|begged the question]] of the origin of God, and that design was merely a [[anthropomorphism|human projection]] onto the forces of nature.

==Scientific era==

===Modern geology and gap theory===
{{See also|Gap creationism}}
[[James Hutton]] is often viewed as the first modern [[geology|geologist]]. In 1785 he presented a paper entitled ''Theory of the Earth'' to the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. Based upon a detailed examination of what we now recognise as the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere he showed that the present forces seen on the earth were sufficient to explain all the phenomena observed.  He wrote "The Mosaic history places this beginning of man at no great distance; and there has not been found, in natural history, any document by which a high antiquity can be attribted to the human race.  But this is not the case with regard to the inferior species of animals, particularly those which inhabit the ocean and its shorees.  We find in natural history monuments which prove that those animals had long existed; and thus we thus preocure a measure for the computation of time extremely remote though far from being precisely ascertained"(p8)  Based upon these principles of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], he demonstrated that the Earth is much older than had previously been supposed in order to allow enough time for mountains to be [[erosion|eroded]] and for [[sediment]] to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea, which in turn were raised up to become dry land.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Hutton|Hutton, J.]] (1785) ''Theory of the Earth''&lt;/ref&gt;  The presumption that the world was only 6,000 years old was scientifically abandoned as a result of Hutton's work.

This development of the scientific discipline of geology, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and the discovery that the Earth was far older than a literal interpretation of the [[Book of Genesis]] could account for, led to the development, and popularity, of the ''Gap Theory'' (now known as [[gap creationism]]) to accommodate these discoveries. Gap Theory assumes a recent six-day creation, but also that the Earth existed for many ages before this event, ending in cataclysm and a new creation (hence its alternative title 'ruin-restoration theory').&lt;ref name=McIver&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, "a heterogeneous group of writers," known as [[scriptural geologist]]s, arose to oppose these discoveries,&lt;ref name = Rudwick&gt;''[[The Great Devonian Controversy]]'', [[Martin J. S. Rudwick]], 1988, {{ISBN|0-226-73102-2}}, pp 42-44&lt;/ref&gt; and the Gap Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Livingstone|Hart|Noll|1999|pp=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their views were marginalised and ignored by the [[scientific community]] of their time.&lt;ref name = Rudwick/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"But since &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[William Henry Fitton]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and other geologists regarded [scriptural geology] as scientifically worthless…" — ''Worlds before Adam'', [[Martin J.

From 1830 to 1833, the geologist and clergyman Sir [[Charles Lyell]] released a three volume publication called ''Principles of Geology'', which developed Hutton's ideas of uniformitarianism, and in the second volume set out a gradualist variation of creation beliefs in which each species had its "centre of creation" and was designed for the habitat, but would become extinct when the habitat changed. [[John Herschel]] supported this gradualist view and wrote to Lyell urging a search for natural laws underlying the "mystery of mysteries" of how species formed.&lt;ref&gt;Herschel, J.F.W and Paul l Kesaris (1990), "Letters and papers of Sir John Herschel: a guide to the manuscripts and microfilm" (University Publications of America)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857, [[Philip Henry Gosse]] published ''[[Omphalos (book)|Omphalos: Untying the Geological Knot]]''. The [[Omphalos hypothesis]] argued that the World had been created by God recently, but with the appearance of old age. This was largely ignored, and some considered it [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] because it accused the Creator of deceit. Some [[Young Earth creationism|young Earth creationists]] would later incorporate parts of his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Henry Gosse|Gosse, P.H.]] (1857) ''Omphalos: Untying the Geological Knot''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Darwinian biology===
[[Erasmus Darwin]] published his [[Zoönomia]] between 1794 and 1796 foreshadowing Lamarck's ideas on evolution, and even suggesting ''"that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which the great First Cause endued with animality ... possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down these improvements by generation to its posterity."''

Advances in [[paleontology]], led by [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]] saw the recording of the first [[fossil record]]s that showed the [[transmutation of species]]. Then, [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] proposed, in his ''Philosophie Zoologique'' of 1809, a theory of evolution, later known as [[Lamarckism]], by which traits that were "needed" were passed on.

[[File:WilliamPaley.jpg|frame|right|William Paley (1743 - 1805) proponent of the [[Watchmaker analogy]], a variant of the [[teleological argument]]]]
In 1802, [[William Paley]] published ''[[Natural Theology]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[William Paley|Paley, Wm]] (1802) ''Natural Theology''&lt;/ref&gt; in response to naturalists such as Hume, refining the ancient [[teleological argument]] (or argument from design) to argue for the existence of God. He argued that life was so intricately designed and interconnected as to be analogous to a watch. Just as when one finds a watch, one reasonable infers that it was designed and constructed by an intelligent being, although one has never seen the designer, when one observes the complexity and intricacy of life, one may reasonably infer that it was designed and constructed by God, although one has never seen God.

The official eight ''[[Bridgewater Treatises]]'' "On the Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation" included the Reverend [[William Buckland]]'s 1836 ''Geology and Mineralogy considered with reference to Natural Theology'' setting out the logic of day-age, gap theory, and theistic evolution.
The computing pioneer [[Charles Babbage]] then published his unofficial ''Ninth Bridgewater Treatise'' in 1837, putting forward a thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator, making laws (or programs) that then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with ''ad hoc'' miracles each time a new species was required.

By 1836 the anatomist [[Richard Owen]] had theories influenced by [[Johannes Peter Müller]] that living matter had an "organising energy," a life-force that directed the growth of tissues and also determined the lifespan of the individual and of the species. In the 1850s Owen developed ideas of "archetypes" in the Divine mind producing a sequence of species in "ordained continuous becoming" in which new species appeared at birth.

Late in 1844 the anonymous publication of ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'' popularised the idea of divinely ordered development of everything from [[stellar evolution]] to [[transmutation of species]]. It quickly gained fashionable success in court circles and aroused interest in all sections of society. It also aroused religious controversy, and after initially being slow to respond, the scientific establishment attacked the book. It continued to be a best seller to around the end of the century.

[[Herbert Spencer]] was a 19th-century English philosopher who developed ideas about the unifying concept of evolution across the natural and social sciences. Spencer is the first to develop a theory of [[cultural evolution]] and is considered by some to be the father of [[Social Darwinism]]. It is also he and not Darwin who coined the phrase ''[[survival of the fittest]]''. Much of the [[positivist]] ideas of progress that dominated the social science philosophy of Spencer and subsequent Social Darwinists has been criticized by present-day [[sociologists]], but such ideas continue to be one of the major critiques made by creationists against evolution in general, even though strict biological evolution does not depend on it nor offer any type of endorsement of so-called "social Darwinism" or its derivative philosophies such as [[eugenics]].

==Age of Darwin==
[[File:Darwin sexual caricature.gif|thumb|right|When Darwin appeared in public with a beard in 1866, cartoonists were quick to satirise his ideas about [[common descent]] with apes. In this 1872 cartoon Darwin is fascinated by the apparent [[steatopygia]] in the new fashion for [[bustle]]s. The woman asks him to "leave my emotions alone," a reference to Darwin's new book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]''.]]
The decades following [[Charles Darwin]]'s publication of ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', in 1859, saw the overwhelming majority of North American and British naturalists accept some form of evolution, with many liberal and educated churchmen following their example, and thereby rejecting a [[biblical literalism|biblically literalist]] interpretation of Genesis.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p 15&lt;/ref&gt; Although Darwin's work rejected "the dogma of separate creations," he invoked creation as the probable source of the first lifeforms ("into which life was first breathed"). This led [[Asa Gray]], who was both religiously orthodox, and Darwin's most prominent American supporter, to suggest that Darwin had accepted "a supernatural beginning of life on earth" and that he should therefore allow a second "special origination" for humanity. Darwin however rejected this view, and used uncompromisingly naturalistic language in place of biblical idiom, starting with ''The Descent of Man'' in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) pp 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's book caused less controversy than he had feared, as the idea of evolution had been widely popularized in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[United Kingdom|Britain]] by the 1844 publication of ''[[Vestiges of Creation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://darwin-online.org.uk/darwin.html Charles Darwin: gentleman naturalist: A biographical sketch], John van Wyhe, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it posed fundamental questions about the [[relationship between religion and science]]. Though ''Origin'' did not explicitly deal with human evolution, the jump was one both supporters and opponents of the theory immediately made, and the idea that man was simply an animal ([[common descent]]) who had evolved a particular set of characteristics &amp;mdash; rather than a spiritual being created by God &amp;mdash; continued to be one of the most divisive notions of the 19th century. One of the most famous disputes was the [[Oxford]] Debate of 1860, in which [[Thomas Henry Huxley|T.H. Huxley]], Darwin's self-appointed "bulldog," [[debate]]d evolution with [[Samuel Wilberforce]], the [[Bishop]] of Oxford. Both sides claimed victory, then the controversy was overshadowed by the even greater theological furore over the publication of ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' questioning whether miracles were atheistic, bringing to a head arguments in the [[Church of England]] between [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theologians]] supporting [[higher criticism]], and conservative [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/religion/essays.html Introduction to Essays and Reviews (1860)], Glenn Everett, Associate Professor of English, University of Tennessee at Martin, VictorianWeb.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  The essays were described by their opponents as [[heresy|heretical]], and the essayists were called "The Seven Against Christ."&lt;ref name=dm500-1&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991| pp=500–501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862, the [[Glasgow|Glaswegian]] physicist [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin)]] published calculations, based on his presumption of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], and that the heat of the sun was caused by its gravitational shrinkage, that fixed the [[age of the Earth]] and the [[solar system]] at between 20&amp;nbsp;million and 400&amp;nbsp;million years, i.e. between ~3,000 and ~70,000 times Ussher's value. This came as a blow to Darwin's anticipated timescale, though the idea of an ancient Earth was generally accepted without much controversy. Darwin and Huxley, while not accepting the timing, said it merely implied faster evolution. It would take further advances in [[geology]] and the discovery of [[radioactivity]] that showed that the sun was in fact heated by [[nuclear fusion]] that demonstrated the present estimated 4.567&amp;nbsp;billion years, or ~700,000 times Ussher's value. A way to measure the [[age of the universe]] would be discovered by [[Edwin Hubble]] in the 1930s, but due to observational constraints, an accurate measurement of the [[Hubble constant]] would not be forthcoming until the late 1990s. According to the [[ESA]]/[[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] data, released in March 2013, the age of the universe is approximately 13.8&amp;nbsp;billion years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; or some ~2,000,000 times Ussher's value.

The Swiss-American paleontologist [[Louis Agassiz]] opposed evolution. He believed that there had been a series of catastrophes with divine re-creations, evidence of which could be seen in rock fossils. Though uniformitarianism dominated ideas from the 1840s onwards, [[Catastrophism]] remained a major [[scientific paradigm|paradigm]] in [[geology]] until replaced by new models that allowed for both cataclysms (such as [[meteorites|meteor strikes]]) and gradualist patterns (such as [[ice age]]s) to explain observed geologic phenomena.

In 1878, American Presbyterians held the first annual [[Niagara Bible Conference]], founding the [[Christian fundamentalist]] movement, which took its name from the "Five Fundamentals" of 1910, and came to be concerned about the implications of evolution for the accuracy of the Bible. But by no means all orthodox Presbyterians were opposed to evolution as a possible method of the Divine procedure. Dr [[Charles Hodge]] of Princeton Seminary objected in 1874 to the atheism he considered inplied in the naturalistic explanation but both he and Dr [[B. B. Warfield]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield]] Evolution, Science &amp; Scripture (Baker 2000) ed. [[Mark Noll]] &amp; [[David N. Livingstone]]&lt;/ref&gt; were open to its possibility/probability within limits, and most churchmen sought to reconcile Darwinism with Christianity.

Darwin died in 1882. In 1915, [[Elizabeth Cotton, Lady Hope]], spread rumors that he had repented and accepted God on his deathbed. Lady Hope's story is almost certainly false, and it is unlikely that she visited Darwin as she claimed.&lt;ref&gt;"''Charles Darwin's Death-Bed: Story of Conversion Denied,''" Mrs R B Litchfield, The Christian, February 23, 1922, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 20th century==
In the 1920s, the term ''creationism'' became particularly associated with a [[fundamentalist Christianity|Christian fundamentalist]] movement opposed to the idea of [[human evolution]], which succeeded in getting teaching of [[evolution]] banned in United States [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} From the mid-1960s [[young Earth creationism]] proposed "scientific creationism" using "[[Flood geology]]" as support for a literal reading of Genesis.&lt;ref name=encarta/&gt; After legal judgements that teaching this in public schools contravened constitutional [[separation of Church and State]], it was stripped of biblical references and called [[creation science]], then when this was ruled unacceptable, [[intelligent design]] was coined.&lt;ref name=lenny&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm |title=Creationism/ID, A Short Legal History |author=Lenny Flank |publisher=Talk Reason |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823063247/http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm |archivedate=2014-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decades before the start of the 20th century, and the first decades of that century, have been described as [[the eclipse of Darwinism]]. Darwin's work had quickly established scientific consensus that evolution occurred, but there was considerable disagreement about the mechanisms involved, and few gave as much significance to natural selection as Darwin himself. Evolution itself was assumed, but the ''mechanism'' of how it happened was in considerable debate, and none had anything near to a consensus. Among these theories were [[neo-Lamarckism]] (which merged certain aspects of Lamarck's theory of acquired characteristics with certain aspects of Darwinian evolution), [[orthogenesis]] ("straight-line" evolution, which talked about evolution towards a specific goal by forces within the organism), and the discontinuous variation of [[Mendelism]] and [[Hugo De Vries]]' [[mutation theory]]. Some of these alternative theories, in particular neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis, allowed more easily for an interpretation of the intervention of God, which appealed to many scientists at the time. The term ''[[Darwinism]]'' had covered a wide range of ideas, many of which differed from Darwin's views, but it became associated with the minority view of [[August Weismann]] who went further than Darwin by rejecting [[inheritance of acquired characters]] and attributing all evolution to natural selection, a view also called [[neo-Darwinism]]. By the first decades of the 20th century, the debate had become generally one between continuous-variation biometricians and discontinuous-variety Mendelians. In the 1930s and 1940s, though, they were combined with natural selection into the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]], which soon became the dominant model in the scientific community. This model has also been called Darwinism and neo-Darwinism.

[[George McCready Price]] was important in developing ''[[flood geology]]'', and while he had limited influence at a time when all geologists had long accepted an ancient earth, many of his ideas that a young earth could be deduced from science were taken up later. Price was a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], and followed one of the founders of the church, [[Ellen White]], in seeing fossils as evidence of the [[Great Flood]]. In 1906, Price published ''Illogical Geology: The Weakest Point in the Evolution Theory'' in which he offered $1000 ''"to any one who will, in the face of the facts here presented, show me how to prove that one kind of fossil is older than another."''&lt;ref name="Numbers2006"&gt;{{harv|Numbers|2006)}}{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church distilled the principles of Christian fundamentalism into what were known as the "five fundamentals," one of which was the inerrancy of the [[Bible|Scriptures]], including the Genesis account of creation. ''[[The Fundamentals]]'' were published as a series of essays. Its authors accepted ancient earth geology, while holding different ideas about how this was reconciled with biblical accounts. The views expressed on evolution were mixed: two short articles were anti evolution, one anonymous and one by the little-known Henry Beach. Their focus was on human evolution, as were attacks made on evolution by [[Dyson Hague]]. Major figures were explicitly open to the possibility that God created through a Lamarckian form of evolution: long articles by [[James Orr (theologian)|James Orr]] and [[George Frederick Wright]] expressed this openness, and [[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield]] and A H Strong shared this view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

After the [[First World War]] (1914&amp;ndash;1918), the teaching of [[creation and evolution in public education]] grew as a public controversy. By this time, many texts taught the theory of evolution as scientific fact. Many Christians in the U.S.A. and later Jews and Muslims, expressed concern that in teaching evolution as fact, the State was unconstitutionally infringing on their right to the free exercise of religion, as in their opinion this taught their children that the Bible had been proven false.

For example, the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] politician [[William Jennings Bryan]] "became convinced that the teaching of Evolution as a fact caused the students to lose faith in the Bible, first, in the story of creation, and later in other doctrines, which underlie the Christian religion."&lt;ref&gt;''William Jennings Bryan'', W. C. Williams, Putnam, New York, 1936, p. 448&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.vt.edu/Barrow/Hist3706/readings/numbers.html ''Creationism in 20th-Century America''],
Ronald L. Numbers, Science 218 (5 November 1982): 538-544&lt;/ref&gt;

During the First World War, reports of horrors committed by [[Imperial Germany|Germans]], who were citizens of one of the most scientifically advanced countries in the World, led Bryan to state "The same science that manufactured poisonous gases to suffocate soldiers is preaching that man has a brute ancestry and eliminating the miraculous and the supernatural from the Bible."

A popular book published in 1917 by Stanford University professor and entomologist [[Vernon Lyman Kellogg|Vernon L. Kellogg]] entitled ''Headquarters Nights'',&lt;ref&gt;First published in ''Atlantic Monthly in 1917&lt;/ref&gt; drew a direct association between German war ideology and Darwinian description of nature as a struggle. Kellogg was a leading authority on evolution of insects, and had published ''Darwinism Today'' in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/chronob/KELL1867.htm |title=Chrono-Biographical Sketch - Vernon L. Kellogg |publisher=Wku.edu |date=1937-08-08 |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; His anti-Darwinian and anti-German rhetoric in ''Headquarters Nights'' influenced biologists who tried to play down the negative implications of "[[survival of the fittest]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/233422 ''Evolution as Gospel: William Patten, the Language of Democracy, and the Great War''], Gregg Mitman, Isis, Vol. 81, No. 3 (Sep., 1990), pp. 446-463&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Kidd]]'s 1918 book ''Science of Power'', claimed that there were historical and philosophical connections between Darwinism and German militarism.&lt;ref&gt;''Defender of The Faith William Jennings Bryan'', L. W. Levine, (Oxford Univ. Press. New York, 1965) pp. 261-265&lt;/ref&gt; This book and others around this time had an effect on many people.

In 1922, William Jennings Bryan published ''In His Image'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/2/7/4/12744/12744-8.txt |title=In His Image by William Jennings Bryan - Project Gutenberg |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2004-06-25 |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he argued that Darwinism was both irrational and immoral. On the former point, he pointed to examples such as the eye, which he argued could not be explained by Darwinian evolution. On the latter point, he argued that Darwinism advocated the policy of "scientific breeding" or [[eugenics]], by which the strong were to weed out the weak, a policy that directly contradicts the Christian doctrine of charity to the helpless.

In 1923, fundamentalist preacher and evangelist [[William Bell Riley]], known as "The Grand Old Man of Fundamentalism," founded the [[Anti-Evolution League of Minnesota]], which, in 1924, became the [[Anti-Evolution League of America]]. The organization was behind anti-evolution legislation in [[Kentucky]], where its efforts were supported by William Jennings Bryan.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, William. ''North Carolina Through Four Centuries.'' University of North Carolina Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, [[Clarence Darrow]] defended [[Nathan Leopold]] and [[Richard Loeb]] on the charge of kidnapping and killing [[Bobby Franks]]; his defense included an argument that "this terrible crime was inherent in his organism, and it came from some ancestor."

In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Harry Rimmer]] was one of the most prominent American creationists. Known as the "noisiest evangelist in America,"&lt;ref name=Teller&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwardtbabinski.us/essays/froth.html |title='&amp;#39;Essays of an Atheist'&amp;#39;, Woolsey Teller, The Truth Seeker Company, Inc, 1945, Chapter V: Froth and Fraud in Fundamentalism |publisher=Edwardtbabinski.us |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; he published many creationist tracts, debated other creationists and was involved in a famous trial known as the "Floyd-Rimmer trial" against the atheist William Floyd.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Defeats Atheism - A Story of the Famous Harry Rimmer Trial as told by Attorney for Defendant James E. Bennet'', James E. Bennet, Zondervan; Frederick Naef, Printers, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, [[G. K. Chesterton]] published [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/everlasting_man.html ''The Everlasting Man''], in which he developed and articulated many creationist ideas and criticisms of the philosophical underpinnings and perceived logical flaws of evolution.

[[File:H l mencken.jpg|thumb|right|[[H. L. Mencken]], whose nationally published coverage of the [[Scopes Trial]] referred to the town's creationist inhabitants as "yokels" and "morons," referred to assisting counsel for the prosecution as a "buffoon" and his speeches as "theologic bilge," while referring to the defense as "eloquent" and "magnificent."]]

The [[Scopes Trial]] of 1925 is perhaps the most famous court case of its kind. The [[Butler Act]] had prohibited the teaching of evolution in [[public education|public schools]] in [[Tennessee]]. [[Clarence Darrow]] was the defense counsel, and William Jennings Bryan was the prosecutor. Bryan appealed for assistance to [[George McCready Price]], [[Johns Hopkins University]] physician [[Howard A. Kelly]], physicist [[Louis T. More]], and [[Alfred W. McCann]], all of whom had written books supporting creationism. Price was away in England, Kelly and More told Bryan they considered themselves more convinced by evolution, and McCann was not interested because of Bryan's stance on [[prohibition]].&lt;ref name="Numbers2006"/&gt; Nevertheless, a schoolteacher named [[John T. Scopes]] was found guilty of teaching evolution and fined, although the case was later dismissed on a technicality.

Following up on the [[Butler Act]], antievolutionary laws were passed in [[Mississippi]] in 1926, and then in [[Arkansas]] in 1928. However, the 1928 election and the onset of the [[Great Depression|Depression]] changed the playing field. Creationists shifted their attention from state legislatures to local school boards, having substantial success. They set themselves to the tasks of "the emasculation of textbooks, the 'purging' of libraries, and above all the, continued hounding of teachers." Discussions of evolution vanished from almost all schoolbooks. By 1941, about one third of American teachers were afraid of being accused of supporting evolution.&lt;ref name="Numbers2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Gatewood, 3r., Ed., Controversy in the Twenties (Vanderbilt Univ. Press, Nashville 1969), p. 39; J. V. Grabiner and P. D. Miller Science 185, 832 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, a book by one of [[George McCready Price]]'s former students, [[Harold W. Clark]] described Price's catastrophism as "creationism" in ''Back to Creationism''.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Harold W. (1929) ''Back to Creationism'' (Angwin, Calif.: Pacific Union Press, 1929), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Previously anti-evolutionists had described themselves as being "Christian fundamentalists" "Anti-evolution" or "Anti-false science." The term creationism had previously referred to the creation of [[soul]]s for each new person, as opposed to [[traducianism]], where souls were said to have been inherited from one's parents.

In 1933, a group of atheists seeking to develop a "new religion" to replace previous, deity-based religions, composed the [[Humanist Manifesto]], which outlined a fifteen-point belief system, the first two points of which provided that "Religious humanists regard the universe as self-existing and not created" and "Humanism believes that man is a part of nature and that he has emerged as a result of a continuous process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto1.html |title=Humanist Manifesto I |publisher=Americanhumanist.org |accessdate=2010-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730070437/http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto1.html |archivedate=2007-07-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This document exacerbated the ideological tone of the discussion in many circles, as many creationists came to see evolution as a doctrine of the "religion" of atheism.

In 1935, the "Religion and Science Association" was formed by a small group of creationists, led by a Wheaton College professor, to form "a unified front against the theory of evolution."&lt;ref name=CFL&gt;Christian Faith and Life 42 (1936)&lt;/ref&gt; There were three main schools of creationist thought, represented by Price, Rimmer, and tidal expert [[William Bell Dawson]]. However, since Dawson was a proponent of [[day-age creationism]] and Rimmer was ardently convinced that [[gap creationism]] was correct, the staunch supporters of a literal 6&amp;nbsp;day creation and [[young earth creationism|6000-year-old earth]] were incensed, and the organization fell apart.&lt;ref name="Numbers2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Clark to G. M. Price, 12 September 1937 (Price Papers)&lt;/ref&gt;

Price and his supporters retreated to California, and with several doctors working at the College of Medical Evangelists (now Loma Linda University), formed the "Deluge Geology Society." The "Deluge Geology Society" published the ''Bulletin of Deluge Geology and Related Science'' from 1941 to 1945. They made secret plans to unveil discoveries of fossils of human footprints that were in rock that was purportedly older than accounted for in evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;Newsletters, Creation-Deluge Society, 19 August 1944 and 17 February 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; However, again the organization foundered over disagreements about a [[young earth creationism|6000 year old earth]].&lt;ref&gt;B. F. Allen to Board of Directors of the Creation-Deluge Society, 12 August 1945 (courtesy of Molleurus Couperus).&lt;/ref&gt;

Price was particularly strident in his attacks against fellow creationists. His friend and former student [[Harold W. Clark]]  had earned a masters degree in biology from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and felt that Price's book ''New Geology'' was "entirely out of date and inadequate." Unfortunately, Price responded angrily when he found out, accusing Clark of suffering from "the modern mental disease of universityitis" and of falling in with the "tobacco-smoking, Sabbath-breaking. God-defying" evolutionists. Clark pleaded with Price that he still believed in a 6&amp;nbsp;day creation and a young earth and a universal flood, but Price responded with a vitriolic publication entitled ''Theories of Satanic Origin'' about Clark and his views.&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Numbers, Spectrum 9, 22 (January 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

The American [[George Gaylord Simpson]] argued that the paleontological record supported [[evolution]] in the 1940s. Some creationists, however, objected to his supposed equation of [[microevolution]] and [[macroevolution]], acknowledging the former but denying the latter, and continue to do so to this day.

===United States===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
The [[Second World War]] (1939&amp;ndash;1945) saw the horrors of the [[Nazi]] [[Holocaust]]. The USA creationist explanation for the Holocaust is that it had been driven in part by [[eugenics]], or the principle that individuals with "undesirable" genetic characteristics should be removed from the gene pool. Eugenics was based in part on principles of cultural evolutionary theory, though many biologists had long opposed it. Although eugenics was rejected by other nations after the war, the memory of it did not quickly fade, and professional scientists sought to distance themselves from it and other racial ideologies associated with the Nazis.

Fissures within the creationist community, which had always been present, continued to deepen as fundamentalists received advanced training in the sciences. [[Geochemist]] [[J. Laurence Kulp]] had gone to the evangelical school [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] for his undergraduate degree and was a [[Plymouth Brother]]. He obtained a PhD from [[Princeton University|Princeton]] before taking a faculty position at Columbia. He felt it was his duty to warn fellow Christians in the evangelical scientific organization the [[American Scientific Affiliation]] (ASA) of the problems with Price's claims. Kulp wrote a review of Price's work, in which he stated that "major propositions of the theory are contradicted by established physical and chemical laws" in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asa3.org/aSA/PSCF/1950/JASA3-50Kulp.html |title=Science in Christian Perspective |publisher=Asa3.org |date=1946-04-01 |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused substantial consternation among his fellow members of the [[American Scientific Affiliation]] (ASA), an affiliation of Christians who are also scientists, causing many to claim that Kulp had been contaminated with "the orthodox geological viewpoint" and this was responsible for his faith in the Bible being badly shaken.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Kulp, J. Am. Sci.20 (June 1949); J. L. Kulp J. Am. Sci. 2, 1 (No. 1) (1950); J. L. Kulp, J. Am. Sci. 2, 2 (June 1950); Page 304 of "The Creationists" by R.L. Numbers, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Kulp's influence, however, continues today within the [[American Scientific Affiliation]], which continues to support [[old earth creationism]].

In the 1950s the [[United States]] slid into a [[Cold War]] with the [[communism|communist]] [[Soviet Union]], its former ally. Communism had as one of its principles [[atheism]]. Americans divided over the issues of [[Communism and atheism]], but with the [[Great Purge]], [[Cultural Revolution]] and [[1956 Hungarian Uprising]], many became concerned about the implications of Communism and atheism. At the same time, the scientific community was making great strides in developing the theory of evolution, which seemed to make belief in God unreasonable under [[Occam's razor]]. The American shock and panic about the 1957 [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]] launch led to the passage of the [[National Defense Education Act]] in 1958 to reform American science curricula. This resulted in the [[Biological Sciences Curriculum Study]], also begun in 1958 and with the goal of writing new up-to-date biology textbooks. These new biology textbooks included a discussion of the theory of evolution. Within a few years, half of American schools were using the new BSCS biology textbooks. In addition, the hundredth anniversary of the publication of ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' was in 1959, and this sparked renewed public interest in [[evolutionary biology]]. The creationist fervor of the past seemed like ancient history. A historian at [[Oklahoma]]'s [[Northeastern State University]], R. Halliburton, even made a prediction in 1964 that "a renaissance of the [creationist] movement is most unlikely."&lt;ref&gt;R. Halliburton, Jr., Arkansas Hist. Q. 23, 283 (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, [[Henry M. Morris]] and [[John C. Whitcomb, Jr]] published a book entitled ''The Genesis Flood,'' in an effort to provide a scientific basis for [[young earth creationism]] and [[Flood geology]]. Morris had published several books previously, but none had the impact that ''The Genesis Flood''  did. Its publication resulted in ten like-minded creationists forming the [[Creation Research Society]] in 1963, and the [[Institute for Creation Research]] in 1972.

In 1968, the [[US Supreme Court]] ruled in [[Epperson vs. Arkansas]] that forbidding the teaching of evolution violated the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[US constitution]]. This clause lays out the [[Separation of church and state in the United States]] and states that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or restricting the free exercise thereof."

In 1970, creationists in California established the [[Institute for Creation Research]], to "meet the need for an organization devoted to research, publication, and teaching in those fields of science particularly relevant to the study of origins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icr.org/abouticr/history.htm |title=Discover ICR |publisher=Icr.org |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, a famous anti-young earth creationist essay by the evolutionary biologist [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] was published in the ''[[American Biology Teacher]]'' entitled ''[[Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dobzhansky | first1 = T.G. | year = 1973 | title = Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution | url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.525.3586&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf| journal = American Biology Teacher | volume = 35 | issue = 3| pages = 125–129 | doi = 10.2307/4444260 | citeseerx=10.1.1.525.3586}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that [[evolution]] was not incompatible with a belief in [[God]] nor a belief in the accuracy of scriptures.

In 1975, in [[Daniel v. Waters]], the U.S. Sixth Circuit of Appeals struck down [[Tennessee]]'s "[[equal time]]" bill.

In 1978 the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy developed the [[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy]], which denies "that scientific hypotheses about earth history may properly be used to overturn the teaching of Scripture on creation and the flood."

In 1980, [[Walt Brown (creationist)|Walt Brown]] became director of the [[Center for Scientific Creation]].

In 1981, the [[San Diego]] based fundamentalist group the [[Creation Science Research Center]] claimed, in a trial dubbed the "Monkey Trial Replay," that teaching evolution as the sole theory of development violated the rights of children who believed in biblical creation. In his opening statement for the group lawyer Richard Turner argued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is not a showdown at high noon between creation and evolution. It is not religion versus science. We are not trying to sneak the Bible into the classroom, or any other religious doctrine. The real issue here is that of religious freedom under the United States Constitution.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Turner went on to explain that the plaintiffs were seeking protection for the belief that "God created man as man, not as a blob." ''The Times'' of 7 March 1981 reported that some were of the opinion that the case was "a signal of things to come, with more and more fundamentalist groups trying to flex their not inconsiderable influence in schools across the country." At the same time [[Frank D. White]], the Governor of [[Arkansas]] signed a Bill requiring that creation science and the theory of evolution be given equal weight in schools. Although fifteen states attempted to introduce such Bills around this time, only that in Arkansas made it into law. Following hearings in [[Little Rock]] the law was overturned by Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] early in 1982, just as a similar (and equally unsuccessful) Bills were approved by legislators in [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]].

[[Carl Baugh]] established the Creation Evidence Museum in [[Glen Rose, Texas]] in 1984. [[Kent Hovind]]'s Young Earth Creationist ministry was founded in 1989.

In 1986, another creationist organization called "Reasons to Believe" was established. Unlike most current creationist organizations, RTB supports [[Old Earth creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reasons.org/about/index.shtml |title=Reasons To Believe: About RTB |publisher=Reasons.org |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the US Supreme Court again ruled, this time in [[Edwards v. Aguillard]], that requiring the teaching of "[[creation science]]" every time evolution was taught illegally advanced a particular religion, although a variety of views on origins could be taught in public schools if shown to have a basis in science. The court gave a clear definition of science, and further ruled that so-called "creation science" was simply creationism wrongly using a contrived dualism to assert that any evidence against evolution would prove Creation. Later that year, drafts of the creation science school textbook ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'' were revised to change all references to "creation" to relate to "[[intelligent design]]."&lt;ref name=bfkitz&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day6am2.html#day6am889 Barbara Forrest's testimony] at [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]. Retrieved 2007-05-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the [[Foundation for Thought and Ethics]] published ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'' by [[Percival Davis]] and [[Dean H. Kenyon]], editor [[Charles Thaxton]], with the definition that "Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency, with their distinctive features already intact. Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, wings, etc."&lt;ref name=bfkitz/&gt; The publisher got church groups and Christian radio to campaign for state textbook approval, with a petition in [[Alabama]] urging that "Intelligent Design" be presented as an alternative to evolution, and their attorney arguing that it did not compel belief in the supernatural and was not a creationist text.&lt;ref&gt;Brande, Scott (January–February 1990): [http://ncse.com/ncser/10/1/science-text-adoptions-alabama-part-ii Science Text Adoptions in Alabama Part II] NCSE Resource&lt;/ref&gt; After setbacks it focussed efforts "outside the schools" to prompt grass-roots activity from local school boards, teacher's groups and parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/ncser/10/4/foundation-thought-ethics Thomas, The Foundation for Thought and Ethics], Thomas, John A. (July–August 1990), NCSE Reports, 10(4), pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, law professor [[Phillip E. Johnson]] set out his argument that the [[scientific method|ground rules of science]] as presented at Edwards v. Aguillard unfairly disqualified creationist explanations by excluding the supernatural,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arn.org/docs/johnson/pjdogma1.htm Evolution as Dogma: The Establishment of Naturalism, Phillip E. Johnson, "A Reply to My Critics"] October 1990&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1991, he brought out a book entitled ''[[Darwin on Trial]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, P.E. (1991) ''[[Darwin on Trial]]'' {{ISBN|0-8308-1758-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenging the principles of [[Humanistic naturalism|naturalism]] and [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] in contemporary [[philosophy of science|scientific philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;November 30, 1989, Johnson, Phillip, [http://www.apologetics.org/articles/positionpaper.html "Position paper on Darwinism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612062450/http://www.apologetics.org/articles/positionpaper.html |date=2007-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1992, a symposium at [[Southern Methodist University]] in [[Dallas]] provided the public debut for a small group that included Phillip Johnson, [[Stephen C. Meyer]], [[William Dembski]], and [[Michael Behe]],&lt;ref name=bfwedge&gt;[[Barbara Forrest]], [http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Wedge.cfm#I The Wedge at Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905230611/http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Wedge.cfm |date=2014-09-05 }}.

The 1993&amp;nbsp;second edition of the school textbook ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'' added a section by Michael Behe making the argument he later called [[irreducible complexity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/rncse/24/5/design-trial-dover-pennsylvania Design on Trial in Dover, Pennsylvania] by Nicholas J Matzke, NCSE Public Information Project Specialist&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s saw the rise of [[intelligent design]], which maintains that intelligent intervention was necessary for evolution and in other ways seeks to create doubt about the validity and feasibility of [[evolution]], and to change the [[scientific method]] so that supernatural explanations are accepted.

In 1994, the court case [[Peloza v. Capistrano School District]] was decided against a teacher who claimed that his First Amendment right to free exercise of religion was violated by the school district's requirement to teach evolution.

In 1996, the [[Discovery Institute]]'s [[Center for Science and Culture]] (CSC), formerly known as the Center for Renewal of Science and Culture, was founded to promote [[Intelligent design]], and entered public discourse with the publication of ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'' by [[Michael Behe]],&lt;ref&gt;Behe, M.J. (1996) ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'' {{ISBN|0-684-83493-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing for evidence of [[Irreducible complexity]]. Critics claimed that this was a thinly veiled attempt to promote creationism, particularly in light of Edwards v. Aguillard. The Discovery Institute rejects the term creationism, which it defines narrowly as meaning [[young earth creationism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;program=CSC&amp;id=1329 |title=CSC - Intelligent Design and Creationism Just Aren't the Same |publisher=Discovery.org |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; though in court intelligent design was found to be creationism.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/2:Context]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1999 the [[Michael Polanyi Center]] was founded in the science faculty of [[Baylor University]], a Baptist college, to study intelligent design. A year later was disbanded amidst faculty complaints that the center had been established without consulting them, and would cause the school to be associated with pseudoscience.

In December 2001, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], which contained the following statement of policy, called the [[Santorum Amendment]], authored by Johnson:
:"The Conferees recognize that a quality scientific education should prepare students to distinguish the data and testable theories of science from religious or philosophical claims that are made in the name of science. Where topics are taught that may generate controversy (such as biological evolution), the curriculum should help students to understand the full range of scientific views that exist, why such topics may generate controversy, and how scientific discoveries can profoundly affect society."

In December 2001, Dembski established the [[International Society for Complexity, Information and Design]].

[[Answers In Creation]] was established in 2003 to provide answers to young earth creation organizations. They claim that the young earth position is unscientific, and through their website they claim to provide proof against young earth creation science. They are anti-young earth, and promote Christianity by endorsing old earth creationism.

In 2004 Ohio adopted education standards sympathetic to intelligent design promoted by the Discovery Institute. In February 2006 the Ohio Board of Education voted to drop the Discovery Institute's "[[Critical Analysis of Evolution]]" intelligent design lesson plan after the 2005 ruling against intelligent design in Kitzmiller v. Dover and revelations that the lesson plan was adopted despite warnings from the Ohio Department of Education, whose experts described it as wrong and misleading.

In May 2005, the [[Kansas]] school board held the [[Kansas evolution hearings]]. The court-style hearings were promoted by the Discovery Institute and attended by its Fellows and other intelligent design advocates but not by mainstream scientists, who accused it of being a [[kangaroo court]]. The result of the hearings was the adoption by the Republican-dominated board of new science standards that relied upon the Discovery Institute's Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plan employing the institute's [[Teach the Controversy]] approach, despite these having been rejected by the State Board Science Hearing Committee. With the 2006 ouster of the majority of the conservative board members, the Kansas State Board of Education approved a new curriculum that removed any reference to Intelligent Design as part of science in February 2007.

In 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania ruled on the case of [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] that intelligent design was religious in nature, a form of creationism, not scientific and thus violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The ruling barred the teaching of intelligent design in public school science classrooms for that district, but the 'Dover trial' as it came to be known, has had far-reaching effects.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time as the Kiztmiller ruling, many state legislators were considering bills promoted by the Discovery Institute supporting the teaching of intelligent design. Most were rejected in the light of the ruling in Dover trial out of what has been called the "Dover-effect."

In September 2012, [[Bill Nye]] ("[[Bill Nye The Science Guy|The Science Guy]]") warned that [[Creationism|creationist views]] threaten [[science education]] and [[innovations]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="APNews-20120924-a"&gt;{{cite news |last=Luvan |first=Dylan |title=Bill Nye Warns: Creation Views Threaten U.S. Science|url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20120924/DA1G1IKG2.html |date=September 24, 2012|publisher=[[AP News]] |accessdate=September 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Youtube-20120823"/&gt;([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHbYJfwFgOU Bill Nye video])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2202">In [[research ethics]], '''justice''' is the fair selection of research participants. Justice is the ideal distribution of risks and benefits when scientists conducting [[clinical research]] are recruiting volunteer research participants to participate in [[clinical trials]]. The concept gives guidelines on how scientific objectives and not membership in either a privileged or vulnerable population should determine which members of which communities should meet inclusion criteria to participate in research in order to most equitably share the risks and benefits of the research.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

==Defining research justice==
The most commonly recognized source for drawing attention to the importance of justice is the [[Belmont Report]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Ruth R. Faden, Tom L. Beauchamp, in collaboration with Nancy M.P.|title=A history and theory of informed consent|year=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-503686-7|pages=216|edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which used the term "justice" to describe a set of guidelines for the selection of research subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Belmont Report|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/belmont.html|work=Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research|accessdate=4 March 2012|author=The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research|date=April 18, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a critical safeguard to making clinical research ethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Emanuel | first1 = E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2939">'''Negative free bid''' is a [[contract bridge]] [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#treatment|treatment]] whereby a [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#freebid|free bid]] by responder over an opponent's overcall shows a long suit in a weak hand and is not forcing. This is in contrast with standard treatment, where a free bid can show unlimited values and is unconditionally forcing. The treatment is a relatively recent invention, and has become quite popular, especially in expert circles.

Negative free bids resolve relatively frequent situations where the responder holds a long suit with which he would like to compete for a partscore, but is deprived from bidding it by opponent's overcall.

==Example==
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;"
!width="25%"|West||width="25%"|North||width="25%"|East||width="25%"|South
|- align=center
|||1{{diams}}||1{{spades}}||?
|} 
For example, if South holds:&amp;nbsp;{{BridgeHandInline|86|KJ10852|K6|532}}, partner opens 1{{Diams}} and East overcalls 1{{Spades}}, he couldn't bid 2{{Hearts}} in standard methods, as it would show 10+ [[Hand evaluation|high-card points]], and a [[negative double]] would be too off-shape. With NFB treatment in effect though, he can bid 2{{Hearts}} which the partner may pass (unless he has extra values and support, or an excellent suit of its own without tolerance for hearts).
{{clear}}
However, as a [[corollary]], negative free bids affect the scope of negative double; if the hand is suitable for "standard" forcing free bid (10-11+ points), a negative double has to be made first and the suit bid only in the next round. Thus, the negative double can be made with the following types of hand:
*A weakish hand with unbid suits (unbid major)
*A stronger hand with unbid suits
*A strong (opening bid or more) one-suited hand.
This can sometimes allow the opponents to [[preempt]] effectively. 
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;"
!width="25%"|West||width="25%"|North||width="25%"|East||width="25%"|South
|- align=center
|1{{Diams}}||1{{Hearts}}||Dbl||4{{Hearts}}
|- align=center
|?|| || ||
|} 
For example, West, holding: {{BridgeHandInline|KJ103|J8|AKQ104|J2}}, after this auction is in an awkward situation — he doesn't know whether partner has spades or not; whether South was bidding to make or to [[sacrifice (bridge)|sacrifice]] — is it correct to double, bid 4{{Spades}} or pass?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7070">'''Negative refraction''' is the name for an [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] phenomenon where [[light]] [[ray (optics)|rays]] are [[refraction|refracted]] at an [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]] in the reverse sense to that normally expected.  Such an effect can be obtained using a [[metamaterial]] which has been designed to achieve a [[negative number|negative]] value for both (electric) [[permittivity]] ε and (magnetic) [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] μ, as in such cases the material can be assigned a negative [[refractive index]]. Such materials are sometimes called "double negative" materials.

Negative refraction occurs at interfaces between materials at which one has an ordinary positive [[phase velocity]] (i.e. a positive [[refractive index]]), and the other has the more exotic negative phase velocity (a negative [[refractive index]]).

==Negative phase velocity==

Negative phase velocity (NPV) is a property of light propagation in a [[optical medium|medium]].  There are different definitions of NPV, the most common being Veselago's original proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veselago|first=Viktor G|date=1968-04-30|title=THE ELECTRODYNAMICS OF SUBSTANCES WITH SIMULTANEOUSLY NEGATIVE VALUES OF $\epsilon$ AND μ|url=http://mr.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.1070%2FPU1968v010n04ABEH003699|journal=Soviet Physics Uspekhi|volume=10|issue=4|pages=509–514|doi=10.1070/pu1968v010n04abeh003699|issn=0038-5670}}&lt;/ref&gt; of opposition of [[wavevector]] and (Abraham)  [[Poynting vector]], i.e. E×H; other common choices are opposition of [[wavevector]] to [[group velocity]], or to [[energy velocity]]. The use of "phase velocity" in the naming convention, as opposed to the perhaps more appropriate "wave vector", follows since phase velocity has the same sign as the wavevector.

A typical criterion used to determine Veselago NPV is that the dot product of the [[Poynting vector]] and wavevector is negative (i.e. that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\vec{P}\cdot\vec{k}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;); however this definition is not [[General covariance|covariant]].  Whilst this restriction is rarely of practical significance, the criterion has nevertheless been generalized into a covariant form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=M. W. McCall|doi=10.1016/j.metmat.2008.05.001|title=A Covariant Theory of Negative Phase Velocity Propagation|journal=Metamaterials|volume=2|issue=2–3|page=92|year=2008|bibcode = 2008MetaM...2...92M }}&lt;/ref&gt; For plane waves propagating in a Veselago NPV medium, the electric field, magnetic field and wave vector follow a left-hand rule, rather than the usual right-hand rule.  This gives rise to the name "left-handed (meta)materials". However, the terms left-handed and right-handed can also arise in the study of chiral media, so this terminology is best avoided.

== Negative refractive index ==
[[Image:metarefraction.svg|thumb|A comparison of refraction in a left-handed metamaterial to that in a normal material]]
[[File:Negative refraction.ogv|thumb|Video representing negative refraction of light at uniform planar interface.]]

We can choose to avoid directly considering the [[Poynting vector]] and wavevector or a propagating light field, and consider instead the response of the materials directly: that is, we consider what values of permittivity ε and permeability µ result in [[#Negative phase velocity|negative phase velocity]] (NPV).  Since both ε and µ are in general complex, their imaginary parts do not have to be negative for a passive (i.e. [[Attenuation|lossy]]) material to display negative refraction.  The most general [[Victor Veselago|Veselago]] criterion applying to ε and µ is that of Depine and [[Akhlesh Lakhtakia|Lakhtakia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = R. A. Depine and A. Lakhtakia |doi = 10.1002/mop.20127 |title = A new condition to identify isotropic dielectric-magnetic materials displaying negative phase velocity |journal = [[Microwave and Optical Technology Letters]] |volume = 41 |issue = 4 |pages = 315–316 |year = 2004 |arxiv = physics/0311029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although other less general forms exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = P. Kinsler and M. W. McCall |doi = 10.1002/mop.23489 |title = Criteria for negative refraction in active and passive media |journal = [[Microwave and Optical Technology Letters]] |volume = 50 |issue = 7 |page = 1804 |year = 2008 |arxiv = 0806.1676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Depine-Lakhtakia criterion for negative phase velocity is

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_r|\mu|+ \mu_r |\epsilon| &lt; 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_r, \mu_r&lt;/math&gt; are the real valued parts of ε and µ, respectively. However, negative refraction (negative refractive index) and negative phase velocity can be distinct from each other, even in passive materials,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mackay|first=Tom G.|last2=Lakhtakia|first2=Akhlesh|date=2009-06-12|title=Negative refraction, negative phase velocity, and counterposition in bianisotropic materials and metamaterials|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.79.235121|journal=Physical Review B|volume=79|issue=23|pages=235121|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.79.235121}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also in active materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = J. Skaar |doi = 10.1364/OL.31.003372 |title = On resolving the refractive index and the wave vector |journal = [[Optics Letters]] |volume = 31 |issue = 22 |pages = 3372–3374 |year = 2006 |arxiv = physics/0607104 |bibcode = 2006OptL...31.3372S |citeseerx = 10.1.1.261.8030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, the [[refractive index]] ''n'' is determined using &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle n =\pm\sqrt{\epsilon\mu}&lt;/math&gt;, where by convention the positive square root is chosen for ''n''.  However, in NPV materials, we reverse that convention and pick the negative sign to mimic the fact that the wavevector (and hence phase velocity) are likewise reversed.  Strictly speaking, the refractive index is a derived quantity telling us how the wavevector is related to the optical frequency and propagation direction of the light, thus the sign of ''n'' must be chosen to match the physical situation.

==Refraction==
The principal symptom of negative refraction is just that – light rays are 
refracted on the ''same'' side of the normal on entering the material, as indicated in the diagram, and by a suitably general form of [[Snell's law]].

A '''neural circuit''', is a population of [[neuron]]s interconnected by [[synapse]]s to carry out a specific function when activated.&lt;ref name="Neuro"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Purves |first1=Dale |title=Neuroscience |date=2011 |publisher=Sinauer |location=Sunderland, Mass. |isbn=9780878936953 |page=507 |edition= 5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neural circuits interconnect to one another to form [[large scale brain networks]].&lt;ref name="CEI"&gt;{{cite web |title=Neural Circuits {{!}} Centre of Excellence for Integrative Brain Function |url=https://www.brainfunction.edu.au/research/research-themes/neural-circuits/ |website=Centre of Excellence for Integrative Brain Function |accessdate=4 June 2018 |language=en-AU |date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological [[neural network]]s have inspired the design of [[artificial neural network]]s.

Early treatments of neural [[Biological network|networks]] can be found in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ''Principles of Psychology'', 3rd edition (1872), [[Theodor Meynert]]'s ''[[Psychiatry]]'' (1884), [[William James]]' ''Principles of [[Psychology]]'' (1890), and [[Sigmund Freud]]'s Project for a Scientific Psychology (composed 1895).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://psych.stanford.edu/~jlm/papers/ThomasMcCIPCambEncy.pdf | title =Connectionist models of cognition |author1=Michael S.

Thus, Hebbian pairing of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic activity can substantially alter the dynamic characteristics of the synaptic connection and therefore either facilitate or inhibit [[neurotransmission|signal transmission]]. In 1959, the [[neuroscience|neuroscientists]], [[Warren Sturgis McCulloch]] and [[Walter Pitts]] published the first works on the processing of neural networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = What the frog's eye tells the frog's brain. |author1=J. Y. Lettvin |author2=H. R. Maturana |author3=W. S. McCulloch |author4=W. H. Pitts | year = 1959 | work = Proc. Inst. Radio Engr. | issue = 47 | pages = 1940–1951 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They showed theoretically that networks of artificial neurons could [[implementation|implement]] [[logic]]al, [[arithmetic]], and [[symbol]]ic functions. Simplified [[Biological neuron model|models of biological neurons]] were set up, now usually called [[perceptrons]] or [[artificial neurons]]. These simple models accounted for [[Summation (Neurophysiology)|neural summation]] (i.e., potentials at the post-synaptic membrane will summate in the [[cell body]]). Later models also provided for excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission.

The connections between neurons in the brain are much more complex than those of the [[artificial neuron]]s used in the [[connectionism|connectionist]] neural computing models of [[artificial neural network]]s. The basic kinds of connections between neurons are [[synapse]]s, [[chemical synapse|chemical]] and [[electrical synapse]]s.

The establishment of synapses enables the connection of neurons into millions of overlapping, and interlinking neural circuits. [[Neurexin]]s are central to this process.&lt;ref name="Sudhof"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Südhof |first1=TC |title=Synaptic Neurexin Complexes: A Molecular Code for the Logic of Neural Circuits. |journal=Cell |date=2 November 2017 |volume=171 |issue=4 |pages=745–769 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.024 |pmid=29100073|pmc=5694349 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One principle by which neurons work is [[Summation (neurophysiology)|neural summation]] – [[postsynaptic potential|potentials]] at the [[Chemical synapse|postsynaptic membrane]] will sum up in the cell body. If the [[depolarization]] of the neuron at the axon goes above threshold an action potential will occur that travels down the axon to the terminal endings to transmit a signal to other neurons. Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission is realized mostly by [[inhibitory postsynaptic potentials]] (IPSPs) and [[excitatory postsynaptic potentials]] (EPSPs).

On the [[electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] level, there are various phenomena which alter the response characteristics of individual synapses (called [[synaptic plasticity]]) and individual neurons ([[intrinsic plasticity]]). These are often divided into short-term plasticity and long-term plasticity. Long-term synaptic plasticity is often contended to be the most likely [[memory]] substrate. Usually the term "[[neuroplasticity]]" refers to changes in the brain that are caused by activity or experience.

Connections display temporal and spatial characteristics. Temporal characteristics refer to the continuously modified activity-dependent efficacy of synaptic transmission, called [[spike-timing-dependent plasticity]]. It has been observed in several studies that the synaptic efficacy of this transmission can undergo short-term increase (called [[neural facilitation|facilitation]]) or decrease ([[Neural facilitation#Short-term depression|depression]]) according to the activity of the presynaptic neuron. The induction of long-term changes in synaptic efficacy, by [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP) or [[long-term depression|depression]] (LTD), depends strongly on the relative timing of the onset of the [[excitatory postsynaptic potential]] and the postsynaptic action potential. LTP is induced by a series of action potentials which cause a variety of biochemical responses. Eventually, the reactions cause the expression of new receptors on the cellular membranes of the postsynaptic neurons or increase the efficacy of the existing receptors through [[phosphorylation]].

Backpropagating action potentials cannot occur because after an action potential travels down a given segment of the axon, the [[Depolarizing pre-pulse#Hodgkin–Huxley model|m gate]]s on [[voltage-gated sodium channel]]s close, thus blocking any transient opening of the [[Depolarizing pre-pulse#Hodgkin–Huxley model|h gate]] from causing a change in the intracellular sodium ion (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) concentration, and preventing the generation of an action potential back towards the cell body. In some cells, however, [[neural backpropagation]] does occur through the [[dendrite|dendritic branching]] and may have important effects on synaptic plasticity and computation.

A neuron in the brain requires a single signal to a neuromuscular junction to stimulate contraction of the postsynaptic muscle cell. In the spinal cord, however, at least 75 [[afferent nerve|afferent]] neurons are required to produce firing. This picture is further complicated by variation in time constant between neurons, as some cells can experience their [[Excitatory postsynaptic potential|EPSPs]] over a wider period of time than others.

While in synapses in the [[development of the human brain|developing brain]] synaptic depression has been particularly widely observed it has been speculated that it changes to facilitation in adult brains.

==Circuitry==
An example of a neural circuit is the [[trisynaptic circuit]] in the [[hippocampus]]. Another is the [[Papez circuit]] linking the [[hypothalamus]] to the [[limbic lobe]]. There are several neural circuits in the [[cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop]]. These circuits carry information between the cortex, [[basal ganglia]], thalamus, and back to the cortex. The largest structure within the basal ganglia, the [[striatum]], is seen as having its own internal microcircuitry.&lt;ref name="Stocco"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stocco |first1=Andrea |last2=Lebiere |first2=Christian |last3=Anderson |first3=John R. |title=Conditional Routing of Information to the Cortex: A Model of the Basal Ganglia's Role in Cognitive Coordination |journal=Psychological Review |volume=117 |issue=2 |pages=541–74 |year=2010 |pmid=20438237 |doi=10.1037/a0019077 |pmc=3064519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neural circuits in the [[spinal cord]] called [[central pattern generator]]s are responsible for controlling motor instructions involved in rhythmic behaviours. Rhythmic behaviours include walking, [[urination]], and [[ejaculation]]. The central pattern generators are made up of different groups of [[spinal interneuron]]s.&lt;ref name="Guertin"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guertin |first1=PA |title=Central pattern generator for locomotion: anatomical, physiological, and pathophysiological considerations. |journal=Frontiers in Neurology |date=2012 |volume=3 |pages=183 |doi=10.3389/fneur.2012.00183 |pmid=23403923|pmc=3567435 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study methods==
{{See also|Neuropsychology|Cognitive neuropsychology}}
Different [[neuroimaging]] techniques have been developed to investigate the activity of neural circuits and networks. The use of "brain scanners" or functional neuroimaging to investigate the structure or function of the brain is common, either as simply a way of better assessing brain injury with high resolution pictures, or by examining the relative activations of different brain areas. Such technologies may include [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[brain positron emission tomography]] (brain PET), and [[computed axial tomography]] (CAT) scans. [[Functional neuroimaging]] uses specific brain imaging technologies to take scans from the brain, usually when a person is doing a particular task, in an attempt to understand how the activation of particular brain areas is related to the task. In functional neuroimaging, especially fMRI, which measures [[hemodynamic response|hemodynamic activity]] (using [[Blood-oxygen-level dependent imaging|BOLD-contrast imaging]]) which is closely linked to neural activity, PET, and [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) is used.

[[Connectionism|Connectionist]] models serve as a test platform for different hypotheses of representation, information processing, and signal transmission. Lesioning studies in such models, e.g. [[artificial neural network]]s, where parts of the nodes are deliberately destroyed to see how the network performs, can also yield important insights in the working of several cell assemblies. Similarly, simulations of dysfunctional neurotransmitters in neurological conditions (e.g., dopamine in the basal ganglia of [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] patients) can yield insights into the underlying mechanisms for patterns of cognitive deficits observed in the particular patient group. Predictions from these models can be tested in patients or via pharmacological manipulations, and these studies can in turn be used to inform the models, making the process iterative.

==Clinical significance==
Sometimes neural circuitries can become pathological and cause problems such as in [[Parkinson's disease]] when the [[basal ganglia]] are involved.&lt;ref name="French"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=French |first1=IT |last2=Muthusamy |first2=KA |title=A Review of the Pedunculopontine Nucleus in Parkinson's Disease. |journal=Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience |date=2018 |volume=10 |pages=99 |doi=10.3389/fnagi.2018.00099 |pmid=29755338|pmc=5933166 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems in the [[Papez circuit]] can also give rise to a number of [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative disorders]] including Parkinson's.

"'''Ought implies can'''" is an ethical formula ascribed to [[Immanuel Kant]] that claims an agent, if morally obliged to perform a certain action, must logically be able to perform it: {{quote|For if the moral law commands that we ought to be better human beings now, it inescapably follows that we must be capable of being better human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Religion Within the Boundaries of Mere Reason''. 6:50. p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote|The action to which the "ought" applies must indeed be possible under natural conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Critique of Pure Reason''. A548/B576. p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kant believed this principle was a [[Categorical imperative#Freedom and autonomy|categorical freedom]], bound only by the [[free will]] as opposed to the [[David Hume|Humean]] hypothetical freedom ("Free to do otherwise if I had so chosen").&lt;ref&gt;"Ought implies can". The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy. Bunnin, Nicholas and Yu, Jiyuan (eds). Blackwell Publishing. 2004. Blackwell Reference Online. 4 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several ways of deriving the formula—for example, the argument that it is wrong to blame people for things that they cannot control (essentially phrasing the formula as the contrapositive "'cannot' implies 'has no duty to'").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Robert|last=Stern|title=Does 'Ought' Imply 'Can'? And Did Kant Think It Does?|journal=[[Utilitas]]|volume=16|issue=1|pages=42–61|year=2004|doi=10.1017/S0953820803001055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Outrage porn''' refers to any type of media that is designed to evoke [[Outrage (emotion)|outrage]] for the purpose getting traffic or attention online.

==Overview==
Outrage porn is a term used to explain media that is created not in order to generate sympathy, but rather to cause anger or outrage among its consumers. It is characterized by insincere rage, umbrage and indignation.&lt;ref name="NYO1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leibovich, Mark [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/magazine/fake-outrage-in-the-kentucky-senate-race.html?_r=0 Fake Outrage in Kentucky] ''New York Times''. September 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Media outlets are often incentivized to feign outrage because it specifically triggers many of the most lucrative online behaviors, including leaving comments, repeat pageviews and social sharing, which the outlets capitalize on.&lt;ref&gt;Holiday, Ryan [http://observer.com/2014/10/rage-profiteers-how-blogs-harness-our-anger-for-their-own-gain/ Rage Profiteers: How Bloggers Harness Our Anger For Their Own Gain] ''New York Observer''.

Jonah Berger, a professor of marketing at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] conducted a study on the spreadability of emotions via social media and concluded that, "Anger is a high-arousal emotion, which drives people to take action...It makes you feel fired up, which makes you more likely to pass things on.”&lt;ref&gt;Shaer, Matthew [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-emotion-goes-viral-fastest-180950182/?no-ist What Emotion Goes Viral the Fastest?] ''Smithsonian Magazine'', September 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, online audiences may be susceptible to outrage porn in part because of their feeling of powerlessness to managers, politicians, creditors and celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Geoff [http://www.syracuse.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/03/rooney_mara_pan_tiger_lily_outrage_native_americans.html Rooney Mara to play Tiger Lily in new 'Pan' movie? Outrage is all the rage nowadays] ''Syracuse Post-Standard''. September 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Kreider makes a distinction between authentic outrage and outrage porn by stating, "I’m not saying that all outrage is inherently irrational, that we should all just calm down, that It’s All Good. All is not good...Outrage is healthy to the extent that it causes us to act against injustice.&lt;ref name="COINED1" /&gt;

In [[engineering]], some methods or components make special demands on the system.  The extra design features necessary to accommodate these demands are called '''overhead'''. For instance, in [[electrical engineering]], a particular [[integrated circuit]] might draw large [[electric current|current]], requiring a robust power delivery circuit and a heat-dissipation mechanism.

== Example ==
An example from [[software engineering]] is the [[encoding]] of information and data. The date and time ''"2011-07-12 07:18:47"'' can be expressed as [[Unix time]] with the 32-bit [[Signedness|signed]] [[integer]] &lt;code&gt;1310447927&lt;/code&gt;, consuming only 4 [[byte]]s. Represented as [[ISO 8601]] formatted [[UTF-8]] encoded [[String literal|string]] &lt;code&gt;2011-07-12 07:18:47&lt;/code&gt; the date would consume 19 bytes, a size overhead of 375% over the binary integer representation. As [[XML]] this date can be written as follows with an overhead of 218 characters, while adding the semantic context that it is a CHANGEDATE with index 1.
&lt;code&gt;
 &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
 &lt;DATETIME qualifier="CHANGEDATE" index="1"&gt;
     &lt;YEAR&gt;2011&lt;/YEAR&gt;
     &lt;MONTH&gt;07&lt;/MONTH&gt;
     &lt;DAY&gt;12&lt;/DAY&gt;
     &lt;HOUR&gt;07&lt;/HOUR&gt;
     &lt;MINUTE&gt;18&lt;/MINUTE&gt;
     &lt;SECOND&gt;47&lt;/SECOND&gt;
 &lt;/DATETIME&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
The 349 bytes resulting from the UTF-8 encoded XML correspond to a size overhead of 8625% over the original integer representation.

[[File:Igreja de Campanha Azulejo 4.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Tile|Tilings]], such as these from [[:pt:Igreja de Campanhã|Igreja de Campanhã]], Porto, [[Portugal]], are visual patterns used for decoration.]]

A '''pattern''' is a regularity in the world, man-made design, or abstract ideas. As such, the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner. A '''geometric pattern''' is a kind of pattern formed of [[geometry|geometric]] [[shape]]s and typically repeated like a [[wallpaper]] design.

Any of the [[sense]]s may directly observe patterns. Conversely, abstract patterns in [[science]], [[mathematics]], or [[language]] may be observable only by analysis. Direct observation in practice means seeing visual patterns, which are widespread in nature and in art. Visual [[patterns in nature]] are often [[Chaos theory|chaotic]], never exactly repeating, and often involve [[fractals]]. Natural patterns include [[spirals]], [[meander]]s, [[wave]]s, [[foam]]s, [[tessellation|tilings]], [[fracture|cracks]], and those created by [[Symmetry|symmetries]] of [[rotation symmetry|rotation]] and [[reflection symmetry|reflection]]. Patterns have an underlying [[Mathematics|mathematical]] structure;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, 2001. Page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, mathematics can be seen as the search for regularities, and the output of any function is a mathematical pattern. Similarly in the sciences, theories explain and predict regularities in the world.

In art and architecture, decorations or [[Motif (visual arts)|visual motifs]] may be combined and repeated to form patterns designed to have a chosen effect on the viewer. In computer science, a [[software design pattern]] is a known solution to a class of problems in programming. In fashion, the pattern is a [[Die (manufacturing)|template]] used to create any number of similar garments.

== Nature ==
{{main|Patterns in nature}}

Nature provides examples of many kinds of pattern, including [[symmetry|symmetries]], trees and other structures with a [[fractal]] dimension, [[spirals]], [[meander]]s, [[wave]]s, [[foam]]s, [[tessellation|tilings]], [[fracture|cracks]] and stripes.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Peter. ''Patterns in Nature'', 1974. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symmetry ===

[[File:Schnee1.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Snowflake]] [[dihedral symmetry|sixfold symmetry]]]]

Symmetry is widespread in living things. Animals that move usually have bilateral or [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]] as this favours movement.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Ian. 2001. Pages 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Plants often have radial or [[rotational symmetry]], as do many flowers, as well as animals which are largely static as adults, such as [[sea anemone]]s. Fivefold symmetry is found in the [[echinoderms]], including [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Ian. 2001. Pages 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among non-living things, [[snowflake]]s have striking [[dihedral symmetry|sixfold symmetry]]: each flake is unique, its structure recording the varying conditions during its crystallisation similarly on each of its six arms.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Ian. 2001. Page 52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crystal]]s have a highly specific set of possible [[crystal habit|crystal symmetries]]; they can be cubic or octahedral, but cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike [[quasicrystals]]).&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Ian. 2001.

Spiral patterns are found in the body plans of animals including [[molluscs]] such as the [[nautilus]], and in the [[phyllotaxis]] of many plants, both of leaves spiralling around stems, and in the multiple spirals found in flowerheads such as the [[sunflower]] and fruit structures like the [[pineapple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.scipress.org/journals/forma/pdf/1904/19040335.pdf | title=Growth in Plants: A Study in Number | author=Kappraff, Jay | journal=Forma | year=2004 | volume=19 | pages=335–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Waves, dunes ===
[[File:Sand dune ripples.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Dune]] [[Capillary wave|ripple]]]]

[[Wave]]s are disturbances that carry energy as they move. [[Mechanical wave]]s propagate through a medium – air or water, making it [[Oscillation|oscillate]] as they pass by.&lt;ref&gt;French, A.P. ''Vibrations and Waves''. Nelson Thornes, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind wave]]s are [[surface wave]]s that create the chaotic patterns of the sea. As they pass over sand, such waves create patterns of ripples; similarly, as the wind passes over sand, it creates patterns of [[dune]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=H.L. | last=Tolman | contribution=Practical wind wave modeling | title=CBMS Conference Proceedings on Water Waves: Theory and Experiment | year=2008 | location=Howard University, USA, 13–18 May 2008 | publisher=World Scientific Publ. | url=http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/mmab/papers/tn270/Howard_08.pdf | editor-first=M.F. | editor-last=Mahmood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bubbles, foam ===

=== Cracks ===
[[File:Cracked earth in the Rann of Kutch.jpg|thumb|75px|Shrinkage [[Fracture|Cracks]]]]

[[Fracture|Crack]]s form in materials to relieve stress: with 120 degree joints in elastic materials, but at 90 degrees in inelastic materials. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not. Cracking patterns are widespread in nature, for example in rocks, mud, tree bark and the glazes of old paintings and ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Peter. 1974. Page 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tilings ===
{{further|Tessellation|Tile}}

In visual art, pattern consists in regularity which in some way "organizes surfaces or structures in a consistent, regular manner." At its simplest, a pattern in art may be a geometric or other repeating shape in a [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[tapestry]], ceramic [[Tile|tiling]] or [[carpet]], but a pattern need not necessarily repeat exactly as long as it provides some form or organizing "skeleton" in the artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://char.txa.cornell.edu/language/element/pattern/pattern.htm | title=Art, Design, and Visual Thinking | publisher=Cornell University | work=Pattern | year=1995 | accessdate=12 December 2012 | author=Jirousek, Charlotte}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mathematics, a [[tessellation]] is the tiling of a plane using one or more geometric shapes (which mathematicians call tiles), with no overlaps and no gaps.&lt;ref name=Grunbaum&gt;{{cite book|last=Grünbaum|first=Branko|title=Tilings and Patterns|year=1987|publisher=W.

[[Image:Hampi1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Patterns in architecture: the Virupaksha temple at Hampi has a [[fractal]]-like structure where the parts resemble the whole.]]
{{main|Pattern (architecture)|Mathematics and architecture}}

In architecture, [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] are repeated in various ways to form patterns. Most simply, structures such as windows can be repeated horizontally and vertically (see leading picture). Architects can use and repeat decorative and structural elements such as [[column]]s, [[pediment]]s, and [[lintel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of Western Art | publisher=McGraw Hill | author=Adams, Laurie | year=2001 | page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repetitions need not be identical; for example, temples in South India have a roughly pyramidal form, where elements of the pattern repeat in a [[fractal]]-like way at different sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Heaven's Fractal Net: Retrieving Lost Visions in the Humanities | publisher=Indiana University Press | author=Jackson, William Joseph | year=2004 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science and mathematics ==
[[File:Fractal fern explained.png|thumb|upright|Fractal model of a fern illustrating [[self-similar]]ity]]

[[Mathematics]] is sometimes called the "Science of Pattern", in the sense of rules that can be applied wherever needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2214851?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101539380483 | title=Mathematics as a Science of Patterns: Ontology and Reference | author=Resnik, Michael D. | journal=Noûs |date=November 1981 | volume=15 | issue=4 | pages=529–550 | doi=10.2307/2214851}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, any [[sequence]] of numbers that may be modeled by a mathematical function can be considered a pattern. Mathematics can be taught as a collection of patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.coas.howard.edu/mathematics/faculty/bayne/patterns.html | title=MATH 012 Patterns in Mathematics - spring 2012 | year=2012 | accessdate=16 January 2013 | author=Bayne, Richard E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fractals ===

Some mathematical rule-patterns can be visualised, and among these are those that explain [[patterns in nature]] including the mathematics of symmetry, waves, meanders, and fractals. [[Fractal]]s are mathematical patterns that are scale invariant. This means that the shape of the pattern does not depend on how closely you look at it. [[Self-similarity]] is found in fractals. Examples of natural fractals are coast lines and tree shapes, which repeat their shape regardless of what magnification you view at. While self-similar patterns can appear indefinitely complex, the rules needed to describe or produce their [[pattern formation|formation]] can be simple (e.g. [[Lindenmayer system]]s describing [[tree]] shapes).&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mandelbrot |first=Benoît B. |authorlink=Benoît Mandelbrot |title=The fractal geometry of nature
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0R2LkE3N7-oC |year=1983| publisher=Macmillan
|isbn=978-0-7167-1186-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[pattern theory]], devised by [[Ulf Grenander]], mathematicians attempt to describe the world in terms of patterns. The goal is to lay out the world in a more computationally friendly manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Pattern Theory: From Representation to Inference | publisher=Oxford University Press |author1=Grenander, Ulf |author2=Miller, Michael | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the broadest sense, any regularity that can be explained by a scientific theory is a pattern. As in mathematics, science can be taught as a set of patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/smg/Website/UCP/ | title=Causal Patterns in Science | publisher=Harvard Graduate School of Education | year=2008 | accessdate=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer science ==

In computer science, a [[software design pattern]], in the sense of a [[Template method pattern|template]], is a general solution to a problem in programming. A design pattern provides a reusable architectural outline that may speed the development of many computer programs.&lt;ref&gt;Gamma et al, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fashion ==
{{main|Pattern (sewing)}}
In fashion, the pattern is a [[Die (manufacturing)|template]], a technical two-dimensional tool used to create any number of identical garments. It can be considered as a means of translating from the drawing to the real garment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Artist Centric Marketplace for Fashion Sketch Templates, Croquis &amp; More|url=https://illustratorstuff.com/|publisher=Illustrator Stuff|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9207">A '''peremptory norm''' (also called '''''jus cogens''''' or '''''ius cogens''''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|dʒ|ʌ|s|_|ˈ|k|oʊ|dʒ|ɛ|n|z|,_|ˌ|j|ʌ|s}};&lt;ref&gt;http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/jus+cogens&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin]] for "compelling law") is a fundamental principle of [[international law]] that is accepted by the international community of [[sovereign state|states]] as a [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] from which no [[derogation]] is permitted.

There is no universal agreement regarding precisely which norms are ''jus cogens'' nor how a norm reaches that status, but it is generally accepted that ''jus cogens'' includes the prohibition of [[genocide]], maritime [[piracy]], enslaving in general (to include [[slavery]] as well as the [[slave trade]]), [[torture]], [[refoulement]] and [[war of aggression|wars of aggression and territorial aggrandizement]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Cherif Bassiouni. (Autumn 1996) "International Crimes: 'Jus Cogens' and 'Obligatio Erga Omnes'." ''Law and Contemporary Problems''. Vol. 59, No. 4, Pg. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholarship has also proposed the idea of regional ''jus cogens''.&lt;ref&gt;Hasmath, Reza (2012). "[https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1366803 The Utility of Regional Jus Cogens]", Paper Presented at American Political Science Association Annual Meeting (New Orleans, USA), August 30-September 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of peremptory norms under international law==
Unlike ordinary [[Customary international law|customary law]], which has traditionally required consent and allows the alteration of its obligations between states through [[treaty|treaties]], peremptory norms cannot be violated by any state "through international treaties or local or special customs or even general customary rules not endowed with the same normative force".&lt;ref&gt;Prosecutor v. Furundzija, International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, 2002, 121 ''International Law Reports'' 213 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions of the necessity of such norms could be traced as far as 1758 (Emmerich de Vattel, Droit des gens) and 1764 (Christian Wolff, Jus Gentium), clearly rooting from principles of [[natural law]].&lt;ref&gt;Władysław Czapliński. Jus Cogens and the Law of Treaties. In C. Tomuschat and J. M. Thouvenin (eds). 2006. The Fundamental Rules of the International Legal Order. Netherlands: Koninklijke Brill NV, pp. 83–98&lt;/ref&gt;

But it was the judgments of the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] that indicate the existence of such a peremptory norm.  In the [http://www.icj-cij.org/pcij/serie_A/A_01/03_Wimbledon_Arret_08_1923.pdf Wimbledon Case] in 1923, not mentioning peremptory norms explicitly but stating how state sovereignty is not inalienable.&lt;ref&gt;Cherif Bassiouni. 2011. Crimes Against Humanity: Historical Evolution and Contemporary Application. New York: Cambridge University Press, p. 266, see also Wimbledon Case, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Article 53 of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], any treaty that conflicts with a peremptory norm is void.&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 53, May 23, 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S 331, 8 ''International Legal Materials''  679 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty allows for the emergence of new peremptory norms,&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 64, May 23, 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S 331, 8 ''International Legal Materials''  679 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; but does not specify any peremptory norms. It does mention the prohibition on the threat of use of force and on the use of coercion to conclude an agreement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A treaty is void if, at the time of its conclusion, it conflicts with a peremptory norm of general international law. For the purposes of the present Convention, a peremptory norm of general international law is a norm accepted and recognized by the international community of states as a whole as a norm from which no derogation is permitted and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law having the same character."&lt;ref&gt;U.N. Doc. A/CONF.39/27 (1969), repinted in 63 Am. J. Int'l L. 875 (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The number of peremptory norms is considered limited but not exclusively catalogued. They are not listed or defined by any authoritative body, but arise out of case law and changing social and political attitudes. Generally included are prohibitions on waging [[War of aggression|aggressive war]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]], maritime [[piracy]], [[genocide]], [[Crime of apartheid|apartheid]], [[slavery]], [[torture]]. As an example, international tribunals have held that it is impermissible for a state to acquire territory through war.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Bossuyt en Jan Wouters (2005): ''Grondlijnen van internationaal recht'', Intersentia, Antwerpen enz., p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prosecutor v. Furundžija 2002"&gt;Prosecutor v. Furundžija, International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, 2002, 121 ''International Law Reports'' 213 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the seemingly clear weight of condemnation of such practices, some critics disagree with the division of international legal norms into a hierarchy. There is also disagreement over how such norms are recognized or established. The relatively new concept of peremptory norms seems to be at odds with the traditionally consensual nature of international law considered necessary to state [[sovereignty]].

Some peremptory norms define criminal offences considered to be enforceable against not only states but also individuals. That has been increasingly accepted since the [[Nuremberg Trials]] (the first enforcement in world history of international norms upon individuals) and now might be considered uncontroversial. However, the language of peremptory norms was not used in connection with these trials, rather the basis of criminalisation and punishment of Nazi atrocities, was that civilisation could not tolerate their being ignored because it could not survive their being repeated.

There are often disagreements over whether a particular case violates a peremptory norm. As in other areas of law, states generally reserve the right to interpret the concept for themselves.

Many large states have accepted this concept. Some of them have ratified the Vienna Convention, while others have stated in their official statements that they accept the Vienna Convention as "codificatory". Some have applied the concept in their dealings with international organizations and other states.

==Examples==

===Execution of juvenile offenders===
The case of ''[[Michael Domingues v. United States]]'' provides an example of an international body's opinion that a particular norm is of a ''jus cogens'' nature. Michael Domingues had been convicted and sentenced to death in [[Nevada]], United States for two murders committed when he was 16 years old. Domingues brought the case in front of the [[Inter-American Commission of Human Rights]] which delivered a non-legally binding report.&lt;ref name="The Michael Domingues Case 2001"&gt;The Michael Domingues Case: Argument of the United States, Office of the Legal Adviser, United States Department of State, ''Digest of United States Practice in International Law 2001'', pp. 303, 310–13&lt;/ref&gt; The United States argued that there was no ''jus cogens'' norm that "establishes eighteen years as the minimum age at which an offender can receive a sentence of death".&lt;ref name="The Michael Domingues Case 2001"/&gt; The Commission concluded that there was a "''jus cogens'' norm not to impose capital punishment on individuals who committed their crimes when they had not yet reached 18 years of age."&lt;ref&gt;The Michael Domingues Case: Report on the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Report No. 62/02, Merits, Case 12.285 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has subsequently banned the execution of juvenile offenders. Although not necessarily in response to the above non-binding report, the Supreme Court cited evolving international norms as one of the reasons for the ban (''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'').

===Torture===
The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] stated in ''Prosecutor v. Furundžija'' that there is a ''jus cogens'' for the prohibition against torture.&lt;ref name="Prosecutor v. Furundžija 2002"/&gt; It also stated that every state is entitled "to investigate, prosecute and punish or extradite individuals accused of torture, who are present in a territory under its jurisdiction."&lt;ref name="Prosecutor v. Furundžija 2002"/&gt;  Therefore, there is universal jurisdiction over torture. The rationale for this is that "the torturer has become, like the pirate and the slave trader before him, ''[[hostis humani generis]]'', an enemy of all mankind."&lt;ref&gt;Janis, M. and Noyes, J. International Law": Cases and Commentary (3rd ed.), Prosecutor v. Furundžija, Page 148 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[continuum mechanics]], '''stress''' is a [[physical quantity]] that expresses the internal [[force]]s that neighboring [[particle]]s of a continuous material exert on each other, while [[deformation (mechanics)#Strain|strain]] is the measure of the deformation of the material. For example, when a [[solid]] vertical bar is supporting an overhead [[weight]], each particle in the bar pushes on the particles immediately below it. When a [[liquid]] is in a closed container under [[pressure]], each particle gets pushed against by all the surrounding particles.  The container walls and the [[pressure]]-inducing surface (such as a piston) push against them in (Newtonian) [[reaction force|reaction]]. These macroscopic forces are actually the net result of a very large number of [[intermolecular force]]s and [[statistical mechanics|collision]]s between the particles in those [[molecule]]s. Stress is frequently represented by a lowercase Greek letter sigma (σ).

Strain inside a material may arise by various mechanisms, such as ''stress'' as applied by external forces to the bulk material (like [[gravity]]) or to its surface (like [[contact force]]s, external pressure, or [[friction]]).  Any [[deformation (mechanics)|strain (deformation)]] of a solid material generates an internal ''elastic stress'', analogous to the reaction force of a [[spring (device)|spring]], that tends to restore the material to its original non-deformed state.  In liquids and [[gas]]es, only deformations that change the volume generate persistent elastic stress. However, if the deformation is gradually changing with time, even in fluids there will usually be some  ''viscous stress'', opposing that change.  Elastic and viscous stresses are usually combined under the name ''mechanical stress''.
[[File:DIFFERENT TYPES OF STRESS.png|thumb|Mechanic stress]]

Significant stress may exist even when deformation is negligible or non-existent (a common assumption when modeling the flow of water). Stress may exist in the absence of external forces; such ''built-in stress'' is important, for example, in [[prestressed concrete]] and [[tempered glass]]. Stress may also be imposed on a material without the application of [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's second law|net forces]], for example by [[thermal expansion|changes in temperature]] or [[chemistry|chemical]] composition, or by external [[electromagnetic field]]s (as in [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] and [[magnetostriction|magnetostrictive]] materials).

The relation between mechanical stress, deformation, and the [[strain rate tensor|rate of change of deformation]] can be quite complicated, although a [[linear elasticity|linear approximation]] may be adequate in practice if the quantities are small enough. Stress that exceeds certain [[strength of materials|strength limits]] of the material will result in permanent deformation (such as [[plasticity (physics)|plastic flow]], [[fracture]], [[cavitation]]) or even change its [[crystal structure]]  and [[chemistry|chemical composition]].

In some branches of [[engineering]], the term ''stress'' is occasionally used in a looser sense as a synonym of "internal force". For example, in the analysis of [[truss]]es, it may refer to the total traction or compression force acting on a beam, rather than the force divided by the area of its [[cross section (geometry)|cross-section]].

Since ancient times humans have been consciously aware of stress inside materials. Until the 17th century, the understanding of stress was largely intuitive and empirical; and yet it resulted in some surprisingly sophisticated technology, like the [[composite bow]] and [[glass blowing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=J.E.|title=Structures, or, Why things don't fall down|date=2003|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0306812835|edition=2. Da Capo Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over several millennia, architects and builders, in particular, learned how to put together carefully shaped wood beams and stone blocks to withstand, transmit, and distribute stress in the most effective manner, with ingenious devices such as the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]], [[arch]]es, [[cupola]]s, [[truss]]es and the [[flying buttress]]es of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedrals]].

Ancient and medieval architects did develop some geometrical methods and simple formulas to compute the proper sizes of pillars and beams, but the scientific understanding of stress became possible only after the necessary tools were invented in the 17th and 18th centuries: [[Galileo Galilei]]'s rigorous [[experimental method]], [[René Descartes]]'s [[Cartesian coordinates|coordinates]] and [[analytic geometry]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[Newton's laws|laws of motion and equilibrium]] and [[calculus|calculus of infinitesimals]].&lt;ref name="Lubliner" /&gt;  With those tools, [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] was able to give the first rigorous and general mathematical model for stress in a homogeneous medium.{{citation needed|date = June 2014}}  Cauchy observed that the force across an imaginary surface was a linear function of its normal vector; and, moreover, that it must be a symmetric function (with zero total momentum).{{citation needed|date = June 2014}}

The understanding of stress in liquids started with Newton, who provided a differential formula for friction forces (shear stress) in parallel [[laminar flow]].

==Overview==

=== Definition ===
Stress is defined as the force across a "small" boundary per unit area of that boundary, for all orientations of the boundary.&lt;ref name="Chen" /&gt; Being derived from a fundamental physical quantity (force) and a purely geometrical quantity (area), stress is also a fundamental quantity, like velocity, [[torque]] or [[energy]], that can be quantified and analyzed without explicit consideration of the nature of the material or of its physical causes.

Following the basic premises of continuum mechanics, stress is a [[macroscopic]] concept.  Namely, the particles considered in its definition and analysis should be just small enough to be treated as homogeneous in composition and state, but still large enough to ignore [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] effects and the detailed motions of molecules.  Thus, the force between two particles is actually the average of a very large number of atomic forces between their molecules; and physical quantities like mass, velocity, and forces that act through the bulk of three-dimensional bodies, like gravity, are assumed to be smoothly distributed over them.&lt;ref name="Chadwick" /&gt;{{rp|p.90–106}} Depending on the context, one may also assume that the particles are large enough to allow the averaging out of other microscopic features, like the grains of a [[metal]] rod or the [[fiber]]s of a piece of [[wood]].

[[File:Cmec stress defn f02 t6.png|thumb|200px|right|The stress across a surface element (yellow disk) is the force that the material on one side (top ball) exerts on the material on the other side (bottom ball), divided by the area of the surface.]]
Quantitatively, the stress is expressed by the ''Cauchy traction vector'' ''T'' defined as the traction force ''F'' between adjacent parts of the material across an imaginary separating surface ''S'', divided by the area of ''S''.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt;{{rp|p.41–50}} In a [[fluid]] at rest the force is perpendicular to the surface, and is the familiar [[hydrostatic pressure|pressure]].  In a [[solid]], or in a [[Fluid dynamics|flow]] of viscous [[liquid]], the force ''F'' may not be perpendicular to ''S''; hence the stress across a surface must be regarded a vector quantity, not a scalar. Moreover, the direction and magnitude generally depend on the orientation of ''S''.  Thus the stress state of the material must be described by a [[tensor]], called the [[Cauchy stress tensor|(Cauchy) stress tensor]]; which is a [[linear map|linear function]] that relates the [[surface normal|normal vector]] ''n'' of a surface ''S'' to the stress ''T'' across ''S''.  With respect to any chosen [[Cartesian coordinates|coordinate system]], the Cauchy stress tensor can be represented as a [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]] [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of 3×3 real numbers. Even within a [[homogeneous]] body, the stress tensor may vary from place to place, and may change over time; therefore, the stress within a material is, in general, a time-varying [[tensor field]].

=== Normal and shear stress ===
{{Further information|compression (physical)|Shear stress}}

In general, the stress ''T'' that a particle ''P'' applies on another particle ''Q'' across a surface ''S'' can have any direction relative to ''S''.  The vector ''T'' may be regarded as the sum of two components: the ''normal stress'' ([[Compression (physical)|compression]] or [[Tension (physics)|tension]]) perpendicular to the surface, and the ''[[shear stress]]'' that is parallel to the surface.

If the normal unit vector ''n'' of the surface (pointing from ''Q'' towards ''P'') is assumed fixed, the normal component can be expressed by a single number, the [[inner product|dot product]] {{nowrap|''T'' · ''n''}}.  This number will be positive if ''P'' is "pulling" on ''Q'' (tensile stress), and negative if ''P'' is "pushing" against ''Q'' (compressive stress) The shear component is then the vector {{nowrap|''T'' − (''T'' · ''n'')''n''}}.

=== Units ===
The dimension of stress is that of [[pressure]], and therefore its coordinates are commonly measured in the same units as pressure: namely, [[pascal (unit)|pascal]]s (Pa, that is, [[newton (force)|newton]]s per [[square metre]]) in the [[International System of Units|International System]], or [[pound-force|pounds]] per [[square inch]] (psi) in the [[Imperial units|Imperial system]]. Because mechanical stresses easily exceed a million Pascals, MPa, which stands for megapascal, is a common unit of stress.

=== Causes and effects ===
[[File:Vase-craquele-Emile-Galle-vers-1880-decor-mante-religieuse-cigale-1301.jpg|upright|thumb|Glass vase with the ''[[craquelé]]'' effect. The cracks are the result of brief but intense stress created when the semi-molten piece is briefly dipped in water.&lt;ref name=lamglass/&gt;]]
Stress in a material body may be due to multiple physical causes, including external influences and internal physical processes. Some of these agents (like gravity, changes in [[temperature]] and [[phase (chemistry)|phase]], and electromagnetic fields) act on the bulk of the material, varying continuously with position and time.  Other agents (like external loads and friction, ambient pressure, and contact forces) may create stresses and forces that are concentrated on certain surfaces, lines, or points; and possibly also on very short time intervals (as in the [[impulse (physics)|impulse]]s due to collisions). In general, the stress distribution in the body is expressed as a [[piecewise]] [[continuous function]] of space and time.

Conversely, stress is usually correlated with various effects on the material, possibly including changes in physical properties like [[birefringence]], [[polarizability|polarization]], and [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]]. The imposition of stress by an external agent usually creates some [[deformation (mechanics)|strain (deformation)]] in the material, even if it is too small to be detected. In a solid material, such strain will in turn generate an internal elastic stress, analogous to the reaction force of a stretched [[spring (device)|spring]], tending to restore the material to its original undeformed state. Fluid materials (liquids, [[gas]]es and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]s) by definition can only oppose deformations that would change their volume. However, if the deformation is changing with time, even in fluids there will usually be some viscous stress, opposing that change.

The relation between stress and its effects and causes, including deformation and rate of change of deformation, can be quite complicated (although a [[linear elasticity|linear approximation]] may be adequate in practice if the quantities are small enough). Stress that exceeds certain [[strength of materials|strength limits]] of the material will result in permanent deformation (such as [[plasticity (physics)|plastic flow]], [[fracture]], [[cavitation]]) or even change its [[crystal structure]]  and [[chemistry|chemical composition]].

==Simple stress==

In some situations, the stress within a body may adequately be described by a single number, or by a single vector (a number and a direction). Three such '''simple stress''' situations, that are often encountered in engineering design, are the ''uniaxial normal stress'', the ''simple shear stress'', and the ''isotropic normal stress''.&lt;ref name="Huston" /&gt;

===Uniaxial normal stress===
[[File:Axial stress noavg.svg|240px|thumb|right|Idealized stress in a straight bar with uniform cross-section.]]
A common situation with a simple stress pattern is when a straight rod, with uniform material and cross section, is subjected to [[tension (physics)|tension]] by opposite forces of magnitude &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; along its axis. If the system is in [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] and not changing with time, and the weight of the bar can be neglected, then through each transversal section of the bar the top part must pull on the bottom part with the same force, ''F'' with continuity through the full cross-sectional area'', A''. Therefore, the stress, σ throughout the bar, across any horizontal surface, can be expressed simply by the singly number σ, calculated simply with the magnitude of those forces, ''F'' and cross sectional area, ''A''.&lt;math display="block"&gt;\sigma=\frac{F}{A}&lt;/math&gt; On the other hand, if one imagines the bar being cut along its length, parallel to the axis, there will be no force (hence no stress) between the two halves across the cut.

This type of stress may be called (simple) normal stress or uniaxial stress; specifically, (uniaxial, simple, etc.) tensile stress.&lt;ref name="Huston" /&gt;  If the load is [[compression (physical)|compression]] on the bar, rather than stretching it, the analysis is the same except that the force ''F'' and the stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; change sign, and the stress is called compressive stress.

[[File:Normal stress.svg|240px|thumb|left|The ratio &lt;math&gt;\sigma = F/A&lt;/math&gt; may be only an average stress. The stress may be unevenly distributed over the cross section (''m''–''m''), especially near the attachment points (''n''–''n'').]]
This analysis assumes the stress is evenly distributed over the entire cross-section. In practice, depending on how the bar is attached at the ends and how it was manufactured, this assumption may not be valid. In that case, the value &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; = ''F''/''A'' will be only the average stress, called ''engineering stress'' or ''nominal stress''. However, if the bar's length ''L'' is many times its diameter ''D'', and it has no gross defects or [[built-in stress]], then the stress can be assumed to be uniformly distributed over any cross-section that is more than a few times ''D'' from both ends. (This observation is known as the [[Saint-Venant's principle]]).

Normal stress occurs in many other situations besides axial tension and compression. If an elastic bar with uniform and symmetric cross-section is bent in one of its planes of symmetry, the resulting ''bending stress'' will still be normal (perpendicular to the cross-section), but will vary over the cross section: the outer part will be under tensile stress, while the inner part will be compressed. Another variant of normal stress is the ''hoop stress'' that occurs on the walls of a cylindrical [[pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]]  or [[pressure vessel|vessel]] filled with pressurized fluid.

===Simple shear stress===

[[File:Shear stress.svg|240px|right|thumb|Shear stress in a horizontal bar loaded by two offset blocks.]]
Another simple type of stress occurs when a uniformly thick layer of elastic material like glue or rubber is firmly attached to two stiff bodies that are pulled in opposite directions by forces parallel to the layer; or a section of a soft metal bar that is being cut by the jaws of a [[snips|scissors-like tool]]. Let ''F'' be the magnitude of those forces, and ''M'' be the midplane of that layer. Just as in the normal stress case, the part of the layer on one side of ''M'' must pull the other part with the same force ''F''. Assuming that the direction of the forces is known, the stress across ''M'' can be expressed simply by the single number &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; , calculated simply with the magnitude of those forces, ''F'' and the cross sectional area, ''A''.&lt;math display="block"&gt;\tau=\frac{F}{A}&lt;/math&gt;However, unlike normal stress, this ''simple shear stress'' is directed parallel to the cross-section considered, rather than perpendicular to it.&lt;ref name="Huston" /&gt;  For any plane ''S'' that is perpendicular to the layer, the net internal force across ''S'', and hence the stress, will be zero.

As in the case of an axially loaded bar, in practice the shear stress may not be uniformly distributed over the layer; so, as before, the ratio ''F''/''A'' will only be an average ("nominal", "engineering") stress. However, that average is often sufficient for practical purposes.&lt;ref name="Pilkey" /&gt;{{rp|p.292}} Shear stress is observed also when a cylindrical bar such as a [[axle|shaft]] is subjected to opposite torques at its ends. In that case, the shear stress on each cross-section is parallel to the cross-section, but oriented tangentially relative to the axis, and increases with distance from the axis. Significant shear stress occurs in the middle plate (the "web") of [[I-beam]]s under bending loads, due to the web constraining the end plates ("flanges").

=== Isotropic stress ===
[[File:Isotropic stress noavg.svg|240px|right|thumb|Isotropic tensile stress. Top left: Each face of a cube of homogeneous material is pulled by a force with magnitude ''F'', applied evenly over the entire face whose area is ''A''.  The force across any section ''S'' of the cube must balance the forces applied below the section. In the three sections shown, the forces are ''F'' (top right), ''F''&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; (bottom left), and ''F''&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}/2&lt;/math&gt; (bottom right); and the area of ''S'' is ''A'', ''A''&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; and ''A''&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}/2&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. So the stress across ''S'' is ''F''/''A'' in all three cases.]]
Another simple type of stress occurs when the material body is under equal compression or tension in all directions.  This is the case, for example, in a portion of liquid or gas at rest, whether enclosed in some container or as part of a larger mass of fluid; or inside a cube of elastic material that is being pressed or pulled on all six faces by equal perpendicular forces — provided, in both cases, that the material is homogeneous, without built-in stress, and that the effect of gravity and other external forces can be neglected.

In these situations, the stress across any imaginary internal surface turns out to be equal in magnitude and always directed perpendicularly to the surface independently of the surface's orientation. This type of stress may be called ''isotropic normal'' or just ''isotropic''; if it is compressive, it is called ''hydrostatic pressure'' or just ''pressure''. Gases by definition cannot withstand tensile stresses, but some liquids may withstand surprisingly large amounts of isotropic tensile stress under some circumstances. see [[Z-tube]].

=== Cylinder stresses ===
Parts with [[rotational symmetry]], such as wheels, axles, pipes, and pillars, are very common in engineering. Often the stress patterns that occur in such parts have rotational or even [[cylindrical symmetry]]. The analysis of such [[cylinder stress]]es can take advantage of the symmetry to reduce the dimension of the domain and/or of the stress tensor.

== General stress ==
Often, mechanical bodies experience more than one type of stress at the same time; this is called ''combined stress''. In normal and shear stress, the magnitude of the stress is maximum for surfaces that are perpendicular to a certain direction &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, and zero across any surfaces that are parallel to &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. When the shear stress is zero only across surfaces that are perpendicular to one particular direction, the stress is called ''biaxial'', and can be viewed as the sum of two normal or shear stresses. In the most general case, called ''triaxial stress'', the stress is nonzero across every surface element.

=== The Cauchy stress tensor{{anchor|Cauchy stress tensor}} ===
{{Main article|Cauchy stress tensor}}
[[File:Components stress tensor cartesian.svg|270px|left|thumb|Components of stress in three dimensions]]
[[File:Cmec stress ball f02 t6.png|thumb|240px|right|Illustration of typical stresses (arrows) across various surface elements on the boundary of a particle (sphere), in a homogeneous material under uniform (but not isotropic) triaxial stress. The normal stresses on the principal axes are +5, +2, and −3 units.]]
Combined stresses cannot be described by a single vector. Even if the material is stressed in the same way throughout the volume of the body, the stress across any imaginary surface will depend on the orientation of that surface, in a non-trivial way.

However, Cauchy observed that the stress vector &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; across a surface will always be a [[linear function]] of the surface's [[surface normal|normal vector]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the unit-length vector that is perpendicular to it.  That is, &lt;math&gt;T = \boldsymbol{\sigma}(n)&lt;/math&gt;, where the function &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}(\alpha u + \beta v) = \alpha\boldsymbol{\sigma}(u) + \beta\boldsymbol{\sigma}(v)&lt;/math&gt;
for any vectors &lt;math&gt;u,v&lt;/math&gt; and any real numbers &lt;math&gt;\alpha,\beta&lt;/math&gt;.
The function &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;, now called the [[Cauchy stress tensor|(Cauchy) stress tensor]], completely describes the stress state of a uniformly stressed body. (Today, any linear connection between two physical vector quantities is called a [[tensor]], reflecting Cauchy's original use to describe the "tensions" (stresses) in a material.) In [[tensor calculus]], &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is classified as second-order tensor of [[type of a tensor|type (0,2)]].

Like any linear map between vectors, the stress tensor can be represented in any chosen [[Cartesian coordinate system]] by a 3×3 matrix of real numbers. Depending on whether the coordinates are numbered &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,x_3&lt;/math&gt; or named &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&lt;/math&gt;, the matrix may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma _{11} &amp; \sigma _{12} &amp; \sigma _{13} \\
    \sigma _{21} &amp; \sigma _{22} &amp; \sigma _{23} \\
    \sigma _{31} &amp; \sigma _{32} &amp; \sigma _{33} 
  \end{bmatrix}
  \quad\quad\quad
&lt;/math&gt;  or  &lt;math&gt;
  \quad\quad\quad
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma _{xx} &amp; \sigma _{xy} &amp; \sigma _{xz} \\
    \sigma _{yx} &amp; \sigma _{yy} &amp; \sigma _{yz} \\
    \sigma _{zx} &amp; \sigma _{zy} &amp; \sigma _{zz} \\
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
The stress vector &lt;math&gt;T = \boldsymbol{\sigma}(n)&lt;/math&gt; across a surface with [[normal vector]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; with coordinates &lt;math&gt;n_1,n_2,n_3&lt;/math&gt; is then a matrix product &lt;math&gt;T = n\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}=\boldsymbol{\sigma}^T\cdot n^T&lt;/math&gt; (where T in upper index is transposition) (look on [[Cauchy stress tensor]]), that is
:&lt;math&gt; 
  \begin{bmatrix} T_1\\T_2 \\ T_3 \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma_{11} &amp; \sigma_{21} &amp; \sigma_{31} \\
    \sigma_{12} &amp; \sigma_{22} &amp; \sigma_{32} \\
    \sigma_{13} &amp; \sigma_{23} &amp; \sigma_{33} 
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} n_1\\n_2 \\ n_3 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The linear relation between &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; follows from the fundamental laws of [[conservation of linear momentum]] and [[static equilibrium]] of forces, and is therefore mathematically exact, for any material and any stress situation. The components of the Cauchy stress tensor at every point in a material satisfy the equilibrium equations ([[Cauchy momentum equation|Cauchy’s equations of motion]] for zero acceleration). Moreover, the principle of [[conservation of angular momentum]] implies that the stress tensor is [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]], that is &lt;math&gt; \sigma_{12} = \sigma_{21}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{13} = \sigma_{31}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{23} = \sigma_{32} &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the stress state of the medium at any point and instant can be specified by only six independent parameters, rather than nine.  These may be written
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma_x &amp; \tau_{xy} &amp; \tau_{xz} \\
    \tau_{xy} &amp; \sigma_y &amp; \tau_{yz} \\
    \tau_{xz} &amp; \tau_{yz} &amp; \sigma_z
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the elements &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x,\sigma_y,\sigma_z&lt;/math&gt; are called the ''orthogonal normal stresses'' (relative to the chosen coordinate system), and &lt;math&gt;\tau_{xy}, \tau_{xz},\tau_{yz}&lt;/math&gt; the ''orthogonal shear stresses''.

===Change of coordinates===

The Cauchy stress tensor obeys the tensor transformation law under a change in the system of coordinates. A graphical representation of this transformation law is the [[Mohr's circle]] of stress distribution.

As a symmetric 3×3 real matrix, the stress tensor &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; has three mutually orthogonal unit-length [[eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvector]]s &lt;math&gt;e_1,e_2,e_3&lt;/math&gt; and three real [[eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue]]s &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\sigma} e_i = \lambda_i e_i&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, in a coordinate system with axes &lt;math&gt;e_1,e_2,e_3&lt;/math&gt;, the stress tensor is a diagonal matrix, and has only the three normal components &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3&lt;/math&gt; the [[principal stresses]]. If the three eigenvalues are equal, the stress is an [[isotropic]] compression or tension, always perpendicular to any surface, there is no shear stress, and the tensor is a diagonal matrix in any coordinate frame.

===Stress as a tensor field===
In general, stress is not uniformly distributed over a material body, and may vary with time. Therefore, the stress tensor must be defined for each point and each moment, by considering an [[infinitesimal]] particle of the medium surrounding that point, and taking the average stresses in that particle as being the stresses at the point.

=== Stress in thin plates ===
[[File:W39504 stat Nbk2007.jpg|240px|thumb|right|A [[tank car]] made from bent and welded steel plates.]]
Man-made objects are often made from stock plates of various materials by operations that do not change their essentially two-dimensional character, like cutting, drilling, gentle bending and welding along the edges. The description of stress in such bodies can be simplified by modeling those parts as two-dimensional surfaces rather than three-dimensional bodies.

In that view, one redefines a "particle" as being an infinitesimal patch of the plate's surface, so that the boundary between adjacent particles becomes an infinitesimal line element; both are implicitly extended in the third dimension, normal to (straight through) the plate. "Stress" is then redefined as being a measure of the internal forces between two adjacent "particles" across their common line element, divided by the length of that line. Some components of the stress tensor can be ignored, but since particles are not infinitesimal in the third dimension one can no longer ignore the torque that a particle applies on its neighbors. That torque is modeled as a ''bending stress'' that tends to change the [[curvature]] of the plate. However, these simplifications may not hold at welds, at sharp bends and creases (where the [[radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] is comparable to the thickness of the plate).

=== Stress in thin beams ===
[[File:Sandy Hook NJ beach fisherman's pole.jpg|120px|thumb|right|For stress modeling, a [[fishing pole]] may be considered one-dimensional.]]
The analysis of stress can be considerably simplified also for thin bars, [[beam (engineering)|beam]]s or wires of uniform (or smoothly varying) composition and cross-section that are subjected to moderate bending and twisting. For those bodies, one may consider only cross-sections that are perpendicular to the bar's axis, and redefine a "particle" as being a piece of wire with infinitesimal length between two such cross sections. The ordinary stress is then reduced to a scalar (tension or compression of the bar), but one must take into account also a ''bending stress'' (that tries to change the bar's curvature, in some direction perpendicular to the axis) and a ''torsional stress'' (that tries to twist or un-twist it about its axis).

===Other descriptions of stress===
The Cauchy stress tensor is used for stress analysis of material bodies experiencing [[Infinitesimal strain theory|small deformations]] where the differences in stress distribution in most cases can be neglected. For large deformations, also called [[Finite strain theory|finite deformations]], other measures of stress, such as the [[Piola–Kirchoff stress tensor|first and second Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensors]], the [[Stress measures|Biot stress tensor]], and the [[Stress measures|Kirchhoff stress tensor]], are required.

Solids, liquids, and gases have [[stress field]]s. Static fluids support normal stress but will flow under [[shear stress]]. Moving [[viscosity|viscous fluids]] can support shear stress (dynamic pressure). Solids can support both shear and normal stress, with [[ductile]] materials failing under shear and [[brittle]] materials failing under normal stress. All materials have temperature dependent variations in stress-related properties, and [[Non-Newtonian fluid|non-Newtonian]] materials have rate-dependent variations.

== Stress analysis ==
[[Stress analysis]] is a branch of [[applied physics]] that covers the determination of the internal distribution of internal forces in solid objects. It is an essential tool in [[engineering]] for the study and design of structures such as [[tunnel]]s, [[dam]]s, mechanical parts, and structural frames, under prescribed or expected loads.  It is also important in many other disciplines; for example, in [[geology]], to study phenomena like [[plate tectonics]], [[volcano|vulcanism]] and [[avalanche]]s; and in [[biology]], to understand the [[anatomy]] of living beings.

=== Goals and assumptions ===
Stress analysis is generally concerned with objects and structures that can be assumed to be in macroscopic [[static equilibrium]]. By [[Newton's laws of motion]], any external forces are being applied to such a system must be balanced by internal reaction forces,&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|p.97}} which are almost always surface contact forces between adjacent particles — that is, as stress.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt; Since every particle needs to be in equilibrium, this reaction stress will generally propagate from particle, creating a stress distribution throughout the body.

The typical problem in stress analysis is to determine these internal stresses, given the external forces that are acting on the system. The latter may be [[body force]]s (such as gravity or magnetic attraction), that act throughout the volume of a material;&lt;ref name="Irgens" /&gt;{{rp|p.42–81}} or concentrated loads (such as friction between an axle and a [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]], or the weight of a train wheel on a rail), that are imagined to act over a two-dimensional area, or along a line, or at single point.

In stress analysis one normally disregards the physical causes of the forces or the precise nature of the materials.  Instead, one assumes that the stresses are related to deformation (and, in non-static problems, to the rate of deformation) of the material by known [[constitutive equations]].&lt;ref name="Slaughter" /&gt;

=== Methods ===
Stress analysis may be carried out experimentally, by applying loads to the actual artifact or to scale model, and measuring the resulting stresses, by any of several available methods. This approach is often used for safety certification and monitoring. However, most stress analysis is done by mathematical methods, especially during design.

The basic stress analysis problem can be formulated by [[Euler's laws|Euler's equations of motion]] for continuous bodies (which are consequences of [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's laws]] for conservation of [[linear momentum]] and [[angular momentum]]) and the [[Euler-Cauchy stress principle]], together with the appropriate constitutive equations. Thus one obtains a system of [[partial differential equations]] involving the stress tensor field and the [[strain tensor]] field, as unknown functions to be determined. The external body forces appear as the independent ("right-hand side") term in the differential equations, while the concentrated forces appear as boundary conditions.  The basic stress analysis problem is therefore a [[boundary-value problem]].

Stress analysis for [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] structures is based on the [[theory of elasticity]] and [[infinitesimal strain theory]]. When the applied loads cause permanent deformation, one must use more complicated constitutive equations, that can account for the physical processes involved ([[plasticity (physics)|plastic flow]], [[fracture]], [[phase transition|phase change]], etc.).

However, engineered structures are usually designed so that the maximum expected stresses are well within the range of [[linear elasticity]] (the generalization of [[Hooke’s law]] for continuous media); that is, the deformations caused by internal stresses are linearly related to them. In this case the differential equations that define the stress tensor are linear, and the problem becomes much easier. For one thing, the stress at any point will be a linear function of the loads, too. For small enough stresses, even non-linear systems can usually be assumed to be linear.

[[File:Loaded truss.svg|240px|right|thumb|Simplified model of a truss for stress analysis, assuming unidimensional elements under uniform axial tension or compression.]]
Stress analysis is simplified when the physical dimensions and the distribution of loads allow the structure to be treated as one- or two-dimensional. In the analysis of trusses, for example, the stress field may be assumed to be uniform and uniaxial over each member. Then the differential equations reduce to a finite set of equations (usually linear) with finitely many unknowns.
In other contexts one may be able to reduce the three-dimensional problem to a two-dimensional one, and/or replace the general stress and strain tensors by simpler models like uniaxial tension/compression, simple shear, etc.

Still, for two- or three-dimensional cases one must solve a partial differential equation problem.
Analytical or closed-form solutions to the differential equations can be obtained when the geometry,  constitutive relations, and boundary conditions are simple enough. Otherwise one must generally resort to numerical approximations such as the [[finite element method]], the [[finite difference method]], and the [[boundary element method]].

==Alternative measures of stress==
{{Main article|Stress measures}}
Other useful stress measures include the first and second [[Stress measures|Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensors]], the [[Stress measures#Biot stress|Biot stress tensor]], and the [[Stress measures#Kirchhoff stress|Kirchhoff stress tensor]].

===Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor===
In the case of [[finite deformation tensor|finite deformations]], the ''Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensors'' express the stress relative to the reference configuration. This is in contrast to the [[Cauchy stress tensor]] which expresses the stress relative to the present configuration. For infinitesimal deformations and rotations, the Cauchy and Piola–Kirchhoff tensors are identical.

Whereas the Cauchy stress tensor &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; relates stresses in the current configuration, the deformation [[gradient]] and strain tensors are described by relating the motion to the reference configuration; thus not all tensors describing the state of the material are in either the reference or current configuration. Describing the stress, strain and deformation either in the reference or current configuration would make it easier to define constitutive models (for example, the Cauchy Stress tensor is variant to a pure rotation, while the deformation strain tensor is invariant; thus creating problems in defining a constitutive model that relates a varying tensor, in terms of an invariant one during pure rotation; as by definition constitutive models have to be invariant to pure rotations). The 1st Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{P}&lt;/math&gt; is one possible solution to this problem. It defines a family of tensors, which describe the configuration of the body in either the current or the reference state.

The 1st Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{P}&lt;/math&gt; relates forces in the ''present'' configuration with areas in the ''reference'' ("material") configuration.
:&lt;math&gt;
 \boldsymbol{P} = J~\boldsymbol{\sigma}~\boldsymbol{F}^{-T} ~&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[deformation gradient]] and &lt;math&gt;J= \det\boldsymbol{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] [[determinant]].

In terms of components with respect to an [[orthonormal basis]], the first Piola–Kirchhoff stress is given by

:&lt;math&gt;P_{iL} = J~\sigma_{ik}~F^{-1}_{Lk} = J~\sigma_{ik}~\cfrac{\partial X_L}{\partial x_k}~\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Because it relates different coordinate systems, the 1st Piola–Kirchhoff stress is a [[two-point tensor]]. In general, it is not symmetric. The 1st Piola–Kirchhoff stress is the 3D generalization of the 1D concept of [[engineering stress]].

If the material rotates without a change in stress state (rigid rotation), the components of the 1st Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor will vary with material orientation.

The 1st Piola–Kirchhoff stress is energy conjugate to the deformation gradient.

====2nd Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor====
Whereas the 1st Piola–Kirchhoff stress relates forces in the current configuration to areas in the reference configuration, the 2nd Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{S}&lt;/math&gt; relates forces in the reference configuration to areas in the reference configuration. The force in the reference configuration is obtained via a mapping that preserves the relative relationship between the force direction and the area normal in the reference configuration.
:&lt;math&gt;
 \boldsymbol{S} = J~\boldsymbol{F}^{-1}\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldsymbol{F}^{-T} ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

In [[index notation]] with respect to an orthonormal basis,
:&lt;math&gt;S_{IL}=J~F^{-1}_{Ik}~F^{-1}_{Lm}~\sigma_{km} = J~\cfrac{\partial X_I}{\partial x_k}~\cfrac{\partial X_L}{\partial x_m}~\sigma_{km} \!\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This tensor, a one-point tensor, is symmetric.

If the material rotates without a change in stress state (rigid rotation), the components of the 2nd Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor remain constant, irrespective of material orientation.

The 2nd Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor is energy conjugate to the [[Finite deformation tensor|Green–Lagrange finite strain tensor]].

'''''The Coal Question; An Inquiry Concerning the Progress of the Nation, and the Probable Exhaustion of Our Coal Mines''''' is a book that [[economist]] [[William Stanley Jevons]] wrote in 1865 to explore the implications of Britain's reliance on [[coal]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book |last=Jevons |first=William Stanley |author-link=William Stanley Jevons|year=1865 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title=The Coal Question; An Inquiry Concerning the Progress of the Nation, and the Probable Exhaustion of Our Coal Mines    |edition=1 |publisher= Macmillan &amp; Co |publication-date=1865 |publication-place=London &amp; Cambridge |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gAAKAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AAAotKDT6KKcC&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=12 November 2014 }} via Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book |last=Jevons |first=William Stanley |author-link=William Stanley Jevons|year=1866 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title=The Coal Question; An Inquiry Concerning the Progress of the Nation, and the Probable Exhaustion of Our Coal Mines    |edition=2 |publisher= Macmillan &amp; Co |publication-date=1866 |publication-place=London |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oQdZAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AAAotKDT6KKcC&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=12 November 2014 }} via Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; Given that coal was a finite, non-renewable energy resource, Jevons raised the question of [[sustainability]]. "Are we [[wikt:wise|wise]]," he asked rhetorically, "in allowing the commerce of this country to rise beyond the point at which we can long maintain it?" His central thesis was that the supremacy of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] over global affairs was transitory, given the finite nature of its primary energy resource. In propounding this thesis, Jevons covered a range of issues central to sustainability, including [[limits to growth]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], overshoot,&lt;ref name="overshoot"&gt;{{cite book |last=Catton |first=William |authorlink=William R. Catton, Jr. |title=Overshoot: The Ecological Basis of Revolutionary Change |date=1982-06-01 |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]] |isbn=978-0-252-00988-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; energy return on energy input ([[EROEI]]), taxation of energy resources, [[renewable energy]] alternatives, and resource peaking{{emdash}}a subject widely discussed today under the rubric of [[peak oil]].

==The significance of coal==
Jevons introduces the first chapter of ''The Coal Question'' with a succinct description of coal's wonders and of society's insatiable appetite for it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Coal in truth stands not beside but entirely above all other [[commodities]]. It is the material energy of the country — the universal aid — the factor in everything we do. With coal almost any feat is possible or easy; without it we are thrown back into the laborious poverty of early times. With such facts familiarly before us, it can be no matter of surprise that year by year we make larger draughts upon a material of such myriad qualities — of such miraculous powers."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...new applications of coal are of an unlimited character. In the command of force, molecular and mechanical, we have the key to all the infinite varieties of change in place or kind of which nature is capable. No chemical or mechanical operation, perhaps, is quite impossible to us, and invention consists in discovering those which are useful and commercially practicable...."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jevons further argues that coal is the source of the UK's prosperity and global dominance.

==Limits to growth and resource peaking==
[[File:Jevons-exponential growth.jpg|left|thumb|Jevons' graph extrapolating to 1970 the exponential growth of coal production.]]
Because coal was not unlimited, because its access became more difficult with time, and because the demand [[Exponential growth|grew exponentially]], Jevons argued that limits or boundaries to prosperity would appear sooner than was generally realized:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I must point out the painful fact that such a rate of growth will before long render our consumption of coal comparable with the total supply. In the increasing depth and difficulty of coal mining we shall meet that vague, but inevitable boundary that will stop our progress."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Jevons' day, British geologists were estimating that the country had [[coal reserves]] of 90 billion tons. Jevons believed that extraction of much of this amount would prove to be uneconomical. But, even if the entire quantity could be extracted, Jevons argued, exponential economic growth could not continue unabated.

Using historical production estimates, Jevons showed that for the previous 80 years production had grown at a relatively consistent rate of 3.5% per year, or 41% per decade. If this growth rate were to continue, production would grow from approximately 100 million tons in 1865 to more than 2.6 billion tons in 100 years. Jevons then calculated that, in that case, the country would produce approximately 100 billion tons within that period.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{110} 82.17 (1.035)^t\, dt&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In short, resources were not sufficient for even 100 years, and long before the 100 years point, the growth rate, which was the measure of prosperity, would have to decline. At some point, production would simply hit a peak, which itself meant dire consequences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Suppose our progress to be checked within half a century, yet by that time our consumption will probably be three or four times what it now is; there is nothing impossible or improbable in this; it is a moderate supposition, considering that our consumption has increased eight-fold in the last sixty years. But how shortened and darkened will the prospects of the country appear, with mines already deep, fuel dear, and yet a high rate of consumption to keep up if we are not to retrograde."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Even before the peak was reached, high extraction costs could cause the UK to lose the [[competitive advantage]] it currently enjoyed in manufacturing and shipping.

British coal production did in fact peak in 1913, but at 292 million tons, about half the amount Jevons' extrapolation suggested. Just under a third of this was exported. Since then, production has dropped to less than 20 million tons.&lt;ref name="uk2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file36183.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100304140252/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file36183.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-03-04 |title=Energy Trends and Quarterly Energy Prices |date=December 2006 |publisher=UK Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Current UK resources are estimated at about 400 million tons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coal.gov.uk/media//286DC/CA-AnnualReport-0607.pdf 2007 Annual Report of the UK Coal Authority.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population and the "Malthus Doctrine"==
According to Jevons, [[coal depletion]] had serious ramifications for population growth. The population of the UK had increased by more than 10% each decade for the prior 70 years, not surprising given that coal production was growing at 40% per decade, meaning that the ''per capita'' wealth was growing.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"For the present our cheap supplies of coal, and our skill in its employment, and the freedom of our commerce with other wide lands, render us independent of the limited agricultural area of these islands, and take us out of the scope of Malthus' doctrine. We are growing rich and numerous upon a source of wealth of which the fertility does not yet apparently decrease with our demands upon it. Hence the uniform and extraordinary rate of growth which this country presents. We are like settlers spreading in a rich new country of which the boundaries are yet unknown and unfelt."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, as the growth in coal production slowed, the population growth might easily surpass the production growth, leading to a drop in living conditions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Now population, when it grows, moves with a certain uniform impetus, like a body in motion; and uniform progress of population, as I have fully explained before, is multiplication in a uniform ratio. But long-continued progress in such a manner is altogether impossible — it must outstrip all physical conditions and bounds; and the longer it continues, the more severely must the ultimate check be felt. I do not hesitate to say, therefore, that the rapid growth of our great towns, gratifying as it is in the present, is a matter of very serious concern as regards the future."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast to [[Malthus]]'s view that resource growth was linear, Jevons took resource growth as being exponential, like population. This modification of Malthus's theory did not alter the conclusion that unrestrained population growth would inevitably surpass the nation's ability to expand its resources. Prosperity, in terms of ''per capita'' consumption, would therefore fall. Moreover, because the primary resource was non-renewable, the fall would be more dramatic than Malthus envisioned:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A farm, however far pushed, will under proper cultivation continue to yield forever a constant crop. But in a mine there is no reproduction, and the produce once pushed to the utmost will soon begin to fail and sink towards zero. So far then as our wealth and progress depend upon the superior command of coal we must not only stop—we must go back.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The Jevons Paradox==
{{main article|Jevons paradox}}

Given that energy depletion posed long-term dangers for society, Jevons analyzed possible mitigation measures. In so doing, he considered the phenomenon that has come to be known as [[Jevons paradox]]. As he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
" It is wholly a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to a diminished consumption. The very contrary is the truth."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jevons described the historical development of engine technology and argued that the great increase in the UK's consumption of coal was due to the efficiency (or "economy") brought about by technological innovations, with particular credit going to [[James Watt]]'s 1776 invention of the [[steam engine]]. Like many innovations that followed, such as improved methods for smelting iron, greater economy broadened usage and led to increased energy consumption.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Whatever, therefore, conduces to increase the efficiency of coal, and to diminish the cost of its use, directly tends to augment the value of the steam-engine, and to enlarge the field of its operations."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jevons also considered and rejected other measures that might reduce consumption, such as coal taxes and export restrictions. Similarly, although he deplored the wasteful practice of burning away low quality coal at the mine site, he did not support conservation legislation.

An alternative that he did consider practical was tightened government fiscal policy, based on using tax revenue to reduce the national debt. Tightened fiscal policy would have the effect of slowing economic growth, thereby slowing coal consumption, at least until the debt was erased. Still, Jevons admitted that the overall impact of such a measure, even if it were implemented, would be minimal. In short, the prospect that society would voluntarily reduce consumption was dim.

==Energy alternatives==
Jevons considered the feasibility of alternative energy sources, foreshadowing modern debates on the subject. Regarding wind and tidal forces, he explained that such sources of intermittent power could be made more useful if the energy were stored, for example by pumping water to a height for subsequent use as hydro power. He reviewed biomass, namely timber, and commented that forests covering all of the UK could not supply energy equal to the current coal production. He also mentioned possibilities for geothermal and solar power, pointing out that if these sources did become useful, the UK would lose its competitive advantages in global industry. He was not aware of the future importance of [[natural gas]] or [[petroleum]] as prime energy sources since they were developed after his book was published.

Regarding electricity, which he pointed out was not an energy source but a means of energy distribution, Jevons noted that hydroelectric power was feasible but that reservoirs would face the problem of silt build-up. He discounted hydrogen generation as a means of electricity storage and distribution, calculating that the energy density of hydrogen would never make it practical. He predicted that steam would remain the most efficient means of generating electricity.

==Social responsibility in time of prosperity==
Jevons held that despite the desirability of reducing coal consumption, the outlook for implementing significant constraints was dim. Still, the UK's prosperity should at least be seen as imposing responsibilities on the current generation. In particular, Jevons proposed applying the current wealth to righting social ills and to creating a more just society:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We must begin to allow that we can do today what we cannot so well do tomorrow....
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Reflection will show that we ought not to think of interfering with the free use of the material wealth which Providence has placed at our disposal, but that our duties wholly consist in the earnest and wise application of it. We may spend it on the one hand in increased luxury and ostentation and corruption, and we shall be blamed. We may spend it on the other hand in raising the social and moral condition of the people, and in reducing the burdens of future generations. Even if our successors be less happily placed than ourselves they will not then blame us."&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, W. Stanley, The Coal Question, 2nd revised edition, 1866, Macmillan and Co., page xxv&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jevons also articulated several social ills that particularly concerned him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The ignorance, improvidence, and brutish drunkenness of our lower working classes must be dispelled by a general system of education, which may effect for a future generation what is hopeless for the present generation. One preparatory and indispensable measure, however, is a far more general restriction on the employment of children in manufacture. At present it may almost be said to be profitable to breed little slaves and put them to labour early, so as to get earnings out of them before they have a will of their own. A worse premium upon improvidence and future wretchedness could not be imagined."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Global developments after Jevons==
As Jevons predicted, coal production could not grow exponentially forever. UK production peaked in 1913, and the country lost its global superiority to a new giant of energy production, the United States, a turn of events that was also predicted by Jevons. The UK had by then developed [[oil]] resources in the [[Middle East]] and increasingly used the fuel for power generation.

Although UK production could not continue to grow at the annual rate of 3.5%, the world's fossil fuel consumption did grow at this rate until about 1970. According to Jevons, UK coal production in 1865 was estimated as being equal to production in the rest of the world, giving a rough world estimate of 200 million tons. According to the [[US Department of Energy]], global [[fossil fuel]] consumption in 1970 was 200 Quad [[BTU]], or 7.2 billion tons coal equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/aer/txt/ptb1101.html World Primary Energy Production by Source, 1970-2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, consumption grew by a factor of 36, representing average annual exponential growth over 105 years of about 3.4%.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[105]{36}-1=3.4\%&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the 34 subsequent years, to 2004, consumption grew by a factor of 2.1, or 2.2% per year, an indication, according to organizations such as [[Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas|ASPO]] that global energy resources are thinning.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[34]{2.1}-1=2.2\%&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantity of the world's remaining energy resources is a matter of dispute and serious concern. Between 2005 and 2007, despite the trebling of oil prices, oil production remained relatively flat,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/ipsr/t14.xls December 2007 International Petroleum Monthly] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713064318/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/ipsr/t14.xls |date=2007-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a sign according to many that oil production has peaked.&lt;ref&gt;see http://www.simmonsco-intl.com/files/AnotherNailintheCoffin.pdf{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies by Dave Rutledge of the [[California Institute of Technology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rutledge.caltech.edu/|title=Dave Rutledge website|publisher=|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Energy Watch Group of Germany&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071024021553/http://www.energywatchgroup.org/Reports.24+M5d637b1e38d.0.html Energy Watch Group Reports]&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that global coal production will also peak within the current generation, perhaps as soon as 2030. A parallel study by the Energy Watch Group also indicates the limited supply of [[uranium]]; this report states that like UK coal production 200 years ago, the production of uranium has first targeted high quality ores, and remaining sources are less dense and more difficult to access.

Fetter states that at least 230 years of proven uranium reserves are available at present worldwide rates of consumption, and using uranium extraction from seawater, up to 60,000 years of uranium are available. Further, using advanced [[breeder reactor]]s and [[nuclear reprocessing]], the 230 years of proven uranium reserves may be extended up to 30,000 years; similar gains are achievable from the 60,000 years of uranium reserves from seawater.&lt;ref name="SciAm-UraniumSupplyLength"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fetter|first=Steve|title=How Long Will The World's Uranium Supplies Last|journal=[[Scientific American]]|date=2009-01-26|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-long-will-global-uranium-deposits-last|accessdate=2010-12-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319063123/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-long-will-global-uranium-deposits-last|archive-date=2011-03-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''tip-speed ratio''', X, or '''TSR''' for [[wind turbine]]s is the ratio between the tangential speed of the tip of a blade and the actual [[speed]] of the wind, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. The tip-speed ratio is related to efficiency, with the optimum varying with blade design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wind Turbine Tip Speed Ratio {{!}} REUK.co.uk|url=http://www.reuk.co.uk/wordpress/wind/wind-turbine-tip-speed-ratio/|website=www.reuk.co.uk|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher tip speeds result in higher noise levels and require stronger blades due to large [[centrifugal force]]s.

:: &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{\mbox{Tip speed of blade}}{\mbox{Wind speed}}&lt;/math&gt;

The tip speed of the blade can be calculated as &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; times R, where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the rotor rotational speed in radians/second, and R is the rotor radius in meters. Therefore, we can also write:

:: &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{\omega\text{R}}{v}&lt;/math&gt;
when &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the wind speed specified in meters/second.

== Cp - λ curves ==
The power coefficient, &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; is a quantity that expresses what fraction of the power in the wind is being extracted by the wind turbine. It is generally assumed to be a function of both tip-speed ratio and pitch angle. Below is a plot of the variation of the power coefficient with variations in the tip-speed ratio when the pitch is held constant:

[[File:Cplambdadiagram.jpg|500px|center]]

=== The case for variable speed wind turbines ===
Originally, wind turbines were fixed speed. This has the benefit that the rotor speed in the generator is constant, thus the frequency of the AC Voltage is fixed. This allows the wind turbine to be directly connected to a transmission system. However, from the figure above, we can see that the power coefficient is a function of the tip-speed ratio. By extension, the efficiency of the wind turbine is a function of the tip-speed ratio.

Ideally, one would like to have a turbine operating at the maximum value of &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; at all wind speeds. This means that as the wind speed changes, the rotor speed must change to such that &lt;math&gt;C_p = C_{p~max}&lt;/math&gt;. A wind turbine with a variable rotor speed is called a [[variable speed wind turbine]]. Whilst this does mean that the wind turbine operates at or close to &lt;math&gt;C_{p~max}&lt;/math&gt; for a range of wind speeds, the frequency of the AC voltage generator will not be constant. This can be seen in the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;
N = \frac{120f}{P}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the rotor angular speed, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of the AC voltage generated in the stator windings, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the number of poles in the [[Alternator|generator]] inside the nacelle. That is, direct connection to a [[Electric power transmission|transmission system]] for a variable speed is not permissible. What is required is a power converter which converts the signal generated by the turbine generator into DC and then converts that signal to an AC signal with the grid/transmission system frequency.

=== The case against variable speed wind turbines ===
As already mentioned, variable speed wind turbines cannot be directly connected to a transmission system. One of the drawbacks of this is that the inertia of the transmission system is reduced as more variable speed wind turbines are put online. This can result in more significant drops in the transmission system's voltage frequency in the event of the loss of a generating unit. Furthermore, variable speed wind turbines require power electronics, which increases the complexity of the turbine and introduces new sources of failures. It has also been suggested that additional energy capture achieved by comparing a variable speed wind turbine to a fixed speed wind turbine is approximately 2%.&lt;ref&gt;Dependence of performance of variable speed wind
turbines on the turbulence, dynamics and control, Leithead&lt;/ref&gt;

In the system of [[Aristotelian logic]], the '''triangle of opposition''' is a diagram representing the different ways in which each of the three propositions of the system is logically related ('opposed') to each of the others. The system is also useful in the analysis of syllogistic logic, serving to identify the allowed logical conversions from one type to another.

'''''Two Treatises of Government'''''  (or '''''Two Treatises of Government: In the Former, The False Principles, and Foundation of Sir Robert Filmer, and His Followers, Are Detected and Overthrown. The Latter Is an Essay Concerning The True Original, Extent, and End of Civil Government''''') is a work of [[political philosophy]] published anonymously in 1689 by [[John Locke]]. The ''First Treatise'' attacks [[patriarchalism]] in the form of sentence-by-sentence refutation of [[Robert Filmer]]'s ''[[Patriarcha]]'', while the ''Second Treatise'' outlines Locke's ideas for a more civilized society based on [[natural rights]] and [[social contract|contract theory]].

This publication contrasts former political works by Locke himself.

==Historical context==
King [[James II of England]] (VII of Scotland) was overthrown in 1688 by a union of Parliamentarians and the [[stadtholder]] of the [[Dutch Republic]] William III of Oranje-Nassau (William of Orange), who as a result ascended the English throne as [[William III of England]]. This is known as the [[Glorious Revolution]], also called the Revolution of 1688. Locke claims in the "Preface" to the ''Two Treatises'' that its purpose is to justify William III's ascension to the throne, though [[Peter Laslett]] suggests that the bulk of the writing was instead completed between 1679–1680 (and subsequently revised until Locke was driven into exile in 1683).&lt;ref&gt;Laslett, "Introduction," 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Laslett, Locke was writing his ''Two Treatises'' during the [[Exclusion Crisis]], which attempted to prevent James II from ever taking the throne in the first place. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], Locke's mentor, patron and friend, introduced the bill, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. [[Richard Ashcraft]], following in Laslett's suggestion that the ''Two Treatises'' were written before the Revolution, objected that Shaftesbury's party did not advocate revolution during the Exclusion Crisis. He suggests that they are instead better associated with the revolutionary conspiracies that swirled around what would come to be known as the [[Rye House Plot]].&lt;ref&gt;Ashcraft, ''Revolutionary Politics''.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke, Shaftesbury and many others were forced into exile; some, such as Sidney, were even executed for treason. Locke knew his work was dangerous—he never acknowledged his authorship within his lifetime.

==Publication history==
[[File:LockeTreatiseAmerica.png|200px|thumb|left|The only edition of the ''Treatises'' published in America during the 18th century (1773)]]
''Two Treatises'' was first published, anonymously, in December 1689 (following printing conventions of the time, its title page was marked 1690). Locke was unhappy with this edition, complaining to the publisher about its many errors. For the rest of his life, he was intent on republishing the ''Two Treatises'' in a form that better reflected his meaning. Peter Laslett, one of the foremost Locke scholars, has suggested that Locke held the printers to a higher "standard of perfection" than the technology of the time would permit.&lt;ref&gt;Laslett, Peter. "Introduction." ''Two Treatises of Government''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1988), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Be that as it may, the first edition was indeed replete with errors.  The second edition was even worse, and finally printed on cheap paper and sold to the poor. The third edition was much improved, but Locke was still not satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book |last= |first= |author-link= |year=1698 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title=Two Treatises of Government: In The Former the False Principles and Foundation of Sir Robert Filmer and His Followers, are Detected and Overthrown.

The ''Two Treatises'' begin with a Preface announcing what Locke hopes to achieve, but he also mentions that more than half of his original draft, occupying a space between the ''First'' and ''Second Treatises'', has been irretrievably lost.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''Two Treatises of Government''. Ed. Peter Laslett. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1988), 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Laslett maintains that, while Locke may have added or altered some portions in 1689, he did not make any revisions to accommodate for the missing section; he argues, for example, that the end of the ''First Treatise'' breaks off in mid-sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Laslett, "English Revolution," 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1691 ''Two Treatises'' was translated into French by David Mazzel, a French [[Huguenot]] living in the Netherlands. This translation left out Locke's "Preface," all of the ''First Treatise'', and the first chapter of the ''Second Treatise'' (which summarised Locke's conclusions in the ''First Treatise''). It was in this form that Locke's work was reprinted during the 18th century in France and in this form that [[Montesquieu]], [[Voltaire]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] were exposed to it.&lt;ref&gt;Laslett, "Introduction," 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The only American edition from the 18th century was printed in 1773 in Boston; it, too, left out all of these sections. There were no other American editions until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Laslett, "Introduction," 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main ideas==
''Two Treatises'' is divided into the ''First Treatise'' and the ''Second Treatise''. The original title of the ''Second Treatise'' appears to have been simply "Book II," corresponding to the title of the ''First Treatise'', "Book I."  Before publication, however, Locke gave it greater prominence by (hastily) inserting a separate title page:  "An Essay Concerning the True Original, Extent and End of Civil Government."&lt;ref&gt;Laslett, 266.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''First Treatise'' is focused on the refutation of [[Robert Filmer|Sir Robert Filmer]], in particular his ''Patriarcha'', which argued that civil society was founded on a divinely sanctioned patriarchalism. Locke proceeds through Filmer's arguments, contesting his proofs from [[Scripture]] and ridiculing them as senseless, until concluding that no government can be justified by an appeal to the [[divine right of kings]].

The ''Second Treatise'' outlines a theory of civil society. Locke begins by describing the [[state of nature]], a picture much more stable than [[Thomas Hobbes]]' state of "war of every man against every man," and argues that all men are created equal in the state of nature by God. From this, he goes on to explain the hypothetical rise of property and civilization, in the process explaining that the only legitimate governments are those that have the consent of the people. Therefore, any government that rules without the consent of the people can, in theory, be overthrown.

==''First Treatise''==
[[File:Patriarcha; or the Natural Power of Kings.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Title page from [[Robert Filmer|Filmer's]] ''Patriarcha'' (1680)]]
The ''First Treatise'' is an extended attack on [[Sir Robert Filmer]]'s ''Patriarcha''. Locke's argument proceeds along two lines:  first, he undercuts the Scriptural support that Filmer had offered for his thesis, and second he argues that the acceptance of Filmer's thesis can lead only to slavery (and absurdity). Locke chose Filmer as his target, he says, because of his reputation and because he "carried this Argument [''jure divino''] farthest, and is supposed to have brought it to perfection" (1st Tr., §&amp;nbsp;5).

Filmer's text presented an argument for a [[divine right of kings|divinely ordained]], [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary]], [[absolute monarchy|absolute]] monarchy. According to Filmer, [[Adam and Eve|the Biblical Adam]] in his role as father possessed unlimited power over his children and this authority passed down through the generations. Locke attacks this on several grounds. Accepting that fatherhood grants authority, he argues, it would do so only by the act of begetting, and so cannot be transmitted to one's children because only God can create life. Nor is the power of a father over his children absolute, as Filmer would have it; Locke points to the joint power parents share over their children referred to in the Bible. In the ''Second Treatise'' Locke returns to a discussion of parental power. (Both of these discussions have drawn the interest of modern [[feminism|feminists]] such as [[Carole Pateman]].)

Filmer also suggested that Adam's absolute authority came from his [[property|ownership]] over all the world. To this, Locke responds that the world was originally held in common (a theme that will return in the ''Second Treatise''). But, even if it were not, he argues, God's grant to Adam covered only the land and brute animals, not human beings. Nor could Adam, or his heir, leverage this grant to enslave mankind, for the [[natural law|law of nature]] forbids reducing one's fellows to a state of desperation, if one possesses a sufficient surplus to maintain oneself securely. And even if this charity were not commanded by reason, Locke continues, such a strategy for gaining dominion would prove only that the foundation of government lies in consent.

Locke intimates in the ''First Treatise'' that the doctrine of [[divine right of kings]] (''jure divino'') will eventually be the downfall of all governments. In his final chapter he asks, "Who heir?"  If Filmer is correct, there should be only one rightful king in all the world—the heir of Adam. But since it is impossible to discover the true heir of Adam, no government, under Filmer's principles, can require that its members obey its rulers. Filmer must therefore say that men are duty-bound to obey their present rulers. Locke writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think he is the first Politician, who, pretending to settle Government upon its true Basis, and to establish the Thrones of lawful Princes, ever told the World, That he was ''properly a King, whose Manner of Government was by Supreme Power, by what Means soever he obtained it''; which in plain ''English'' is to say, that Regal and Supreme Power is properly and truly his, who can by any Means seize upon it; and if this be, to be ''properly a King'', I wonder how he came to think of, or where he will find, an ''Usurper''.  (1st Tr., §&amp;nbsp;79)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Locke ends the ''First Treatise'' by examining the history told in the Bible and the history of the world since then; he concludes that there is no evidence to support Filmer's hypothesis. According to Locke, no king has ever claimed that his authority rested upon his being the heir of Adam. It is [[Robert Filmer|Filmer]], Locke alleges, who is the innovator in politics, not those who assert the natural equality and freedom of man.

==''Second Treatise''==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}
In the ''Second Treatise'' Locke develops a number of notable themes. It begins with a depiction of the [[state of nature]], wherein individuals are under no obligation to obey one another but are each themselves judge of what the [[natural law|law of nature]] requires. It also covers conquest and slavery, property, representative government, and the right of revolution.

===State of nature===
Locke defines the state of nature thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To properly understand political power and trace its origins, we must consider the state that all people are in naturally.
That is a state of perfect freedom of acting and disposing of their own possessions and persons as they think fit within the bounds of the law of nature. People in this state do not have to ask permission to act or depend on the will of others to arrange matters on their behalf. The natural state is also one of equality in which all power and jurisdiction is reciprocal and no one has more than another. It is evident that all human beings—as creatures belonging to the same species and rank and born indiscriminately with all the same natural advantages and faculties—are equal amongst themselves. They have no relationship of subordination or subjection unless God (the lord and master of them all) had clearly set one person above another and conferred on him an undoubted right to dominion and sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;''Two Treatises On Government: A Translation Into Modern English'', ISR/Google Books, 2009, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d_4BGe7-pFIC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=%22To+properly+understand+political+power+and+trace+its+origins,+we+must+consider+the+state+that+all+people+are+in+naturally.+That+is+a+state+of+perfect+freedom+of+acting+and+disposing+of+their+own+possessions+and+persons+as+they+think+fit+within+the+bounds&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XBknIlI2v2&amp;sig=E1ATOrww4ECFdDHuTaXUG-UQWPs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj21K-K8-7QAhXqAMAKHaJPD5MQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22To+properly+understand+political+power+and+trace+its+origins,+we+must+consider+the+state+that+all+people+are+in+naturally.+That+is+a+state+of+perfect+freedom+of+acting+and+disposing+of+their+own+possessions+and+persons+as+they+think+fit+within+the+bounds&amp;f=false|title=Two Treatises on Government: A Translation Into Modern English|first=John|last=Locke|date=15 August 2013|publisher=Industrial Systems Research|via=Google Books|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220193727/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d_4BGe7-pFIC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=%22To+properly+understand+political+power+and+trace+its+origins,+we+must+consider+the+state+that+all+people+are+in+naturally.+That+is+a+state+of+perfect+freedom+of+acting+and+disposing+of+their+own+possessions+and+persons+as+they+think+fit+within+the+bounds&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XBknIlI2v2&amp;sig=E1ATOrww4ECFdDHuTaXUG-UQWPs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj21K-K8-7QAhXqAMAKHaJPD5MQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22To+properly+understand+political+power+and+trace+its+origins,+we+must+consider+the+state+that+all+people+are+in+naturally.+That+is+a+state+of+perfect+freedom+of+acting+and+disposing+of+their+own+possessions+and+persons+as+they+think+fit+within+the+bounds&amp;f=false|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The work of [[Thomas Hobbes]] made theories based upon a [[state of nature]] popular in [[Early Modern Britain|17th-century England]], even as most of those who employed such arguments were deeply troubled by his absolutist conclusions. Locke's state of nature can be seen in light of this tradition. There is not and never has been any divinely ordained monarch over the entire world, Locke argues. However, the fact that the natural state of humanity is without an institutionalized government does not mean it is lawless. Human beings are still subject to the laws of God and nature. In contrast to Hobbes, who posited the state of nature as a hypothetical possibility, Locke takes great pains to show that such a state did indeed exist. Actually, it still exists in the area of international relations where there is not and is never likely to be any legitimate overarching government (i.e., one directly chosen by all the people subject to it).  Whereas Hobbes stresses the disadvantages of the state of nature, Locke points to its good points. It is free, if full of continual dangers (2nd Tr., §&amp;nbsp;123). Finally, the proper alternative to the natural state is not political dictatorship/tyranny but democratically elected government and the effective protection of basic human rights to life, liberty, and property under the rule of law.

Nobody in the natural state has the political power to tell others what to do. However, everybody has the right to authoritatively pronounce justice and administer punishment for breaches of the natural law. Thus, men are not free to do whatever they please.  "The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges every one: and reason, which is that law, teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that... no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (2nd Tr., §&amp;nbsp;6).  The specifics of this law are unwritten, however, and so each is likely to misapply it in his own case.  Lacking any commonly recognised, impartial judge, there is no way to correct these misapplications or to effectively restrain those who violate the law of nature.

The law of nature is therefore ill enforced in the state of nature.
&lt;blockquote&gt;IF man in the state of nature be so free, as has been said; if he be absolute lord of his own person and possessions, equal to the greatest, and subject to no body, why will he part with his freedom? Why will he give up this empire, and subject himself to the dominion and control of any other power? To which it is obvious to answer, that though in the state of nature he hath such a right, yet the enjoyment of it is very uncertain, and constantly exposed to the invasion of others: for all being kings as much as he, every man his equal, and the greater part no strict observers of equity and justice, the enjoyment of the property he has in this state is very unsafe, very unsecure. This makes him willing to quit a condition, which, however free, is full of fears and continual dangers: and it is not without reason, that he seeks out, and is willing to join in society with others, who are already united, or have a mind to unite, for the mutual preservation of their lives, liberties and estates, which I call by the general name, property.  (2nd Tr., §&amp;nbsp;123)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is to avoid the state of war that often occurs in the state of nature, and to protect their [[private property]] that men enter into civil or political society, i.e., state of society.

===Conquest and slavery===
Ch. 4 ("Of Slavery") and Ch. 16 ("Of Conquest") are sources of some confusion:  the former provides a justification for [[slavery]], the latter, the [[Right of conquest|rights of conquerors]]. Because the ''[[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]]'' provided that a master had perfect authority over his slaves, some{{who|date=January 2014}} have taken these chapters to be an [[apologetics|apology]] for the institution of [[slavery in Colonial America]].

Most Locke scholars{{who|date=January 2014}} roundly reject this reading, as it is directly at odds with the text. The extent of Locke's involvement in drafting the ''Fundamental Constitutions'' is a matter of some debate, but even attributing full culpability for its contents and for his having profited from the [[Atlantic slave trade]], the majority of experts will concede that Locke may have been a hypocrite in this matter, but are adamant that no part of the ''Two Treatises'' can be used to provide theoretical support for slavery by bare right of conquest.

In the rhetoric of 17th-century England, those who opposed the increasing power of the kings claimed that the country was headed for a condition of slavery. Locke therefore asks, facetiously, under what conditions such slavery might be justified. He notes that slavery cannot come about as a matter of contract (which became the basis of Locke's political system). To be a slave is to be subject to the absolute, arbitrary power of another; as men do not have this power even over themselves, they cannot sell or otherwise grant it to another. One that is deserving of death, i.e., who has violated the [[natural law|law of nature]], may be enslaved. This is, however, but the state of war continued (2nd Tr., §&amp;nbsp;24), and even one justly a slave therefore has no obligation to obedience.

In providing a justification for slavery, he has rendered all forms of slavery as it actually exists invalid. Moreover, as one may not submit to slavery, there is a moral injunction to attempt to throw off and escape it whenever it looms. Most scholars take this to be Locke's point regarding slavery:  submission to [[absolute monarchy]] is a violation of the law of nature, for one does not have the right to enslave oneself.

The legitimacy of an [[List of British monarchs|English king]] depended on (somehow) demonstrating descent from [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]]:  the [[right of conquest]] was therefore a topic rife with constitutional connotations. Locke does not say that all subsequent English monarchs have been illegitimate, but he does make their rightful authority dependent solely upon their having acquired the people's approbation.

Locke first argues that, clearly, aggressors in an unjust war can claim no right of conquest:  everything they despoil may be retaken as soon as the dispossessed have the strength to do so.  Their children retain this right, so an ancient usurpation does not become lawful with time.  The rest of the chapter then considers what rights a just conqueror might have.

The argument proceeds negatively:  Locke proposes one power a conqueror could gain, and then demonstrates how in point of fact that power cannot be claimed.  He gains no authority over those that conquered with him, for they did not wage war unjustly:  thus, whatever other right William may have had in England, he could not claim kingship over his fellow [[Normans]] by right of conquest. The subdued are under the conqueror's despotical authority, but only those who actually took part in the fighting. Those who were governed by the defeated aggressor do not become subject to the authority of the victorious aggressor. They lacked the power to do an unjust thing, and so could not have granted that power to their governors:  the aggressor therefore was not acting as their representative, and they cannot be punished for his actions.  And while the conqueror may seize the person of the vanquished aggressor in an unjust war, he cannot seize the latter's property:  he may not drive the innocent wife and children of a villain into poverty for another's unjust acts. While the property is technically that of the defeated, his innocent dependents have a claim that the just conqueror must honour.  He cannot seize more than the vanquished could forfeit, and the latter had no right to ruin his dependents.  (He may, however, demand and take reparations for the damages suffered in the war, so long as these leave enough in the possession of the aggressor's dependants for their survival).

In so arguing, Locke accomplishes two objectives.  First, he neutralises the claims of those who see all authority flowing from William I by the latter's right of conquest.  In the absence of any other claims to authority (e.g., [[Robert Filmer|Filmer]]'s [[primogeniture]] from [[Adam and Eve|Adam]], [[divine right of kings|divine]] [[anointing|anointment]], etc.), all kings would have to found their authority on the [[consent of the governed]]. Second, he removes much of the incentive for conquest in the first place, for even in a just war the spoils are limited to the persons of the defeated and reparations sufficient only to cover the costs of the war, and even then only when the aggressor's territory can easily sustain such costs (i.e., it can never be a profitable endeavour). Needless to say, the bare claim that one's spoils are the just compensation for a just war does not suffice to make it so, in Locke's view.

===Property===

In the ''Second Treatise'', Locke claims that [[civil society]] was created for the protection of [[property]].&lt;ref&gt;Second Treatise, Sec. 85&lt;/ref&gt; In saying this, he relies on the etymological root of "property," [[Latin]] ''proprius'', or what is one's own, including oneself (cf. French ''propre''). Thus, by "property" he means "life, liberty, and estate."  By saying that political society was established for the better protection of property, he claims that it serves the private (and non-political) interests of its constituent members: it does not promote some good that can be realised only in community with others (e.g., virtue).

For this account to work, individuals must possess some property outside of society, i.e., in the [[state of nature]]:  the state cannot be the sole origin of property, declaring what belongs to whom. If the purpose of government is the protection of property, the latter must exist independently of the former. [[Sir Robert Filmer|Filmer]] had said that, if there even were a state of nature (which he denied), everything would be held in common:  there could be no private property, and hence no justice or injustice (injustice being understood as treating someone else's goods, liberty, or life as if it were one's own).  [[Thomas Hobbes]] had argued the same thing. Locke therefore provides an account of how material property could arise in the absence of government.

He begins by asserting that each individual, at a minimum, "owns" himself; this is a corollary of each individual's being free and equal in the state of nature. As a result, each must also own his own labour:  to deny him his labour would be to make him a slave.  One can therefore take items from the common store of goods by mixing one's labour with them:  an apple on the tree is of no use to anyone—it must be picked to be eaten—and the picking of that apple makes it one's own.  In an alternate argument, Locke claims that we must allow it to become private property lest all mankind have starved, despite the bounty of the world.  A man must be allowed to eat, and thus have what he has eaten be his own (such that he could deny others a right to use it).  The apple is surely his when he swallows it, when he chews it, when he bites into it, when he brings it to his mouth, etc.:  it became his as soon as he mixed his labour with it (by picking it from the tree).

This does not yet say ''why'' an individual is allowed to take from the common store of nature.  There is a necessity to do so to eat, but this does not yet establish why others must respect one's property, especially as they labour under the like necessity.  Locke assures his readers that the [[state of nature]] is a state of plenty:  one may take from communal store if one leaves a) enough and b) as good for others, and since nature is bountiful, one can take all that one can use without taking anything ''from'' someone else.  Moreover, one can take only so much as one can use before it spoils.  There are then two provisos regarding what one can take, the "enough and as good" condition and "spoilage."

Gold does not rot.  Neither does silver, or any other precious metal or gem.  They are, moreover, useless, their aesthetic value not entering into the equation.  One can heap up as much of them as one wishes, or take them in trade for food.  By the tacit consent of mankind, they become a form of money (one accepts gold in exchange for apples with the understanding that someone else will accept that gold in exchange for wheat).  One can therefore avoid the spoilage limitation by selling all that one has amassed before it rots; the limits on acquisition thus disappear.

In this way, Locke argues that a full economic system could, in principle, exist within the [[state of nature]]. Property could therefore predate the existence of government, and thus society can be dedicated to the protection of property.

===Representative government===
Locke did not demand a republic. Rather, Locke felt that a legitimate contract could easily exist between citizens and a monarchy, an oligarchy or some mixed form (''2nd Tr.'', sec. 132). Locke uses the term Common-wealth to mean "not a democracy, or any form of government, but any independent community" (sec. 133) and "whatever form the Common-wealth is under, the Ruling Power ought to govern by declared and received laws, and not by extemporary dictates and undetermined resolutions." (sec 137)

Locke does, however, make a distinction between an executive (e.g. a monarchy), a "Power always in being" (sec 144) that must perpetually execute the law, and the legislative that is the "supreme power of the Common-wealth" (sec 134) and does not have to be always in being. (sec 153) Furthermore, governments are charged by the consent of the individual, "i.e. the consent of the majority, giving it either by themselves, or their representatives chosen by them." (sec 140)

His notions of people's rights and the role of civil government provided strong support for the intellectual movements of both revolutions.

===Right of revolution===
The concept of the right of revolution was also taken up by John Locke in ''Two Treatises of Government'' as part of his [[social contract]] theory.  Locke declared that under [[natural law]], all [[people]] have the right to [[life]], [[liberty]], and [[estate (law)|estate]]; under the social contract, the people could instigate a [[revolution]] against the government when it acted against the interests of [[citizenship|citizens]], to replace the government with one that served the interests of citizens.  In some cases, Locke deemed revolution an obligation.  The right of revolution thus essentially acted as a safeguard against [[tyrant|tyranny]].

Locke affirmed an explicit right to revolution in ''Two Treatises of Government'': “''whenever the Legislators endeavor to take away, and destroy the Property of the People'', or to reduce them to Slavery under Arbitrary Power, they put themselves into a state of War with the People, who are thereupon absolved from any farther Obedience, and are left to the common Refuge, which God hath provided for all Men, against Force and Violence. Whensoever therefore the ''Legislative'' shall transgress this fundamental Rule of Society; and either by Ambition, Fear, Folly or Corruption, ''endeavor to grasp'' themselves, ''or put into the hands of any other an Absolute Power'' over the Lives, Liberties, and Estates of the People; By this breach of Trust ''they forfeit the Power'', the People had put into their hands, for quite contrary ends, and it devolves to the People, who have a Right to resume their original Liberty.” (sec. 222) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/john-locke-natural-rights-to-life-liberty-and-property#axzz2qx7Z9g7e Powell, Jim (1 August 1996): "John Locke: Natural Rights to Life, Liberty, and Property".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204014810/http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/john-locke-natural-rights-to-life-liberty-and-property |date=4 February 2014 }} In: ''The Freemann''.

==Reception and influence==

===Britain===
Although the ''Two Treatises'' would become well known in the second half of the 18th century, they were somewhat neglected when published. Between 1689 and 1694, around 200 tracts and treatises were published concerning the legitimacy of the [[Glorious Revolution]]. Three of these mention Locke, two of which were written by friends of Locke.&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, Mark. “Introduction.” ''The Reception of Locke's Politics''. 6 vols. London: Pickering &amp; Chatto (1999), xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] published the ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' in 1651, by contrast, dozens of texts were immediately written in response to it. As [[Mark Goldie]] explains: "''Leviathan'' was a monolithic and unavoidable presence for political writers in Restoration England in a way that in the first half of the eighteenth the ''Two Treatises'' was not."&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, "Introduction," xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the ''Two Treatises'' did not become popular until the 1760s, ideas from them did start to become important earlier in the century. According to Goldie, "the crucial moment was 1701" and "the occasion was the [[Kentish petition]]." The pamphlet war that ensued was one of the first times Locke's ideas were invoked in a public debate, most notably by [[Daniel Defoe]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, "Introduction," xxxi.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke's ideas did not go unchallenged and the periodical ''The Rehearsal'', for example, launched a "sustained and sophisticated assault” against the ''Two Treatises'' and endorsed the ideology of patriarchalism.&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, "Introduction," xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did patriarchalism continue to be a legitimate political theory in the 18th century, but as J. G. A. Pocock and others have gone to great lengths to demonstrate, so was [[civic humanism]] and [[classical republicanism]]. Pocock has argued that Locke's ''Two Treatises'' had very little effect on British political theory; he maintains that there was no contractarian revolution. Rather, he sees these other long-standing traditions as far more important for 18th-century British politics.&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, "Introduction," xxviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 18th century, Locke's position as a political philosopher suddenly rose in prominence. For example, he was invoked by those arguing on behalf of the American colonies during the [[Stamp Act]] debates of 1765–66.&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, "Introduction," xxxv.&lt;/ref&gt; Marginalized groups such as women, [[nonconformism|Dissenters]] and those campaigning to abolish the [[slavery|slave trade]] all invoked Lockean ideals. But at the same time, as Goldie describes it, "a wind of doubt about Locke's credentials gathered into a storm. The sense that Locke's philosophy had been misappropriated increasingly turned to a conviction that it was erroneous.”&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, "Introduction, xxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1790s Locke was associated with [[Rousseau]] and [[Voltaire]] and being blamed for the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s as well as for the perceived secularisation of society.&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, "Introduction," xxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1815, Locke's portrait was taken down from Christ Church, his alma mater (it was later restored to a position of prominence, and currently hangs in the dining hall of the college).

===North America===
Locke's influence during the American Revolutionary period is disputed. While it is easy to point to specific instances of Locke's ''Two Treatises'' being invoked, the extent of the acceptance of Locke's ideals and the role they played in the [[American Revolution]] are far from clear. The ''Two Treatises'' are echoed in phrases in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and writings by [[Samuel Adams]] that attempted to gain support for the rebellion. Of Locke's influence [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote: "[[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception, and as having laid the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical &amp; Moral sciences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Letters of Thomas Jefferson: 1743–1826 Bacon, Locke, and Newton |url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/P/tj3/writings/brf/jefl74.htm |publisher= |accessdate=2009-07-12 |quote=Bacon, Locke and Newton, whose pictures I will trouble you to have copied for me: and as I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception, and as having laid the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical &amp; Moral sciences. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20090615160740/http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/P/tj3/writings/brf/jefl74.htm |archivedate=15 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://explorer.monticello.org/text/index.php?id=82&amp;type=4 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112020132/http://explorer.monticello.org/text/index.php?id=82&amp;type=4 |archivedate=12 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }} Jefferson called Bacon, Newton, and Locke, who had so indelibly shaped his ideas, "my trinity of the three greatest men the world had ever produced"&lt;/ref&gt; The colonists frequently cited [[William Blackstone|Blackstone's]] ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', which synthesised Lockean political philosophy with the [[common law]] tradition. [[Louis Hartz]], writing at the beginning of the 20th century, took it for granted that Locke was the political philosopher of the revolution.

This view was challenged by [[Bernard Bailyn]] and [[Gordon S. Wood]], who argued that the revolution was not a struggle over property, taxation, and rights, but rather "a Machiavellian effort to preserve the young republic's 'virtue' from the corrupt and corrupting forces of English politics."&lt;ref name="GoldieIntroduction"&gt;Goldie, "Introduction," liii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Garry Wills]], on the other hand, maintains that it was neither the Lockean tradition nor the classical republican tradition that drove the revolution, but instead Scottish moral philosophy, a political philosophy that based its conception of society on friendship, [[sensibility]] and the controlled passions.&lt;ref name="GoldieIntroduction" /&gt; [[Thomas Pangle]] and [[Michael Zuckert]] have countered, demonstrating numerous elements in the thought of more influential founders that have a Lockean pedigree.&lt;ref&gt;Pangle, ''Spirit of Modern Republicanism''; Zuckert, ''Launching Liberalism'', ''Natural Rights Republic''.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that there is no conflict between Lockean thought and classical Republicanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Zuckert |1994|loc=chpt. 7–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huyler 1995 loc=chpt. 4,5"&gt;{{harvnb| Huyler |1995|loc=chpt. 4,5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Natural Rights Liberalism from Locke to Nozick |editor=Ellen Frankel Paul |editor2=Fred D.

==Controversies regarding interpretation==
Locke’s political philosophy is often compared and contrasted with [[Thomas Hobbes]]’ ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''. The motivation in both cases is self-preservation with Hobbes arguing the need of an absolute monarch to prevent the war of “all against all” inherent in anarchy while Locke argues that the protection of life, liberty, and property can be achieved by a parliamentary process that protects, not violates, one’s rights.

[[Leo Strauss]] and [[C. B. Macpherson]] stress the continuity of thought. In their view Locke and Hobbes describe an atomistic man largely driven by a hedonistic materialistic acquisitiveness. Strauss’ Locke is little more than Hobbes in “sheep’s clothing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Huyler |1995|pp=13, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt; C. B. Macpherson argued in his ''Political Theory of Possessive Individualism'' that Locke sets the stage for unlimited acquisition and appropriation of property by the powerful creating gross inequality. Government is the protector of interests of capitalists while the “labouring class [are] not considered to have an interest.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Huyler |1995|pp=102, 120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Macpherson | 1962 |p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Macpherson, [[James Tully (philosopher)|James Tully]] finds no evidence that Locke specifically advocates capitalism. In his ''A Discourse on Property'', Tully describes Locke’s view of man as a social dependent, with Christian sensibilities, and a God-given duty to care for others. Property, in Tully’s explanation of Locke, belong to the community as the public commons but becomes “private” so long as the property owner, or more correctly the “custodian,” serves the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Huyler |1995|pp=130–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckert believes Tully is reading into Locke rights and duties that just aren’t there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Zuckert |1994|p=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huyler finds that Locke explicitly condemned government privileges for rich, contrary to Macpherson’s pro-capitalism critique, but also rejected subsidies to aid the poor, in contrast to Tully’s social justice apologetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Huyler |1995|pp=162–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cambridge School of political thought, led principally by [[Quentin Skinner]], [[J. G. A. Pocock]], Richard Ashcraft, and [[Peter Laslett]], uses a historical methodology to situate Locke in the ''political'' context of his times. But they also restrict his importance to those times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Huyler |1995|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashcraft’s Locke takes the side of the burgeoning merchant class against the aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ashcraft|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neal Wood]] puts Locke on the side of the agrarian interests, not the manufacturing bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Huyler |1995|pp=104–05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerome Huyler and Michael. P. Zuckert approach Locke in the broader context of his oeuvre and historical influence. Locke is situated within changing religious, philosophical, scientific, and political dimensions of 17th century England. Objecting to the use of the contemporary concept of [[economic man]] to describe Locke’s view of human nature, Huyler emphases the “virtue of industriousness” of Locke’s Protestant England. Productive work is man’s earthly function or calling, ordained by God and required by self-preservation. The government’s protection of property rights insures that the results of industry, i.e. “fruits of one’s labor,” are secure. Locke’s prohibition of ill-gotten gains, whether for well-connected gentry or the profligate, is not a lack of Locke’s foresight to the problems in the latter stages of liberalism but an application of equal protection of the law to every individual.&lt;ref name="Huyler 1995 loc=chpt. 4,5" /&gt;

[[Richard Pipes]] argues that Locke holds a [[labor theory of value]] that leads to the socialist critique that those not engaging in physical labor exploit wage earners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pipes |first=Richard |title=Property and Freedom |page=36 |year=1999 |publisher=Knopf |isbn=978-0375404986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huyler, relying on Locke’s ''Essays on the Law of Nature'' shows that reason is the most fundamental virtue, underwrites all productive virtue, and leads to human [[Eudaimonia|flourishing]] or happiness in an [[Aristotle|Aristotelean]] sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Huyler |1995|loc=chpt. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The UN Counter-Terrorism Office''' was approved in a resolution on June 15, 2017 with the consensus of the 193-nation [[UN General Assembly]]. The creation of the office was also welcomed by [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[António Guterres]]' initiative to transfer relevant functions out of the UN [[Department of Political Affairs]] (DPA) and into the new United Nations Office of [[Counter-Terrorism]].&lt;ref name="un"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/general-assembly-approves-creation-new-un-counter-terrorism-office|title=General Assembly approves creation of new UN Counter-Terrorism Office &amp;#124; Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force|website=un.org|accessdate=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Chief UN spokesman [[Stephane Dujarric]], the secretary-general welcomed the adoption of the General Assembly resolution "which endorsed his proposal to establish a new UN Office of Counter-Terrorism."
"The Secretary-General considers counter-terrorism and prevention of [[violent extremism]] to be one of the highest priorities of the [[United Nations]] to address a growing threat to international peace and security," Dujarric said.
"He therefore hopes that this reform of the UN Counter-Terrorism architecture will contribute to the UN's broader efforts to promote conflict prevention, sustainable peace and development”, he added.&lt;ref name="un2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/counterterrorism/|website=un.org|title=United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism|accessdate=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Venn 0111 1111.svg|thumb|200px|Union of three sets:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;~A \cup B \cup C&lt;/math&gt;]]
[[File:Example of a non pairwise disjoint family of sets.svg|200px|thumb|The union of A, B, C, D, and E is everything except the white area.]]
In [[set theory]], the '''union''' (denoted by ∪) of a collection of sets is the set of all [[element (set theory)|element]]s in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Union.html|title=Union|author=Weisstein, Eric W|publisher=Wolfram's Mathworld|accessdate=2009-07-14|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207202412/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Union.html|archivedate=2009-02-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the fundamental operations through which sets can be combined and related to each other.

For explanation of the symbols used in this article, refer to the [[List of mathematical symbols|table of mathematical symbols]].

== Union of two sets ==
The union of two sets ''A'' and ''B'' is the set of elements which are in ''A'', in ''B'', or in both ''A'' and ''B''.  In symbols,

:&lt;math&gt;A  \cup B = \{ x: x \in A \text{  or  } x \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LBvpfEMhurwC|title=Basic Set Theory|last=Vereshchagin|first=Nikolai Konstantinovich|last2=Shen|first2=Alexander|date=2002-01-01|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=9780821827314|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if ''A'' = {1, 3, 5, 7} and ''B'' = {1, 2, 4, 6} then ''A'' ∪ ''B'' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.  A more elaborate example (involving two infinite sets) is:
: ''A'' = {''x'' is an even [[integer]] larger than 1}
: ''B'' = {''x'' is an odd integer larger than 1}
: &lt;math&gt;A \cup B = \{2,3,4,5,6, \dots\}&lt;/math&gt;

As another example, the number 9 is ''not'' contained in the union of the set of [[prime number]]s {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, …} and the set of [[even number]]s {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, …}, because 9 is neither prime nor even.

Sets cannot have duplicate elements,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hM3-xxZC-8C&amp;pg=PA24|title=Applied Mathematics for Database Professionals|last=deHaan|first=Lex|last2=Koppelaars|first2=Toon|date=2007-10-25|publisher=Apress|isbn=9781430203483|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the union of the sets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4} is {1, 2, 3, 4}. Multiple occurrences of identical elements have no effect on the [[cardinality]] of a set or its contents.

== Algebraic properties ==
Binary union is an [[associative]] operation; that is, for any sets ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'',

:&lt;math&gt;A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup C.&lt;/math&gt;

The operations can be performed in any order, and the parentheses may be omitted without ambiguity (i.e., either of the above can be expressed equivalently as ''A'' ∪ ''B'' ∪ ''C''). Similarly, union is [[commutative]], so the sets can be written in any order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jV_aBwAAQBAJ|title=Naive Set Theory|last=Halmos|first=P. R.|date=2013-11-27|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781475716450|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[empty set]] is an [[identity element]] for the operation of union. That is, ''A'' ∪ ∅ = ''A'', for any set ''A.'' This follows from analogous facts about [[logical disjunction]].

Since sets with unions and intersections form a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] distributes over union
:&lt;math&gt;A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B)\cup(A \cap C)&lt;/math&gt; 
and union distributes over intersection
:&lt;math&gt;A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)&lt;/math&gt; .

Within a given [[universe (mathematics)|universal set]], union can be written in terms of the operations of intersection and [[complement (set theory)|complement]] as
:&lt;math&gt;A \cup B = \left(A^C \cap B^C \right)^C&lt;/math&gt;
where the superscript &lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the complement with respect to the universal set.

== Finite unions ==
One can take the union of several sets simultaneously.  For example, the union of three sets ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' contains all elements of ''A'', all elements of ''B'', and all elements of ''C'', and nothing else. Thus, ''x'' is an element of ''A'' ∪ ''B'' ∪ ''C'' if and only if ''x'' is in at least one of ''A'', ''B'', and ''C''.

In mathematics a '''finite union''' means any union carried out on a finite number of sets; it does not imply that the union set is a [[finite set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u06-BAAAQBAJ|title=Set Theory: With an Introduction to Real Point Sets|last=Dasgupta|first=Abhijit|date=2013-12-11|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781461488545|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Finite_Union_of_Finite_Sets_is_Finite|title=Finite Union of Finite Sets is Finite - ProofWiki|author=|date=|website=proofwiki.org|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911224545/https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Finite_Union_of_Finite_Sets_is_Finite|archivedate=11 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arbitrary unions ==

The most general notion is the union of an arbitrary collection of sets, sometimes called an ''infinitary union''. If '''M''' is a set or [[Class (set theory)|class]] whose elements are sets, then ''x'' is an element of the union of '''M''' [[if and only if]] there is [[existential quantification|at least one]] element ''A'' of '''M''' such that ''x'' is an element of ''A''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DOUbCgAAQBAJ|title=A Transition to Advanced Mathematics|last=Smith|first=Douglas|last2=Eggen|first2=Maurice|last3=Andre|first3=Richard St|date=2014-08-01|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781285463261|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In symbols:
: &lt;math&gt;x \in \bigcup \mathbf{M} \iff \exists A \in \mathbf{M},\ x \in A.&lt;/math&gt;
This idea subsumes the preceding sections—for example, ''A'' ∪ ''B'' ∪ ''C'' is the union of the collection {''A'', ''B'', ''C''}. Also, if '''M''' is the empty collection, then the union of '''M''' is the empty set.

=== Notations ===
The notation for the general concept can vary considerably.  For a finite union of sets &lt;math&gt;S_1, S_2, S_3, \dots , S_n&lt;/math&gt; one often writes &lt;math&gt;S_1 \cup S_2 \cup S_3 \cup \dots \cup S_n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i=1}^n S_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Various common notations for arbitrary unions include  &lt;math&gt;\bigcup \mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{A\in\mathbf{M}} A&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i\in I} A_{i}&lt;/math&gt;, the last of which refers to the union of the collection &lt;math&gt;\left\{A_i : i \in I\right\}&lt;/math&gt; where ''I'' is an [[index set]] and &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; is a set for every &lt;math&gt;i \in I&lt;/math&gt;. In the case that the index set ''I'' is the set of [[natural number]]s, one uses a notation &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_{i}&lt;/math&gt; analogous to that of the [[series (mathematics)|infinite series]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

When the symbol "∪" is placed before other symbols instead of between them, it is usually rendered as a larger size.

The concept of '''universal suffrage''', also known as '''general suffrage''' or '''common suffrage''', consists of the [[Suffrage|right to vote]] of all adult [[citizenship|citizens]], regardless of property ownership, income,  [[race (human classification)|race]], or ethnicity, subject only to minor exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/universal-suffrage Collins Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brit"&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/suffrage Suffrage], ''Encyclopedia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt; In its original 19th-century usage by [[political reform]]ers, ''universal suffrage'' was understood to mean only [[universal male suffrage]]; the vote was extended to women later, during the [[women's suffrage]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Roberts, ''Sophia Jex-Blake: A Woman Pioneer in Nineteenth Century Medical Reform'' (Routledge, 1993), p. 1: "Although political reformers from [[John Wilkes]] onward had pressed for 'universal suffrage' they and their followers all understood the term to mean 'universal 'male suffrage.'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Justin Goldstein, ''Political Repression in 19th Century Europe'' (Routledge, 1983): "the great majority of European countries adopted highly discriminatory suffrage systems for lower legislative chambers for most or all of the 1815-1915 period. Universal male suffrage (which is what was meant when universal suffrage was discussed) at age 21 would have enfranchised about 25 per cent of the European population during the nineteenth century."&lt;/ref&gt;

There are variations among countries in terms of specifics of the right to vote; the minimum age is usually between 18 and 25 years (see [[age of majority]]) and "the insane, certain classes of convicted criminals, and those punished for certain electoral offenses" sometimes lack the right to vote.&lt;ref name="Brit"/&gt;

In the [[United States]], the term "suffrage" is often associated specifically with [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]]; a movement to extend the franchise to women began in the mid-nineteenth century and culminated in the 1920, when the United States ratified the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], guaranteeing the right of women to vote.

[[File:First Female Parliamentarians in the world in Finland in 1907.jpg|thumbnail|The first female MPs in the world were elected in Finland in 1907.]]

In most countries, universal suffrage (the right to vote but not necessarily the right to be a candidate) followed about a generation after universal male suffrage. Notable exceptions in Europe were France, where women could not vote until 1944, Greece (1952), and Switzerland (1971).

In the first modern [[democracies]], governments restricted the vote to those with property and wealth, which almost always meant a minority of the male population. In some jurisdictions, other restrictions existed, such as requiring voters to practice a given religion. In all modern democracies, the number of people who could vote has increased progressively with time. In the 19th century in Europe, Great Britain and North America, there were movements advocating "universal [male] suffrage".

==Expanding suffrage==
[[File:Election MG 3455.JPG|thumb|Voting is an important part of the formal [[democratic process]].]]
[[File:Hemicycle of Louise Weiss building of the European Parliament, Strasbourg.jpg|thumb|The [[European Parliament]] is the only supranational organ elected with universal suffrage (since 1979).]]
France, under the [[French Constitution of 1793|1793 Jacobin constitution]], was the first major country to enact suffrage for all adult males, though it was never formally enacted in practice (the [[French Directory election, 1795|subsequent election]] occurring after the [[Thermidorian Reaction|fall of the Jacobin government]]). The [[Second French Republic]] did institute adult male suffrage after the [[French Revolution of 1848|revolution of 1848]].

Following the French revolutions, the first movements in the Western world toward universal suffrage occurred in the early 19th century, and focused on removing property requirements for voting. In 1867, Germany (the [[North German Confederation]]) enacted suffrage for all adult males. In the United States following the [[American Civil War]], slaves were freed and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|granted rights of citizens]], including [[Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|suffrage for adult males]] (although several states established restrictions largely, though not completely, diminishing these rights). In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the focus of the [[Suffragettes|universal suffrage movement]] came to include the extension of the [[Women's suffrage|right to vote to women]], as happened from the post-Civil War era in several Western states and the 1890s in a number of British colonies.

In 1906, the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], which became the republic of Finland, was the first country in the world to implement full universal suffrage, as women could stand as candidates, unlike in New Zealand, and ethnic exclusion was not implemented, unlike in Australia. It also elected the world's first female members of parliament [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1907|the following year]].&lt;ref name="eduskunta.fi"&gt;[https://www.eduskunta.fi/EN/tietoaeduskunnasta/historia/Pages/default.aspx Brief history of the Finnish Parliament]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091011200547/http://www.aanioikeus.fi/en/articles/strike.htm Centenary of women's full political rights in Finland]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First French Republic]] was the second nation that adopted universal male suffrage, doing so in 1792; it was one of the first national systems that abolished all property requirements as a prerequisite for allowing men to register and vote. Greece recognized full male suffrage in 1830. Spain recognized it in the [[Constitution of 1869]] and France and Switzerland have continuously done so since the [[1848 Revolution]] (for resident male citizens). Upon independence in the 19th century, several Latin American countries and Liberia in Africa initially extended suffrage to all adult males, but subsequently restricted it based on property requirements. The [[German Empire]] implemented full male suffrage in 1871.{{citation needed|reason=Any documents for this that specify who got the vote and to which duties it was tied to, if any?|date=June 2016}} 

In the United States, the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1870 during the [[Reconstruction era]], provided that "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude." This amendment was intended to guarantee the right to vote to [[African Americans]], many of whom had been [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] in the [[Southern United States|South]] prior to the end of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|abolition of slavery]]. Despite the amendment, however, [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|blacks were disfranchised]] in the former Confederate states [[Compromise of 1877|after 1877]]; Southern officials ignored the amendment and blocked black citizens from voting through a variety of devices, including [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll taxes]], [[literacy tests]], and [[grandfather clause]]s;&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;Chandler Davidson, "The Recent Evolution of Voting Rights Law Affecting Racial and Language Minorities"  in ''Quiet Revolution in the South: The Impact of the Voting Rights Act, 1965-1990'' (Princeton University Press, 1994: eds. Chandler Davidson &amp; Bernard Grofman), pp. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; violence and terrorism were used to intimidate those who attempted to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Gershman, "Fifteenth Amendment (1870)" in ''Race and Racism in the United States: An Encyclopedia of the American Mosaic'' (eds. Charles A. Gallagher, Cameron D. Lippard), pp. 441-43.&lt;/ref&gt; Southern blacks did not effectively receive the right to vote until the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].&lt;ref name="Davidson"/&gt;

In 1893, the self-governing colony New Zealand became the first country in the world (except for the short-lived [[18th century]] [[Corsican Republic]]) to grant active universal suffrage by giving women the right to vote. It did not grant universal full suffrage (the right to both vote and be a candidate, or both active and passive suffrage) until 1919.&lt;ref name="Nohlen" /&gt;

In 1902, Australia become the first country to grant full suffrage for women, i.e. the first country in the world to give women both the right to vote and to run for office.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/austn-suffragettes&lt;/ref&gt; However, universal suffrage was not implemented, as [[Aboriginal Australians|aboriginals]] did not get the right to vote until 1962.

Several European nations that had enacted universal suffrage had their normal legal process, or their status as an independent nation, interrupted during and after the [[First World War]].

Many societies in the past have denied or abridged political representation on the basis of race or ethnicity, related to discriminatory ideas about citizenship. For example, in [[apartheid]]-era [[South Africa]], non-[[white people]] could generally not vote in national elections until the first [[South African general election, 1994|multi-party elections in 1994]] (except under the [[Cape Qualified Franchise]], which was replaced by a number of [[Coloured vote constitutional crisis|separate MPs]] in 1936 (Blacks) and 1958 (Coloureds), later by the [[Tricameral Parliament]]). Rhodesia enacted a similar statute in [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|its proclaimed independence]], which however allowed a smaller number of representatives for the considerably larger Black majority (under its 1961 constitution, the voting classes had been based on socio-economic standards, which marginalized most Black and a few White voters to a separate set of constituencies, under the principle of [[weighted voting]]; this replaced in 1969 by an openly racial franchise, with delegated all Blacks to the 'B' voters roll).

==Disfranchisement==
{{Youth rights sidebar}}
{{main article|Disfranchisement}}
All US states, with the exceptions of Maine and Vermont, disfranchise some felons from voting depending on their current incarceration, parole or probation status; a number of US states permanently disfranchise some felons, even after their release from prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://felonvoting.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=286 Procon.org – State Felon Voting Laws]&lt;/ref&gt; Many states within the U.S. previously disfranchised [[pauper]]s, persons who either paid no direct taxes, or received public assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Robert J. |last=Steinfeld |doi=10.2307/1228746 |title=Property and Suffrage in the Early American Republic |journal=[[Stanford Law Review]] |volume=41 |issue=2 |year=1989 |pages=335–376, p.&amp;nbsp;335 ''et passim'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nations have differing degrees of legal recognition of non-resident citizens: non-resident [[Denmark|Danes]] cannot vote after two years;&lt;ref name="danish-expat-vote"&gt;[http://valg.oim.dk/Vaelgere/Udlandsdanskeres-valgret.aspx Udlandsdanskeres Valgret (økonomi- og indenrigsministeriet)]&lt;/ref&gt; non-resident [[Italy|Italians]] may vote for representatives [[at-large]] in the [[Parliament of Italy|Italian parliament]]; non-resident British citizens cannot vote for their [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|national parliament]] unless they have lived in the UK within the last fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-02208.pdf Electoral Franchise: Who can vote] UK Parliament&lt;/ref&gt; A few nations also restrict those who are part of the military or police forces, e.g. [[Politics of Kuwait#Political parties and elections|Kuwait]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ku.html#Govt CIA – The World Factbook – Kuwait&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many democratic countries, for example the United Kingdom and France, have had colonies with citizens living outside of the mother country and have generally not been entitled to vote for the national legislature. A peculiarly complex case is that of [[Algeria]] under the [[Third French Republic]]: Algeria was legally an integral part of France, but citizenship was restricted (as in other French colonies proper) by legal status, not by race or ethnicity. Any Muslim Algerian could become a French citizen by choosing to live like one. As this required the person to resign jurisdiction under Islamic law in favour of French civic law, very few did. Among Muslims, such a change was considered [[apostasy from Islam]], which was the dominant religion in Algeria. Colonists in America declared Independence from Great Britain citing "No Taxation Without Representation" as one of their main grievances. However, the newly established country did not extend [[voting rights in the United States]] beyond white adult male property owners (about 6% of the population),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expansion of Rights and Liberties - The Right of Suffrage|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|website=Online Exhibit: The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did not grant its overseas citizens the right to vote in elections either, until the passage of the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act in 1986.

Citizens of an [[Member State of the European Union|EU Member State]] are allowed to vote in [[Elections in the European Union|EU parliamentary elections]], as well as some local elections. For example, a British person living in [[Graz]], [[Austria]], would be entitled to vote for the European Parliament as a resident of the "electoral district" of Austria, and to vote in Graz municipal elections. He would, however, not be entitled to vote in Austrian (federal) elections, or [[Styria]]n (state) elections. Similarly, all locally resident EU citizens in the UK are allowed to vote for representatives of the local council, and those resident in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland may vote for the devolved parliaments or assemblies. But, only British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens are allowed to vote for the [[British House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is eligible to vote at a UK general election?|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/faq/voting-and-registration/who-is-eligible-to-vote-at-a-uk-general-election|publisher=The Electoral Commission|postscript=none}}; {{cite web|title=Can I vote?|url=http://www.europarl.org.uk/en/your-meps/european_elections/can_i_vote.html|publisher=European Parliament Information Office in the United Kingdom|postscript=none}}; {{cite web|title=Why Can Commonwealth Citizens Vote in the U.K.?

In fact the British government is planning to reinstate universal suffrage soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expat vote ban lifted, but not in time for EU referendum|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/11633091/Expat-vote-ban-lifted-but-not-in-time-for-EU-referendum.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dates by country==
States have granted and revoked universal suffrage at various times. This list can be organised in three ways:
* '''Universal''' There are no distinctions between voters over a certain age in any part of its territories due to gender, literacy, wealth, social status, language, religion, race, or ethnicity.
* '''Male''' is for all males over a certain age irrespective of literacy, wealth, or social status.
* '''Female''' is for all women over a certain age irrespective of literacy, wealth, or social status.
* '''Ethnicity''' is for all eligible voters over a certain age irrespective of language, religion, race, or ethnicity.

The parliaments of the Colony of Victoria and the Colony of New South Wales followed suit by enacting legislation providing universal male suffrage in 1857 and 1858, respectively. In 1894 the parliament of the Colony of South Australia enacted legislation providing female adult franchise; the right of all white adults of the age of majority to vote in elections, and for any elector to stand for high office. In 1901, the self-governing colonies of Australia joined together in a federal structure of states. In 1902, the new federal parliament legislated for a white adult franchise and the right of electors to stand for and occupy any office for which they could directly vote. Indigenous people were explicitly excluded. True universal suffrage was not achieved until 1967 when the Commonwealth Electoral Act extended the right to vote to all Australians regardless of race.  However, Australia was first united as a federation in 1901&lt;ref&gt;[[History of Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}}.  Hence, white female voting rights were not enabled until the nation was united.

| In 1792, the Convention assembly was elected by all males 25 and over. Over the subsequent years, France experienced profound political upheaval, with republican, monarchist and bonapartist government governing at various times. Through these changes, suffrage increased and decreased based on the introduction, repeal and reintroduction of various degrees of universal, property and census-based suffrage. Universal male suffrage was given in 1848, with the exception of the military who obtained the right to vote in 1945. This was supplemented in 1944 by full universal suffrage, including women as voters.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

After the American Revolution, the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] did not originally define who was eligible to vote, allowing each state to determine who was eligible. In the early history of the U.S., most states allowed only white male adult property owners to vote (about 6% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expansion of Rights and Liberties - The Right of Suffrage|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|website=Online Exhibit: The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=April 21, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706144856/http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|archivedate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Kenneth|last1=Janda|first2=Jeffrey M.|last2=Berry|first3=Jerry|last3=Goldman|title=The challenge of democracy : government in America|date=2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|isbn=9780618990948|page=207|edition=9. ed., update|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQ_iZMofnl0C&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|postscript=none}}; {{cite book|last1=Murrin|first1=John M.|last2=Johnson|first2=Paul E.|last3=McPherson|first3=James M.|last4=Fahs|first4=Alice|last5=Gerstle|first5=Gary|title=Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People|date=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|isbn=9780495904991|page=296|edition=6th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGSQOiy6uZUC&amp;pg=PT337#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over subsequent decades, voting rights expanded to include more of the population. Vermont, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky were the three states to have full adult suffrage for white males before 1800. New Jersey allowed women's suffrage for landowners until the early 1800s.

In the [[United States presidential election, 1820|1820 election]], there were 108,359 ballots cast. In the [[United States presidential election, 1840|1840 election]], 2,412,694 ballots were cast, an increase that far outstripped natural population growth. Poor voters became a huge part of the electorate. By 1856, after the period of [[Jacksonian democracy]], all states had almost universal white adult male suffrage regardless of property ownership, although tax-paying requirements remained in five states, and two into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=NBER2005&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Stanley L.

In 1868, the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] altered the way each state is represented in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. It counted all residents for apportionment including former slaves, overriding the [[three-fifths compromise]], and reduced a state's apportionment if it wrongfully denied men aged 21 and above the right to vote. However, this was not enforced in practice. In 1870, the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]] granted suffrage to all males of any race, skin color, and ethnicity, including former slaves (freedmen), meaning that male African Americans in theory had the right to vote throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;David Quigley, Acts of Enforcement: The New York City Election of 1870, in: New York History (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1888, former Confederate states passed [[Jim Crow laws]] and amendments to effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchise]] black and poor white voters through [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]]es, [[literacy tests]], [[grandfather clauses]] and other restrictions, applied in a discriminatory manner. During this period, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] generally upheld state efforts to discriminate against racial minorities; only later in the 20th century were these laws ruled unconstitutional. Black males in the Northern states could vote, but the majority of African Americans lived in the South.

Wyoming was the first territory to enfranchise all women in 1869. From then until 1916, all Western states legalized women suffrage, but few Eastern states followed suit. However, in 1920 the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] extended the franchise to women in all states.&lt;ref&gt;Ashlyn K. Kuersten (2003).

==Women's suffrage==
{{main article|Women's suffrage}}
In [[Sweden-Finland]], women's suffrage was granted during the [[Age of Liberty]] from 1718 until 1772.&lt;ref&gt;Karlsson Sjögren, Åsa, Männen, kvinnorna och rösträtten: medborgarskap och representation 1723-1866 [Men, women and suffrage: citizenship and representation 1723-1866], Carlsson, Stockholm, 2006 (in Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Corsican Republic|Corsica]], women's suffrage was granted in 1755 and lasted until 1769.&lt;ref name="Kulinski"&gt;A. Kulinski, K. Pawlowski. "The Atlantic Community - The Titanic of the XXI Century". p. 96. WSB-NLU. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's suffrage (with the same property qualifications as for men) was granted in [[New Jersey]] in 1776 (the word "inhabitants" was used instead of "men" in the 1776 Constitution) and rescinded in 1807.

The [[Pitcairn Islands]] granted restricted women's suffrage in 1838. Various other countries and states granted restricted women's suffrage in the later half of the nineteenth century, starting with [[South Australia]] in 1861.

The first unrestricted women's suffrage in a major country was granted [[Women's suffrage in New Zealand|in New Zealand]] in 1893.&lt;ref name="Nohlen"&gt;{{cite work |last=Nohlen |first=Dieter |authorlink=Dieter Nohlen |date=2001 |title=Elections in Asia and the Pacific: South East Asia, East Asia, and the South Pacific |page=14 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women's suffrage bill was adopted mere weeks before the [[general election]] of 1893. Māori men had been granted suffrage in 1867, white men in 1879. The ''[[Freedom in the World]]'' index lists New Zealand as the only free country in the world in 1893.&lt;ref name="Kulinski"/&gt;

[[South Australia]] first granted women suffrage and allowed them to stand for parliament in 1894.

The autonomous [[Grand Principality of Finland]]&lt;!-- add here: (then an [[autonomy|autonomous]] part of the [[Russian Empire]])--&gt;, a decade before becoming the republic of Finland, was the first country in the world to implement full universal suffrage, by giving women full political rights, i.e. both the right to vote and to run for office, and was the second in the world and the first in Europe to give women the right to vote.&lt;ref name="eduskunta.fi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; The world's first female members of parliament were [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1907|elected]] in Finland the following year.

In 1931, the [[Second Spanish Republic]] allowed women the right of [[passive suffrage]] with three women being elected.

During a discussion on extending women's right to active suffrage, the Radical Socialist [[Victoria Kent]] confronted the Radical [[Clara Campoamor]]. Kent argued that Spanish women were not yet prepared to vote and, since they were too influenced by the [[Catholicism in the Second Spanish Republic|Catholic Church]], they would vote for right-wing candidates. Campoamor however pleaded for women's rights regardless of political orientation. Her point finally prevailed and, in the election of 1933, the political right won with the vote of citizens of any sex over 23. Both Campoamor and Kent lost their seats.

{{War}}

'''War''' is a state of armed conflict between [[State (polity)|states]], [[government]]s, [[Society|societies]] and informal [[paramilitary]] groups, such as [[mercenaries]], [[insurgent]]s and [[militia]]s. It is generally characterized by extreme [[violence]], [[aggression]], destruction, and mortality, using [[Regular army|regular]] or [[Irregular military|irregular]] [[military forces]]. '''Warfare''' refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warfare|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/warfare|website=Cambridge Dictionary|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Total war]] is warfare that is not restricted to purely [[legitimate military target]]s, and can result in massive [[civilian casualties|civilian]] or other [[non-combatant]] suffering and [[Casualty (person)|casualties]].

The [[war studies|scholarly study of war]] is sometimes called polemology ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɒ|l|ə|ˈ|m|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}} {{Respell|POL|ə|MOL|ə|jee}}), from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''polemos'', meaning "war", and ''[[-logy]]'', meaning "the study of".

==Etymology==
[[File:Gari-Melchers-War-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Mural of War (1896), by [[Gari Melchers]]]]
The English word ''war'' derives from the late [[Old English]] (circa.1050) words ''wyrre'' and ''werre'', from [[Old French]] ''werre'' (also ''guerre'' as in modern French), in turn from the [[Franks|Frankish]] *''werra'', ultimately deriving from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] *''werzō'' 'mixture, confusion'. The word is related to the [[Old Saxon]] ''werran'', [[Old High German]] ''werran'', and the German ''verwirren'', meaning “to confuse”, “to perplex”, and “to bring into confusion”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=war |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=war |year=2010 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
{{Main|Outline of war#Types of war|l1=Types of war}}

War must entail some degree of confrontation using weapons and other [[military technology and equipment]] by armed forces employing [[military tactics]] and [[operational art]] within a broad [[military strategy]] subject to [[military logistics]]. Studies of war by military theorists throughout [[military history]] have sought to identify the [[philosophy of war]], and to reduce it to a [[military science]]. Modern military science considers several factors before a [[Defence policy|national defence policy]] is created to allow a war to commence: the environment in the area(s) of combat operations, the posture national forces will adopt on the commencement of a war, and the type of warfare troops will be engaged in.
* [[Asymmetric warfare]] is a conflict between [[belligerent]]s of drastically different levels of military capability and/or size.
* [[Biological warfare]], or germ warfare, is the use of weaponized biological toxins or infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
* [[Chemical warfare]] involves the use of weaponized chemicals in combat. Poison gas as a [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapon]] was principally used during [[World War I]], and resulted in over a million estimated casualties, including more than 100,000 civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents, Second Edition |author=D. Hank Ellison |date=August 24, 2007 |pages=567–70 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-0-8493-1434-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Civil war]] is a war between forces belonging to the same nation or political entity.
* [[Conventional warfare]] is declared war between states in which [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]], [[biological weapon|biological]], or [[chemical weapons]] are not used or see limited deployment.
* [[Cyberwarfare]] involves the actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's information systems.
* [[Insurgency]] is a rebellion against authority, when those taking part in the rebellion are not recognized as belligerents (lawful combatants). An insurgency can be fought via counter-insurgency warfare, and may also be opposed by measures to protect the population, and by political and economic actions of various kinds aimed at undermining the insurgents' claims against the incumbent regime.
* [[Information warfare]] is the application of destructive force on a large scale against information assets and systems, against the [[computer]]s and [[Computer network|networks]] that support the four critical infrastructures (the power grid, communications, financial, and transportation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/eprint/snyder/infowarfare.htm |title=Information Warfare |last=Lewis |first=Brian C. |date= |website=Federation of American Scientist |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970617035106/http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/snyder/infowarfare.htm |archive-date=17 June 1997 |dead-url=yes |access-date=27 Feb 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nuclear warfare]] is warfare in which [[nuclear weapon]]s are the primary, or a major, method of achieving capitulation.
* [[Total war]] is warfare by any means possible, disregarding the [[laws of war]], placing no limits on [[legitimate military target]]s, using [[weapon]]s and [[Military tactics|tactics]] resulting in significant [[civilian casualties]], or demanding a [[war effort]] requiring significant sacrifices by the friendly civilian population.
* [[Unconventional warfare]], the opposite of conventional warfare, is an attempt to achieve military victory through acquiescence, capitulation, or clandestine support for one side of an existing conflict.
* [[War of aggression]] is a war for conquest or gain rather than self-defense; this can be the basis of [[war crime]]s under [[customary international law]].
* [[War of liberation]], Wars of national liberation or national liberation revolutions are conflicts fought by nations to gain independence. The term is used in conjunction with wars against foreign powers (or at least those perceived as foreign) to establish separate sovereign states for the rebelling nationality. From a different point of view, these wars are called insurgencies, rebellions, or wars of independence.

The lower figure is more plausible,&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Muehlenkamp, [http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/germs-vs-guns-or-death-from-mass.html 'Germs vs. guns, or death from mass violence in perspective']&lt;/ref&gt; but could also be on the high side, considering that the 100 deadliest acts of mass violence between 480 BCE and 2002 CE (wars and other man-made disasters with at least 300,000 and up to 66 million victims) claimed about 455 million human lives in total.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew White, ''Atrocitology: Humanity's 100 Deadliest Achievements'', Canongate Books Ltd. (20 October 2011), {{ISBN|0857861220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primitive warfare is estimated to have accounted for 15.1 % of deaths and claimed 400 million victims.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew White, [http://necrometrics.com/pre1700b.htm#Primitive 'Primitive War']&lt;/ref&gt; Added to the aforementioned (and perhaps too high) figure of 1,240 million between 3500 BC and the late 20th century, this would mean a total of 1,640,000,000 people killed by war (including deaths from famine and disease caused by war) throughout the history and pre-history of mankind. For comparison, an estimated 1,680,000,000 people died from infectious diseases in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;David McCandless, [http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/20th-century-death '20th Century Death']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nuclear warfare]] breaking out in August 1988, when nuclear arsenals were at peak level, and the aftermath thereof, could have reduced human population from 5,150,000,000 by 1,850,000,000 to 3,300,000,000 within a period of about one year, according to a projection that did not consider "the most severe predictions concerning [[nuclear winter]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wm. Robert Johnston, [http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/nuclearwar1.html 'The Effects of a Global Thermonuclear War']&lt;/ref&gt; This would have been a proportional reduction of the world’s population exceeding the reduction caused in the 14th century by the [[Black Death]], and comparable in proportional terms with the plague’s impact on Europe's population in 1346–53.

In ''[[War Before Civilization]]'', Lawrence H. Keeley, a professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], says approximately 90–95% of known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brneurosci.org/reviews/war.html |title=Review: War Before Civilization |publisher=Brneurosci.org |date=4 September 2006 |accessdate=2011-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121021158/http://brneurosci.org/reviews/war.html |archivedate=21 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and many fought constantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/HG04Aa02.html|title=The fraud of primitive authenticity|last=Spengler|date=4 July 2006|work=Asia Times Online|accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeley describes several styles of primitive combat such as small raids, large raids, and massacres. All of these forms of warfare were used by primitive societies, a finding supported by other researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Debra L., Ryan P. Harrod, and Ventura R. Pérez, eds. 2012. ''The Bioarchaeology of Violence''. Gainesville: University Press of Florida. http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=MARTI002&lt;/ref&gt; Keeley explains that early war raids were not well organized, as the participants did not have any formal training. Scarcity of resources meant defensive works were not a cost-effective way to protect the society against enemy raids.&lt;ref name="Keeley page 55"&gt;Keeley, Lawrence H: ''War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage''. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Rubinstein]] wrote "Pre-literate societies, even those organised in a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty...'archaeology yields evidence of prehistoric massacres more severe than any recounted in ethnography [i.e., after the coming of the Europeans].'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W.

[[File:MokoShuraiE-Kotoba IV.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Japanese [[samurai]] attacking a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] ship, 13th century]]
In Western Europe, since the late 18th century, more than 150 conflicts and about 600 battles have taken place.&lt;ref name="War"&gt;[http://www.ralphmag.org/CG/world-war-one2.html World War One – A New Kind of War | Part II], From ''14 – 18 Understanding the Great War'', by Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau, Annette Becker&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, war resulted in a dramatic intensification of the pace of social changes, and was a crucial catalyst for the emergence of the Left as a force to be reckoned with.&lt;ref name = "Kolko 1994 xviitoxviii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kolko|1994|p=xvii–xviii}}: "War in this century became an essential precondition for the emergence of a numerically powerful Left, moving it from the margins to the very center of European politics during 1917–18 and of all world affairs after 1941".&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent rapid increases in the technologies of war, and therefore in its destructiveness (see [[mutual assured destruction]]), have caused widespread public concern, and have in all probability forestalled, and may altogether prevent the outbreak of a nuclear [[World War III]]. At the end of each of the last two World Wars, concerted and popular efforts were made to come to a greater understanding of the underlying dynamics of war and to thereby hopefully reduce or even eliminate it altogether. These efforts materialized in the forms of the [[League of Nations]], and its successor, the United Nations.

In 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of modern warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences and costs of the newly developed [[atom bomb]], [[Albert Einstein]] famously stated, "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."&lt;ref name="EinsteinWWIV"&gt;{{cite web|year=1947 |url=http://www.wagingpeace.org/menu/action/urgent-actions/einstein/ |title=Albert Einstein: Man of Imagination |accessdate=2010-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604080636/http://www.wagingpeace.org/menu/action/urgent-actions/einstein/ |archivedate=4 June 2010 }} Nuclear Age Peace Foundation paper

[[Mao Zedong]] urged the socialist camp not to fear nuclear war with the United States since, even if "half of mankind died, the other half would remain while imperialism would be razed to the ground and the whole world would become socialist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Instant Wisdom: Beyond the Little Red Book |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946612-2,00.html |date= 20 September 1976 |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate= 14 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Human Security Report 2005]] documented a significant decline in the number and severity of armed conflicts since the end of the [[Cold War]] in the early 1990s. However, the evidence examined in the 2008 edition of the Center for International Development and Conflict Management's "Peace and Conflict" study indicated the overall decline in conflicts had stalled.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Joseph, J.

Human history had numerous wars coming and going, but the average number of people dying from war has fluctuated relatively little, being about 1 to 10 people dying per 100,000. However, major wars over shorter periods have resulted in much higher casualty rates, with 100-200 casualties per 100,000 over a few years. While conventional wisdom holds that casualties have increased in recent times due to technological improvements in warfare, this is not generally true. For instance, the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648) had about the same number of casualties per capita as [[World War I]], although it was higher during [[World War II]] (WWII). That said, overall the number of casualties from war has not significantly increased in recent times. Quite to the contrary, on a global scale the time since WWII has been unusually peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ourworldindata.org/war-and-peace/|title=War and Peace|work=Our World in Data|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Largest by death toll===
{{Main|List of wars by death toll|Outline of war#Wars}}
The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is [[World War II]], from 1939 to 1945, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the [[Mongol conquests]]&lt;ref&gt;*The Cambridge History of China: Alien regimes and border states, 907–1368, 1994, p. 622, cited by White
&lt;br /&gt;*Matthew White (2011-11-07). The Great Big Book of Horrible Things: The Definitive Chronicle of History's 100 Worst Atrocities.&lt;/ref&gt; at up to 60 million. As concerns a belligerent's losses in proportion to its prewar population, the most destructive war in [[modern history]] may have been the [[Paraguayan War]] (see [[Paraguayan War casualties]]). In 2013 war resulted in 31,000 deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990.&lt;ref name=GDB2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|pmc=4340604|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Richard Smalley]] identified war as the sixth biggest problem (out of ten) facing humanity for the next fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;"Top Ten Problems of Humanity for Next 50 Years", Professor R. E. Smalley, Energy &amp; NanoTechnology Conference, Rice University, May 3, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; War usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease in social spending, [[famine]], large-scale emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] or civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tanton|first1=John|title=The Social Contract|date=2002|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=John|title=The pursuit of happiness|date=1992|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baxter|first1=Richard|title=Humanizing the Laws of War|date=2013|page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, of the nine million people who were on the territory of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]] in 1941, some 1.6 million were killed by the Germans in actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 Jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians).&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin'', Basic Books, 2010, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; Another byproduct of some wars is the prevalence of [[propaganda]] by some or all parties in the conflict,&lt;ref&gt;''Dying and Death: Inter-disciplinary Perspectives''.  p. 153, Asa Kasher (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and increased revenues by [[weapons manufacturers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chew|first1=Emry|title=Arming the Periphery|date=2012|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been waged in the last century. These are the two World Wars, followed by the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (which is sometimes considered part of [[World War II]], or as overlapping). Most of the others involved China or neighboring peoples. The death toll of World War II, being over 60 million, surpasses all other war-death-tolls.&lt;ref name="users.erols"&gt;McFarlane, Alan: ''The Savage Wars of Peace: England, Japan and the Malthusian Trap'', Blackwell 2003, {{ISBN|0-631-18117-2}},

===On military personnel===
[[Military personnel]] subject to combat in war often suffer mental and physical injuries, including depression, [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], disease, injury, and death.

{{Quote|In every war in which American soldiers have fought in, the chances of becoming a psychiatric casualty – of being debilitated for some period of time as a consequence of the stresses of military life – were greater than the chances of being killed by enemy fire.|''No More Heroes'', Richard Gabriel&lt;ref name="War"/&gt;}}

During World War II, research conducted by [[US Army]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[S.L.A. Marshall]] found, on average, 15% to 20% of American riflemen in WWII combat fired at the enemy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lt. Col. Dave Grossman|title=On Killing – The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War &amp; Society|publisher= Little, Brown &amp; Co., |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Civil War Collector’s Encyclopedia, F.A. Lord notes that of the 27,574 discarded muskets found on the Gettysburg battlefield, nearly 90% were loaded, with 12,000 loaded more than once and 6,000 loaded 3 to 10 times. These studies suggest most military personnel resist firing their weapons in combat, that – as some theorists argue – human beings have an inherent resistance to killing their fellow human beings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt; Swank and Marchand’s WWII study found that after sixty days of continuous combat, 98% of all surviving military personnel will become psychiatric casualties. Psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety, obsessional and compulsive states, and character disorders.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt;

[[United States military casualties of war]] since 1775 have totaled over two million.

Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; Civilians in war zones may also be subject to war atrocities such as [[genocide]], while survivors may suffer the psychological aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war.

Most estimates of [[World War II casualties]] indicate around 60 million people died, 40 million of which were civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World War II Fatalities|url=http://www.secondworldwar.co.uk/casualty.html|accessdate=2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deaths in the [[Soviet Union]] were around [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|27 million]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4530565.stm|title=Leaders mourn Soviet wartime dead | date=9 May 2005 | accessdate=6 January 2010|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a high proportion of those killed were young men who had not yet fathered any children, population growth in the postwar Soviet Union was much lower than it otherwise would have been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Geoffrey A. |last=Hosking|title=Rulers And Victims: The Russians in the Soviet Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDMVMqDvp4QC&amp;pg=PA242|accessdate=31 May 2012|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02178-5|pages=242–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the economy===
{{see also|Military Keynesianism}}

Once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay [[war reparations]] to the victorious nations. In certain cases, land is ceded to the victorious nations. For example, the territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] has been traded between France and Germany on three different occasions.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Typically, war becomes intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons. Some economists{{who|date=July 2016}} believe war can stimulate a country's economy (high government spending for World War II is often credited with bringing the U.S. out of the [[Great Depression]] by most [[Keynesian]] economists) but in many cases, such as the wars of Louis XIV, the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and [[World War I]], warfare primarily results in damage to the economy of the countries involved. For example, Russia's involvement in World War I took such a toll on the Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gatrell|first1=Peter|title=Russia's First World War : A Social and Economic History|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=9781317881391|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the arts===
War leads to [[forced migration]] causing potentially large displacements of population. Among forced migrants there are usually relatively large shares of artists and other types of creative people, causing so the war effects to be particularly harmful for the country’s creative potential in the long-run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jan Borowiecki | first1 = Karol | year = 2012 | title = Are composers different?

In war, cultural institutions, such as libraries, can become "targets in themselves; their elimination was a way to denigrate and demoralize the enemy population." The impact such destruction can have on a society is important because "in an era in which competing ideologies fuel internal and international conflict, the destruction of libraries and other items of cultural significance is neither random nor irrelevant. Preserving the world’s repositories of knowledge is crucial to ensuring that the darkest moments of history do not endlessly repeat themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, K. (2007).

==Aims==

Entities deliberately contemplating going to war and entities considering whether to end a war may formulate ''war aims'' as an evaluation/propaganda tool. War aims may stand as a proxy for national-military resolve.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Classification ===

Tangible/intangible aims:
* Tangible war aims may involve (for example) the acquisition of territory (as in the German goal of [[Lebensraum]] in the first half of the 20th century) or the recognition of economic concessions (as in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]]).
* Intangible war aims – like the accumulation of credibility or reputation&lt;ref&gt;
Welch distinguishes: "tangible goods such as arms, wealth, and – provided they are strategically or economically valuable – territory and resources" from "intangible goods such as credibility and reputation" – {{cite book

==Limiting and stopping==
[[File:Washington March15 2003-02.jpg|thumb|Anti-war rally in Washington, D.C., March 15, 2003]]
{{main|Anti-war movement}}
{{See also|Aestheticization of violence}}

Religious groups have long formally opposed or sought to limit war as in the [[Second Vatican Council]] document ''Gaudiem et Spes'': "Any act of war aimed indiscriminately at the destruction of entire cities of extensive areas along with their population is a crime against God and man himself. It merits unequivocal and unhesitating condemnation."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html PASTORAL CONSTITUTION ON THE CHURCH IN THE MODERN WORLD GAUDIUM ET SPES PROMULGATED BY HIS HOLINESS, POPE PAUL VI ON DECEMBER 7, 1965]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century, including, most prominently, [[World War I]], [[World War II]], and the [[Vietnam War]]. In the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred in response to the United States [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|invasion of Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. Protests [[Opposition to the War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|opposing the War in Afghanistan]] occurred in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Organizations like [[Stop the War Coalition]], based in the United Kingdom, worked on campaigning against the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stop the War Coalition: Timeline of Events 2001–2011 |url=http://stopwar.org.uk/index.php/about/timeline-of-stop-the-war-events-2001-2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530053507/http://www.stopwar.org.uk/index.php/about/timeline-of-stop-the-war-events-2001-2011 |archivedate=30 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It won the recognition of President Calderon, who began war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Calderon apologizes to drug war victims |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2011/06/20116244495608277.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of motivation==
[[File:Szigetvar 1566.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[List of campaigns of Suleiman the Magnificent|Ottoman campaign]] for territorial [[Ottoman wars in Europe|expansion in Europe]] in 1566]]
There are many theories about the motivations for war, but no consensus about which are most common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levy |first=Jack S. |year=1989 |title=The Causes of War: A Review of Theories and Evidence |journal=Behavior, Society and Nuclear War |volume=I |page=295 |editor1-first=Philip E. |editor1-last=Tetlock |editor2-first=Jo L. |editor2-last=Husbands |editor3-first=Robert |editor3-last=Jervis |editor4-first=Paul C. |editor4-last=Stern |editor5-first=Charles |editor5-last=Tilly |accessdate=4 May 2012 |url=http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/levy/1989%20Causes%20of%20War.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922150721/http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/levy/1989%20Causes%20of%20War.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl von Clausewitz]] said, 'Every age has its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and its own peculiar preconceptions.'&lt;ref&gt;Clausewitz, Carl Von (1976), ''On War'' (Princeton University Press) p. 593&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychoanalytic===
Dutch psychoanalyst [[Joost Meerloo]] held that, "War is often...a mass discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of mankind are discharged in mass destruction."&lt;ref name = "meerloo"&gt;
| A. M. Meerloo, M.D. ''The Rape of the Mind'' (2009) p. 134, Progressive Press, {{ISBN|978-1-61577-376-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Thus war can sometimes be a means by which man's own frustration at his inability to master his own self is expressed and temporarily relieved via his unleashing of destructive behavior upon ''others.'' In this destructive scenario, these ''others'' are made to serve as the scapegoat of unspoken and subconscious frustrations and fears.

Other psychoanalysts such as E.F.M. Durban and [[John Bowlby]] have argued human beings are [[Inheritance|inherently]] violent.&lt;ref&gt;Durbin, E.F.L. and John Bowlby. ''Personal Aggressiveness and War'' 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; This aggressiveness is fueled by [[displacement (psychology)|displacement]] and [[Psychological projection|projection]] where a person transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other [[race (human classification)|races]], religions, nations or [[Ideology|ideologies]]. By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare.

The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of [[Melanie Klein]], thought war was the paranoid or projective “elaboration” of mourning.&lt;ref&gt;(Fornari 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Fornari thought war and violence develop out of our “love need”: our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation.

Despite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, few wars have originated from a desire for war among the general populace.&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, T.C.W. "The Origin of Great Wars." ''The Origins of the French Revolutionary Wars.'' p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Maurice N. ''War and the Human Race.'' 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues the general populace is more neutral towards war and wars occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power. War is caused by leaders who seek war such as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war.

{{Quotation|Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. ... the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.|

Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging in or after the Mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater population density and [[competition]] over resources; the other sees human warfare as a more ancient practice derived from common animal tendencies, such as territoriality and sexual competition.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Meyer. Social Evolution in Franz M. Wuketits and Christoph Antweiler (eds.) Handbook of Evolution The Evolution of Human Societies and Cultures Wiley-VCH Verlag&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found in many primate species such as [[chimpanzee]]s,&lt;ref name = "ApesWar"&gt;{{cite news

Some proponents of the idea argue that war, while innate, has been intensified greatly by developments of technology and social organization such as weaponry and states.&lt;ref&gt;Johan M.G. van der Dennen. 1995. ''The Origin of War: Evolution of a Male-Coalitional Reproductive Strategy''. Origin Press, Groningen, 1995 chapters 1 &amp; 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist and linguist [[Steven Pinker]] argued that war-related behaviors may have been naturally selected in the ancestral environment due to the benefits of victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Pinker |url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/index.html |title=Steven Pinker – Books – The Blank Slate |publisher=Pinker.wjh.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510091413/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/index.html |archivedate=2011-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2016}}  He also argued that in order to have credible [[deterrence theory|deterrence]] against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for [[revenge]] as well as for protecting a group's (or an individual's) reputation ("[[honor]]").{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Crofoot and Wrangham have argued that warfare, if defined as group interactions in which "coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other groups", is a characteristic of most human societies. Those in which it has been lacking "tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their neighbors".&lt;ref name="HumanPrimateAggression"&gt;''Mind the Gap: Tracing the Origins of Human Universals'' By Peter M. Kappeler, Joan B. Silk, 2009, Chapter 8, "Intergroup Aggression in Primates and Humans; The Case for a Unified Theory", Margaret C. Crofoot and Richard W. Wrangham&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ashley Montagu]] strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare. Thus, he argues, warfare is not a universal human occurrence and appears to have been a historical invention, associated with certain types of human societies.&lt;ref&gt;Montagu, Ashley (1976), ''The Nature of Human Aggression'' (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; Montagu's argument is supported by ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent, e.g. the [[Chewong]] and [[Semai people|Semai]] of the Malay peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Signe and Roy Willis, eds. (1989) ''Societies at Peace: Anthropological Perspectives''. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Bobbi S. Low has observed correlation between warfare and education, noting societies where warfare is commonplace encourage their children to be more aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sitemaker.umich.edu/eugene.burnstein/files/35._low_93_evolutionaryperspective_war.pdf "An Evolutionary Perspective on War"], Bobbi S.

===Economic===
[[File:Disabled Iraqi T-54A, T-55, Type 59 or Type 69 tank and burning Kuwaiti oil field.jpg|thumb|Kuwaiti [[oil well]]s on fire, during the [[Gulf War]], 1 March 1991]]
War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for [[natural resource]]s and for wealth. War has also been linked to [[economic development]] by economic historians and development economists studying [[state-building]] and [[fiscal capacity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Noel D.|last2=Koyama|first2=Mark|date=2015|title=States and Economic Growth: Capacity and Constraints|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/md0bpim4r69d5eq/State%20Capacity%20Survey%2010-5-15%20Draft.pdf?dl=0|journal=George Mason University WORKING PAPER|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this theory has been applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars. There are those on the extreme [[right (politics)|right]] of the political spectrum who provide support, fascists in particular, by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Griffin]] and Matthew Feldman, eds., ''Fascism: Fascism and Culture'', New York: [[Routledge]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, Mike. ''[[Social Darwinism]] in European and American Thought, 1860–1945: Nature as Model and Nature as Threat'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Some centrist, capitalist, world leaders, including [[Presidents of the United States]] and U.S. [[General officer|Generals]], expressed support for an economic view of war.

===Marxist===
The [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great ([[Imperialism|imperialist]]) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of the [[free market]] and [[Social class|class system]]. Part of the theory is that war will disappear once a [[world revolution]], over-throwing free markets and class systems, has occurred. Marxist philosopher [[Rosa Luxemburg]] theorized that [[imperialism]] was the result of capitalist countries needing new [[Market (economics)|markets]]. Expansion of the [[means of production]] is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in [[consumer demand]]. Since the workers in a [[capitalist economy]] would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/1955/08/imp-crit.html |title=The Marxist Theory of Imperialism and its Critics |first=Einde |last=O'Callaghan |publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]] |date=25 October 2007 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographic===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[The Clash of Civilizations|Clash of Civilizations]] --&gt;

Demographic theories can be grouped into two classes, Malthusian and youth bulge theories:

====Malthusian====
[[File:Aerial view of a US helicopter as it flies over a Mogadishu residential area.JPEG|thumb|right|U.S. Marine helicopter on patrol in Somalia as part of the [[Unified Task Force]], 1992]]
[[Malthusian catastrophe|Malthusian theories]] see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict.

[[Pope Urban II]] in 1095, on the eve of the [[First Crusade]], spoke:
{{quote|For this land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea and the mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population; it scarcely furnishes food enough for its cultivators. Hence it is that you murder and devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many among you perish in civil strife. Let hatred, therefore, depart from among you; let your quarrels end. Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepulchre; wrest that land from a wicked race, and subject it to yourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lend me your ears: great speeches in history |first=William |last=Safire |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-393-05931-1 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding populations and limited resources. [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766–1834) wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or [[famine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geography: an integrated approach |first=David |last=Waugh |publisher=[[Nelson Thornes]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-17-444706-1 |page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Youth bulge====
[[File:2017 world map, median age by country.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Population pyramid|Median age]] by country. War reduces life expectancy. A youth bulge is evident for [[Demographics of Africa|Africa]], and to a lesser extent in some countries in West Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Central America.]]

According to Heinsohn, who proposed [[youth bulge]] theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the "fighting age" cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age. It will follow periods with [[total fertility rate]]s as high as 4–8 children per woman with a 15–29-year delay.&lt;ref&gt;Helgerson, John L. (2002): "The National Security Implications of Global Demographic Trends"[http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cia/helgerson2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinsohn, G. (2006): "Demography and War" [https://de.scribd.com/doc/310263543/Gunnar-Heinsohn-Demography-and-War (online)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heinsohn saw both past "Christianist" European colonialism and imperialism, as well as today's Islamist civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges.&lt;ref&gt;Heinsohn, G. (2005): "Population, Conquest and Terror in the 21st Century" [https://de.scribd.com/doc/310265022/Gunnar-Heinsohn-Population-Conquest-and-Terror-in-the-21st-Century (online)]&lt;/ref&gt; Among prominent historical events that have been attributed to youth bulges are the role played by the historically large youth cohorts in the rebellion and revolution waves of early modern Europe, including the [[French Revolution]] of 1789,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack A. Goldstone|title=Revolution and Rebellion in the Early Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M-T9dR7nWDUC|accessdate=31 May 2012|date=4 March 1993|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08267-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the effect of economic depression upon the largest German youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Moller, Herbert (1968): ‘Youth as a Force in the Modern World’, ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 10: 238–60; 240–44&lt;/ref&gt; The 1994 [[Rwandan Genocide]] has also been analyzed as following a massive youth bulge.&lt;ref&gt;Diessenbacher, Hartmut (1994): ''Kriege der Zukunft: Die Bevölkerungsexplosion gefährdet den Frieden''.

===Rationalist===
[[File:LRPs directing artillery.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. soldiers directing artillery on enemy trucks in A Shau Valley, April 1968]]
[[Rationalism (international relations)|Rationalism]] is an [[international relations theory]] or framework. Rationalism (and [[Neorealism (international relations)]]) operate under the assumption that states or international actors are rational, seek the best possible outcomes for themselves, and desire to avoid the costs of war.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Rationalist Explanations for War|last = Fearon|first = James D.|date = Summer 1995|journal = International Organization |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=379–414|doi = 10.1017/s0020818300033324|pmid = |jstor=2706903}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under a [[game theory]] approach, rationalist theories posit all actors can bargain, would be better off if war did not occur, and likewise seek to understand why war nonetheless reoccurs. In "Rationalist Explanations for War", [[James Fearon]] examined three rationalist explanations for why some countries engage in war:
* Issue indivisibilities
* Incentives to misrepresent or [[information asymmetry]]
* Commitment problems&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

"Issue indivisibility" occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining, because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, but only owned entirely by one side or the other.

[[File:U.S. Marines in Operation Allen Brook (Vietnam War) 001.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. Marines direct a concentration of fire at the enemy, Vietnam, 8 May 1968]]
"[[Information asymmetry]] with incentives to misrepresent" occurs when two countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of state's victory or loss. For instance, [[Geoffrey Blainey]] argues that war is a result of miscalculation of strength. He cites historical examples of war and demonstrates, "war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic crisis which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting estimates of their bargaining power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Blainey|title=Causes of War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mcknp3tt0LMC&amp;pg=PA114|year=1988|edition=3rd|page=114|accessdate=2016-03-19|isbn=9780029035917}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states' inability to make credible commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Powell | first1 = Robert | year = 2002 | title = Bargaining Theory and International Conflict | url = | journal = Annual Review of Political Science | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 1–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the rationalist tradition, some theorists have suggested that individuals engaged in war suffer a normal level of [[cognitive bias]],&lt;ref&gt;Chris Cramer, 'Civil War is Not a Stupid Thing', {{ISBN|978-1850658214}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are still "as rational as you and me".&lt;ref&gt;From point 10 of [http://asiafoundation.org/in-asia/2014/12/10/modern-conflict-is-not-what-you-think/ Modern Conflict is Not What You Think (article)], accessed 16 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to philosopher [[Iain King]], "Most instigators of conflict overrate their chances of success, while most participants underrate their chances of injury...."&lt;ref&gt;Quote from [[Iain King]], in [http://asiafoundation.org/in-asia/2014/12/10/modern-conflict-is-not-what-you-think/ Modern Conflict is Not What You Think]&lt;/ref&gt;  King asserts that "Most catastrophic military decisions are rooted in [[GroupThink]]" which is faulty, but still rational.&lt;ref&gt;Point 6 in [http://asiafoundation.org/in-asia/2014/12/10/modern-conflict-is-not-what-you-think/ Modern Conflict is Not What You Think]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationalist theory focused around bargaining is currently under debate. The Iraq War proved to be an anomaly that undercuts the validity of applying rationalist theory to some wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lake|first1=David A.|title=Two Cheers for Bargaining Theory: Assessing Rationalist Explanations of the Iraq War|journal=International Security|date=November 2010|pages=7–52|doi=10.1162/isec_a_00029|volume=35|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political science===
The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] following [[World War I]]. More recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the [[Correlates of War]] Project, Peter Brecke and the [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The following subsections consider causes of war from system, societal, and individual levels of analysis. This kind of division was first proposed by [[Kenneth Waltz]] in ''[[Man, the State, and War]]'' and has been often used by political scientists since then.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|143}}

====System-level====

There are several different [[international relations theory]] schools. Supporters of [[realism in international relations]] argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security, and conflicts can arise from the inability to distinguish defense from offense, which is called the [[security dilemma]].&lt;ref name=Levy1998&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levy|first1=Jack S.|title=The Causes of War and the Conditions of Peace|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|date=Jun 1998|volume=1|pages=139–65|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.1.1.139|url=http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/levy/1998%20causes%20of%20war%20%26%20conditions%20of%20peace.pdf|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TXiBeznJ?url=http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/levy/1998%20causes%20of%20war%20%26%20conditions%20of%20peace.pdf|archivedate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|145}}

Within the realist school as represented by scholars such as [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Hans Morgenthau]], and the [[neorealism (international relations)|neorealist]] school represented by scholars such as [[Kenneth Waltz]] and [[John Mearsheimer]], two main sub-theories are:
# [[Balance of power (international relations)|Balance of power]] theory: States have the goal of preventing a single state from becoming a hegemon, and war is the result of the would-be hegemon's persistent attempts at power acquisition. In this view, an international system with more equal distribution of power is more stable, and "movements toward unipolarity are destabilizing."&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|147}} However, evidence has shown power [[Polarity (international relations)|polarity]] is not actually a major factor in the occurrence of wars.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|147–48}}
# [[Power transition theory]]: Hegemons impose stabilizing conditions on the world order, but they eventually decline, and war occurs when a declining hegemon is challenged by another rising power or aims to preemptively suppress them.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|148}} On this view, unlike for balance-of-power theory, wars become ''more'' probable when power is more equally distributed. This "power preponderance" hypothesis has empirical support.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|148}}
The two theories are not mutually exclusive and may be used to explain disparate events according to the circumstance.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|148}}

[[Liberalism (international relations)|Liberalism]] as it relates to international relations emphasizes factors such as trade, and its role in disincentivizing conflict which will damage economic relations.  Realists{{who|date=July 2016}} respond that military force may sometimes be at least as effective as trade at achieving economic benefits, especially historically if not as much today.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|149}} Furthermore, trade relations which result in a high level of dependency may escalate tensions and lead to conflict.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|150}} Empirical data on the relationship of trade to peace are mixed, and moreover, some evidence suggests countries at war don't necessarily trade less with each other.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|150}}

====Societal-level====
* [[Diversionary foreign policy|Diversionary theory]], also known as the "scapegoat hypothesis", suggests the politically powerful may use war to as a diversion or to rally domestic popular support.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|152}} This is supported by literature showing out-group hostility [[Realistic conflict theory|enhances]] in-group [[Group cohesiveness|bonding]], and a significant domestic "rally effect" has been demonstrated when conflicts begin.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|152–13}} However, studies examining the increased use of force as a function of need for internal political support are more mixed.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|152–53}} U.S. war-time presidential popularity surveys taken during the presidencies of several recent U.S. leaders have supported diversionary theory.&lt;ref name="MilitaryAdventurism"&gt;{{cite web| year = 2001| url = http://www.bepress.com/peps/vol7/iss3/3/| title = Peace Economics, Peace Science and Public Policy (p. 19)| accessdate = 2010-02-07| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110707224412/http://www.bepress.com/peps/vol7/iss3/3/| archivedate = 7 July 2011| df = dmy-all}} More recently studies (Lebow 2008, Lindemann 2010) demonstrated that striving for self-esteem (i.e. virile self images), and recognition as a Great Power or non-recognition (exclusion and punishment of great powers, denying traumatic historical events) is a principal cause of international conflict and war.
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Individual-level====

These theories suggest differences in people's personalities, decision-making, emotions, belief systems, and biases are important in determining whether conflicts get out of hand.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|157}} For instance, it has been proposed that conflict is modulated by [[bounded rationality]] and various [[cognitive biases]],&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|157}} such as [[prospect theory]].&lt;ref name=Levy1997&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levy|first1=Jack S.|title=Prospect Theory, Rational Choice, and International Relations|journal=International Studies Quarterly|date=Mar 1997|volume=41|issue=1|pages=87–112|url=http://www.ou.edu/uschina/texts/Levy.97.ISQ.ProspectTheory.pdf|doi=10.1111/0020-8833.00034|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924075824/http://www.ou.edu/uschina/texts/Levy.97.ISQ.ProspectTheory.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
[[File:Morgen nach der Schlacht967b.jpg|thumb|''Morning after the [[Battle of Waterloo]]'', by [[John Heaviside Clark]], 1816]]

The [[morality]] of war has been the subject of debate for thousands of years.&lt;ref name="DeForrest"&gt;{{cite web|last=DeForrest |first=Mark Edward |title=Conclusion |url=http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/72/26/ |website=JUST WAR THEORY AND THE RECENT U.S. AIR STRIKES AGAINST IRAQ |publisher=Gonzaga Journal of International Law |accessdate=August 1, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402204812/http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/72/26 |archivedate=2 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two principal aspects of ethics in war, according to the [[just war theory]], are ''[[jus ad bellum]]'' and ''[[Jus in bello]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DeForrest |first=Mark Edward |title=GENERALLY RECOGNIZED PRINCIPLES OF JUST WAR THEORY |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jus ad bellum'' (right to war), dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war: first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful intentions – namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil; fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success; fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought must be proportional to means being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Part II, Question 40|url=http://ethics.sandiego.edu/Books/Texts/Aquinas/JustWar.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020212080058/http://ethics.sandiego.edu/Books/Texts/Aquinas/JustWar.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 12, 2002|website=The Summa Theologica|publisher=Benziger Bros. edition, 1947|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosley|first=Alexander|title=The Jus Ad Bellum Convention|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|website=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Jus in bello]]'' (right in war), is the set of ethical rules when conducting war. The two main principles are proportionality and discrimination. Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered.&lt;ref name="Moseley"&gt;{{cite web|last=Moseley|first=Alexander|title=The Principles Of Jus In Bello|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|website=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not.&lt;ref name="Moseley"/&gt; Failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the just-war-belligerent.&lt;ref name="Codevilla, Seabury 1989 304"&gt;{{cite book|last=Codevilla, Seabury|first=Angelo, Paul|title=War: Ends and Means|year=1989|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-465-09067-9|page=304|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/157488610X/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0465090672&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=0144DHEVCX1XCVMJXAZQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racism holds that violence is good so that a master race can be established, or to purge an inferior race from the earth, or both. Social Darwinism asserts that violence is sometimes necessary to weed the unfit from society so civilization can flourish. These are broad [[archetypes]] for the general position that [[the ends justify the means]]. Lewis Coser, U.S. conflict theorist and sociologist, argued conflict provides a function and a process whereby a succession of new equilibriums are created. Thus, the struggle of opposing forces, rather than being disruptive, may be a means of balancing and maintaining a social structure or society.&lt;ref&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "Sociological and Criminological Theory: Brief of Theorists, Theories, and Terms," ''CFM Research'', Jul. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Women's liberation movement}}
The '''[[women's liberation movement]] in Europe''' was a [[Radical feminism|radical]] [[Feminism|feminist]] movement that started in the late 1960s and continued through the 1970s and in some cases into the early 1980s. Inspired by developments in [[North America]] and triggered by the growing presence of women in the labour market, the movement soon gained momentum in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and the [[Scandinavia]]n countries. In addition to improvements in working conditions and equal pay, liberationists fought for complete autonomy for women's bodies including their right to make their own decisions regarding [[Birth control|contraception]] and [[abortion]], and more independence in [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].

Groups which formed typically rejected [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] structure and operated on the basis of membership consensus, rejecting the idea that leadership conferred any expert status, and instead was simply another experience. They believed [[direct action]]s, which informed the public on the issues women faced, were more productive in changing thoughts than reforming laws. Their aims were to redesign society by changing the perception of women and their roles in society.

Though [[Europe]]an liberationists were more aligned with [[Socialism|socialist]] movements than liberationists in the groups which formed elsewhere, women in the WLM typically viewed class-based struggle as secondary to addressing [[patriarchy]]. Liberationists were resistant to any political system which ignored women entirely or relegated their issues to the sidelines. As groups operated autonomously without centralized organization, there was a fluidity in issues they addressed, but almost all members in the movement felt that unfettered access to education, jobs and [[child care]] were primary issues. Bringing issues to the public, which up to the time had been considered private matters, such as division of household labor, [[lesbian]]ism, objectification of women, and sexual violence, was controversial and met with backlash from the media and public who labeled liberationists as man-haters.

There were robust liberationist movements in almost all [[Western Europe]]an countries, though [[Greece]], [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] were late to form movements, as they emerged from [[dictatorship]] in the era. By the middle of the 1970s or early 1980s, as compromises were made by liberal reformers and governments on major target issues, most liberationist groups had disbanded or gone on to work on single focus issues.

==Austria==
Though [[Austria]] was a conservative society, known as one of the most traditional in [[Western Europe]], and has been characterized as having had no protests during the early 1970s when the [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]] was sweeping throughout the world,{{sfn|Fiddler|1997|p=243}} the characterization belies that women came together and began writing about and analyzing the status of women as second-class citizens from a [[Feminism|feminist]] perspective by the late 1960s.{{sfn|Fiddler|1997|p=247}} One of the first writers to evaluate women's place in society in the period was [[Barbara Frischmuth]] who published ''Die Klosterschule'' (The Convent School) in 1968. The [[Autobiography|autobiographical]] novel examined the patriarchal structure of the convent school and its training of women to be submissive and passive.{{sfn|Fiddler|1997|p=252}} That same year, women participated in the student revolts, but were frustrated that they were confined to roles of serving coffee. The ''Arbeitskreis Emanzipation'' (Emancipation Working Group) formed with men and women in 1969 to discuss how women's equality could be furthered.{{sfn|''Der Standard''|2003}}

In 1971, a group known as the ''Arbeitskreis Emanzipation der Frau'' (Working Group for Women's Emancipation, AKE) was formed by the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] ({{lang-de|Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreichs, SPÖ}}). Their goals were to protest the idealization of mothers and eliminate barriers to contraception and abortion. On [[Mother's Day]], 7 May 1971, 130 activists demonstrated on [[Vienna]]'s Mariahilfer Straße to call attention to women's inequality and lack of autonomy to make their own life choices. Hosting a conference the following year in Vienna, the AKE brought women from the states of [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], and [[Vorarlberg]] to join with Viennese women to strategize on how to create an autonomous women's movement. Their goals were to be free of the influence of political parties, working to mobilize women to fight for their own liberation, including control of their own bodies and economic choices. From this congress, Erica Fischer, Renate Fleißner, Renate Kohlbacher, [[Eva Kreisky]], Mirl Ofner, Bodil Pedersen, Emmy Scholl, and Jane Wegscheider co-founded the ''Aktion Unabhängiger Frauen'' (Independent Women's Action, AUF) group, hosting the first group meeting in 1972 to discuss whether men should be allowed to participate in their group.{{sfn|''Der Standard''|2003}}

In December 1972 the AUF joined with women from the [[Communist Party of Austria]] ({{lang-de|Kommunistische Partei Österreichs, KPÖ}}) and the SPÖ calling for the abolition of section 144 of the criminal code which prohibited abortion.{{sfn|Zach|1989}} Gertrud Edlinger, Rosemarie Fischer, Irmtraud Goessler and Kreisky formed a committee ''Aktionskomitee zur Abschaffung des § 144'' (Action committee for the abolition of section 144) to plan the protest to force a referendum. Using street theater, Erika Mis dressed as a convict with ''§ 144'' emblazoned on her apparel. Other actors posed as a doctor, judge and priest, and at the end of the presentation, Mis chopped the prison cage with an axe.{{sfn|''Der Standard''|2004}} A key characteristic of the AUF was its lack of organizational structure, opposition to hierarchy, and opposition to patriarchy within a classless society. Their aims were not focused on reforming laws, but in changing the way that women were perceived and allowed to participate in society. The movement grew rapidly in the early 1970s, but by the middle of the decade had developed many critics. Among them were the [[Socialist feminism|Socialist feminists]], who believed that women's issues would be resolved if class inequality was eliminated and liberal reformers, who felt that by adding women's concerns to existing structures and organizations change would come about. By 1976, AUF dissolved and was reorganized as a women's center with a loose umbrella organizational structure to facilitate groups working on various focal issues regarding women.{{sfn|''Der Funke''|2003}}

==Belgium==
[[File:Hongerstaking_in_Gent_(Belgie)_i.v.m._arrestatie_dr._Pee_die_abortussen_heeft_gepleegd,_vier_vrouwelijk_hongerstakers_met_protestborden_(3327432619).jpg|thumb|[[Hunger strike]] in [[Ghent]] in support of abortion rights, January 1973.]]
Inspired by the student demonstrations in [[France]] and the Women's Lib movement in the [[United States]], renewed interest in feminism emerged in [[Belgium]] in the late 1960s. Supported by [[Chantal de Smet]] and [[Rose Proesmans]], the [[Flemish]] extension of the Dutch [[Dolle Mina]] (Mad Minas) was effective in influencing public opinion by taking a humorous approach to the cause. In French-speaking [[Wallonia]], a more socially oriented, worker-based movement known as Marie Mineur was founded by [[Jeanne Vercheval]].{{sfn|Jacques|2013}} In [[Brussels]], at the [[Université libre de Bruxelles]], a group known as ''Le Front de Libération des Femmes'' gained fame by invading the [[Miss Belgium]] event in May 1971, shouting, "Stop the beauty contest, we are not cattle!"{{sfn|Degavre|Stoffel|2005}}

That same year, the journal ''Et ta sœur?'' (And your sister?) began publication. The following year, the journal, ''Le Petit livre rouge des femmes'' (The Little Red Book of Women){{sfn|Degavre|Stoffel|2005}} was published as an initiative of {{ill|Marie Denis|fr}}. She brought together a wide range of women from various schools of thought on feminism, including liberals, radicals, and [[Socialism|socialists]], as well as workers and intellectuals to compile their thoughts on their lives. The book became very influential, selling 15,000 copies in a few months.{{sfn|Denis|van Rokeghem|1992|pp=76–77}} ''De Nieuwe Maand'' (The New Month) was another influential journal published in the period, which attempted to bridge the traditional divides between socialists and [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] in [[Flanders]].{{sfn|Woodward|Mulier|1999|pp=270–271}}

One of the work groups of ''De Nieuwe Maand'' focused on women's issues and in 1971, they hosted a regional symposium in [[Woumen]] to discuss the similarities women had regardless of their political and religious beliefs and the lack of response on issues effecting women from official organizations and government. This would become the autonomous group ''Vrouwen Overleg Komitee'' (Women's Consultation Committee, VOK), which was predominantly a Flemish organization.{{sfn|Woodward|Mulier|1999|pp=270–271}} On 11 November 1972, [[Simone de Beauvoir]], who had been invited to come to Belgium at the protest held in [[Paris]] on [[International Women's Day]] that year, came to Brussels to speak at a workshop, which they called ''Women's Day'', organized by women from the [[Brussels|Brussels-Capital Region]], Flanders, and [[Wallonia]].{{sfn|Woodward|Mulier|1999|pp=272–273}} Based upon the success of that meeting, organizers of the VOK prepared a second ''Women's Day'' workshop in [[Antwerp]] and soon were hosting meetings throughout the country in various cities.{{sfn|Woodward|Mulier|1999|p=273}}

Out of these various meetings, the focus of the VOK was defined to encourage structural transformation of society, centered on issues such as employment and education. In an effort not to alienate their Catholic members, the organization struggled with its approach to [[abortion]], as they required input and consensus from all women to launch policy directives.{{sfn|Woodward|Mulier|1999|p=274}} For the Dolle Minas and the Marie Mineurs, the main issues were initially free contraception and free abortion. The law forbidding access to contraceptives was withdrawn in 1972.{{sfn|Jacques|2013}} In 1974, women of the VOK, preparing for celebrations of the [[United Nations]]' [[International Women's Year]] adopted the slogan the "Year of the Unemployed Woman" and focused their efforts on bringing awareness that changes needed were not for a year, but for women's lifetimes.{{sfn|Woodward|Mulier|1999|p=274}} The VOK finally adopted a policy of pro-choice on reproductive rights and while it lost some of its conservative members over the decision, there were affiliated group like the Catholic ''Vrouw and Maatschappij'' (Women and Society) which continued to work with the VOK.{{sfn|Woodward|Mulier|1999|p=275}}

In 1975, members of the VOK rallied at the [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Belgian Parliament's Palace of the Nation]] protesting the lack of women elected to office. They organized a campaign along with other women's groups to encourage women to vote and to vote for women candidates. By the end of the 1970s, tensions in the various women' groups operating in Belgium grew, as liberals wanted to focus on changing laws and analyzing women's position based on expert opinion. Liberationists, such as the members of the VOK, opposed moving away from the grass-roots nature of women's work and allowing all members to have a voice.{{sfn|Woodward|Mulier|1999|p=275}} By 1985, the cooperation and work of liberationists for women's autonomy, had given way to more formally-established, politically organized women's groups. The VOK though reduced in numbers was able to survive the change and by the 1990s, turned toward preventing the sexual abuse of women and the quality of women's lives.{{sfn|Woodward|Mulier|1999|p=276}} In 1990 liberals triumphed with partial decriminalization of abortion, and liberationists moved away from the issue.{{sfn|Jacques|2013}} Members of the VOK joined the [[Women in Black]] movement to protest [[Yugoslavia]]n war crimes.{{sfn|Woodward|Mulier|1999|p=277}}

==France==
As early as 1967, women began organizing in [[France]] through various political parties and one group, founded by [[Anne Zelensky]] and [[Jacqueline Feldman]], who had been part of the Women's Democratic Movement, was the ''Féminin, Masculin, Avenir'' (Feminine Masculine Future, FMA), which allowed participation of both female and male activists.{{sfn|Feldman|2009|pp=194–196}} Interest in better conditions for women in France progressed in 1968, inspired by the [[May 1968 events in France|civil unrest in May of that year]].{{sfn|Picq|2008}}{{sfn|Block|2009}} During the occupation of the [[Sorbonne]], Feldman and Zelensky participated in events with the FMA, and realized that preference was given to male activists to speak and the women were shut out.{{sfn|Feldman|2009|p=198}}

[[Antoinette Fouque]], [[Monique Wittig]] and several others organized meetings of women activists from October 1968. The press referred to their activities as MLF or [[Mouvement de libération des femmes]], the French equivalent of the American [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]]. By 1970, the movement began to thrive with demonstrations, including the presentation in August of a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in [[Paris]] to recognize his "even more unknown" wife.{{sfn|Picq|2008}}{{sfn|Block|2009}} Typically women who joined the MLF were leftist-leaning politically, had little trust in centralized-hierarchical organization, supported provocation of authority, and believed in revolutionary change for society.{{sfn|Chaperon|1995|p=72}} That same year in April, the FMA became the ''Féminisme, Marxisme, Action'' (Feminist Marxist Action) and its male members left, leaving a unisex, all-woman's group.{{sfn|Delphy|1991|p=139}} Another liberationist group hosted a demonstration at the [[Paris 8 University|Université de Vincennes]] in May, calling for an end to sexism.{{sfn|Delphy|1991|p=138}} The MLF began publishing leaflets by anonymous authors styling themselves as "any woman" or "some activists", to emphasize their belief that no one woman could be the spokesperson for all women.{{sfn|Picq|2008}} Articles like "Combat pour la libération de la femme" (Combat for the liberation of women) published in ''L'Idiot International'' and "Libération des femmes, année 0" (Liberation of Women, year zero) in the magazine ''Partisans'' in 1970 became widely read.{{sfn|Delphy|1991|p=138}} By September 1970, more than one hundred liberationist groups were meeting regularly around Paris.{{sfn|Delphy|1991|p=143}}

Activists aligned with the movement began to meet every two weeks at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] and by December 1970, had begun publishing the newspaper ''{{ill|Le torchon brûle|fr}}'' (Waging the Battle).{{sfn|Picq|2008}} Each issue, though the ''[[de facto]]'' editor was {{ill|Marie Dedieu|fr}}, was produced by a different liberationist group as a means of validating a broad spectrum of ideas.{{sfn|Mulard|2011}}{{sfn|Fragments d’Histoire de la gauche radicale|2014}} In April 1971, at one of the meetings at the Beaux-Arts, under the guidance of [[Simone de Beauvoir]], the [[Manifesto of the 343]] calling for free access to contraception and abortion was signed by 343 prominent women, which would become one of the main rallying points of the movement.{{sfn|Picq|2008}}{{sfn|Sinard|2017}} In 1979, after a demonstration preceding the passage of the [[Abortion in France|Veil Law]],{{sfn|Picq|2008}} named after [[Simone Veil]] the parliamentarian who pushed through abortion reform,{{sfn|Chan|2017}} Antoinette Fouque, Marie-Claude Grumbach and Sylvina Boissonnas secretly filed paperwork to form an association and trademarked the name "Mouvement de liberation des femmes – MLF" with the Institute of Industrial and Commercial Property.{{sfn|Picq|2008}}{{sfn|Delphy|1991|p=145}} Activists and publishers immediately protested against the misappropriation of their actions which took a movement, belonging to all, and made it the private property of a few with the ability to legally forbid use of the name.{{sfn|Picq|2008}}

During the student protests in 1968, in [[West Germany]], women who were part of the [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund|Socialist German Student Union (SDS)]] in [[West Berlin]] formed the ''{{ill|Aktionsrat zur Befreiung der Frau|de}}'' (Action Council for the Liberation of Women). Their concerns were not only the expectations society placed upon women to confine their role to the family, but also the lack of commitment to women's emancipation by their fellow [[Socialism|socialists]]. Focusing on child care centers, the ''Aktionsrat'' members set up [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] facilities in [[Berlin]] to teach children [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] roles.{{sfn|Harrigan|1982}} Soon thereafter, on 13 September  1968, at the SDS Federal Congress in [[Frankfurt]], [[Helke Sander]] gave a speech articulating the reasons for the founding of ''Aktionsrat'' and the need to politicize the issues of women, which were still considered private matters. Her speech was not taken seriously by the men in attendance and angered at their arrogance, {{ill|Sigrid Rüger|de|Sigrid Damm-Rüger}} threw three [[tomato]]es at the podium, hitting {{ill|Hans-Jürgen Krahl|de}}, one of the leaders of the SDS, in the face. The tomato became a symbol for the women's movement thereafter.{{sfn|Göpfert|2018}}{{sfn|''Die Welt''|2008}} Women in Frankfurt founded the ''Frauen den Weiberrat'' (Women's Council) soon after the congress and excluded men from their meetings.{{sfn|Göpfert|2018}} By November a ''Frauen den Weiberrat'' had been established in [[Hanover]].{{sfn|''Die Welt''|2008}}

Women, as elsewhere in the period, formed collectives which held consciousness-raising sessions and offered advice to other women on issues such as health care,{{sfn|Broeck|2007|p=100}} discussing things like the dangers of [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]], alternative [[Birth control|contraception]] devices and [[abortion]].{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=1971 Bread and Roses}}  One such group was ''Brot und Rosen'' (Bread and Roses) a collective formed in Berlin, founded by Helke Sander, when ''Aktionsrat'' disbanded in 1969.{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=1971 Bread and Roses}} Similar small groups formed in various parts of the country taking small initiatives,{{sfn|''Die Welt''|2008}} though liberationists were more restrained than elsewhere in Europe.{{sfn|Brown|2013|pp=300–301}}{{sfn|Morris|Withers|2018|p=277}} In part, this was because of the movement's apolitical stance, but also in part because [[consciousness-raising]] and the maxim "the personal is political" were the [[antithesis]] to German leftists. For example, the word used to describe feminist consciousness-raising was ''Selbsterfahrung'' (self-experience), which equated to bourgeois, individualistic expression; while the political left used the term ''Aufklärung'' (enightenment), which has a serious, political and intellectual connotation.{{sfn|Harrigan|1982}}

The cause in West Germany was expanded by the German journalist [[Alice Schwarzer]], who became active in France in 1970, where she had been behind the "Manifesto of the 343" calling for free access to abortion. She managed to convince [[Wilfried Maaß]] to have a similar "Manifesto of the 374" published in the ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]''. Appearing on 6 June 1971 under the heading ''[[We've had abortions!|Wir haben abgetrieben!]]'' (We have had abortions) and signed by prominent figures such as the actress [[Romy Schneider]], it was immediately effective, causing pro-abortion pressure groups to be created throughout the country.{{sfn|Brown|2013|pp=300–301}}{{sfn|Morris|Withers|2018|p=277}} The ''Aktion 218'' campaign, a reference to the section of the criminal code which banned abortion, was instigated by students in [[Munich]], [[Cologne]], [[Frankfurt]] and [[West Berlin]].{{sfn|Brown|2013|pp=300–301}}{{sfn|Morris|Withers|2018|p=277}} A public display on the topic of abortion was at a rally held by various groups in November 1971 in [[Düsseldorf]], where it gained mass support.{{sfn|Harrigan|1982}}

Helke Sander and [[Verena Stefan]], among others, living in the collective ''Brot und Rosen'' published ''Frauenhandbuch Nr. 1: Abtreibung und Verhütungsmittel'' (Women's Guide # 1: Abortion and Contraceptives) in 1971.{{sfn|Broeck|2007|p=100}}{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=1971 Bread and Roses}} Within three years, the "yellow" original 30,000 copies had sold out and the second "red" edition was published.{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=1971 Bread and Roses}} Similarly, Stefan's autobiographical novel, ''Häutungen'' (Shedding), published in 1975 quickly sold and was in its 5th edition by 1976. Chronicling Stefan's journey to free herself from the indifference and exploitation of women towards a life shared with women and embracing homosexuality, ''Häutungen'' became a best seller and inspiration to many in the movement.{{sfn|Broeck|2007|p=100}}

In 1971, Homosexual Action West Berlin (HAW) was formed and within a year, eight lesbians had joined the movement opening a women's group within HAW in a commune in [[Schöneberg]]. Among the eight members of the group were [[Ilse Kokula]], Monne Kühn, [[Gisela Necker]], [[Cristina Perincioli]], [[Eva Rieger]], Waltraut Siepert, and [[Christel Wachowski]].{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=Little Band of Perverts (1972)}} Some of these women were instrumental in founding the Berlin Women's Center. Placing an advertisement in the alternative journal ''Hundert Blumen'', in November 1972, Perincioli and Siepert attracted around seventy women who were interested in an apolitical group where women could meet, share publications, counsel and interact with other women. Small subgroups formed and women in each group worked on various topics which were of interest to them. Issues concerned a wide berth of topics including: consciousness-raising, publication, sexuality, and women in prison, among others. There was also a group which demonstrated against the law banning abortion, provided counseling, and arranged medical intervention trips to the Netherlands.{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=Starting the Berlin Women's Center (1972)}} By 1973, there were active groups working in [[Bochum]], [[Bonn]], [[Bremen]], [[Cologne]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Düsseldorf]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Giessen]], [[Munich]], [[Nuremberg]], and [[Tübingen]] on various issues, and networks of support among the various groups and women's centers. A nationwide meeting of liberationist groups took place in Munich in 1973 and in 1974, they met again in Cologne.{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=1973 German Feminist Groups Report}}

In 1974, liberationists organized a women's festival at the [[Technical University of Berlin]].{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=1974 Flying Lesbians, Feminist Festivals}} ''Brot und Rosen'' organized a large event discussing abortion where various women talked about illegal abortionists and filed a complaint against several doctors, though no investigation ever resulted.{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=1971 Bread and Roses}} The Berlin Women's Center organized a public women's party and rejecting male musicians featured women artists like {{ill|Ina Deter|de}} and the [[Flying Lesbians]].{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=1974 Flying Lesbians, Feminist Festivals}} The 1974 murder trial of Judy Andersen and Marion Ihns for the murder of Ihns' abusive husband became a rallying point for women, who held protests inside and outside the courthouse in [[Itzehoe]].{{sfn|Altbach|Clausen|Schultz|Stephan|1984|p=182}}{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=1973-74 Witch Hunt}} Bringing domestic violence to the forefront for the first time in Germany, the trial brought recognition of the magnitude of the problem and led to the establishment of the Berlin women's shelter in 1976 and a rape crisis hotline the following year.{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=Women Against Violence (1974–76)}} By 1982, as had happened on an international scale, there was backlash from both society at large and liberal reformist feminists against the liberationists and they became less visible.{{sfn|Altbach|Clausen|Schultz|Stephan|1984|p=182}}

==Greece==
The first women's group autonomous from a political party in [[Greece]] formed in 1975 as the ''Kinisi gia tin Apeleftherosi ton Gynaikon'' (Movement for the Liberation of Women, KAG), in [[Athens]]. Adopting slogans from the [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]] in the [[United States]] they believed that personal issues could be politicized.{{sfn|''Greek News Agenda''|2017}} Their first public action in 1976 was to protest the lack of access to [[Birth control|contraception]].{{sfn|de Haan|Bucur|Daskalova|2007|p=181}} As the country had just emerged from [[dictatorship]] and a new constitution was being discussed, members of the movement sought to bring attention to the inequalities faced by women in their families and society. They established a newspaper ''Gia tin Apeleftherosi ton Gynaikon'' (For the Liberation of Women) to disseminate their ideas,{{sfn|''Greek News Agenda''|2017}} publishing articles about child care, employment, ideology and sexuality. After four years the group dissolved.{{sfn|Hellenic Parliament Foundation|n.d.}}

==Ireland==
In Dublin, a group called the [[Irish Women's Liberation Movement]] (IWLM) was founded in 1970 when [[Máirín de Burca]], invited a working-class homemaker Máirín  Johnston, journalist Mary Maher, physician Moira Woods, to join her on Monday nights at [[Margaret Gaj]]’s café on Baggot Street in Dublin.{{sfn|Franks|2013|pp=42–43}} Inspired by the WLM in the United States, the non-hierarchical structure of the movement and the shock approach to addressing discrimination appealed to the group.{{sfn|Cosgrove|2008|p=882}} Soon after forming, the group published a pamphlet, ''Chains or Change'', outlining their goals, which included equal education, pay and legal rights; removal of the [[Marriage bar|ban]] against work for married women; fair treatment of deserted wives, unwed mothers and widows; and access to family services such as child care, playgrounds and contraception.{{sfn|Cosgrove|2008|p=882}}{{sfn|Farren|2006}}

The IWLM appeared on the [[The Late Late Show (Irish TV series)|Late Late Show]] in 1971 and conducted protests and activism.{{sfn|Farren|2006}} They led the [[Contraceptive Train]] to bring attention to the hypocrisy of the state's ban on contraception, as officials were unable to enforce it. At the time, the only legal contraceptive was the [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|pill]], but it could not be prescribed except as a medication to regulate menstrual cycles. Protesting women boarded a train in Dublin and traveled to Belfast to purchase condoms. Upon the return trip, they distributed the contraband condoms to the crowd, flouting the official ban.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=46}} After a year, the group dissolved, but was widely influential in that short time-period in changing the societal perception of women.{{sfn|Farren|2006}}

In 1975, the [[Irish Women United]] formed as a liberationist group in Dublin. Their first protest actions were to demonstrate against the male-only [[Forty Foot]] bathing area at [[Dublin Bay]] and the [[Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club]]. They also picketed the [[Miss Ireland]] beauty pageant and competition, and protested during the trial of [[Noreen Winchester]],{{sfn|McCabe|2010}} who had been imprisoned after killing her sexually abusive father.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|1978}} They hosted consciousness-raising sessions and sought removal of legal barriers and bureaucratic obstacles to an egalitarian society including, divorce equal education and pay, free contraception, and self-determined sexuality. To publicize their goals and issues, they created the journal ''Banshee'' and published eight issues before the group dissolved in 1977.{{sfn|McCabe|2010}} Liberationist groups also formed in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and [[Limerick]], establishing women's centres and refuges as well as rape crisis centres.{{sfn|Galligan|1998|p=57}}

==Italy==
[[File:Demonstration_for_abortion_rights_in_Milan,_1975.jpg|alt=Demonstration for abortion rights in Milan, 1975|left|thumb|Demonstration for abortion rights in Milan, 1975]]
In 1967, at the regional congress of the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]] held in [[Bologna]], the issues of sexual and psychological freedom were first brought to discussion as political topics. The following year at the national convention of the party in [[Rome]], the discussion broadened to include [[sexual repression]] and [[Oppression|social oppression]], and a motion was approved to focus on these issues. In 1969, the regional congress in [[Milan]] adopted similar themes, which led to the creation in the winter of 1969–1970 of the group ''Movimento di Liberazione della Donna'' (MLD) ([[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]]). The two planks of the organization were to liberate women by affirming their right to be free and control their own bodies, and to create the necessary health structures to legalize abortion.{{sfn|Radical Party Archive|1972}} From the beginning the organization had political aims, and constructed a plan of action to decriminalize [[abortion]]. By 1975, the organization had split from the Radial Party and become an independent organization fighting for the change to the civil codes dealing with family law.{{sfn|Herstory|n.d.|p=MLD—Movimento di Liberazione della Donna}}

The goals of the [[Italy|Italian]] movement were to make women and their issues a political subject, taking the family out of the private sphere; to create new types of organizations and practices, which allowed women to become political actors; and to redefine the methods of engagement with institutions, political parties and other social organizations.{{sfn|Bracke|2014|p=7}} In 1969 a women's only collective, ''Collectivo delle Compagne'' (Collective of Companions, CDC) formed in [[Turin]], in response to the refusal of male activists to print texts on the liberation movement. Led by Maria Clara Rogozinski and [[Maria-Teresa Fenoglio]], the collective attracted hundreds of members and in 1971 renamed the group, which had become a [[commune]], ''Colletivo di Via Petrarca'', after the street on which it was located. At the meetings of the group, consciousness-raising sessions were held to assist women in removing the boundaries between their personal and public lives and recognizing how private matters could be politicized.{{sfn|Bracke|2014|p=134}}

In Rome, a sexual-health movement, which centered on women's [[reproductive rights]], discovering their own body and sexuality, and creating facilities to offer solutions to women developed.{{sfn|Bracke|2014|p=7}} Known as the ''Comitato romano per la liberalizzazione dell’aborto e della contracezzione ''(Roman committee to liberalize abortion and [[Birth control|contraception]], CRAC) the group rejected any involvement by either medical professionals or the state in women's complete control of their own bodies, though they did support state run medial facilities offering services to women.{{sfn|Bracke|2014|p=85}} In 1970, ''Rivolta femminile'' (Feminist Revolt) was founded in Rome by [[Carla Lonzi]], along with [[Carla Accardi]] and {{ill|Elvira Banotti|it}}, as a rejection of [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theory]], declaring that women were not oppressed as a social class, but rather oppressed because of their gender.{{sfn|Bracke|2014|p=7}}{{sfn|Herstory|n.d.|p=Rivolta Femminile}} In [[Naples]], the collective ''Le Nemesiache'', founded by {{ill|Lina Mangiacapre|it}} in 1970, held reenactments of fables and myths as all-women productions, to assist in consciousness-raising, using the arts as a form of protest.{{sfn|Bracke|2014|p=7}}{{sfn|Pojmann|2017|pp=81–82}} ''Le Nemesiache''′s Manifesto proclaimed that women need not integrate into masculine society or strive for legal equality, but should find their own definitions of what being a woman meant.{{sfn|Pojmann|2017|pp=81–82}} ''Cerchio spezzato'' (Broken Circle) was formed in 1970 by students from the [[University of Trento]], as the first group to advocate separatism. Members saw the [[sexual revolution]] as a means to objectify women and traditional leftist groups as invalidating women's full participation in society.{{sfn|Bracke|2014|p=65}}

In 1972 ''Il Collettivo di via Cherubini 8'' (The Collective at 8 Cherubini Street) formed in Milan, and began publishing the magazine ''Sottosopra'' (Upside Down) to disseminate feminist materials from throughout Italy. An important group in Milan, they hosted several international conferences, meeting with liberationists from [[France]] and [[Denmark]].{{sfn|Melandri|2016}} While they were willing to allow men to participate in protest, the members believed that only women could define their own sexuality.{{sfn|Bracke|2014|p=85}} In 1974 the ''Gruppo Analis i'' (Group Analyst I) and the following year the ''gruppi di Pratica dell'inconscio'' (Practice Groups of the Unconscious) both formed in Milan for the purpose of analyzing the ties between women. Neither were involved in individual analysis, but rather in evaluating the psychology that was shared by women.{{sfn|Melandri|2016}} On 3 April 1976 when some 50,000 women marched through the streets of Rome, calling for abortion on demand. Liberationists failed in their aims, as under the influence of the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]], a compromise solution was reached, giving doctors, rather than women themselves, the necessary decision-making powers, but in practice women were now granted the right to abortion.{{sfn|Bracke|2014|p=86}}{{sfn|Rossi|Degiarde|Verlicchi|1977|p=50}}

The ''Collettivo Femminista di Santa Croce'' (Feminist Collective of Santa Croce) which formed in Florence in 1973, participated in a national conference held in their home city in December 1977, known as ''Donna e follia'' (Woman and Folly). The two aims of the conference were to explore how women could choose to rebel from the strictures of society on a personal level without being considered insane by the rest of society. Many came away from the meeting with mixed feelings, understanding that through the collectives they had gained support from other women who understood their issues, but by having isolated themselves to find their voice, they had in fact marginalized themselves from the greater society.{{sfn|''Effe''|1977}} By the end of the 1970s, the movement became fragmented and activists focus moved toward working on private projects, rather than in the public sphere.{{sfn|Beccalli|1994}}

==Netherlands==
[[File:Dolle Mina beweging te Den Haag tegen voorschriften geboortebeperking RK-kerk, b, Bestanddeelnr 926-5692.jpg|alt=Dolle Mina movement in The Hague in 1973.|thumb|Dolle Mina movement in The Hague in 1973.]]
The WLM movement in the [[Netherlands]], as elsewhere, was born out of the political climate of the late 1960s, which included the anti-Vietnam, the student movement, and the Dutch [[Provo (movement)|Provo Movement]], a provocative movement aimed at undermining ''[[The Establishment]]''. At the time, there was international discussion on [[sexuality]], [[sexual liberation]], [[sexual orientation]], and the relationship of those to marriage, topics that up to that time had not been considered to be political issues. The concept of [[patriarchy]] and a coherent theory about the power relationships between men and women in society did not exist at the time. [[Joke Smit|Joke Kool-Smit]] wrote an article ''Het onbehagen bij de vrouw'' (The Discontent of Women) in 1967 which attempted to put into words the issues for women in Dutch society.{{sfn|Bradshaw|2013|p=391}} In 1968, she formed the [[Man Vrouw Maatschappij]] (Man woman society) as a coalition between men and women to address the inequalities from a liberal position of changing legislation through lobbying.{{sfn|van Oven|2005|p=12}}{{sfn|Doomen|1997}}

In 1969, a group calling themselves the "[[Dolle Mina|Mad Minas]]" ({{lang-nl|Dolle Minas}}) formed with a far more radical position, engaging in public protests to call attention to sexism.{{sfn|van Oven|2005|p=12}}{{sfn|Doomen|1997}} Through consciousness-raising sessions, the Minas met and discussed the issues that they faced in their lives and how those could be politicized. Between January 1970 and October 1974 they staged numerous protests, the first of which was lodged against the [[Nyenrode Business University]], which did not allow women to enroll at that time.{{sfn|van Oven|2005|p=12}} In 1970, they led a protest in [[Amsterdam]] to address anonymous [[groping]]. Sitting on parked cars and bikes, the demonstrators whistled at male bypassers. Entering bars they pinched the [[buttocks]] of male patrons to emphasize their objectification.{{sfn|Foley|1971|p=22}} Other actions in which they participated included protests for day care centers, reproductive rights and women's toilets in public spaces.{{sfn|van Oven|2005|pp=12–13}} After 1972, most of the Minas protests were focused on the issue of legalized abortion and their most successful campaign was called ''Baas in eigen Buik'' (Boss of your Belly), which argued for women's right to govern their own decisions regarding their bodies.{{sfn|van Oven|2005|pp=13–14}}

In 1971, a group known as {{ill|Purple September|nl|Paarse September}} formed along the lines of liberationist lesbians in the United States. Their name derived from [[Betty Friedan]]'s reference to lesbians as the "[[Lavender Menace]]" and they operated as a separatist group, believing that all women were lesbian and should not bed their oppressers.{{sfn|van Oven|2005|p=12}} Rather than reforming the existing society with its [[Hierarchy|hierarchical structure]] giving men priority, they called for the creation of separate societies for women to evaluate their marginal positions in the family and society as well as the politicization of personal issues.{{sfn|Wietsma|2005}} These ideas were characterized by Dutch media much as they were in other places and women who advocated for separatism were seen as being anti-male.{{sfn|Bradshaw|2013|p=395}} After 1974, the liberationist groups in the Netherlands gave way to action groups and liberal feminist groups aimed at legal change, as they believed that thought had significantly changed and political action was necessary.{{sfn|van Oven|2005|pp=13–14}}

==Portugal==
The Women's Liberation Movement came to [[Portugal]] via the "trial of the three Marys"—[[Maria Teresa Horta]], [[Maria Isabel Barreno]] and [[Maria Velho da Costa]].{{sfn|Pena|2008|p=48}} In 1972, Horta, Barreno and Velho da Costa published ''Novas Cartas Portuguesas'' (New Portuguese Letters),{{sfn|Dias Martins|2012|p=24}} a critique of the repression imposed by the Portuguese state since the advent of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|New State]], specifically upon women{{sfn|Dias Martins|2012|p=32-34}} under the arbitrary and patriarchal governing systems.{{sfn|Pena|2008|p=74}} The authors were arrested shortly after the book's printing and charged with violating public [[Morality|moral codes]] and publishing [[censorship]] laws. When the book was banned by censors of the [[Marcelo Caetano|Caetano regime]], the Marys smuggled copies of the book to [[France]]. Sending copies with a cover letter in French to [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Marguerite Duras]], and [[Christiane Rochefort]], they called on international feminists for help.{{sfn|Dias Martins|2012|p=28}} [[Feminism|Feminists]] rallied to their support using the book as a feminist icon for the unity of sistership, hosting demonstrations of support in [[Belgium]], [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]], as well as in major cities in the United States like [[Boston]], [[Houston]], [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D. C.]] and bringing international pressure to bear on the Portuguese regime.{{sfn|Dias Martins|2012|p=26}}{{sfn|Pena|2008|pp=63–64}} Ironically, ''Novas Cartas Portuguesas'' was not translated except in fragments until after the authors' acquittal in 1974.{{sfn|Dias Martins|2012|pp=28–29}} The ban of the book, and subsequently ban on discussing it, or the trial, on the news, meant that within Portugal, it was not read either.{{sfn|Pena|2008|p=61}} Subsequently, it was translated into [[French language|French]] (1974), [[English language|English]] (1975), [[German language|German]] (1976) and [[Italian language|Italian]] (1977).{{sfn|Dias Martins|2012|pp=28–29}}

Two weeks after the [[Carnation Revolution]] ousted Marcelo Caetano from power 25 April 1974, the Marys were acquitted. Velho da Costa immediately distanced herself from the book and the feminist movement making a public declaration that the text had not been a feminist treatise, but was written against [[Fascism|fascist]] repression. Barreno refuted Velho da Costa's stance in a public rebuttal.{{sfn|Dias Martins|2012|p=31}} [[Madalena Barbosa]] and Horta founded the group ''Movimento de Libertação das Mulheres'' (Women's Liberation Movement, MLM) in May 1974, to utilize the momentum created by the trial to improve women's conditions.{{sfn|''Público''|2008}}{{sfn|Pena|2008|pp=73, 83}} Support from other international feminists continued with activists from France, Germany and the Netherlands regularly attending meetings and conferences, providing literature, and providing financial support in Portugal.{{sfn|Pena|2008|p=84}} [[Célia Metrass]] and {{ill|Regina Louro|pt|Maria Regina Louro}} were influential members of the group, but as elsewhere, it was formed without hierarchical leadership and met in small groups, where women explored their personal experiences to evaluate commonalities with other women and politicize them.{{sfn|Pena|2008|pp=87–88}} Influenced by the French feminists, small subgroups formed to discuss issues which were of interest to them, including access to employment, restrictions of motherhood, sexuality, among others.{{sfn|Pena|2008|pp=89, 91}}

On 13 January 1975, the MLM held a demonstration in [[Eduardo VII Park]] to bring attention to the objectification of women. The press reported that they would be burning [[bra]]s and there would be a [[striptease]], fueling curiosity as well as disdain for the activists. They were not allowed to burn the [[veil]], [[mop]] or flowers, carried by three activists dressed as a bride, a [[housewife]] and a sex symbol.{{sfn|Pena|2008|pp=101–103}}{{sfn|Bernardino|2017}} In February of that year, the MLM published the ''Manifesto de Movimento para a Contracepção e Aborto Livre e Gratuito'' (Manifesto of the Movement for Contraception and Free and Abortion, MCALG), demanding free distribution of contraception and educational materials as well as access to abortion and abolition of laws preventing women from controlling their own reproduction. Horta, Célia Metrass and Helena Sá de Medeiros laid out the position of the MLM in their book ''Aborto, Direito ao Nosso Corpo'' (Abortion, Right to Our Body, 1975); abortion was an individual right and not subject to the control by the moral position of the majority.{{sfn|Pena|2008|p=108}}

In April 1975, after a year of meeting in members' homes, the group found a derelict building on Avenida Pedro Álvares Cabral, in [[Lisbon]] and took over the space.{{sfn|Pena|2008|p=93}} One of the critical issues was women's right to control their own bodies, and they demanded not only the right to contraception and abortion, but instituted a campaign for sexual education. Unlike other places, the military, specifically those involved with the [[Movimento das Forças Armadas]], who had implemented the ''[[coup d'état]]'', worked with the MLM on issues of family violence, because [[wartime sexual violence]] was high at the time.{{sfn|Pena|2008|p=94}} The group continued to work on various women's issues through 1979, though never gaining the same visibility as they had with the park protest. Turning their attentions more toward publishing efforts, at the end of the decade, members founded the ''Cooperativa Editorial de Mujeres'' (Women's Editorial Cooperative, 1977) and later the ''Cooperativa Informação, Documentação, Mulher'' (Cooperative Information, Documentation, Women, 1979). They believed that the time for organizing in the street had passed and that the focus should move toward analysis and creating discourse on the issues.{{sfn|Pena|2008|pp=112–114}}

==Scandinavia==
The development of the second wave of women's movements in [[Scandinavia]] continued the interest in improved conditions for women which had begun in [[Denmark]] in 1871 with the [[Danish Women's Society]] (''Dansk Kvindesamfund''). In contrast to the [[United States]] where many organizations were disbanded after the [[Women's suffrage|right to vote]] had been achieved, work in the Scandinavian countries had continued without interruption. Renewed interest in [[gender]] and equality emerged in the 1960s as individuals such as [[Elsa Gress]], [[Åse Gruda Skard]] and [[Alva Myrdal]] promoted debate and commissions on the status of women were formed. In particular the [[Red Stocking Movement (Denmark)|Redstockings]] (''Rødstrømpebevægelsen'') in Denmark and the New Feminists (''Nyfeministene'') in [[Norway]] reflected most of the trends emerging in the United States and elsewhere in Europe.{{sfn|Dahlerup|Gulli|2013|pp=22–23}} As elsewhere, the movement was open to all women. Men were typically discouraged from participation to allow women to develop their agenda on their own terms. Organizations were decentralized and non-[[Hierarchy|hierarchical]], focused on societal change rather than reform for rights, and relied on consciousness-raising to help women politicize their issues.{{sfn|Dahlerup|Gulli|2013|p=26}} Though influenced by leftist politics, liberationists were resistant to any political order which ignored women entirely or relegated their issues to the sidelines.{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=20}}{{#tag:ref|The radical movement in Finland was not a liberationist movement. Beginning in 1965, newspapers published information about gender roles. Born out of the Finnish student movement and the peace movement, ''[[Sadankomitea]]'', women formed [[Association 9]]. The organization, which included both men and women, sought equal status with men in all things that women "were allowed to do".{{sfn|Carrere|Chetaille|Podoleva|2001}} Defining women by societal perceptions of them, the association pushed boundaries by requiring equal obligations, opportunity and rights, through gender role activism.{{sfn|Carrere|Chetaille|Podoleva|2001}}{{sfn|Saarenmaa|2017|p=138}}|group="Notes"}}

===Denmark===
In [[Denmark]], the [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]] had its roots in the 1960s when large numbers of women began to enter the labour market, requiring services such as child care and improved health care. Supported by the Danish Women's Society, the [[Red Stocking Movement (Denmark)|Red Stocking Movement]] was established in 1970. It fought in particular for equal pay for men and women and for better treatment of women in the workplace,{{sfn|Dahlerup|2017}}{{sfn|Larsen|2014}} with one of its first public protests being a sit-in on public buses in [[Copenhagen]] in May 1970. To demonstrate the variance in women's and men's wages, activists insisted that their fare should be 20% less than that charged to men, as that was the pay gap on their wages.{{sfn|Fauré|2004|p=668}} Among many public protests liberationists demonstrated at beauty pageants and walked through the streets, costumed in outlandish, suggestive clothing, to agitate against being treated as [[Sexual objectification|sexual objects]].{{sfn|Carrere|Chetaille|Podoleva|2001}} The following year, Redstockings hosted an all-women summer camp, allowing only male children, if they were under age thirteen. The success of the camp led to experiments in communal living and women's homes, as well as a [[Feminism|feminist]] festival, hosted in 1974.{{sfn|Fauré|2004|p=668}}

The first three to four years of the liberationist movement saw many new issues raised for public debate, including matters previously considered private family concerns like [[abortion]], child care, distribution of domestic chores, [[incest]], and [[sexual violence]], among others. Liberationists were successful in their demands concerning abortion in Denmark, as the law which previously gave limited access, changed in 1973 granting free service on demand with paid sick leave. In 1972, members protested and women campaigned against entry into the European Community, fearing that harmonization of Europe might deteriorate their rights. Danish liberationists preferred to work autonomously and did not integrate with traditional political parties. They focused their demonstrations toward women, society in general and workers and away from governmental lobbying efforts. From the mid-1970s, when state initiatives, such as the Equal Status Council formed in 1975 to address [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] inequality, direct actions by the liberationists ceased.{{sfn|Carrere|Chetaille|Podoleva|2001}}

===Iceland===
The [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]] in [[Iceland]] was inspired by the [[Denmark|Danish]] and Dutch [[Redstockings|Redstocking]] movement and began in 1968, when the first meeting was held.{{sfn|Dahlerup|Gulli|2013|p=27}}{{sfn|Rúdólfsdóttir|1997|p=85}} Launching a journal ''Forvitin rauð'' (Red and curious), the Redstockings explored controversial topics such as abortion, inequality, oppression and the role of women in society. Media portrayed women affiliated with the Redstockings as unkempt and unfeminine man-haters.{{sfn|Rúdólfsdóttir|1997|p=85}} Demonstrations of women wearing red stockings took place on 1 May 1970, as part of the [[Labour Day]] activities. While the majority of women supported socialist class struggle, a small group broke off from the Redstockings joining the more politically neutral Women's Rights Organization (''[[Icelandic Women's Rights Association|Kvénrettindafélag]]'').{{sfn|Dahlerup|Gulli|2013|p=27}}

In 1975, Redstockings proposed a women's strike and participated with other women's groups in organizing a massive demonstration known as ''[[1975 Icelandic women's strike|Women's Day Off]]''. Ninety percent of the women in Iceland struck on 24 October 1975 to demonstrate how vital their participation was in society. Working women refused to work and home makers left child care and domestic chores to their male partners to attended the protest. Men juggled the demands that women typically had to deal with trying to work, while attending to children. Without workers, businesses and schools were forced to close and fathers without day care facilities had to take their children to their work places.{{sfn|Brewer|2015}} The event made worldwide headlines{{sfn|Dahlerup|Gulli|2013|p=27}} and spurred the government to pass a law guaranteeing that men and women had equality the following year.{{sfn|Rennebohm|2009}} As elsewhere, liberationists declined by the end of the decade as their values became mainstream and reforms changed the society.{{sfn|Rúdólfsdóttir|1997|p=87}}

===Norway===
[[Norway|Norwegian]] women began reading literature on the [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]] when ''Myten om kvinnen'', the translation of [[Betty Friedan]]'s ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' was published in 1968 and was widely read.{{sfn|Danielsen|2010|p=38}} When American liberationist [[Jo Freeman]] visited [[Oslo]] in 1970, Norwegian women became interested in new ways to approach addressing women's policy.{{sfn|Nørve|2007}} Inspired by activities in [[Denmark]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]], the New Feminists (''Nyfeministene'') emerged that same year with action groups in [[Oslo]], [[Bergen]] and other large cities,{{sfn|Dahlerup|Gulli|2013|p=28}} as women began to search for an identity outside their homes and sought personal development.{{sfn|Danielsen|2010|p=38}} In the quest to identify for themselves who or what they wanted to be, women in the liberationist movement rejected the notion that equality could be attained in a society in which they were dependent upon men and challenged societal gender roles.{{sfn|Danielsen|2010|p=39}} Uninterested in analysis and reform, they believed that the perception of women could be changed through direct action, which made the public aware of issues such as a woman's control of her own body, the need for day care, the objectification of women, and a working environment which offered equal opportunity, pay and working conditions.{{sfn|Nørve|2007}}

Members of New Feminists were leftist, but mostly apolitical and rejected [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] organizational structures,{{sfn|Lønnå|2003}} this brought them into conflict with groups such as the Women's Front (''Kvinnefronten'') founded in 1972, which called for a specific socialist policy for women, verging on Communism.{{sfn|Dahlerup|Gulli|2013|p=28}}{{sfn|Roseneil, et al.|2010|p=136}} New Feminists believed that the similarities in women's lives because of their bodies, their responsibility for family, and even their sexual experience, bound women into a sisterhood which could not be addressed by traditional class-based activism or structures which had fixed goals. Women's autonomy and gaining their own awareness through consciousness-raising were critical, as liberationists believed that changing oneself and society depended on active evaluation of ones' experiences. Leadership had no special value, as leaders' experiences were not more or less true than other women's experiences. Subgroups quickly spread throughout Norway but monthly joint meetings were held in Oslo.{{sfn|Nørve|2007}}

In 1972, with the release of [[Esther Vilar]]'s book ''[[The Manipulated Man]]'', [[Nina Karin Monsen]] led a group of activists to protest at the publishing house [[Aschehoug]]. Their concern was that since Friedan had been translated, no feminist texts had been released, but Vilar's anti-feminist book was published. The pressure caused the publisher to release a Norwegian translation of the Swedish title ''{{ill|Frihet, jämlikhet och systerskap|sv}}'' (Freedom, Equality and Sisterhood) by {{ill|Maud Hägg|sv}} and {{ill|Barbro Werkmäster|sv}} in 1973. That same year, during demonstrations held on [[International Women's Day]], New Feminists were kicked out of the march in Oslo by members of the Women's Front. Undeterred, the liberationists went to a nearby basement and created banners bearing slogans like ''No for forced labor'', ''No forced births'', ''I am the prime minister'' to spread their message. In January 1973, when members of the New Feminists were refused service at the pub ''Sofus'' on Klingenberggata by managers claiming they were trying to keep prostitutes from their premises, they staged two sit-ins in the establishment. Bringing attention to the unequal treatment by the bar for men and women and showing solidarity with the sex workers, the liberationists forced the bar to close and reopen with a different policy.{{sfn|Nørve|2007}}

New Feminists founded a journal, ''[[Sirene (magazine)|Sirene]]'' in 1973 with the aim of uniting various liberationist groups and disseminating information.{{sfn|Danielsen|2010|p=37}} The journal's attack on [[Housewife|housewives]] was an effort to win women to the cause, as  liberationists used the discontent and unhappiness many women felt with the "housewife/breadwinner system" to fuel the idea that being an unpaid or underpaid laborer led to invisibility and frustration, but the stance caused controversy.{{sfn|Danielsen|2010|pp=39–40}} That same year the liberationists held a national committee meeting in [[Sandnes]] for the 200 autonomous organizations throughout the country. The national committee established its own journal, ''Feministen'' and published the common goals of various groups, but did not serve as an executive board or direct the local groups.{{sfn|Nørve|2007}} 1973 also marked the year, liberationists began to publicly support lesbian liberation, though in 1974, to address their different needs ''Lesbisk bevegelse'' (Lesbian Movement) was founded by former New Feminist members.{{sfn|Lønnå|2003}}

Abortion as part of a woman's right to control her body had been a major part of the New Feminists activism since their founding. In 1975, when the [[Norwegian parliament]] was debating the issue, New Feminists, hiding slogan placards under their coats, asked for a tour, entered the chamber, and protested, demanding unrestricted access to abortion as well as no coercion on the subject. Removal by the police did not prevent further action, such as when the following year liberationists ringed the exterior of the [[Storting building]] singing songs and carrying banners in peaceful protest. Police were again called to break up the protest.{{sfn|Nørve|2007}}{{sfn|Iversen|1978}} In 1975, during the annual women's meeting in Oslo, the group, ''Brød og Roser'' (Bread and Roses) came together from activists who left Women's Front because of its close alignment with the [[Workers' Communist Party (Norway)|Communist Party]] ({{lang-no|Arbeidernes Kommunistparti, AKP}}). They officially formed in March 1976 under the theme that whatever the root cause of women's oppression, they were united in their need for bread (economic liberation) and roses (sisterhood and love). Combining both a class-based and sexist based theory, but acknowledging that some of their members were not socialists, Bread and Roses had subgroups throughout the country.{{sfn|Iversen|1978}}

In 1977 liberationists returned to the [[objectification]] of women and worked with other feminist organizations in the fight against pornography. Creating a traveling exhibition, they protested the consumption of women, which they saw as a catalyst for sexual violence against women.{{sfn|Roseneil, et al.|2010|pp=152–153}} That same year New Feminists in Oslo began the first domestic violence hot line and the following year opened the first emergency women's shelter. Quickly hotlines and shelters became scattered across Norway,{{sfn|Roseneil, et al.|2010|p=154}} as did negative press characterizing activists working against sexual violence as man-haters.{{sfn|Roseneil, et al.|2010|p=156}} Interest in feminism nevertheless spread with the support of other women's organizations in the country leading to activism in the universities and in sports.{{sfn|Lønnå|2003}}

On 8 March 1978, some 20,000 women demonstrated for improved rights.{{sfn|Lønnå|2003}} Ironically, at the height of their influence, radical groups were splintering. The 1978 march was actually two marches, one led by the Women's Front, the Norwegian Women's Association ({{lang-no|Norsk Kvinneforbund}}),  the Oslo Women's Legal Rights Association ({{lang-no|Oslo Kvinnesaksforening}}), and various communist groups, which began at [[Youngstorget]]. The other led by the Oslo Women's Equal Rights Association, gathered at {{ill|Fridjof Nansen's Place|no|Fridtjof Nansens plass (Oslo)}} before starting their march. Members of Bread and Roses, the Lesbian Movement and New Feminists, marched in each protest.{{sfn|Hassenstab|2015|pp=229–230}} In December, 1978, an abortion reform bill was passed which did not meet liberationists demands but rather required women to be advised before making a choice up to the 12th week of pregnancy. After that time, the decision was to be made by a committee.{{sfn|Roseneil, et al.|2010|p=145}} ''Sirene'' published its final issue in 1983.{{sfn|Danielsen|2010|p=39}}

===Sweden===
In 1968, {{ill|Karin Westman Berg|sv}} began giving a series of lectures on [[women's history]] at [[Uppsala University]] in a newly developed class on [[gender]]. Two of her students, Birgitta Bolinder and {{ill|Birgitta Svanberg|sv}}, who were working teachers attended Berg's night classes. Deciding to form a discussion group, eight of the students founded ''[[Group 8 (Sweden)|Grupp 8]]'' (Group 8) to evaluate the gender and class struggle. The study group operated for two years, but {{ill|Gunilla Thorgren|sv}} felt they needed to become more active.{{sfn|Harr|2014}}{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=18}} In 1970, ''Grupp 8'' opened to new members, attracting around 100 interested women at their first meeting in [[Stockholm]]{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=19}} and soon spread throughout Sweden. That same year women in [[Lund]], established ''Kvinnoligan'' (Women's League), after a member brought the book ''[[Sisterhood is Powerful]]'' home after a visit to the United States.{{sfn|University of Gothenburg|2011}} Both groups were formed from women who had come out of male-dominated leftist organizations where women's roles were marginalized{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=19}} and they shunned [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] organization, relying on discussion groups for women to increase their awareness through consciousness-raising.{{sfn|University of Gothenburg|2011}}

Leading up to the 1970 elections, members of ''Grupp 8'' protested at the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] (SAP) rally outside the [[Parliament House, Stockholm|Parliament building]]. Rolling out banners with slogans, {{ill|Iréne Matthis|sv}} took the microphone to ask why women were forced to work as part-time employees and thus were ineligible for [[pension]]s. Members of the [[Swedish Trade Union Confederation]] forced the activists away, threatening them with their fists.{{sfn|Harr|2014}} That same year two members, Maud Hägg and Barbro Werkmäster published ''{{ill|Frihet, jämlikhet och systerskap|sv}}'' (Freedom, Equality and Sisterhood).{{sfn|''Skånska Dagbladet''|2018}} In February 1971, the [[Studentafton]] at [[Lund University]] scheduled a meeting which was later called ''The Women's Camp'' inviting liberationists from Denmark, the [[United Kingdom]] and members from ''Grupp 8''. Over 1,000 women and men participated in the event, the first women's meeting held in the era in Sweden, which prompted a surge of growth in ''Kvinnoligan'',{{sfn|University of Gothenburg|2011}} with branches forming in Malmö.{{sfn|Sarrimo|2003}} Around the same time, ''Grupp 8'' founded a journal ''Kvinnobulletinen'' (Women's Bulletin),{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=19}} outlining their aims and began publishing on a variety of issues such as employment reforms, free childcare centers, unrestricted access to [[abortion]], and the objectification of women.{{sfn|University of Gothenburg|2011}} Initial articles were written from a Marxist perspective, emphasizing the needs of [[Working class|working-class]] women,{{sfn|Dahlerup|Gulli|2013|pp=28–29}}{{sfn|Elgán|2002}} but by 1972, these had been replaced with feminist articles addressing such issues as [[pornography]] and [[prostitution]].{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=20}}

Both groups addressed issues through direct action, using demonstrations, heckling, street theatre performances, and art exhibitions, such as a demonstration held on 8 March 1971, by ten members of ''Grupp 8'' who protested for daycare centers and unrestricted abortion in Stockholm.{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=20}}{{sfn|University of Gothenburg|2011}}  The following year, working with members of the {{ill|Swedish Women's Left-wing Association|sv|Svenska Kvinnors Vänsterförbund}} ({{lang-sv|Svenska Kvinnors Vänsterförbund}}), liberationists organized the first public participation in what would become an annual International Women's Day event.{{sfn|University of Gothenburg|2011}} A month later, on 8 April 1972, ''Grupp 8'' hosted an exhibition "Women" at the ''[[Moderna Museet]]'' which featured various aspects of women's lives, including intimate details, like [[menstruation]]. 13,000 people visited the installation within a month, spurred by media reports which not only analyzed the exhibit, but ridiculed the liberationists as well, characterizing them as "ugly and sexually frustrated".{{sfn|Harr|2014}} That same year the SAP added initiatives to their platform to address women's issues, over the protests of ''Grupp 8'', which believed that the patriarchal state was hijacking the movement.{{sfn|Sarrimo|2003}}

In 1973, members of the ''Grupp 8'' in [[Gothenburg]] broke away from the organization and formed a group called ''Nyfeministerna''
(The New Feminists), as they felt the ''Grupp 8'' branch lacked focus on feminist issues and women's solidarity.{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=20}} Simultaneously, a group of members left the Stockholm branch of ''Grupp 8'' and formed ''Arbetets kvinnor'' (Women Workers), accusing their chapter of being too feminist and not focusing enough on class struggle.{{sfn|University of Gothenburg|2011}} ''Grupp 8'' nevertheless continued to be the main organization in Sweden advocating for women.{{sfn|Solheim|2000|p=52}} [[Lesbian]] women were active in ''Grupp 8'', and after 1974, in the Lesbian Front, which formed in that year.{{sfn|University of Gothenburg|2011}} In 1975, inspired by [[Susan Brownmiller]]'s ''[[Against Our Will]]'', [[Maria-Pia Boëthius]] began a series of articles in the newspaper ''[[Expressen]]'' to bring the discussion of rape into the public sphere. The following year, she published ''Skylla sig själv'' (Self-blame) analyzing [[victim blaming]] by the male-dominated legal system.
{{sfn|Miller|2013|pp=28–29}}

In 1976, the ''Sexualbrottsutredningen'' (Sexual Crimes Investigation), which had been commissioned by the government in 1971 was published.{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=27}} The investigating committee, composed of eight men over the age of 60 and one woman,{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=28}} produced an analysis which recommended that penalties for sexual violence be minimized, that victim's behavior mitigate the severity of the crime, and that age requirements concerning sexual acts involving children be lowered, in the case of sexual touching to as low as ten years-of-age.{{sfn|Miller|2013|pp=29–30}} ''Grupp 8'' immediately came out against the recommendations and encouraged other activists to follow their lead.{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=30}} Organizing around 500,000 women, from thirteen women's groups, the liberationists prepared a joint statement criticizing the report. The press surrounding the outcry raised awareness on the issue, forcing the government to abandon the plan to revise statutes.{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=31}}

The ''Kvinnofronten'' (Women's Front) was formed in 1977, when a large portion of the membership of ''Grupp 8'' left over what they saw as insufficient attention to the opposition to pornography. Those who joined ''Kvinnofronten'' branched across Sweden with focus on eliminating the objectification of women, providing free childcare, and a 6-hour work day.{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=21}} By 1978, participation in events was declining. There were only 2,000 participants in 8 March events that year,{{sfn|University of Gothenburg|2011}} and by the early 1980s, the liberationist movement had given way.{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=22}}

==Spain==
The first liberationist group to form in [[Barcelona]] began in 1970, when [[María José Ragué]] returned from an extended stay in the [[United States]] and invited women to meet in her home to discuss Women's Liberation. A similar group was formed in the home of [[Laura Tremosa]] in 1975. The women held consciousness-raising sessions in clandestine meetings which were forbidden by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s regime.{{sfn|Bermúdez|Johnson|2018|p=283}} Underground meetings were also held in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] as early as 1974.{{sfn|Colectivo Feminista Lanbroa|2011|p=3}} Many feminist activists were also anti-Francoist activists and though they were politically left-leaning, none of the leftist parties had women's agendas nor policies which allowed for women's participation.{{sfn|Bermúdez|Johnson|2018|p=284}}

The day after Franco's death, Tremosa, along with Mireia Bofil, {{ill|Amparo Moreno|es}}, and [[Núria Pompeia]], among others founded on 21 November 1975 the Asociación de Comunicación Humana y Ecología (Association for Human Communication and Ecology, ANCHE). The name was specifically chosen not to alarm authorities, but their stated goals were to create an autonomous women's liberation group.{{sfn|Bermúdez|Johnson|2018|p=283}} Liberationists in general sought to redefine women's identity in Spain. A slogan "sexuality is not maternity" became popular at the beginning of the movement and women pressed for the right to have access to contraception and abortion.{{sfn|Bermúdez|Johnson|2018|p=330}}

In December 1975, the [[Communist Party of Spain|Communist Party]] provided support for a clandestine meeting of some 400 women in [[Madrid]], who participated in the ''Pimeras Journadas Nacionales por la Liberación de la Mujer'' (First National Conference for the Liberation of Women). The conference spawned the creation of the {{ill|Women's Liberation Front (Spain)|lt=Women's Liberation Front|es|Frente de Liberación de la Mujer}} ({{lang-es|Frente de Liberación de la Mujer (FLM)}}), which soon had 200 subgroups around the country.{{sfn|Bermúdez|Johnson|2018|p=302}}{{sfn|Arriero Ranz|2011|pp=59–62}} Members of the FLM included [[Celia Amorós]], [[Elena Arnedo]] and [[Gloria Nielfa]]. In 1976 the ''Jornades Catalanes de la Dona'' (Catalan Conference on Women) was held at the [[University of Barcelona]] with 4,000 attendees. At the conference, ideas about women's sexuality, including the individual rights of women regarding their own bodies were introduced.{{sfn|Bermúdez|Johnson|2018|p=302}} Soon after the conference, {{ill|Lidia Falcón|es}} founded the ''Colectivo Feminista de Barcelona'' (Feminist Collective of Barcelona){{sfn|Genderhacker|2013}} and with {{ill|Carmen Alcalde|es}}, began publishing the journal, ''{{ill|Vindicación feminist|ca}}'' (Feminist Vindication).{{sfn|Bermúdez|Johnson|2018|p=302}}

The arrest of eleven women regarding abortion in the Basque town of [[Basauri]] in September 1976, mobilized women throughout the country to demand control of their own reproductive rights, and led to the first demonstration held in Madrid since 1936.{{sfn|Bermúdez|Johnson|2018|pp=302–303}} That same year, the ''Colectivo Feminista Lanbroa'' (Lanbroa Feminist Collective) was formed in [[Bilbao]] by {{ill|María José Urruzola|es}}.{{sfn|Mendizabal Fundarena|2001|p=140}}{{sfn|Falcon|2006}} The group's main concerns were elimination of patriarchy in educational, health, judicial and political systems, with a focus on the right to divorce and control their own reproduction.{{sfn|Colectivo Feminista Lanbroa|2011|p=3}} In [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], the ''Colectivo grupo Terra'' (Collective Group Terra) was formed by members seeking liberationist ideals.{{sfn|Gahete Muñoz|2017|p=588}}{{sfn|Aguado Higón|2011|p=341}} In 1977, feminists in the Basque Country held the ''I Journadas de la Mujer de Euskadi'' (First Conference of Basque Women) in Bilbao, identifying two main threads of feminism—those who saw women's oppression as rooted in [[sexism]] and the political feminists who wanted legal reform.{{sfn|Bermúdez|Johnson|2018|p=331}}{{sfn|Mendizabal Fundarena|2001|p=140}} That same year in [[Mallorca]], the ''Colectivo Feminista Pelvis'' (Pelvis Feminist Collective) was organized.{{sfn|Gahete Muñoz|2017|p=588}}

In 1978, the law restricting contraception was stricken, which was seen as a victory by liberationists.{{sfn|Bermúdez|Johnson|2018|p=330}} In 1979, a joint protest with members of the ''Colectivo Feminista Pelvis'', ''Grup per l'Alliberament de la Dona'' (Group for Women's Liberation) and ''Mujeres Independientes'' (Independent Women) was staged in Mallorca with demonstrators carrying funerary wreaths. The action brought attention to the recent deaths of three young women from [[sexual violence]], calling for an end to [[sexual abuse]] and a judicial system which allowed men to use alcohol or [[Crime of passion|passion]] as mitigating factors for their behaviors.{{sfn|Rodriguez|1979}} The liberationist element of Spanish feminism was always the smallest sector, and the 1970s drew to a close, many of the women who had been involved in the [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]] began transitioning into organizations which were political.{{sfn|Gahete Muñoz|2017|p=588}}

==Switzerland==
The [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]] in [[Switzerland]] ({{lang-de|Frauenbefreiungsbewegung (FBB}}) was formed in 1969 following student protests the previous year in [[Zürich|Zurich]].{{sfn|Joris|2008}} FBB groups sprang up in [[Basel]], [[Bellinzona]], [[Bern]], [[Geneva]], [[Lausanne]], and [[Locarno]].{{sfn|Kommission für Frauenfragen|2000}} The group became loosely affiliated with similar organizations like the ''Mouvement pour la Libération de la femme'' (MLF) in French-speaking cities in the country and the ''Movimento Femminista Ticinese'' (MFT) in the [[Canton of Ticino]], an Italian-speaking area. Women affiliated with the movement challenged [[patriarchy]], the position of women in society and the double moral standard imposed upon women. Calling for free [[abortion]] and [[Birth control|contraception]] as well as day care centers,{{sfn|Joris|2008}} membership expanded rapidly.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2007}} Women's liberation groups in Switzerland were distinguished from other feminist activists by their focus on women's rights to control their own bodies and sexuality, as well as their direct actions aimed at provoking the public and making society aware of the issues faced by women.{{sfn|Kiani|2017|p=19}}

The groups took to the street, protesting and engaging in public controversies to bring attention to discrepancies between men's and women's lives, like the inability of women to vote, an education system which made housekeeping courses mandatory for women, and a ban on women's participating in the country's defense. Their first public action was a protest against [[objectification]], but they also demonstrated for equal pay, revision of the marriage laws, retraining of [[Housewife|housewives]] to enter the work force, and improved social benefits for women.{{sfn|Kommission für Frauenfragen|2000}} As early as 1970, the FBB in [[Zurich]] began organizing an experimental kindergarten and unlike in other places, established a formal board.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2007}} In 1971, the FBB and Progressive Women of Basel organized a petition drive to collect signatures to remove the criminal status from abortion.{{sfn|Kommission für Frauenfragen|2000}}

By 1972, the FBB-Zurich opened the first women's center in Switzerland, Information Center for Women ({{lang-de|Informationsstelle für Frauen (INFRA)}}). The idea for the center was proposed by a consciousness-raising group which discussed sexuality and enlightenment and the center offered counseling on abortion, contraceptives, as well as giving general information on education, alternative medicine, and legal issues. In 1974, a [[lesbian]] organization known as the ''Homosexuelle Frauengruppe'' (HFG) took space in the INFRA building and affiliated with many of the goals and projects of the FBB. The HFG published a journal and founded a women's bookshop, before formally merging with the FBB in 1980.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2007}} During the 1975 conference held for [[International Women's Year]] taking place in Bern, members of the FBB held a counter-conference to include issues that progressives omitted, like abortion, homosexuality, women prisoners and immigrants.{{sfn|Kommission für Frauenfragen|2000}}

FBB members were more radical than the conservative members of reformist feminist groups which emerged in their wake. In 1977, some adherents split off to join with socialist feminists. Increasingly FBB groups focused on [[violence against women]] and provided counseling services to abused women.{{sfn|Kommission für Frauenfragen|2000}} The Zurich FBB dissolved in 1989.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2007}}

==United Kingdom==
The Women's Liberation Movement in the UK was spurred not only by events occurring in the United States, but by events within the nation which forced women to think in different ways about their political lives. Two important events, the [[Ford sewing machinists strike of 1968|Dagenham Ford Plant strike]] by women machinists in 1968 over pay inequality and a campaign launched the same year by women in Hull over local fishermen's safety, led to a desire for women throughout the nation to organize.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=16}} Student activists in France and the UK were involved in protests over [[Apartheid]] and the [[Vietnam War]], radicalizing them, but many women who joined leftist movement felt relegated to the sidelines.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=31–32}} Advertising for members to form local consciousness-raising groups, women brought other women to the movement and it grew rapidly.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=45}} Using U.S. [[Redstockings|Redstocking activist]], [[Kathie Sarachild]]'s articles as a guide, women learned how to analyze issues impacting their own lives and question whether those challenges were broadly effecting other women, giving each woman a personal stake in the outcome of the movement.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=47–48}}

The first [[National Women's Liberation Movement Conference]], attended by around 600 women took place in Britain, for three days, from 27 February 1970, at [[Ruskin College]].{{sfn|Barber, et al.|2013}}{{sfn|Cochrane|2010}} At the conference the liberationists laid out their focus areas, which included child care, equal education and opportunity, pay equity, and reproductive rights.{{sfn|Connolly|1997|p=104}} In 1970, British feminist [[Germaine Greer]] published her book, ''[[The Female Eunuch]]'', which garnered international acclaim from feminists on an international scale.{{sfn|Wilde|Hooton|Andrews|1994|p=271}} The following year, [[Juliet Mitchell]]'s ''Woman's Estate'' was released and extracts of the book were widely disseminated and discussed in local consciousness raising sessions.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=51}} Also in 1971 the British edition of ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'', originally written by the Boston Women's Health Book Collective, was edited and published by [[Angela Phillips]] and [[Jill Rakusen]] in England, becoming an important text, urging women to become familiar with their own bodies.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=67}}{{sfn|Guest|2010}} Another important text, ''The Power of Women and the Subversion of the Community'' (1972) by [[Selma James]] and [[Mariarosa Dalla Costa|Mariosa Dalla Costa]] examined the place of women in terms of paid and unpaid labor.{{sfn|Stoller|2018|p=98}} The book led to several chapters of the [[Wages for housework]] (WFH) campaign in Britain and other countries.{{sfn|Stoller|2018|p=98}} Topics of relationships, marriage and sexuality were often discussed in groups, evaluating duty, domestic life and women's sphere in ways which allowed women to build confidence and share things like homosexuality or abuse, which had previously been taboo subjects.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=52–54}} Writing about women's history became very important during the WLM in the UK.{{sfn|Hannam|2008}}

Abortion was a unifying issue for liberationists throughout the nation, but while the focus throughout the UK included reproduction and contraception, in some localities, such as Scotland, the focus was solely on abortion.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=127–128}} The [[Abortion Act 1967|British Abortion Act of 1967]] was passed to eliminate unsupervised primitive and unhygienic procedures and had little to do with women's rights to govern their own bodies.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=114–116}} From the emergence of the WLM in Britain activists felt the importance of shifting the debate to self-determination.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=117}} In 1975, the [[National Abortion Campaign]] (NAC) was formed to organize the push toward choice.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=119}} Distrust between NAC, unions and WLM activists led to several fissures, but despite the uneasy alliance the groups worked together and there was some fluidity with activists participating in multiple factions for the cause.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=121–122}} A series of proposals were introduced in the 1970s, starting with [[James White (Scottish politician)|James White]]’s 1975 bill to restrict abortion on the basis of gestation; [[Bill Benyon]]’s 1977 bill to not only limit abortion based upon gestation time but to give medical professionals an opt-out to refuse; and then in 1979, a bill introduced by [[John Corrie]] to restrict not only gestation but the grounds on which abortion could be attained.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=125–126}} Further complicating the debate was the paucity of [[National Health Service]] facilities throughout the UK, giving women in southern England readily available abortion centers, which were lacking in other areas of the nation.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=128}} Though there were a wide variety of views among individual liberationists on the topic, the movement was in favor of women's autonomy over their own bodies.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=133}}

Another critical area of work during the period focused on violence against women. Out of consciousness raising sessions, women wanted to find means to combat violence and bring the problem into the public sphere.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=143}} Liberationists created the National Women's Aid Federation in 1974 and eventually branches were established in each of the four countries. The central body was critical for networking, as well as attaining government funds to assist with the work.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=147}} In 1977, the British edition of [[Susan Brownmiller]]'s ''[[Against Our Will]]'' was published and became an influential text, showing how rape had been weaponized throughout history. In response liberationists throughout the UK worked to shift the focus away from women's behaviour toward the perpetrator. Through establishment of Rape Crisis Centres, they led the effort to provide support to victims and campaigned for change, publishing articles to increase awareness among the public.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=158}}

Conferences throughout Britain occurred at varied locations, including [[Sheffield]] (June 1970), [[Skegness]] (1971), [[Manchester]] (March 1972), London (November 1972), [[Bristol]] (1973), [[Edinburgh]] (1974), Manchester (1975), Newcastle (1976), London (1977) and [[Birmingham]] (1978).{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=82}} Though changing the location was meant to unify the women, it led to feelings in some quarters that the long journeys to nationwide conferences were marginalizing women from other parts of the country. When publications supposedly representative of all groups and subgroups in the country appeared to be London-centric, activists in the north, felt alienated.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=101–102}} At the 1974 conference of the WLM in Edinburgh two additional goals—economic and legal independence for women and the right to autonomy over their sexuality, free from discrimination—were adopted.{{sfn|Barber, et al.|2013}}{{sfn|Connolly|1997|p=104}} During the 1975 conference in Manchester, liberationists decided to create the [[Women’s Information and Referral Service]] (WIRES), which both produced a newsletter for women in Leeds and York, but acted as a [[news agency|news service]] to distribute information to the other groups and subgroups of liberationists throughout the nation.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=85}} At the eighth and final conference, held in 1978 in Birmingham, liberationists added a demand for freedom from violence.{{sfn|Barber, et al.|2013}}{{sfn|Connolly|1997|p=104}}

By the end of the 1970s the movement had grown so large that it was difficult to sustain the personal and individual aspects which characterized the early movement. Conferences in Britain numbering near 3,000 participants made it difficult for individual activists to have a say in shaping policy or in discussions. Fragmentation on issues which were important to their personal political perspectives, was common for activists in the later part of the movement. In the drive to move from theory to action, liberationists began working on single-issue campaigns to ensure that gains which had been made were not rolled back. In addition, as the state had reformed many policies toward women and political and economic situation had shifted dramatically, activists felt a need to shift the way that they engaged with the state and public.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=181–182}}

===England===
The WLM movement emerged as groups of women took part in local campaigns or more traditional lobbies and marches in support of civil rights, peace and the [[New Left]]. Their activities were triggered by a period of rapid social and cultural change in the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to WLM meetup centres in private houses and community centers, magazines, leaflets and posters were published by the women who gathered there.{{sfn|Barber, et al.|2013}} "Consciousness raising" groups appeared in the early 1970s, where women talked about their own life experiences together in different locations throughout [[London]].{{sfn|Barrington|2003|pp=14–16}} Women were also able to recognize the unpaid labor that women do every day, including [[Homemaking|housework]], [[emotional labor]] and care-giving.{{sfn|Stoller|2018|p=95}} The first national WLM conference took place in late February and early March 1970 at [[Oxford]]. There were more than 600 women in attendance where they discussed four primary issues: Equal pay, equal education and job opportunities, free contraception and abortion on demand and free 24 hour nurseries.{{sfn|The British Library|2015}}

In November 1970, protesters went to [[Royal Albert Hall]] to protest the [[Miss World]] pageant and challenge the idea of women being judged by their physical appearance. Protesters had fliers and shouted, "We're not beautiful, we're not ugly, we're angry!"{{sfn|Robinson|2011}}{{sfn|Campbell|2010}} This protest was organised by Jane Grant and protesters threw out "leaflets, bags of flour and smoke bombs".{{sfn|Campbell|2010}} Several of the women, including [[Jenny Fortune]], who had brought a "busload of women from [[University of Essex|Essex University]]", were arrested and conducted their own defence in court.{{sfn|Campbell|2010}} The protesters, numbering around 50 or so women, were fined 100 pounds and the Women's Liberation Network paid the fines for the women.{{sfn|Peck|2011}} ''[[The Guardian]]'' called the protest a "galvanising moment in the women's liberation movement".{{sfn|Bindel|2011}} An earlier, smaller protest of 50 women who called themselves the Women's Liberation Workshop, had taken place the year before in 1969.{{sfn|''The Lawton Constitution''|1969|p=5}}

The Women's Liberation Network formed in [[north London]] in the early 1970s,{{sfn|Hughes|2015|p=203}} a WLM group began in [[Bolton]] in 1970 with three members, a group formed in [[Norwich]], as did one in [[Bristol]].{{sfn|Bruley|2016|p=725}} Groups started publishing newsletters to inform activists of developments and by the mid-1970s most towns and cities throughout England had a group publishing about local WLM happenings. The newsletters were critical as many families still did not have home telephones.{{sfn|Bruley|2016|p=726}} ''[[Spare Rib]]'' was launched in July 1972 and became popular throughout the UK. Other English publications which became important included ''Shrew'', ''Women's Report'' and ''Women's Voice''.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=85}} Women involved in the WLM in England felt that it was a time "of enormous innocence, enthusiasm and creative power, when small groups of women were forming across the country, talking about their circumstances, and feeling the rush of recognition as they realised they weren't alone in their frustrations".{{sfn|Cochrane|2010}}

In 1972, one of the first shelters for victims of domestic violence was set up in England. It was called [[Refuge (United Kingdom charity)|Chiswick Women's Aid]] and was largely steered by [[Erin Pizzey]].{{sfn|Renzetti|Edleson|2008|p=126}} The first [[Rape crisis center|rape crisis centre]] was opened in 1973 for England and Wales.{{sfn|The British Library|2015}}{{sfn|Rape Crisis England &amp; Wales|2015}} The Bristol Women's Centre opened that same year and one of the services they offered was pregnancy testing, vital when no self-testing existed in the period. They also had a space to offer emergency shelter to "battered women", as victims of violence were called at the time. In other areas, women's centres became hubs for activists in the movement, for example, the centre in Norwich had meeting space for consciousness-raising groups and training, provided advice services on a variety of issues like health, housing, and marriage, as well as offering pregnancy tests. In Brighton, the women's centre, opened in 1974, was next door to the women's shelter, allowing women the pretext of going to the centre, when they were actually fleeing violence. By 1979, more than forty women's centres offered a variety of services throughout the country.{{sfn|Bruley|2016|pp=729–730}}

In 1973, black British women organised the [[Brixton Black Women's Group]] to focus on education and contraceptive issues in their community.{{sfn|The British Library|2015}}{{sfn|Black Cultural Archives|2013|p=4}}{{sfn|Agyepong|2016}} Women who were former [[British Black Panthers]], such as [[Olive Morris]], [[Beverley Bryan|Beverly Bryan]] and [[Liz Obi]], were involved in this group. The organisation was the first black women's group in the UK.{{sfn|Agyepong|2016}} Morris also helped start other women's groups such as the Manchester Black Women's Co-operative, the Black Women's Mutual Aid Group, The [[Organisation of Women of Asian and African Descent]] (OWAAD) and a self-help bookstore, the Sarbarr Bookshop.{{sfn|Noha|2016}} OWAAD formed in 1978{{sfn|The British Library|2015}} and in March 1979 sponsored a conference, where around 250 met to talk about the multiple issues they faced based on their gender, race and class. Many of the members were immigrants from various British colonies and were concerned with the impact of immigration laws on their communities.{{sfn|''The Guardian''|1979|p=7}} Founding a journal, ''FOWAAD,'' with the purpose of keeping women involved connected and informed, one of their first direct actions was a sit-in at [[Heathrow Airport]] to protest virginity tests given to women upon entering the UK.{{sfn|Brixton Black Women's Group|1984|pp=84–85}}

The [[Women's Aid Federation of England]] was founded by liberationists in 1974 to specifically work on the issues of domestic violence.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=147}} The following year, the [[National Abortion Campaign]] (NAC) formed{{sfn|The British Library|2015}} to defend abortion rights, advocate for further improvements and extensions of reproductive rights, and promote awareness of family planning services and contraceptives.{{sfn|''Women's International Network News''|1991|p=25}} In June 1975, NAC staged a demonstration that attracted between 15,000 and 20,000 people.{{sfn|Potts|Diggory|Peel|1977|p=326}} NAC fought against various [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House Of Commons]]' Bills that were intended to restrict abortion rights,{{sfn|Hoggart|2000|pp=109–110}} creating alliances with organisations that worked with "other oppressed and exploited groups".{{sfn|Hoggart|2000|p=111}}

There were conflicts within the WLM in how they approached the subject of abortion on England.{{sfn|Jolly|2014|p=101}} Women in the WLM criticised labor unions for not going far enough in political support for free abortions on demand.{{sfn|Jolly|2014|p=103}} Nevertheless, the [[Trades Union Congress|Trade Union Congress]] (TUC) and the NAC along with the [[Committee in Defence of the 1967 Act]] (CoOrd) planned an October 1979 march in support of abortion rights.{{sfn|Jolly|2014|p=101}} The march was the largest pro-abortion march in the country and was part of the Campaign Against the Corrie Bill (CACB).{{sfn|Jolly|2014|p=101}}{{sfn|Hoggart|2000|p=112}} The differences between the organisers of the pro-abortion march led to an "angry clash" with radical feminists from the London Women's Liberation and Women's Aid holding up the parade because they felt they, not the other organisations should lead it.{{sfn|Jolly|2014|p=103}} NAC was criticized by some feminists for working with male bureaucracies, but maintained a policy that all allies, regardless of their roots, who were working against the Corrie Bill to restrict abortion rights were critical to defeat the bill.{{sfn|Hoggart|2000|p=113}}

The [[Women's Therapy Centre]], founded to provide counseling and help with mental health issues, was established in London in 1976 by [[Susie Orbach]] and [[Luise Eichenbaum]].{{sfn|The British Library|2015}}{{sfn|Women's Therapy Centre|2013}} To assist women with education and bring women to the movement, many WLM members taught courses with the [[Worker's Educational Association]] (WEA). Some of these began as courses on the movement and then became the foundation of university classes of women's studies. Activists in Norwich gave talks to church groups, members of the [[National Women's Register|Housewives Register]] and at [[Women's Institutes]], but in the conservative climate were less bold than activists in other areas. Brighton's liberationists ran a successful course on the issues of the movement in 1978 and were asked to re-run it the following year.{{sfn|Bruley|2016|p=727}}

After a [[serial rapist]] attacked and killed five women in [[West Yorkshire]] with little response from the police, liberationists in [[Leeds]] organized the Leeds Rape Crisis Centre and planned a conference to discuss violence against women.{{sfn|Bruley|2016|p=731}} They organized the first [[Reclaim the Night]] march in 1977 to challenge the idea that women should stay inside after dark in order to avoid rape and assault.{{sfn|Bindel|2006}} Reclaim the Night protests spread to Bolton and Brighton and a national march was held in London on 20 January 1979.{{sfn|Bruley|2016|p=731}} The ''Guardian'' reported in 1979 that the marches had had "little attention except for a few sneers and weak jokes".{{sfn|''The Guardian''|1979|p=11}} However, the marches took place in 12 locations in England and involved hundreds of women. Reclaim the Night inspired the [[Take Back the Night (organization)|Take Back the Night]] movement in the United States.{{sfn|Bindel|2006}}

In the late 1970s, [[Separatist feminism|revolutionary feminism]] took off in England, with more militant feminists who were inspired by a workshop and a conference paper at the National Women's Liberation Conference of 1977.{{sfn|Rees|2010a|p=177}} Revolutionary liberationists tended to be separatist, adhered to a doctrine of political lesbianism and directed their actions toward pornography, sexual abuse, and sexual violence.{{sfn|Rees|2010a|p=178}} They argued that "male violence against women is an expression of male supremacy and political control of women"{{sfn|Rees|2010b|p=348}} and conceptualized gender as class, in which all men held the power positions and all women were the exploited class.{{sfn|Rees|2010b|p=343}} Increasingly, revolutionary feminists refused to engage with men, even those who engaged in similar social struggles.{{sfn|Rees|2010b|p=350}} After 1977, more women's journals and documents were known to be or designated as items to be read by women only{{sfn|Rees|2010a|p=180}} and by the 1978 nationwide conference fractures between liberationist and separatist feminists disrupted the conference and led to a collapse of the plenary session. The emotional response to the conference led to no one wanting to take on the responsibility of organizing further conferences.{{sfn|Rees|2010b|pp=350–351}}

In 1979, the [[Southall Black Sisters]] formed to address violence against women and address issues within the black and Asian communities. Based on a liberationist model, they offered consciousness-raising discussions, counseling services and information in a multi-lingual format.{{sfn|The British Library|2015}}{{sfn|Cohen|2011}} [[Sheba Feminist Press]] opened in 1980,{{sfn|The British Library|2015}} with the purpose of expanding printing services to women and translating works from other languages to English. They were accused of spreading erotica or lesbian propaganda by Conservatives in the government.{{sfn|Mackie|1981|p=2}} Through the late 1980s, a liberationist group in Norwich was continuing direct action and protest on the issues of violence against women;{{sfn|Bruley|2016|p=735}} however, most liberationists by the 1980s were transitioning away from direct action and recognizing that they had to find ways to engage with local, regional and national governments and agencies.{{sfn|Bruley|2016|p=736}}

===Northern Ireland===
In [[Northern Ireland]], the idea of Women's Liberation was often bound to the [[The Troubles|Nationalist Troubles]] of the era. Difficulties in advocating for women's rights when adherence to religious norms on morality and reproduction had become politicized, created a climate where advocates often had to shift focus to maintain an apolitical stance.{{sfn|Aughey|Morrow|2014|p=173}} During the period of [[Direct rule (Northern Ireland)|Direct Rule]], it was difficult for women to unite in a single struggle against patriarchy as the entire society was divided between whether there should be a United Ireland or a United Kingdom.{{sfn|Rynder|2002|pp=44–45}} Further, as men were [[Operation Demetrius|interned]], women were increasingly involved in developing coping mechanisms to care for their families and the violence surrounding them.{{sfn|Begoña|1995}}

The [[Northern Ireland Women's Rights Movement]] (NIWRM), formed in 1975, tried to achieve neutrality by focusing on employment rights and sexism.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=17}} As an umbrella organization with a formal charter and a mission aimed toward reforming legislation, by bringing Britain's sex discrimination laws to Northern Ireland, it was not a liberationist organization.{{sfn|Hill|2010|p=889}}{{sfn|Hill|McAuley|McLaughlin|Porter|2006|p=17}} However, the Women's Aid Federation, which was developed by a group of women who broke away from NIWRM,{{sfn|Hill|2010|p=889}} in 1977, was based on a non-hierarchical structure and formed from the Liberation Movement. Groups were autonomous and were open to all women, regardless of their political affiliation. The organizational goals were to provide refuges from family violence for women and children{{sfn|McMillan|2007|p=6-7}} and they established groups in Belfast, Coleraine and Derry, spreading to Newry, North Down and Omagh in the 1980s.{{sfn|Hill|2010|p=889}}

Three London-based collectives working with women in Northern Ireland were the Women on Ireland Collective, Women and Ireland Group and the London-Armagh Coordinating Group. Each of these groups were autonomous organizations without a hierarchical organizational structure and affiliated with British WLM organizations, though they did not focus directly on patriarchal inequalities.{{sfn|Dawson|Dover|Hopkins|2017|p=154}} The Women on Ireland Collective formed in 1974 and existed for one year. Members were all from Northern Ireland, members of the English WLM, and their work focused on improving awareness in Britain about Northern Irish women in working-class neighborhoods.{{sfn|Dawson|Dover|Hopkins|2017|p=156}} Members worked to publicise the issues in Northern Ireland through conferences and public meetings,{{sfn|Dawson|Dover|Hopkins|2017|p=157}} as well as through public demonstrations protesting prisoners' rights. After calling a hunger strike for two sisters, [[Marian Price|Marian]] and [[Dolours Price]], and equating the government response of their [[force-feeding]] to [[suffragette]]s who had faced similar measures, the group drew harsh criticism from other members of the WLM. The Price sisters were seen as combatants because of their involvement with bombings and the controversy led to the dissolution of the collective in 1975.{{sfn|Dawson|Dover|Hopkins|2017|pp=157–158}}

The Women and Ireland Group was formed in 1976 from some of the members of the Women on Ireland Collective.{{sfn|Dawson|Dover|Hopkins|2017|p=159}} They participated in the rally held for the [[Community for Peace People|Peace People]] in [[Trafalgar Square]] in November 1976, but as opposition to the peace activists because of their support for the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], as opposed to being neutral.{{sfn|Dawson|Dover|Hopkins|2017|pp=158–159}} The group, like its predecessor focused on support for working class women in Northern Ireland and raising awareness among British WLM members. Branches formed in Bristol, Brighton, Dundee and Manchester and increasingly worked with women political prisoners, before dissolving in 1980.{{sfn|Dawson|Dover|Hopkins|2017|p=161}} London-Armagh Coordinating Group, typically known as the Armagh Group, formed in 1980 and was active through 1987. Their activities focused on women political prisoners and prisoner rights.{{sfn|Dawson|Dover|Hopkins|2017|pp=161–162}}

===Scotland===
As in other countries within the UK, the WLM emerged in [[Scotland]] in 1970.{{sfn|Breitenbach|Mackay|2010|p=153}} Student protests and the challenges to authority that emerged in the 1960s, were key to the development of Scottish activists. Specifically the challenge to [[Malcolm Muggeridge]], rector at [[Edinburgh University]], by over his opinion regarding distributing [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]] at the Student Union. In what came to be known as the ''Muggeridge Affair'', [[Anna Coote]], at the time editor of the campus newspaper ''[[The Student (newspaper)|The Student]]'' and later a prominent liberationist, wrote a series of articles calling for him to resign. Coote's position was that as rector, Muggeridge should have put his personal convictions aside to support the student pro-distribution position, as he was their elected representative. In the wake of the criticism, Muggeridge resigned.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=27–28}}

Conscousness-raising groups quickly formed and spread throughout Scotland, and though they were locally based had ties to regional and national networks of other groups.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=63}} By 1970, groups had been established in [[Aberdeen]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow]] and [[St Andrews]], and among other places were founded in [[Dundee]] and [[Shetland]] in 1972.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=64}} Groups continued to be formed throughout the 1970s, with establishments created in [[North Lanarkshire]] with members from [[Cumbernauld]] and [[Kilsyth]] assembling in 1978 and the Falkirk Area Women's Group forming in the [[Central Lowlands]] in 1979.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=66}} The first Women's Liberation conference in Scottland was held in Glasgow in 1972 and thereafter occurred annually until 1976, when it became a twice yearly event. Conference locations shifted annually to allow women from all geographical locations to be able to participate in the events and activists donated to funds to pool monies for travel.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=81–82}}

Women's health became a focus of the WLM group from Glasgow, whereas lack of adequate childcare facilities became an important issue for groups in Aberdeen, Dundee, and Edinburgh.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=68}} Other issues, such as women's objectification were addressed in direct actions, like when Edinburgh liberationists entered "Miss Conception", "Miss Fortune", "Miss Placed", "Miss Treated, and "Miss Used" in a mock beauty pageant staged in 1975.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=69}} Similar action was taken by liberationists from Aberdeen who had been omitted from the "women's fayre" hosted at the Music Hall in celebration of [[International Women's Year]].{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=70}} Activists in Dundee protested the male-only policy of the Tay Bridge Bar and sent complaints to the licensing board about the discrimination of being forced to retire to the lounge. Similar protests were held in Aberdeen, with the goal being to generate media coverage.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=71–72}} On [[Shetland]] liberationists demonstrating against the opening of a strip club in [[Lerwick]] found themselves surrounded by religious groups who supported them, though not over their issue of women's objectification.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=72}}

Scottish liberationists who focused on the issue of [[abortion]] were aware that many of the challenges to the existing law came from Scottish politicians. Because of this, they focused more on abortion than the broader issues of reproduction and contraception.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=128, 134}} The lack of facilities in Scotland which performed abortions became an issue for liberationists, as for example, women from Shetland had no access and were forced to travel to Aberdeen for services. They campaigned for [[NHS Scotland#Health Boards|Area Health Boards]] to provide facilities in each geographical area.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=129}} Members of various WLM groups published articles on how their MPs voted on the issue; distributed guides, like the Abortion Law Reform Association's booklet, ''A Woman's Right to Choose: Action Guide'';{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=133}} and performed street theatre to highlight the perils of backstreet abortions.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=130}} Fierce debate in the period, occurred at rallies hosted by anti-abortion and pro-abortion forces, polarizing society.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=131-132}}

[[Women's studies]] courses began in Aberdeen and Edinburgh in 1974 as part of an adult education initiative. Courses in Glasgow began in 1978 as part of an initiative sponsored by the [[Workers' Educational Association]] and the Extra-Mural Department of the [[University of Glasgow]]. [[Chris Aldred]], a liberationist from Aberdeen and Margaret Marshall, head of the North of Scotland District WEA designed a ten-week programme to introduce women's education to Scottish working-class women.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=77}} From 1975, Scottish women, who had up to that point relied on English publications for information about the movement, began their own initiatives. ''The Tayside Women's Liberation Newsletter'' began in 1975 and was published by WLM groups from Dundee and St Andrews. The ''Scottish Women's Liberation Journal'' began publication in 1977, changing its name to ''MsPrint'' the following year originated in Dundee and was printed by Aberdeen People's Press. ''Nessie'', published in St Andrews, was begun in 1979.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=86–87}}

Disagreements over ideological issues with socialist feminists were prevalent from the beginning of the movement. [[Marxism|Marxist]] or [[Maoism|Maoist]] feminists believed that the focus should be on [[Class conflict|class struggle]], with recognition that certain systems were biased towards male supremacy. Liberationists argued that [[socialist feminism]] failed to recognize the differences in class struggle and women's issues, which were often sidelined by focus on class.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=87–89}} Socialist feminists also felt the focus on men as the enemy and the idea of women needing to separate themselves from men, led to misunderstandings and characterizations of feminists as man-haters{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=87, 93}} and [[lesbian]]s, regardless of their actual sexual orientation.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=91}} To many, in the period where sexuality had been a taboo topic, lesbians were seen as more "scary than scared".{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=92}} Though the movement was fluid and aimed to incorporate all women, these types of differences often led to group fractures and by the late 1970s, separate conferences were held for socialist feminists and liberationists.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=87–89}}

From the mid-1970s liberationists in Scotland focused on violence against women and reached out to other autonomous women's groups to better understand as well as combat the problem.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=170}} In 1972, activists in Edinburgh established a women's shelter to accommodate women and children.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=145}} WLM members in Glasgow opened ''Interval House'' in 1974 and that same year the groups in Aberdeen and Dundee also opened shelters.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=146}} Falkirk began planning a refuge in 1975 and opened a facility in 1976.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=147}} Scottish liberationists, who had shunned participation in formal politics because of their patriarchal and reformist tendencies, began to develop campaigns and organizational structures which engaged with the state in the late 1970s.{{sfn|Breitenbach|Mackay|2010|p=157}} The Scottish Women's Aid formed in 1976 from liberationist groups, but recognizing the need to attain funding for the organization, they created a formal structure. By 1977, there were fifteen women's shelters scattered across the country, in places like [[Clackmannan]], [[Kirkcaldy]], [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] and [[Stirling]].{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=147}}

The first Rape Crisis Centre in the Scotland was established in 1976 and by 1979 a network linking the centers across the country was established.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=156, 159}} As Scottish women were not covered by the [[Sexual Offences Act|Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act of 1976]], survivors of rape had to either have medical evidence or a witness to the violation to file charges. In addition, marital rape was not a crime. To raise awareness on the issue, WLM members wrote articles in journals and sent letters to their MPs.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=164–165}} Beginning in 1976, liberationists participated in direct protests, such as ''Witching the Meadows'', where Edinburg's WLM members dressed as witches and hexed a particularly dangerous section of [[The Meadows (park)|The Meadows Park]]. From 1977, they staged marches known as ''Reclaim the Night'' in Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow to gain publicity of the dangers to women of walking after dark.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=166–167}} The last two WLM conferences in Scotland occurred in 1987 in Glasgow and 1989 in Edinburgh.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=112}}

===Wales===
The Women's liberation movement in [[Wales]] was active in [[Cardiff]] and [[Swansea]], but also had subgroups operating in [[Aberystwyth]], [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], [[Carmarthen]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], and [[Pontypridd]].{{sfn|Rolph|2002}} The 1972 publication of ''The Descent of Woman'' by Welsh feminist and author, [[Elaine Morgan]] was influential for women involved in the movement.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=17}} In 1974, the first Welsh National Women's Liberation Conference took place in Aberystyth. In 1978, the Welsh Women's Aid federation was established,{{sfn|Cardiff Women's Aid|2016}} which was led by [[Jane Hutt]] from its founding to 1988.{{sfn|BBC|1999}} Because of the WLM, the attitude of men towards women in [[pub]]s in Wales changed, becoming less [[taboo]].{{sfn|Carradice|2011|p=200}}

The [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp|Greenham Common Peace Camp]] started in 1981. A group of women protesting [[Nuclear weapons delivery|nuclear missiles]] marched from Cardiff to the [[RAF Greenham Common|RAF Greenham]].{{sfn|The British Library|2015}} Women left their jobs and families in order to occupy the space and fight for peace in a direct action which recognized that men were responsible for most of the world's violence. Unaligned with political groups, the women gained wide support from the media and public for their stance to non-violence.{{sfn|Southwood|1982|p=20}} [[Helen John]] was one of the founders of the occupation.{{sfn|Davenport|1982|p=6}}
