'''Abortion in Australia''' is largely regulated by the [[states and territories of Australia|states and territories]] rather than the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]]. The grounds on which [[abortion]] is permitted in Australia vary by jurisdiction. In every state, abortion is legal to protect the life and health of a woman, though each state has a different definition.

Nowhere in Australia is there a requirement that a woman's sexual partner be notified of a proposed abortion or to consent to the procedure. Australian courts will not grant an injunction to restrain a pregnant woman from terminating her pregnancy, even if the applicant is the putative father of the fetus.&lt;ref name=ParlAus&gt;Parliament of Australia, [http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp9899/99rp01 Abortion Law in Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; There is also no waiting period for an abortion. A minor does not need to notify a parent of a proposed abortion nor is parental consent required, except in Western Australia. In Western Australia, a proposed abortion by a minor under 16 years of age must be notified to one of the parents, except where permission has been granted by the Children's Court or the minor does not live with her parents. 

Early-term surgical abortions are generally available around Australia for those women who seek them. The procedure is partially funded under [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]], the government-funded public health scheme, or by private healthcare insurers. Prosecutions against medical practitioners for performing abortions have not occurred for decades, with one exception – a prosecution in 1998 in Western Australia that soon after led to the explicit legalisation of on-request abortions under certain circumstances in that state. [[Mifepristone|RU-486]], an [[abortifacient]] widely used overseas, has been available in Australia only since February 2006.

In the case of 'a child capable of being born alive' (usually taken to mean after 28 weeks of pregnancy), a termination may be subject to a separate crime of [[Child destruction#Australia|child destruction]] in some States and Territories.

==History==
Abortion in Australia has always been regulated by state (previously colonial) law. Before the end of the 19th century, each colony had adopted the Imperial ''[[Offences Against the Person Act 1861]]'', which in turn was derived from English laws from [[Offences against the Person Act 1837|1837]], [[Offences against the Person Act 1828|1828]] and 1803, which made abortion illegal under any circumstance. Since then, abortion law has continued to evolve in each State by case law and changes in legislation.

A legal precedent concerning the legality of abortion was set in Australia in 1969, by the ''Menhennitt ruling'' in the Victorian Supreme Court case ''[[R v Davidson]]'',&lt;ref name="R v Davidson"&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicRp|85|1969|litigants=[[R v Davidson]] (Menhennitt ruling) |parallelcite=[1969] [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 667 |date=3 June 1969 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which held that abortion was lawfully justified if "necessary to preserve the physical or mental health of the woman concerned, provided that the danger involved in the abortion did not outweigh the danger which the abortion was designed to prevent." The ruling was later largely adopted by courts in [[New South Wales]],&lt;ref name="R v Wald"/&gt; and [[Queensland]],&lt;ref name="R v Bayliss &amp; Cullen"&gt;''[[R v Bayliss &amp; Cullen]]''  (1986) 9 Queensland Lawyer Reports 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and was influential in some other states. Over time this has come to be broadly defined so as to include the mental health of the woman, to which an unwanted pregnancy is interpreted as clinically injurious.

A number of federal politicians have expressed anti-abortion views including Senator [[Ron Boswell]] (who was for a time National Party leader in the Senate), [[Barnaby Joyce]]&lt;ref name="Australian Parliament House"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=E5D|title=Hon Barnaby Joyce MP|date=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tony Abbott]] (when he was federal [[Minister for Health (Australia)|Health Minister]]), who in 2004 described the scale of abortion as a "national tragedy".&lt;ref name=Australian&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/tony-abbott-pledges-to-make-no-changes-to-abortion-law/story-fn59niix-1225903064089|title=Tony Abbott pledges to make no changes to abortion law|date=9 August 2010|author=Nicola Berkovic|work=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s the conservative [[Howard government]] was in power in Australia, with conservative independent Tasmanian Senator [[Brian Harradine]] holding the balance of power in the Senate. Howard brokered a deal with Harradine to ensure his support for proposed bills, including the privatisation of national telecommunications provider Telecom (now [[Telstra]]). In return, Harrdine received support for introducing restrictions on abortion ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.crikey.com.au/2014/04/24/the-lethal-legacy-of-brian-harradine-his-long-war-on-womens-rights/|title=The lethal legacy of Brian Harradine: his long war on women's rights|date=24 April 2014|work=Crikey|access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Abortifacient drugs were designated as "restricted goods" which required approval from the health minister before the drug could be assessed by the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] (TGA), which was required before drugs could be sold in Australia. This created a ministerial veto over such drugs. This ensured that [[Mifepristone|RU-486]], a drug widely used overseas as an [[abortifacient]], was effectively banned in Australia until 2006. Health Minister [[Tony Abbott]], and previous ministers, used this process to prohibit the sale of RU-486 in Australia, by refusing to allow the drug to be assessed by the TGA. 

In late 2005, a [[private member's bill]] was introduced in the Senate and passed on 10 February 2006 to transfer the veto over abortifacients from the health minister to the TGA. The bill was approved by the Houses of Representatives in March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Albury, Rebecca. "Too Many, Too Late and the Adoption Alternative: Shame and Recent Abortion Debates" uow.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt; Abbott responded to the vote by calling for the addition of a Medicare item number for funding of alternative counselling to pregnant women through church-affiliated groups to lower the national abortion rate,&lt;ref name=AusDoctor&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/latest-news/abbott-floats-item-for-pre-abortion-counselling|title=Abbott floats item for pre-abortion counselling|date=17 August 2005|author=Paul Smith|work=Australian Doctor}}&lt;/ref&gt; without success. In 2010, while seeking election as Liberal Party leader, Abbott pledged not to make any changes to abortion laws, to ban funding for abortions through Medicare, or to ban drug RU-486.&lt;ref name=Australian /&gt;

In 2017 [[Cory Bernardi]] moved a motion to ban abortion on gender grounds. Queensland LNP senator [[Barry O'Sullivan]], Tasmanian Liberal [[Eric Abetz]], frontbenchers [[Zed Seselja]], [[Anne Ruston]] and [[Matt Canavan]] with One Nation's [[Fraser Anning]], [[Brian Burston]], [[Peter Georgiou]] and [[Pauline Hanson]] voted Yes on the Motion. It was voted down (10–36).&lt;ref&gt;https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/divisions/senate/2017-11-16/2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-16/bernardi-making-provocative-motions-hanson-young-fires-up/9158076&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Abortion-related violence|violence seen in the United States]] against abortion providers has generally not occurred in Australia, with two exceptions. In 2001, [[Peter James Knight|Peter Knight]] forced his way into a Melbourne clinic carrying a rifle, [[kerosene]], and equipment to lock the doors of the clinic. Three people attempted to disarm him after he pointed his rifle at a woman at the clinic. He shot and killed a security guard. Afterwards, Knight, described by the prosecution as a "hermit obsessed with killing abortion doctors" was convicted of murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSC|498|2002|litigants=R v Knight |date=19 November 2002 |court=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="australia1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1440785.stm |title=Australian abortion clinic guard killed |date=16 July 2001 |work=''BBC News''|accessdate=13 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 January 2009 A firebombing using [[Molotov cocktail]]s was attempted at a medical clinic in [[Mosman Park, Western Australia|Mosman Park]], Western Australia. Faulty construction of the bombs limited damage to a single external burnt area, though if successful damage would have been severe. It is believed that the individuals who made the attack were responsible for graffiti "baby killers" on the site, indicating an anti-abortion reason for the attack. The site turned out to in fact not be an abortion clinic, though the attackers most likely were not aware of this.&lt;ref name="australia2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/07/2460486.htm?site=local |title=Arsonists attack mosman park clinic |date=16 July 2001 |work=''BBC News''|accessdate=13 April 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another tactic adopted by anti-abortion campaigners is to form picket lines outside premises where abortions are being performed. Several states and territories set "exclusions zones" for anti-abortion protesters.

===Australian Capital Territory===
In the [[Australian Capital Territory]], reference to abortion as a criminal offence were repealed by the ''Crimes (Abolition of Offence of Abortion) Act 2002''. Before then abortion law was for many years governed by case law under sections 82–84 of the ''Crimes Act 1900'' of [[New South Wales]].

Since 2015, it is an offence to protest within 50 metres of an abortion clinic within the Australian Capital Territory (otherwise called "protest free zones").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-29/canberra-abortion-clinics-to-get-protest-free-zones/6897330]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/b/db_52769/default.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 9 of the "Human Rights Act 2004 (ACT)" confirms that the right to life applies to a person from the time of birth. Full-term abortions on demand are legal in the ACT as there are no gestational limits.

===New South Wales and Norfolk Island===
Since 1 July 2018 within [[New South Wales|NSW]] it is illegal to protest within 150m of an abortion service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sbs.com.au/news/abortion-safe-access-zones-laws-passed-in-nsw]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smh.com.au/politics/nsw/abortion-clinic-safe-access-zones-become-law-in-nsw-20180607-p4zk18.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the year 1900, within [[New South Wales]] abortion is explicitly listed as a crime under sections 82–84 of the ''Crimes Act 1900'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the interpretation of the law is subject to the ''Levine ruling'', from ''R v Wald'' of 1971,{{refn|name=R v Wald|''[[R v Wald]]'' (1971) 3 {{abbr|NSW DCR|New South Wales District Court Reports}} 25. Confirmed in ''CES v Superclinics Australia Pty Ltd''.&lt;ref name="CES v Superclinics"/&gt;}} itself derived from the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] Menhennitt ruling, which held an abortion to be legal if a doctor had an honest and reasonable belief that, due to 'any economic, social or medical ground or reason', the abortion was necessary to  'preserve the woman involved from serious danger to her life or physical or mental health which the continuance of the pregnancy would entail'.&lt;ref name="R v Wald"/&gt;

This was expanded by ''CES v Superclinics Australia Pty Ltd'' (1995),&lt;ref name="CES v Superclinics"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|103|1995|litigants=CES v Superclinics (Australia) Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(1995) 38 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 47 |courtname=[[NSW Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] (NSW, Australia)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which extended the period during which health concerns might be considered from the duration of pregnancy to any period during the woman's life, even after the birth of the child. This arguably precludes any successful prosecutions for illegal abortions. Despite this, in 2006, a doctor, Suman Sood, was convicted of two counts of performing an illegal abortion where she failed to enquire as to whether a lawful reason for performing the abortion did exist.&lt;ref name="R v Sood"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|762|2006|litigants=R v Sood (No 3) |courtname=auto |date=15 September 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/lawreport/stories/2006/1724391.htm
|title=THE SOOD ABORTION TRIAL |date=29 August 2006 |work=Radio National Law Report|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1 July 2016 all NSW laws also apply to the approximately 2,000 residents on [[Norfolk Island]], under both the ''Norfolk Island Legislation Amendment Act 2015'' and the ''Territories Legislation Amendment Act 2016'' – because the [[Norfolk Legislative Assembly]] was abolished on 1 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5440]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5619]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://regional.gov.au/territories/norfolk_island/reforms/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Greens MP Dr [[Mehreen Faruqi]] released an exposure draft of the Abortion Law Reform (Miscellaneous Acts Amendment) Bill 2016 to "Repeal sections 82–84 of the Crimes Act, relating to abortion offences; Provide for a 150m safe access zone around abortion clinics and service providers to ensure a patient's right to [[medical privacy]]; and Require doctors to disclose conscientious objection at the start of the consultation and refer patients to another doctor who does not have such an objection or to the local Women's Health NSW centre".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.end12.org.au/thegreensbill/ ABORTION LAW REFORM BILL – EXPOSURE DRAFT]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eve of the introduction of the bill on 23 June 2016, it was removed from the order of business for the following day, despite being first in the order of precedence for months, scheduled and publicly announced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mehreenfaruqi.org.au/major-parties-combine-to-derail-introduction-of-nsw-abortion-bill/ Major parties combine to derail introduction of NSW abortion bill  Posted on 23/06/2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Dr [[Mehreen Faruqi]] "introduced the first ever abortion law reform bill into NSW Parliament" on 11 August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Historic First Abortion Law Reform Bill Introduced in NSW Parliament, Posted on 11 August 2016, http://www.mehreenfaruqi.org.au/historic-first-abortion-law-reform-bill-introduced-in-nsw-parliament/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern Territory===
In the [[Northern Territory]], abortion is legal for up to 24 weeks’ gestation, implementing a 150-metre "safe access zone", removing the requirement of parental approval for abortions and providing early medical abortions with tablets.&lt;ref name="theconversation.com"/&gt; The law went into effect on 1 July 2017.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="legislation.nt.gov.au"/&gt;

===Queensland===
{{main|Abortion in Queensland}}
Prior to December 2018, abortion access in Queensland was determined by the 1986 ''McGuire ruling'', which declared abortion to be legal if necessary to preserve the woman from a serious danger to her life or health – beyond the normal dangers of pregnancy and childbirth – that would result if the pregnancy continued, and is not disproportionate to the danger being averted. Until 2008, abortion law in Queensland closely mirrored the law in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The ''McGuire ruling'' was affirmed in the 1994 case ''Veivers v. Connolly'', by a single judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland.&lt;ref name=ParlAus/&gt;

In October 2018, the Queensland parliament passed a bill by a vote of 50-41 that legalized abortion up to the twenty-second week of gestation. For abortion after the twenty-second week, two doctors must sign off on the procedure before a woman can access an abortion.&lt;ref name="Owens 2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state-politics/lnp-frontbencher-steve-minnikin-breaks-ranks-over-abortion/news-story/6870e16aea0123202336d7189e403bfd|title=Queensland parliament votes to decriminalise abortion|last=Owens|first=Jared|date=17 October 2018|website=The Australian|access-date=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation gained [[royal assent]] a week later and went into effect on 3 December 2018.&lt;ref name=QLD1/&gt;&lt;ref name=QLD2/&gt;

===South Australia===
In [[South Australia]], legislation in 1969 legalised abortion when necessary to protect the life or physical or mental health of the woman – taking into account the current and reasonably foreseeable future – or in cases when the child was likely to be born with serious handicaps. Abortions must be performed before a time limit of 28 weeks of pregnancy. Abortions must be performed in a hospital and be approved by two physicians, and are also subject to a residency requirement.(Patient must be a resident of South Australia). The hospital, dual approval and residency requirement may be waived in an emergency.  Abortions in South Australia are available for free or low cost at some of the public health facilities including The Pregnancy Advisory Centre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pregnancyadvisorycentre.com.au/&lt;/ref&gt; This Pregnancy Advisory Centre is a registered hospital with  doctors available for approval. Both medical and surgical abortions are performed.

===Tasmania===
In [[Tasmania]], since 21 November 2013, abortions are allowed on request up to 16 weeks of pregnancy. After 16 weeks abortions can be performed up to birth of the child requiring consent of two doctors on medical or psychological grounds. The law also criminalises filming, "intimidation" and "protests" (where handing out information, offering pregnant women help and support, praying, and so forth is deemed intimidating and offensive) within 150 metres of abortion clinics ("protest free zones").&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-11-22/tasmania-removes-abortion-criminal-code/5109554&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/tasmanian-abortion-law-reformed/story-e6frfku9-1226765330425&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1925 until 2001, Tasmania's Criminal Code prohibited "unlawful abortion" without actually stating what was lawful or not. While it had never actually been prosecuted, it had been held that Victoria's Menhennit ruling of 1969 and New South Wales' Levine ruling applied in Tasmanian law. In late 2001, the Criminal Code was clarified to state that an abortion must be carried out under a set of criteria resembling those of the South Australian requirements.

===Victoria===
{{main article|Abortion Law Reform Act 2008 (Victoria)}}
In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], since 2008, abortions are allowed on request up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, with abortions after that time, up until the child's birth, requiring two doctors to agree that it is appropriate, based on the woman's current and future physical, psychological and social circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;(24 August 2008). "[http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/editorial/new-law-will-not-end-abortion-controversy-20080823-40u4.html?page=-1 New law will not end abortion controversy]." ''The Age.'' Retrieved 15 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Abortion Law Reform Act 2008'' (Vic).&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2008, abortion law was based on the Victorian Crimes Act as interpreted by the ''Menhennitt ruling'' of 1969, in the case of ''[[R v Davidson]]''. Under the ruling, abortions were legal if necessary to preserve the woman from a serious danger to her life or health – beyond the normal dangers of pregnancy and childbirth – that would result if the pregnancy continued, and is not disproportionate to the danger being averted. Menhennitt's ruling remained the basis for abortion law in Victoria for almost 40 years, until the ''Abortion Law Reform Act 2008'' (Vic) formally decriminalised abortion.

===Western Australia===
In [[Western Australia]], since 20 May 1998, abortions are allowed on request up to 20 weeks of pregnancy – subject to counselling by a medical practitioner other than the one performing the abortion – or when serious personal, family or social consequences will result to the woman if an abortion is not performed, when the life or physical or mental health of the woman is endangered and when the pregnancy causes serious danger to the woman's mental health. After 20 weeks of pregnancy abortions may only be performed if the fetus is likely to be born with severe medical problems – which must be confirmed by two independently appointed doctors. In the event of the woman being under 16 years of age one of her parents must be notified, except where permission has been granted by the Children's Court or the woman does not live with her parents.&lt;ref name=childrenbychoice/&gt;

Until 1998, Western Australian law apparently mirrored that of Queensland, though it was never clarified by case law or legislation. Following the 1998 announcement of the prosecution of two [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] doctors for performing an illegal abortion – the first such prosecution in over 30 years – a private member's bill was introduced by [[Cheryl Davenport]], a member of the [[Australian Labor Party]] in the Upper House of the Western Australian parliament to amend the law.

==Statistics==
Due to the lack of consistent data collection standards across States and the differences in definitions, it is difficult or impossible to accurately quantify the number of abortions performed in Australia each year.&lt;ref name=APL&gt;{{citation|title=How many abortions are there in Australia? A discussion of abortion statistics, their limitations, and options for improved statistical collection |author1=Angela Pratt |author2=Amanda Biggs |author3=Luke Buckmaster |publisher=Parliamentary Library |date=14 February 2005 |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22library%2Fprspub%2FCF7F6%22 |accessdate=1 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202035750/http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p%3Bquery%3DId%3A%22library/prspub/CF7F6%22 |archivedate=2 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were an average of 75,700 [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]]-funded procedures that could result in an "abortive outcome" performed each year from 1995 to 2004, but it should be noted that this figure includes miscarriages as well as terminations. On the other hand, many women who have medical abortions performed at private hospitals may not claim the Medicare rebate.&lt;ref name=APL/&gt;

South Australia is the only state which collects and publishes data on abortions. In 2002 there were 5,147 medical abortions performed in South Australia, or 17.2 per 1000 women aged 15–44. Projected nationally, this would suggest that about 73,300 abortions were performed nationwide. This does not take into account differences between states. For example, unpublished data from Western Australia estimates a rate of 19.4 terminations per 1000 women in the same age bracket, which would indicate about 82,700 abortions projected nationally.&lt;ref name=APL/&gt;

The South Australian data also indicates that the vast majority of abortions performed 1994–2002 occurred before 14 weeks gestation. Less than 2% took place at or after 20 weeks.&lt;ref name=APL/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8848">The '''Declaration of Alma-Ata''' was adopted at the International Conference on [[Primary Health Care]] (PHC), [[Almaty]] (formerly Alma-Ata), [[Kazakhstan]] (formerly [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]]), 6–12 September 1978.&lt;ref name="Alma Ata Declaration"&gt;WHO. [http://www.who.int/publications/almaata_declaration_en.pdf Declaration from the website of the World Health Organization].&lt;/ref&gt; It expressed the need for urgent action by all governments, all health and development workers, and the world community to protect and promote the [[health]] of all people. It was the first international declaration underlining the importance of [[primary health care]]. The primary health care approach has since then been accepted by member countries of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as the key to achieving the goal of "[[Health For All]]" but only in developing countries at first. This applied to all other countries five years later. The Alma-Ata Declaration of 1978 emerged as a major milestone of the twentieth century in the field of public health, and it identified primary health care as the key to the attainment of the goal of '''"Health for All"''' around the globe.

==Description==
The conference called for urgent and effective national and international action to develop and implement primary health care throughout the world and particularly in developing countries in a spirit of technical cooperation and in keeping with a [[New International Economic Order]]. It urged governments, the WHO, [[UNICEF]], and other international organizations, as well as multilateral and  bilateral agencies, non-governmental organizations, funding agencies, all [[health workforce|health workers]] and the world community to support national and international commitment to primary health care and to channel increased technical and financial support to it, particularly in developing countries. The conference called on the aforementioned to collaborate in introducing, developing and maintaining primary health care in accordance with the spirit and content of the declaration. The declaration has 10 points and is non-binding on member states.

===Definition of health===
The first section of the declaration reaffirms the WHO definition of [[health]] as "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of [[disease]] or infirmity".&lt;ref name="WHO definition"&gt;WHO. [http://www.who.int/governance/eb/who_constitution_en.pdf Definition of health from WHO Constitution. The same is reaffirmed by the Alma Ata Declaration] World Health Organization; 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The definition seeks to include social and economic sectors within the scope of attaining health and reaffirms health as a [[human right]].

===Equality===
The declaration highlighted the inequality of health status between the developed and the developing countries and termed it politically, socially and economically unacceptable.

===Health as a socio-economic issue and as a human right===
The third section called for economic and social development as a pre-requisite to the attainment of health for all. It also declared positive effects on economic and social development and on world peace through promotion and protection of the health of the people.

Participation of people as a group or individually in planning and implementing their health care was declared as a human right and duty.

===Role of the state===
This section emphasized on the role of the [[Sovereign state|state]] in providing adequate health and social measures. This section enunciated the call for "[[Health For All]]" which became a campaign of the WHO in the coming years. It defined Health for All as the attainment by all peoples of the world by the year 2000 of a level of health that will permit them to lead a socially and economically productive life. The declaration urged governments, international organizations and the whole world community to take this up as a main social target in the spirit of [[social justice]].

===Primary health care and components===
This section defined [[primary health care]] and urged signatories to incorporate the concept of primary health care in their [[health system]]s. Primary health care has since been adopted by many member nations. More recently, [[Margaret Chan]], the Director-General of the WHO has reaffirmed the primary health care approach as the most efficient and cost-effective way to organize a health system. She also pointed out that international evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that [[health system]]s oriented toward primary health care produce better outcomes, at lower costs, and with higher user satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/dg/speeches/2007/20071101_beijing/en/index.html Keynote address of Dr. Margaret Chan at the International Seminar on Primary Health Care in Rural China in November 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The seventh section lists the components of primary health care. The next two sections called on all governments to incorporate primary health care approach in their health systems and urged international cooperation in better use of the world's resources.

==Criticisms of and reactions to the Alma-Ata Declaration==

The Alma-Ata Declaration generated numerous criticisms and reactions worldwide. Many argued that the slogan "Health for All by 2000" was not possible and that the declaration did not have clear targets. In his article "The Origins of Primary Health Care and Selective Primary Health Care", Marcos Cueto claims that the declaration was condemned as being unrealistic, idealistic, and too broad. As a result of these criticisms, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] sponsored the Health and Population Development Conference held in [[Italy]] at the [[Bellagio Center|Bellagio Conference Center]] in 1979 (a year after Alma-Ata). The purpose of this conference was to specify the goals of PHC and to achieve more effective strategies.

As a result, Selective Primary Health Care (PHC) was introduced. As opposed to PHC of the Alma-Ata Declaration, Selective PHC presented the idea of obtaining low-cost solutions to very specific and common causes of death. The targets and effects of Selective PHC were clear, concise, measurable, and easy to observe. This is because Selective PHC had explicit areas of focus that were believed to be the most important. They were known as GOBI (growth monitoring, [[oral rehydration]] treatment, breastfeeding, and [[immunization]]), and later GOBI-FFF (adding food supplementation, female literacy, and family planning). Unlike the Alma-Ata Declaration, these aspects were very specific and concise, making [[global health]] as successful and attainable as possible. Nonetheless, there were still many supporters who preferred the comprehensive PHC introduced at Alma-Ata over Selective PHC, criticizing the latter as a misrepresentation of some core principles of the original declaration. The main critics are toward selective care as a restrictive approach to health. Therefore, such approach to primary care does not contribute toward integral care (globality) and does not address social determinants as a fundamental aspect of illness and thus essential to health care planning.&lt;ref&gt;Cueto Marcos. 2004. "The Origins of Primary Health Care and Selective Primary Health Care". ''Am J Public Health'' 94 (11): 1864–1874.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global Conference on Primary Health Care==
The World Health Organization, UNICEF and the Government of Kazakhstan co-hosted the Global Conference on Primary Health Care in Astana on 25-26 October, 2018. The conference marked the 40th anniversary of the Alma-Ata Declaration, and united world leaders to affirm that strong primary health care is essential to achieve universal health coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Countries Around the World Just Pledged to Provide Decent Primary Health Care to All Their Citizens |url=https://www.undispatch.com/countries-around-the-world-just-pledged-to-provide-decent-primary-health-care-to-all-their-citizens/ |website=www.undispatch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB)''' is the premier governmental agency responsible for [[sewage]] disposal and water supply to the [[India]]n city of [[Bangalore]]. It was formed in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiagovernance.gov.in/GKC/GKC_WebUI/Portal/TaxonomyShowCase/ShowCaseStudy.aspx?CSID=366&amp;tid=351 "e-Governance in Bangalore Water Supply &amp; Sewerage Board", India Governance Knowledge Center, accessed 11 August 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019014042/http://indiagovernance.gov.in/GKC/GKC_WebUI/Portal/TaxonomyShowCase/ShowCaseStudy.aspx?CSID=366&amp;tid=351 |date=2007-10-19 }}. Note that other sources indicate 1964 as the year of the Board's formation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water supply==
[[File:BWSSB Water Tank at Indiranagar, Hundred Feet Road.JPG|thumb|right|Typical BWSSB water supply tank for the locality.]]
BWSSB currently supplies approximately 900 million liters (238 million gallons) of water to the city per day, despite a municipal demand of 1.3 billion liters. Water for the city (with a population of 10 million) comes from a number of sources, with 80% of it coming from the [[Cauvery River]]. Water is also drawn from the [[Arkavathy River]], but the supply does not meet the demand.&lt;ref name=bwssbfaq&gt;[http://www.bwssb.org/help_faq.html BWSSB website FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818140724/http://bwssb.org/help_faq.html |date=2007-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''per capita'' water supply that BWSSB is able to provide averages 100 to 125 liters per capita per day. However, the actual availability of water to the poor areas of the city is limited by infrastructure, and so for these areas, the ''per capita'' supply can be as low as 40 to 45 liters per day. The ''per capita'' national standard for a city the size of Bangalore is 150 to 200 liters per day,&lt;ref name=bwssbfaq/&gt; From the month of March 2012, water supply in Whitefield has been stopped, with even rich neighborhoods left to fend for themselves.

===Kaveri River project===
The majority of the water for Bangalore is imported by the BWSSB from the Cauvery River, over {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} south of the city.&lt;ref name=tce1&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070320070821/http://www.tce.co.in/infra/watersupply/bangalore.pdf  "Kaveri Water Supply Scheme - Stage IV: Phase I Design Review Report overview", TCE Consulting Engineers Limited, accessed 11 August 2007] {{Dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cauvery water was originally drawn from a reservoir near the village of [[Thorekadanahalli]]. To meet the increasing demand, the "Cauvery Water Supply Scheme" was undertaken by the BWSSB, with Stages I - III completed.&lt;ref name=bwssbfaq/&gt; Stage IV is currently being built, with Phase I completed and bringing an additional 270 million liters to the city.&lt;ref name=bwssbfaq/&gt;&lt;ref name=hindu6&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/06/20/stories/2007062074520400.htm "Cauvery water for new areas soon", ''The Hindu'', 20 June 2007, accessed 11 August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of Stage IV: Phase II is expected to bring an additional 510 million liters, and will be completed by 2010.&lt;ref name=bwssbfaq/&gt;

The energy required to transport the water this distance consumes 75% of the agency's revenues.&lt;ref name=hindu1&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/08/03/stories/2007080360510500.htm "Bangalore team visits RWH structures in city", ''The Hindu'', 3 August 2007, accessed 11 August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arkavathy River===
Up to 20% of the normal water supply for Bangalore comes from the Arkavathy River, from two reservoirs built on the river, the [[Hesaraghatta]] (or Hesseraggatta) which was built in 1894 and the [[Tippagondanahalli Reservoir]] (or T G Halli), which was built in 1933.&lt;ref name=bwssbfaq/&gt;

In June 2007, T G Halli, from which BWSSB pumped 35 million liters per day into the western parts of the city, had effectively gone dry due to lack of rainfall over its watershed. BWSSB officials stated that they would address the issue initially by making water available for only one hour a day, and then by diverting water from other parts of the city, as well as bringing water in by truck.&lt;ref name=deccan2&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Jun272007/city200706279672.asp "It pours, but T G Halli reservoir remains dry", ''Deccan Herald'', 27 June 2007, accessed 11 August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of the water in the reservoir has also become compromised by the discharge of [[effluent]] into the reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kspcb.kar.nic.in/Tippagondanahalli%20Reservoir.doc Government of Karnataka Notification No. FEE 215 ENV 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rainwater harvesting===
To further address water supply issues, BWSSB has studied the [[rainwater harvesting]] (RWH) techniques used in [[Chennai]], where such methods have greatly reduced water shortage issues. RWH methods are becoming mandatory in Bangalore.&lt;ref name=hindu1/&gt; In addition, in April 2007, BWSSB issued a moratorium on new building hookups to the water system.&lt;ref name=hindu2&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/06/03/stories/2007060308500400.htm "Rainwater harvesting is the way forward for Bangalore"],
''The Hindu'' 3 June 2007, accessed 11 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The moratorium was lifted in July, but only on new buildings that have a RWH system installed.&lt;ref name=deccan1&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Jul12007/city2007070110428.asp "Ban on New Water Connection Goes", ''Deccan Herald'', 1 July 2007, accessed 11 August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water rationing===
The BWSSB is also considering implementing a mandatory water rationing program in order to evenly distribute what water supplies exist. A small trial rationing program was instituted in March 2007. Electronic water meters would shut off after the allotted amount of water was used, but the program was considered a technical failure, due in part to software issues.&lt;ref name=hindu4&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/06/27/stories/2007062756150300.htm "Water rationing looms large over Bangalore city", ''The Hindu'', 27 June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water table issues===
Groundwater extraction has caused the [[water table]] to drop variously from 90 to 300 meters (300 to 1000 feet) below ground level (as compared to an average water table depth of about 30 meters (90&amp;nbsp;feet) two decades ago), according to the [[Indian Institute of Science]].&lt;ref name=hindu1/&gt;&lt;ref name=hindu3&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/06/28/stories/2007062860351300.htm "Water access and citizens’ movements", ''The Hindu'', 28 June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation affecting T G Halli are not isolated. Rapid urbanization in and around Bangalore has destroyed many wetlands areas (of the 51 lakes in the city in 1973, only 17 remain in 2007&lt;ref name=hindu3/&gt;), which has also contributed to the decrease in the water table.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

==Sewerage system==
Bangalore's original sewerage system was built in 1922, a time when the city was much smaller than it is today; the original system served only the heart of the city. In 1950, with the city greatly expanding, a project was initiated to greatly expand the sewerage system. After the BWSSB was formed in the 1960s, programs were again implemented to expand the system to not sewer areas. The current sewer system utilizes stoneware pipes up to {{convert|300|mm|in|1}} in diameter, and RCC pipes for the mains and outfalls up to {{convert|2100|mm|in|1}} in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bwssb.org/sewerage_system.html BWSSB Sewerage System overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three main sewage treatment plants, which are located in the Vrishabavathy, [[Koramangala]]-Chellaghatta and [[Hebbal]] valleys. Two additional mini-plants have been built near [[Madiwala]] and Kempambudi.&lt;ref name=bwssbfaq/&gt;

It was Zeff who suggested the name change from ''Well'' to ''Bare'' after watching a [[BBC]] documentary about British architect, John Pawson.

In March 2000, [[Ilse Crawford]] – founder editor of British ''ELLE Decoration'' - was invited as editor of ''Bare'' for a summer launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kirwan-Taylor |first1=Helen |title=At Home With: Ilse Crawford; Diplomacy in Design, Life in One Room |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/15/garden/at-home-with-ilse-crawford-diplomacy-in-design-life-in-one-room.html |accessdate=31 October 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |date=15 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the publication was a bimonthly magazine available on news-stands internationally. The advertising department led by publisher, Honor Riley, formerly of [[Condé Nast]], secured a world first with [[Chanel]] advertising in the launch issue.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Partnerships were garnered with Harvey Nichols and other brands with synergy. The magazine was popular amongst the design aficionado in Belgium and a copy of the Helena Christensen edition made an appearance on the ''[[Sex And The City]]'' episode, [[List of Sex and the City episodes#1.4 Season 4 (2001–02)|''Time and Punishment'']].

The magazine has been described as "speak[ing] the earnest psychobabble of the Hampstead eco-hypochondriac".&lt;ref name=hodgson /&gt;

==Genetics==
Blue cone monochromacy is inherited from the [[X chromosome#Humans|X chromosome]].&lt;ref name="KOHL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LEWIS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ALPERN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NEITZX" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SPIVEY1965"/&gt;

The genes involved in the BCM are on chromosome X, at [[Locus (genetics)|position]] Xq28,&lt;ref name="ALPERN" /&gt; at the end of the q arm of the X chromosome. The genes’ names are:

Other mutations on genes OPN1LW and OPN1MW that lead to the blue cone monochromacy are constituted by a set of point mutations called for example LIAVA.&lt;ref name="NEITZ2-COL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GARDNER2014" /&gt; Blue cone monochromacy will be caused by the production of new hybrid gene, like in the previous case, from the homologous recombination of OPN1LW and OPN1MW. Exon 3 of the hybrid gene contains the following amino acids in the positions indicated: 153 [[Leucine]], 171 [[Isoleucine]], 174 [[Alanine]], 178 [[Valine]] and 180 [[Alanine]]. This [[genotype]] has the abbreviated name LIAVA.&lt;ref name="NEITZ2-COL"/&gt;

Another disease of the retina that is associated with the position Xq28 is Bornholm Eye Disease (BED).&lt;ref name="NEITZ2-COL"/&gt;

Finally note there is also a particular mutation of the two genes OPN1LW and OPN1MW which causes a different disease from the blue cone monochromacy. This type of mutation is named W177R and is a [[misfolding]] mutation that, if present on both [[opsin]] genes cause [[cone dystrophy]] with evidence of degeneration and cell death of the cones.&lt;ref name="GARDNER2010"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
In a male child, from 2 months upwards, an aversion to light and [[nystagmus]]&lt;ref name="ALPERN1960"/&gt; may lead to the suspicion of a case of blue cone monochromacy, but it does not provide sufficient indications to establish the form of the condition. To identify a case of blue cone monochromacy, it is necessary to reconstruct the family history&lt;ref name="LEWIS" /&gt;
,&lt;ref name="KOHL"/&gt; with the condition linked to the transmission of the [[X chromosome#Humans|X chromosome]], if there are other cases in the family.&lt;ref name="NATHA_BCM2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SIEV2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JACOBSON1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MICHAEL2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GARDNER2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WISSINGER" /&gt;

The [[Electroretinography|electroretinogram (ERG)]], can demonstrate the loss of cone function with retained [[Rod cell|rod]] function.&lt;ref name="ANDREASS"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andréasson|first1=S|last2=Tornqvist|first2=K|title=Electroretinograms in patients with achromatopsia|journal=Acta Ophthalmol (Copenh)|date=1991|volume=69|issue=6|pages=711–716|pmid=1789084}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SIEV1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BANIN" /&gt;

Visual acuity is usually tested in adults and is between 20/60 and 20/200.&lt;ref name="JACOBSON1" /&gt;

==Treatment==
There is no cure for blue cone monochromacy; however, the efficacy and safety of various prospective treatments are currently being evaluated. [[Gene therapy]] is actually the most promising one.&lt;ref name="JACOBSON1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JACOBSON2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luo|first1=X|last2=Cideciyan|first2=AV|last3=Iannaccone|first3=A|last4=Roman|first4=A J|last5=Ditta|first5=L C|last6=Jennings|first6=B J|last7=Yatsenko|first7=S|last8=Sheplock|first8=R|last9=Sumaroka|first9=A|last10=Swider|first10=M|last11=Schwartz|first11=S B|last12=Wissinger|first12=B|last13=Kohl|first13=S|last14=Jacobson|first14=S G|title=Blue Cone Monochromacy: visual function and efficacy outcome measures for clinical trials|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2015|volume=10|issue=4|pmid=25909963|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0125700|pmc=4409040|page=e0125700}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of gene therapy&lt;ref name="HAUSWIRTH2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Y|last2=Deng|first2=WT |last3=Du|first3=W|last4=Zhu|first4=P|last5=Li|first5=J|last6=Xu|first6=F |last7=Sun|first7=J |last8=Gerstner|first8=C D|last9=Baehr|first9=W|last10=Boye Sanford|first10=L |last11=Zhao|first11=C |last12=Hauswirth|first12=W W|last13=Pang|first13=J |title=Gene-based Therapy in a Mouse Model of Blue Cone Monochromacy|journal=Scientific Reports|date=2017|volume=7|issue=6690|pmid=28751656 |doi=10.1038/s41598-017-06982-7 |pmc=5532293}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies is to virally supplement retinal cells expressing mutant genes associated with the blue cone mMonochromacy phenotype with healthy forms of the gene; thus, allowing the repair and proper functioning of retinal photoreceptor cells in response to the instructions associated with the inserted healthy gene.
 
Corrective visual aides and personalized vision therapy provided by Low Vision Specialists may help patients correct glare and optimize their remaining visual acuity. Tinted lenses for photophobia allow for greater visual comfort.  A magenta (mixture of red and blue) tint allows for best visual acuity since it protects the rods from saturation while allowing the blue cones to be maximally stimulated.

==Epidemiology==
BCM is a cause of inherited low vision&lt;ref name="JACOBSON1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JACOBSON2" /&gt; with approximately 1/100,000 individuals experiencing the disease within their lifetime.&lt;ref name="KOHL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GARDNER2009" /&gt;
The disease affects male recipients of the X-linked mutation, while females usually remain unaffected carriers of the BCM trait.&lt;ref name="LEWIS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ALPERN"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="NEITZX"/&gt;

==History==
The disease is known since many years. The first detailed description of blue cone monochromacy is that given by Huddart (1777).&lt;ref name="HUD1777"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huddart|first1=J|title=An account of persons who could not distinguish colours|journal=Philos.

High-resolution imaging of the cone mosaic in the living human eye using [[Adaptive optics#In retinal imaging|Adaptive Optics]] has made it possible to address the question of how different genetic rearrangements affect the retinal phenotype at the cellular level.
Cone Mosaic studies performed with [[Adaptive optics#In retinal imaging|Adaptive Optics]] technology revealed a disrutpion of the normal pattern of photoreceptors human cone mosaic in presence of the most frequent causative blue cone monochromacy genetic mutations. [[Adaptive optics#In retinal imaging|Adaptive optics]] images show that the number of visible cones was significantly reduced and the regularity of the cone mosaic was disrupted compared to normals.

Only in the last few years, blue cone monochromacy has been studied with the aim to find a treatment.&lt;ref name="JACOBSON1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JACOBSON2" /&gt;

Future treatments may involve gene therapy.&lt;ref name="JACOBSON1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JACOBSON2" /&gt; In fact it seems that in case of a genetic deletion of the human cone visual pigment there is a sufficient number of photoreceptors  to warrant Gene Therapy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12430">In [[population ecology]], '''density-dependent''' processes occur when [[population growth rate|population growth rates]] are regulated by the density of a [[population]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hixon|first=M|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|place=Chichester|doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0021219|chapter=Density Dependence and Independence|title=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences|isbn=0470016175}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article will focus on density-dependence in the context of [[macroparasite]] life cycles.

==Positive density-dependence==
'''Positive density-dependence''', '''density-dependent facilitation''', or the '''[[Allee effect]]''' describes a situation in which [[population growth]] is facilitated by increased population density.

===Examples===
For [[Dioecy|dioecious]] (separate sex) obligatory parasites, mated female worms are required to complete a transmission cycle. At low parasite densities, the probability of a female worm encountering a male worm and forming a mating pair can become so low that reproduction is restricted due to single sex infections. At higher parasite densities, the probability of mating pairs forming and successful reproduction increases. This has been observed in the population dynamics of [[Schistosoma|''Schistosomes'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=May|first= R.M.|title=Togetherness among Schistosomes: its effects on the dynamics of the infection|journal=Mathematical Biosciences|year=1977|volume=35 |issue=3–4|pages=301–343|doi=10.1016/0025-5564(77)90030-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive density-dependence processes occur in [[macroparasite]] life cycles that rely on [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] with a cibarial armature, such as ''[[Anopheles]]'' or ''[[Culex]]'' mosquitoes. For ''[[Wuchereria bancrofti]]'', a filarial nematode, well-developed cibarial armatures in vectors can damage ingested [[microfilaria]]e and impede the development of infective L3 [[larva]]e. At low microfilariae densities, most microfilariae can be ruptured by teeth, preventing successful development of infective L3 larvae. As more larvae are ingested, the ones that become entangled in the teeth may protect the remaining larvae, which are then left undamaged during ingestion.&lt;ref name="Snow2006"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snow|first=L.C.|title= Transmission dynamics of lymphatic filariasis: vector-specific density dependence in the development of Wuchereria bancrofti infective larvae in mosquitoes|journal=Medical and Veterinary Entomology|year=2006|volume=20|issue=3|pages=261–272|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2915.2006.00629.x|pmid=17044876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive density-dependence processes may also occur in macroparasite infections that lead to [[immunosuppression]]. ''[[Onchocerca volvulus]]'' infection promotes immunosuppressive processes within the human host that suppress immunity against incoming infective L3 larvae. This suppression of anti-parasite immunity causes parasite establishment rates to increase with higher parasite burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duerr|first=H.P.|title=Density-dependent parasite establishment suggests infection-associated immunosuppression as an important mechanism for parasite density regulation in onchocerciasis|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2003|volume=97|issue=2|pages=242–250|doi=10.1016/S0035-9203(03)90132-5|pmid=14584385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative density-dependence==
'''Negative density-dependence''', or '''density-dependent restriction''', describes a situation in which [[population growth]] is curtailed by crowding, predators and competition. In [[cell biology]], it describes the reduction in [[Cell (biology)|cell]] division. When a cell [[population]] reaches a certain density, the amount of required [[growth factor]]s and [[nutrient]]s available to each cell becomes insufficient to allow continued [[cell growth]].

This is also true for other organisms because an increased density means an increase in [[intraspecific competition]]. Greater competition means an individual has a decreased contribution to the next generation i.e. offspring. 
Density-dependent mortality can be overcompensating, undercompensating or exactly compensating. 

There also exists '''density-independent inhibition''', where other factors such as [[weather]] or environmental conditions and [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbances]] may affect a population's [[carrying capacity]].

An example of a density-dependent variable is crowding and competition.

===Examples===
[[File:Generalized fecundity graph.png|thumb|250px|right|Density-dependent fecundity]] Density-dependent [[fecundity]] exists, where the birth rate falls as competition increases. In the context of gastrointestinal nematodes, the weight of female ''[[Ascaris lumbricoides]]'' and its rates of egg production decrease as host infection intensity increases. Thus, the per-capita contribution of each worm to transmission decreases as a function of infection intensity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=M|title=Density-dependent effects on the weight of female Ascaris lumbricoides infections of humans and its impact on patterns of egg production|journal=Parasites and Vectors|year=2009|volume=2|issue=1|pages=11|doi=10.1186/1756-3305-2-11|pmid=19208229|pmc=2672930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blackfly life expectancy.png|thumb|250px|right|Parasite-induced vector mortality]] Parasite-induced vector mortality is a form of negative density-dependence. The ''[[Onchocerciasis]]'' life cycle involves transmission via a [[black fly]] vector. In this life-cycle, the life expectancy of the black fly vector decreases as the worm load ingested by the vector increases. Because ''[[Onchocerciasis|O. volvulus]]'' [[microfilariae]] require at least seven days to mature into infective L3 larvae in the black fly, the worm load is restricted to levels that allow the black fly to survive for long enough to pass infective L3 larvae onto humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Basanez|first=M.G.|title=Density-dependent processes in the onchocerciasis: relationship between microfilarial intake and mortality of the simuliid vector|journal=Parasitology|year=1996|volume=113|issue=4|pages=331–355|publisher=Cambridge University Press|doi=10.1017/S003118200006649X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In macroparasite life cycles==
[[File:Density-dependence in filariasis.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Density-dependence processes (red) in filariasis life cycle]] In [[macroparasite]] life cycles, density-dependent processes can influence parasite fecundity, survival, and establishment. Density-dependent processes can act across multiple points of the macroparasite life cycle. For [[Filariasis|filarial worms]], density-dependent processes can act at the host/vector interface or within the host/vector life-cycle stages. At the host/vector interface, density-dependence may influence the input of L3 larvae into the host’s skin and the ingestion of microfilariae by the vector. Within the life-cycle stages taking place in the vector, density-dependence may influence the development of L3 larvae in vectors and vector life expectancy. Within the life-cycle stages taking place in the host, density-dependence may influence the development of microfilariae and host life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Churcher-2006"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Density dependence and the control of helminth parasites | last=Churcher | first=T.S. | journal=Journal of Animal Ecology | year=2006 | volume=75 | issue=6 | pages=1313–1320 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2656.2006.01154.x| pmid=17032363 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, combinations of [[#Negative density-dependence|negative (restriction)]] and [[#Positive density-dependence|positive (facilitation)]] density-dependent processes occur in the life cycles of parasites. However, the extent to which one process predominates over the other vary widely according to the parasite, vector, and host involved. This is illustrated by the ''[[Wuchereria bancrofti|W. bancrofti]]'' life cycle. In ''[[Culex]]'' mosquitoes, which lack a well-developed cibarial armature, [[#Negative density-dependence|restriction]] processes predominate. Thus, the number of L3 larvae per mosquito declines as the number of ingested microfilariae increases. Conversely, in ''[[Aedes]]'' and ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquitoes, which have well-developed cibarial armatures, [[#Positive density-dependence|facilitation]] processes predominate. Consequently, the number of L3 larvae per mosquito increases as the number of ingested [[microfilariae]] increases.&lt;ref name="Snow2006"/&gt;

==Implications for parasite persistence and control==
[[#Negative density-dependence|Negative density-dependent (restriction)]] processes contribute to the resilience of macroparasite populations. At high parasite populations, [[#Negative density-dependence|restriction]] processes tend to restrict population growth rates and contribute to the stability of these populations. Interventions that lead to a reduction in parasite populations will cause a relaxation of density-dependent [[#Negative density-dependence|restrictions]], increasing per-capita rates of reproduction or survival, thereby contributing to population persistence and resilience.&lt;ref name="Churcher-2006" /&gt;

Contrariwise, positive density-dependent or facilitation processes make elimination of a parasite population more likely. Facilitation processes cause the reproductive success of the parasite to decrease with lower worm burden.  Thus, control measures that reduce parasite burden will automatically reduce per-capita reproductive success and increase the likelihood of elimination when facilitation processes predominate.&lt;ref name="Duerr-2005"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Determinants of the eradicability of filarial infections: a conceptual approach | last=Duerr | first=H.P. | journal=Trends in Parasitology | year=2005 | volume=21 | issue=2 | pages=88–96 | doi=10.1016/j.pt.2004.11.011| pmid=15664532 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extinction threshold===
The '''[[extinction threshold]]''' refers to minimum parasite density level for the parasite to persist in a population. Interventions that reduce parasite density to a level below this threshold will ultimately lead to the extinction of that parasite in that population. [[#Positive density-dependence|Facilitation]] processes increase the extinction threshold, making it easier to achieve using parasite control interventions. Conversely, [[#Negative density-dependence|restriction]] processes complicates control measures by decreasing the extinction threshold.&lt;ref name="Duerr-2005" /&gt;

==Implications for parasite distribution==
Anderson and Gordon (1982) propose that the distribution of macroparasites in a host population is regulated by a combination of positive and negative density-dependent processes. In overdispersed distributions, a small proportion of hosts harbour most of the parasite population. Positive density-dependent processes contribute to [[overdispersion]] of parasite populations, whereas negative density-dependent processes contribute to [[underdispersion]] of parasite populations. As mean parasite burden increases, negative density-dependent processes become more prominent and the distribution of the parasite population tends to become less overdispersed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=R.M.|title=Processes influencing the distribution of parasite numbers within host populations with special emphasis on parasite-induced host mortalities|journal=Parasitology|year=1982|volume=85|issue=2|pages=373–398|doi=10.1017/S0031182000055347 | pmid=7145478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, interventions that lead to a reduction in parasite burden will tend to cause the parasite distribution to become overdispersed. For instance, time-series data for ''[[Onchocerciasis]]'' infection demonstrates that 10 years of vector control lead to reduced parasite burden with a more overdispersed distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Plaisier|first=A.P.|title=Modelling Onchocerciasis Transmission and Control|year=1996|publisher=Erasmus University|location=Rotterdam|isbn=90-72245-68-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EMS has received an increasing amount of attention in the last few years for many reasons: it can be utilized as a strength training tool for healthy subjects and athletes; it could be used as a rehabilitation and preventive tool for partially or totally immobilized patients; it could be utilized as a testing tool for evaluating the neural and/or muscular function in vivo; it could be used as a post-exercise recovery tool for athletes.&lt;ref name="ISEK2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00421-011-2133-7 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00421-011-2133-7 |title=Electrical stimulation for neuromuscular testing and training: State-of-the art and unresolved issues |year=2011 |last1=Maffiuletti |first1=Nicola A. |last2=Minetto |first2=Marco A. |last3=Farina |first3=Dario |last4=Bottinelli |first4=Roberto |journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=111 |issue=10 |pages=2391–7 |pmid=21866361}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impulses are generated by a device and are delivered through electrodes on the skin near to the muscles being stimulated. The electrodes are generally pads that adhere to the skin. The impulses mimic the [[action potential]] that comes from the [[central nervous system]], causing the muscles to contract.

===Physical Therapy===
In medicine, EMS is used for rehabilitation purposes, for instance in [[physical therapy]] in the prevention of disuse muscle atrophy which can occur for example after [[Musculoskeletal injury|musculoskeletal injuries]], such as damage to bones, joints, muscles, ligaments and tendons. This is distinct from [[transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]] (TENS), in which an electric current is used for pain therapy.

In EMS training few muscular groups are targeted at the same time, for specific training goals.&lt;ref name="Vrbova2008"/&gt;

===Weight loss===
The FDA rejects certification of devices that claim weight reduction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_240.html FDA Import Alert 10/02/2009 ''Electrical Muscle Stimulators and Iontophoresis Devices''] Muscle stimulators are misbranded when any of the following claims are made: girth reduction, loss of inches, weight reduction, cellulite removal, bust development, body shaping and contouring, and spot reducing.&lt;/ref&gt; EMS devices cause a calorie burning that is marginal at best: calories are burnt in significant amount only when most of the body is involved in physical exercise: several muscles, the heart and the respiratory system are all engaged at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19124897 |year=2006 |last1=Maffiuletti |first1=NA |title=The use of electrostimulation exercise in competitive sport |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=406–7 |journal=International journal of sports physiology and performance}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some authors imply that EMS can lead to exercise, since people toning their muscles with electrical stimulation are more likely afterwards
to participate in sporting activities as the body becomes ready, fit, willing and able to take on physical activity.&lt;ref name="Vrbova2008"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Springer| last = Vrbova| first = Gerta|author2=Olga Hudlicka |author3=Kristin Schaefer Centofanti | title = Application of Muscle-Nerve Stimulation in Health and Disease| year = 2008| pages = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects ===
"Strength training by NMES does promote neural and muscular adaptations that are complementary to the well-known effects of voluntary resistance training".&lt;ref name="ISEK2010"/&gt; This statement is part of the editorial summary of a 2010 world congress of researchers on the subject. Additional studies on practical applications, which came after that congress, pointed out important factors that make the difference between effective and ineffective EMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31823f2cd1| issn = 1533-4287| volume = 26| issue = 9| pages = 2600–2614| last = Filipovic| first = Andre|author2=Heinz Kleinöder |author3=Ulrike Dörmann |author4=Joachim Mester | title = Electromyostimulation--a systematic review of the effects of different electromyostimulation methods on selected strength parameters in trained and elite athletes| journal = Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength &amp; Conditioning Association| date = September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Also, as published by reputable universities, EMS causes adaptation, i.e. training, of muscle fibers.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from ''National Skeletal Muscle Research Center''; UCSD, [http://muscle.ucsd.edu/musintro/es.shtml Muscle Physiology Home Page - Electrical Stimulation]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the characteristics of [[skeletal muscle]] fibers, different types of fibers can be activated to differing degrees by different types of EMS, and the modifications induced depend on the pattern of EMS activity.&lt;ref name="Pmid" /&gt; These patterns, referred to as protocols or programs, will cause a different response from contraction of different fiber types. Some programs will improve fatigue resistance, i.e. endurance, others will increase force production.&lt;ref name=Pette99/&gt;

== History ==
[[Luigi Galvani]] (1761) provided the first scientific evidence that current can activate muscle. During the 19th and 20th centuries, researchers studied and documented the exact electrical properties that generate muscle movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ranvier |first=Louis-Antoine |year=1874 |title=De quelques faits relatifs à l'histologie et à la physiologie des muscles striés |language=French |journal=Archives de Physiologie Normale et Pathologique |volume=6 |pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1929RSPSB.104..252D |title=On the Nature of Postural Reflexes |author1=Denny-Brown |first1=D. |volume=104 |year=1929 |pages=252–301 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |doi=10.1098/rspb.1929.0010 |issue=730 |jstor=81340}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered that the body functions induced by electrical stimulation caused long-term changes in the muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=13805874 |year=1960 |last1=Buller |first1=AJ |last2=Eccles |first2=JC |last3=Eccles |first3=RM |title=Interactions between motoneurones and muscles in respect of the characteristic speeds of their responses |volume=150 |pages=417–39 |pmc=1363172 |journal=The Journal of Physiology |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1960.sp006395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00587391 |title=Effects of long-term electrical stimulation on some contractile and metabolic characteristics of fast rabbit muscles |year=1973 |last1=Pette |first1=Dirk |last2=Smith |first2=Margaret E. |last3=Staudte |first3=Hans W. |last4=Vrbová |first4=Gerta |journal=Pflügers Archiv: European Journal of Physiology |volume=338 |issue=3 |pages=257–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, Soviet sport scientists applied EMS in the training of elite athletes, claiming 40% force gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12350217 |year=2002 |last1=Ward |first1=AR |last2=Shkuratova |first2=N |title=Russian electrical stimulation: The early experiments |volume=82 |issue=10 |pages=1019–30 |journal=Physical therapy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, these studies were shared during conferences with the Western sport establishments.

==Society and culture==
=== United States regulation ===
The  [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) certifies and releases EMS devices into two broad categories: over-the counter devices (OTC), and prescription devices. OTC devices are marketable only for muscle toning; prescription devices can be purchased only with a medical prescription for therapy. Prescription devices should be used under supervision of an authorized practitioner, for the following uses:
* Relaxation of muscle spasms;
* Prevention or retardation of disuse atrophy;
* Increasing local blood circulation;
* Muscle re-education;
* Immediate post-surgical stimulation of calf muscles to prevent [[venous thrombosis]];
* Maintaining or increasing range of motion.
The FDA mandates that manuals prominently display contraindication, warnings, precautions and adverse reactions, including: no use for wearer of pacemaker; no use on vital parts, such as carotid sinus nerves, across the chest, or across the brain; caution in the use during pregnancy, menstruation, and other particular conditions that may be affected by muscle contractions; potential adverse effects include skin irritations and burns

Only FDA-certified devices can be lawfully sold in the US without medical prescription. These can be found at the corresponding FDA webpage for certified devices.&lt;ref name="FDA-Certified Devices"&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/pmn.cfm?start_search=1&amp;ProductCode=ngx&amp;KNumber=K&amp;ThirdPartyReviewed=off&amp;IVDProducts=off FDA-Certified Devices]&lt;/ref&gt; The FTC has cracked down on consumer EMS devices that made unsubstantiated claims;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2002/05/projectabsurd.htm FTC Charges Three Top-selling Electronic Abdominal Exercise Belts with Making False Claims]&lt;/ref&gt; many have been removed from the market, some have obtained FDA certification.

From the 1950s, the company marketed the device for use in weight loss and fitness.  [[Electrode]]s from the device were attached to the skin and caused [[muscle contraction]]s by way of [[Electric current|electrical currents]].&lt;ref name="gizmodo-2015" /&gt; The device caused 40 muscular contractions per minute in the muscles affected by the motor nerve points in the area of each pad. The directions for use recommended use of the device at least 30 minutes daily for each figure placement area, and suggested that the user might use it for longer periods if they wished. The device was offered in a number of different models which were powered either by battery or household current.&lt;ref name=USVR/&gt;

Relax-A-Cizors had from 1 to 6 channels. Two pads (or electrodes) were connected by wires to each channel. The user applied from 2 to 12 pads to various parts of their body. For each channel there was a dial which purported to control the intensity of the electrical current flowing into the user's body between the two pads connected to that channel.&lt;ref name=USVR/&gt;

As of 1970, the device was manufactured in Chicago, Illinois, by Eastwood Industries, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Relaxacizor, Inc., and was then distributed throughout the country at the direction of Relaxacizor, Inc., or Relaxacizor Sales, Inc.&lt;ref name=USVR/&gt;

The device was banned by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] in 1970 as it was deemed to be potentially unhealthy and dangerous to the users.&lt;ref name="gizmodo-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name=USVR&gt;{{cite web |url= https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3239332033316792191&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr |title=United States v. Relaxacizor, Inc., 340 F. Supp. 943 - Dist. Court, CD California 1970 |work= Google Scholar |accessdate= 2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case went to court, and the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] held that the Relax-A-Cizor was a "device" within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. § 321 (h) because it was intended to affect the structure and functions of the body as a girth reducer and exerciser, and upheld the FDA's assertions that the device was potentially hazardous to health.&lt;ref name=USVR/&gt;

The FDA informed owners of Relax-A-Cizors that second-hand sale of Relax-A-Cizors was illegal, and recommended that they should destroy the devices or render them inoperable.&lt;ref name=quackery/&gt;

Slendertone is another brand name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704779704574553790579199098|title=Cinching Your Belt Without a Crunch|last=Johannes|first=Laura|date=2009-11-25|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2015}} the company's Slendertone Flex product had been approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] for over-the-counter sale for toning, strengthening and firming abdominal muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/HomeHealthandConsumer/ConsumerProducts/ucm142478.htm|title=Electronic Muscle Stimulators|last=|first=|date=2015-03-25|website=www.fda.gov|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9029">'''Emotional competence''' refers to one's ability to [[emotional expression|express]] or release one's inner feelings ([[emotion]]s). It implies an ease around others and determines one's ability to effectively and successfully lead and express.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Air War College |title=Emotional Competence and Leadership |date=2000-09-21 |publisher=Air War College |url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/uscg/emot.htm |accessdate=2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is described as the essential [[social skills]] to recognize, interpret, and respond constructively to emotions in yourself and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Leland R.

==Description==
{{Original research section|date=March 2009}}
The concept of emotional competence is rooted in understanding emotions as normal, useful aspects of being human. [[Anger]] is a reaction to aggression and gives a person the strength to repel the aggression. Though anger is usually seen in a negative light, sometimes it can also serve the purpose of protection. Grief is a reaction to abandonment or feeling unloved and it has the effect of eliciting sympathetic responses from others. Fear is a response to danger and has a clear physiological effect of heightening our senses and speeding up our reactions.

From this it can be seen that the suppression of emotion can be useful to avoid injury, [[embarrassment]] and arrest, but teaching people to suppress their inappropriate emotions is part of normal society.  Suppressing other people's emotions to avoid conflict or discomfort in oneself can lead to controlling them, which may be unhealthy for all concerned. Emotionally competent people do express emotions appropriate to the situation, to their needs and to others, and they attempt not to suppress appropriate emotions, reactions and communications of feelings by others.

Some psychologists believe that if appropriate emotions are not expressed on a regular basis, a misplaced or unresolved memory of them becomes stored.  Alternatively, this may also lead to an inability to process emotional clues in others, or have emotionally appropriate behaviors in oneself.  Events in the future may trigger old emotions resulting in inappropriate emotional responses, or may trigger nothing, leaving one with a lack of emotional competence. This often applies to emotions that children may be experiencing, or are prevented from expressing, when an adult simply wishes to avoid dealing with feelings that may be very real to the child, who has yet to learn that feelings and facts are not mutually exclusive, or that emotionalism can be misunderstood or misused. Releasing childhood emotions, or pent up adult emotions can be a useful tool in [[co-counselling]].

Emotional competence can lead to improved health through avoiding stress that would otherwise result from suppressing emotions. It can also lead to improved relationships since inappropriate emotions are less likely to be expressed and appropriate behaviour is not avoided through fear of triggering some emotion. It can be seen in an economics of human resource as a real capital.

==Emotional capital==

Quoted in her work in 2002, Prof. Dr. Benedicte Gendron defined the concept of '''emotional capital''' as the set of personal and social emotional competencies which constitute a resource inherent to the person, useful for the personal, professional and organizational development and takes part in social cohesion, to personal, social and economic success" (Gendron, 2004, 2006).
"Furthermore, because of its impact on performance (at school as at work and for the organizations), on well-being ([[life satisfaction]], health...) and on social cohesion and citizenship, emotional capital should be taken into account seriously by public and educational policy-makers and practicians and companies."
"To end, emotional capital is the set (resource) of emotional competencies which gives individuals and organizations the ability to use emotions to help individuals at solving problems and living a more effective life and the organization at facing economics and social changes and being successful and surviving in the new economics world. Emotional capital without capital (physical, human, social and cultural), or capital without emotional capital, is only part of a solution. With it, it is the head working with the heart and the hands. All of the three H need to be combined... taking into account the three H of each individual: Hands, Head and Heart." (Gendron, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;31).
The concept is derived from the [[emotional intelligence]] work which looks at self-awareness, self-regulation, social awareness and social regulation as essential competencies helpful at coping stress regulation and using emotions in a positive way.

==Assertiveness==
{{Main article|Assertiveness}}
Humanistic approaches to assertiveness, as, for instance, outlined by Anne Dickson emphasise the importance of working with emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dickson |first=Anne |title=A Woman in Your Own Right |publisher=Quartet Books |date=1982 |isbn=0-7043-3420-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular it recognises the need to address manipulative or passive (the person does not say what they want) – aggressive (they try to force the other person to do what they want) behaviour in which the manipulator exploits the feelings of the other to try to get what they want. Building up emotional competence is a way of learning to handle such behaviour.

Another aspect is learning to be assertive when feeling emotional. Assertiveness training involves learning a range of ways to handle any situation so that a person is able to choose a way which seems appropriate for them on each occasion. With respect to emotions, people are encouraged to notice and accept what they feel. They then have choices from handling the situation calmly through doing so and saying how they feel to letting the emotion out, all of which involve emotional competence.

This also would encompass the realm of where the emotionally competent response would have judicial consequences, e.g. [[competence (law)|competence under the law]].

Some researchers feel the role of emotion has been neglected, both in traditional accounts of decision-making and in assessments of adjudicative competence, and further attention and study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Emotional Competence, Rational Understanding, and the Criminal Defendant |journal=  |first=Terry |last=Maroney |ssrn=892474 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13102">'''Eric Stover''' is an American [[human rights]] researcher and advocate and faculty director of the Human Rights Center at the [[University of California at Berkeley]].

== Career ==

Stover officially began his human rights work as a researcher at [[Amnesty International]] in London, England from 1977-1980. During this time, the organization won the Nobel Peace Prize for its “campaign against torture,” and the [[United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights]]. Following Amnesty International, Stover became the Director of the Science and Human Rights Program of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]. In 1992, Stover served as the Executive Director of [[Physicians for Human Rights]] where he worked on forensic missions to examine mass gravesites for the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalpolicy.org/international-justice/international-criminal-tribunals-and-special-courts/international-criminal-tribunal-for-yugoslavia.html|title=International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia|author=James Paul - Global Policy Forum|work=globalpolicy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rwanda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalpolicy.org/international-justice/international-criminal-tribunals-and-special-courts/international-criminal-tribunal-for-rwanda.html|title=International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda|author=Administrator|work=globalpolicy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/about/programs/open-society-fellowship/grantees/eric-stover ''opensocietyfoundations.org''&lt;/ref&gt; While at PHR, Stover performed research on the sociomedical consequences of land mines in war-torn countries such as Cambodia. His research helped launch the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]], which, along with the organization’s director, Jody Williams, received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="nobelprize.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1977/|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1977|work=nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has published seven books and numerous reports and articles for press and scholarly publications.

=== Human Rights Center ===

Stover became the Faculty Director of the Human Rights Center (HRC) at the [[UC Berkeley School of Law]] in 1996, two years after the center was established.

The HRC is an interdisciplinary research center which uses science and law to pursue human rights issues. 
The Human Rights center has conducted investigations or research focusing on [[sexual violence]], [[human trafficking]], [[torture]], public health among vulnerable populations, accountability for war criminals, [[child soldiers]], [[family reunification]], and the applications of advanced technologies to human rights work. The Center's reports have examined human rights issues in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], [[Central America]] and [[South America]], [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Balkans]], the [[Middle East]], and the [[United States]]. In February, 2015, the Human Rights Center was awarded a grant from the MacArthur foundation's program for Creative and Effective Institutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/UC-Berkeley-Human-Rights-Center-wins-1-million-6062846.php&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erotic lactation''' is [[sexual arousal]] by [[breastfeeding]] on a woman's breast.  Depending on the context, the practice can also be referred to as adult suckling, adult nursing, and adult breastfeeding.  Practitioners sometimes refer to themselves as being in an '''adult nursing relationship''' ('''ANR''').&lt;ref name="forth133-136"&gt;(Forth ''et al.'' 2006, pp. 133–136)&lt;/ref&gt; Two persons in an exclusive relationship can be called a nursing couple.

"Milk fetishism" and "lactophilia" are medical, diagnostic terms for [[paraphilia|paraphilias]] and are used for disorders according to the precise criteria of [[ICD|ICD-10]] and [[DSM-IV]].&lt;ref&gt;Schöbl, Roland (2007). ''Erotische Laktation'', Denkholz Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiology ==
Breasts, and especially nipples, are highly [[erogenous zone]]s, for both men and women. Nipple and breast stimulation of women are a near-universal aspect of [[human sexuality]], though nipples in males are not as sexualized.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;  Humans are the only primates whose female members have permanently enlarged breasts after the onset of puberty; the breasts of other primate species are enlarged only during pregnancy and nursing. One hypothesis postulates that the breasts grew as a frontal counterpart to the buttocks as primates became upright to attracting mates, a model first developed in 1967.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt; Other hypotheses include that by chance breasts act as a cushion for infant heads, are a signal of fertility, or elevate the infant's head in breastfeeding to prevent suffocation.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;  Paradoxically, there is even a school that believes that they are an [[evolutionary flaw]], and can actually suffocate a nursing infant.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;
The association of pleasure and nutrition holds true as well for the lips, also erogenous zones, where pleasure may have led to "[[kiss feeding]]", in which mothers chew food before passing it on to the child.{{efn|name=kiss feeding}}

Unintended milk flow ([[galactorrhea]]) is often caused by nipple stimulation and it is possible to reach normal milk production exclusively by suckling on the breast.  Nipple stimulation of any sort is noted in reducing the incidence of breast cancer.&lt;ref name=levin&gt;Levin, Roy J. (May 2006), "The breast/nipple/areola complex and human sexuality". ''Sexual &amp; Relationship Therapy''. '''21''' (2):237–249&lt;/ref&gt;

Some women lose the ability to be aroused while breastfeeding, and thus would not find lactation with a sexual partner to be erotic.  This can be a result of physical reasons (soreness) or psychological reasons (conflicted about her breasts being used other than for an infant).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Mindy A. (2000), ''20 Common Problems in Women's Health Care''. McGraw-Hill Professional, {{ISBN|0-07-069767-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivations ==
Because female breasts and nipples are generally regarded as an important part of sexual activity in most cultures, &lt;!-- ethnic ones, for instance; like ''Islamic law'' suggests. --&gt; it is not uncommon that couples may proceed from oral stimulation of the nipples to actual breastfeeding.&lt;ref name=BP133&gt;(Forth et al, p 133)&lt;/ref&gt; In lesbian partnerships, mutual breastfeeding has been regarded as a familiar expression of affection and tenderness.&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Sexual Research, Vienna 1928–1932: Universallexikon der Sittengeschichte und Sexualwissenschaft (''Universal encyclopedia of moral history and sexual science''). Digital available as CD ROM "Bilderlexikon der Erotik", Digitale Bibliothek, Berlin/Germany 2004, volume 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its issue of March 13, 2005, the London weekly ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' gave a report of a scientific survey (composed of 1690 British men) revealing that in 25 to 33% of all couples, the male partner had [[Nipple sucking|suckled]] his wife's breasts. Regularly, the men gave a genuine emotional need as their motive.&lt;ref name=times&gt;Rogers, Lois (March 13, 2005), [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article426518.ece "Earth dads give breast milk a try"]. ''The Sunday Times''. Retrieved on 2008-01-14&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social implications ==
The breasts have two main roles in human society: nutritive and sexual.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;  Breastfeeding in general is considered by some to be mildly exhibitionary, especially in Western societies (see [[breastfeeding in public]]).  Breastfeeding mothers have faced legal ramifications for nursing their children into toddlerhood or in public, or for photographing themselves while nursing.&lt;ref name=giles&gt;Giles, Fiona (November 2004), "'Relational, and Strange': a Preliminary Foray into a Project to Queer Breastfeeding." ''Australian Feminist Studies''. '''19''' (45):301–314&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher Nikki Sullivan, in her book ''A Critical Introduction to Queer Theory'', calls erotic lactation a manifestation of "Queer."  She defines Queer as an ideology; that is, as a "sort of vague and indefinable set of practices and (political) positions that has the potential to challenge normative knowledges and identities." Drawing on a statement of David Halperin, she continues "since queer is a positionality rather than an identity in the humanist sense, it is not restricted to gays and lesbians but can be taken up by anyone who feels marginalised as a result of their sexual practices."  The heteronormative profile of breastfeeding assumes certain norms:
*an infant between zero and twelve months old;
*motivations of nutritional and developmental benefits for the child and physiological benefits for the mother;
*possible secondary motivations of convenience and cheapness;
*practice in private, domestic settings; and
*breast milk-consumption exclusivity to the youngest infant
Additionally, any relevant third party is assumed to be the mother's [[significant other]] and this person is regulated to a supportive role to maximise the breastfeeding mother's success.&lt;ref name="giles" /&gt;

== Varieties ==
The following are various methods people employ to practice erotic lactation. They are listed according to prevalence, in decreasing order:
; Lactation games: Any kind of sexual activity which includes the woman's milk. Such activity is widespread, and often unintentional, in the time after a woman gives birth, since many women experience a [[let-down reflex]] (releasing milk) when sexually aroused.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;
; Lactation pornography: While lactation does appear in [[pornography]], it is a specialty niche and is considered taboo by many because of its proximity to incest and children.&lt;ref name="forth133-136" /&gt;  Most breast representations are without milk, and abound in the media in an erotic way both in and out of pornography.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;
; &lt;span id="anr"&gt;Adult Nursing Relationship (ANR)&lt;/span&gt;: The suckling of milk from a female's breast on a regular basis from one or more partner(s). Successful ANRs depend on a stable and long-term relationship, as otherwise it is very difficult to maintain a steady milk flow. Couples may begin an ANR by transferring regular suckling from a child to a sexual partner (e.g. spouse). Such a relationship may form as an expression of close intimacy and mutual tenderness, and may even exist without sex.&lt;ref name="forth133-136" /&gt; Breastfeeding can have a strong stabilizing effect on the partnership.&lt;ref name="forth133-136" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buttenstedt, Carl: The "Marriage of happiness": the revelation of woman: A study in nature&lt;/ref&gt; The breastfeeding woman may experience orgasms or a pleasurable let-down reflex.
:ANRs have also been employed in cases where a mother may desire to breastfeed her child, but has to find an alternative to inducing lactation.&lt;ref&gt;(Harrison 1983, p. 158)&lt;/ref&gt;  She may have difficulty beginning lactation, so she supplements the infant's suckling with that of a partner.  Or there are cases where breastfeeding was interrupted for an extended period of time as a result of infant prematurity, infant absence, or mother's illness (taking prescription medication).&lt;ref&gt;(Budin 1907, p. 48)&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, adult nursing has often caused lactation to continue until it was possible for the child to resume breastfeeding. Others may want to nurse an adopted child, so use an ANR to stimulate breast milk production before the adoption occurs.  Though such scenarios do not have erotic motivations, erotic expression may be an additional aspect of the relationship.
; Pumping: Some women experience sensual pleasure from [[breast pump|pumping milk from their breasts]] or expressing milk manually—with or without a partner. In addition to the sensual pleasure, women have reported feeling more [[gender role|feminine]] while producing milk and continue with lactation for emotional or sensual reasons after weaning a baby.&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Giles: Fresh Milk – The Secret Life of Breasts, NY: Simon and Schuster; Sydney: Allen and Unwin, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
; Lactation prostitution: This is the act of breastfeeding '''adults''' for pay (not to be confused with breastfeeding infants or babies for pay, i.e.: wet nursing).  In 2003, there was a report of New Zealand brothel that offered lactation services to its clients.&lt;ref name="giles"/&gt;  Though not strictly prostitution, a Beijing restaurant offered breast-milk-based dishes on its menu.&lt;ref name="giles"/&gt;
; [[Paraphilic infantilism|Infantilism]]: The non-lactating partner assumes the role of a baby in sexual role-play.&lt;ref name="forth133-136" /&gt; Breastfeeding might play a secondary role in this type of relationship; and being pampered by "mommy", wearing diapers, or a hidden incestuous character may be the predominant motivation in this kind of relationship.
; [[BDSM]]:
:# '''Breastfeeding as a reward (or surrogate pleasure)''': Breastfeeding of the [[Submissive (BDSM)|submissive]] partner can serve as a reward for his/her submission.
:# '''Milking''': Milking of the submissive woman, or commanding her to give milk for her dominant partner.
:# '''Force-feeding''': Commanding the submissive partner to '''receive''' milk '''from''' his/her dominant partner.

== Lactation, re-lactation and induced lactation ==
Erotic lactation between partners or an adult nursing relationship may develop from natural breastfeeding of a baby. During the lactation period the partner starts to suckle on the female breast, and continues after the baby is weaned off. Milk production is continually stimulated and the milk flow continues.  According to the book ''Body parts: critical explorations in corporeality'', adult nursing may occur when an "individual, usually a mother, may choose to continue lactating after weaning a child, so that she avoids the significant physical challenge that inducing lactation can entail."&lt;ref name="forth133-136" /&gt;

However, milk production can be "artificially" and intentionally induced in the absence of any pregnancy in the woman. This is called [[induced lactation]], while a woman who has lactated before and restarts is said to [[relactation|relactate]]. This can be done by regularly sucking on the nipples (several times a day), massaging and squeezing the female breasts, or with additional help from temporary use of milk-inducing drugs, such as the [[dopamine]] [[antagonist]] [[Domperidone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

It is not necessary that the woman has ever been pregnant, and she can be well in her post-menopausal period.  Once established, lactation adjusts to demand.  As long as there is regular breast stimulation, lactation is possible.&lt;ref name=BP133/&gt;

== Adult lactation historically and culturally ==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Suck.JPG|thumb|200px|A woman suckles milk from another woman's breast]] --&gt;
Though birth is the beginning of the separation between mother and child, breastfeeding slows this process, making the mother and infant connect physically continually, sometimes for years.&lt;ref name="giles"/&gt;  As a source of nourishment, the immediacy of this connection is intensified.  Breastfeeding has a sexual element as a result of physiological factors.  In a study conducted in 1999, approximately 33 to 50 percent of mothers found breast feeding erotic, and among them 25 percent felt guilty because of this.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;  This study corroborated a study in 1949 that found that in a few cases where the arousal was strong enough to induce orgasm, some nursing mothers abandoned breastfeeding altogether.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt; In a 1988 questionnaire on orgasm and pregnancy published in a Dutch magazine for women, when asked "Did you experience, while breastfeeding, a sensation of sexual excitement?", 34 percent (or 153 total) answered in the affirmative.  An additional 71 percent answered in the affirmative when asked "Did you experience, while breastfeeding, pleasurable contractions in the uterine region"&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;

== Adult lactation in history ==
{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}
Since the European [[Middle Ages]], a multitude of subliminally erotic, visionary experiences of saints have been passed on in which breastfeeding plays a major role. One prominent example is the Lactatio of Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux]].&lt;ref&gt;Panizza, Oskar &lt;1853-1921&gt;: Die Wallfahrt nach Andechs. – 1894.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman Charity ===
[[File:Cimon and Pero - Hans Sebald Beham.jpg|thumb|"Cimon and Pero" by Hans Sebald Beham]]
[[File:Roman Charity - Pieter Pauwel Reubens.jpg|thumb|"[[Roman Charity]]" by Peter Paul Rubens 1612]]

[[Roman Charity]] (or ''Caritas Romana'').&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Maximus: Facta et dicta memorabilia, chapter: 5,4 De pietate in parentes.; ''English translation: Valerius Maximus, Memorable Doings and Sayings, ed. by D. R. Shackleton Bailey (Harvard University Press, 2000), vol. 1, book v, no. 4, pp. 501–503''&lt;/ref&gt; is a story of a woman, Pero, who secretly breastfeeds her father, Cimon, after he is incarcerated and sentenced to death by starvation. She is found out by a jailer, but her act of selflessness impresses officials and wins her father's release. The story comes from the Roman writer [[Valerius Maximus]] in the years AD 14–AD 37. In about AD 1362 the story was retold by the famous writer [[Giovanni Boccaccio]].&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Boccaccio: De claris mulieribus, chapter: LXV. De romana iuvencula;'' English translation: Giovanni Boccaccio, Famous Women. Edited and translated by Virginia Brown. The I Tatti Renaissance Library. Cambridge, MA, and London, England: Harvard University Press, 2001''&lt;/ref&gt;  After Boccaccio, hundreds or possibly thousands of paintings were created, which tell the story.  A variant of this story can be found at the conclusion of [[John Steinbeck]]'s 1939 novel ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''. Primarily, the story tells of a conflict. An existing taboo (implied incest and adult breastfeeding of a woman's milk) ''or'' saving a life by breaking the taboo. In this aspect there is no erotic focus to the story.

Valerius Maximus tells another story about a woman breastfeeding her mother, which is followed by the very short story of a woman breastfeeding her father. The second, father-daughter story in fact consists of one sentence only. Thirteen hundred years later, Boccaccio retells the (first) mother-daughter story, and does not mention the father-daughter story, and the first is apparently forgotten, leading to nearly all "caritas romana" oil paintings and drawings showing only the father-daughter story.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

=== Pre-industrial England ===
Adult suckling was used to treat ailing adults and treat illnesses including eye disease and pulmonary tuberculosis{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}. The writer Thomas Moffat recorded one physician's use of a wet nurse in a tome first published in 1655.&lt;ref&gt;(Prior 1991, p. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Boswell-Penc 2006, p. 22)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamic law ===
In traditional [[Sharia|Islamic law]], someone who suckles the breast of a woman, who is less than 2 years old&lt;ref name="sistani.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sistani.org/local.php?modules=nav&amp;nid=2&amp;bid=59&amp;pid=3089 |accessdate=July 18, 2010|title=Islamic Laws : Marriage » Conditions of pronouncing Nikah |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100119121652/http://www.sistani.org/local.php?modules=nav&amp;nid=2&amp;bid=59&amp;pid=3089 |archive-date= 19 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (besides many strict rules like that the suckling should be of such quantity that it could be said that the bones of the child were strengthened and the flesh allowed to grow. And if that cannot be ascertained, then if a child suckles for one full day and night, or if it suckles fifteen times to its fill, it will be sufficient&lt;ref name="sistani.org"/&gt;), is that woman's child through a foster relationship (the woman is then called "milk mother"). However, according to the Jurist [[Abu's-Su`ud]] (c.1490–1574), this only applies to sucklings under the age of two and a half years.&lt;ref&gt;(Imber 1997, p. 195)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to Ayatollah Ali Sistani, a highly praised scholar for the Shia Muslims: "The child should not have completed two years of his age".&lt;ref name="sistani.org"/&gt; The same latter source states at least 8 conditions that should apply before that child is considered a son/daughter of the feeding woman. A modern Saudi Jurist, in 1983, upheld that if a man suckles from his wife, their marriage is nullified.&lt;ref&gt;(Abdella Doumato 2000, p. 273)&lt;/ref&gt;  The query remains a popular one into the 21st century, and has come up in Saudi advice columns.&lt;ref&gt;(Elhadj 2006, p. 125)&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Sunni]] cleric Sheik [[Ezzat Atiya]] (عزت عطية), President of the Hadith Department of Egypt's [[al-Azhar University]] issued a [[fatwa]] in 2007 encouraging women to breastfeed their male business colleagues so that the man could become symbolically related to the woman, thereby precluding any sexual relations and the need for both sexes to [[Sex segregation in Islam|observe modesty]]. "Breast feeding an adult puts an end to the problem of the private meeting" It was later denounced and declared defamatory to [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6681511.stm|title=Breastfeeding fatwa causes stir|work=BBC News|date=22 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
In 2013 a domestic staff agency in China named Xinxinyu was reported to be providing wet nurses for the sick and other adults as well as for newborns. The agency's clients could choose to drink the breast milk directly from the breast or to drink it via a breast pump. The reports caused controversy in China, with one writer describing it as "adding to China's problem of treating women as consumer goods and the moral degradation of China's rich." The agency was forced to suspend its operations by Chinese authorities for a number of reasons, one of which was for missing three years of annual checks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/07/04/adult-breast-feeding-report-incenses-china-web-users/#ixzz2YGcidHEK | work=Fox News | title=Adult breast feeding report incenses China web users | date=2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
In 1903, German philosopher Carl Buttenstedt published his marriage guidebook "''Die Glücksehe – Die Offenbarung im Weibe, eine Naturstudie''" (''The Marriage of Happiness – The Revelation in the Woman, a study from nature''), in which he described and recommended the [[lactational amenorrhea]] method (LAM) as a form of [[contraception]] and natural family planning that also deepens the relationship between wife and husband. He explicitly described erotic lactation as a source of great sexual pleasure for both partners, claiming that this is intended by nature especially on the part of the woman. This particular aspect of his broader general marriage philosophy gained a lot of attention and sparked wide debate. While some welcomed Buttenstedt's advice as inspirational for new ways to improve sexual satisfaction between marriage partners, others warned that this technique could "pathologically increase sexual sensation of both partners."&lt;ref&gt;E.

The ''Bonyu Bar'' (Mother’s Milk Bar), located in [[Tokyo]]’s entertainment and red-light district of [[Kabukichō, Tokyo|Kabukicho]], employs nursing women who provide customers with breast milk in a glass for 2,000 yen (about 15 euros) or directly from the nipple for 5000 yen (about 37.50 euros).

An '''eyepatch''' is a small patch that is worn in front of one [[eye]]. It may be a cloth patch attached around the head by an elastic band or by a string, an adhesive bandage, or a plastic device which is clipped to a pair of glasses. It is often worn by people to cover a lost or injured eye, but it also has a therapeutic use in children for the treatment of [[amblyopia]]. ''(See [[orthoptics]] and [[vision therapy]].)'' Eyepatches used to block light while sleeping are referred to as a [[sleep mask]].  Eyepatches associated with pirates are a [[stereotype]] originating from fiction.

An '''eyepad''' or '''eye pad''' is a soft medical dressing that can be applied over an eye to protect it. It is not necessarily the same as an eyepatch.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22eye+pad%22+OR+%22eyepad%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=kYoNWJ7AGanS8AfcxKboCA Google search]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the years before advanced medicine and surgery, eyepatches were common for people who had lost an eye. They were particularly prevalent among members of dangerous occupations, such as soldiers and sailors who could lose an eye in battle, as well as blacksmiths who used them to cover one eye for protection from sparks while working.{{cn|date=October 2018}}  While stereotypically associated with pirates, there is no evidence to suggest the historicity of eye patch wearing pirates before several popular novels of the 19th century (see Pirate Eyepatches below).

Patching the good eye forces the amblyopic eye to function, thereby causing vision in that eye to be retained.&lt;ref name = GK07 /&gt;&lt;ref name = GK08 /&gt; It is important to perform “near activities” (such as reading or handiwork) when patched, thereby exercising active, attentive vision.&lt;ref name="pmid23201436"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Birch EE |title=Amblyopia and binocular vision |journal=Progress in Retinal and Eye Research |volume=33 |issue= |pages=67–84 |year=2013 |pmid=23201436 |pmc=3577063 |doi=10.1016/j.preteyeres.2012.11.001 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study provided evidence that children treated for amblyopia with eye patching had lower self-perception of [[social acceptance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Webber AL, Wood JM, Gole GA, Brown B |title=Effect of amblyopia on self-esteem in children |journal=Optometry and Vision Science |volume=85 |issue=11 |pages=1074–81 |date=November 2008  |pmid=18981922 |doi=10.1097/OPX.0b013e31818b9911 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent a child from being socially marginalized by his or her peers due to wearing an eye patch, [[Atropine#Optical penalization|atropine eye drops]] may be used instead. This induces temporary blurring in the treated eye.

It has been pointed out that the penalization of one eye by means of patching or atropine drops does not provide the conditions that are necessary in order to develop or improve [[binocular vision]]. Recently, efforts have been made to propose alternative treatments of amblyopia that do allow for the improvement of binocular sight, for example using [[binasal occlusion]] or partially frosted spectacles&lt;ref name="cordis-svs"/&gt; in place of any eye patch, using [[Alternating occlusion training|alternating occlusion goggles]] or using methods of [[perceptual learning]] based on [[Stereopsis recovery#Stereopsis following training procedures|video games or virtual reality games for enhancing binocular vision]].

A 2014 Cochrane Review sought to determine the effectiveness of occlusion treatment on patients with sensory deprivation amblyopia, however no trials were found eligible to be included in the review.&lt;ref name="Antonio"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Antonio-Santos A, Vedula SS, Hatt RR, Powell C |title= Occlusion for stimulus deprivation amblyopia |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=2 |pages= CD005136 |date=2014 |pmid= 24504975|doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD005136.pub3 |pmc=4260153}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is suggested that good outcomes from occlusion treatment for sensory deprivation amblyopia rely on compliance with the treatment.

===Extraocular muscle palsy===
To initially relieve double vision ([[diplopia]]) caused by an extra-ocular muscle palsy, an [[eye care professional]] may recommend using an eyepatch. This can help to relieve the dizziness, vertigo and nausea that are associated with this form of double vision.&lt;ref name=osullivan&gt;O'Sullivan, S.B &amp; Schmitz, T.J. (2007).

==Use for adaptation to dark==

===Pirates===
[[File:Two sailors with amputated legs, an eyepatch and an amputate Wellcome V0020360.jpg|right|thumb|upright|1783 etching of wounded sailors]]
[[Rahmah ibn Jabir al-Jalahimah]], once the most popular pirate in the [[Persian Gulf]], was also the first to wear an eyepatch after losing an eye in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lampe|first=Christine|title=The Book of Pirates|publisher=Gibbs Smith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ALG4cH7lRGEC&amp;pg=PA14|page=14|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Belgrave |first1=Charles |title=The Pirate Coast |date=1966 |publisher=George Bell &amp; Sons |page= 122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although eyepatches have since become stereotypically associated with [[Pirates in popular culture|pirates]], the source is unclear, and there is no historical evidence to suggest that their use was for any other reason than protecting and concealing the eye socket after the loss of an eye. Most historical depictions of seamen with eye patches are of ex-sailors, rather than pirates.

More recent medical texts have often referred to the eye patch as a "pirate's patch" and writing in the Minnesota Academy of Sciences Journal in 1934, Charles Sheard of the [[Mayo Clinic|Mayo foundation]], pointed out that by "wearing a patch (The pirate's patch) over one eye, it will keep the covered eye in a state of readiness and adaptation for night vision".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheard|first=Charles|year=1934|title=Night Vision|journal=Minnesota Academy of Sciences Journal|volume=2-12|page=26|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OxkgAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=pirates+eye+patch+vision&amp;dq=pirates+eye+patch+vision&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjloa-t2ODZAhUnJcAKHdBqBfwQ6AEIPTAF}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was explored during WWII by institutes such as the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1944|title=Night Vision|journal=Addendum to the Handbook of the Hospital Corps, United States Navy. 1939|publisher=United States. Navy Dept. Bureau of Medicine and Surgery|pages=A–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal that pirates may have worn an eyepatch so that one eye would be pre-adjusted to below-deck darkness was tested in an episode of [[Mythbusters]] in 2007 and found to be plausible, but without any recorded historical precedent.&lt;ref name="MythBusters, episode 71"&gt;[http://mythbustersresults.com/epsode71 MythBusters, episode 71]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aircraft pilots===
[[Aircraft pilot]]s used an eye patch, or close one eye to preserve night vision when there was disparity in the light intensity within or outside their aircraft, such as when flying at night over brightly lit cities, so that one eye could look out, and the other would be adjusted for the dim lighting of the cockpit to read unlit instruments and maps.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Brocklebank (2005). ''WORLD WAR III – The 1960s Version. Journal of Navigation'', 58, pp 341-347 {{doi|10.1017/S0373463305003413}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some military pilots have worn a lead-lined or gold-lined eyepatch, to protect against blindness in both eyes, in the event of a [[Effects of nuclear explosions|nuclear blast]] or [[Laser applications#Eye-targeted lasers|laser weapon]] attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightgear.dk/flash.htm Nuclear flash eye protection, Steen Hartov]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lesfrazier.com/labs.htm Les Frazier]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hotmedicalnews.com/laser_weapons.php Laser Weapons]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eyepatches are not currently used by military personnel; modern technology has provided an array of other means to preserve and enhance night vision, including red-light and low-level white lights, and [[night vision device]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA156271&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf | title = IMMEDIATE VISIBILITY AFTER RED AND WHITE ADAPTATION | accessdate = 2011-06-01 | last = Luria | first = S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11009">The '''Feingold diet''' is an [[elimination diet]] initially devised by Dr. [[Benjamin Feingold]] following research in the 1970s which appeared to link [[food additives]] with [[hyperactivity]]; by eliminating these additives and various foods the diet was supposed to alleviate the condition.

Popular in its day, the diet has since been referred to as an "outmoded treatment"; there is no good evidence that it is effective,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Turka LA, Caplan A |title=What is the evidence for our standards of care? |journal=J. Clin. Invest. |volume=121 |issue=7 |pages=2530 |date=July 2011  |pmid=21737884 |pmc=3127439 |doi=10.1172/JCI59185 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KavaleForness1983"/&gt; and it is difficult for people to follow.&lt;ref name=rcp/&gt;

== Technique ==
The diet was originally based on the elimination of [[salicylate]], artificial [[food coloring]], and artificial [[flavors]];&lt;ref name=Quackwatch/&gt; later on in the 1970s, the preservatives [[Butylated hydroxyanisole|BHA]], [[Butylated hydroxytoluene|BHT]],&lt;ref name=MatthewSmith/&gt; and (somewhat later) [[tert-Butylhydroquinone|TBHQ]]&lt;ref name="Stevens2011"&gt;

Besides foods with the eliminated additives, aspirin- or additive-containing drugs and toiletries were to be avoided. Even today, parents are advised to limit their purchases of mouthwash, toothpaste, cough drops, perfume, and various other nonfood products to those published in the Feingold Association's annual ''Foodlist and Shopping Guide''.&lt;ref name=Quackwatch/&gt; Some versions of the diet prohibit only artificial food coloring and additives.&lt;ref name=karanek/&gt; According to the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] {{asof|lc=yes|2014}} the diet prohibited a number of foods which contain salicylic acid including [[apple]]s, [[cucumber]]s and [[tomato]]es.&lt;ref name=rcp/&gt;

Feingold stressed that the diet must be followed strictly and for an entire lifetime, and that whole families&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; not just the subject being "treated"&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; must observe the diet's rules.&lt;ref name=karanek&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kanarek RB |title=Artificial food dyes and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder |journal=Nutr.

== Effectiveness ==
{{further information|Diet and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}}
Although the diet had a certain popular appeal, a 1983 [[meta-analysis]] found research on it to be of poor quality, and that overall there was no good evidence that it was effective in fulfilling its claims.&lt;ref name="KavaleForness1983"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kavale KA, Forness SR |title=Hyperactivity and Diet Treatment: A Meta-Analysis of the Feingold Hypothesis |journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities |volume=16 |issue=6 |year=1983 |pages=324–330 |issn=0022-2194 |doi=10.1177/002221948301600604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common with other elimination diets, the Feingold diet can be expensive and boring, and so difficult for people to maintain.&lt;ref name=rcp&gt;{{cite web |title=Eating well and mental health |publisher=Royal College of Psychiatrists |url=http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/healthadvice/problemsdisorders/eatingwellandmentalhealth.aspx |date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, {{asof|2013|lc=yes}} there is no evidence to support broad claims that food coloring causes [[food intolerance]] and [[ADHD]]-like behavior in children.&lt;ref&gt;Tomaska LD and Brooke-Taylor, S.

== Reception ==
For decades, the Feingold Program required a significant change in family lifestyle because families were limited to a narrow selection of foods. Such foods were sometimes expensive or had to be prepared "from scratch," greatly increasing the amount of time and effort a family must put into preparing a meal.&lt;ref name="Quackwatch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/feingold.html |publisher=[[Quackwatch]] | title=The Feingold Diet: Dubious Benefits, Subtle Risks |author=Barrett S |authorlink=Stephen Barrett |accessdate=December 2014 |date=15 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more and more foods without the potentially offending additives are being produced and available in neighborhood supermarkets, this is much less a problem.&lt;ref name="MatthewSmith" /&gt;

While some fruits and a few vegetables are eliminated in the first weeks of the Program, they are replaced by others.  Often, some or all of these items can be returned to the diet, once the level of tolerance is determined.&lt;ref name="Dumbrell78"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dumbrell, S. | author2 = Woodhill, J.M. | author3 = Mackie, L. | author4 = Leelarthaepin, B. | last-author-amp = yes |date=December 1978 | title = Is the Australian version of the Feingold diet safe? | journal = The Medical Journal of Australia | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 569–570 | pmid = 364258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  at the [[Mayo Clinic]] and later Feingold at Kaiser, hypothesized that eliminating both salicylates and synthetic food additives from patients' diets not only eliminated allergic-type reactions such as asthma, eczema and hives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lockey, SD Sr. | title = Hypersensitivity to tartrazine (FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5) and other dyes and additives present in foods and pharmaceutical products. | journal = Annals of Allergy | volume = 38 | issue = 3  | pages = 206–210 | date= 1977 | pmid=842907

A two-week-long conference was arranged in January 1975, in Glen Cove, Long Island. There, the Nutrition Foundation attendees created what they called the National Advisory Committee. The committee widely published its preliminary report concluding that "no controlled studies have demonstrated that hyperkinesis is related to the ingestion of food additives."&lt;ref name="MatthewSmith" /&gt;

'''Frank Stanley Cotton''' (30 April 1890 – 23 August 1955) was an [[Australia]]n lecturer in [[physiology]], specialising in the study of the effects of physical strain on the human body.

==Early life==
Frank Stanley Cotton was born on 30 April 1890 at [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]], [[Sydney, New South Wales]]. He was the son of Australian politician Francis Cotton (1857–1942), and brother of [[Ernest Shackleton|Shackleton]] expeditioner and geology professor, [[Leo Arthur Cotton]] (1883–1963). Pioneer art photographer [[Olive Cotton]] was his niece.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;Nairn (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Sydney Boys High School]] in 1904–08.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shsobu.org.au/wp-content/uploads/professors.pdf|format=PDF|title=Professors|website=Shsobu.org.au|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, Frank married Catherine Drummond Smith, a geology demonstrator who taught at the University of Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/cotton-frank-stanley-6326|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|first=Bede|last=Nairn|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|accessdate=14 August 2017|via=Australian Dictionary of Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burek, C and Higgs, B eds. 2007 The role of women in the history of geology, Geological society of London&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inventions==
;Anti-Gravity Suit
In 1940, whilst at the [[University of Sydney]], Professor Cotton invented the "Cotton aerodynamic anti-G flying suit" ([[G-suit]]), which prevented pilots from blacking out when making high speed turns or pulling out of a dive. This was used extensively by pilots in the Allied air forces during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=unisydneyhistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physiol.usyd.edu.au/info/brhistory.html|title=Department of Physiology, University of Sydney|website=Physiol.usyd.edu.au|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Ergometer
Cotton was also responsible for the [[Exercise machine|ergometer]], a machine to test the athletic potential of sportsmen and women. Cotton claimed through this machine to have discovered the swimmers [[Jon Henricks]] and [[Judy-Joy Davies]]. The Australian swimming coach, [[Forbes Carlile]], began his career as an assistant to Cotton.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=unisydneyhistory/&gt;

==Later life==
On 23 August 1955, Frank Cotton died at [[Hornsby, New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

[[File:Полоскание. 2013.jpg|thumb|''Gargling'' by Pavel Otdelnov]]
'''Gargling''' (same root as 'gurgle') is the act of bubbling liquid in the [[mouth]]. Vibration caused by the muscles in the throat and back of the mouth cause the liquid to bubble and flurry around inside the mouth cavity.

A traditional home remedy of gargling warm saltwater is sometimes recommended to soothe a sore throat. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/features/does-gargling-wlth-salt-water-ease-a-sore-throat#1|title=Does Gargling With Salt Water Ease a Sore Throat?|publisher=WebMD|author=Chris C. Anderson|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in [[Japan]] has shown that gargling water a few times a day will lower the chance of [[upper respiratory infection]]s such as [[common cold|colds]], though some medical authorities are skeptical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Does Gargling With Water Prevent Colds?|url=http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20051020/does-gargling-with-water-prevent-colds|publisher=WebMD|first=Salynn|last=Boyles|date=2005-10-19|accessdate=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9879">'''The Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry''' (GAP) is an [[United States|American]] professional organization of [[psychiatrist]]s dedicated to shaping psychiatric thinking, public programs and clinical practice in mental health. Its 29 committees meet semi-annually and choose their own topics for exploration. They explore issues and ideas on the frontiers of psychiatry and in applying psychiatric insights into general medical, social, and interpersonal problems.

==History of GAP==

GAP was part of a larger move toward professionalization of the field.&lt;ref name="richardson"&gt;Richardson, Theresa R. (1989). ''The Century of the Child: The Mental Hygiene Movement and Social Policy in the United States and Canada.'' SUNY Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-0020-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; GAP was founded in May 1946 by a group of young psychiatrists who had served in [[World War II]].  They returned to the U.S. to find an inadequate system of civilian care and were impatient with the traditionalism of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (which had originally been founded as an association of asylum superintendent).&lt;ref name="apahistory"&gt;History of the American Psychiatric Association from the [http://www.psych.org/MainMenu/EducationCareerDevelopment/Library/APAHistoricalHighlights.aspx APA website]&lt;/ref&gt;  
GAP was formed under the leadership of 
Dr. [[William C. Menninger]]&lt;ref name="kshs"&gt;[http://www.kshs.org/research/collections/documents/businessrecords/business_records_findingaids/menninger/menninger_family.htm#william William Menninger] in the Menninger Family Archives from Kansas State Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;  
and  the "young turks" in American psychiatry who were eager to professionalize the field.&lt;ref name="shorter1997"&gt;Shorter, Edward (1997). ''A History of Psychiatry: From the Era of the Asylum to the Age of Prozac.'' John Wiley and Sons, {{ISBN|978-0-471-24531-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Menninger wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The organization of GAP was not a revolution.  With the deepest sincerity, the founding group was seeking a way in which American psychiatry could give more forceful leadership, both medically and socially. Although the name may sound presumptuous, it was chosen because of the sense of great urgency that psychiatry should advance, and the belief that by hard work, and teamwork, we could help it do so. Those early years of GAP were marked by the feeling on the part of its membership that much needed to be done, and quickly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Publications==

GAP's first published report (by the Committee on Therapy) was on the "promiscuous and indiscriminate use of [[electro-shock therapy]]."&lt;ref name="menninger1948"&gt;Menninger, WC (1948). Notices and Bulletins. ''Psychosomatic medicine'' 10(1): 54-56. [http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/reprint/10/1/54.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;   
GAP's formulated policy to discuss controversial psychosocial issues was announced in 1950, in the Committee on Social Issues' Report, ''The Social Responsibility of Psychiatry, A Statement of Orientation''.&lt;ref name="GAP1950"&gt;Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry, Committee on Social Issues.  (1950). ''The Social Responsibility of Psychiatry, A Statement of Orientation''.  New York: Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry.&lt;/ref&gt; In that Report, the Committee noted that two factors had been influential in causing diverse social problems in psychiatry: the role of prejudice in determining attitudes towards social problems and the sparse knowledge about the relationship between society and personality. In this pioneering document, the Committee on Social Issues emphasized the social responsibility of psychiatry. It made a number of suggestions for broadening the conceptual framework of psychiatry to include: "redefinition of the concept of mental illness, emphasizing those dynamic principles which pertain to the person's interaction with society ... examination of the social factors which contribute to the causation of mental illness and also influence its course and outcome ... consideration of the specific group psychological phenomena which are relevant, in a positive sense, to community mental health ... the development of criteria for social action, relevant to the promotion of individual and community mental health."&lt;ref name="GAP1950"/&gt; By 1955 the group was advocating an "objective critical attitude should orient the field.&lt;ref name="lane2007"&gt;Lane, Christopher (2007). ''Shyness: How Normal Behavior Became a Sickness.'' Yale University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-300-12446-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GAP continued to produce position statements on relevant and controversial psychiatric issues such as [[abortion]],&lt;ref name="gapabortion"&gt;Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry. (1969). The right to abortion: A psychiatric view.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[Recreational drug use|drug use]],&lt;ref name="gapdrug"&gt;Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry. (1971). Drug misuse; A psychiatric view of a modern dilemma. New York: Scribner.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[school desegregation]],&lt;ref name="gapdesegregation"&gt;Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry. (1957). Psychiatric aspects of school desegregation. Report (Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[loyalty oath]]s,&lt;ref name="gaployalty"&gt;Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry. (1954). Considerations regarding the loyalty oath as a manifestation of current social tension and anxiety. Topeka, Kans: The Group.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]],&lt;ref name="gapnuclear"&gt;Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry. (1960). The psychological and medical aspects of the use of nuclear energy. New York: The Group.&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[euthanasia]].&lt;ref name="gapeuthanasia"&gt;Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry. (1973). The right to die: decision and decision makers.&lt;/ref&gt;
Its  "Report on homosexuality with particular emphasis on this problem in governmental agencies" (1955) criticized "witch hunts" against [[homosexual]]s working in the U.S. government.&lt;ref name="rosario2002"&gt;Rosario, VA (2002)  ''Homosexuality and Science: A Guide to the Debates''.  Santa Barbara: ABC Clio, pp. 122-123.&lt;/ref&gt;
and the purging of homosexuals from the government.&lt;ref name="gaphomosexual"&gt;Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry. (1955). Report on homosexuality with particular emphasis on this problem in governmental agencies.&lt;/ref&gt;
GAP reports were concise, published soon after they were written and widely respected and influential.

==Membership==

GAP is composed of over 200 leaders in psychiatry who meet twice a year to debate and think through pertinent issues in psychiatry.  
In over 50 years, GAP has shared Presidents with other national psychiatric organizations including:  The [[American Psychiatric Association]], the [[American College of Psychiatrists]], and the [[American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]]. GAP has researchers recognized nationally and internationally in the areas of [[Substance dependence|addiction]], [[geriatrics]], [[child and adolescent psychiatry]], [[terrorism]] and [[academics]].

The '''Gulf War Health Research Reform Act of 2014''' ({{USBill|113|hr|4261}}) is a bill that would alter the relationship between the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses (RAC) and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA). The bill would make the RAC an independent organization within the VA, require that a majority of the RAC's members be appointed by Congress instead of the VA, and state that the RAC can release its reports without needing prior approval from the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.&lt;ref name="CoffmanPRmar14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USAtoday14mar"/&gt; The RAC is responsible for investigating [[Gulf War syndrome]], a chronic multisymptom disorder affecting returning military [[veterans]] and civilian workers of the [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref name="veteranIllnesses"/&gt;

The bill was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].

==Background==
{{main|Gulf War syndrome}}

Gulf War syndrome (GWS), also known as Gulf War illness (GWI), is a chronic multisymptom disorder affecting returning military [[veterans]] and civilian workers of the [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref name=veteranIllnesses&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/gulfwar/associated_illnesses.asp | title = Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses: Illnesses Associated with Gulf War Service | date = nd | accessdate = 2012-05-09 | publisher = United States Department of Veterans Affairs }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Iversen A, Chalder T, Wessely S |title=Gulf War Illness: lessons from medically unexplained symptoms |journal=Clin Psychol Rev |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=842–54 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17707114 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2007.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gronseth GS |title=Gulf war syndrome: a toxic exposure?

Suggested causes have included [[depleted uranium]], [[sarin]] gas, [[Kuwaiti oil fires|smoke from burning oil wells]], [[vaccination]]s, combat stress and psychological factors.&lt;ref name=FedReport/&gt;

In the year prior to the consideration of this bill, the VA and the RAC were at odds with one another.&lt;ref name="USAtoday14mar"/&gt; The VA replaced all but one of the members of the RAC, removed some of their supervisory tasks, tried to influence the board to decide that stress, rather than biology was the cause of Gulf War syndrome, and told the RAC that it could not publish reports without permission.&lt;ref name="USAtoday14mar"/&gt; The RAC was originally created in 1997, after Congress decided that the VA's research into the issue was flawed, and focused on psychological causes, while mostly ignoring biological ones.&lt;ref name="USAtoday14mar"/&gt;

==Provisions of the bill==
The bill would make the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses (RAC) an independent committee within the VA.&lt;ref name="CoffmanPRmar14"/&gt;&lt;ref name=USAtoday14mar&gt;{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Kelly|title=Congress seeks independence for Gulf War illness board|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/03/14/house-demands-independence-from-va-for-gulf-war-illness-advisory-board/6428299/|accessdate=27 May 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill would require the majority of RAC members be appointed by the chairmen and ranking members of the [[United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs]] and the [[United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs]].&lt;ref name="CoffmanPRmar14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USAtoday14mar"/&gt; Three of the members would be required to be veterans, while a minimum of eight members "must be scientists of physicians, with expertise in areas like epidemiology, immunology, neurology and toxicology."&lt;ref name=RuizCongressConfronts&gt;{{cite news|last=Ruiz|first=Rebecca|title=Congress Confronts VA Over Gulf War Illness Research|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccaruiz/2014/03/24/congress-confronts-va-over-gulf-war-illness-research/|accessdate=27 May 2014|newspaper=Forbes Magazine|date=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill would also mandate that the condition be called "Gulf War Illness" instead of "Gulf War Syndrome."&lt;ref name="CoffmanPRmar14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USAtoday14mar"/&gt;

The bill also requests that the VA look at animal studies when investigating toxic exposure.&lt;ref name="USAtoday14mar"/&gt;

The bill states that "reports, recommendations, publications, and other documents of the (RAC) committee shall not be subject to review or approval by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs."&lt;ref name="USAtoday14mar"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
The Gulf War Health Research Reform Act of 2014 was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on March 14, 2014 by [[Mike Coffman|Rep. Mike Coffman (R, CO-6)]].&lt;ref name=4261allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4261 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4261/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs]], the [[United States House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Health]], and the [[United States House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations]].&lt;ref name="4261allactions"/&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
According to Rep. Coffman, who sponsored the bill, the legislation is the result of an investigation by the House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations which determined that the Department of Veterans Affairs was "exercising too much control over the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses (RAC)" and was "denying their ability to effectively and independently carry out its Congressionally mandated role to improve the lives of Gulf War Veterans."&lt;ref name=CoffmanPRmar14&gt;{{cite web|last=Coffman|first=Mike|title=Bipartisan Bill on Gulf War Health Research|url=http://coffman.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/bipartisan-bill-on-gulf-war-health-research|publisher=House Office of Mike Coffman|accessdate=27 May 2014|date=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation found the misappropriation of funds, the placement of biased members in the RAC, and restrictions on RAC reports to keep them from circulating.&lt;ref name="CoffmanPRmar14"/&gt;

Rep. [[Ann Kirkpatrick]], who supported the bill, said that it was our job to ensure "the VA conducts objective research on chronic illnesses experienced by Gulf War veterans, in an effort to find treatments that can make a difference in their quality of life."&lt;ref name="CoffmanPRmar14"/&gt;

'''''Hand Held''''' is a 2010 [[Documentary film|documentary]] [[feature film]] about [[photojournalist]] Mike Carroll (''[[Boston Globe]]'', ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]''), one of the first photographers to travel to [[Romania]] after the fall of the communist regime of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20100224/NEWS/2240392/1011 | title=Bleak picture changing in Romania.

His photographs and heart wrenching stories of the pediatric [[AIDS]] epidemic in Romania ran in the ''Boston Globe ''and'' [[New York Times]]'' and opened the eyes of the western world to the plight of Romanian children.  The film chronicles Carroll's twenty-year journey to bring aid to children in a country he hardly knew, through the organization he founded, [[Romanian Children's Relief (RCR)]].

The film is produced and directed by [[Academy Award]] nominee [[Don Hahn]], the man famous for producing [[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|''Beauty and the Beast'']]'' ''and'' [[The Lion King]]'' for the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]].  After a charity premiere at [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] in [[Boston]], the film was selected for participation in the [[Heartland Film Festival]], and has been the official selection of the [[Boulder International Film Festival]], [[Newport Beach Film Festival]], and the [[Rhode Island International Film Festival]].  ''Hand Held''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'s European premiere was in &lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Bucharest]] in late 2010.  The director Don Hahn and subject Mike Carroll were introduced by United States Ambassador [[Mark Gitenstein]] who was in attendance at the premiere.

A '''high-stakes test''' is a [[Test (student assessment)|test]] with important consequences for the test taker.&lt;ref name="Lexicon of Learning"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ascd.org/Publications/Lexicon-of-Learning/H.aspx |title= Lexicon of Learning |publisher=Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Passing has important benefits, such as a high school diploma, a scholarship, or a license to practice a profession.  Failing has important disadvantages, such as being forced to take remedial classes until the test can be passed, not being allowed to drive a car, or difficulty finding employment.

The use and misuse of high-stakes tests are a controversial topic in public education, especially in the United States and U.K. where they have become especially popular in recent years, used not only to assess students but in attempts to increase teacher accountability.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Sutton &amp; Kelvin Seifert (2009) Educational Psychology, 2nd Edition: “Chapter 1: The Changing Teaching Profession and You.” pp 14 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Educational-Psychology.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under a more precise definition, a high-stakes test is any test that:
* is a single, defined assessment,
* has a clear line drawn between those who pass and those who fail, and
* has direct consequences for passing or failing (something "at stake").&lt;ref name=CPE&gt;{{cite web

High-stakes testing is not synonymous with high-pressure testing.  An American high school student might feel pressure to perform well on the [[SAT-I]] college aptitude exam.  However, SAT scores do not directly determine admission to any college or university, and there is no clear line drawn between those who pass and those who fail, so it is not formally considered a high-stakes test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 |quote=Gaston Caperton, president of the College Board, which publishes the SAT, counters that the SAT I is “not a high-stakes test” but is a useful admissions tool when considered along with other evidence of a student’s potential for college success.

 |quote=The ACT and SAT are not the highest stakes tests.  Indeed, they may more accurately be categorized as medium stakes tests.  One can do poorly on either test, and one will still get into college somewhere.  By contrast, a couple dozen states, and most other countries, require passage of a test in order to graduate.  That's high stakes.

&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, because the SAT-I scores are given significant weight in the admissions process at some schools, many people believe that it has consequences for doing well or poorly and is therefore a high-stakes test under the simpler, common definition.&lt;ref name=EPLC&gt;{{cite web |title=High-stakes Testing: Perils &amp; Opportunities |url=http://www.eplc.org/mpearlman.html|author=Mari Pearlman|date=April 4, 2001|accessdate=July 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925151533/http://www.eplc.org/mpearlman.html |archivedate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Admissions Officials Shrug at SAT Writing Test |url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/education/2008/04/30/admissions-officials-shrug-at-sat-writing-test.html |author=Eddy Ramírez |date=30 April 2008 |accessdate=24 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The stakes==
High stakes are not a characteristic of the test itself, but rather of the consequences placed on the outcome.  For example, no matter what test is used—written multiple choice, oral examination, performance test—a medical licensing test must be passed to practice medicine.

The perception of the stakes may vary. For example, college students who wish to skip an introductory-level course are often given exams to see whether they have already mastered the material and can be passed to the next level.  Passing the exam can reduce tuition costs and time spent at [[university]]. A student who is anxious to have these benefits may consider the test to be a high-stakes exam.  Another student, who places no importance on the outcome, so long as he is placed in a class that is appropriate to his skill level, may consider the same exam to be a low-stakes test.&lt;ref name=CPE /&gt;

The phrase "high stakes" is derived directly from a [[gambling]] term.  In gambling, a ''stake'' is the quantity of money or other goods that is risked on the outcome of some specific event. A high-stakes game is one in which, in the player's personal opinion, a large quantity of money is being risked. The term is meant to imply that implementing such a system introduces uncertainty and potential losses for test takers,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} who must pass the exam to "win," instead of being able to obtain the goal through other means.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Examples==
Examples of high-stakes tests and their "stakes" include:
* Driver's license tests and the legal ability to drive
* College [[entrance examination]]s in some countries, such as Japan's [[Common first-stage exam]], and admission to a high-quality university
* [[Visa interview]]/[[Citizenship test]] for [[Human migration|migration]] and [[naturalization]] purposes
* Many [[job interview]]s or [[drug test]]s and being hired
* High school exit examinations and high-school diplomas
* [[No Child Left Behind]] tests and school funding and ratings
* Ph.D. oral exams and receiving the doctorate
* Professional licensing and certification examinations (such as the [[bar exam]]s, [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] written tests, and medical exams) and the license or certification being sought
* [[Standardised test]] of [[language proficiency]] in work, school placement and visa application contexts
* [[NCLEX-RN]] or [[NCLEX-PN]] exam for nursing students

==Stakeholders==
A high-stakes system may be intended to benefit people other than the test-taker. For [[professional certification]] and [[licensure]] examinations, the purpose of the test is to protect the general public from incompetent practitioners. The individual stakes of the medical student and the [[medical school]] are, hopefully, balanced against the social stakes of possibly allowing an incompetent doctor to practice medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Mehrens, W.A. (1995). Legal and Professional Bases for Licensure Testing.' In Impara, J.C. (Ed.) ''Licensure testing: Purposes, procedures, and practices'', pp. 33-58. Lincoln, NE: Buros Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

A test may be "high-stakes" based on consequences for others beyond the individual test-taker.&lt;ref name="EDEX790" /&gt;  For example, an individual medical student who fails a licensing exam will not be able to practice his or her profession.  However, if enough students at the same school fail the exam, then the school's reputation and [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] may be in jeopardy.  Similarly, testing under the U.S.'s [[No Child Left Behind Act]] has no direct negative consequences for failing students,&lt;ref name="NCLB has nothing to do with the high-stakes nature of the test for students"&gt;

|author=Greene, Jay P., Marcus A. Winters, Greg Forster
|publisher=Manhattan Institute for Policy Research }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stakes are therefore high for the school, but low for the individual test-takers.

==Assessments used==
Any form of assessment can be used as a high-stakes test.  Many times, an inexpensive multiple-choice test is chosen for convenience.  A high-stakes assessment may also involve answering open-ended questions or a practical, hands-on section.  For example, a typical high-stakes licensing exam for a medical [[nurse]] determines whether the nurse can insert an I.V. line by watching the nurse actually do this task.  These assessments are called ''[[authentic assessment]]s'' or ''performance tests''.&lt;ref name="CPE" /&gt;

Some high-stakes tests may be [[standardized test]]s (in which all examinees take the same test under reasonably equal conditions), with the expectation that standardization affords all examinees a fair and equal opportunity to pass.&lt;ref name="CPE" /&gt;  Some high-stakes tests are non-standardized, such as a theater audition.

As with other tests, high-stakes tests may be [[criterion-referenced test|criterion-referenced]] or [[norm-referenced test|norm-referenced]].&lt;ref name="CPE" /&gt;  For example, a written driver's license examination typically is criterion-referenced, with an unlimited number of potential drivers able to pass if they correctly answer a certain percentage of questions.  On the other hand, essay portions of some [[bar exam]]s are often norm-referenced, with the worst essays failed and the best essays passed, without regard for the overall quality of the essays.

The "clear line" between passing and failing on an exam may be achieved through use of a [[Cutscore|cut score]]:  for example, test takers correctly answering 75% or more of the questions pass the test; test takers correctly answering 74% or fewer fail.  In large-scale high-stakes testing, rigorous and expensive [[Standard-setting study|standard-setting studies]] may be employed to determine the ideal cut score or to keep the test results consistent between groups taking the test at different times.

==Criticisms==
High-stakes tests, despite their extensive usage for determination of academic and non-academic proficiency, are subject to criticism for various reasons. Example concerns include the following: 
* '''The test does not correctly measure the individual's knowledge or skills.'''  For example, a test might purport to be a general reading-skills test, but it might actually determine whether or not the examinee has read a specific book. 
* '''The test may not measure what the critic wants measured.'''  For example, a test might accurately measure whether a [[law student]] has acquired fundamental knowledge of the legal system, but the critic might want students to be tested on [[legal ethics]] instead of legal knowledge.
* '''High-stakes testing may encourage teachers to omit material that is not tested.'''  "[[Teaching to the test]]" can result in a narrow curriculum and lower skills.  For example, if a driving exam does not test [[parallel parking]] skills, then driving instructors may stop teaching that skill to a driving student, in favor of focusing instruction time on the material that will be tested, such as determining which vehicle has the [[right of way]] at a [[four-way stop]].  The result is that the student will be able to pass the test, but may be unable to park a car safely in some places.  According to [[Campbell's law]], the higher the stakes are (for the test taker or for the school), the more likely this is to happen.
* '''Testing causes stress for some students.'''  Critics suggest that since some people perform poorly under the pressure associated with tests, any test is likely to be less representative of their actual standard of achievement than a non-test alternative.&lt;ref name="pmid9213292"&gt;{{cite journal

|issue=2
|pages=197–206
|year=1997
|pmid=9213292
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is called [[test anxiety]] or [[performance anxiety]].
* '''High-stakes tests are often given as a single long exam.'''  Some critics prefer [[continuous assessment]] instead of one larger test. For example, the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) opposes using a one-time [[high school exit examination]] as the single determinant of whether a student should graduate, saying, "Any decision about a student's continued education, such as retention, tracking, or graduation, should not be based on the results of a single test, but should include other relevant and valid information."&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/pubinfo/testing.html

|accessdate=2008-01-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the stakes are related to consequences, not method, however, short tests can also be high-stakes.
* '''High-stakes testing creates more incentive for cheating.'''&lt;ref name=Levitt&gt;{{cite news

|author=Jacob, Brian A. and [[Steven D. Levitt]]
|title=To Catch a Cheat
|work=Education Next
|date=Winter 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[cheating]] on a single critical exam may be easier than either learning the required material or earning credit through attendance, diligence, or many smaller tests, more examinees that do not actually have the necessary knowledge or skills, but who are effective cheaters, may pass. Also, some people who would otherwise pass the test but are not confident enough of themselves might decide to additionally secure the outcome by cheating, get caught and often face even worse consequences than just failing.  Additionally, if the test results are used to determine the teachers' pay or continued employment, or to evaluate the school, then school personnel may fraudulently alter student test papers to artificially inflate student performance.&lt;ref name=Levitt /&gt;
* '''Sometimes a high-stakes test is tied to a controversial reward.''' For example, some people may want a high-school diploma to represent the verified acquisition of specific skills or knowledge, and therefore use a high-stakes assessment to deny a diploma to anyone who cannot perform the necessary skills.&lt;ref name="titleFigure 1-10: Employee/faculty support for high stakes testing: 2000"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others may want a high school diploma to represent primarily a [[certificate of attendance]], so that a student who faithfully attended school but cannot read or write will still get the social benefits of graduation.  This use of tests — to deny a high school diploma, and thereby access to most jobs and higher education for a lifetime — is controversial even when the test itself accurately identifies students that do not have the necessary skills.  Criticism is usually framed as over-reliance on a single measurement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* '''High-stakes tests reveal that some examinees do not know the required material, or do not have the necessary skills.''' While failing these people may have many public benefits, the consequences of repeated failure can be very high for the individual. For example, a person who fails a practical driving exam will not be able to drive a car legally, which means they cannot drive to work and may lose their job if alternative transportation options are not available.  The person may suffer social embarrassment when his acquaintances discover that his lack of skill resulted in loss of his driver's license. In the context of high school exit exams, poorly performing school districts have received public scrutiny for their student's low test scores. While the tests accurately identified student's lack of required knowledge and reflected the districts' failures, the districts expressed formal opposition high-stakes tests after the results, which ultimately proved to be politically embarrassing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Hugo Gunckel Lüer''' (August 10, 1901 – July 17, 1997) was a [[Chile]]an [[pharmacist]], [[botanist]], and university [[professor]].

'''Gunckel''' is the [[ICBN]] [[author citation (botany)|author citation]] corresponding to Hugo Gunckel.

==Life==
Gunckel was born in [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]]. His primary and secondary studies were at the [[Colegio Alemán]] (founded by [[Carlos Anwandter]]) and in the lyceum of Hombres, enterring the [[Universidad de Concepción]] in 1921, from which he got a degree in pharmacy.

As assistant of botany to the Prof. Alcibíades Santa Cruz, he demonstrated his interest in nature, stimulated by his parents who offered him frequent excursions that allowed him to observe nature, plants, and their development. Later, the study of plants, their properties, and life conditions became a passion.

After graduating he worked as a professional in [[Talca]], in the pharmacy of Guillermo Kuschel, the distinguished trade union and industrial director, one of the founding partners of the Laboratorio Geka. Later Gunckel returned to Valdivia to serve as the pharmaceutical head of the Railroad Zone IV, work which was later suppressed.

Gunckel moved to [[Corral, Chile|Corral]], where he started a pharmacy, but the near-virgin landscape that surrounded this port, rich in forests, ferns, and grasses, made him a collector of plant specimens. In 1940 he moved to [[Temuco]], where he became the director of the Museo Araucano (today the [[Museo Regional de la Araucanía]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dibam.cl/subdirec_museos/mr_araucania/presenta.htm|title= Museo Regional de la Araucanía: History|accessdate= 2007-12-11|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071215184046/http://www.dibam.cl/subdirec_museos/mr_araucania/presenta.htm|archivedate= 2007-12-15|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 he was elected the first president of the Temuco Regional [[Council of the College of Pharmacists of Chile]] (''Consejo Regional en Temuco del Colegio de Farmacéuticos de Chile''), which was led by Victor M. Cereceda. In 1946 he became the president of the School of Forestry Engineers (''Escuela de Ingenieros Forestales''), the first establishment of the specialty created in Chile. However, he continued studying, and wrote articles for the daily ''Austral'', other newspapers in the region, and scientific journals. He was founding member of the Academia de Ciencias Naturales, which he was president of later for 12 years, and for which he wrote articles they published in their journal over the course of 20 years. With [[Hans Niemeyer]], he edited the "Revista Universitaria-Universidad Católica" or "Anales de la Academia de Ciencias Naturales."

On May 1, 1950 he moved to Santiago to fill the botany chair in the Facultad de Farmacia, which was directed by the professor Juan Ibáñez, who performed duties for [[UNESCO]] and thus was frequently travelling. His mission was the formation of the herbarium of the School of Chemistry and Pharmacy. At the same time, Gunckel taught classes at the [[Instituto Pedagógico de la Universidad de Chile]], today the Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educación, where he continued to serve until he retired in 1968. This body's journal ''Academia'' published some of his works related to botany and history (Gunckel 1982). He became an honorary member of the [[Sociedad Chilena de Historia y Geografía]] and a member of the [[Academia Chilena de la Lengua]].

Hugo Gunckel was also the founder and subdirector of the Third Company of Firefighters of Corral and served as mayor of the community{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}.

He died in [[Santiago de Chile]] at the age of 96.

'''Hunger''' and '''satiety''' are [[sense|sensation]]s. Hunger represents the physiological need to [[eating|eat]] [[food]]. Satiety is the absence of hunger; it is the sensation of feeling full.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/171192|title=satiety, n.|last=Oxford University Press|first=|date=|website=OED Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Appetite]] is another sensation experienced with eating; it is the desire to eat food. There are several theories about how the feeling of hunger arises. A healthy, well-nourished individual can survive for weeks without food intake, with claims ranging from three to ten weeks.&lt;ref name="guardian_water"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/dec/03/thisweekssciencequestions.uknews | title=How long can someone survive without water? | work=The Guardian | date=2005-12-27 | accessdate=2007-08-12 | author=Ravilious, Kate | location=London | quote="People can last a few days without water depending on the environment in which they find themselves and whether [they are] injured or not," says Jeremy Powell-Tuck, professor of clinical nutrition at Barts and the London Queen Mary school of medicine, who supervised Blaine's recovery.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lieberson (MD)|first=Alan|title=How long can a person survive without food?|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-long-can-a-person-sur/|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sensation of hunger typically manifests after only a few hours without eating and is generally considered to be unpleasant. Satiety occurs between 5 and 20 minutes after eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Steen|first1=Juliette|title=We Found Out If It Really Takes 20 Minutes To Feel Full|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/11/09/we-found-out-if-it-really-takes-20-minutes-to-feel-full/|accessdate=20 April 2017|work=Huffington Post|date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hunger]] is also the most commonly used term to describe the condition of people who suffer from a chronic lack of sufficient food and constantly or frequently experience the sensation of hunger, and is discussed in [[malnutrition]].

==Hunger pangs==
When hunger contractions start to occur in the [[stomach]], they are informally referred to as hunger pangs. Hunger pangs usually do not begin until 12 to 24 hours after the last ingestion of food. A single hunger contraction lasts about 30 seconds, and pangs continue for around 30 to 45 minutes, then hunger subsides for around 30 to 150 minutes. Individual contractions are separated at first, but are almost continuous after a certain amount of time. [[Emotion]]al states (anger, joy etc.) may inhibit hunger contractions. Levels of hunger are increased by lower [[blood sugar]] levels, and are higher in [[diabetic]]s. They reach their greatest intensity in three to four days and may weaken in the succeeding days, although research suggests that hunger never disappears.  Hunger contractions are most intense in young, healthy people who have high degrees of [[gastrointestinal]] [[Muscle tone|tonus]]. Periods between contractions increase with old age. {{mcn|date=October 2018}}

==Short-term regulation of hunger and food intake==
Short-term regulation of hunger and food intake involves neural signals from the GI tract, blood levels of nutrients, GI tract hormones, and psychological factors.

===Neural signals from the GI tract===
One method that the brain uses to evaluate the contents of the gut is through vagal nerve fibers that carry signals between the brain and the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] (GI tract). Stretch receptors work to inhibit appetite upon distention of the GI tract by sending signals along the vagus nerve afferent pathway and inhibiting the hunger center.&lt;ref name="Marieb, E. 2010 pp. 945-947"&gt;Marieb, E., &amp; Marieb, E. (2010). Human anatomy &amp; physiology. (8th ed. ed., pp. 945-947). San Francisco: Pearson Benjamin Cummings.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrient signals===
Blood levels of glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids provide a constant flow of information to the brain that may be linked to regulating hunger and energy intake. Nutrient signals that indicate fullness, and therefore inhibit hunger include rising blood glucose levels, elevated blood levels of amino acids, and blood concentrations of fatty acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=4Do-bFrt9tUC |page=302 |title=Essentials of Psychology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hormone signals===
The hormones [[insulin]] and [[cholecystokinin|cholecystokinin (CCK)]] are released from the GI tract during food absorption and act to suppress feeling of hunger. CCK is key in suppressing hunger because of its role in inhibiting [[neuropeptide Y]]. [[Glucagon]] and [[epinephrine]] levels rise during fasting and stimulate hunger. [[Ghrelin]], a hormone produced by the stomach, is a hunger stimulant.&lt;ref name="Marieb, E. 2010 pp. 945-947"/&gt;

===Psychological factors===
Two psychological processes appear to be involved in regulating short-term food intake: liking and wanting. Liking refers to the palatability or taste of the food, which is reduced by repeated consumption. Wanting is the motivation to consume the food, which is also reduced by repeated consumption of a food&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Food reward: Brain substrates of wanting and liking|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/014976349500033B|journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|date = 1996-01-01|pages = 1–25|volume = 20|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/0149-7634(95)00033-B|first = Kent C.|last = Berridge|pmid=8622814}} {{update after|2018|8|19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be due to change in memory-related processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Habituation as a determinant of human food intake.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0015074|journal = Psychological Review|pmc = 2703585|pmid = 19348547|pages = 384–407|volume = 116|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/a0015074|first = Leonard H.|last = Epstein|first2 = Jennifer L.|last2 = Temple|first3 = James N.|last3 = Roemmich|first4 = Mark E.|last4 = Bouton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wanting can be triggered by a variety of psychological processes. Thoughts of a food may intrude on consciousness and be elaborated on, for instance, as when one sees a commercial or smells a desirable food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kavanagh|first=David J.|last2=Andrade|first2=Jackie|last3=May|first3=Jon|title=Imaginary Relish and Exquisite Torture: The Elaborated Intrusion Theory of Desire.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0033-295X.112.2.446|journal=Psychological Review|volume=112|issue=2|pages=446–467|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.112.2.446|pmid=15783293|date=Apr 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long-term regulation of hunger and food intake==
The regulation of hunger and appetite (the '''appestat''') has been the subject of much research; breakthroughs included the discovery, in 1994, of [[leptin]], a hormone produced by the [[adipose tissue]] that appeared to provide negative feedback. Leptin is a peptide hormone that affects homeostasis and immune responses.&lt;ref name="Wynne"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wynne |first=K |last2=Stanley |first2=S |last3=McGowan |first3=B |last4=Bloom |first4=S |date=February 2005 |title=Appetite Control |journal=Journal of Endocrinology |volume=184 |pages=291–318 |doi=10.1677/joe.1.05866 |pmid=15684339}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowering food intake can lower leptin levels in the body, while increasing the intake of food can raise leptin levels. Later studies showed that appetite regulation is an immensely complex process involving the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]], many [[hormone]]s, and both the [[central nervous system|central]] and [[autonomic nervous system]]s.&lt;ref name="Wynne" /&gt; The circulating gut hormones that regulate many pathways in the body can either stimulate or suppress appetite.&lt;ref name="pmid21949903"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Suzuki |first=K |last2=Jayasena |first2=CN |last3=Bloom |first3=SR |year=2011 |title=The Gut Hormones in Appetite Regulation |journal=Journal of Obesity |pages=1–10 |doi=10.1155/2011/528401 |pmid=21949903 |pmc=3178198 |id=Article id:528401 |volume=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example,  [[ghrelin]] stimulates appetite, whereas [[cholecystokinin]] and [[glucagon-like peptide-1]] (GLP-1) suppress appetite.&lt;ref name="pmid21949903" /&gt;

===Effector===
The [[arcuate nucleus]] of the  [[hypothalamus]], a part of the brain, is the main regulatory organ for the human appetite. Many brain [[neurotransmitter]]s affect appetite, especially [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]].&lt;ref name="pmid26549651"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Bojanowska E, Ciosek J | title=Can We Selectively Reduce Appetite for Energy-Dense Foods? An Overview of Pharmacological Strategies for Modification of Food Preference Behavior | journal= Current Neuropharmacology | volume=14 | issue=2 | pages=118–142 | year=2016 | PMID = 26549651 | doi=10.2174/1570159x14666151109103147| pmc=4825944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dopamine acts primarily through the reward centers of the brain,&lt;ref name="pmid26549651" /&gt; whereas serotonin primarily acts through effects on [[neuropeptide Y]] (NPY)/[[agouti-related peptide]] (AgRP) [stimulate appetite] and  [[proopiomelanocortin]] (POMC) [induce satiety] neurons located in the arcuate nucleus.&lt;ref name="pmid28979187 "&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Wyler SC, Lord CC, Lee S, Elmquist JK, Liu C | title=Serotonergic Control of Metabolic Homeostasis | journal= [[Frontiers Media|Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience]] | volume=11  | pages=277 | year=2017| url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2017.00277/full   | doi = 10.3389/fncel.2017.00277 | PMC= 5611374 | PMID = 28979187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the [[hormone]]s leptin and insulin suppress appetite through effects on AgRP and POMC neurons.&lt;ref name="pmid23146889"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Varela L, Horvath TL | title=Leptin and insulin pathways in POMC and AgRP neurons that modulate energy balance and glucose homeostasis | journal= [[EMBO Reports]] | volume=13 | issue = 12  | pages=1079–1086| year=2012 | url=http://embor.embopress.org/content/13/12/1079.long  | doi = 10.1038/embor.2012.174 | PMID = 23146889 | pmc=3512417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypothalamocortical and hypothalamolimbic projections contribute to the awareness of hunger, and the somatic processes controlled by the hypothalamus include [[vagus nerve|vagal]] tone (the activity of the [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] [[autonomic nervous system]]), stimulation of the [[thyroid]] ([[thyroxine]] regulates the metabolic rate), the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] and a large number of other mechanisms.  [[Opioid receptor]]-related processes in the [[nucleus accumbens]] and ventral [[pallidum]] affect the [[palatability]] of foods.&lt;ref name="Wassum"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wassum |first=KM |last2=Ostlund |first2=SB |last3=Maidment |first3=NT |last4=Balleine |first4=BW |year=2009 |title=Distinct opioid circuits determine the palatability and the desirability of rewarding events |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=106 |issue=30 |pages=12512–12517 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0905874106 |pmid=19597155 |pmc=2718390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is the area of the brain that coordinates [[neurotransmitter]], [[opioid]] and [[endocannabinoid]] signals to control feeding behaviour. The few important signalling molecules inside the NAc shell modulate the motivation to eat and the affective reactions for food. These molecules include the DA, Ach, opioids and cannabinoids and their action receptors inside the brain, DA, muscarinic and MOR and CB1 receptors respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fulton |first=S |journal=Front Neuroendocrinol |title=Appetite and Reward |year=2010 |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=85–103 |doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2009.10.003 |pmid=19822167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensor===
The hypothalamus senses external stimuli mainly through a number of hormones such as [[leptin]], [[ghrelin]], [[PYY 3-36]], [[orexin]] and [[cholecystokinin]]; all modify the hypothalamic response. They are produced by the digestive tract and by [[adipose tissue]] (leptin). Systemic mediators, such as [[tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] (TNFα), [[interleukin]]s 1 and 6 and [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH) influence appetite negatively; this mechanism explains why ill people often eat less.

Leptin, a hormone secreted exclusively by [[adipose cells]] in response to an increase in body fat mass, is an important component in the regulation of long term hunger and food intake. Leptin serves as the brain's indicator of the body's total energy stores. When leptin levels rise in the bloodstream they bind to receptors in [[Arc (protein)|ARC]]. The functions of leptin are to:

* Suppress the release of [[neuropeptide Y]] (NPY), which in turn prevents the release of appetite enhancing [[orexins]] from the [[lateral hypothalamus]]. This decreases appetite and food intake, promoting weight loss.
* Stimulate the expression of [[cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript]] (CART).
Though rising blood levels of leptin do promote weight loss to some extent, its main role is to protect the body against weight loss in times of nutritional deprivation. Other factors also have been shown to effect long-term hunger and food intake regulation including insulin.&lt;ref name="Marieb, E. 2010 pp. 945-947"/&gt;

In addition, the [[Circadian cycle|biological clock]] (which is regulated by the hypothalamus) stimulates hunger. Processes from other cerebral loci, such as from the [[limbic system]] and the [[cerebral cortex]], project on the hypothalamus and modify appetite. This explains why in [[clinical depression]] and [[stress (medicine)|stress]], energy intake can change quite drastically.

===Set-point theories of hunger and [[eating]]===
The [[Set point (medicine)|set-point]] theories of hunger and eating are a group of theories developed in the 1940s and 1950s that operate under the assumption that hunger is the result of an energy deficit and that eating is a means by which energy resources are returned to their optimal level, or energy set-point. According to this assumption, a person's energy resources are thought to be at or near their set-point soon after eating, and are thought to decline after that. Once the person's energy levels fall below a certain threshold, the sensation of hunger is experienced, which is the body's way of motivating the person to eat again. The set-point assumption is a [[negative feedback]] mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wenning | first1 = A | year = 1990 | title = Sensing effectors make sense | doi = 10.1016/s0166-2236(99)01467-8 | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 550–555 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two popular set-point theories include the [[glucostatic set-point theory]] and the [[lipostatic set-point theory]].&lt;/span&gt;

The set-point theories of hunger and eating present a number of weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Castro | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Plunkett | first2 = S. | year = 2002 | title = A general model of intake regulation | url = | journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 581–595 | doi=10.1016/s0149-7634(02)00018-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/span&gt;

*The current epidemic of obesity and other eating disorders undermines these theories.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pinel, J. P. J., Biopsychology, 6th ed. 293-294. {{ISBN|0-205-42651-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The set-point theories of hunger and eating are inconsistent with basic evolutionary pressures related to hunger and eating as they are currently understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pinel | first1 = J.

*Major predictions of the set-point theories of hunger and eating have not been confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lowe | first1 = M.

The [[Positive-incentive value|positive-incentive]] perspective is an umbrella term for a set of theories presented as an alternative to the set-point theories of hunger and eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berridge | first1 = K. C. | year = 2004 | title = Motivation concepts in behavioral neuroscience | url = | journal = Physiology and Behavior | volume = 81 | issue = | pages = 179–209 | doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2004.02.004 | pmid=15159167}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central assertion to the positive-incentive perspective is the idea that humans and other animals are not normally motivated to eat by energy deficits, but are instead motivated to eat by the anticipated pleasure of eating, or the positive-incentive value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Booth | first1 = D. A. | year = 1981 | title = The physiology of appetite | url = | journal = British Medical Bulletin | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 135–140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this perspective, eating is controlled in much the same way as sexual behavior. Humans engage in sexual behavior, not because of an internal deficit, but instead because they have evolved to crave it. Similarly, the evolutionary pressures of unexpected food shortages have shaped humans and all other warm blooded animals to take advantage of food when it is present. It is the presence of good food, or the mere anticipation of it that makes one hungry.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Premeal hunger==
Prior to consuming a meal, the body's energy reserves are in reasonable homeostatic balance. However, when a meal is consumed, there is a homeostasis-disturbing influx of fuels into the bloodstream. When the usual mealtime approaches, the body takes steps to soften the impact of the homeostasis-disturbing influx of fuels by releasing insulin into the blood, and lowering the [[blood glucose]] levels. It is this lowering of blood glucose levels that causes premeal hunger, and not necessarily an energy deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woods | first1 = S. C. | year = 1991 | title = The eating paradox: How we tolerate food | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 98 | issue = | pages = 488–505 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.98.4.488}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woods | first1 = S. C. | year = 2004 | title = Lessons in the interaction of hormones and ingestive behavior | url = | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 82 | issue = 1| pages = 187–190 | doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2004.04.050}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woods | first1 = S.

==Similar conditions==
A [[food craving]] is an intense desire to consume a specific food, as opposed to general hunger. Similarly, [[thirst]] is the craving for water.&lt;ref name="Ronzio"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Nutrition and Good Health |article=Craving |page=176 |publisher=Facts on File |first=Robert A. |last=Ronzio | name-list-format = vanc  |edition=2nd |year=2003 |isbn=0-8160-4966-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Immunization Alliance''' is an [[United States|American]] [[vaccine]] advocacy consortium, assembled under auspices of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) in May 2008. The Immunization Alliance has called for a governmental information campaign, ongoing research into vaccine safety and efficacy, balanced media coverage, and restoration of confidence among parents due to the [[vaccine controversy]] and the related [[controversies in autism]].

==Emergence==

Citing the largest [[measles]] outbreak in the US since 1966 (130 cases in fifteen states), [[Paul Offit]], a member of the Alliance, asserted that this re-emergence of a common childhood disease was a warning about the dangers of "what can happen when parents are misinformed about vaccine safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antivaccine Movement: History, Current Effects on Immunization|url=http://www.healio.com/pediatrics/vaccine-preventable-diseases/news/online/%7B362db6d7-634c-4422-ba39-9155e2935d90%7D/antivaccine-movement-history-current-effects-on-immunization|work=Healio.com|publisher=SLACK Inc.|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We do not want to become a nation of people who are vulnerable to diseases that are deadly or that can have serious complications, especially if those diseases can be prevented," said [[Renee Jenkins]], president of the AAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

The Immunization Alliance was described in the July, 2008, issue of ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'' (published by the AAP), announcing the organization's debut and detailing its plans for improving [[vaccine schedule]] adherence and combating declining [[immunization]] rates.

'''Leona Baumgartner''' (August 18, 1902 – January 15, 1991)&lt;ref name=SSDI&gt;{{cite web|title=Leon Baumgartner|url=http://www.americanancestors.org/PageDetail.aspx?recordId=75415092|work=Social Security Death Index|publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society|accessdate=May 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American physician. She was the first woman to serve as Commissioner of New York City’s Department of Health (1954–1962). She was a strong advocate of health education and a pioneer in promoting health services among New York’s immigrant and poverty-stricken population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HMS.Count:med00122 Leona Baumgartner Papers], 1837–1993 (inclusive), 1930–1970 (bulk), H MS c305. Harvard Medical Library, Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine, Boston, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leona Baumgartner was born in 1902 to Olga and William Baumgartner. She earned her B.A in [[Bacteriology]] and M.A in [[Immunology]] at the [[University of Kansas]] where her father was a professor of zoology. She was a member of the Kansas Alpha chapter of [[Pi Beta Phi]], and was the 1933-34 winner of the Pi Beta Phi Graduate Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;''The Arrow of Pi Beta Phi'', November 1933, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Moving onto [[Yale University]], Baumgartner received her Ph.D. in [[Public Health]] in 1934 and received her M.D. the same year.

From 1934–1936, she interned in [[Pediatrics]] at New York City Hospital. It was during this time, in depression-era New York, that Baumgartner began making home visits in the city’s poorest areas. In 1937, she joined New York’s Department of Health as a medical instructor in Child and School Hygiene. In 1939, Baumgartner was promoted to district health officer, where she managed a number of health services including school health programs, parenting classes and clinics on venereal disease.

In 1954, Baumgartner was appointed Commissioner of Health of New York City. In addition to revising the city’s health code, she also implemented routine inspections of the city’s many restaurant kitchens, slaughterhouses and day-care facilities. She was instrumental in garnering funding for public health research and a premature childcare facility. Following in the work of [[Sara Josephine Baker]], Baumgartner sought to increase public knowledge of health issues through a series of radio and television broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/17/obituaries/dr-leona-baumgartner-88-dies-led-new-york-health-department.html Dr. Leona Baumgartner, 88, Dies; Led New York Health Department]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 1956, she assisted Dr. Harold Fuerst in the inoculation of the then 21 year old [[Elvis Presley]], an event witnessed by the entire world press with bureaus   in New York City,  carried  live on all three networks and which   resulted  in the exponential increase in the  polio immunization of all Americans from 0.6%,   the prevailing rate on the previous day,  to 80%  by April 1957.

As the years went by, maternal and child health remained a constant concern throughout her career and informed her decision to promote family planning practices and birth control. In 1962, she was appointed by President [[John F. Kennedy]] to head the Office of Technical Cooperation and Research at the [[United States Agency for International Development]]. Under the Johnson administration she fought to 
overturn policies that prevented the inclusion of birth control in the agency’s health programs. She is credited with convincing President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] to reverse policy on funding for international programs that provided birth control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_28.html Changing the Face of Medicine: Dr. Leona Baumgartner.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Baumgartner accepted a position as a visiting professor at [[Harvard Medical School]]. She remained at this post until her retirement in 1972. During the same years, she also served as Executive Director of the Medical Care and Education Foundation.

Throughout her career, Baumgartner was dedicated to health education as the cornerstone to the creation of a healthy community, beginning with her work as district health officer in planning classes and clinics. Baumgartner was also an early advocate of the vaccine developed by [[Jonas Salk]] as a method of immunization against [[polio]] and the fluoridation of water as a bulwark against dental disease.&lt;ref name=Iacono&gt;{{cite news|last1=Iacono|first1=Michael Dello|title=Leona Baumgartner papers, 1830-1979, open for research|url=https://cms.www.countway.harvard.edu/wp/?tag=new-york-city-department-of-public-health|accessdate=16 October 2014|work=CHoM News|agency=Center for the History of Medicine|date=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baumgartner was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1969.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=May 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was awarded the [[Public Welfare Medal]] from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1977.&lt;ref name=PWM&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Welfare Medal |url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_pwm |work=National Academy of Sciences |accessdate=May 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604024100/http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_pwm |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her other awards include the Sedgwick Medal, the [[Mary Woodard Lasker Award for Public Service|Albert Lasker Public Service Award]], the Elizabeth Blackwell Award, and the Samuel J. Crumbine Award. In 1942, Baumgartner married Nathaniel Elias, a chemical engineer. The marriage lasted until Elias’ death in 1964; in 1970, Baumgartner married Dr. [[Alexander Langmuir]] who survived her death in 1991 from [[polycythemia]] by two years.

The '''linear no-threshold model''' ('''LNT''') is a model used in [[radiation protection]] to quantify radiation exposure and set regulatory limits. It is most frequently used to calculate the probability of [[radiation induced cancer]] at both high doses where [[epidemiology]] studies support its application but, controversially, it likewise finds applications in calculating the effects of low doses, a dose region that is fraught with much less [[statistical significance|statistical confidence]] in its predictive power but that nonetheless has resulted in major personal and policy decisions in regards to [[public health]]. The model assumes that the long-term, biological damage caused by [[ionizing radiation]] (essentially the cancer risk) is directly proportional to the [[Effective dose (radiation)|dose]]. This allows the summation by [[dosimeter]]s of all radiation exposure, without taking into consideration dose levels or dose rates.&lt;ref&gt;"In the absence of more conclusive data, scientists have assumed that even the smallest radiation exposure carries a risk." [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/rc00152.pdf GAO study]&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, radiation is always considered harmful with no safety threshold, and the sum of several very small exposures are considered to have the same effect as one larger exposure (response linearity).

One of the organizations for establishing recommendations on radiation protection guidelines internationally, the [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation|UNSCEAR]], recommended in 2014 policies that do not agree with the Linear No-Threshold model at exposure levels below background levels of radiation to the UN General Assembly from the Fifty-Ninth Session of the Committee. Its recommendation states that "the Scientific Committee does not recommend multiplying very low doses by large numbers of individuals to estimate numbers of radiation-induced health effects within a population exposed to incremental doses at levels equivalent to or lower than natural background levels." This is a reversal from previous recommendations by the same organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/V12/553/85/PDF/V1255385.pdf?OpenElement |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805144608/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/V12/553/85/PDF/V1255385.pdf?OpenElement |archivedate=5 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }} UNSCEAR Fifty-Ninth Session 21–25 May 2012 | Published 14 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three active (2016) challenges to the LNT model currently being considered by the US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]. One was filed by [[Nuclear Medicine]] Professor Carol Marcus of [[UCLA]], who calls the LNT model scientific "baloney".&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-a-little-radiation-so-bad-1471014742  Is a Little Dose of Radiatoion So Bad?], ''Wall Street Journal'', Aug 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the model describes the reality for small-dose exposures is disputed. It opposes two competing schools of thought: the [[threshold model]], which assumes that very small exposures are harmless, and the [[radiation hormesis]] model, which claims that radiation at very small doses can be beneficial. Because the current data are inconclusive, scientists disagree on which model should be used. Pending any definitive answer to these questions and the [[precautionary principle]], the model is sometimes used to quantify the cancerous effect of [[collective dose]]s of low-level radioactive contaminations, even though it estimates a positive number of excess deaths at levels that would have had zero deaths, or saved lives, in the two other models. Such practice has been condemned by the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%20103 ICRP publication 103], §66&lt;/ref&gt;

The LNT model is sometimes applied to other cancer hazards such as [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s in drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/safewater/contaminants/dw_contamfs/pcbs.html  ''Consumer Factsheet on: polychlorinated biphenyls'']  US Environment Protection Agency.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Increased risk with dose.svg|thumb|right|Increased Risk of Solid Cancer with Dose for [[Hibakusha|A-bomb survivors]], from BEIR report. Notably this exposure pathway occurred from essentially a massive spike or pulse of radiation, a result of the brief instant that the bomb exploded, which while somewhat similar to the environment of a [[CT scan]], it is wholly unlike the low ''[[dose rate]]'' of living in a contaminated area such as [[Chernobyl]], were the ''dose rate'' is orders of magnitude smaller. However LNT does not consider [[dose rate]] and is an unsubstantiated [[one size fits all]] approach based solely on total [[absorbed dose]]. When the two environments and cell effects are vastly different. Likewise, it has also been pointed out that bomb survivors inhaled carcinogenic [[benzopyrene]] from the burning cities, yet this is not factored in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Radiology|date=April 2009 |volume= 251|issue=1|pages= 13–22|doi= 10.1148/radiol.2511080671|pmid=19332842 |pmc= 2663584|title=The Linear No-Threshold Relationship Is Inconsistent with Radiation Biologic and Experimental Data|last1=Tubiana |first1=M. |last2=Feinendegen |first2=L. E. |last3=Yang |first3=C. |last4=Kaminski |first4=J. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The association of exposure to radiation with cancer had been observed as early as 1902, six years after the discovery of [[X-ray]] by [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] and [[radioactivity]] by [[Henri Becquerel]].&lt;ref name="kathren"&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://scholars.unh.edu/unh_lr/vol1/iss1/5/|journal=University of New Hampshire Law Review |volume= 1|issue= 1|date=December 2002 |title=Historical Development of the Linear Nonthreshold Dose-Response Model as Applied to Radiation|author=Ronald L. Kathren }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, [[Hermann Joseph Muller|Hermann Muller]] demonstrated that radiation may cause genetic mutation and suggested that the mutation rate may be related to dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Muller - Nobel Lecture|date= December 12, 1946|work=Nobel Prize}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early studies were based on relatively high levels of radiation that made it hard to establish the safety of low level of radiation, and many scientists at that time believed that there may be a tolerance level, and that low doses of radiation may not be harmful. A later study in 1955 on mice exposed to low dose of radiation suggest that they may outlive control animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Long-Term Effects of Acute and Chronic Irradiation in Mice. I. Survival and Tumor Incidence Following Chronic Irradiation of 0.11 r Per Day|authors=Egon Lorenz  Joanne Weikel Hollcroft  Eliza Miller  Charles C. Congdon Robert Schweisthal |journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute|volume= 15|issue= 4|date= 1 February 1955 |pages= 1049–1058|doi=10.1093/jnci/15.4.1049 |pmid= 13233949}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interest in the effect of radiation intensified after the dropping of atomic bombs on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], and studies were conducted on the survivors. Although compelling evidence on the effect of low dosage of radiation was hard to come by, by the late 1940s, the idea of LNT became more popular due to its mathematical simplicity.  In 1954, the [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] (NCRP) introduced the concept of maximum permissible dose. In 1958, [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] (UNSCEAR) assessed the LNT model and a threshold model, but noted the difficulty in acquiring "reliable information about the correlation between small doses and their effects either in individuals or in large populations". The [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy]] (JCAE) similarly could not establish if there is a threshold or "safe" level for exposure, nevertheless it introduced the concept of "[[ALARP|As Low As Reasonably Achievable]]" (ALARA). ALARA would become a fundamental principle in radiation protection policy that implicitly accepts the validity of LNT.  In 1959, United States Federal Radiation Council (FRC) supported the concept of the LNT extrapolation down to the low dose region in its first report.&lt;ref name="kathren"/&gt; 

By the 1970s, the LNT model had become accepted as the standard in radiation protection practice by a number of bodies.&lt;ref name="kathren"/&gt;  In 1972, the first report of National Academy of Sciences (NAS) [[Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation]] (BEIR), an expert panel who reviewed available peer reviewed literature, supported the LNT model on pragmatic grounds, noting that while "dose-effect relationship for x rays and gamma rays may not be a linear function", the "use of linear extrapolation . . . may be justified on pragmatic grounds as a basis for risk estimation." In its seventh report of 2006, NAS BEIR VII writes, "the committee concludes that the preponderance of information indicates that there will be some risk, even at low doses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/reports-in-brief/beir_vii_final.pdf |title=Beir VII: Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation |work= The National Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radiation precautions and public policy==
{{See also|Health effects of sun exposure}}
Radiation precautions have led to [[sunlight]] being listed as a carcinogen at all sun exposure rates, due to the [[ultraviolet]] component of sunlight, with no safe level of sunlight exposure being suggested, following the precautionary LNT model. According to a 2007 study submitted by the University of Ottawa to the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., there is not enough information to determine a safe level of sun exposure at this time.&lt;ref name="ODS-sheet-ref-5"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Cranney A, Horsley T, O'Donnell S, etal |title=Effectiveness and safety of vitamin D in relation to bone health |journal=Evidence Report/technology Assessment |volume= |issue=158 |pages=1–235 |date=August 2007 |pmid=18088161 |pmc=4781354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a particular dose of radiation is found to produce one extra case of a type of cancer in every thousand people exposed, LNT projects that one thousandth of this dose will produce one extra case in every million people so exposed, and that one millionth of the original dose will produce one extra case in every billion people exposed. The conclusion is that any given [[dose equivalent]] of radiation will produce the same number of cancers, no matter how thinly it is spread.

The model is simple to apply: a quantity of radiation can be translated into a number of deaths without any adjustment for the distribution of exposure, including the distribution of exposure within a single exposed individual. For example, a [[hot particle]] embedded in an organ (such as lung) results in a very high dose in the cells directly adjacent to the [[hot particle]], but a much lower whole-organ and whole-body dose. Thus, even if a safe low dose threshold was found to exist at cellular level for radiation induced [[mutagenesis]], the threshold would not exist for environmental pollution with hot particles, and could not be safely assumed to exist when the distribution of dose is unknown.

The linear no-threshold model is used to extrapolate the expected number of extra deaths caused by exposure to [[environmental radiation]], and it therefore has a great impact on [[public policy]]. The model is used to translate any [[radiation release]], like that from a "[[dirty bomb]]", into a number of lives lost, while any reduction in [[Ionizing radiation|radiation exposure]], for example as a consequence of [[radon]] detection, is translated into a number of lives saved. When the doses are very low, at natural background levels, in the absence of evidence, the model predicts via extrapolation, new cancers only in a very small fraction of the population, but for a large population, the number of lives is extrapolated into hundreds or thousands, and this can sway public policy.

A linear model has long been used in [[health physics]] to set maximum acceptable radiation exposures.

The United States-based [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] (NCRP), a body commissioned by the [[United States Congress]], recently released a report written by the national experts in the field which states that, radiation's effects should be considered to be proportional to the dose an individual receives, regardless of how small the dose is.

A 1958 analysis of two decades of research on the mutation rate of 1 million lab mice showed that six major hypotheses about ionizing radiation and gene mutation were not supported by data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/128/3338/1546.long |title=Radiation dose rate and mutation frequency. |author=Russell WL, Russell LB, Kelly EM.|journal= Science|date= December 19, 1958 |volume=128|issue=3338|pages=1546–50 |pmid=13615306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its data was used in 1972 by the [[Committee on the Biological Effects of lonizing Radiation|Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation I]] committee to support the LNT model. However, it has been claimed that the data contained a fundamental error that was not revealed to the committee, and would not support the LNT model on the issue of mutations and may suggest a threshold dose ''rate'' under which radiation does not produce any mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://phys.org/news/2017-01-calabrese-lnt-toxicology.html |title=Calabrese says mistake led to adopting the LNT model in toxicology |date=January 23, 2017 |work=Phys.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Edward J. Calabrese|title=The threshold vs LNT showdown: Dose rate findings exposed flaws in the LNT model part 2.

==Fieldwork==
The LNT model and the alternatives to it each have plausible mechanisms that could bring them about, but definitive conclusions are hard to make given the difficulty of doing [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] studies involving large [[Cohort (statistics)|cohorts]] over long periods.

A 2003 review of the various studies published in the authoritative  ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' concludes that "given our current state of knowledge, the most reasonable assumption is that the cancer risks from low doses of x- or gamma-rays decrease linearly with decreasing dose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Brenner  | first =David J  | title =Cancer risks attributable to low doses of ionizing radiation: Assessing what we really know  | journal =[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]  | volume =100  | issue =24  | pages =13761–6  | date =10 November 2003  | url =http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/100/24/13761  | doi =10.1073/pnas.2235592100  | id =  | accessdate =29 August 2007  | pmid =14610281  | pmc =283495 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study by researchers that looks at Swedish children exposed to fallout from [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] while they were fetuses between 8 and 25 weeks gestation concluded that the reduction in [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] at very low doses was greater than expected, given a simple LNT model for radiation damage, indicating that the LNT model may be too conservative when it comes to neurological damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Douglas |last=Almond |first2=Lena |last2=Edlund |first3=Mårten |last3=Palme |title=Chernobyl's Subclinical Legacy: Prenatal Exposure to Radioactive Fallout and School Outcomes in Sweden |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=124 |issue=4 |year=2009 |pages=1729–1772 |doi=10.1162/qjec.2009.124.4.1729 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in medical journals, studies detail that in Sweden in the year of the Chernobyl accident, the [[birth rate]], both increased and shifted to those of "higher [[maternal age]]" in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Odlind |first1=V |last2=Ericson |first2=A |title=Incidence of legal abortion in Sweden after the Chernobyl accident |journal=Biomedicine &amp; Pharmacotherapy |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=225–8 |year=1991 |pmid=1912377 |doi=10.1016/0753-3322(91)90021-k}}&lt;/ref&gt; More advanced maternal age in Swedish mothers was linked with a reduction in offspring IQ, in a paper published in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mikko |last=Myrskylä |first2=Karri |last2=Silventoinen |first3=Per |last3=Tynelius |first4=Finn |last4=Rasmussen |title=Is Later Better or Worse?

The doses examined varied between 0 and 500 mSv received over their working lives. These results exclude the possibilities of no increase in risk or that the risk is 2-3 times that for A-bomb survivors with a confidence level of 90%. The cancer risk for these radiation workers was still less than the average for persons in the UK due to the [[healthy worker effect]].

A 2009 study focusing on the naturally high background radiation region of [[Karunagappalli]], India concluded: "our cancer incidence study, together with previously reported cancer mortality studies in the HBR area of [[Yangjiang]], China, suggests it is unlikely that estimates of risk at low doses are substantially greater than currently believed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nair | first1 = R.

In 2011 an ''in vitro'' time-lapse study of the cellular response to low doses of radiation showed a strongly non-linear response of certain cellular repair mechanisms called radiation-induced foci (RIF). The study found that low doses of radiation prompted higher rates of RIF formation than high doses, and that after low-dose exposure RIF continued to form after the radiation had ended.&lt;ref name="pmid22184222"&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Neumaier  | first =Teresa  | title =Evidence for formation of DNA repair centers and dose-response nonlinearity in human cells  | journal =[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]  | volume =109  | issue =2  | date =19 December 2011  | url =http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/12/16/1117849108.full.pdf+html  | doi =10.1073/pnas.1117849108  | accessdate =20 December 2011  | pmid=22184222  | pmc=3258602  | pages=443–448|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors conclude that their results were generally consistent with the linear no threshold theory.

==Controversy==
The LNT model has been contested by a number of scientists.  It is been claimed that the early proponent of the model [[Hermann Joseph Muller]] intentionally ignored an early study that did not support the LNT model when he gave his 1946 Nobel Prize address advocating the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Calabrese, E. J.| title = Muller's Nobel lecture on dose–response for ionizing radiation:ideology or science?| date = 30 June 2011| url =http://users.physics.harvard.edu/~wilson/freshman_seminar/Radiation/Calabrese-Muller-1-1.pdf| accessdate =30 December 2011| doi = 10.1007/s00204-011-0728-8| journal = Archives of Toxicology| volume = 85| issue = 4| pages = 1495–1498| pmid=21717110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also argued that LNT model had caused an irrational fear of radiation.  In the wake of the 1986 [[Chernobyl accident]] in [[Ukraine]], Europe-wide anxieties were formented in pregnant mothers over the perception enforced by the LNT model that their children would be born with a higher rate of mutations.&lt;ref name="kasperson160"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kasperson |first1=Roger E. |last2=Stallen |first2=Pieter Jan M. |title=Communicating Risks to the Public: International Perspectives |publisher=Springer Science and Media |year=1991|location=Berlin |pages=160–2 |isbn=978-0-7923-0601-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As far afield as the country of [[Denmark]], hundreds of excess [[induced abortions]] were performed on the healthy unborn, out of this no-threshold fear.&lt;ref name="autogenerated443"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5271/sjweh.1761 |title=The Chernobyl accident and induced abortions: Only one-way information |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment &amp; Health |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=443–4 |year=1990 |last1=Perucchi |first1=M |last2=Domenighetti |first2=G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the accident however, studies of data sets approaching a million births in the [[EUROCAT (medicine)|EUROCAT]] database, divided into "exposed" and control groups were assessed in 1999. As no Chernobyl impacts were detected, the researchers conclude "in retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn was not justified".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ije/28.5.941 |pmid=10597995 |title=Evaluation of the impact of Chernobyl on the prevalence of congenital anomalies in 16 regions of Europe.

In [[Radiation therapy#Effects on reproduction|very high dose radiation therapy]], it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies, however, human exposure data and animal testing suggests that the "malformation of organs appears to be a [[deterministic effect]] with a [[Dose–response relationship|threshold dose]]" below which, no rate increase is observed.&lt;ref name="ecolo.org"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(sici)1096-9926(199908)60:2&lt;100::aid-tera14&gt;3.3.co;2-8 |pmid=10440782 |title=Teratogen update: Radiation and chernobyl |journal=Teratology |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=100–6 |year=1999 |last1=Castronovo |first1=Frank P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in 1999 on the link between the Chernobyl accident and [[teratology]] (birth defects) concludes that "there is no substantive proof regarding radiation‐induced teratogenic effects from the Chernobyl accident".&lt;ref name="ecolo.org"/&gt; It is argued that the human body has defense mechanisms, such as [[DNA repair]] and [[programmed cell death]], that would protect it against carcinogenesis due to low-dose exposures of carcinogens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://schachtmanlaw.com/the-mythology-of-linear-no-threshold-cancer-causation/ The Mythology of Linear No-Threshold Cancer Causation]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ramsar, Mazandaran|Ramsar]], located in [[Iran]], is often quoted as being a counter example to LNT. Based on preliminary results, it was considered as having the highest natural background radiation levels on Earth, several times higher than the [[ICRP]]-recommended radiation dose limits for radiation workers, whilst the local population did not seem to suffer any ill effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/mo/radioadaptive/ramsar.html High Background Radiation Areas of Ramsar, Iran], S.

A 2011 research of the cellular repair mechanisms support the evidence against the linear no-threshold model.&lt;ref name="pmid22184222" /&gt;  According to its authors, this study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America "casts considerable doubt on the general assumption that risk to ionizing radiation is proportional to dose".

However, a 2011 review of studies addressing childhood leukaemia following exposure to ionizing radiation, including both diagnostic exposure and natural background exposure, concluded that existing risk factors, excess relative risk per Sv (ERR/Sv), is "broadly applicable" to low dose or low dose-rate exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Richard Wakeford| title = The risk of childhood leukaemia following exposure to ionising radiation – a review| date = 30 June 2011| journal = Journal of Radiological Protection (in Press, but Not Yet Public)| volume = 33| issue = 1| pages = 1–25| doi = 10.1088/0952-4746/33/1/1| pmid = 23296257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several expert scientific panels have been convened on the accuracy of the LNT model at low dosage, and various organizations and bodies have stated their positions on this topic:
; Support
* In 2004 the [[United States National Research Council]] (part of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]) supported the linear no threshold model and stated regarding [[Radiation hormesis]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/catalog/11340.html Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation: BEIR VII Phase 2]. Books.nap.edu. Retrieved on 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hps.org/newsandevents/newsarchive/oldnews497.html Society News Archive: BEIR VII Report Supports LNT Model]. Hps.org.

Retrieved on 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The assumption that any stimulatory hormetic effects from low doses of ionizing radiation will have a significant health benefit to humans that exceeds potential detrimental effects from the radiation exposure is unwarranted at this time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* In 2005 the United States National Academies' National Research Council published its comprehensive meta-analysis of low-dose radiation research BEIR VII, Phase 2. In its press release the Academies stated:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=11340 NAS. Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation May Cause Harm. Press Release, 29 June 2005. Retrieved on 17 December 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The scientific research base shows that there is no threshold of exposure below which low levels of ionizing radiation can be demonstrated to be harmless or beneficial.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* The [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] (a body commissioned by the [[United States Congress]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncrppublications.org/index.cfm?fm=Product.AddToCart&amp;pid=6714063164 NCRP report]. Ncrppublications.org. Retrieved on 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed the LNT model in a 2001 report that attempted to survey existing literature critical of the model.
* The [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] (UNSCEAR) wrote in its 2000 report&lt;ref&gt;UNSCEAR 2000 REPORT Vol. II: Sources and Effects of Ionizing Radiation: Annex G: Biological effects at low radiation doses. page 160, paragraph 541. Available online at [http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/annexg.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Until the [...] uncertainties on low-dose response are resolved, the Committee believes that an increase in the risk of tumour induction proportionate to the radiation dose is consistent with developing knowledge and that it remains, accordingly, the most scientifically defensible approximation of low-dose response. However, a strictly linear dose response should not be expected in all circumstances.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] also endorses the LNT model in its 2011 report on radiogenic cancer risk:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-05/documents/bbfinalversion.pdf |title=EPA Radiogenic Cancer Risk Models and Projections for the U.S. Population |publisher=EPA |date=April 2011 |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Underlying the risk models is a large body of epidemiological and radiobiological data. In general, results from both lines of research are consistent with a linear, no-threshold dose (LNT) response model in which the risk of inducing a cancer in an irradiated tissue by low doses of radiation is proportional to the dose to that tissue.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Oppose
A number of organisations disagree with using the Linear no-threshold model to estimate risk from environmental and occupational low-level radiation exposure:

* The [[French Academy of Sciences]] (''Académie des Sciences'') and the National Academy of Medicine (''[[Académie Nationale de Médecine]]'') published a report in 2005 (at the same time as BEIR VII report in the United States) that rejected the Linear no-threshold model in favor of a threshold dose response and a significantly reduced risk at low radiation exposure:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Heyes| title = Authors' reply| date = 1 October 2006| url = http://bjr.birjournals.org/cgi/content/citation/79/946/855| accessdate =27 March 2008| doi = 10.1259/bjr/52126615| journal = British Journal of Radiology| volume = 79| issue = 946| pages = 855–857|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Aurengo| title = Dose-effect relationships and estimation of the carcinogenic effects of low doses of ionizing radiation.| publisher = Académie des Sciences &amp; Académie nationale de Médecine| date = 30 March 2005| url = http://www.radscihealth.org/rsh/Papers/FrenchAcadsFinal07_04_05.pdf| accessdate = 27 March 2008| display-authors = etal| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725061127/http://www.radscihealth.org/rsh/Papers/FrenchAcadsFinal07_04_05.pdf| archivedate = 25 July 2011| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In conclusion, this report raises doubts on the validity of using LNT for evaluating the carcinogenic risk of low doses (&lt; 100 mSv) and even more for very low doses (&lt; 10 mSv). The LNT concept can be a useful pragmatic tool for assessing rules in radioprotection for doses above 10 mSv;  however since it is not based on biological concepts of our current knowledge, it should not be used without precaution for assessing by extrapolation the risks associated with low and even more so, with very low doses (&lt; 10 mSv), especially for benefit-risk assessments imposed on radiologists by the European directive 97-43.}}

* The [[Health Physics Society]]'s position statement first adopted in January 1996, as revised in July 2010, states:&lt;ref&gt;Health Physics Society, 2010. Radiation Risk in Perspective  '''PS010-2''' [http://hps.org/documents/risk_ps010-2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In accordance with current knowledge of radiation health risks, the Health Physics Society recommends against quantitative estimation of health risks below an individual dose of 5 rem (50 mSv)  in one year or a lifetime dose of 10 rem (100 mSv) above that received from natural sources. Doses from natural background radiation in the United States average about 0.3 rem (3 mSv) per year. A dose of 5 rem (50 mSv) will be accumulated in the first 17 years of life and about 25 rem (250 mSv) in a lifetime of 80 years. Estimation of health risk associated with radiation doses that are of similar magnitude as those received from natural sources should be strictly qualitative and encompass a range of hypothetical health outcomes, including the possibility of no adverse health effects at such low levels.}}

* The [[American Nuclear Society]] recommended further research on the Linear No Threshold Hypothesis before making adjustments to current radiation protection guidelines, concurring with the Health Physics Society's position that:&lt;ref&gt;The American Nuclear Society, 2001. Health Effects of Low-Level Radiation. Position Statement '''41''' [http://www.ans.org/pi/ps/docs/ps41.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;   {{quote|There is substantial and convincing scientific evidence for health risks at high dose. Below 10 rem or 100 mSv (which includes occupational and environmental exposures) risks of health effects are either too small to be observed or are non-existent.}}

;Intermediate
The US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] takes the intermediate position that "accepts the LNT hypothesis as a conservative model for estimating radiation risk", but noting that "public health data do not absolutely establish the occurrence of cancer following exposure to low doses and dose rates — below about 10,000 mrem (100 mSv). Studies of occupational workers who are chronically exposed to low levels of radiation above normal background have shown no adverse biological effects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/radiation/health-effects/rad-exposure-cancer.html |title=Radiation Exposure and Cancer |date=29 March 2012 |website=[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] |accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health effects==
{{Further|Radiophobia}}
The consequences of low-level radiation are often more [[psychological]] than radiological. Because damage from very-low-level radiation cannot be detected, people exposed to it are left in anguished uncertainty about what will happen to them. Many believe they have been fundamentally contaminated for life and may refuse to have children for fear of [[birth defect]]s. They may be shunned by others in their community who fear a sort of mysterious contagion.&lt;ref name=riv12&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/10/nuclear-risk-and-fear-from-hiroshima-to-fukushima/ |title=Nuclear Risk and Fear, from Hiroshima to Fukushima |author=[[Andrew C. Revkin]] |date=10 March 2012 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced evacuation from a radiation or nuclear accident may lead to social isolation, anxiety, depression, psychosomatic medical problems, reckless behavior, even suicide. Such was the outcome of the 1986 [[Chernobyl nuclear disaster]] in the Ukraine. A comprehensive 2005 study concluded that "the mental health impact of Chernobyl is the largest public health problem unleashed by the accident to date".&lt;ref name=riv12/&gt; [[Frank N. von Hippel]], a U.S. scientist, commented on the 2011 [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], saying that "fear of ionizing radiation could have long-term psychological effects on a large portion of the population in the contaminated areas".&lt;ref name="Frank N. von Hippel 27–36"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/5/27.full |title=The radiological and psychological consequences of the Fukushima Daiichi accident |author= Frank N. von Hippel |date= September–October 2011|volume=67|issue=5 |work= Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |pages= 27–36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such great psychological danger does not accompany other materials that put people at risk of cancer and other deadly illness. Visceral fear is not widely aroused by, for example, the daily emissions from coal burning, although, as a National Academy of Sciences study found, this causes 10,000 premature deaths a year in the US. It is "only nuclear radiation that bears a huge psychological burden — for it carries a unique historical legacy".&lt;ref name=riv12/&gt;

The Permanent Delegation is located at New Zealand's consulate-general in Vienna.  New Zealand has maintained a resident [[Permanent Representative]] to the UN in Vienna since 1982.  Until 1991, the Permanent Representative was [[Dual accreditation|concurrently accredited]] as the [[List of Ambassadors from New Zealand to Austria|Ambassador to Austria]].  However, with the closing of the [[bilateralism|bilateral]] mission in that year, and its transfer to [[Bonn]], in [[Germany]], the position of Permanent Representative was separated.

'''Louise Bates Ames''' (29 October 1908 – 31 October 1996) was an American psychologist specializing in [[child development]].&lt;ref name="JamesJames"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julia Grant|author2=Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study|editor=Edward T. James |editor2=Janet Wilson James |editor3=Paul S. Boyer|title=Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSaMu4F06AQC&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=9 June 2013|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01488-6|pages=22–3|chapter=Ames, Louise Bates}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ames was known as a pioneer of child development studies, introducing the theory of [[child development stages]] to popular discourse.  Ames authored numerous internationally renowned books on the stages of child development, hosted a television show on child development, and co-founded the [[Gesell Institute of Child Development]] in New Haven, CT.

Ames's work found that children go through clear, discrete developmental phases based on age.  She demonstrated that various age groups feature unique behavioral patterns, to be considered by parents and doctors in monitoring children's development.  Perhaps the best-known legacy of her work was the coining of the term "[[Child development stages|Terrible Twos]]," to describe the rigid, conflict-laden behavioral patterns of two-year-olds.

==Life==
Ames (née Bates) was born on 29 October 1908 in Portland, Maine to Samuel Lewis Bates and Annie Earle Leach Bates.  The oldest of three, Ames was the only daughter of the Bates family.  Her father, a respected lawyer and judge, and her mother, a school teacher, valued education and fostered a stimulating educational environment for Ames and her two younger brothers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.feministvoices.com/louise-bates-ames/|title=Louise Bates Ames|last=|first=|date=|website=Psychology's Feminist Voices|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ames attended Portland public schools throughout her primary and secondary education.  Here she developed an interest in debating, history, and literature, and dreamed of becoming a lawyer like her father.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  After her 1926 high school graduation, Ames attended [[Wheaton College (Massachusetts)|Wheaton College]], an all-girls school in Norton, Massachusetts.  Ames chafed against what she felt was Wheaton's elitist culture and transferred to the [[University of Maine]] in 1928.  While she had intended to pursue law, an undergraduate course in psychology struck Ames's interest, and in 1930 she graduated from the University of Maine with a degree in psychology.  That same year, she married fellow psychology student Smith Ames.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  They divorced in 1937.

Ames earned a master's degree in psychology from the University of Maine in 1933.  That same year, she joined the [[Yale Clinic of Child Development]] as research assistant to [[Arnold Gesell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=Richard|date=July 1999|title=Obituary: Louise Bates Ames (1908–1996)|url=|journal=[[American Psychologist]]|volume=54|issue=7|pages=|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.54.7.516|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ames worked at the clinic from 1933 to 1948, co-authoring a number of works with Gesell, and received her Ph.D. from [[Yale University]] in 1936 in experimental psychology.  Her dissertation, ''The sequential patterning of prone progression in the human infant,'' was published as a journal article in 1937.&lt;ref name="JamesJames" /&gt;  The paper explored infants' transition to crawling, or "prone progression."

While at the Yale Clinic of Child Development, Ames published a number of works exploring the stages of child development.  Over the course of the 40's, she began translating that work into a trilogy of internationally-successful books. ''The First Five Years of Life'' (1940), ''Infant and Child in the Culture of Today'' (1943), and ''The Child From Five to Ten'' (1946) extended Gesell’s descriptions of children’s stages of growth from motor and cognitive development to that of personal-social activity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1938, Ames made the first of a number of films about child development.  Produced for Encyclopedia Films, ''How Behavior Grows: The Sequential Patterning of Prone Progression'' was an adaptation of her dissertation on prone progression in infants.  In 1944, Ames accepted a position as curator of Yale Films of Child Development.

After her retirement from the Yale Clinic of Child Development, Ames and her colleague Dr. Frances L. Ilg worked with Janet Learned to co-found the [[Gesell Institute of Child Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gesellinstitute.org/pages/the-institute|title=The Origins of The Gesell Institute|website=Gesell Institute|accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The institute, founded in 1950, is located in New Haven, Connecticut, though operated independently of Yale.  Ames was appointed director of research at the institute.  At the time, she was also a member of International Council of Women Psychologists.  In her work with the council, she conducted a large-scale survey with Harriet Fjeld of women psychologists' professional experiences. The survey was published in the ''Journal of Social Psychology''.&lt;ref name="JamesJames" /&gt;

In 1951, Ames and Ilg began a newspaper column, ''Child Behavior''.  The question-and-answer column featured write-in questions from parents and advised them with an eye towards child developmental psychology.  The column ran for a number of years, leading to their popular book, also titled ''Child Behavior'' (1981).  In 1962, Bates and Ilg changed the name of the column to ''Parents Ask'', which was the title of another widely selling book they published together that year. At the same time, Bates also worked on a half hour weekly TV show called ''Child Behavior''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1952, Ames (et al.) published a monumental normative study on age and its relation to Rorschach responses. Her findings were published in the trilogy ''The Master Work Series.'' Prior to Bates’ research, clinicians had been using a single standard to judge the normality of Rorschach responses. Bates demonstrated that both children and the elderly have patterns of response that are different from other age groups. Her research further supported her existing claim that age must be considered when evaluating the significance of differences in behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bates was a prolific writer, publishing papers and books until her death in 1996, of thyroid [[cancer]]. She died at her granddaughter's home in [[Cincinnati]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Fountain, [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/07/us/louise-ames-88-a-child-psychologist-dies.html Louise Ames, 88, a Child Psychologist, Dies], ''[[New York Times]]'', 7 November 1996.

&lt;!-- Side effects --&gt;
Silver generally has low toxicity, and minimal risk is expected when silver is used in approved medical applications.&lt;ref name=pmid16766878&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1159/000093928 |pmid=16766878 |chapter=Silver in Health Care: Antimicrobial Effects and Safety in Use |title=Biofunctional Textiles and the Skin |volume=33 |pages=17–34 |series=Current Problems in Dermatology |year=2006 |last1=Lansdown |first1=Alan B.G | name-list-format = vanc |isbn=978-3-8055-8121-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alternative medicine]] products such as colloidal silver are not safe or effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Over-the-Counter Drug Products Containing Colloidal Silver Ingredients or Silver Salts|url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/98fr/081799a.txt|website=FDA|access-date=18 August 2016|date=August 17, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
Silver and most silver compounds have an [[oligodynamic effect]] and are toxic for bacteria, algae, and fungi ''[[in vitro]]''. The antibacterial action of silver is dependent on the silver ion.&lt;ref name=pmid16766878/&gt; The effectiveness of silver compounds as an antiseptic is based on the ability of the biologically active silver ion ({{chem|Ag|+}}) to irreversibly damage key enzyme systems in the cell membranes of pathogens.&lt;ref name=pmid16766878/&gt; The antibacterial action of silver has long been known to be enhanced by the presence of an [[electric field]]. Applying an electric current across silver electrodes enhances antibiotic action at the anode, likely due to the release of silver into the bacterial culture.&lt;ref name=pmid15825319&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spadaro JA, Berger TJ, Barranco SD, Chapin SE, Becker RO | title = Antibacterial effects of silver electrodes with weak direct current | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 637–42 | date = November 1974 | pmid = 15825319 | pmc = 444706 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.6.5.637 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The antibacterial action of electrodes coated with silver nanostructures is greatly improved in the presence of an electric field.&lt;ref name=pmid27877266&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Akhavan O, Ghaderi E | title = Enhancement of antibacterial properties of Ag nanorods by electric field | journal = Science and Technology of Advanced Materials | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 015003 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 27877266 | pmc = 5109610 | doi = 10.1088/1468-6996/10/1/015003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silver, used as a topical antiseptic, is incorporated by bacteria it kills. Thus dead bacteria may be the source of silver which may kill additional bacteria.&lt;ref name="pmid25906433"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wakshlak RB, Pedahzur R, Avnir D | title = Antibacterial activity of silver-killed bacteria: the "zombies" effect | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 5 | pages = 9555 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25906433 | pmc = 5386105 | doi = 10.1038/srep09555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systemic reviews in 2014, 2017 and 2018 concluded that more modern dressings, with and without silver, show better results for wound healing and infection prevention than silver sulfadiazine (SSD).&lt;ref name=pmid24899251&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rashaan ZM, Krijnen P, Klamer RR, Schipper IB, Dekkers OM, Breederveld RS | title = Nonsilver treatment vs. silver sulfadiazine in treatment of partial-thickness burn wounds in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Wound Repair and Regeneration | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 473–82 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24899251 | doi = 10.1111/wrr.12196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid28161149&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nherera LM, Trueman P, Roberts CD, Berg L | title = A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical outcomes associated with nanocrystalline silver use compared to alternative silver delivery systems in the management of superficial and deep partial thickness burns | journal = Burns | volume = 43 | issue = 5 | pages = 939–948 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28161149 | doi = 10.1016/j.burns.2017.01.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid29903603&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nímia HH, Carvalho VF, Isaac C, Souza FÁ, Gemperli R, Paggiaro AO | title = Comparative study of Silver Sulfadiazine with other materials for healing and infection prevention in burns: A systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Burns | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29903603 | doi = 10.1016/j.burns.2018.05.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endotracheal tubes===
Limited evidence suggests that [[endotracheal tube|endotracheal breathing tubes]] coated with silver may reduce the incidence of [[ventilator associated pneumonia]] (VAP) and delay its onset, although no benefit is seen in the duration of intubation, the duration of stay in intensive care or the mortality rate.&lt;ref name=pmid22744316/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid22645207&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hunter JD | title = Ventilator associated pneumonia | journal = BMJ | volume = 344 | pages = e3325 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22645207 | pmc = 2563696 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.e3325 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid23528117&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li X, Yuan Q, Wang L, Du L, Deng L | title = Silver-coated endotracheal tube versus non-coated endotracheal tube for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia among adults: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials | journal = Journal of Evidence-Based Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–30 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 23528117 | doi = 10.1111/j.1756-5391.2012.01165.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns have been raised surrounding the [[unblinded trial|unblinded]] nature of some of the studies.&lt;ref name=pmid22744316/&gt; It is unknown if they are cost effective,&lt;ref name=pmid23035371&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kane T, Claman F | title = Silver tube coatings in pneumonia prevention | journal = Nursing Times | volume = 108 | issue = 36 | pages = 21–3 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23035371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and more high quality scientific trials are needed.&lt;ref name=pmid23528117/&gt;

===Catheters===
Evidence does not support an important reduction in the risk of [[urinary tract infections]] when silver-alloy catheters are used.&lt;ref name=pmid25248140&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lam TB, Omar MI, Fisher E, Gillies K, MacLennan S | title = Types of indwelling urethral catheters for short-term catheterisation in hospitalised adults | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 9 | pages = CD004013 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25248140 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004013.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These catheters are associated with greater cost than other catheters.&lt;ref name=pmid25248140/&gt;

A combination of [[chlorhexidine]] &amp; silver-sulfadiazine used in [[central venous catheters]] (CVC) reduces the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections.&lt;ref name=pmid7152256&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coppin-Raynal E, Le Coze D | title = Mutations relieving hypersensitivity to paromomycin caused by ribosomal suppressors in Podospora anserina | journal = Genetical Research | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–64 | date = October 1982 | pmid = 7152256 | doi = 10.1017/s0016672300019029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it seems difficult to discern whether the addition of silver-sulfadizine is responsible for the antimicrobial action of chlorhexidine-silver-sulfadiazine central venous catheters. As chlorhexidine alone may be the main cause of the antimicrobial action and more studies are needed in order to resolve this. Although, it has been hypothesized silver-sulfadizine may still help reduce infection through another, not yet determined, mechanism.&lt;ref name=pmid28534703&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Choi YJ, Lim JK, Park JJ, Huh H, Kim DJ, Gong CH, Yoon SZ | title = Chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine coating on central venous catheters is not sufficient for protection against catheter-related infection: Simulation-based laboratory research with clinical validation | journal = The Journal of International Medical Research | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 1042–1053 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28534703 | pmc = 5536400 | doi = 10.1177/0300060517708944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conjugations with existing drugs===
Research in 2018 into the treatment of central nervous system infections caused by free-living amoebae such as ''Naegleria fowleri'' and ''Acanthamoeba castellanii'', tested the effectiveness of existing drugs as well as the effectiveness of the same drugs when they were conjugated with silver nanoparticles. In vitro tests demonstrated more potent amoebicidal effects for the drugs when conjugated with silver nanoparticles as compared to the same drugs when used alone. They also found that conjugating the drugs with silver nanoparticles enhanced their anti-acanthamoebic activity. &lt;ref&gt;Clinically-approved drugs against CNS diseases as potential therapeutic agents to target brain-eating amoebae, by Ayaz Anwar, Kavitha Rajendran, Ruqaiyyah Siddiqui, Muhammad Raza Shah, and Naveed Ahmed Khan; ACS Chemical Neuroscience, DOI: 10.1021/acschemneuro.8b00484; October 15, 2018 – at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acschemneuro.8b00484 &lt;/ref&gt;

===X-ray film===
Silver-halide imaging plates used with [[X-ray]] imaging were the standard before digital techniques arrived. Silver x-ray film remains popular for its accuracy, and cost effectiveness, particularly in developing countries, where digital X-ray technology is usually not available.&lt;ref name=pmid24086301&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zennaro F, Oliveira Gomes JA, Casalino A, Lonardi M, Starc M, Paoletti P, Gobbo D, Giusto C, Not T, Lazzerini M | title = Digital radiology to improve the quality of care in countries with limited resources: a feasibility study from Angola | journal = PLOS One | volume = 8 | issue = 9 | pages = e73939 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24086301 | pmc = 3783475 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0073939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses===
Silver compounds have been used in external preparations as antiseptics, including both [[silver nitrate]] and [[silver proteinate]], which can be used in dilute solution as eyedrops to prevent [[conjunctivitis]] in newborn babies. Silver nitrate is also sometimes used in dermatology in solid stick form as a [[cauterization|caustic]] ("lunar caustic") to treat certain skin conditions, such as corns and warts.&lt;ref name=NCCIHsilver/&gt;

Silver nitrate is also used in certain laboratory procedures to stain cells. As it turns them permanently a dark-purple/black color, in doing so increasing individual cells' visibility under a microscope and allowing for differentiation between cells, or identification of irregularities. 
Silver is also used in bone prostheses, reconstructive orthopedic surgery, and cardiac devices.&lt;ref name=pmid16766878/&gt; [[Silver diamine fluoride]] appears to be an effective intervention to reduce dental caries (tooth decay).&lt;ref name=pmid19278981&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenblatt A, Stamford TC, Niederman R | title = Silver diamine fluoride: a caries "silver-fluoride bullet" | journal = Journal of Dental Research | volume = 88 | issue = 2 | pages = 116–25 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19278981 | doi = 10.1177/0022034508329406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid19820733&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deery C | title = Silver lining for caries cloud? | journal = Evidence-Based Dentistry | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 68 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19820733 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ebd.6400661 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver is also a component in dental [[amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]].

==Adverse effects==
{{main|Argyria}}
Though toxicity of silver is low, the human body has no biological use for silver and when inhaled, ingested, injected, or applied topically, silver will accumulate irreversibly in the body, particularly in the skin, and chronic use combined with exposure to sunlight can result in a disfiguring condition known as [[argyria]] in which the skin becomes blue or blue-gray.&lt;ref name=pmid16766878/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid8632503/&gt; Localized argyria can occur as a result of topical use of silver-containing creams and solutions, while the ingestion, inhalation, or injection can result in generalized argyria.&lt;ref name=pmid16021155&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brandt D, Park B, Hoang M, Jacobe HT | title = Argyria secondary to ingestion of homemade silver solution | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 53 | issue = 2 Suppl 1 | pages = S105-7 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16021155 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2004.09.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid17538258&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Okan D, Woo K, Sibbald RG | title = So what if you are blue?

There is no evidence that colloidal silver treats or prevents any medical condition, and it can cause serious and potentially irreversible side effects such as [[argyria]].&lt;ref name=NCCIHsilver/&gt;

In August 1999, the U.S. FDA banned colloidal silver sellers from claiming any therapeutic or preventive value for the product,&lt;ref name="fda-rule"/&gt; although silver-containing products continue to be promoted as [[dietary supplement]]s in the U.S. under the looser regulatory standards applied to supplements.&lt;ref name="fda-rule"/&gt; The FDA has issued numerous [[FDA Warning Letter|Warning Letter]]s to Internet sites that have continued to promote colloidal silver as an antibiotic or for other medical purposes.&lt;ref name="fda-warn1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/NewsEvents/CVMUpdates/ucm127976.htm|title= Colloidal Silver Not Approved|access-date=2008-09-22 |publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]|date=2007-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fda-warn2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/warn/cyber/2001/Cyber097.pdf|title=FDA Warning Letter|access-date=2008-09-22|publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]|date=2001-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fda-warn3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/ucm253264.htm|title=FDA Warning Letter|access-date=2013-04-11|publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the efforts of the FDA, silver products remain widely available on the market today.

In 2009, the USFDA issued a "Consumer Advisory" warning about the potential adverse effects of colloidal silver, and said that "...there are no legally marketed prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) drugs containing silver that are taken by mouth."&lt;ref&gt;FDA Consumer Advisory (October 6, 2009).

The incidence of neonatal teeth varies considerably, between 1:700 and 1:30,000 depending on the type of study; the highest prevalence is found in the only study that relies on personal examination of patients.&lt;ref name="Massler"&gt;{{cite journal|last=MASSLER|first=M|author2=SAVARA, BS|title=Natal and neonatal teeth; a review of 24 cases reported in the literature.|journal=The Journal of Pediatrics|date=March 1950|volume=36|issue=3|pages=349–59|pmid=15405415|url=http://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(50)80105-1/abstract|doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(50)80105-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natal teeth, and neonatal teeth, can be the baby's normal deciduous teeth, sprouting prematurely.&lt;ref name=Nih/&gt; These should be preserved, if possible.  Alternately, they could be [[supernumary teeth]], extra teeth, not part of the normal allotment of teeth.&lt;ref name=NatalReview2006/&gt;

==Presentation==
Most often natal teeth are mandibular central incisors.&lt;ref name=Kates&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kates|first=GA|author2=Needleman, HL |author3=Holmes, LB |title=Natal and neonatal teeth: a clinical study|journal=Journal of the American Dental Association|date=September 1984|volume=109|issue=3|pages=441–3|pmid=6592231}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have little root structure and are attached to the end of the gum by soft tissue and are often mobile.&lt;ref name=MedlinePlus&gt;{{cite web|title=Natal teeth|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003268.htm|publisher=MedlinePlus : U.S. National Library of Medicine|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Most of the time, natal teeth are not related to a medical condition. However, sometimes they may be associated with:&lt;ref name=MedlinePlus /&gt;
* [[Ellis–van Creveld syndrome]]&lt;ref name=MedlinePlus /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellis-van&gt;{{cite web|title=Ellis-van Creveld syndrome|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001667.htm|publisher=MedlinePlus : U.S. National Library of Medicine|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hallermann–Streiff syndrome]]&lt;ref name=MedlinePlus /&gt;
* [[Pierre Robin syndrome]]&lt;ref name=MedlinePlus /&gt;
* [[Sotos syndrome]]&lt;ref name=MedlinePlus /&gt;

==Treatment==
No intervention is usually recommended unless they are causing difficulty to the infant or mother.&lt;ref name="Massler" /&gt;

However some recommend that they be removed as the tooth can cut or amputate the tip of the tongue.

&lt;!-- Since natal and neo-natal teeth can erupt without roots, or inadequate roots, they can come loose and form a choking hazard for the infant.&lt;ref name=Nih/&gt;

Natal or neo-natal teeth can be the baby's normal deciduous teeth, sprouting prematurely.&lt;ref name=Nih/&gt; In that case it is recommended to take steps to preserve them.  Poorly formed teeth, without roots, or with inadequate roots, can be easily removed, sometimes without tools, with a doctor's fingers, alone. 
 --&gt;
They should be left in the mouth as long as possible to decrease the likelihood of removing permanent tooth buds with the natal tooth.&lt;ref name=Martinez&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martinez|first=CR|title=Management of natal teeth|journal=The Journal of family practice|date=March 1978|volume=6|issue=3|pages=654–5|pmid=632777}}&lt;/ref&gt; They should also not be removed if the infant has [[hypoprothrombinemia]].&lt;ref name=Martinez /&gt; In case of complications when the natal teeth need to be removed, dental radiographs should be obtained whenever possible, and evaluated and followed up with [[Pediatric dentistry|pediatric dentists]].&lt;ref name=Martinez /&gt;

'''O'Connor Hospital''' is a [[hospital]] operated by the [[Verity Health System]] in [[San Jose, California]]. It was founded in 1889, and was the first hospital in [[Santa Clara County, California]]. O'Connor Hospital was built by Judge Myles P. O'Connor and his wife, Amanda. The original hospital was built on {{convert|15|acre}} of property on the corner of Race Street and West San Carlos Street. 

The O'Connors were very well known as being [[Benefactor (law)|benefactor]]s of many [[charitable organizations]]. The O'Connors' first thoughts were to build an elderly home, however, the demands of the community at that time was for a hospital. [[Patrick William Riordan|Patrick Riordan]], [[Archbishop of San Francisco]], suggested that a hospital should be built. The O'Connors then asked the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Daughters of Charity]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dochs.org/Pages/default.aspx Daughters of Charity Health System&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; to operate the hospital. Four Daughters of Charity moved into the facility on May 1, 1889.

In 1953, O'Connor Hospital moved to its present site on Forest Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oconnorhospital.org/about/Pages/HistoryofOConnorHospital.aspx History of O'Connor Hospital&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, Daughters of Charity announced they would be shedding the hospital for financial reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.kqed.org/news/11697652/santa-clara-county-moves-to-buy-two-hospitals-after-bankruptcy|title=Santa Clara County Moves to Buy Two Hospitals After Bankruptcy|date= October 10, 2018|work=[[KQED]]|department=THE CALIFORNIA REPORT|access-date=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Organ transplantation in China''' has taken place since the 1960s, and is one of the largest [[organ transplant]] programmes in the world, peaking at over 13,000 transplants a year in 2004.&lt;ref name=Lancet/&gt; China is also involved in innovative transplant surgery such as [[face transplantation]] including bone.&lt;ref name=bone/&gt;

Involuntary [[organ harvesting]] is illegal under Chinese law; though, under a 1984 regulation, it became legal to remove organs from executed criminals with the prior consent of the criminal or permission of relatives. Growing concerns about possible ethical abuses arising from coerced consent and corruption led medical groups and human rights organizations, by the 1990s, to start condemning the practice.&lt;ref name=TTS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dafoh.org/the-transplantation-societys-policy-on-interactions-with-china |title=The Transplantation Society’s Policy on Interactions With China |author=Annika Tibell|publisher=Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting |date= 8 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns resurfaced in 2001, when a Chinese asylum-seeking doctor testified that he had taken part in organ extraction operations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/29/world/doctor-says-he-took-transplant-organs-from-executed-chinese-prisoners.html "Doctor Says He Took Transplant Organs From Executed Chinese Prisoners"] New York Times 29 June 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, allegations emerged that a large number of [[Organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China|Falun Gong practitioners had been killed to supply China's organ transplant industry]].&lt;ref name=orgharv/&gt;&lt;ref name=CGOH&gt;Gutmann, Ethan.  [http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/824qbcjr.asp "China’s Gruesome Organ Harvest"], [[The Weekly Standard]], 24 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; An initial [[Kilgour-Matas report|investigation]] stated "the source of 41,500 transplants for the six year period 2000 to 2005 is unexplained" and concluded that "there has been and continues today to be large scale organ seizures from unwilling Falun Gong practitioners".&lt;ref name=orgharv/&gt;

In December 2005, China's Deputy Health Minister acknowledged that the practice of removing organs from executed prisoners for transplants was widespread.&lt;ref name=tidyup/&gt; In 2007, China issued regulations banning the commercial trading of organs,&lt;ref name="www.chinadaily.com.cn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-04/10/content_9711027.htm |title=New system to boost number of organ donors |work=China Daily |accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Chinese Medical Association]] agreed that the organs of prisoners should not be used for transplantation, except for members of the immediate family of the deceased.&lt;ref name=CMA&gt;Press release, [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/84754.php "Chinese Medical Association Reaches Agreement With World Medical Association Against Transplantation Of Prisioners's (sic) Organs"], ''[[Medical News Today]]'', 7 October 2007. Retrieved 24 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a liver-transplant registry system was established in Shanghai, along with a nationwide proposal to incorporate information on individual driving permits for those wishing to donate their organs.&lt;ref name=liver&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shanghai.gov.cn/shanghai/node17256/node18151/userobject22ai29524.html |title=shanghai |publisher=shanghai.gov.cn |accessdate=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these initiatives, ''[[China Daily]]'' reported in August 2009 that approximately 65% of transplanted organs still came from death row prisoners.  The condemned prisoners have been described as "not a proper source for organ transplants" by Vice-Health Minister Huang Jiefu,&lt;ref name=bbc20090826&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8222732.stm |title=China admits death row organ use |publisher= BBC News |date=26 August 2009| accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2010 he announced the trial of China's first [[organ donation]] program starting after death, jointly run by the [[Red Cross Society]] and the Ministry of Health, in 10 pilot regions. In 2013, Huang Jiefu altered his position on utilizing prisoners' organs, stating that death row prisoners should be allowed to donate organs and should be integrated into the new computer-based organ allocation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robertson|first=Matthew|title=China Transplant Official Backtracks on Prisoner Organs|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/558858-china-transplant-official-backtracks-on-prisoner-organs/|accessdate=14 March 2014|newspaper=The Epoch Times|date=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China media: Military spending|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-26445553|accessdate=14 March 2014|publisher=BBC|date=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International concerns==

=== Organs sourced from prisoners sentenced to death ===
Transplantation first began in the early 1970s China, when organs were sourced from executed prisoners. Although other sources, such as brain-dead donors, had been tried, the lack of legal framework hampered efforts. Dr Klaus Chen said in 2007 that this was still the dominant pool.&lt;ref name=chen/&gt; Concerns that some poorer countries were answering donor shortages by selling organs to richer countries led the [[World Medical Association]] (WMA) to condemn the purchase and sale of human organs for transplantation at Brussels in 1985,&lt;ref name=Geneva/&gt; in 1987 and at Stockholm in 1994.&lt;ref name=icrc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jnyk.htm |title=The Bellagio Task Force Report on Transplantation, Bodily Integrity, and the International Traffic in Organs  |publisher=icrc.org |accessdate= 26 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Madrid in 1987, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) condemned the practice of extracting organs from executed prisoners due to the difficulty of knowing if they had given consent.&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt; Growing concern led other professional societies and human rights organisations to condemn the practice in the 1990s,&lt;ref name=TTS/&gt; and to question the way in which the organs were obtained.&lt;ref name=tidyup/&gt; The WHO starting drafting an international guideline (WHA44.25) on human organ transplants in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/ethics/topics/human_transplant_report/en/index.html |title=Human organ and tissue transplantation |publisher=WHO |accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the ''WHO Guiding Principles on Human Organ Transplantation'' being endorsed in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/ethics/topics/transplantation_guiding_principles/en/index.html |title=Draft guiding principles on human organ transplantation |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the wording did not allow the international community to draw up any laws preventing China from continuing to trade in human organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/ted/prisonorgans.htm |title=Illegal Human Organ Trade from Executed Prisoners in China |publisher=www1.american.edu |accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Medical Association]], the Korean Medical Association, and the [[Chinese Medical Association]] reached an agreement in 1998 that these practices were undesirable and that they would jointly investigate them with a view to stopping them; however, in 2000, the Chinese withdrew their cooperation.&lt;ref name=Hillman&gt;[[Harold Hillman]] in a letter published in the November 2001 issue of ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' {{cite journal|pmc=1121712 |title=Harvesting organs from recently executed prisoners | pmid=11758525 |volume=323 |issue=7323 |date=November 2001 |author=Hillman H |journal=BMJ |page=1254 |doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7323.1254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International claimed to have strong evidence that the police, courts and hospitals were complicit in the organ trade, facilitated by the use of mobile execution chambers, or "death vans".&lt;ref name=calum&gt;Calum MacLeod, [https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-06-14-death-van_x.htm China makes ultimate punishment mobile], ''[[USA Today]]'', 15 May 2006. Retrieved 24 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty speculated that this profitable trade might explain China's refusal to consider abolishing the death penalty, which is used on between 1,770 (official figure) and 8,000 (Amnesty estimates) prisoners annually. Corpses are typically cremated before relatives or independent witnesses can view them, fuelling suspicions about the fate of internal organs.&lt;ref name=calum/&gt;

In June 2001, Wang Guoqi, a Chinese doctor applying for [[political asylum]], made contact with Harry Wu and his Laogai Research Foundation, who assisted Wang in testifying to the [[US Congress]] in writing that he had removed skin and corneas from more than 100 executed prisoners for the transplant market at the Tianjin Paramilitary Police General Brigade Hospital, and that during at least one such operation the prisoner was still breathing.&lt;ref name=lies/&gt; Wang, a 'burns specialist', said that he had also seen other doctors remove vital organs from executed prisoners; and the hospital where he worked sold those organs to foreigners. Harry Wu said that he had gone to "great lengths" to verify Wang's identity and that both the foundation and congressional staff members found the doctor's statements "highly credible."&lt;ref name='WashPost'&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A49239-2001Jun26 |title=Chinese Doctor Tells of Organ Removals After Executions |accessdate=21 September 2008|last=Mufson |first=Steven |date=27 June 2001|work=The Washington Post |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5azlCotB6 |archivedate=21 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eve of a state visit to the United States by President Hu Jintao, the 800-member British Transplantation Society also criticised China's use of death-row prisoners' organs in transplants, on the grounds that as it is impossible to verify that organs are indeed from prisoners who have given consent;&lt;ref name=grim/&gt; the WMA once again condemned the practice on similar grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Press release, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070427100933/http://www.wma.net/e/press/2006_4.htm "World Medical Association demands China stops using prisoners for organ transplants"], World Medical Association, 22 May 2006.

=== {{anchor|2006 allegations of living harvesting}}Allegations of organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners ===
{{see also|Organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China|Persecution of Falun Gong#Organ harvesting}}
In 2006, allegations that [[Falun Gong]] practitioners had been killed to supply China's organ transplant industry prompted an investigation by former Canadian Secretary of State [[David Kilgour]] and human rights lawyer [[David Matas]]. In July 2006, the [[Kilgour-Matas report]]&lt;ref name=orgharv&gt;[[David Kilgour]], [[David Matas]] (6 July 2006, revised 31 January 2007)  [http://organharvestinvestigation.net An Independent Investigation into Allegations of Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China] (free in 22 languages) organharvestinvestigation.net&lt;/ref&gt; questioned "the source of 41,500 transplants for the six year period 2000 to 2005" and thereby inferred that "the government of China and its agencies in numerous parts of the country, in particular hospitals but also detention centres and 'people's courts', since 1999 have put to death a large but unknown number of Falun Gong prisoners of conscience".&lt;ref name=orgharv/&gt;

In December 2006, after not getting assurances from the Chinese government about allegations relating to Chinese prisoners, the two major organ transplant hospitals in [[Queensland]], Australia, stopped transplant training for Chinese surgeons and banned joint research programs into organ transplantation with China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Hospitals-ban-Chinese-surgeon-training/2006/12/05/1165080933418.html "Hospitals ban Chinese surgeon training"], ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 5 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006 and April 2007, Chinese officials denied organ harvesting allegations, insisting that China abides by [[World Health Organization]] principles that prohibit the sale of human organs without written consent from donors.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Embassy in Canada (6 July 2006) [http://ca.china-embassy.org/eng/mtfw/press2/t261810.htm Response to the so called "China's organ harvesting report"], ca.china-embassy.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Embassy in Canada (15 April 2007) [http://ca.china-embassy.org/eng/mtfw/press2/t311443.htm Response to the so-called "Revised Report on China's Organ Harvesting"], ca.china-embassy.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008 two United Nations Special Rapporteurs reiterated their previous request for the Chinese authorities to adequately respond to the allegations,&lt;ref name=marketwireun2&gt;[http://www.theinformationdaily.com/2008/05/09/united-nations-human-rights-special-rapporteurs-reiterate-findings-on-chinas-organ-harvesting-from-falun-gong-practitioners United Nations Human Rights Special Rapporteurs Reiterate Findings on China's Organ Harvesting from Falun Gong Practitioners], 9 May 2008. Retrieved 24 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and to explain the source of organs which would account for the sudden increase in organ transplants in China since 2000.

On 12 September 2012, the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs]] held a hearing on the topic of organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience in China.&lt;ref name=OHRPD&gt;Damon Noto, M.D., Gabriel Danovitch, M.D., Charles Lee, M.D., Ethan Gutmann.

Gutmann found evidence that Falun Gong detainees in China were subject to medical exams designed to assess the health of their organs.&lt;ref name=uscongress&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/united-states/congress-hones-in-on-vast-organ-harvest-in-china-291603.html |title=US Congress Hones in on Vast Organ Harvest in China |work=[[Epoch Times]] |accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Damon Noto's testimony concluded up to 60,000 Falun Gong prisoners of conscience had been killed for their organs, and noted that there was an "exponential increase in transplantations" in China from 2000 onward, corresponding with the onset of the suppression of Falun Gong.&lt;ref name=uscongress/&gt;

[[Harry Wu]], a human rights activist, has questioned the Falun Gong's claims that Falun Gong members are specifically targeted for large-scale organ harvesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=08/09/2006 |title=Harry Wu questions Falun Gong's claims about organ transplants |url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Harry-Wu-questions-Falun-Gong's-claims-about-organ-transplants-6919.html |newspaper= AsiaNews.it |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= 09/08/2006 |title=Harry Wu mette in dubbio le accuse del Falun Gong sui trapianti di organi |url=http://www.asianews.it/notizie-it/Harry-Wu-mette-in-dubbio-le-accuse-del-Falun-Gong-sui-trapianti-di-organi-6919.html |newspaper=AsiaNews.it |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

International human rights lawyer [[David Matas]] argued Harry Wu's July 2006 article showed his views in his March 21 letter were formed before completing his investigation, so Wu's views were not based on his full investigation. Further, Harry Wu characterized the volume of organ harvesting Annie described as "technically impossible", but it is technically possible, according to medical expert.&lt;ref name="rebuttal to Harry Wu"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://organharvestinvestigation.net/report0701/report20070131.htm#_Toc158023109 | title=Appendix 16. Sujiatun | author=Matas/Kilgour | publisher =organharvestinvestigation.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Chinese government panel slammed the allegations in August 2016. Huang Jiefu, chairman of the National Organ Donation and Transplantation Committee, noted that there were 10,057 organ transplantation surgeries performed in China in 2015, accounting for 8.5 percent of global total, and 8 percent of drugs used globally, which matches China's national statistics.&lt;ref name="ChinaExperts"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-08/20/c_135617600.htm | title=Spotlight: Experts slam rumors of organ harvesting in China  | author=Wang Shen | publisher =New China}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Millis, professor of Surgery and chief of the Section of Transplantation of the University of Chicago Hospitals, corroborated that China is phasing out the organ transplantation of executed prisoners, and is moving towards a voluntary, donation-based system. José Nuñez, medical officer in charge of global organ transplantation at the [[World Health Organization]], noted that China is reaching global standards in organ transplantation, and believed that in a few years, China will be leading the field.&lt;ref name=ChinaExperts/&gt;

==Developments since 2006==

In March 2006, the Ministry of Health issued the ''Interim Provisions on Clinical Application and Management of Human Organ Transplantation'', which stipulated that medical centres must meet new requirements for transplant services; the provinces were made responsible for plans for clinical applications. Establishments performing transplantation were thereby obliged to incorporate considerations for ethics, medical and surgical expertise, and intensive care. In April 2006, the Committee of Clinical Application of Human Organ Transplantation Technologies was created to standardise clinical practice; a national summit on clinical management took place in November 2006 which issued a declaration outlining regulatory steps.&lt;ref name=Lancet/&gt; Professor Guo Shuzhong conducted a series of [[face transplant]] experiments in Xijing hospital, leading in April 2006 to the world's first face transplant that included bone.&lt;ref name=bone/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9010-worlds-second-face-transplant-performed-in-china.html |title=World's second face transplant performed in China – health – 18&amp;nbsp;April 2006 |work=New Scientist |accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The donor had been declared brain-dead before the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://health.dailynewscentral.com/content/view/2210/63 |title=Chinese Man Gets World's Second Face Transplant |publisher=health.dailynewscentral.com |accessdate=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007 the Regulation on Human Organ Transplantation came into force, banning organ trading and the removal of a person's organs without their prior written consent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.cn/zwgk/2007-04/06/content_574120.htm |title=人体器官移植条例 |publisher=gov.cn |accessdate=21 May 2010}}[https://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=1&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.cn%2Fzwgk%2F2007-04%2F06%2Fcontent_574120.htm&amp;sl=zh-CN&amp;tl=en Google translation]. Retrieved 24 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and this has been favourably received by the World Health Organization and The Transplantation Society.&lt;ref name=Lancet/&gt;&lt;ref name=TTS/&gt; To curb illegal transplants, doctors involved in commercial trade of organs will face fines and suspensions; only a few hospitals will be certified to perform organ transplants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6534363.stm|title=China issues new rules on organs|publisher=BBC News|date=7 April 2007|accessdate=7 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of a systematic overhaul, the number of institutions approved for transplants has been reduced from more than 600 in 2007 to 87 as at October 2008; another 77 have received provisional approval from the Ministry of Health.&lt;ref name=Lancet/&gt;

To further combat transplant tourism, the Health Ministry issued a notice in July 2007 in line with the Istanbul Declaration, giving Chinese citizens priority as organ recipients.&lt;ref name=Lancet/&gt; In October 2007, after several years of discussions with the WHO, the Chinese Medical Association agreed to cease commercial organ collection from condemned prisoners, who would only be able to donate to their immediate relatives.&lt;ref name="CMA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pact to block harvesting of inmate organs, Pg 1, ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', 7 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Other safeguards implemented under the legislation include documentation of consent for organ removal from the donor, and review of all death sentences by the Supreme People's Court. Transplant professionals are not involved until death is declared. A symposium among legal and medical professionals was held in April 2008 to discuss the diagnostic criteria for brain death for donors of transplant organs.&lt;ref name=Lancet/&gt;

A liver-transplant registry system was established in Shanghai, in 2008, which allows the monitoring of the after-care of liver recipients; at the same time a nationwide proposal was announced that would allow people to note on their driving licence that they wish to donate their organs.&lt;ref name=liver/&gt; Despite these initiatives the ''[[China Daily]]'' newspaper reported in August 2009 that approximately 65% of transplanted organs still came from death row prisoners,&lt;ref name=bbc20090826/&gt; which has been described as "not a proper source for organ transplants" by Vice-Health Minister Huang Jiefu.&lt;ref name="www.chinadaily.com.cn"/&gt; China's first posthumous [[organ donation]] system was jointly launched in March 2010 by the [[Red Cross]] and the Ministry of Health.&lt;ref name=Lancet/&gt; Huang Jiefu announced that the scheme, which will allow people to express their wishes on their driver's licences, would be trialled in 10 pilot regions including the cities of [[Tianjin]], [[Wuhan]] and [[Shenzhen]].&lt;ref name="www.chinadaily.com.cn"/&gt; Funds will be made available for the families of people who voluntarily donate their organs. Chinese authorities say they hope the pilot program's success will reduce the need to take organs from death row prisoners and stem the tide of black market organs.&lt;ref name=bbc20090826/&gt; In 2012 China officials stated they plan to phase out organ harvesting of death-row inmates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304724404577298661625345898 China to Stop Harvesting Inmate Organs] 23 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, the report ''Organ Harvesting of Religious and Political Dissidents by the Chinese Communist Party''&lt;ref name=OHRPD/&gt; presented to the members of a US Congress Subcommittee by Damon Noto, the spokesperson for the organization Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting, opined: "Medical doctors outside China have confirmed that their patients have gone to China and received organs from Falun Gong practitioners".&lt;ref name=Damon&gt;Damon Noto, M.D., [http://archives.republicans.foreignaffairs.house.gov/112/HHRG-112-FA17-WState-NotoD-20120912.pdf Organ Harvesting of Religious and Political Dissidents by the Chinese Communist Party], [[House Committee on Foreign Affairs]], 12 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hangzhou resolution was promulgated in front of the 2013 China National Transplantation Congress on 31 October 2013 and was presented on 2 November 2013. The resolution vows for the cessation of the harvesting of organs from executed prisoners. While not all transplantation facilities have adopted the resolution, a campaign to eradicate inmate organ harvesting is underway.&lt;ref name=hangzhouresolution&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hangzhou Resolution and Report of Meeting with Minister Bin Li of the National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China|url=http://www.declarationofistanbul.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=424:the-hangzhou-resolution-and-report-of-meeting-with-minister-bin-li-of-the-national-health-and-family-planning-commission-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china&amp;catid=50:articles-relevant-to-the-declaration&amp;Itemid=67|publisher=Declaration of Istanbul|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otofacial syndrome''' is an extraordinarily rare [[congenital deformity]] in which a person is born without a [[mandible]], and, consequently, without a [[chin]].

In nearly all cases, the child does not survive because it is unable to breathe and eat properly. Even with [[reconstructive surgery]], the [[tongue]] is extremely underdeveloped, making unaided breathing and swallowing impossible.
==Cause==
{{Empty section|date=September 2017}}

==Treatment==
The first challenge to survival is assisted breathing and tubal feeding. This is a lifelong affair, generally requiring the patient to spend nearly all of the time under direct hospital care.

[[United States|America]]n surgeons successfully used bone from the hip of an [[Ireland|Irish]] teenager named Alan Doherty to rebuild a jaw and chin. Surgeons began the procedures in June 2007 and completed the final of seven surgeries on 25 August 2008. Doherty is now able to smile, but is still unable to breathe, eat, or speak on his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Surgeons give teenager a new chin | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7791706.stm | accessdate = 2008-12-19 |date=2008-12-19 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = A New Face for Teenager Born Without Jaw | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,411482,00.html | accessdate = 2008-12-19 |date=2008-08-27 | work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Passive smoking''' is the inhalation of smoke, called '''second-hand smoke''' ('''SHS'''), or '''environmental tobacco smoke''' ('''ETS'''), by persons other than the intended "active" smoker. It occurs when tobacco smoke permeates any environment, causing its inhalation by people within that environment.

* Smoking by either parent, particularly by the mother, increases the risk of asthma in children.
* The outlook for early childhood asthma is less favourable in smoking households.
* Children with asthma who are exposed to smoking in the home generally have more severe disease.
* Many adults with asthma identify ETS as a trigger for their symptoms.
* Doctor-diagnosed asthma is more common among non-smoking adults exposed to ETS than those not exposed. Among people with asthma, higher ETS exposure is associated with a greater risk of severe attacks.

=== Risk level ===
The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] of the [[World Health Organization]] concluded in 2004 that there was sufficient evidence that second-hand smoke caused cancer in humans.&lt;ref name=IARC2004/&gt; Those who work in environments where smoke is not regulated are at higher risk. Workers particularly at risk of exposure include those in installation repair and maintenance, construction and extraction, and transportation.&lt;ref name=Fitzsimmons/&gt;

The [[Surgeon General of the United States|US Surgeon General]], in his 2006 report, estimated that living or working in a place where smoking is permitted increases the non-smokers' risk of developing heart disease by 25–30% and lung cancer by 20–30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK44324/|publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US)|date = 2006|access-date = 2015-04-24|pmid = 20669524|series = Publications and Reports of the Surgeon General|author1 = Office on Smoking Health (US)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., smokers that have not quit successfully have a risk of lung cancer about 20 times higher than that of never smokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Alberg |first=Anthony J. |last2=Brock |first2=Malcolm V. |last3=Ford |first3=Jean G. |last4=Samet |first4=Jonathan M. |last5=Spivack |first5=Simon D. |date=May 2013 |title=Epidemiology of lung cancer: Diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines  |journal=Chest |volume=143 |issue=5 Suppl |pages=e1S–e29S |doi=10.1378/chest.12-2345 |issn=1931-3543 |pmc=4694610 |pmid=23649439}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=Anna V.|last2=Glantz|first2=Stanton A.|last3=Halpern-Felsher|first3=Bonnie L.|date=December 2009|title=Perceptions of Second-hand Smoke Risks Predict Future Adolescent Smoking Initiation|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2009.04.022|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=45|issue=6|pages=618–625|doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2009.04.022|issn=1054-139X|pmc=2814413|pmid=19931835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biomarkers===
[[File:Breath CO Monitor.jpg|thumb|Breath CO monitor displaying carbon monoxide concentration of an exhaled breath sample (in ppm) with corresponding percent concentration of carboxyhemoglobin displayed below.]]
Environmental tobacco smoke can be evaluated either by directly measuring tobacco smoke pollutants found in the air or by using biomarkers, an indirect measure of exposure. [[Carbon monoxide breath monitor|Carbon monoxide]] monitored through breath, [[nicotine]], [[cotinine]], [[thiocyanates]], and proteins are the most specific biological markers of tobacco smoke exposure.&lt;ref name=Metz05&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Metz-Favre C, Donnay C, de Blay F |title=[Markers of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure] |language=French |journal=Rev Mal Respir |volume=22 |issue=1 Pt 1 |pages=81–92 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15968761 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McClure JB |title=Are biomarkers useful treatment aids for promoting health behavior change?

Certain groups of people are reluctant to disclose their smoking status and exposure to tobacco smoke, especially pregnant women and parents of young children. This is due to their smoking being socially unacceptable. Also, it may be difficult for individuals to recall their exposure to tobacco smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Klesges RC, Debon M, Ray JW |title=Are self-reports of smoking rate biased?

A 2007 study in the ''[[Addictive Behaviors]]'' journal found a positive correlation between second-hand tobacco smoke exposure and concentrations of nicotine and/or biomarkers of nicotine in the body. Significant biological levels of nicotine from second-hand smoke exposure were equivalent to nicotine levels from active smoking and levels that are associated with behaviour changes due to nicotine consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Okoli CT, Kelly T, Hahn EJ |title=Secondhand smoke and nicotine exposure: a brief review |journal=Addict Behav |volume=32 |issue=10 |pages=1977–88 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17270359 |doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2006.12.024 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306-4603(07)00002-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cotinine====
[[Cotinine]], the metabolite of nicotine, is a biomarker of second-hand smoke exposure. Typically, cotinine is measured in the blood, saliva, and urine. Hair analysis has recently become a new, noninvasive measurement technique. Cotinine accumulates in hair during hair growth, which results in a measure of long-term, cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke.&lt;ref name=Florescu09&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Florescu A, Ferrence R, Einarson T, Selby P, Soldin O, Koren G |title=Methods for quantification of exposure to cigarette smoking and environmental tobacco smoke: focus on developmental toxicology |journal=Ther Drug Monit |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=14–30 |date=February 2009 |pmid=19125149 |pmc=3644554 |doi=10.1097/FTD.0b013e3181957a3b |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0163-4356&amp;volume=31&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Urinary cotinine levels have been a reliable biomarker of tobacco exposure and have been used as a reference in many epidemiological studies. However, cotinine levels found in the urine reflect exposure only over the preceding 48 hours. Cotinine levels of the skin, such as the hair and nails, reflect tobacco exposure over the previous three months and are a more reliable biomarker.&lt;ref name=Metz05/&gt;

====Carbon monoxide (CO)====
[[Carbon monoxide breath monitor|Carbon monoxide monitored via breath]] is also a reliable biomarker of second-hand smoke exposure as well as tobacco use.  With high sensitivity and specificity, it not only provides an accurate measure, but the test is also non-invasive, highly reproducible, and low in cost.  Breath CO monitoring measures the concentration of CO in an exhalation in [[parts per million]], and this can be directly correlated to the blood CO concentration ([[carboxyhemoglobin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Irving JM, Clark EC, Crombie IK, Smith WC |title=Evaluation of a portable measure of expired-air carbon monoxide |journal=Prev Med |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=109–15 |date=January 1988 |pmid=3362796 |doi=10.1016/0091-7435(88)90076-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Breath CO monitors can also be used by emergency services to identify patients who are suspected of having CO poisoning.

== Pathophysiology ==
A 2004 study by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] of the [[World Health Organization]] concluded that non-smokers are exposed to the same carcinogens as active smokers. [[Sidestream smoke]] contains more than 4,000 chemicals, including 69 known carcinogens. Of special concern are [[polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons]], tobacco-specific N-[[nitrosamines]], and [[aromatic amines]], such as [[4-aminobiphenyl]], all known to be highly carcinogenic.  Mainstream smoke, sidestream smoke, and second-hand smoke contain largely the same components, however the concentration varies depending on type of smoke.&lt;ref name=IARC2004/&gt;  Several well-established [[carcinogen]]s have been shown by the tobacco companies' own research to be present at higher concentrations in sidestream smoke than in mainstream smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schick S, Glantz S |title=Philip Morris toxicological experiments with fresh sidestream smoke: more toxic than mainstream smoke |journal=Tob.

Second-hand smoke has been shown to produce more particulate-matter (PM) pollution than an idling low-emission [[diesel engine]]. In an experiment conducted by the Italian National Cancer Institute, three cigarettes were left [[smolder]]ing, one after the other, in a 60&amp;nbsp;m³ garage with a limited air exchange. The cigarettes produced PM pollution exceeding outdoor limits, as well as PM concentrations up to 10-fold that of the idling engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Invernizzi G, Ruprecht A, Mazza R, etal |title=Particulate matter from tobacco versus diesel car exhaust: an educational perspective |journal=Tob Control |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=219–21 |year=2004 |pmid=15333875 |pmc=1747905 |doi=10.1136/tc.2003.005975    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

though the magnitude of risk, if any, remains unknown. In October 2011, it was reported that Christus St. Frances Cabrini Hospital in [[Alexandria, Louisiana]] would seek to eliminate third-hand smoke beginning in July 2012, and that employees whose clothing smelled of smoke would not be allowed to work. This prohibition was enacted because third-hand smoke poses a special danger for the developing brains of infants and small children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/10/03/louisiana-hospital-to-ban-odor-smoke-on-workers-clothes/?test=latestnews Louisiana Hospital to Ban Odor of Smoke on Workers' Clothes], Fox News, October 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, there were more than 161,000 deaths attributed to lung cancer in the United States. Of these deaths, an estimated 10% to 15% were caused by factors other than first-hand smoking; equivalent to 16,000 to 24,000 deaths annually. Slightly more than half of the lung cancer deaths caused by factors other than first-hand smoking were found in nonsmokers. Lung cancer in non-smokers may well be considered one of the most common cancer mortalities in the United States. Clinical epidemiology of lung cancer has linked the primary factors closely tied to lung cancer in non-smokers as exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke, carcinogens including radon, and other indoor air pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Samet JM, Avila-Tang E, Boffetta P, etal |title=Lung cancer in never smokers: Clinical epidemiology and environmental risk factors |journal=Clin.

There is widespread [[scientific consensus]] that exposure to second-hand smoke is harmful.&lt;ref name="kessler"&gt;{{harvnb|Kessler|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The link between passive smoking and health risks is accepted by every major medical and scientific organisation, including:

* A [http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/doh/tobacco/part-2.htm 1998 report of the SCOTH] concluded that passive smoking was a cause of lung cancer, heart disease, and other health problems.

== Public opinion ==
Recent major surveys conducted by the U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]] and [[Centers for Disease Control]] have found widespread public awareness that second-hand smoke is harmful. In both 1992 and 2000 surveys, more than 80% of respondents agreed with the statement that second-hand smoke was harmful. A 2001 study found that 95% of adults agreed that second-hand smoke was harmful to children, and 96% considered tobacco-industry claims that second-hand smoke was not harmful to be untruthful.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Surgeon General|2006|p=588 Ch. 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 [[Gallup poll]] found that 56% of respondents felt that second-hand smoke was "very harmful", a number that has held relatively steady since 1997. Another 29% believe that second-hand smoke is "somewhat harmful"; 10% answered "not too harmful", while 5% said "not at all harmful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/28216/more-smokers-feeling-harassed-smoking-bans.aspx | title=More Smokers Feeling Harassed by Smoking Bans | website=Gallup | date=25 July 2007 | accessdate=20 February 2015 | author=Saad, Lydia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy over harm ==
As part of its attempt to prevent or delay tighter regulation of smoking, the tobacco industry funded a number of scientific studies and, where the results cast doubt on the risks associated with second-hand smoke, sought wide publicity for those results. The industry also funded libertarian and conservative think tanks, such as the [[Cato Institute]] in the United States and the [[Institute of Public Affairs]] in Australia which criticised both scientific research on passive smoking and policy proposals to restrict smoking.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Cato_Institute#Cato_and_the_tobacco_industry Cato and the tobacco industry]". Accessed 8 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nahan, Mike. ''The Australian'', 10 April  2000, "The IPA sings its own song".&lt;/ref&gt; ''New Scientist'' and the ''[[European Journal of Public Health]]'' have identified these industry-wide coordinated activities as one of the earliest expressions of [[Denialism#Corporate denialism|corporate denialism]]. Further, they state that the disinformation spread by the tobacco industry has created a ''tobacco denialism'' movement, sharing many characteristics of other forms of [[denialism]], such as [[AIDS denialism|HIV-AIDS denialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | journal=New Scientist | last1=Shermer|first1=Michael | last2=MacKenzie|first2=Debora | last3=Littlemore|first3=Richard | last4=Giles|first4=Jim | last5=Fitzpatrick|first5=Michael | date=15 May 2010 | pages=36–45 | title=State of Denial, a Special Report | url=https://www.newscientist.com/special/living-in-denial | accessdate=16 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Diethelm, PA  |author2=McKee, M | year = 2009 | title = Denialism: what is it and how should scientists respond? | journal = European Journal of Public Health | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–4 | url = http://eurpub.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/extract/19/1/2 |laysummary=http://denyingaids.blogspot.com/2009/05/denialism-what-is-it-and-how-should.html | ref = harv| doi = 10.1093/eurpub/ckn139 | pmid = 19158101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry-funded studies and critiques===

====Enstrom and Kabat====
A 2003 study by [[James Enstrom]] and [[Geoffrey Kabat]], published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', argued that the harms of passive smoking had been overstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Enstrom JE, Kabat GC |title=Environmental tobacco smoke and tobacco related mortality in a prospective study of Californians, 1960-98 |journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7398 |page=1057 |year=2003 |pmid=12750205 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7398.1057 |pmc=155687 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their analysis reported no statistically significant relationship between passive smoking and lung cancer, coronary heart disease (CHD), or [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], though the accompanying editorial noted that "they may overemphasise the negative nature of their findings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davey Smith G |title=Effect of passive smoking on health: More information is available, but the controversy still persists |journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7398 |pages=1048–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12750182 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7398.1048 |pmc=1125974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper was widely promoted by the tobacco industry as evidence that the harms of passive smoking were unproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kessler|2006|p=1383}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tong2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tong EK, Glantz SA |title=Tobacco industry efforts undermining evidence linking secondhand smoke with cardiovascular disease |journal=Circulation |volume=116 |issue=16 |pages=1845–54 |year=2007 |pmid=17938301 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.715888 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Cancer Society]] (ACS), whose database Enstrom and Kabat used to compile their data, criticized the paper as "neither reliable nor independent", stating that scientists at the ACS had repeatedly pointed out serious flaws in Enstrom and Kabat's methodology prior to publication.&lt;ref name="acsresponse"&gt;{{cite press release |url = http://www.no-smoke.org/pdf/BMJrelease.pdf |title = American Cancer Society Condemns Tobacco Industry Study for Inaccurate Use of Data |publisher = [[American Cancer Society]] |date = 2003-05-13 |accessdate = 2007-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the study had failed to identify a comparison group of "unexposed" persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/327/7418/E237 |author=Thun MJ |title=More misleading science from the tobacco industry |journal=BMJ |volume=327 |page=E237–8 |year=2003 |doi=10.1136/bmjusa.03070002|issue=7418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enstrom's ties to the tobacco industry also drew scrutiny; in a 1997 letter to [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]], Enstrom requested a "substantial research commitment... in order for me to effectively compete against the large mountain of epidemiologic data and opinions that already exist regarding the health effects of ETS and active smoking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/dfk37d00 |title = Proposed Research on the relationship of Low Levels of Active Smoking to Mortality: Letter from James Enstrom to Philip Morris Scientific Affairs office |date = 1997-01-01 |accessdate = 2007-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Passive smoking#US racketeering lawsuit against tobacco companies|US racketeering lawsuit against tobacco companies]], the Enstrom and Kabat paper was cited by the US District Court as "a prime example of how nine tobacco companies engaged in criminal racketeering and fraud to hide the dangers of tobacco smoke."&lt;ref name="nature-2007-review"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dalton R |title=Passive-smoking study faces review |journal=Nature |volume=446 |issue=7133 |pages=242 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17361147 |doi=10.1038/446242a |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v446/n7133/full/446242a.html |bibcode=2007Natur.446..242D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court found that the study had been funded and managed by the [[Center for Indoor Air Research]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kessler|2006|p=1380}}&lt;/ref&gt; a tobacco industry [[front group]] tasked with "offsetting" damaging studies on passive smoking, as well as by Philip Morris who stated that Enstrom's work was "clearly litigation-oriented."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kessler|2006|pp=1380–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 paper in ''Tobacco Control'' argued that the disclosure section in the Enstrom and Kabat BMJ paper, although it met the journal's requirements, "does not reveal the full extent of the relationship the authors had with the tobacco industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bero|first1=LA|last2=Glantz|first2=S|last3=Hong|first3=MK|title=The limits of competing interest disclosures |journal=Tobacco Control|date=April 2005|volume=14|issue=2|pages=118–26|pmid=15791022|pmc=1748015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Enstrom and Kabat published a [[meta-analysis]] of studies regarding passive smoking and coronary heart disease in which they reported a very weak association between passive smoking and heart disease mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Enstrom|first1=JE|last2=Kabat|first2=GC|title=Environmental tobacco smoke and coronary heart disease mortality in the United States--a meta-analysis and critique |journal=Inhalation Toxicology|date=March 2006|volume=18|issue=3|pages=199–210|doi=10.1080/08958370500434255|pmid=16399662|citeseerx=10.1.1.495.2191}}&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that exposure to second-hand smoke increased the risk of death from CHD by only 5%, although this analysis has been criticized for including two previous industry-funded studies that suffered from widespread exposure misclassification.&lt;ref name=Circ07/&gt;

====Milloy====
[[Steven Milloy]], the "[[junk science]]" commentator for [[Fox News]] and a former [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] consultant,&lt;ref&gt;[https://ssl.tnr.com/p/docsub.mhtml?i=20060206&amp;s=thacker020606 Smoked Out: Pundit for Hire], by Paul D.

Retrieved May 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another component of criticism cited by Milloy focused on [[relative risk]] and epidemiological practices in studies of passive smoking. Milloy, who has a master's degree from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, argued that studies yielding relative risks of less than 2 were meaningless junk science. This approach to epidemiological analysis was criticized in the ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'':

{{quote|A major component of the industry attack was the mounting of a campaign to establish a "bar" for "sound science" that could not be fully met by most individual investigations, leaving studies that did not meet the criteria to be dismissed as "junk science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Samet JM, Burke TA |title=Turning Science Into Junk: The Tobacco Industry and Passive Smoking |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=91 |issue=11 |pages=1742–4 |year=2001 |pmid=11684591 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.91.11.1742 |pmc=1446866 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The tobacco industry and affiliated scientists also put forward a set of "Good Epidemiology Practices" which would have the practical effect of obscuring the link between secondhand smoke and lung cancer; the privately stated goal of these standards was to "impede adverse legislation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmdocs.com/PDF/2029059645_9652_0.PDF Scientific Communications Through the Media]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, from the Philip Morris document archive.

==== Levois and Layard ====
In 1995, Levois and Layard, both tobacco industry consultants, published two analyses in the journal ''[[Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology]]'' regarding the association between spousal exposure to second-hand smoke and heart disease. Both of these papers reported no association between second-hand smoke and heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Layard|first1=MW|title=Ischemic heart disease and spousal smoking in the National Mortality Followback Survey |journal=Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology : RTP|date=February 1995|volume=21|issue=1|pages=180–3|pmid=7784629|doi=10.1006/rtph.1995.1022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LeVois|first1=ME|last2=Layard|first2=MW|title=Publication bias in the environmental tobacco smoke/coronary heart disease epidemiologic literature |journal=Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology : RTP|date=February 1995|volume=21|issue=1|pages=184–91|doi=10.1006/rtph.1995.1023|pmid=7784630}}&lt;/ref&gt; These analyses have been criticized for failing to distinguish between current and former smokers, despite the fact that former smokers, unlike current ones, are not at a significantly increased risk of heart disease.&lt;ref name=Circ07/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Law|first1=Malcolm R|last2=Wald|first2=Nicholas J|title=Environmental tobacco smoke and ischemic heart disease|journal=Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases|date=July 2003|volume=46|issue=1|pages=31–38|doi=10.1016/S0033-0620(03)00078-1|pmid=12920699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== World Health Organization controversy ====
A 1998 study by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) on environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) found "weak evidence of a dose-response relationship between risk of lung cancer and exposure to spousal and workplace ETS."&lt;ref name="environmental1440"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boffetta P, Agudo A, Ahrens W, etal |title=Multicenter case-control study of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and lung cancer in Europe |journal=J.

In March 1998, before the study was published, reports appeared in the media alleging that the IARC and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) were suppressing information. The reports, appearing in the British ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Passive Smoking Doesn't Cause Cancer —Official |url=http://tobaccodocuments.org/pm/2063594041-4042.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013185243/http://tobaccodocuments.org/pm/2063594041-4042.html |archivedate=2007-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Economist]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smokescreens – The World Health Organization is showing signs of allowing politics to get in the way of truth.

Zimbabwe Independent 1998, Oct 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;No Link Between Passive Smoking and Lung Cancer. [[The Times]] 1998, March 9.&lt;/ref&gt; alleged that the WHO withheld from publication of its own report that supposedly failed to prove an association between passive smoking and a number of other diseases (lung cancer in particular).

In response, the WHO issued a press release stating that the results of the study had been "completely misrepresented" in the popular press and were in fact very much in line with similar studies demonstrating the harms of passive smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Passive Smoking Does Cause Lung Cancer, Do Not Let Them Fool You |url=http://www.who.int/inf-pr-1998/en/pr98-29.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208231619/http://www.who.int/inf-pr-1998/en/pr98-29.html |archivedate=February 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was published in the ''Journal of the National Cancer Institute'' in October of the same year, and concluded the authors found "no association between childhood exposure to ETS and lung cancer risk" but "did find weak evidence of a dose–response relationship between risk of lung cancer and exposure to spousal and workplace ETS."&lt;ref name="environmental1440"/&gt;  An accompanying editorial summarized:

{{quote|When all the evidence, including the important new data reported in this issue of the Journal, is assessed, the inescapable scientific conclusion is that ETS is a low-level lung carcinogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blot WJ, McLaughlin JK |title=Passive smoking and lung cancer risk: what is the story now? |journal=J.

With the release of formerly classified tobacco industry documents through the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]], it was found (by Elisa Ong and [[Stanton Glantz]]) that the controversy over the WHO's alleged suppression of data had been engineered by [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]], [[British American Tobacco]], and other tobacco companies in an effort to discredit scientific findings which would harm their business interests.&lt;ref name="ong-glantz-2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ong EK, Glantz SA |title=Tobacco industry efforts subverting International Agency for Research on Cancer's second-hand smoke study |journal=Lancet |volume=355 |issue=9211 |pages=1253–9 |year=2000 |pmid=10770318 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02098-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A WHO inquiry, conducted after the release of the tobacco-industry documents, found that this controversy was generated by the tobacco industry as part of its larger campaign to cut the WHO's budget, distort the results of scientific studies on passive smoking, and discredit the WHO as an institution. This campaign was carried out using a network of ostensibly independent [[front organizations]] and international and scientific experts with hidden financial ties to the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tobacco Companies Strategies to Undermine Tobacco Control Activities at the World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/tobacco/media/en/who_inquiry.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== EPA lawsuit ====
In 1993, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) issued a report estimating that 3,000 lung cancer related deaths in the [[United States]] were caused by passive smoking annually.&lt;ref name="EPA report"&gt;US Environmental Protection Agency. {{cite web|url= http://oaspub.epa.gov/eims/eimscomm.getfile?p_download_id=36793 |title=Respiratory health effects of passive smoking: Lung cancer and other disorders }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Altria Group|Philip Morris]], [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]], and groups representing growers, distributors and marketers of tobacco took legal action, claiming that the EPA had manipulated this study and ignored accepted scientific and statistical practices.

The [[United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina]] ruled in favor of the tobacco industry in 1998, finding that the EPA had failed to follow proper scientific and epidemiologic practices and had "cherry picked" evidence to support conclusions which they had committed to in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Osteen Decision |url=http://www.tobacco.org/Documents/980717osteen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court stated in part, "EPA publicly committed to a conclusion before research had begun…adjusted established procedure and scientific norms to validate the Agency's public conclusion... In conducting the ETS Risk Assessment, disregarded information and made findings on selective information; did not disseminate significant epidemiologic information; deviated from its Risk Assessment Guidelines; failed to disclose important findings and reasoning…"

In 2002, the EPA successfully appealed this decision to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]]. The EPA's appeal was upheld on the preliminary grounds that their report had no regulatory weight, and the earlier finding was vacated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative vs. EPA|url=http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/982407.P.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-12-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009020709/http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/982407.P.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, through the publication by its National Toxicology Program of the 9th Report on Carcinogens, listed environmental tobacco smoke among the known carcinogens, observing of the EPA assessment that "The individual studies were carefully summarized and evaluated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |contribution=Final Report on Carcinogens – Background Document for Environmental Tobacco Smoke |title=Meeting of the NTP Board of Scientific Counselors – Report on Carcinogens Subcommittee |editor1=U.S. Department of Health |editor2=Human Services |editor3=National Toxicology Program |location=Research Triangle Park, North Carolina |date=December 2–3, 1998 |url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/files/EnvironmentalTS.pdf |page=24 |format=PDF |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129085500/http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/files/EnvironmentalTS.pdf |archivedate=2007-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tobacco-industry funding of research ====
The tobacco industry's role in funding scientific research on second-hand smoke has been controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thun MJ |title=Passive smoking: Tobacco industry publishes disinformation |journal=BMJ |volume=327 |issue=7413 |pages=502–3; author reply 504–5 |year=2003 |pmid=12946979 |doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7413.502-c |pmc=188400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of published studies found that tobacco-industry affiliation was strongly correlated with findings exonerating second-hand smoke; researchers affiliated with the tobacco industry were 88 times more likely than independent researchers to conclude that second-hand smoke was not harmful.&lt;ref name="pmid9605902"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barnes DE, Bero LA |title=Why review articles on the health effects of passive smoking reach different conclusions |journal=JAMA |volume=279 |issue=19 |pages=1566–70 |year=1998 |pmid=9605902|doi=10.1001/jama.279.19.1566 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a specific example which came to light with the release of tobacco-industry documents, Philip Morris executives successfully encouraged an author to revise his industry-funded review article to downplay the role of second-hand smoke in [[sudden infant death syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tong EK, England L, Glantz SA |title=Changing conclusions on secondhand smoke in a sudden infant death syndrome review funded by the tobacco industry |journal=Pediatrics |volume=115 |issue=3 |pages=e356–66 |year=2005 |pmid=15741361 |doi=10.1542/peds.2004-1922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 U.S. Surgeon General's report criticized the tobacco industry's role in the scientific debate:

{{quote|The industry has funded or carried out research that has been judged to be biased, supported scientists to generate letters to editors that criticized research publications, attempted to undermine the findings of key studies, assisted in establishing a scientific society with a journal, and attempted to sustain controversy even as the scientific community reached consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke |publisher = [[Surgeon General of the United States]] |website = Executive Summary |year = 2006 |accessdate =2009-01-28 |url = http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/secondhandsmoke/report/executivesummary.pdf |format = PDF |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This strategy was outlined at an international meeting of tobacco companies in 1988, at which Philip Morris proposed to set up a team of scientists, organized by company lawyers, to "carry out work on ETS to keep the controversy alive."&lt;ref name="whitecoat"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://tobaccodocuments.org/landman/2063791182-1187.html |title = Minutes of a meeting of Philip Morris with British tobacco companies to discuss tobacco-industry strategy on passive smoking |accessdate = 2007-08-27 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013185238/http://tobaccodocuments.org/landman/2063791182-1187.html |archivedate = 2007-10-13 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; All scientific research was subject to oversight and "filtering" by tobacco-industry lawyers:

{{quote
|Philip Morris then expect the group of scientists to operate within the confines of decisions taken by PM scientists to determine the general direction of research, which apparently would then be 'filtered' by lawyers to eliminate areas of sensitivity.&lt;ref name="whitecoat"/&gt;
}}

Philip Morris reported that it was putting "...vast amounts of funding into these projects... in attempting to coordinate and pay so many scientists on an international basis to keep the ETS controversy alive."&lt;ref name="whitecoat"/&gt;

===Tobacco industry response===
Measures to tackle second-hand smoke pose a serious economic threat to the tobacco industry, having broadened the definition of smoking beyond a personal habit to something with a social impact. In a confidential 1978 report, the tobacco industry described increasing public concerns about second-hand smoke as "the most dangerous development to the viability of the tobacco industry that has yet occurred."&lt;ref&gt;[http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/qra99d00 A Study of Public Attitudes toward Cigarette Smoking and the Tobacco Industry in 1978], produced for the Tobacco Institute and released under the terms of the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]].&lt;/ref&gt; In ''United States of America v. Philip Morris et al.'', the District Court for the District of Columbia found that the tobacco industry "... recognized from the mid-1970s forward that the health effects of passive smoking posed a profound threat to industry viability and cigarette profits," and that the industry responded with "efforts to undermine and discredit the scientific consensus that ETS causes disease."&lt;ref name="kessler"/&gt;

Accordingly, the tobacco industry have developed several strategies to minimise the impact on their business:
* The industry has sought to position the second-hand smoke debate as essentially concerned with civil liberties and [[smokers' rights]] rather than with health, by funding groups such as [[FOREST]].&lt;ref name="voice-smoker"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith EA, Malone RE |title='We will speak as the smoker': the tobacco industry's smokers' rights groups |journal=Eur J Public Health |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=306–13 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17065174 |doi=10.1093/eurpub/ckl244 |url=http://eurpub.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/17/3/306 |pmc=2794244 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Funding bias]] in research;&lt;ref name="smoke-screen"/&gt; in all reviews of the effects of second-hand smoke on health published between 1980 and 1995, the only factor associated with concluding that second-hand smoke is not harmful was whether an author was affiliated with the tobacco industry.&lt;ref name="pmid9605902"/&gt;  However, not all studies that failed to find evidence of harm were by industry-affiliated authors.
* Delaying and discrediting legitimate research (see&lt;ref name="smoke-screen"/&gt; for an example of how the industry attempted to discredit [[Takeshi Hirayama]]'s landmark study, and&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Trotter L, Chapman S |title="Conclusions about exposure to ETS and health that will be unhelpful to us"*: How the tobacco industry attempted to delay and discredit the 1997 Australian National Health and Medical Research Council report on passive smoking |journal=Tob Control |volume=12 |issue=Suppl 3:iii |pages=102–6 |year=2003 |pmid=14645955 |doi=10.1136/tc.12.suppl_3.iii102 |pmc=1766130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for an example of how it attempted to delay and discredit a major Australian report on passive smoking)
* Promoting "good epidemiology" and attacking so-called [[junk science]] (a term popularised by industry lobbyist [[Steven Milloy]]): attacking the methodology behind research showing health risks as flawed and attempting to promote [[sound science]]. Ong &amp; Glantz (2001) cite an internal Phillip Morris memo giving evidence of this as company policy.&lt;ref name="pmid11684593"/&gt;
* Creation of outlets for favourable research. In 1989, the tobacco industry established the International Society of the Built Environment, which published the [[peer-reviewed]] journal ''Indoor and Built Environment''. This journal did not require conflict-of-interest disclosures from its authors. With documents made available through the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement|Master Settlement]], it was found that the executive board of the society and the editorial board of the journal were dominated by paid tobacco-industry consultants. The journal published a large amount of material on passive smoking, much of which was "industry-positive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Garne D, Watson M, Chapman S, Byrne F |title=Environmental tobacco smoke research published in the journal Indoor and Built Environment and associations with the tobacco industry |journal=Lancet |volume=365 |issue=9461 |pages=804–9 |year=2005 |pmid=15733724 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)17990-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing the tobacco industry's production of biased research and efforts to undermine scientific findings, the 2006 U.S. Surgeon General's report concluded that the industry had "attempted to sustain controversy even as the scientific community reached consensus... industry documents indicate that the tobacco industry has engaged in widespread activities... that have gone beyond the bounds of accepted scientific practice."&lt;ref name="sg-exec-summary"/&gt; The U.S. District Court, in ''U.S.A. v. Philip Morris et al.'', found that "...despite their internal acknowledgment of the hazards of secondhand smoke, Defendants have fraudulently denied that ETS causes disease."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kessler|2006|p=1523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Position of major tobacco companies ====
The positions of major tobacco companies on the issue of second-hand smoke is somewhat varied. In general, tobacco companies have continued to focus on questioning the methodology of studies showing that second-hand smoke is harmful. Some (such as [[British American Tobacco]] and [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]]) acknowledge the medical consensus that second-hand smoke carries health risks, while others continue to assert that the evidence is inconclusive. Several tobacco companies advocate the creation of smoke-free areas within public buildings as an alternative to comprehensive [[smoking bans|smoke-free laws]].&lt;ref&gt;The most current positions of major tobacco companies on the issue of passive smoking can be found on their websites. As of 13 January 2009, the following websites contain tobacco-industry positions on the topic:

=== US racketeering lawsuit against tobacco companies ===
On September 22, 1999, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] filed a [[racketeering]] lawsuit against Philip Morris and other major cigarette manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/civil/cases/tobacco2/index.htm Litigation Against Tobacco Companies] U.S. Department of Justice&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 7 years later, on August 17, 2006 U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler found that the Government had proven its case and that the tobacco company defendants had violated the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO)]].&lt;ref name="kessler" /&gt; In particular, Judge Kessler found that PM and other tobacco companies had:
* conspired to minimize, distort and confuse the public about the health hazards of smoking;
* publicly denied, while internally acknowledging, that second-hand tobacco smoke is harmful to nonsmokers, and
* destroyed documents relevant to litigation.
The ruling found that tobacco companies undertook joint efforts to undermine and discredit the scientific consensus that second-hand smoke causes disease, notably by controlling research findings via paid consultants. The ruling also concluded that tobacco companies were fraudulently continuing to deny the health effects of ETS exposure.&lt;ref name="kessler" /&gt;

On May 22, 2009, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the lower court's 2006 ruling.&lt;ref name="rico-appeal"&gt;[http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200905/06-5267-1181914.pdf Appeal Ruling], U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, 22 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aTHJN4mM4M3I Altria, Cigarette Makers Lose 'Lights' Ruling Appeal] Bloomberg news, 22 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE54L44820090522?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=10531&amp;sp=true U.S. appeals court agrees tobacco companies lied] Reuters, 22 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Smoke-free laws ==
{{See also|Smoking ban|List of smoking bans|Smoking bans in private vehicles}}

As a consequence of the health risks associated with second-hand smoke, [[smoking bans|smoke-free regulations]] in indoor public places, including [[restaurant]]s, [[café]]s, and [[nightclub]]s have been introduced in a number of jurisdictions, at national or local level, as well as some outdoor open areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gothamist.com/2011/05/18/smokers_just_daring_bloomberg_to_ti.php Smokers Daring Bloomberg To Ticket Them Under Park Ban] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126094031/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/18/smokers_just_daring_bloomberg_to_ti.php |date=2013-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ireland]] was the first country in the world to institute a comprehensive national smoke-free law on smoking in all indoor workplaces on 29 March 2004. Since then, many others have followed suit. The countries which have ratified the [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] (FCTC) have a legal obligation to implement ''effective'' legislation "for protection from exposure to tobacco smoke in indoor workplaces, public transport, indoor public places and, as appropriate, other public places." (Article 8 of the FCTC&lt;ref name="framework-treaty"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2003/9241591013.pdf |title = WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control |publisher = [[World Health Organization]] |quote = Parties recognize that scientific evidence has unequivocally established that exposure to tobacco causes death, disease and disability |date = 2005-02-27 |accessdate = 2009-01-12 |format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The parties to the FCTC have further adopted ''Guidelines on the Protection from Exposure to Second-hand Smoke'' which state that "effective measures to provide protection from exposure to tobacco smoke ... require the total elimination of smoking and tobacco smoke in a particular space or environment in order to create a 100% smoke-free environment."&lt;ref name="fctc-guidelines"&gt;{{cite web |title = Guidelines on the Protection from Exposure to Secondhand Smoke |website = [[WHO Framework Convention for Tobacco Control|Framework Convention for Tobacco Control]] |publisher = [[World Health Organization]] |year = 2007 |accessdate =2009-01-29 |url = http://www.who.int/fctc/cop/art%208%20guidelines_english.pdf |format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinion polls have shown considerable support for smoke-free laws. In June 2007, a survey of 15 countries found 80% approval for smoke-free laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketresearchworld.net/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1619&amp;Itemid= Market Research World]&lt;/ref&gt; A survey in France, reputedly a nation of smokers, showed 70% support.&lt;ref name="France to ban smoking"/&gt;

In 2001, a systematic review for the Guide to Community Preventative Services acknowledged strong evidence of the effectiveness of smoke-free policies and restrictions in reducing expose to second-hand smoke. A follow up to this review, identified the evidence on which the effectiveness of smoking bans reduced the prevalence of tobacco use. Articles published until 2005, were examined to further support this evidence. The examined studies provided sufficient evidence that smoke-free policies reduce tobacco use among workers when implemented in worksites or by communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hopkins DP, Razi S, Leeks KD, Priya Kalra G, Chattopadhyay SK, Soler RE | year = 2010 | title = Smokefree policies to reduce tobacco use.

While a number of studies funded by the tobacco industry have claimed a negative economic impact from smoke-free laws, no independently funded research has shown any such impact. A 2003 review reported that independently funded, methodologically sound research consistently found either no economic impact or a positive impact from smoke-free laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scollo M, Lal A, Hyland A, Glantz S |title=Review of the quality of studies on the economic effects of smoke-free policies on the hospitality industry |journal=Tobacco Control |date=Mar 2003 |pmid=12612356 |pmc=1759095 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=13–20 |doi=10.1136/tc.12.1.13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air nicotine levels were measured in Guatemalan bars and restaurants before and after an implemented smoke-free law in 2009. Nicotine concentrations significantly decreased in both the bars and restaurants measured. Also, the employees support for a smoke-free workplace substantially increased in the post-implementation survey compared to pre-implementation survey. The result of this smoke-free law provides a considerably more healthy work environment for the staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barnoya J, Arvizu M, Jones MR, Hernandez JC, Breysse PN, Navas-Acien A |title=Secondhand smoke exposure in bars and restaurants in Guatemala City: before and after smoking ban evaluation |journal=Cancer Causes Control |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=151–6 |date=November 2010 |pmid=21046446 |doi=10.1007/s10552-010-9673-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public opinion ===
Recent surveys taken by the [[Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco]] demonstrates supportive attitudes of the public, towards smoke-free policies in outdoor areas. A vast majority of the public supports restricting smoking in various outdoor settings. The respondents reasons for supporting the policies were for varying reasons such as, litter control, establishing positive smoke-free role models for youth, reducing youth opportunities to smoke, and avoiding exposure to secondhand smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thomson G, Wilson N, Edwards R |title=At the frontier of tobacco control: a brief review of public attitudes toward smoke-free outdoor places |journal=Nicotine Tob. Res. |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=584–90 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19359392 |doi=10.1093/ntr/ntp046 |url=http://ntr.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19359392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative forms ===
Alternatives to smoke-free laws have also been proposed as a means of [[harm reduction]], particularly in bars and restaurants. For example, critics of smoke-free laws cite studies suggesting ventilation as a means of reducing tobacco smoke pollutants and improving air quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website = Building Sustainable Design |url = http://www.bsjonline.co.uk/story.asp?storyType=85&amp;sectioncode=95&amp;storyCode=3047478 |title = No ifs or butts |date = March 2005 |accessdate = 2009-01-28 |first = Andrew |last = Geens |author2 = Max Graham |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090106002930/http://www.bsjonline.co.uk/story.asp?storyType=85&amp;sectioncode=95&amp;storyCode=3047478 |archivedate = 2009-01-06 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ventilation has also been heavily promoted by the tobacco industry as an alternative to outright bans, via a network of ostensibly independent experts with often undisclosed ties to the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Drope J, Bialous SA, Glantz SA |title=Tobacco industry efforts to present ventilation as an alternative to smoke-free environments in North America |journal=Tob Control |volume=13 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=i41–7 |date=March 2004 |pmid=14985616 |pmc=1766145 |doi= 10.1136/tc.2003.004101|url=http://tc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14985616 |quote = The industry developed a network of ventilation 'experts' to promote its position that smoke-free environments were not necessary, often without disclosing the financial relationship between these experts and the industry. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all critics have connections to the industry.

The [[American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers]] (ASHRAE) officially concluded in 2005 that while completely isolated smoking rooms do eliminate the risk to nearby non-smoking areas, smoking bans are the only means of completely eliminating health risks associated with indoor exposure.  They further concluded that no system of dilution or cleaning was effective at eliminating risk.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ashrae.org/content/ASHRAE/ASHRAE/ArticleAltFormat/20058211239_347.pdf |format = PDF |publisher = [[American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers]] |date = June 30, 2005 |accessdate = 2009-01-28 |title = Environmental Tobacco Smoke: Position Document |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090327101819/http://www.ashrae.org/content/ASHRAE/ASHRAE/ArticleAltFormat/20058211239_347.pdf |archivedate = March 27, 2009 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Surgeon General]] and the [[European Commission Joint Research Centre]] have reached similar conclusions.&lt;ref name="sg-exec-summary"&gt;{{cite web |title = The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke |publisher = [[Surgeon General of the United States]] |website = Executive Summary |year = 2006 |accessdate =2009-01-28 |url = http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/secondhandsmoke/report/executivesummary.pdf |format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ecjrc"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Commission]] [[Joint Research Centre]] |title=Institute for Health and Consumer Protection Activity Report 2003 |year=2003 |url=http://ihcp.jrc.ec.europa.eu/docs/IHCP_annual_report/ihcp03.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327101821/http://ihcp.jrc.ec.europa.eu/docs/IHCP_annual_report/ihcp03.pdf |archivedate=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation guidelines for the [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] states that engineering approaches, such as ventilation, are ineffective and do not protect against second-hand smoke exposure.&lt;ref name="fctc-guidelines" /&gt; However, this does ''not'' necessarily mean that such measures are useless in reducing harm, only that they fall short of the goal of reducing exposure completely to zero.

Others have suggested a system of [[tradable smoking pollution permits]], similar to the [[emissions trading|cap-and-trade]] pollution permits systems used by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] in recent decades to curb other types of pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Let Bars Buy, Sell Smoking Permits |url = http://www.madison.com/archives/read.php?ref=/madison.com/html/archive_files/wsj/2005/09/25/0509240280.php |first = Robert |last = Haveman |author2 = John Mullahy |work = [[Wisconsin State Journal]] |date = September 25, 2005 |accessdate = 2009-01-28 |page = B2 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090104145317/http://www.madison.com/archives/read.php?ref=%2Fmadison.com%2Fhtml%2Farchive_files%2Fwsj%2F2005%2F09%2F25%2F0509240280.php |archivedate = January 4, 2009 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would guarantee that a portion of bars/restaurants in a jurisdiction will be smoke-free, while leaving the decision to the market.

==In animals==
{{main|Animals and tobacco smoke}}

Multiple studies have been conducted to determine the carcinogenicity of environmental tobacco smoke to animals. These studies typically fall under the categories of simulated environmental tobacco smoke, administering condensates of [[sidestream smoke]], or observational studies of cancer among pets.

To simulate environmental tobacco smoke, scientists expose animals to sidestream smoke, that which emanates from the cigarette's burning cone and through its paper, or a combination of mainstream and sidestream smoke.&lt;ref name=IARC2004/&gt; The IARC monographs conclude that mice with prolonged exposure to simulated environmental tobacco smoke, that is 6hrs a day, 5 days a week, for five months with a subsequent 4 month interval before dissection, will have significantly higher incidence and multiplicity of lung tumors than with control groups.

The IARC monographs concluded that sidestream smoke condensates had a significantly higher carcinogenic effect on mice than did mainstream smoke condensates.&lt;ref name=IARC2004/&gt;

===Observational studies===
Second-hand smoke is popularly recognised as a risk factor for cancer in pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.livescience.com/animals/070831_pets_smoking.html |title = Secondhand Smoke Causes Cancer in Pets |first = Andrea |last = Thompson |publisher = LiveScience |date = 2007-08-31 |accessdate = 2007-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by the [[Tufts University|Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine]] and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] linked the occurrence of feline oral cancer to exposure to environmental tobacco smoke through an [[overexpression]] of the [[p53]] gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Snyder LA, Bertone ER, Jakowski RM, Dooner MS, Jennings-Ritchie J, Moore AS |title=p53 expression and environmental tobacco smoke exposure in feline oral squamous cell carcinoma |journal=Vet Pathol |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=209–14 |year=2004 |pmid=15133168 |doi=10.1354/vp.41-3-209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study conducted at the same universities concluded that cats living with a smoker were more likely to get [[feline lymphoma]]; the risk increased with the duration of exposure to secondhand smoke and the number of smokers in the household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Bertone ER, Snyder LA, Moore AS |title= Environmental Tobacco Smoke and Risk of Malignant Lymphoma in Pet Cats |journal=American Journal of Epidemiology |volume=156 |issue=3 |pages=268–273 |year=2002 |pmid=12142262 |doi= 10.1093/aje/kwf044 |ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by [[Colorado State University]] researchers, looking at cases of canine lung cancer, was generally inconclusive, though the authors reported a weak relation for lung cancer in dogs exposed to environmental tobacco smoke. The number of smokers within the home, the number of packs smoked in the home per day, and the amount of time that the dog spent within the home had no effect on the dog's risk for lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reif JS, Dunn K, Ogilvie GK, Harris CK |title=Passive smoking and canine lung cancer risk |journal=Am J Epidemiol |volume=135 |issue=3 |pages=234–9 |year=1992 |pmid=1546698 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a116276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
As of 2003, "secondhand smoke" was the term most used to refer to other people's smoke in the English-language media.&lt;ref name=chapman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chapman|first1=S.|title=Other people's smoke: what's in a name?|journal=Tobacco Control|date=1 June 2003|volume=12|issue=2|pages=113–4|doi=10.1136/tc.12.2.113 |pmid=12773710 |url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/12/2/113.full|pmc=1747703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms used include "environmental tobacco smoke", while "involuntary smoking" and "passive smoking" are used to refer to exposure to secondhand smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.epa.gov/smokefree/healtheffects.html | title=Health Effects of Exposure to Secondhand Smoke | publisher=EPA | accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "environmental tobacco smoke" can be traced back to a 1974 industry-sponsored meeting held in [[Bermuda]], while the term "passive smoking" was first used in the title of a scientific paper in 1970.&lt;ref name=chapman/&gt; The [[Surgeon General of the United States]] prefers to use the phrase "secondhand smoke" rather than "environmental tobacco smoke", stating that "The descriptor "secondhand" captures the involuntary nature of the exposure, while "environmental" does not."&lt;ref name="sg-report"/&gt;{{rp|9}} Most researchers consider the term "passive smoking" to be synonymous with "secondhand smoke".&lt;ref name=protano/&gt; In contrast, a 2011 commentary in ''[[Environmental Health Perspectives]]'' argued that research into "thirdhand smoke" renders it inappropriate to refer to passive smoking with the term "secondhand smoke", which the authors stated constitutes a [[pars pro toto]].&lt;ref name=protano&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Protano|first1=Carmela|last2=Vitali|first2=Matteo|title=The New Danger of Thirdhand Smoke: Why Passive Smoking Does Not Stop at Secondhand Smoke|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=1 October 2011|volume=119|issue=10|pages=a422|doi=10.1289/ehp.1103956 |pmid=21968336 |pmc=3230455 |url=https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1103956/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pathway''' is a [[Volunteering|voluntary]], [[Charitable organization|charitable]], [[nonprofit]] and [[non-governmental organisation]], based in Chennai, India - which serves children and adults without any bias to religion, [[caste]], creed, or any other consideration. Founded in 1975 by [[Dr. ADSN Prasad]], now provides services to children with mental and learning disabilities, adult mental handicap, and orphaned and destitute children of rural south India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/mad.asp?fodname=20000703&amp;fname=making_a_difference.htm&amp;sid=0 Mentally Disabled Kids Find A Voice At This Pathway] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611210518/http://www.outlookindia.com/mad.asp?fodname=20000703&amp;fname=making_a_difference.htm&amp;sid=0 |date=2011-06-11 }} Outlook India, 11 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission== 
Guided by Dr. ADSN Prasad's philosophy - "Every individual should be given the opportunity to utilise their potential in order to live with dignity and self-respect, regardless of mental or physical limitations", Pathway seeks to serve the poorest of the poor by providing the best

==History==
Pathway began in 1975 with just two children in a small, rented house in Chennai, India.  sought to fill the void existing in the care and rehabilitation of mentally ill children. From these humble beginnings grew an organisation that has served almost 22,000 children and adults in two city centers and a rural agricultural farm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2006/05/11/stories/2006051101340500.htm Beads bind their lives] ''The Hindu'', Metro Plus Chennai, 11 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
'''1. Pathway Centre for Rehabilitation &amp; Education of the Mentally Retarded - Chennai'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''2. Pathway Centre for Vocational Training &amp; Education - Koothavakkam'''

Purpose of the above two facilities is to provide comprehensive care and educational opportunities for mentally ill children. Pathway is founded on the philosophy that every individual should be given the opportunity to utilise their potential in order to live with dignity and self-respect, regardless of mental or physical limitations. Today over 100 children receive full care at the live-in facility, while another 300 children are seen on daily basis for rehabilitation and educational programmes.

In Pathway, all children are served for free, without any charges. Prior to being admitted to the centre's Day or Residential program, each child is thoroughly screened and evaluated to assess their level of mental, neurological and physical development. These methods of testing and observation assist in designing a special education and vocational programme for each child.

Pathway's goal is to offer medical care, special education and vocational training to as many mentally and physically disabled children and adults as possible. During the last 27 years Pathway has served more than 14,000 children and adults with various problems and disabilities.

'''3. Pamela M.Martinez/Pathway Agro-Farm For Children''' &lt;br /&gt;
Pamela Martinez/Pathway Agro Farm for Children named after its donor is located in a large {{convert|60|acre|m2|adj=on}} agro farm in Agili, Madhuranthakam Taluk, Kancheepuram District. This farm houses a large orphanage, home to more than 200 children, a well organised and well run English medium Matriculation Residential school, recognised by the Directorate of Matriculation Schools, Govt. of Tamil Nadu. The children are offered high class facilities such as swimming, yoga, music, good recreational facilities, quality education, total medical care, etc. in an eco-friendly environment. A "HOSPITAL ON WHEELS" is also run from this facility serving a large number of poor villagers around the agro farm.

The organisation has great plans to help hundreds of needy children in all ways, we need your help in our humble endeavour. This facility will be the first one to use agriculture as a major medium of therapy and it can offer a rare opportunity to children to grow their own food and learn to use modern cultivating techniques.

This facility is planned to assist the disabled and disadvantaged children of India.

'''Perichondritis'''  is inflammation of the [[perichondrium]], a layer of [[connective tissue]] which surrounds [[cartilage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|six/000080312|Perichondritis}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common form, auricular perichondritis (''perichondritis auriculae'') involves infection of the [[pinna (anatomy)|pinna]] due to infection of traumatic or surgical wound or the spread of inflammation into depth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001253.htm Medline Plus description of Perichondritis of the outer ear]&lt;/ref&gt; It may lead to severe deformation of the pinna if not treated vigorously with IV antibiotics. The causative organism is usually ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''. A rare form is laryngeal perichondritis (''perichondritis laryngis''). It develops suddenly due to an injury, virulent organisms or compromised [[immune status]] of the host, and also affects cartilage of the [[larynx]]. This may result in deformations and stenoses.

== Clinical Presentation ==
Intense pain in auricle. [[Auricle (anatomy)|Auricle]]s become red and thick. Body temperature rises. In serious cases pus appears between the [[perichondrium]] and [[Cartilage|cartillage]]. Purulent melting of auricular cartilage takes place. Dead tissue tears away, as a result auricle deforms strongly and becomes shrunken.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1528">A '''potentiometric surface''' is the imaginary plane where a given [[reservoir]] of fluid will "equalize out to" if allowed to flow. A potentiometric surface is based on [[hydraulic]] principles. For example, we know that two connected storage tanks with one full and one empty will gradually fill/drain to the same level. This is because of atmospheric pressure and gravity. This idea is heavily used in city water supplies - a tall [[water tower]] containing the [[water supply]] has a great enough potentiometric surface to provide flowing water at a decent pressure to the houses it supplies.

For [[groundwater]] "potentiometric surface" is a synonym of "piezometric surface" which is an imaginary surface that defines the level to which water in a [[confined aquifer]] would rise were it completely pierced with [[water well|wells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Younger|first=Paul|title=Groundwater in the Environment|date=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-1-4051-2143-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the potentiometric surface lies above the ground surface, a flowing [[artesian well]] results. [[Contour maps]] and profiles of the potentiometric surface can be prepared from the well data.

'''Richard B. Riddick''', more commonly known as '''Riddick''', is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and the [[antiheroic]] [[protagonist]] of the [[The Chronicles of Riddick (franchise)|''Riddick'' series]] (''[[Pitch Black (film)|Pitch Black]]'', ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick]]'', the animated movie ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury]]'', and ''[[Riddick (film)|Riddick]]''), as well as the two video games ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay]]'' and ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena]]''. Actor [[Vin Diesel]] has played the [[title role]] in all of the Riddick-based films and video games so far.
&lt;!--PITCHBLACK: Slam City has that capitalization and no space.--&gt;

Within the canon of the series, Riddick is shown to be a highly skilled predator—he is extremely mobile and stealthy - especially for someone of his size, has a vast knowledge of how to kill almost any humanoid in a variety of ways, is an extreme survivalist, and is notoriously hard to contain. He is also self-admittedly a dangerous convict and murderer—yet despite this, he is sometimes shown to perform moral or even atypically heroic actions, usually against his own better judgment and survivalist nature.

Riddick is a Human/Furyan hybrid, a member of a warrior race obliterated by a military campaign that left Furya desolate, and is one of the last of his kind. One of his most defining features are his eyes, a characteristic inherent in a certain caste of his species (the Alpha-Furyans), although he implies in ''Pitch Black'' that they were "shined" by a back-alley surgical operation. This allows him to see clearly in the dark, but also makes him vulnerable to strong light; he wears tinted [[welding goggles]] for protection.

Riddick was once a mercenary, then part of a security force,&lt;ref name="ChroniclesDVD"&gt;''The Chronicles of Riddick'', Special Features&lt;/ref&gt; and later a soldier. He is also an experienced pilot.

==Biography ==
===Early life===
Riddick was born on Furya. Before Riddick's birth, a Necromonger officer named [[The Chronicles of Riddick (series)#Zhylaw/Lord Marshal|Zhylaw]] (who would eventually become the Lord Marshall) consulted an Elemental seer, who told him that a [[Furyan]] male would be born that would be responsible for his downfall. This prompted Zhylaw to attack Furya and attempt to massacre all male children, going so far as to personally strangle newborn infants with their own umbilical cords. Riddick was among those presumably strangled, but he survived.

In later life, Riddick repressed his memories of Furya, including those of the massacre. He came to believe that when he was born, his mother attempted to strangle him and left him in a trash bin behind a [[liquor store]]. Despite this, he periodically received visions and messages from a Furyan survivor named Shirah, which he thought were signs of mental instability.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Little is known about Riddick's childhood, save that he had no formal education and seemed to have been in trouble with the law from an early age. He claims to have been "educated" in the penal system.

===''Pitch Black''===
{{Main|Pitch Black (film)}}
In the premiere installment in the franchise, Riddick is introduced as notorious convict en route to a penal institution with his captor, a bounty hunter named William J. Johns. By impersonating a cop and traveling with a group of settlers aboard the nondescript transport cruiser ''Hunter Gratzner'', Johns hopes to safely convey Riddick back to a prison colony and collect the outlaw's enormous bounty. However, the ship inadvertently passes through a comet's tail while on autopilot, forcing it to crash land on an unknown planet with three suns. Soon the survivors find themselves fighting for their lives against a predatory species called Bio-Raptors, and by the end of the film there are only three survivors: Riddick, a young girl called Jack, and Imam.

===''The Chronicles of Riddick''===
{{Main|The Chronicles of Riddick}}
Five years later, Riddick has remained in hiding on an [[Arctic]] planet called U.V. for its harsh [[Ultraviolet]] light. Meanwhile, Imam, learning that his own planet, Helion Prime,  will be invaded by the twisted religious crusade of the Necromongers, recalls the story Riddick told him of his Furyan origins, and betrays Riddick's location to the Helion Prime leaders. Initially, Riddick is reluctant to become involved in the struggle between the Necromongers and the world they seek to conquer. But when Imam is killed, Riddick sets out on a mission to avenge him, eventually overthrowing the Lord Marshal (with help from Jack, who dies in the process) and inheriting his office.&lt;ref&gt;simply read original article and watched the series&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Riddick''===
{{Main|Riddick (film)}}
Dissatisfied with his role as Lord Marshal, Riddick attempts to find Furya, but is instead abandoned on a desolate planet. After spending some time on this world, Riddick finds that he will soon be overtaken by a vicious storm that provides cover for countless predators.  Using the communication system from a mercenary outpost, Riddick lures two ships to the planet, intending to commandeer one of them; but his plan is complicated when he finds that one of the arriving mercenaries is the father of his old enemy, Johns the bounty hunter. Riddick uses the approaching storm to force the mercenaries to cooperate, but he is left surrounded by enemies and nearly killed. To his surprise, the elder Johns rescues him and allows him to leave. Riddick praises Johns for being a better man than his son.

==Powers and abilities==
===Eyeshine===
{{See also|Tapetum lucidum}}
According to Riddick, while in Butcher Bay he received [[eye surgery]] (a "surgical shine job", as he calls it) from a doctor who gave him permanent [[night vision]] in exchange for "20 [[menthol]] [[Kool (cigarette)|KOOL]]s". The surgery made his eyes more sensitive to normal light, requiring him to wear welding goggles to protect them (although he has also been shown without the goggles in a regularly illuminated room).

In the flash movie on the Pitchblack.com website, Riddick gets the eye-shine to give him more of an advantage following an encounter with humanoids called "shiners". Referring to Riddick as "darkeye", they have had the same operation to see in the dark bowels of the Ursa Luna prison where the guards do not tend to go. The eye-shine surgery seems to be performed by a bovine veterinarian on board a prison facility where Riddick arrived only a few hours before and from which he is already in the process of escaping.  Riddick elects to have no anesthetic, despite the procedure involving cutting the cornea and drilling through the eye to inject a reflective substance behind the retina.  The cost quoted to Riddick is 1000 creds. Having no cash, Riddick offers down payment of a pack of Kool cigarettes which he earlier took from a guard. He also takes some welder's goggles from the facility.

The video game, ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay]]'' (which serves as a prequel to ''Pitch Black''), clarifies that Riddick's eyeshine is more than just something he picked up in a prison. After helping a character called "Pope Joe" retrieve his "blessed voice box", a radio that picks up religious programming (including a Necromonger [[Talk Show]]), Riddick goes into a den to get stitches for an injury. After he is finished receiving stitches, Joe tells him how to escape, and, perhaps coincidentally, warns Riddick not to "trust [his] eyes"; at that moment, a ghostly voice informs Riddick that he has "been blind for far too long..." and that he is to receive a gift. It is at this moment that Riddick receives his eyeshine. The mysterious voice belongs to a character named "Shirah", who appears to serve as a sort of spiritual guide to Riddick, helping him awaken the Furyan abilities that lie dormant within him.  In the ''Chronicles of Riddick'' film, Jack/Kyra angrily tells Riddick that when she was sent to prison, she found out that it is impossible to find anyone who can perform a "surgical shine job" at any price, and accuses him of lying about how he received his night vision.

Light amplification surgery, somewhat similar in effect to Riddick's eyeshine, has been patented in real life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16315-invention-vision-amplifier.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&amp;nsref=invention New Scientist - Vision Amplifier]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?WO=2008106605 METHOD FOR STIMULATING RETINAL RESPONSE USING PHOTOACTIVE DEVICES]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wrath of the Furyans===
Aside from helping Riddick unlock his eyeshine, the character Shirah also either allows or helps Riddick discover his ability to unleash a sort of energy wave. It is shown in the director's cut of ''The Chronicles of Riddick'' after she lays her hand on Riddick's chest, leaving a glowing blue hand print, and says, "this mark carries the anger of an entire race... but it's going to hurt". After either receiving a shot from Vaako's energy handgun or a fraction of a second before the discharge of said weapon, she immediately emits a large blast of blue energy from Riddick (or Riddick himself does so with her guidance), leaving the group of surrounding [[The Necromonger Way|Necromongers]] dead. This ability is also displayed off screen in ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay|Escape from Butcher Bay]]''.

===Physical abilities===
Aside from his more supernatural skills, Riddick is in superlative physical condition and is an exceptional fighter with or without the use of his eyes. Whether as a result of his Furyan heritage or simply training, Riddick is stronger, faster, more agile, tougher, more resistant to damage and injury, possessing more acute senses, immense stamina, and superior healing when compared to most humans; he is shown on more than one occasion dislocating his limbs for brief moments with only slight signs of discomfort, although he was in more obvious pain when his leg was broken in a fall, and had to use a heated rock to cauterize a wound when he was impaled in the chest by a creature's sharpened tooth. In general, Riddick possesses an abnormally high [[threshold of pain]] and psychologically channels what pain he does feel into anger. His ability to cope with toxins is also heightened; when a merc team was attempting to take him out with [[horse]] [[tranquilizers]], it took four darts just to make Riddick stop running, and he still remained conscious until he was hit in the head. His ability to cope with pain, stress and situational panic is most likely the main reason behind his success, which combined with his sharp intelligence gives Riddick the ability to escape from any situation.

Riddick's abilities at [[hand-to-hand combat]] is a mix of '''[[Krav Maga]]''', '''[[Hapkido]]''', '''[[Eskrima]]''', and '''[[Ninjutsu]]'''; he uses his formidable fighting skills while confronting one of the night-creatures of ''Pitch Black'' with only his bare hands and a [[Shiv (weapon)|shiv]] he had made, killing it with relative ease, as well as defeating one of the Lord Marshall's best Necromonger warriors in a matter of seconds in ''Chronicles''.  Also, he was able to hold off the Lord Marshall and even injure him which the Lord Marshall admitted hadn't happened in a long time.  While Riddick was no match for him in speed, he was able to hold off the Lord Marshall for several minutes.

===Intelligence===
Despite his harsh upbringing and violent attitude, Riddick has been shown to have a certain knack for [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], rapidly deducing what had happened to the original inhabitants of the mining base where he and the other crash survivors had been staying, as well as finding the creature's blind spot in ''Pitch Black'' and swiftly deducing what had caused the firefight between the Warden's and Toombs' men in ''The Chronicles of Riddick''. He has also been described as having "a knack for escape", surviving not only the Lord Marshall's purge of the Furyans when he was an infant but subsequently escaping from various prisons over the course of his life. He is also able to quickly judge the quality of, and find even seemingly minor flaws in most weaponry, down to very specific details. In one case, Riddick concluded that the prized dagger of a Necromonger was "a half gram too heavy on the back end" after an inspection lasting all of a couple of seconds, although the tone of voice in which he delivered this appraisal suggested pre-fight bravado rather than abstract fact. His only weakness (other than [[light sensitivity]], leaving him in pain when in daylight without his goggles), as stated in the ''[[Pitch Black (film)|Pitch Black]]'' [[DVD]], is his soft spot for children and anyone who really grows on him (those people become his friends), which resulted in his capture by the [[bounty hunter]] Johns ([[Cole Hauser]]). While he may be a ruthless killer when necessary, Riddick has never been shown to kill anyone who was not actively trying to kill him first, and has been known to help people in need only if they don't slow him down or make him vulnerable. The only exception to this was when, in ''Pitch Black'', he returned with Carolyn to help the others, after she pleaded with him. He also mentions on board the Dark Athena that people he helps often end up dead. In ''The Chronicles of Riddick'', he considered it an insult, when he discovered the bounty placed on him was around a million of the currency for most planets, and when Toombs has a small crew to capture him (it was originally four crew members, then it was five).

In addition to raw [[analytical skill|analytical]] power, Riddick is generally an astute judge of character, especially in the dark side of human nature. A killer himself and resident of several maximum security facilities, he is often able to predict an individual's negative impulses before they act on them. He has been known to be surprised on occasion, such as when Carolyn Fry in ''Pitch Black'' altruistically gave up a fast escape to save Jack and Imam from the alien creatures. Riddick was also surprised when he underestimated Jack's (Kyra's) affection toward him between ''Pitch Black'' and ''The Chronicles of Riddick'', only learning of it after she had become a mercenary and resident of a maximum security prison in order to see him once again. Otherwise, he correctly predicted which of the group in ''Pitch Black'' would turn on each other (in particular that Johns would try to double-cross Fry), and that the mercs and guards on Crematoria would turn on each other prior to his escape attempt. In ''Riddick'', he appeared pleasantly surprised to learn that Johns' father was a better man than his son, complimenting Johns' nerve when he came back to help Riddick when he didn't have to.

===Willpower===
One major characteristic of Riddick is his indomitable will.  Despite finding himself in situations where the odds of survival and/or escape would seem insurmountable, Riddick always pushes forward and never gives up.  Faced with several creatures far more powerful than himself, or any human for that matter, he has shown himself to be capable of evading, killing, or even taming them. He has escaped out of prisons when most prisoners would resign themselves to captivity. When Riddick was mentally probed by the Quasi-Dead of the Necromongers, he not only resisted them, but also retaliated, the Quasi-Dead's containers actually exploding from the strain of trying to process Riddick. Given the Necromongers' apparent faith in and respect for the power of the Quasi-Dead, this is a very impressive feat. Perhaps even greater was his ability to resist the Lord Marshall's attempt to steal his soul.  The one time his will seemed to waver was when Kyra was killed, sacrificing herself to save him and help him defeat the Lord Marshal, and even then he channeled his loss into new strength.

===Weapons===
Riddick is deadly with any weapon that he can get his hands on, but his weapon of choice is undoubtedly a knife. However, Riddick's most famous weapons are surely a pair of Ulak blades that he is seen using during his escape from Crematoria in ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick]]''.

He has also been known to use anything from Necromonger gravity rifles, teacups and anything in between. Riddick can also kill efficiently without using a weapon.  In the second film, he used the knife he took from Irgun as his weapon during his fight with him and the Lord Marshall, killing both with it. The third film sees him predominately relying on a bone-sword he made from the remains of a creature he had killed.

==Other appearances==
Riddick's first appearance outside ''Pitch Black'' was a guest appearance and potential recruit in ''[[Fallout Tactics]]''. He appears in the game during a random special encounter, aptly titled ''Pitch Black''. Like his movie origin, Riddick is a stealth focused melee fighter with advanced hand-to-hand fighting skills and the ability to see in the dark.

Riddick has appeared as a playable character in the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] game ''[[Deathrow (game)|Deathrow]]''. He is one of the final players available on the Convicts team and has the highest amount of strength and aggression of all recruitable Convict players, although he has the equal-lowest teamplay rating in the game.

Behind the scenes Richard B. Riddick first appeared in ''Pitch Black: Slam City'', a Shockwave prequel comic on the official ''Pitch Black'' website, one month before the release of the movie. In the film, and in all subsequent appearances the character has been portrayed by Vin Diesel.

In Jim and Ken Wheat's original script for ''Pitch Black'', the Riddick character was a woman named Taras Krieg.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2498">[[File:Rooftop water towers on New York apartment buildings.jpg|thumb|Rooftop water towers atop apartment buildings on [[East 57th Street]] in [[New York City]]. The structures seen here illustrate three architectural approaches to incorporating these tanks in the design of a building. From left to right, a fully enclosed and ornately decorated brick structure, a simple unadorned roofless brick structure hiding most of the tank but revealing the top of the tank, and a simple utilitarian structure that makes no effort to hide the tanks or otherwise incorporate them into the design of the building.]]

A '''rooftop water tower''' is a variant of a [[water tower]], consisting of a water container placed on the [[roof]] of a [[highrise|tall building]].

This structure supplies [[water pressure]] to floors at higher elevation than public water towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Joseph|first1=Sean|title=Water towers: NYC's misunderstood icons|url=http://www.amny.com/real-estate/city-living/water-towers-nyc-s-misunderstood-icons-1.6982696|accessdate=6 August 2016|work=amNewYork|date=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As building height increases, the vertical height of its [[plumbing]] also increases. This produces a large water column and the weight of this water produces very high [[pressure]] at the bottom of the column. Normally, this would require very thick (heavy schedule) plumbing to survive the pressure. Fittings at the bottom of the column would need pressure reducing valves to operate normally, and municipal water pressure would need to be very high to supply pressure to the top of the column.

Instead, the plumbing at various levels of the building are often sequestered, with pressure supplied from a rooftop water tower instead of the municipal supply. The tower itself is fed by a pump and a relatively high pressure line that carries water to the top of the building from the pipes below.

==Health hazards==

Many have not been cleaned or inspected in years and regulations governing water tanks are rarely enforced. E. coli and coliform can be found inside tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/nyregion/inside-citys-water-tanks-layers-of-neglect.html|title=Inside City’s Water Tanks, Layers of Neglect|last=Runyeon|first=Ray Rivera, Frank G.|date=2014-01-27|last2=Buettner|first2=Russ|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sein Myint''' ({{lang-my|စိန်မြင့်}}) is a Burmese politician and former [[political prisoner]] In the [[Burmese general election, 1990]], he was elected as an Pyithu Hluttaw member of parliament, winning a majority of 28,259 (55% of the votes), but was never allowed to assume his seat.&lt;ref name="kyh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs/Elections-03.htm|title=Brief Biographies of Elected MPs|last=Khin Kyaw Han|date=1 February 2003|work= 1990 Multi-party Democracy General Elections|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, he obtained a medical degree ([[MBBS]]) from the [[University of Medicine 1, Yangon|Rangoon Institute of Medicine]] and ran a private clinic from 1981 to 1989.&lt;ref name="kyh"/&gt;

From 9 August to 30 October 1989, he was sentenced to the [[Pathein|Bassein]] prison under the 1975 State Protection Act's Article 10a, for his involvement in organizing a trip by [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] to the [[Irrawaddy Division]].&lt;ref name="kyh"/&gt; From November 1991 to January 1992, he was arrested for allegedly participating in the [[Karen National Union]]'s underground movement.&lt;ref name="kyh"/&gt;

'''Sex cord tumour with annular tubules''', commonly referred to by its [[abbreviation]] '''SCTAT''', is a rare [[ovary|ovarian]] [[tumour]] in the [[sex cord]] group of [[gonad]]al tumours.  It may be spelled '''sex cord tumor with annular tubules'''.

==Pathobiology==
These tumours may be seen in the context of [[Peutz-Jeghers syndrome]] or be sporadic.&lt;ref name=pmid7358344&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Purohit | first1 = RC. | last2 = Alam | first2 = SZ. | title = Sex cord tumour of the ovary with annular tubules (SCTAT). | journal = Histopathology | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 147–54 |date=Mar 1980 | doi =  10.1111/j.1365-2559.1980.tb02908.x| PMID = 7358344 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Large tumours are more likely to be sporadic.  Small incidental tumours are more likely to be syndromic.

It has a distinctive appearance under the [[microscope]], from which it derives its name.

'''Statistical inference''' is the process of using [[data analysis]] to deduce properties of an underlying [[probability distribution]].&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;Upton, G., Cook, I. (2008) ''Oxford Dictionary of Statistics'', OUP. {{isbn|978-0-19-954145-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a [[Statistical population|population]], for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates.  It is assumed that the observed data set is [[Sampling (statistics)|sampled]] from a larger population.

Inferential statistics can be contrasted with [[descriptive statistics]]. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population.

== Introduction ==
Statistical inference makes propositions about a population, using data drawn from the population with some form of [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]]. Given a hypothesis about a population, for which we wish to draw inferences, statistical inference consists of (first) [[Model selection|selecting]] a [[statistical model]] of the process that generates the data and (second) deducing propositions from the model.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Konishi &amp; Kitagawa state, "The majority of the problems in statistical inference can be considered to be problems related to statistical modeling".&lt;ref&gt;Konishi &amp; Kitagawa (2008), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relatedly, [[David Cox (statistician)|Sir David Cox]] has said, "How [the] translation from subject-matter problem to statistical model is done is often the most critical part of an analysis".&lt;ref&gt;Cox (2006), p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Logical consequence|conclusion]] of a statistical inference is a statistical [[proposition]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Some common forms of statistical proposition are the following:
* a [[point estimate]], i.e. a particular value that best approximates some parameter of interest; 
* an [[interval estimate]], e.g. a [[confidence interval]] (or set estimate), i.e. an interval constructed using a dataset drawn from a population so that, under repeated sampling of such datasets, such intervals would contain the true parameter value with the [[frequency probability|probability]] at the stated [[confidence level]];
* a [[credible intervals|credible interval]], i.e. a set of values containing, for example, 95% of posterior belief;
* rejection of a [[statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis]];{{efn|According to Peirce, acceptance means that inquiry on this question ceases for the time being. In science, all scientific theories are revisable.}}
* [[Cluster analysis|clustering]] or [[Statistical classification|classification]] of data points into groups.

==Models and assumptions==
{{Main|Statistical model|Statistical assumptions}}
Any statistical inference requires some assumptions. A '''statistical model''' is a set of assumptions concerning the generation of the observed data and similar data. Descriptions of statistical models usually emphasize the role of population quantities of interest, about which we wish to draw inference.&lt;ref name=Cox2006&gt;Cox (2006) page 2&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptive statistics are typically used as a preliminary step before more formal inferences are drawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Evans|first=Michael|title=Probability and Statistics: The Science of Uncertainty|year=2004|publisher=Freeman and Company|page=267|display-authors=etal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hkWK8kFzXWIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22descriptive%20statistics%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9780716747420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degree of models/assumptions===
Statisticians distinguish between three levels of modeling assumptions;
* '''[[Parametric model|Fully parametric]]''': The probability distributions describing the data-generation process are assumed to be fully described by a family of probability distributions involving only a finite number of unknown parameters.&lt;ref name=Cox2006/&gt; For example, one may assume that the distribution of population values is truly Normal, with unknown mean and variance, and that datasets are generated by [[Simple random sample|'simple' random sampling]]. The family of [[Generalized linear model#Model components|generalized linear models]] is a widely used and flexible class of parametric models.
* '''[[Nonparametric statistics#Non-parametric models|Non-parametric]]''': The assumptions made about the process generating the data are much less than in parametric statistics and may be minimal.&lt;ref&gt;van der Vaart, A.W. (1998) ''Asymptotic Statistics''  Cambridge University Press. {{isbn|0-521-78450-6}} (page 341)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, every continuous probability distribution has a median, which may be estimated using the sample median or the [[Hodges–Lehmann estimator|Hodges–Lehmann–Sen estimator]], which has good properties when the data arise from simple random sampling.
* '''[[Semiparametric model|Semi-parametric]]''': This term typically implies assumptions 'in between' fully and non-parametric approaches. For example, one may assume that a population distribution has a finite mean. Furthermore, one may assume that the mean response level in the population depends in a truly linear manner on some covariate (a parametric assumption) but not make any parametric assumption describing the variance around that mean (i.e. about the presence or possible form of any [[heteroscedasticity]]). More generally, semi-parametric models can often be separated into 'structural' and 'random variation' components. One component is treated parametrically and the other non-parametrically. The well-known [[Cox model]] is a set of semi-parametric assumptions.

===Importance of valid models/assumptions===
Whatever level of assumption is made, correctly calibrated inference in general requires these assumptions to be correct; i.e. that the data-generating mechanisms really have been correctly specified.

Incorrect assumptions of [[Simple random sample|'simple' random sampling]] can invalidate statistical inference.&lt;ref&gt;Kruskal 1988&lt;/ref&gt; More complex semi- and fully parametric assumptions are also cause for concern. For example, incorrectly assuming the Cox model can in some cases lead to faulty conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;
[[David A. Freedman|Freedman, D.A.]] (2008) "Survival analysis: An Epidemiological hazard?". ''The American Statistician'' (2008) 62: 110-119. (Reprinted as Chapter 11 (pages 169–192) of Freedman (2010)).&lt;/ref&gt; Incorrect assumptions of Normality in the population also invalidates some forms of regression-based inference.&lt;ref&gt;Berk, R. (2003) ''Regression Analysis: A Constructive Critique (Advanced Quantitative Techniques in the Social Sciences) (v. 11)'' Sage Publications. {{isbn|0-7619-2904-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of '''any''' parametric model is viewed skeptically by most experts in sampling human populations:  "most sampling statisticians, when they deal with confidence intervals at all, limit themselves to statements about [estimators] based on very large samples, where the central limit theorem ensures that these [estimators] will have distributions that are nearly normal."&lt;ref name=Brewer&gt;{{cite book|first=Ken |last=Brewer| title=Combined Survey Sampling Inference: Weighing of Basu's Elephants| publisher=Hodder Arnold|page=6|year= 2002|isbn=978-0340692295}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, a normal distribution "would be a totally unrealistic and catastrophically unwise assumption to make if we were dealing with any kind of economic population."&lt;ref name=Brewer/&gt; Here, the central limit theorem states that the distribution of the sample mean "for very large samples" is approximately normally distributed, if the distribution is not heavy tailed.

====Approximate distributions====
{{Main|Statistical distance|Asymptotic theory (statistics)|Approximation theory}}

Given the difficulty in specifying exact distributions of sample statistics, many methods have been developed for approximating these.

With finite samples, [[approximation theory|approximation results]] measure how close a limiting distribution approaches the statistic's [[sample distribution]]: For example, with 10,000 independent samples the [[normal distribution]] approximates (to two digits of accuracy) the distribution of the [[sample mean]] for many population distributions, by the [[Berry–Esseen theorem]].&lt;ref name=JHJ&gt;
Jörgen Hoffman-Jörgensen's ''Probability With a View Towards Statistics'', Volume I. Page 399 {{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Yet for many practical purposes, the normal approximation provides a good approximation to the sample-mean's distribution when there are 10 (or more) independent samples, according to simulation studies and statisticians' experience.&lt;ref name=JHJ/&gt; Following Kolmogorov's work in the 1950s, advanced statistics uses [[approximation theory]] and [[functional analysis]] to quantify the error of approximation. In this approach, the [[metric geometry]] of [[probability distribution]]s is studied; this approach quantifies approximation error with, for example, the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]], [[Bregman divergence]], and the [[Hellinger distance]].&lt;ref&gt;Le Cam (1986) {{page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erik Torgerson (1991) ''Comparison of Statistical Experiments'', volume 36 of Encyclopedia of Mathematics. Cambridge University Press. {{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

With indefinitely large samples, [[asymptotic theory (statistics)|limiting results]] like the [[central limit theorem]] describe the sample statistic's limiting distribution, if one exists. Limiting results are not statements about finite samples, and indeed are irrelevant to finite samples.&lt;ref&gt;Kolmogorov (1963, p.369): "The frequency concept, &lt;!-- comma missing in original --&gt; based on the notion of limiting frequency as the number of trials increases to infinity, does not contribute anything to substantiate the applicability of the results of probability theory to real practical problems where we have always to deal with a finite number of trials".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Indeed, limit theorems 'as&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; tends to infinity' are logically devoid of content about what happens at any particular&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. All they can do is suggest certain approaches whose performance must then be checked on the case at hand." &amp;mdash; Le Cam (1986) (page xiv)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pfanzagl (1994): "The crucial drawback of asymptotic theory: What we expect from asymptotic theory are results which hold approximately . . . . What asymptotic theory has to offer are limit theorems."(page ix) "What counts for applications are approximations, not limits." (page 188)
&lt;/ref&gt; However, the asymptotic theory of limiting distributions is often invoked for work with finite samples. For example, limiting results are often invoked to justify the [[generalized method of moments]] and the use of [[generalized estimating equation]]s, which are popular in [[econometrics]] and [[biostatistics]]. The magnitude of the difference between the limiting distribution and the true distribution (formally, the 'error' of the approximation) can be assessed using simulation&lt;!-- and approximation results --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Pfanzagl (1994) : "By taking a limit theorem as being approximately true for large sample sizes, we commit an error the size of which is unknown. [. . .] Realistic information about the remaining errors may be obtained by simulations." (page ix)
&lt;/ref&gt; The heuristic application of limiting results to finite samples is common practice in many applications, especially with low-dimensional [[statistical model|models]] with [[logarithmically concave function|log-concave]] [[likelihood function|likelihood]]s (such as with one-parameter [[exponential families]]).

===Randomization-based models===
{{Main|Randomization}}
{{See also|Random sample|Random assignment}}

For a given dataset that was produced by a randomization design, the randomization distribution of a statistic (under the null-hypothesis) is defined by evaluating the test statistic for all of the plans that could have been generated by the randomization design. In frequentist inference, randomization allows inferences to be based on the randomization distribution rather than a subjective model, and this is important especially in survey sampling and design of experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerzy Neyman|Neyman, J.]](1934) "On the two different aspects of the representative method: The method of stratified sampling and the method of purposive selection", ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]'', 97 (4), 557&amp;ndash;625 {{jstor|2342192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinkelmann and Kempthorne"&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne(2008) {{page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical inference from randomized studies is also more straightforward than many other situations.&lt;ref&gt;ASA Guidelines for a first course in statistics for non-statisticians. (available at the ASA website)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David A. Freedman]] et alia's ''Statistics''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore et al. (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Bayesian inference]], randomization is also of importance: in [[survey sampling]], use of [[sampling without replacement]] ensures the [[exchangeability]] of the sample with the population; in randomized experiments, randomization warrants a [[missing at random]] assumption for [[covariate]] information.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Gelman|Gelman A.]] et al. (2013). ''Bayesian Data Analysis'' ([[Chapman &amp; Hall]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Objective randomization allows properly inductive procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1877-1878)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1883)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[[David A. Freedman|David Freedman]] et alia ''Statistics'' and [[David A. Freedman]] ''Statistical Models''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[[C. R. Rao|Rao, C.R.]] (1997) ''Statistics and Truth: Putting Chance to Work'', World Scientific. {{isbn|981-02-3111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many statisticians prefer randomization-based analysis of data that was generated by well-defined randomization procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce; Freedman; Moore et al. (2015).{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (However, it is true that in fields of science with developed theoretical knowledge and experimental control, randomized experiments may increase the costs of experimentation without improving the quality of inferences.&lt;ref&gt;Box, G.E.P. and Friends (2006) ''Improving Almost Anything: Ideas and Essays, Revised Edition'', Wiley. {{isbn|978-0-471-72755-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Cox (2006), page 196&lt;/ref&gt;)
Similarly, results from [[randomized experiment]]s are recommended by leading statistical authorities as allowing inferences with greater reliability than do observational studies of the same phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;ASA Guidelines for a first course in statistics for non-statisticians. (available at the ASA website)
* David A. Freedman et alia's ''Statistics''.
* Moore et al. (2015).
&lt;/ref&gt;
However, a good observational study may be better than a bad randomized experiment.

The statistical analysis of a randomized experiment may be based on the randomization scheme stated in the experimental protocol and does not need a subjective model.&lt;ref&gt;Neyman, Jerzy. 1923 [1990]. "On the Application of Probability Theory to AgriculturalExperiments. Essay on Principles. Section 9." ''Statistical Science'' 5 (4): 465–472. Trans. [[Dorota Dabrowska|Dorota M. Dabrowska]] and Terence P. Speed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann &amp; Kempthorne (2008) {{page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at any time, some hypotheses cannot be tested using objective statistical models, which accurately describe randomized experiments or random samples. In some cases, such randomized studies are uneconomical or unethical.

====Model-based analysis of randomized experiments====
It is standard practice to refer to a statistical model, often a linear model, when analyzing data from randomized experiments. However, the randomization scheme guides the choice of a statistical model. It is not possible to choose an appropriate model without knowing the randomization scheme.&lt;ref name="Hinkelmann and Kempthorne"/&gt; Seriously misleading results can be obtained analyzing data from randomized experiments while ignoring the experimental protocol; common mistakes include forgetting the blocking used in an experiment and confusing repeated measurements on the same experimental unit with independent replicates of the treatment applied to different experimental units.&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008) Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paradigms for inference==

Different schools of statistical inference have become established. These schools&amp;mdash;or "paradigms"&amp;mdash;are not mutually exclusive, and methods that work well under one paradigm often have attractive interpretations under other paradigms.

Bandyopadhyay &amp; Forster&lt;ref&gt;Bandyopadhyay &amp; Forster (2011). The quote is taken from the book's Introduction (p.3).  See also "Section&amp;nbsp;III: Four Paradigms of Statistics".&lt;/ref&gt;  describe four paradigms: "(i) classical statistics or error statistics, (ii) Bayesian statistics, (iii) likelihood-based statistics, and (iv) the Akaikean-Information Criterion-based statistics".  The classical (or [[Frequentist inference|frequentist]]) paradigm, the [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] paradigm, and the [[Akaike information criterion|AIC]]-based paradigm are summarized below.  The likelihood-based paradigm is essentially a sub-paradigm of the AIC-based paradigm.

===Frequentist inference===
{{See also|Frequentist inference}}

This paradigm calibrates the plausibility of propositions by considering (notional) repeated sampling of a population distribution to produce datasets similar to the one at hand. By considering the dataset's characteristics under repeated sampling, the frequentist properties of a statistical proposition can be quantified—although in practice this quantification may be challenging.

====Examples of frequentist inference====

* [[p-value|''p''-value]]
* [[Confidence interval]]

====Frequentist inference, objectivity, and decision theory====

One interpretation of [[frequentist inference]] (or classical inference) is that it is applicable only in terms of [[frequency probability]]; that is, in terms of repeated sampling from a population. However, the approach of Neyman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neyman | first1 = J. | authorlink = Jerzy Neyman | year = 1937 | title = Outline of a Theory of Statistical Estimation Based on the Classical Theory of Probability | jstor = 91337 | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A | volume = 236 | issue = 767| pages = 333–380 | doi=10.1098/rsta.1937.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt; develops these procedures in terms of pre-experiment probabilities. That is, before undertaking an experiment, one decides on a rule for coming to a conclusion such that the probability of being correct is controlled in a suitable way: such a probability need not have a frequentist or repeated sampling interpretation. In contrast, Bayesian inference works in terms of conditional probabilities (i.e. probabilities conditional on the observed data), compared to the marginal (but conditioned on unknown parameters) probabilities used in the frequentist approach.

The frequentist procedures of significance testing and confidence intervals can be constructed without regard to [[utility function]]s. However, some elements of frequentist statistics, such as [[statistical decision theory]], do incorporate [[utility function]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In particular, frequentist developments of optimal inference (such as [[minimum-variance unbiased estimator]]s, or [[uniformly most powerful test]]ing) make use of [[loss function]]s, which play the role of (negative) utility functions. Loss functions need not be explicitly stated for statistical theorists to prove that a statistical procedure has an optimality property.&lt;ref&gt;Preface to Pfanzagl.&lt;/ref&gt; However, loss-functions are often useful for stating optimality properties: for example, median-unbiased estimators are optimal under [[absolute value]] loss functions, in that they minimize expected loss, and [[least squares]] estimators are optimal under squared error loss functions, in that they minimize expected loss.

While statisticians using frequentist inference must choose for themselves the parameters of interest, and the [[estimators]]/[[Test statistic#Common test statistics|test statistic]] to be used, the absence of obviously explicit utilities and prior distributions has helped frequentist procedures to become widely viewed as 'objective'.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Bayesian inference===
{{See also|Bayesian Inference}}

The Bayesian calculus describes degrees of belief using the 'language' of probability; beliefs are positive, integrate to one, and obey probability axioms. Bayesian inference uses the available posterior beliefs as the basis for making statistical propositions. There are [[Bayesian probability#Justification of Bayesian probabilities|several different justifications]] for using the Bayesian approach.

====Examples of Bayesian inference====

* [[Credible interval]] for [[interval estimation]]
* [[Bayes factor]]s for model comparison

====Bayesian inference, subjectivity and decision theory====

Many informal Bayesian inferences are based on "intuitively reasonable" summaries of the posterior. For example, the posterior mean, median and mode, highest posterior density intervals, and Bayes Factors can all be motivated in this way. While a user's [[utility function]] need not be stated for this sort of inference, these summaries do all depend (to some extent) on stated prior beliefs, and are generally viewed as subjective conclusions. (Methods of prior construction which do not require external input have been [[Bayesian probability#Personal probabilities and objective methods for constructing priors|proposed]] but not yet fully developed.)

Formally, Bayesian inference is calibrated with reference to an explicitly stated utility, or loss function; the 'Bayes rule' is the one which maximizes expected utility, averaged over the posterior uncertainty. Formal Bayesian inference therefore automatically provides [[optimal decision]]s in a [[decision theory|decision theoretic]] sense. Given assumptions, data and utility, Bayesian inference can be made for essentially any problem, although not every statistical inference need have a Bayesian interpretation. Analyses which are not formally Bayesian can be (logically) [[Coherence (statistics)|incoherent]]; a feature of Bayesian procedures which use proper priors (i.e. those integrable to one) is that they are guaranteed to be [[Coherence (statistics)|coherent]]. Some advocates of [[Bayesian inference]] assert that inference ''must'' take place in this decision-theoretic framework, and that [[Bayesian inference]] should not conclude with the evaluation and summarization of posterior beliefs.

===AIC-based inference===
{{Main|Akaike information criterion}}
{{expand section|date=November 2017}}
The ''[[Akaike information criterion]]'' (AIC) is an [[estimator]] of the relative quality of [[statistical model]]s for a given set of data. Given a collection of models for the data, AIC estimates the quality of each model, relative to each of the other models. Thus, AIC provides a means for [[model selection]].

AIC is founded on [[information theory]]: it offers an estimate of the relative information lost when a given model is used to represent the process that generated the data. (In doing so, it deals with the trade-off between the [[goodness of fit]] of the model and the simplicity of the model.)

The minimum description length (MDL) principle has been developed from ideas in [[information theory]]&lt;ref name="Soofi 2000 1349–1353"&gt;Soofi (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and the theory of [[Kolmogorov complexity]].&lt;ref name=HY&gt;Hansen &amp; Yu (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  The (MDL) principle selects statistical models that maximally compress the data; inference proceeds without assuming counterfactual or non-falsifiable "data-generating mechanisms" or [[probability models]] for the data, as might be done in frequentist or Bayesian approaches.

However, if a "data generating mechanism" does exist in reality, then according to [[Claude Shannon|Shannon]]'s [[source coding theorem]] it provides the MDL description of the data, on average and asymptotically.&lt;ref name=HY747&gt;Hansen and Yu (2001), page 747.&lt;/ref&gt; In minimizing description length (or descriptive complexity), MDL estimation is similar to [[maximum likelihood estimation]] and [[maximum a posteriori estimation]] (using [[Maximum entropy probability distribution|maximum-entropy]] [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian priors]]). However, MDL avoids assuming that the underlying probability model is known; the MDL principle can also be applied without assumptions that e.g. the data arose from independent sampling.&lt;ref name=HY747/&gt;&lt;ref name=JR&gt;Rissanen (1989), page 84&lt;/ref&gt;

The MDL principle has been applied in communication-[[coding theory]] in [[information theory]], in [[linear regression]],&lt;ref name=JR/&gt; and in [[data mining]].&lt;ref name=HY/&gt;

The evaluation of MDL-based inferential procedures often uses techniques or criteria from [[computational complexity theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph F. Traub, G. W. Wasilkowski, and H. Wozniakowski. (1988) {{page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fiducial inference====
{{Main|Fiducial inference}}
[[Fiducial inference]] was an approach to statistical inference based on [[fiducial probability]], also known as a "fiducial distribution". In subsequent work, this approach has been called ill-defined, extremely limited in applicability,  and even fallacious.&lt;ref&gt;Neyman (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zabell (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; However this argument is the same as that which shows&lt;ref&gt;Cox (2006) page 66&lt;/ref&gt;  that a so-called [[confidence distribution]] is not a valid [[probability distribution]] and, since this has not invalidated the application of [[confidence interval]]s, it does not necessarily invalidate conclusions drawn from fiducial arguments. An attempt was made to reinterpret the early work of Fisher's [[Fiducial probability|fiducial argument]] as a special case of an inference theory using [[Upper and lower probabilities]].{{sfn|Hampel|2003}}

====Structural inference====

Developing ideas of Fisher and of Pitman from 1938 to 1939,&lt;ref&gt;Davison, page 12. {{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George A. Barnard]] developed "structural inference" or "pivotal inference",&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, G.A. (1995) "Pivotal Models and the Fiducial Argument", International Statistical Review, 63 (3), 309–323. {{jstor|1403482}}&lt;/ref&gt; an approach using [[Haar measure|invariant probabilities]] on [[group family|group families]]. Barnard reformulated the arguments behind fiducial inference on a restricted class of models on which "fiducial" procedures would be well-defined and useful.

'''Systematic reviews''' are a type of [[literature review]] that uses systematic methods to collect secondary data, critically appraise research studies, and synthesize studies. Systematic reviews formulate research questions that are broad or narrow in scope, and identify and synthesize studies that directly relate to the systematic review question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=systematic review|url=http://getitglossary.org/term/systematic+review|website=GET-IT glossary|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are designed to provide a complete, exhaustive summary of current evidence relevant to a [[research question]]. Systematic reviews of [[randomized controlled trial]]s are key to the practice of [[evidence-based medicine]],&lt;ref name='CEBM_about'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cebm.net/index.aspx?o=1914|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406110628/http://www.cebm.net/index.aspx?o=1914|archivedate=2011-04-06 |title=What is EBM? |accessdate=2011-06-17 |date=2009-11-20 |publisher=[[Centre for Evidence Based Medicine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a review of existing studies is often quicker and cheaper than embarking on a new study.

An understanding of systematic reviews, and how to implement them in practice, is highly recommended for professionals involved in the delivery of [[health care]]. Besides health interventions, systematic reviews may examine clinical tests, public health interventions, environmental interventions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.envsci.2014.05.010 |title=On the use of systematic reviews to inform environmental policies |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Policy |volume=42 |pages=67–77 |year=2014 |last1=Bilotta |first1=Gary S. |last2=Milner |first2=Alice M. |last3=Boyd |first3=Ian }}&lt;/ref&gt; social interventions, [[adverse effects]], and [[economic evaluation]]s.&lt;ref name=CRD2008&gt;[https://www.york.ac.uk/media/crd/Systematic_Reviews.pdf Systematic reviews: CRD's guidance for undertaking reviews in health care.] York: [[University of York]], Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-900640-47-3}}.

Wiley Blackwell, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic reviews are not limited to [[medicine]] and are quite common in all other sciences where data are collected, published in the literature, and an assessment of methodological quality for a precisely defined subject would be helpful.&lt;ref name="Herman2008"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Methodological quality |title=Advising on Research Methods: A consultant's companion |publisher=Johannes van Kessel Publishing |year=2008 |isbn=978-90-79418-02-2 |author1 = Herman J.

==Characteristics==
A systematic review aims to provide a complete, exhaustive summary of current literature relevant to a [[research question]]. The first step in conducting a systematic review is to create a structured question to guide the review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Standards for Systematic Reviews of Comparative Effectiveness|first1=Research|last2=Eden|first2=J|last3=Levit|first3=L|last4=Berg|first4=A|last5=Morton|first5=S|title=Finding What Works in Health Care: Standards for Systematic Reviews.|date=2011|pmid=24983062|doi=10.17226/13059}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second step is to perform a thorough search of the literature for relevant papers. The ''Methodology'' section of a systematic review will list all of the [[database]]s and [[citation index]]es that were searched such as [[Web of Science]], [[Embase]], and [[PubMed]] and any individual journals that were searched. The titles and abstracts of identified articles are checked against pre-determined criteria for eligibility and relevance to form an inclusion set. This set will relate back to the research problem. Each included study may be assigned an objective assessment of methodological quality preferably by using methods conforming to the [[Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses]] (PRISMA) statement (the current guideline)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prisma-statement.org/ |title=PRISMA |publisher=Prisma-statement.org |accessdate=2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the high quality standards of Cochrane.&lt;ref name=CochraneHandbook&gt;{{cite web|url=http://handbook.cochrane.org |editor1=Higgins JPT |editor2= Green S |title=Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions, version 5.1.0 (updated March 2011) |publisher=The Cochrane Collaboration |accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic reviews often, but not always, use statistical techniques ([[meta-analysis]]) to combine results of eligible studies, or at least use scoring of the levels of evidence depending on the methodology used. An additional rater may be consulted to resolve any scoring differences between raters.&lt;ref name="Herman2008"/&gt; Systematic review is often applied in the [[biomedical research|biomedical]] or healthcare context, but it can be applied in any field of research. Groups like the [[Campbell Collaboration]] are promoting the use of systematic reviews in policy-making beyond just healthcare.

A systematic review uses an objective and transparent approach for research synthesis, with the aim of minimizing bias. While many systematic reviews are based on an explicit [[quantitative research|quantitative]] meta-analysis of available data, there are also [[qualitative research|qualitative]] reviews which adhere to standards for gathering, analyzing and reporting evidence.&lt;ref name=Bearman2013&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/medu.12092 |pmid=23398011 |title=Qualitative synthesis and systematic review in health professions education |journal=Medical Education |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=252–60 |year=2013 |last1=Bearman |first1=Margaret |last2=Dawson |first2=Phillip }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[EPPI-Centre]] has been influential in developing methods for combining both qualitative and quantitative research in systematic reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7446.1010 |pmid=15105329 |pmc=404509 |title=Integrating qualitative research with trials in systematic reviews |journal=BMJ |volume=328 |issue=7446 |pages=1010–2 |year=2004 |last1=Thomas |first1=J. |last2=Harden |first2=A |last3=Oakley |first3=A |last4=Oliver |first4=S |last5=Sutcliffe |first5=K |last6=Rees |first6=R |last7=Brunton |first7=G |last8=Kavanagh |first8=J }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PRISMA statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000100 |pmid=19621070 |pmc=2707010 |title=The PRISMA Statement for Reporting Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses of Studies That Evaluate Health Care Interventions: Explanation and Elaboration |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=e1000100 |year=2009 |last1=Liberati |first1=Alessandro |last2=Altman |first2=Douglas G. |last3=Tetzlaff |first3=Jennifer |last4=Mulrow |first4=Cynthia |last5=Gøtzsche |first5=Peter C. |last6=Ioannidis |first6=John P.

Developments in systematic reviews during the 21st century included [[Philosophical realism|realist]] reviews and the [[meta-narrative]] approach, both of which addressed problems of methods and [[heterogeneity]] existing on some subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1258/1355819054308530 |pmid=16053581 |title=Realist review - a new method of systematic review designed for complex policy interventions |journal=Journal of Health Services Research &amp; Policy |volume=10 |pages=21–34 |year=2005 |last1=Pawson |first1=R. |last2=Greenhalgh |first2=T. |last3=Harvey |first3=G. |last4=Walshe |first4=K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2009.00578.x |pmid=20021585 |pmc=2888022 |jstor=25593645 |title=Tensions and Paradoxes in Electronic Patient Record Research: A Systematic Literature Review Using the Meta-narrative Method |journal=Milbank Quarterly |volume=87 |issue=4 |pages=729–88 |year=2009 |last1=Greenhalgh |first1=Trisha |last2=Potts |first2=Henry W.W. |last3=Wong |first3=Geoff |last4=Bark |first4=Pippa |last5=Swinglehurst |first5=Deborah }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main stages of a systematic review are:

Once these stages are complete, the review may be published, disseminated and translated into practice after being adopted as evidence.

==Research fields==
===Medicine and biology===
The [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane]] is a group of over 37,000 specialists in healthcare who systematically review randomised trials of the effects of prevention, treatments and rehabilitation as well as health systems interventions. When appropriate, they also include the results of other types of research. Cochrane Reviews are published in ''The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews'' section of the [[Cochrane Library]]. The 2015 [[impact factor]] for ''The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews'' was 6.103, and it was ranked 12th in the “Medicine, General &amp; Internal” category.&lt;ref&gt;The Cochrane Library. [http://www.cochrane.org/news/2015-impact-factor-released-cochrane-database-systematic-reviews 2015 impact factor. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR)] Retrieved 2016-07-20.&lt;/ref&gt; There are six types of Cochrane Review:&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.cochrane.org/revman Review Manager (RevMan) [Computer program&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;].

# '''Intervention reviews''' assess the benefits and harms of interventions used in healthcare and health policy.
# '''Diagnostic test accuracy reviews''' assess how well a diagnostic test performs in diagnosing and detecting a particular disease.
# '''Methodology reviews''' address issues relevant to how systematic reviews and clinical trials are conducted and reported.
# '''Qualitative reviews''' synthesize qualitative and quantitative evidence to address questions on aspects other than effectiveness.&lt;ref name=Bearman2013 /&gt;
# '''Prognosis reviews''' address the probable course or future outcome(s) of people with a health problem.
# '''Overviews of Systematic Reviews (OoRs)''' are a new type of study in order to compile multiple evidence from systematic reviews into a single document that is accessible and useful to serve as a friendly front end for the Cochrane Collaboration with regard to healthcare decision-making.

The Cochrane Collaboration provides a handbook for systematic reviewers of interventions which "provides guidance to authors for the preparation of Cochrane Intervention reviews."&lt;ref name=CochraneHandbook/&gt; The ''Cochrane Handbook'' outlines eight general steps for preparing a systematic review:&lt;ref name=CochraneHandbook/&gt;
# Defining the review question(s) and developing criteria for including studies
# Searching for studies
# Selecting studies and collecting data
# Assessing risk of bias in included studies
# Analysing data and undertaking meta-analyses
# Addressing [[Reporting bias|reporting biases]]
# Presenting results and "summary of findings" tables
# Interpreting results and drawing conclusions

The Cochrane Handbook forms the basis of two sets of standards for the conduct and reporting of Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR - Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.editorial-unit.cochrane.org/mecir|title=Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR)|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cochrane Collaboration logo visually represents how results from some systematic reviews can be explained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cccrg.cochrane.org/animated-storyboard-what-are-systematic-reviews|title=Animated Storyboard: What Are Systematic Reviews? {{!}} Cochrane Consumers and Communication|last=anonymous|website=cccrg.cochrane.org|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lines within illustrate the summary results from an iconic systematic review showing the benefit of corticosteroids, which 'has probably saved thousands of premature babies'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cochrane.org/about-us/our-logo|title=Our logo {{!}} Cochrane|website=www.cochrane.org|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social sciences ===

The quasi-standard for systematic review in the social sciences is based on the procedures proposed by the [[Campbell Collaboration]], which is one of a number of groups promoting [[evidence-based policy]] in the [[social science]]s. The Campbell Collaboration "helps people make well-informed decisions by preparing, maintaining and disseminating systematic reviews in education, crime and justice, social welfare and international development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/about_us/index.php|title = About Us|publisher = The Campbell Collaboration|accessdate = March 26, 2014|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140203232624/http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/about_us/index.php|archivedate = February 3, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a sister initiative of Cochrane. The Campbell Collaboration was created in 2000 and the inaugural meeting in Philadelphia, USA, attracted 85 participants from 13 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/history/explore/background|title=History - Campbell|website=www.campbellcollaboration.org|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business and economics ===

Due to the different nature of research fields outside of the natural sciences, the aforementioned methodological steps cannot easily be applied in business research. Early attempts to transfer the procedures from medicine to business research have been made by Tranfield et al. (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tranfield D., Denyer D., Smart P. | year = 2003 | title = Towards a methodology for developing evidence-informed management knowledge by means of systematic review | url = | journal = British Journal of Management | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 207–222 | doi=10.1111/1467-8551.00375}}&lt;/ref&gt; A step-by-step approach has been developed by Durach et al.: Based on the experiences they have made in their own discipline, these authors have adapted the methodological steps and developed a standard procedure for conducting systematic literature reviews in business and economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Durach C.F., Kembro J., Wieland A. | year = 2017 | title = A New Paradigm for Systematic Literature Reviews in Supply Chain Management | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/jscm.12145 | journal = Journal of Supply Chain Management | volume = 53 | issue = 4| pages = 67–85 | doi=10.1111/jscm.12145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strengths and weaknesses==
While systematic reviews are regarded as the strongest form of medical evidence, a review of 300 studies found that not all systematic reviews were equally reliable, and that their reporting can be improved by a universally agreed upon set of standards and guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040078 |pmid=17388659 |pmc=1831728 |title=Epidemiology and Reporting Characteristics of Systematic Reviews |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=e78 |year=2007 |last1=Moher |first1=David |last2=Tetzlaff |first2=Jennifer |last3=Tricco |first3=Andrea C |last4=Sampson |first4=Margaret |last5=Altman |first5=Douglas G }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further study by the same group found that of 100 systematic reviews monitored, 7% needed updating at the time of publication, another 4% within a year, and another 11% within 2 years; this figure was higher in rapidly changing fields of medicine, especially cardiovascular medicine.&lt;ref name="pmid17638714"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-147-4-200708210-00179 |pmid=17638714 |title=How Quickly Do Systematic Reviews Go Out of Date? A Survival Analysis |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=147 |issue=4 |pages=224–33 |year=2007 |last1=Shojania |first1=Kaveh G. |last2=Sampson |first2=M |last3=Ansari |first3=M. T. |last4=Ji |first4=J |last5=Doucette |first5=S |last6=Moher |first6=D }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 study suggested that extending searches beyond major databases, perhaps into [[grey literature]], would increase the effectiveness of reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0266462303000163 |pmid=12701949 |title=Beyond Medline |journal=International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=168–78 |year=2003 |last1=Savoie |first1=Isabelle |last2=Helmer |first2=Diane |last3=Green |first3=Carolyn J. |last4=Kazanjian |first4=Arminée }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts and colleagues highlighted the problems with systematic reviews, particularly those conducted by the [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]], noting that published reviews are often biased, out of date and excessively long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.h2463 |pmid=26041754 |title=The knowledge system underpinning healthcare is not fit for purpose and must change |journal=BMJ |volume=350 |pages=h2463 |year=2015 |last1=Roberts |first1=I. |last2=Ker |first2=K. |last3=Edwards |first3=P. |last4=Beecher |first4=D. |last5=Manno |first5=D. |last6=Sydenham |first6=E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; They criticized Cochrane reviews as not being sufficiently critical in the selection of trials and including too many of low quality. They proposed several solutions, including limiting studies in meta-analyses and reviews to registered clinical trials, requiring that original data be made available for statistical checking, paying greater attention to sample size estimates, and eliminating dependence on only published data.

Some of these difficulties were noted early on as described by Altman: "much poor research arises because researchers feel compelled for career reasons to carry out research that they are ill equipped to perform, and nobody stops them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.308.6924.283 |pmid=8124111 |pmc=2539276 |title=The scandal of poor medical research |journal=BMJ |volume=308 |issue=6924 |pages=283–4 |year=1994 |last1=Altman |first1=D G }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodological limitations of meta-analysis have also been noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7977286 |url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7977286 |year=1994 |author1=Shapiro |first1=S |title=Meta-analysis/Shmeta-analysis |journal=American Journal of Epidemiology |volume=140 |issue=9 |pages=771–8 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a117324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern is that the methods used to conduct a systematic review are sometimes changed once researchers see the available trials they are going to include.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.MR000035.pub2 |pmid=25271098 |title=Bias due to selective inclusion and reporting of outcomes and analyses in systematic reviews of randomised trials of healthcare interventions |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=10 |pages=MR000035 |year=2014 |last1=Page |first1=Matthew J |last2=McKenzie |first2=Joanne E |last3=Kirkham |first3=Jamie |last4=Dwan |first4=Kerry |last5=Kramer |first5=Sharon |last6=Green |first6=Sally |last7=Forbes |first7=Andrew }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloggers have described retractions of systematic reviews and published reports of studies included in published systematic reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retraction Of Scientific Papers For Fraud Or Bias Is Just The Tip Of The Iceberg|url=http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/retraction-scientific-papers-fraud-or-bias-just-tip-iceberg|website=IFL Science!|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retraction and republication for Lancet Resp Med tracheostomy paper|url=http://retractionwatch.com/2015/04/02/retraction-and-republication-for-lancet-resp-med-tracheostomy-paper/|website=Retraction Watch|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BioMed Central retracting 43 papers for fake peer review|url=http://retractionwatch.com/2015/03/26/biomed-central-retracting-43-papers-for-fake-peer-review/|website=Retraction Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic reviews are increasingly prevalent in other fields, such as international development research.&lt;ref name=Hagen-Zanker2012&gt;{{cite web |first1=Jessica |last1=Hagen-Zanker |first2=Maren |last2=Duvendack |first3=Richard |last3=Mallett |first4=Rachel |last4=Slater |first5=Samuel |last5=Carpenter |first6=Mathieu |last6=Tromme |date=January 2012 |title=Making systematic reviews work for international development research |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=6260&amp;title=systematic-review-slrc-international-development-research-methods |publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a number of donors – most notably the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and [[AusAid]] – are focusing more attention and resources on testing the appropriateness of systematic reviews in assessing the impacts of development and humanitarian interventions.&lt;ref name=Hagen-Zanker2012/&gt;

'''''Tarasoff v. [[Regents of the University of California]]''''', 17 Cal. 3d 425, 551 [[P.2d]] 334, 131 Cal. Rptr. 14 ([[Supreme Court of California|Cal.]] 1976), was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of California]] held that [[mental health professional]]s have a [[duty to protect]] individuals who are being threatened with bodily harm by a patient.  The original 1974 decision mandated warning the threatened individual, but a 1976 rehearing of the case by the California Supreme Court called for a "duty to protect" the intended victim.  The professional may discharge the duty in several ways, including notifying police, [[duty to warn|warning the intended victim]], and/or taking other reasonable steps to protect the threatened individual.

==History==
Prosenjit Poddar was a student from [[Bengal]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=People v. Poddar |vol=518 |reporter=P.2d |opinion=342 |pinpoint= |court=Supreme Court of California |date=February 7, 1974 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10716111142563485073 |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the [[University of California, Berkeley]] as a graduate student in September 1967 and resided at International House. In the fall of 1968, he attended folk dancing classes at the International House, and it was there that he met Tatiana Tarasoff. They dated, but apparently had different ideas about the relationship. He assumed  their relationship was serious. This view was not shared by Tarasoff who, upon learning of his feelings, told him that she was involved with other men and that she was not interested in entering into an intimate relationship with him.  This gave rise to feelings of resentment in Poddar. He began to stalk her.

After this rebuff, Poddar underwent a severe emotional crisis. He became depressed and neglected his appearance, his studies, and his health. He kept to himself, speaking disjointedly and often weeping. This condition persisted, with steady deterioration, throughout the spring and into the summer of 1969. Poddar had occasional meetings with Tarasoff during this period and tape-recorded their various conversations to try to find out why she did not love him.

During the summer of 1969, Tarasoff went to [[South America]]. After her departure, Poddar began to improve and at the suggestion of a friend sought psychological assistance. Prosenjit Poddar was a patient of Dr. Lawrence Moore, a [[psychologist]] at UC Berkeley's Cowell Memorial Hospital in 1969. Poddar confided his intent to kill Tarasoff. Dr. Moore requested that the campus police detain Poddar, writing that, in his opinion, Poddar was suffering from [[paranoid schizophrenia]], acute and severe. The psychologist recommended that the defendant be [[civil commitment|civilly committed]] as a dangerous person. Poddar was detained but shortly thereafter released, as he appeared rational. Dr. Moore's supervisor, Dr. Harvey Powelson, then ordered that Poddar not be subject to further detention.
 
In October, after Tarasoff had returned, Poddar stopped seeing his psychologist. Neither Tarasoff nor her parents received any warning of the threat. Poddar then befriended Tarasoff's brother, even moving in with him. Several weeks later, on October 27, 1969, Poddar carried out the plan he had confided to his psychologist, stabbing and killing Tarasoff. Tarasoff's parents then sued Moore and various other employees of the university.

Poddar was subsequently convicted of [[second-degree murder]], but the conviction was later appealed and overturned on the grounds that the jury was inadequately [[jury instructions|instructed]]. A second trial was not held, and Poddar was released on the condition that he would return to [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Munson |editor-first=Ronald |date=2008 |title=Intervention and Reflection: Basic Issues in Medical Ethics |edition=8th |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |location=Belmont, CA |oclc=156891897 |isbn=978-0-495-09502-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

==Opinion of the court==
The California Supreme Court found that a [[mental health professional]] has a duty not only to a patient, but also to individuals who are specifically being threatened by a patient. This decision has since been adopted by most states in the U.S. and is widely influential in jurisdictions outside the U.S. as well.

Justice [[Mathew Tobriner|Mathew O. Tobriner]] wrote the [[holding (law)|holding]] in the majority opinion. "We conclude that the [[public policy]] favoring protection of the [[Medical confidentiality|confidential]] character of patient-psychotherapist communications must yield to the extent to which disclosure is essential to avert danger to others. The protective privilege ends where the public peril begins."&lt;ref name=OpinionTarsoff1976&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Tarasoff v. Regents of University of California |vol=17 |reporter=Cal.3d |opinion=425 |court=Supreme Court of California |date=July 1, 1976 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=263231934673470561 |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=263231934673470561#p442 442]}}

Justice Mosk wrote a partial dissent,&lt;ref name=OpinionTarsoff1976/&gt;{{rp|page=[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=263231934673470561#p451 451]}} arguing that (1) the rule in future cases should be one of the actual subjective prediction of violence on the part of the psychiatrist, which occurred in this case, not one based on objective professional standards, because predictions are inherently unreliable; and (2) the psychiatrists notified the police, who were presumably in a better position to protect Tarasoff than she would be to protect herself.

Justice Clark dissented, quoting a [[law review]] article that stated, "…the very practice of psychiatry depends upon the reputation in the community that the psychiatrist will not tell."&lt;ref name=OpinionTarsoff1976/&gt;{{rp|page=[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=263231934673470561#p458 458]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Slovenko |first=Ralph |title=Psychiatry and a Second Look at the Medical Privilege |volume=6 |journal=Wayne Law Review |page=175 |date=Spring 1960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=188}}

==Subsequent developments==

As of 2012, a duty to warn or protect is mandated and codified in legislative statutes of 23 states, while the duty is not codified in a statute but is present in the common law supported by precedent in 10 states.&lt;ref name=Johnson_et_al-2014/&gt; 11 states have a permissive duty, and six states are described as having no statutes or case law offering guidance.&lt;ref name=Johnson_et_al-2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Rebecca |last2=Persad |first2=Govind |last3=Sisti |first3=Dominic |date=December 2014 |title=The ''Tarasoff'' Rule: The Implications of Interstate Variation and Gaps in Professional Training |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=469–477 |pmid=25492073 |url=http://www.jaapl.org/content/42/4/469.long }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite initial commentators predictions of negative consequences for psychotherapy because of the ''Tarasoff'' ruling, court decisions show otherwise. An analysis of 70 cases that went to appellate courts between 1985 and 2006 found that only four of the six rulings in favor of the plaintiff cited ''Tarasoff'' statutes; courts ruled in favor of the defendant in 46 cases and sent 17 cases back to lower courts.&lt;ref name=Johnson_et_al-2014/&gt;{{rp|475}} However, courts do rule in victims' favor in clear-cut cases of failure to warn or protect, such as the case of a psychiatrist who committed rape during a child psychiatry fellowship, for which he was recommended even after telling his own psychiatrist about his sexual attraction to children.&lt;ref name=Johnson_et_al-2014/&gt;{{rp|475}}

In 2018, the Court held that universities should protect students in the [[Regents of University of California v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/article206385859.html|title=Court: California colleges have duty to protect students|last=THANAWALA|first=SUDHIN|date=2018-03-22|work=The Sacramento Bee|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en-US|issn=0890-5738}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailybruin.com/2018/03/22/california-supreme-court-rules-alumna-can-sue-ucla-for-2009-stabbing/|title=California Supreme Court rules alumna can sue UCLA for 2009 stabbing|website=dailybruin.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Practically all industrial lead poisoning is due to the inhalation of dust and fumes; and if you stop their inhalation you will stop the poisoning.''
