'''Agricultural economics''' is an applied field of [[economics]] concerned with the application of economic theory in optimizing the production and distribution of food and fiber.  Agricultural economics began as a branch of economics that specifically dealt with [[land use|land usage]], it focused on maximizing the [[crop yield]] while maintaining a good [[soil science|soil ecosystem]].  Throughout the 20th century the discipline expanded and the current scope of the discipline is much broader.  [[Agricultural]] economics today includes a variety of applied areas, having considerable overlap with conventional economics.&lt;ref&gt;Karl A. Fox (1987).

Gardner (2001), "Agriculture, Economics of," ''[[International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences]]'', v. 1, pp. 337-344.

(2010)"&gt;Daniel A. Sumner, Julian M. Alson, and Joseph W. Glauber (2010). "Evolution of the Economics of Agricultural Policy", ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'', v. 92, pp. 403-423.&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural economists have made substantial contributions to research in economics, [[econometrics]], [[development economics]], and [[environmental economics]].  Agricultural economics influences [[food policy]], [[agricultural policy]], and [[environmental policy]].

Economics has been defined as the study of resource allocation under scarcity. Agricultural economics, or the application of economic methods to optimizing the decisions made by agricultural producers, grew to prominence around the turn of the 20th century.  The field of agricultural economics can be traced out to works on land economics.  [[Henry Charles Taylor]] was the greatest contributor with the establishment of the Department of Agricultural Economics at Wisconsin in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Story of The Department of Agricultural Economics: 1909-1972 | author = Shaars, Marvin A. | year=  1972 | url = http://www.aae.wisc.edu/pubs/AAEStory.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another contributor, 1979 Nobel Economics Prize winner [[Theodore Schultz]], was among the first to examine [[development economics]] as a problem related directly to agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schultz |first=Theodore |title=Economic Growth and Agriculture |location=New York |publisher=MacGraw-Hill |year=1968 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schultz was also instrumental in establishing [[econometrics]] as a tool for use in analyzing agricultural economics empirically; he noted in his landmark 1956 article that agricultural supply analysis is rooted in "shifting sand", implying that it was and is simply not being done correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Theodore W. |last=Schultz |year=1956 |title=Reflections on Agricultural Production, Output and Supply |journal=Journal of Farm Economics |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=748–762 |jstor=1234459 |doi=10.2307/1234459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One scholar summarizes the development of agricultural economics as follows:

"Agricultural economics arose in the late 19th century, combined the [[theory of the firm]] with marketing and organization theory, and developed throughout the 20th century largely as an empirical branch of general economics.  The discipline was closely linked to empirical applications of mathematical statistics and made early and significant contributions to econometric methods.  In the 1960s and afterwards, as agricultural sectors in the OECD countries contracted, agricultural economists were drawn to the development problems of poor countries, to the trade and macroeconomic policy implications of agriculture in rich countries, and to a variety of production, consumption, and environmental and resource problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ford |last=Runge|title=Agricultural Economics: A Brief Intellectual History|page=1 (abstract)|work= University of Minnesota Working Paper WP06-1|year= June 2006|url= http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/13649/1/wp06-01.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agricultural economists have made many well-known contributions to the economics field with such models as the [[cobweb model]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Mordecai Ezekiel]]|title=The Cobweb Theorem|journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics|date=February 1938|volume=52|issue=2|pages=255–280|url=http://www.econ-pol.unisi.it/paolopin/TeachMaterial/IntroMatlabStata/Ezekiel1938.pdf|doi=10.2307/1881734|access-date=2015-03-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616073821/http://www.econ-pol.unisi.it/paolopin/TeachMaterial/IntroMatlabStata/Ezekiel1938.pdf|archive-date=2015-06-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hedonic regression]] pricing models,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1230278 | last1 = Waugh | first1 = F. | year = 1928 | title = Quality Factors Influencing Vegetable Prices | jstor = 1230278| journal = Journal of Farm Economics | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 185–196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; new technology and diffusion models ([[Zvi Griliches]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1905380 | last1 = Griliches | first1 = Zvi | authorlink = Zvi Griliches | year = 1957 | title = Hybrid Corn: An Exploration in the Economics of Technical Change | jstor = 1905380| journal = Econometrica | volume = 25 | issue = 4| pages = 501–522 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[multifactor productivity]] and efficiency theory and measurement,&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, M.J., "The Measurement of Productive Efficiency," ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]'' Series A, General 125 Part 2(1957): 252-267.  Farrell's frequently cited application involved an empirical application of state level agricultural data&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Vernon Wesley Ruttan]], "Technological Progress in the Meatpacking Industry, 1919-47," USDA Marketing Research Report No. 59, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; and the random coefficients regression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2284029 | last1 = Hildreth | first1 = H. | last2 = Houck | first2 = J. | year = 1968 | title = Some Estimators for a Linear Model with Random Coefficients | jstor = 2284029| journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association | volume = 63 | issue = 322| pages = 584–595 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The farm sector is frequently cited as a prime example of the [[perfect competition]] economic paradigm.

In Asia, agricultural economics was offered first by the University of the Philippines Los Baños Department of Agricultural Economics in 1919. Today, the field of agricultural economics has transformed into a more integrative discipline which covers farm management and production economics, rural finance and institutions, agricultural marketing and prices, agricultural policy and development, food and nutrition economics, and environmental and natural resource economics.

Since the 1970s, agricultural economics has primarily focused on seven main topics, according to a scholar in the field: agricultural environment and resources; risk and uncertainty; food and consumer economics; prices and incomes; market structures; trade and development; and technical change and human capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ford |last=Runge|title=Agricultural Economics: A Brief Intellectual History|page=15-16|work= University of Minnesota Working Paper WP06-1|year= June 2006|url= http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/13649/1/wp06-01.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major topics in agricultural economics==

===Agricultural environment and natural resources===
In the field of environmental economics, agricultural economists have contributed in three main areas: designing incentives to control environmental externalities (such as water pollution due to agricultural production), estimating the value of non-market benefits from natural resources and environmental amenities (such as an appealing rural landscape), and the complex interrelationship between economic activities and environmental consequences.&lt;ref name="Kling et al. (2010)"&gt;Catherine L. Kling, Kathleen Segerson and Jason F. Shogren (2010). "Environmental Economics: How Agricultural Economists Helped Advance the Field" ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'', v. 92, pp. 487-505.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to natural resources, agricultural economists have developed quantitative tools for improving land management, preventing erosion, managing pests, protecting biodiversity, and preventing livestock diseases.&lt;ref name="Lichtenberg et al. (2010)"&gt;Erik Lichtenberg, James Shortle, James Wilen and David Zilberman (2010). "Natural Resource Economics and Conservation: Contributions of Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Economists" ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'', v. 92, pp. 469-486.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food and consumer economics===
While at one time, the field of agricultural economics was focused primarily on farm-level issues, in recent years agricultural economists have studied diverse topics related to the economics of food consumption. In addition to economists' long-standing emphasis on the effects of prices and incomes, researchers in this field have studied how information and quality attributes influence consumer behavior. Agricultural economists have contributed to understanding how households make choices between purchasing food or preparing it at home, how food prices are determined, definitions of poverty thresholds, how consumers respond to price and income changes in a consistent way, and survey and experimental tools for understanding consumer preferences.&lt;ref name="Unnevehr et al. (2010)"&gt;Laurian Unnevehr, James Eales, Helen Jensen, Jayson Lusk, Jill McCluskey and Jean Kinsey (2010). "Food and Consumer Economics" ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'', v. 92, pp. 506-521.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production economics and farm management===
Agricultural economics research has addressed diminishing returns in agricultural production, as well as farmers' costs and supply responses. Much research has applied economic theory to farm-level decisions. Studies of risk and decision-making under uncertainty have real-world applications to crop insurance policies and to understanding how farmers in developing countries make choices about technology adoption. These topics are important for understanding prospects for producing sufficient food for a growing world population, subject to new resource and environmental challenges such as [[water scarcity]] and global climate change.&lt;ref name="Chavas et al. (2010)"&gt;Jean-Paul Chavas, Robert G. Chambers and Rulon D. Pope (2010). "Production Economics and Farm Management" ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'', v. 92, pp. 356-375.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development economics===
Development economics is broadly concerned with the improvement of living conditions in low-income countries, and the improvement of economic performance in low-income settings. Because agriculture is a large part of most developing economies, both in terms of employment and share of GDP, agricultural economists have been at the forefront of empirical research on development economics, contributing to our understanding of agriculture's role in economic development, economic growth and structural transformation. Many agricultural economists are interested in the food systems of developing economies, the linkages between agriculture and nutrition, and the ways in which agriculture interact with other domains, such as the natural environment.&lt;ref name="Gollin et al. (2002)"&gt;Douglas Gollin, Stephen Parente and Richard Rogerson (2002). "The Role of Agriculture in Development" ''[[The American Economic Review]]'', v. 92, pp. 160-164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Timmer (2002)"&gt;C. Peter Timmer (2002). "Agriculture and economic development" ''[[Handbook of Agricultural Economics]]'', Vol 2, Part A, pp. 1487-1546.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional associations==

The International Association of Agricultural Economists (IAAE) is a worldwide professional association, which holds its major conference every three years. The association publishes the journal ''Agricultural Economics''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaae-agecon.org/journal/journal.html ''Agricultural Economics'']&lt;/ref&gt; There also is a European Association of Agricultural Economists (EAAE), an African Association of Agricultural Economists [AAAE]and an [[Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society]]. Substantial work in agricultural economics internationally is conducted by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]].

In the United States, the primary professional association is the [[Agricultural &amp; Applied Economics Association]] (AAEA), which holds its own annual conference and also co-sponsors the annual meetings of the Allied Social Sciences Association (ASSA). The AAEA publishes the ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'' and ''[[Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy]]''.

==Careers in agricultural economics==

Graduates from agricultural and applied economics departments find jobs in many sectors of the economy: agricultural management, agribusiness, commodities markets, education, the financial sector, government, natural resource and environmental management, real estate, and public relations. Careers in agricultural economics require at least a bachelor's degree, and research careers in the field require graduate-level training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Careers in Agricultural Economics: Job Options and Requirements | author = Education Portal | year=  2014 | url = http://education-portal.com/articles/Careers_in_Agricultural_Economics_Job_Options_and_Requirements.html | accessdate = 2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 study by the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce rated agricultural economics tied for 8th out of 171 fields in terms of employability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What's the Value of an Agricultural Economics Degree? | authors = Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics, the Ohio State University | year=  2014 | url = http://aede.osu.edu/about-us/news/what%E2%80%99s-value-agricultural-economics-degree-answer-987-chance-you%E2%80%99ll-have-job-after | accessdate = 2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What's It Worth?

'''Alexandre Petrovic''' (1925 - November 22, 2003) was a scientist who is known for formulating  the [[Theories of Craniofacial Growth|Cybernetic Theory of Craniofacial Growth]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shay|first1=Robert|title=In Memoriam|journal=AJODO|date=2003|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com.online.uchc.edu/S0889540603010783/1-s2.0-S0889540603010783-main.pdf?_tid=f1acc5ac-a1a2-11e5-8dca-00000aacb360&amp;acdnat=1450015871_e64cb54f6142151a048c33c04e9ebf77|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Alex was born in [[Belgrade]], Serbia. His father was a Serbian physician who at that time was doing his post-graduate training in surgery at [[University of Strasbourg]] School of Medicine. After birth, Alex's mother and him joined their father in [[Strasbourg]] where they lived for about 10 years before returning to Belgrade. Petrovic obtained his Medical degree in 1954, did his speciality in hematology in 1957 and his Doctorate in 1961. He did his Postdoc fellowship at [[McGill University]], Canada in 1962.

He was a Professor of physiology and physiopathology at [[Louis Pasteur University]] . He also served as a visiting Professor at Department of Orthodontics at [[Louisiana State University School of Dentistry]] where he taught craniofacial biology and research methodology.

==Career==
He was the founder and long time director of Research Laboratory for Craniofacial Cartilage and Bone Growth Center. He also helmed the directorship for [[French Institute of Health and Medical Research]]. Dr. Petrovic is known for developing a cybernetic model of growth to help understand how the facial growth takes places through the different control processes. Dr. Petrovic was first introduced to American Orthodontic community at Moyer's Growth Symposium at [[University of Michigan School of Dentistry]].

Dr. Petrovic's lab was known to introduce orthodontics to the following ideas &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Petrovic, Alexandre G.|url=https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=7007153382|website=SCOPUS|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1967, he demonstrated that amount and growth rate of the cartilage in condyle can be changed due to the Orthopedic forces
* Growth categorization of the human tissue level growth can be used as a predictor of jaw growth and treatment outcome when coupled with cephalometric analysis.

'''Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery''' ('''ALCAPA''' or '''Bland-White-Garland syndrome''' or '''White-Garland syndrome''') is a rare [[congenital anomalies|congenital anomaly]] in which the [[left coronary artery]] (LCA) branches off the [[pulmonary artery]] instead of the [[aortic sinus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0004576/ |title=Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery |publisher=A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia |accessdate=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After birth, the pressure in other coronary arteries (namely the [[right coronary artery|RCA]]) will have a pressure that exceeds the LCA and [[collateral circulation]] will increase. This, ultimately, can lead to blood flowing from the RCA into the LCA (retrograde) and into the pulmonary artery, thus forming a [[left-to-right shunt]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crawford|first1=Michael|last2=DiMarco|first2=John|last3=Paulus|first3=Walter|date=September 24, 2009|title=Cardiology|publisher=Mosby|isbn=0723434859|page=229|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The syndrome is named for [[Edward Franklin Bland]], [[Paul Dudley White]], and [[Joseph Garland (physician)|Joseph Garland]].

==Policies and activities==

===Patient safety===

The California Nurses Association is well known for its long history of advocacy for direct care registered nurses and patient care protections.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Under [[RoseAnn DeMoro]]'s leadership, CNA gained attention for its sponsorship of landmark legislative and regulatory reforms, including the nation's first mandated registered [[Nursing shortage|nurse-to-patient ratios]] in California which were sponsored by CNA.&lt;ref name="Aiken2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aiken LH, Sloane DM, Cimiotti JP, Clarke SP, Flynn L, Seago JA, Spetz J, Smith HL|title=Implications of the California nurse staffing mandate for other states|journal=Health Serv Res|date=August 2010|volume=45|issue=4|pages=904–21|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2010.01114.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6773.2010.01114.x/full|accessdate=6 November 2019|pmc=2908200|pmid=20403061}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ratio law, which requires hospitals to maintain a minimum number of nurses in all hospital units at all times to assure patient safety, was signed in 1999 by then-California Gov. [[Gray Davis]]. The ratios were implemented in 2004. When California Gov. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] sought to roll back key portions of the law in late 2004 at the request of the California hospital industry, CNA led a successful year-long campaign to challenge Schwarzegger and protect the law.

A subsequent study evaluated the effect on outcomes for nurses and patients by comparing outcomes in California in the subsequent two years with those of New Jersey and Pennsylvania — two similar states without such mandates.&lt;ref name="Aiken2010"/&gt; There was substantial compliance with the mandate in California, with over 80% compliance rates reported across several different units of surveyed hospitals; equivalent levels of non-mandated compliance in the comparator states were considerably lower, at 19%, 52%, and 63% compliance in medical/surgical, [[pediatric medicine|pediatric]], and [[intensive care unit]]s (ICUs) in New Jersey and 33%, 66%, and 71% in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Aiken2010"/&gt; After extensive adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics, the study revealed statistically significant relationships between the nurse-to-patient ratio and 30-day mortality and [[failure to rescue]] (FTR — that is, failure to prevent a clinically-important deterioration, such as death or permanent disability, from a complication of an underlying illness or of medical care) in all three states.&lt;ref name="Aiken2010"/&gt; In particular, for every additional patient added to a nurse's workload, the odds of patient death increased by in 13% California, 10% in New Jersey, and by a factor of 6% in Pennsylvania after adjusting for these factors. Across all three states, facilities with nurse-to-patient ratios consistent with those mandated in California were associated with lower rates of nursing [[Occupational burnout|burnout]], and nurses reported consistently better quality of care.&lt;ref name="Aiken2010"/&gt;

CNA was also the principal sponsor of numerous other items of legislation promoting patient safety, including laws requiring [[whistle-blower]] protection for hospital employees who report unsafe conditions, barring discrimination based on medical conditions or genetic characteristics, safeguards on who can provide telephone medical advice, and expanded legal protections for patients harmed by [[health maintenance organization]] (HMO) abuses.

Additionally, CNA won changes in state regulations to assure that every patient be assessed by a registered nurse and limiting unsafe assignment of RNs to work in hospital areas for which they do not have clinical expertise.

===National health care reform===

CNA/NNOC has drawn national attention for campaigns on behalf of patients denied medical treatment recommended by their physicians.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The CNA/NNOC is a primary national organizational advocate of the [[United States National Health Care Act]] (HR 676). The bill would establish a [[single-payer health care|single-payer]] national public health care insurance plan, essentially an improved equal-treatment [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] for all Americans.

On June 19, 2008, CNA/NNOC joined with other health care, labor, and community activists, and patients in sponsoring a day of protest against the insurance industry in 19 cities across the U.S. calling for enactment of HR 676.

===Public profile===

A California [[Field Poll]] in April 2008 found that CNA has the highest favorable rating among all groups, politicians, and institutions involved in public policy debates over health care reform in the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.field.com/fieldpollonline/subscribers/Rls2267.pdf California Field Poll, Release #2267, Release date: Monday, April 28, 2008 By Mark DiCamillo and Mervin Field]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2008, the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] television show with [[Bill Moyers]] featured a segment on CNA/NNOC describing a campaign conducted by the organization saying all Americans should be entitled to the same level of care available to Vice President Dick Cheney and members of Congress. 

The growing achievements of CNA and NNU received much national attention in 2010.
A profile of CNA and DeMoro in ''[[Business Week]]'', July 22, 2010, noted, "Under DeMoro, the union threw itself into the broader fight for patients' rights in the face of consolidation in hospital chains and insurers. The NNU simply takes that fight national, says DeMoro." ''[[The Washington Post]]'', November 20, 2010 described "an aggressive strategy by a national nurses union, experts say: Its members are growing in numbers, and they have not been afraid to walk picket lines." The San Francisco Chronicle, in an article headlined, "Nurses union becomes potent political force," November 24, 2010, wrote, "The Oakland-based California Nurses Association has made its mark by delivering some powerful political punches with a combination of entertaining theater and savvy strategizing."

==History==

The California Nurses Association was formed in 1903 as the California State Nurses Association.

CNA was the first nurses union in the U.S. to win collective bargaining contracts for nurses when [[Shirley Carew Titus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-01-01|title=Titus, Shirley Carew (1892–1967)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2588823410.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;advocated for agreements with the East Bay Hospital Conference for minimum salaries, [[time-and-a-half]] pay for overtime, shift differentials for night and weekend work, a 40-hour work week, paid holidays, vacations, and sick leave, and employer-paid health insurance.

In 1976, California established the first-in-the-nation requirements for safe RN staffing by adopting a CNA-sponsored law requiring no more than two patients per RN in intensive care units.

In 1992-1993, CNA established a new model for nursing organizations and unions in response to corporate hospital industry changes that resulted in reduced patient care standards and growing replacement of RNs with unlicensed staff, and the domination of most nursing organizations by nursing executives. Responding to growing demands for forceful protections for nurses and patients by the 90 percent of CNA members who were provided direct patient care, the CNA administration fired 13 CNA staff, including then-collective bargaining director Rose Ann DeMoro, and suspended four top leaders of the elected union arm of CNA. In response, CNA nurses staged a staff nurse revolt, building broad support among California nurses, winning a legal challenge to re-instate the fired staff and suspended leaders, and electing the first staff nurse majority on the CNA board. In September, 1993, the new staff nurse majority took office, and hired DeMoro as CNA Executive Director.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In 1994, CNA began an aggressive challenge to hospital restructuring plans by opposing reductions in care standards, holding educational workshops for nurses across the state, and establishing a national "Patient Watch" program to assist patients harmed by unsafe hospital practices.

In 1995, CNA withdrew from the nurse executive dominated [[American Nurses Association]], a pattern later followed by other state nurses associations.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

From 1997-1998, CNA waged a major battle with HMO giant [[Kaiser Permanente]] over its efforts to force sweeping contract concessions on RNs with strikes by 7,500 RNs at 47 Kaiser hospitals and clinics in Northern and Central California, and a successful campaign to oppose Kaiser hospital closures in Oakland, Richmond, and Martinez.

In 1999, CNA culminated a long campaign by winning passage of a landmark law, the first in the nation, requiring minimum RN-to-patient staffing ratios in all hospital units.

From 2001-2003, CNA won numerous union elections, especially in large hospital chains run by Catholic Healthcare West and Tenet Healthcare.

In 2004, CNA founded the National Nurses Organizing Committee in response to the requests of direct care RNs across the nation for a stronger voice to improve RN and patient care standards.  The CNA website [May 10, 2008] claims the group is the fastest-growing union in the United States, adding that 80,000 RNs are currently members of CNA/NNOC.

{{Wikinews|Unions battle in Ohio over hospital workers|CNA}}

In April 2008, the CNA/NNOC clashed with [[SEIU]] over an agreement between SEIU and Catholic Healthcare Partners of Ohio. CNA/NNOC labeled the election a "sham." SEIU and Catholic Healthcare Partners cancelled the election for 8,000 workers in 9 Ohio hospitals on whether to have SEIU representation.  NNOC contends that the agreement fits SEIU's pattern of forging controversial agreements with employers that sacrifice public protections and workplace standards in exchange for more members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20080616/kaplan Labor's Growing Pains]&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict continued until March, 2009, when CNA/NNOC and SEIU announced that the unions would cooperate to organize hospital employees, with nurses joining the nurses union and other hospital staff joining the SEIU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/19/health/19union.html |title=S.E.I.U. and Nurses Union End Bitter Rivalry |date=2009-03-19 |accessdate=2009-03-19 | work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Greenhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National Nurses United established
 
On February 18, 2009, CNA/NNOC announced that it is joining with two other nurses unions, the [[Massachusetts Nurses Association]] and the [[United American Nurses]], to create a 150,000-member union. The organization is called  [[National Nurses United]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calnurses.org/media-center/in-the-news/2009/december/it-s-official-three-unions-merge-to-form-nurses-super-union.html |title=It’s Official: Three Unions Merge to Form Nurses ‘Super Union’ |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is affiliated with the [[AFL-CIO]].  Deborah Burger, co-president of CNA/NNOC said that the new group is intended to give registered nurses a national voice and more organizing strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/02/19/BU6I1609SJ.DTL |title=Nurses unions to combine |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2009-02-19 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=George | last=Raine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 2009, CNA joined with the Massachusetts Nurses Association and United American Nurses to found National Nurses United, the largest union and professional association of registered nurses in U.S. history. In its founding convention in Phoenix, NNU delegates pledged to:

* Advance the interests of direct care nurses and patients across the U.S.
* Organize all direct care RNs "into a single organization capable of exercising influence over the healthcare industry, governments, and employers."
* Promote effective collective bargaining representation to all NNU affiliates to promote the economic and professional interests of all direct care RNs.
* Expand the voice of direct care RNs and patients in public policy, including the enactment of safe nurse to patient ratios and patient advocacy rights in Congress and every state.
* Win "healthcare justice, accessible, quality healthcare for all, as a human right."

In its first year, NNU cited many accomplishments, including:

* Organizing more than 8,000 RNs in Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Nevada, Texas, and Washington, DC.
* Playing a key role in election campaigns, especially in California where CNA members were influential in helping defeat billionaire Republican gubernatorial candidate [[Meg Whitman]] and Nevada where CNA and NNU helped defeat [[Sharron Angle]] and re-elect Senate Majority leader [[Harry Reid]]. The California campaign garnered national attention, especially with the street theater protests featuring a mock Queen Meg to critique Whitman's unprecedented spending and campaign style.

On January 3, 2013, the CNA joined forces with the National Union Of Healthcare Workers (NUHW) to form a new union, NUHW-CNA. Part of the motivation regarding the affiliation was the 2013 election for 43.000 Kaiser service and tech workers represented at the time by  CNA rival, SEIU-UHW. Despite CNA support, SEIU-UHW won the election and the partnership between CNA and NUHW eventually ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hananel|first=Sam|title=Health Care Alliance Could threaten larger rival|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Health-union-alliance-could-threaten-larger-rival-4164853.php|publisher=SF Gate/AP|accessdate=1-4-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CNA supports he Inclusive Prosperity Act (H.R. 1144/S. 434 Ellison) otherwise known as the Robin Hood Tax, which would place a tax on the sale of stocks,bonds and derivatives, and the single payer bill HR676 (Conyers) which would set up a government-run, non-profit health insurance system covering all US residents. CNA was also the first labor union to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential run in 2016/17.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.robinhoodtax.org/media/rep-ellison-reintroduces-financial-transaction-tax&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnhp.org/facts/what-is-single-payer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2489">'''Cannabis in Mauritius''' is illegal; locally it is known as '''gandia'''.

==History==
Cannabis was banned in the British colony of [[Mauritius]] in 1840:
{{quote|Whereas it results from the reports made to the Governor that a plant or herb commonly called and known by the name of Gandia (cannabis indiae [sic]) is daily imported and openly sold in the Colony, to a considerable extent, the use of which, being carried to excess among the labouring class, is productive of the most pernicious effects, often exciting them to disorderly conduct and in some cases causing death ;
It therefore becomes urgent that prompt and efficient measures be resorted to for preventing abuses of so grave a nature ;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Collection of the Laws of Mauritius and Its Dependencies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ktHAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA541|year=1867|publisher=By the authority of the Government|pages=541–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Usage==
A 1974 report on addiction noted that cannabis was usually smoked in cigarette rolls or clay pipes, but was mixed into cakes or sweets, or the beverage [[bhang]]. The writer noted it was rarely sniffed as snuff as "it burns the nose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Association of Psychiatrists in Africa 1974 Workshop: Alcoholism and Drug Addiction, 18-24 September, 1974, Nairobi, Kenya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TIQbAQAAMAAJ|year=1974|publisher=International Council on Alcohol and Addictions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reform==
In February 1999, a rally was held calling for legalization of cannabis. The famed Mauritian musician [[Kaya (Mauritian musician)|Kaya]] performed, and publicly smoked cannabis at the event. He was detained by police, and four days later died in custody.&lt;ref name="MayModood2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen May|author2=Tariq Modood|author3=Judith Squires|title=Ethnicity, Nationalism, and Minority Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ulPgoN0gBMC&amp;pg=PA86|date=11 November 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-60317-1|pages=86–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Case mix''', also '''casemix''' and '''patient mix''', is a term used within [[healthcare]] as a synonym for [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]]; essentially, a case mix groups statistically related patients.&lt;ref name="NCO"&gt;{{cite web|title=NHS National Casemix Office|url=http://digital.nhs.uk/casemix|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example case mix might be male patients under the age of 50, who present with a [[myocardial infarction]] and also undergo emergency [[coronary artery bypass surgery]].

At a local level, such as a single hospital; the data within a case mix may relate to the activity of an individual consultant, a specific [[Specialty (medicine)|speciality]] or a particular unit (such as a ward). On a wider level; it is possible to compare the case mix of hospitals, regions, and even countries.&lt;ref name="NCO" /&gt; Whilst a case mix will often include a condition or diagnosis, as well as any treatment received; it can also include demographics, such as gender or age, and a specific time range.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Conditions and treatments are often captured using a [[medical classification]] system, such as [[ICD-10]], in a process called [[clinical coding]]. The practice of coding, essentially groups patients using statistical codes. The coded data can be grouped further into [[Diagnosis-related group|Diagnosis-Related Groups]] (DRGs), which are used in the [[medical billing|billing]] process by hospitals and practices; as the "cost per item" of healthcare is based on the casemix.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Background==
Prior to the introduction of nationally consistent Activity Based Funding (ABF) by the Commonwealth Government, Casemix based funding was the key funding model used in Australian health care services for reimbursement of the cost of patient care.

In the Netherlands, the casemix system is called a "DBC" (Dutch:''Diagnosebehandelcombinatie''), and can be defined as a predefined average care package, which is applied with a fixed price when a specific diagnosis occurs.&lt;ref name=DBC&gt;[http://www.dbconderhoud.nl/Over-de-DBC-systematiek/Information-in-english DBC website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Casemix is a system that measures hospital performance, aiming to reward initiatives that increase efficiency in hospitals. It also serves as an information tool that allows [[policy maker]]s to understand the nature and complexity of [[health care]] delivery.

[[Diagnosis-related group|Diagnosis-Related Groups]] (DRGs) is the best-known classification system that is used in this funding model. It classifies acute inpatient episodes into a number of manageable categories based on clinical condition and resource consumption.  A single acute episode of inpatient care is allocated to one DRG using coded clinical information derived from the patient’s medical record. This information is coded by the Health Information Managers in order to allocate a DRG.  Each DRG is allocated a ‘weight’, which is dependent on the average cost of inputs (e.g. nursing, diagnostic services, procedures) required to achieve the appropriate patient outcome. The facility is reimbursed a predetermined amount for each patient episode.

==Classification systems==
The casemix system introduces a kind of [[Activity Based Costing]] to the health profession. However the complexities of the system (in the Netherlands, over 100,000 DBC's can be theoretically charged) has led new initiatives to link billable activities directly to international standards, such as the [[ICD-10]].&lt;ref name=DBC/&gt; This will eventually allow the billing processes to become more aligned in their classification schemes with the [[electronic patient record]].

==Casemix systems for mental health==
Because mental health treatment does not lend itself to fixed price costing, other exceptions are made by insurance companies for payment in the case of longer term casemix averages.&lt;ref name=DBC/&gt;

In '''chronotherapy''', an attempt is made to move bedtime and rising time later and later each day, around the clock, until a person is sleeping on a normal schedule.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} This treatment can be used by people with [[delayed sleep phase disorder]] who generally cannot reset their [[circadian rhythm]] by moving their bedtime and rising time earlier.

== Example ==

Here's an example of how chronotherapy could work over a week's course of treatment, with the patient going to sleep 3 hours later every day until the desired sleep and waketime is reached.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

* '''Day 1:''' sleep 05:00 to 13:00
* '''Day 2:''' sleep 08:00 to 16:00
* '''Day 3:''' sleep 11:00 to 19:00
* '''Day 4:''' sleep 14:00 to 22:00
* '''Day 5:''' sleep 17:00 to 01:00
* '''Day 6:''' sleep 20:00 to 04:00
* '''Day 7 and thereafter:''' sleep 23:00 to 07:00

While this technique can provide respite from [[sleep deprivation]] for people who must wake early for school or work, the new sleep and wake times can only be maintained by following a strictly disciplined timetable for sleeping and rising.

== Other forms of sleep phase chronotherapy ==

A modified chronotherapy&lt;ref&gt;Thorpy et al. in J Adolesc Health Care, 1988;9.&lt;/ref&gt; is called '''controlled sleep deprivation with phase advance''', SDPA. One stays awake one whole night and day, then goes to bed 90 minutes ''earlier'' than usual and maintains the new bedtime for a week. This process is repeated weekly until the desired bedtime is reached.

Sometimes, although extremely infrequently, "reverse" chronotherapy &amp;ndash; i.e., gradual movements of bedtime and rising time ''earlier'' each day &amp;ndash; has been used in treatment of patients with abnormally short circadian rhythms, in an attempt to move their bedtimes to ''later'' times of the day. Because circadian rhythms substantially shorter than 24 hours are extremely rare, this type of chronotherapy has remained largely experimental.

== Side effects ==

The safety of chronotherapy is not fully known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Morgenthaler |first=TI |author2=Lee-Chiong T |author3=Alessi C |author4=Friedman L |author5=Aurora N |author6=Boehlecke B |author7=Brown T |author8=Chesson AL |author9=Kapur V |author10=Maganti R |author11=Owens J |author12=Pancer J |author13=Swick TJ |author14=Zak R |date=November 2007 |title=Standards of Practice Committee of the AASM.

Any deviation in schedule tends to allow the body clock to shift later again.

Chronotherapy has been known to cause [[non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder]] in at least three recorded cases, as reported in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' in 1992. Animal studies have suggested that such lengthening could "slow the intrinsic rhythm of the body clock to such an extent that the normal 24-hour day no longer lies within its range of entrainment."&lt;ref name="NEJM1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oren |first=Dan A. |author2=Thomas A.

The '''Columbus Air Force''' was the nickname for a group of pilots involved in smuggling marijuana to the U.S. in the 1960s and early 1970s.  The group was based out of [[Columbus, New Mexico]], a village next to the Mexican border.  The group were reportedly the first pilots to transport drugs across the border by small aircraft.  They were headed by Martin Willard Houltin, who served as a World War II B-29 bomber pilot in the [[United States Army Air Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;Sky-High On the Pot Patrol by Richard Cunningham The Sydney Morning Herald September 7, 1975 [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19750907&amp;id=swRkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XuYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1392,1478778]&lt;/ref&gt; The other members of the Columbus Air Force were Robert Burke, Tim Morrison, Michael Francis, Kenneth Croucher, and Curly Phillips.

A joint state/federal task force, named Operation Sky Night, and headed by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] was responsible for capturing the members of the Columbus Air Force in October 1973.  They were represented in court by criminal defense attorney Lee Chagra, the brother of [[Jamiel Chagra]], who was another major drug trafficker.  Because of some legal problems with the wire-taps used to ensnare them, the group ended up pleading to only minor charges and received probation.  However, in 1974 six members of the group were indicted and convicted on federal conspiracy charges arising out of the same case, and were sentenced to two consecutive five-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;http://vlex.com/vid/martin-willard-houltin-kenneth-phillips-36870845&lt;/ref&gt;  Houltin was arrested twice more in his life, once serving a 16-month sentence in 1980 and then in 1993 having the charges dropped because he was suffering Alzheimer's disease.  He died in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Albuquerque Journal February 21, 1999 [http://www.marijuanalibrary.org/ii/990221.html www.marijuanalibrary.org/ii/990221.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Columbus Air Force received a lot of notoriety after their arrest, and were featured in the ''New York Times Magazine'', ''Argosy'', and even ''Popular Mechanics''.&lt;ref&gt;Popular Mechanics August 1974 "It was going to be 'a piece of cake,' thought the dope smugglers- until..."

The song "Treetop Flyer," written by [[Stephen Stills]] and performed by [[Jimmy Buffett]] on his album [[Banana Wind]] (as a hidden track), is reportedly about the Columbus Air Force. Ironically, the airstrip in Columbus where the Columbus Air Force flew out of was later the site of a RADAR-equipped aerostat balloon manned by the [[United States Customs Service]], which was used to detect drug traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swaviator.com/html/issueJA05/ChasingPanchoVilla.html An adventure flight to Palomas, Mexico swaviator.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[agriculture]] '''cultural control''' is the practice of modifying the growing environment to reduce the prevalence of unwanted [[pest (animal)|pest]]s. Examples include changing soil [[pH]] or [[fertility]] levels, [[irrigation]] practices, amount of sunlight, temperature, or the use of beneficial animals (e.g. chickens) or insects (e.g. ladybugs) (biological control). Using cultural control before chemical control can reduce detrimental effects to the ecosystem surrounding the growing environment.

Rolando Espinosa was a Filipino politician who served as mayor of [[Albuera, Leyte|Albuera]], [[Leyte]]. He was elected to the position in the May [[Philippine general election, 2016|2016 Philippine elections]]. Espinosa's campaign focused on combating illegal drugs.&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date=3 August 2016  |title=Who is Rolando Espinosa, Sr.? |trans-title= |medium= |language= |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/video/news/08/02/16/who-is-rolando-espinosa-sr |access-date=6 December 2016 |archive-url= |archive-date= |format= |time= |location= |publisher=ABS-CBN News Network |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his political career, Espinosa already owned three houses and a hotel in Albuera. The Philippine National Police has alleged that his son Kerwin Espinosa is involved in the illegal drug trade.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

===First surrender===
On August 1, 2016, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who [[Philippine drug war|was conducting a nationwide campaign against illegal drugs]], asked Espinosa and his son Kerwin to surrender themselves within 24 hours "on the grounds of drug-trafficking and coddling." Duterte said that the police would arrest and possibly shoot them if they resisted arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duterte orders drug-accused Mayor to surrender within 24 hours|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/08/01/16/duterte-orders-drug-accused-mayor-to-surrender-within-24-hours|accessdate=14 November 2016|work=ABS-CBN News|date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing for his life, Espinosa voluntarily surrendered himself at [[Camp Crame]] to [[Philippine National Police]] (PNP) Director General [[Ronald Dela Rosa]] on Aug 2. Espinosa admitted that his son Kerwin was involved in the illegal drug trade in [[Eastern Visayas]] and urged Kerwin, who had a standing arrest warrant, to surrender himself to authorities. However, Espinosa denied using money from illegal drugs to finance his election campaign. He agreed to undergo drug testing and was turned over to the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group. At the time of his arrest, the mayor did not have a standing arrest warrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nicolas|first1=Fiona|title=Leyte mayor surrenders for fear for his life, heeds Duterte’s call against drugs|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/08/02/albuera-leyte-mayor-espinosa-surrenders-pnp-dela-rosa-war-against-drugs.html|accessdate=14 November 2016|publisher=CNN Philippines|date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 5:30 a.m (UTC +8) on August 3, the police had a shootout with twelve armed men with alleged links to Espinosa in [[Barangay]] Benolho in Albuera. Six of the men were killed, and {{convert|237|g|oz}} of ''shabu'' ([[methamphetamine]]) worth {{Philippine peso|1.9 million}}, along with some firearms, were seized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=6 alleged Espinosa men killed in Leyte shootout with police|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/576143/news/regions/6-alleged-espinosa-men-killed-in-leyte-shootout-with-police|accessdate=14 November 2016|work=GMA News|date=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, 2016, CIDG [[Regions of the Philippines|Region 8]] and the Albuera Police Station filed criminal charges against the Espinosas.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite news|title=From the arrest to the killing of Albuera Mayor Rolando Espinosa|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/587653/news/nation/from-the-arrest-to-the-killing-of-albuera-mayor-rolando-espinosa|accessdate=14 November 2016|work=GMA News|date=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 6, Espinosa, along with his daughter and wife, left the PNP director general's residence in Camp Crame and went back to Leyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Espinosas leave PNP’s White House|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/576594/news/nation/espinosas-leave-pnp-s-white-house|accessdate=14 November 2016|work=GMA News|date=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 7, Duterte announced a list of government officials, police officers, and law practitioners who were allegedly involved in the illegal drug trade in the country. Espinosa was included in Duterte's list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DUTERTE'S LIST: 'Narco' politicos, lawmen, judges|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/08/07/16/dutertes-list-narco-politicos-lawmen-judges|accessdate=14 November 2016|work=ABS-CBN News|date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Espinosa resumed work as mayor on August 16.

===Second surrender and arrest===
On August 24, 2016, Espinosa went to the police to seek custody due to threats to his life. Espinosa promised to reveal his son's connections. Three days later, the police took Espinosa into custody. On October 5, Espinosa was arrested for alleged possession of illegal drugs when the police found at least {{convert|11|kg|lb}} of methamphetamine at the Espinosa [[ancestral home]] in Albuerra.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;

Espinosa was brought to the Baybay City [[Regional Trial Court]], which ordered him to be detained at the [[Baybay, Leyte|Baybay City]] Provincial Jail. In October, he was charged with illegal drug possession by the regional trial court. He was also brought to the Western Leyte Provincial Hospital where he underwent a medical examination.&lt;ref name=arrest&gt;{{cite news|title=Police arrest Leyte town mayor linked to drugs|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/10/05/16/police-arrest-leyte-town-mayor-linked-to-drugs|accessdate=14 November 2016|work=ABS-CBN News|date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Judge Tarcelo Sabarre Jr. of the Regional Trial Court Branch 30 issued two search warrants against Rolando Espinosa and Raul Yap, who was also suspected of being involved in illegal drugs, at the Baybay City Provincial Jail in Barangay Hipusngo. The [[Criminal Investigation and Detection Group]] (CIDG) of [[Eastern Visayas|Region 8]], led by Police Chief Inspector Leo Laraga, served the warrants in the early morning of November 5, 2016. According to the CIDG, Espinosa and Yap first shot at the CIDG operatives, resulting in a shootout between the two men and the CIDG. Espinosa and Yap died in the alleged firefight.&lt;ref name="gmanewsshotdead"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parco|first1=Bernadette|title=Albuera Mayor Espinosa shot dead in jail cell|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/587609/news/regions/albuera-mayor-espinosa-shot-dead-in-jail-cell|accessdate=14 November 2016|work=GMA News|date=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
The [[Bagong Alyansang Makabayan]] expressed concerns over strong indications that the death of Espinosa was a "cold-blooded murder," saying that the circumstances of his death were highly questionable. They urged the relief of CIDG operatives involved in the incident as well as of the CIDG Section 8 leadership, pending a "thorough and impartial" investigation. The group also said that those implicated in the list of alleged drug lords may take advantage of Espinosa's killing. They urged Duterte to condemn Rolando Espinosa's killing and labeled the incident as a setback for the president's [[Philippine Drug War|war on drugs.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gonzales|first1=Yuji Vincent|title=Mayor Espinosa’s killing sets back Duterte’s drug war—Bayan|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/841796/mayor-espinosas-killing-sets-back-dutertes-drug-war-bayan|accessdate=14 November 2016|work=INQUIRER.net|date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commission on Human Rights (Philippines)|Commission on Human Rights]] and [[Karapatan]] also called for people involved in Espinosa's death to be held accountable. Karapatan in particular linked the police to "narcopolitics" and alleged that the CIDG conducted a "[[Assassination|rubout]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Colcol|first1=Erwin|title=Duterte urged to hold persons behind Espinosa death accountable|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/588503/news/nation/duterte-urged-to-hold-persons-behind-espinosa-death-accountable-nbsp|accessdate=14 November 2016|work=GMA News|date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the incident, Senator [[Panfilo Lacson]] called for the possible resumption of the Senate inquiry into deaths related to the [[Philippine war on drugs]]. He labeled the incident as a "clear case of extrajudicial killing" and as the "biggest challenge to the credibility of the PNP". Lacson alleged that there was a cover-up for "bigger personalities" and questioned why the CIDG, instead of a court sheriff, was sent, since Espinosa was already detained. He also alleged that Yap was killed so that there would be no witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Quismundo|first1=Tarra|title=Lacson: Mayor Espinosa’s slay a ‘clear case of extrajudicial killing’|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/841321/lacson-mayor-espinosa-extrajudicial-killing|accessdate=14 November 2016|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
===Investigation===
{{expert needed|Crime|section|date=December 2016}}
PNP Chief Ronald Dela Rosa ordered an investigation of the incident, promising that there would be no cover-up.&lt;ref name=shot4&gt;{{cite news|last1=Docdocan|first1=Ranulfo|title=Slain Mayor Espinosa shot 4 times, autopsy results show|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/06/16/slain-mayor-espinosa-shot-4-times-autopsy-results-show|accessdate=14 November 2016|work=ABS-CBN News|date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the same day as the CIDG operation, operatives arrived at the crime scene where they were apprised of a Super Caliber .38 pistol, a magazine of live ammunition, a small heat-sealed sachet of suspected methamphetamine, and drug paraphernalia in Espinosa's cell.&lt;ref name="gmanewsshotdead"/&gt;

A panel led by the Regional Director Chief Superintendent of region 8, a certain Beltejar, was formed to investigate the incident. The Regional Internal Affairs Service also planned to conduct a separate investigation.&lt;ref name="gmanewsshotdead"/&gt;

Video footage of the CIDG operations was found to be missing. An autopsy on Espinosa's body revealed that he was shot four times, with one bullet managing to exit the body. The findings of the study also raised the possibility that Espinosa may have been lying down when he was shot dead. Two of his expensive rings were also found to be missing. The bullets were sent to the regional crime laboratory for further investigation.&lt;ref name=shot4/&gt;

The [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|National Bureau of Investigation]] (NBI) also became involved in the case. In December 2016, the agency concluded that the death of Rolando Espinosa was a result of a rubout. It recommended the filing of murder and perjury charges against police personnel involved in the operation. The NBI described the arrest warrants, which served as the basis for the operation, as having been "maliciously obtained". It noted that Paul Olendan, whose perjured affidavit the warrant was based on, was in Leyte National High School in [[Tacloban]] at the time he claimed to have visited the Baybay Jail. The NBI added that there had been an anti-contraband operation on October 30, 2016 in the jail where Espinosa was detained, and that enforcers only found cellphones during that operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Araneta|first1=Sandy|last2=Bencito|first2=John Paolo|title=Murder raps eyed vs ‘Espinosa cops’|url=http://thestandard.com.ph/news/-main-stories/top-stories/223417/murder-raps-eyed-vs-espinosa-cops-.html|accessdate=6 December 2016|publisher=Manila Standard|date=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burial of Espinosa===
Espinosa was buried at the Catholic Cemetery in Albuera, Leyte on December 3, 2016, following a requiem mass at the Saint James Parish Church. His funeral procession was attended by 1,500 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gabieta|first1=Joey|title=A town in grief Hundreds join funeral rites for Espinosa Sr.|url=http://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/114822/town-grief-hundreds-join-funeral-rites-espinosa-sr|accessdate=6 December 2016|work=Cebu Daily News|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal and state governments, insurance companies and other large medical institutions are heavily promoting the adoption of [[Electronic health record|electronic health records]]. The US Congress included a formula of both incentives (up to $44,000 per physician under Medicare, or up to $65,000 over six years under Medicaid) and penalties (i.e. decreased Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to doctors who fail to use EMRs by 2015, for covered patients) for EMR/EHR adoption versus continued use of paper records as part of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, enacted as part of the, [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services 42 CFR Parts 412, 413, 422 et al.

==Coverage==
Even though Electronic health records systems with a [[Computerized physician order entry|computerized provider order entry]] (CPOE) have existed for more than 30 years, fewer than 10 percent of hospitals as of 2006 had a fully integrated system.&lt;ref name="SM001"&gt;Smaltz, Detlev and Eta Berner. ''The Executive's Guide to Electronic Health Records.'' (2007, Health Administration Press) p.03&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 survey by DesRoches et al. of 4484 physicians (62% response rate), 83% of all physicians, 80% of primary care physicians, and 86% of non-primary care physicians had no EHRs. "Among the 83% of respondents who did not have electronic health records, 16%" had bought, but not implemented an EHR system yet.&lt;ref name=desroches2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = DesRoches CM, Campbell EG, Rao SR, Donelan K, Ferris TG, Jha A, Kaushal R, Levy DE, Rosenbaum S, Shields AE, Blumenthal D | title = Electronic health records in ambulatory care—a national survey of physicians | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 359 | issue = 1 | pages = 50–60 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18565855 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMsa0802005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2009 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey of 5200 physicians (70% response rate) by the [[National Center for Health Statistics]] showed that 51.7% of office-based physicians did not use any EMR/EHR system.&lt;ref name=hsiao2010&gt;{{cite web|last=Hsiao|first=Chun-Ju| name-list-format = vanc |title=Electronic Medical Record/Electronic Health Record Systems of Office-based Physicians: United States, 2009 and Preliminary 2010 State Estimates|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/emr_ehr_09/emr_ehr_09.htm|work=NCHS Health E-Stat|publisher=CDC/National Center for Health Statistics|access-date=31 October 2011|date=Dec 8, 2010|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the CDC reported that the EMR adoption rate had steadily risen to 48.3 percent at the end of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuesoft.com/blog/are-more-doctors-adopting-ehrs/ Are More Doctors Adopting EHRs?] Retrieved 31 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an increase over 2008, when only 38.4% of office-based physicians reported using fully or partially electronic medical record systems (EMR) in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Health : United States, 2008]. Retrieved 15 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same study found that only 20.4% of all physicians reported using a system described as minimally functional and including the following features: orders for prescriptions, orders for tests, viewing laboratory or imaging results, and clinical progress notes. As of 2013, 78 percent of office physicians are using basic electronic medical records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/physician-ehr-adoption-trends.php|title=Office-based Physician Electronic Health Record Adoption|website=dashboard.healthit.gov|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, more than 80 percent of hospitals in the U.S.have adopted some type of EHR. Though within a hospital, the type of EHR data and mix varies significantly. Types of EHR data used in hospitals include structured data (e.g., medication information) and unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Big Data in Health Care|journal=The National Law Review|date=17 September 2014|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/big-data-health-care|access-date=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The healthcare industry spends only 2% of gross revenues on HIT, which is low compared to other information intensive industries such as finance, which spend upwards of 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Simon SR, Kaushal R, Cleary PD, Jenter CA, Volk LA, Poon EG, Orav EJ, Lo HG, Williams DH, Bates DW | title = Correlates of electronic health record adoption in office practices: a statewide survey | journal = Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 110–7 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17068351 | pmc = 2215070 | doi = 10.1197/jamia.M2187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Menachemi N, Perkins RM, van Durme DJ, Brooks RG | title = Examining the adoption of electronic health records and personal digital assistants by family physicians in Florida | journal = Informatics in Primary Care | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–9 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16848961 | doi =  | url = http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&amp;issn=1476-0320&amp;volume=14&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=1&amp;aulast=Menachemi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage of electronic medical records can vary depending on who the user is and how they are using it. Electronic medical records can help improve the quality of medical care given to patients. Many doctors and office-based physicians refuse to get rid of the traditional paper records. Harvard University has conducted an experiment in which they tested how doctors and nurses use electronic medical records to keep their patients' information up to date. The studies found that electronic medical records were very useful; a doctor or a nurse was able to find a patient's information fast and easy just by typing their name; even if it was misspelled. The usage of electronic medical records increases in some work places due to the ease of use of the system; whereas the president of the Canadian Family Practice Nurses Association says that using electronic medical records can be time consuming, and it isn't very helpful due to the complexity of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bleich HL, Slack WV | title = Reflections on electronic medical records: when doctors will use them and when they will not | journal = International Journal of Medical Informatics | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19939731 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2009.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center reported that doctors and nurses prefer to use a much more friendly user software due to the difficulty and time it takes for a medical staff to input the information as well as to find a patients information. A study was done and the amount of information that was recorded in the EMRs was recorded; about 44% of the patients information was recorded in the EMRs. This shows that EMRs are not very efficient most of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roukema J, Los RK, Bleeker SE, van Ginneken AM, van der Lei J, Moll HA | title = Paper versus computer: feasibility of an electronic medical record in general pediatrics | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 117 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–21 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16396855 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2004-2741 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of implementing an EMR system for smaller practices has also been criticized; data produced by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation demonstrates that the first year investment for an average five person practice is $162,000 followed by about $85,000 in maintenance fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Millman|first1=Jason| name-list-format = vanc |title=Electronic health records were supposed to be everywhere this year.

* Open source EMR systems exist, but have not seen widespread adoption of [[List of open-source healthcare software#Electronic health or medical record|open-source EMR system software]].

Beyond financial concerns there are a number of legal and ethical dilemmas created by increasing EMR use, including the risk of medical malpractice due to user error, server glitches that result in the EMR not being accessible, and increased vulnerability to hackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sittig DF, Singh H | title = Legal, ethical, and financial dilemmas in electronic health record adoption and use | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 127 | issue = 4 | pages = e1042–7 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21422090 | pmc = 3065078 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2010-2184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gamble|first1=Molly | name-list-format = vanc |title=5 Legal Issues Surrounding Electronic Medical Records|url=http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/legal-regulatory-issues/5-legal-issues-surrounding-electronic-medical-records.html|website=Becker's Hospital Review|publisher=Becker's Healthcare}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal status====
Electronic medical records, like other medical records, must be kept in unaltered form and authenticated by the creator.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives and Records Administration (NARA): [http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/bytopic/electronic-records/electronic-storage-media/critiss.html Long-Term Usability of Optical Media]. Retrieved 30 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Under data protection legislation, the responsibility for patient records (irrespective of the form they are kept in) is always on the creator and custodian of the record, usually a health care practice or facility. This role has been said{{by whom|date=October 2016}} to require changes such that the sole medico-legal record should be held elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Shabo, Amnon (2014): "It’s Time for Health Record Banking!" editorial to special issue of Methods of Information in Medicine, Vol. 53, No. 2, pp. 63–65 "change in current legislation so that the copy of a legally-authenticated medical record stored in an IHRB [Independent Health Record Bank] is the sole medico-legal record and healthcare providers are no longer required by the law to hold archives of medical records." page 65, [http://www.dx.doi.org/10.3414/ME13-02-0048]&lt;/ref&gt;  The physical medical records are the property of the medical provider (or facility) that prepares them.

The [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act]] (HITECH) ({{uspl|111|5}},§2.A.III &amp; B.4) (a part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|2009 stimulus package]]) set meaningful use of interoperable EHR adoption in the health care system as a critical national goal and incentivized EHR adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ehrmeaningfuluse/introduction.html|work=Meaningful Use|publisher=CDC|access-date=31 October 2011|author=CDC|authorlink=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=Jun 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=blumenthal2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blumenthal D | title = Launching HITECH | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 362 | issue = 5 | pages = 382–5 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20042745 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp0912825 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "goal is not adoption alone but 'meaningful use' of EHRs—that is, their use by providers to achieve significant improvements in care."&lt;ref name=blumenthaltavenner&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blumenthal D, Tavenner M | title = The "meaningful use" regulation for electronic health records | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 363 | issue = 6 | pages = 501–4 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20647183 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1006114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Title IV of the act promises maximum incentive payments for [[Medicaid]] to those who adopt and use "certified EHRs" of $63,750 over 6 years beginning in 2011. Eligible professionals must begin receiving payments by 2016 to qualify for the program. For Medicare the maximum payments are $44,000 over 5 years. Doctors who do not adopt an EHR by 2015 will be penalized 1% of Medicare payments, increasing to 3% over 3 years. In order to receive the EHR stimulus money, the [[HITECH Act]] requires doctors to show "meaningful use" of an EHR system. As of June 2010, there were no penalty provisions for Medicaid.

In 2017 the government announced its first [[False Claims Act]] settlement with an electronic health records vendor for misrepresenting its ability to meet “meaningful use” standards and therefore receive incentive payments. eClinicalWorks paid $155 million to settle charges that it had failed to meet all government requirements, failed to adequately test its software, failed to fix certain bugs, failed to ensure data portability, and failed to reliably record laboratory and diagnostic imaging orders.&lt;ref name="ecwdoj"&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Health Records Vendor to Pay $155 Million to Settle False Claims Act Allegations|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/electronic-health-records-vendor-pay-155-million-settle-false-claims-act-allegations|website=U.S. Department of Justice|access-date=16 October 2017|date=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also alleged that eClinicalWorks paid kickbacks to influential customers who recommended its products. The case marks the first time the government applied the federal Anti-Kickback Statute law to the promotion and sale of an electronic health records system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.phillipsandcohen.com/eclinicalworks-whistleblower-lawsuit/ "EHR vendor eClinicalWorks reaches ground-breaking $155 million whistleblower settlement"], Phillips &amp; Cohen LLP Press Release, May 31, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The False Claims Act lawsuit was brought by a whistleblower who was a New York City employee implementing eClinicalWorks’ system at Rikers Island Correctional Facility when he became aware of the software flaws. His “[[qui tam]]” case was later joined by the government.&lt;ref name="ecwdoj"/&gt; Notably, CMS has said it will not punish eClinicalWorks clients that "in good faith" attested to using the software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/cms-wont-punish-eclinicalworks-customers-meaningful-use-ehr-attestations|title=CMS won't punish eClinicalWorks customers for meaningful use EHR attestations|last=Sullivan|first=Tom| name-list-format = vanc |date=July 6, 2017|work=Healthcare IT News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Health information exchange]] (HIE) has emerged as a core capability for hospitals and physicians to achieve "meaningful use" and receive stimulus funding. Healthcare vendors are pushing HIE as a way to allow EHR systems to pull disparate data and function on a more interoperable level.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Starting in 2015, hospitals and doctors will be subject to financial penalties under Medicare if they are not using electronic health records.&lt;ref name="Pear"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/health/policy/14health.html?_r=1&amp;hpw | work=The New York Times | title=U.S. Issues Rules on Electronic Health Records | first=Robert | last=Pear  | name-list-format = vanc | date=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Goals and objectives====
* Improve care quality, safety, efficiency, and reduce health disparities
	
:: Quality and safety measurement
:: Clinical decision support (automated advice) for providers
:: Patient registries (e.g., "a directory of patients with diabetes")
	
* Improve care coordination
* Engage patients and families in their care
* Improve population and public health
:: Electronic laboratory reporting for reportable conditions (hospitals)
:: Immunization reporting to immunization registries
:: Syndromic surveillance (health event awareness)
	
* Ensure adequate privacy and security protections

====Quality====
Studies call into question whether, in real life, EMRs improve the quality of care.&lt;ref name="gabriel2008"&gt;{{cite web | last=Gabriel| first=Barbara | name-list-format = vanc | year=2008 | url=http://www.physicianspractice.com/index/fuseaction/articles.details/articleID/1203/page/1.htm | title=Do EMRs Make You a Better Doctor? | publisher=Physicians Practice| access-date=23 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2009 produced several articles raising doubts about EMR benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greenhalgh T, Potts HW, Wong G, Bark P, Swinglehurst D | title = Tensions and paradoxes in electronic patient record research: a systematic literature review using the meta-narrative method | journal = The Milbank Quarterly | volume = 87 | issue = 4 | pages = 729–88 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 20021585 | pmc = 2888022 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0009.2009.00578.x | url = http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/18821/ | archive-url = http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515123545/http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/18821/ | df = dmy-all | deadurl = yes | archive-date = 15 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major concern is the reduction of physician-patient interaction due to formatting constraints. For example, some doctors have reported that the use of check-boxes has led to fewer open-ended questions.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen GR, Grossman JM, O'Malley AS (2010).

====Meaningful use====
The main components of meaningful use are:
* The use of a certified EHR in a meaningful manner, such as e-prescribing.
* The use of certified EHR technology for electronic exchange of health information to improve quality of health care.
* The use of certified EHR technology to submit clinical quality and other measures.
In other words, providers need to show they're using certified EHR technology in ways that can be measured significantly in quality and in quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CMS EHR Meaningful Use Overview|url=http://www.cms.gov/ehrincentiveprograms/30_Meaningful_Use.asp|work=EHR Incentive Programs|publisher=Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services|access-date=31 October 2011|author=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services|authorlink=Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|date=Oct 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaningful use of EHRs intended by the US government incentives is categorized as follows:

* Improve care coordination
* Reduce healthcare disparities
* Engage patients and their families
* Improve population and public health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhai H, Iyer S, Ni Y |year=2014 |title=Mining a large-scale EHR with machine learning methods to predict all-cause 30-day unplanned readmissions |journal=ASE@360 Open Scientific Digital Library |url=http://www.ase360.org/handle/123456789/90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhai H, Brady P, Li Q, Lingren T, Ni Y, Wheeler DS, Solti I | title = Developing and evaluating a machine learning based algorithm to predict the need of pediatric intensive care unit transfer for newly hospitalized children | journal = Resuscitation | volume = 85 | issue = 8 | pages = 1065–71 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24813568 | pmc = 4087062 | doi = 10.1016/j.resuscitation.2014.04.009 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300957214004778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ensure adequate privacy and security

The Obama Administration's Health IT program intends to use federal investments to stimulate the market of electronic health records:

* Incentives: to providers who use IT
* Strict and open standards: To ensure users and sellers of EHRs work towards the same goal
* Certification of software: To provide assurance that the EHRs meet basic quality, safety, and efficiency standards

The detailed definition of "meaningful use" is to be rolled out in 3 stages over a period of time until 2017.  Details of each stage are hotly debated by various groups.&lt;ref name="Center for Medicare and Medicaid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt?open=512&amp;objID=1325&amp;parentname=CommunityPage&amp;parentid=21&amp;mode=2&amp;in_hi_userid=10741&amp;cached=true |title=What is Meaningful Use? &amp;#124; Policy Researchers &amp; Implementers &amp;#124; HealthIT.gov |publisher=Healthit.hhs.gov |access-date=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Meaningful use Stage 1=====

The first steps in achieving meaningful use are to have a certified electronic health record (EHR) and to be able to demonstrate that it is being used to meet the requirements. Stage 1 contains 25 objectives/measures for Eligible Providers (EPs) and 24 objectives/measures for eligible hospitals. The objectives/measures have been divided into a core set and menu set. EPs and eligible hospitals must meet all objectives/measures in the core set (15 for EPs and 14 for eligible hospitals). EPs must meet 5 of the 10 menu-set items during Stage 1, one of which must be a public health objective.&lt;ref name="The Office of the National Coordinator"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt?CommunityID=1206&amp;spaceID=399&amp;parentname=&amp;control=SetCommunity&amp;parentid=&amp;PageID=0&amp;space=CommunityPage&amp;in_hi_totalgroups=1&amp;in_hi_req_ddfolder=6652&amp;in_ra_topoperator=or&amp;in_hi_depth_1=0&amp;in_hi_req_page=20&amp;control=advancedstart&amp;in_hi_req_objtype=18&amp;in_hi_req_objtype=512&amp;in_hi_req_objtype=514&amp;in_hi_req_apps=1&amp;in_hi_revealed_1=0&amp;in_hi_userid=8969&amp;in_hi_groupoperator_1=or&amp;in_hi_model_mode=browse&amp;cached=false&amp;in_ra_groupoperator_1=or&amp;in_tx_fulltext=stage+1 |title=HealthIT.gov &amp;#124; the official site for Health IT information |publisher=Healthit.hhs.gov |access-date=4 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311120645/http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt?CommunityID=1206&amp;spaceID=399&amp;parentname=&amp;control=SetCommunity&amp;parentid=&amp;PageID=0&amp;space=CommunityPage&amp;in_hi_totalgroups=1&amp;in_hi_req_ddfolder=6652&amp;in_ra_topoperator=or&amp;in_hi_depth_1=0&amp;in_hi_req_page=20&amp;control=advancedstart&amp;in_hi_req_objtype=18&amp;in_hi_req_objtype=512&amp;in_hi_req_objtype=514&amp;in_hi_req_apps=1&amp;in_hi_revealed_1=0&amp;in_hi_userid=8969&amp;in_hi_groupoperator_1=or&amp;in_hi_model_mode=browse&amp;cached=false&amp;in_ra_groupoperator_1=or&amp;in_tx_fulltext=stage+1 |archive-date=11 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To receive federal incentive money, CMS requires participants in the Medicare EHR Incentive Program to "attest" that during a 90-day reporting period, they used a certified EHR and met Stage 1 criteria for meaningful use objectives and clinical quality measures. For the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program, providers follow a similar process using their state's attestation system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physicianspractice.com/meaningful-use/content/article/1462168/2009082 Torrieri, Marisa  "Dealing with Meaningful Use Attestation Aggravation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108093124/http://www.physicianspractice.com/meaningful-use/content/article/1462168/2009082 |date=8 January 2012 }}. ''Physicians Practice''.  January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Meaningful use Stage 2=====

The government released its final ruling on achieving Stage 2 of meaningful use in August 2012. Eligible providers will need to meet 17 of 20 core objectives in Stage 2, and fulfill three out of six menu objectives. The required percentage of patient encounters that meet each objective has generally increased over the Stage 1 objectives.

While Stage 2 focuses more on information exchange and patient engagement, many large EHR systems have this type of functionality built into their software, making it easier to achieve compliance. Also, for those eligible providers who have successfully attested to Stage 1, meeting Stage 2 should not be as difficult, as it builds incrementally on the requirements for the first stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physicianspractice.com/meaningful-use/content/article/1462168/2098253 "Meaningful Use: Stage 2 Regulations Overview"] Robert Anthony, CMS, 30 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physicianspractice.com/meaningful-use/ehr-incentive-program-progress-report "EHR Incentive Program: A Progress Report"] Marisa Torrieri, Physicians Practice, September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Meaningful use Stage 3=====

On March 20, 2015 [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|CMS]] released its proposed rule for Stage 3 meaningful use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services | date = 30 March 2015 | title = Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Electronic Health Record Incentive Program-Stage 3 | url = https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/03/30/2015-06685/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-electronic-health-record-incentive-program-stage-3 | work = The Federal Register }}&lt;/ref&gt; These new rules focus on some of the tougher aspects of Stage 2 and require [[healthcare]] providers to vastly improve their EHR adoption and care delivery by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Jennifer | last = Bresnick | name-list-format = vanc | title = Breaking Down the Health IT Impacts of Stage 3 Meaningful Use | url = https://ehrintelligence.com/2015/03/23/breaking-down-the-health-it-impacts-of-stage-3-meaningful-use/ | date = 23 March 2015 | work = EHR Intelligence }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Barriers to adoption====

=====Costs=====
The price of EMR and provider uncertainty regarding the value they will derive from adoption in the form of return on investment have a significant influence on EMR adoption. In a project initiated by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information, surveyors found that hospital administrators and physicians who had adopted EMR noted that any gains in efficiency were offset by reduced productivity as the technology was implemented, as well as the need to increase information technology staff to maintain the system.

The U.S. Congressional Budget Office concluded that the cost savings may occur only in large integrated institutions like Kaiser Permanente, and not in small physician offices. They challenged the [[Rand Corporation]]'s estimates of savings.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Office-based physicians in particular may see no benefit if they purchase such a product—and may even suffer financial harm. Even though the use of health IT could generate cost savings for the health system at large that might offset the EMR's cost, many physicians might not be able to reduce their office expenses or increase their revenue sufficiently to pay for it. For example. the use of health IT could reduce the number of duplicated diagnostic tests. However, that improvement in efficiency would be unlikely to increase the income of many physicians. ...Given the ease at which information can be exchanged between health IT systems, patients whose physicians use them may feel that their privacy is more at risk than if paper records were used.&lt;ref name=cbo2008&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=9168 Evidence on the costs and benefits of health information technology.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Doubts have been raised about cost saving from EMRs by researchers at [[Harvard University]], the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]], [[Stanford University]], and others.

======Start-up costs======
In a survey by DesRoches et al. (2008), 66% of physicians without EHRs cited capital costs as a barrier to adoption, while 50% were uncertain about the investment. Around 56% of physicians without EHRs stated that financial incentives to purchase and/or use EHRs would facilitate adoption.&lt;ref name=desroches2008/&gt; In 2002, initial costs were estimated to be $50,000–70,000 per physician in a 3-physician practice. Since then, costs have decreased with increasing adoption.&lt;ref name=menachemi2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Menachemi N, Collum TH | title = Benefits and drawbacks of electronic health record systems | journal = Risk Management and Healthcare Policy | volume = 4 | pages = 47–55 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22312227 | pmc = 3270933 | doi = 10.2147/RMHP.S12985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 survey estimated a cost of $32,000 per physician in a 5-physician practice during the first 60 days of implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fleming NS, Culler SD, McCorkle R, Becker ER, Ballard DJ | title = The financial and nonfinancial costs of implementing electronic health records in primary care practices | journal = Health Affairs | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 481–9 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21383367 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.2010.0768 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One case study by Miller et al. (2005) of 14 small primary-care practices found that the average practice paid for the initial and ongoing costs within 2.5 years.&lt;ref name=miller2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller RH, West C, Brown TM, Sim I, Ganchoff C | title = The value of electronic health records in solo or small group practices | journal = Health Affairs | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 1127–37 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16162555 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.24.5.1127 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 cost-benefit analysis found that using EMRs for 5 years created a net benefit of $86,000 per provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang SJ, Middleton B, Prosser LA, Bardon CG, Spurr CD, Carchidi PJ, Kittler AF, Goldszer RC, Fairchild DG, Sussman AJ, Kuperman GJ, Bates DW | title = A cost-benefit analysis of electronic medical records in primary care | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 114 | issue = 5 | pages = 397–403 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12714130 | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9343(03)00057-3 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.649.8226 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some physicians are skeptical of the positive claims and believe the data is skewed by vendors and others with an interest in EHR implementation.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, estimated it achieved net savings of $5 million to $10 million per year following installation{{when|date=October 2016}} of a computerized physician order entry system that reduced serious medication errors by 55 percent. Another large hospital generated about $8.6 million in annual savings by replacing paper medical charts with EHRs for outpatients and about $2.8 million annually by establishing electronic access to laboratory results and reports.&lt;ref name="CALAO"&gt;{{cite web|title=A State Policy Approach: Promoting Health Information Technology in California|publisher=California Legislative Analyst Office|url=http://www.lao.ca.gov/2007/health_info_tech/health_info_tech_021307.aspx|date=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintenance costs can be high.&lt;ref name=menachemi2011/&gt; Miller et al. found the average estimated maintenance cost was $8500 per [[Full-time equivalent|FTE]] health-care provider per year.&lt;ref name=miller2005/&gt;

Furthermore, software technology advances at a rapid pace. Most software systems require frequent updates, often at a significant ongoing cost. Some types of software and operating systems require full-scale re-implementation periodically, which disrupts not only the budget but also workflow. Costs for upgrades and associated regression testing can be particularly high where the applications are governed by FDA regulations (e.g. Clinical Laboratory systems). Physicians desire modular upgrades and ability to continually customize, without large-scale reimplementation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

======Training costs======
Training of employees to use an EHR system is costly, just as for training in the use of any other hospital system. New employees, permanent or temporary, will also require training as they are hired.&lt;ref name="Parish"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Parish C | title = Edging towards a brave new IT world | journal = Nursing Standard | volume = 20 | issue = 27 | pages = 15–6 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16566331 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a substantial majority of healthcare providers train at a VA facility sometime during their career. With the widespread adoption of the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture ([[VistA]]) electronic health record system at all VA facilities, fewer recently-trained medical professionals will be inexperienced in electronic health record systems. Older practitioners who are less experienced in the use of electronic health record systems will retire over time.

=====Software quality and usability deficiencies=====
The [[Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society]], a very large U.S. health care IT industry trade group, observed that EMR adoption rates "have been slower than expected in the United States, especially in comparison to other industry sectors and other developed countries. A key reason, aside from initial costs and lost productivity during EMR implementation, is lack of efficiency and usability of EMRs currently available."&lt;ref name="himss1"&gt;Defining and Testing EMR Usability. ''Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, June 2009''.[http://www.himss.org/content/files/HIMSS_DefiningandTestingEMRUsability.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] of the [[Department of Commerce]] studied usability in 2011 and lists a number of specific issues that have been reported by health care workers. The U.S. military's EMR "AHLTA" was reported to have significant usability issues.&lt;ref name="usmedicine1"&gt;[http://www.usmedicine.com/articles/electronic-records-system-unreliable-difficult-to-use-service-officials-tell-congress.html ''U.S. Medicine – The Voice of Federal Medicine, May 2009.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Lack of semantic interoperability=====
In the United States, there are no standards for semantic interoperability of health care data; there are only syntactic standards. This means that while data may be packaged in a standard format (using the pipe notation of [[HL7]], or the bracket notation of [[XML]]), it lacks definition, or linkage to a common shared dictionary. The addition of layers of complex information models (such as the HL7 v3 RIM) does not resolve this fundamental issue.

As of 2018, [[Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources]] was a leading interoperability standard, and the [[Argonaut Project]] is a privately sponsored interoperability initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicaleconomics.com/ehr/interoperability-ehr-medical-mine|title=Interoperability in EHR: the medical mine|last=|first=|date=|website=Medical Economics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[Epic Systems]] announced Share Everywhere, which lets providers access medical information through a portal; their platform was described as "closed" in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR300/RR308/RAND_RR308.casestudies.pdf |title=Electronic Health Records |last1=Kobb |first1=Enesha |last2=Sauser |first2=Kori | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=RAND |year=2014 |access-date=March 7, 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160322113344/http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR300/RR308/RAND_RR308.casestudies.pdf |archive-date=March 22, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with competitors sponsoring the [[CommonWell Health Alliance]].&lt;ref name="mj"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/10/epic-systems-judith-faulkner-hitech-ehr-interoperability|title=EPIC FAIL.

The economics of sharing have been blamed for the lack of interoperability, as limited data sharing can help providers retain customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://catalyst.nejm.org/ehr-interoperability-blame-game/|title=Moving Past the EHR Interoperability Blame Game - NEJM Catalyst|date=2017-07-18|work=NEJM Catalyst|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Implementations====
In the United States, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) has the largest enterprise-wide health information system that includes an electronic medical record, known as the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture ([[VistA]]). A key component in VistA is their [[VistA imaging]] System which provides a comprehensive multimedia data from many specialties, including cardiology, radiology and orthopedics. A [[graphical user interface]] known as the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) allows health care providers to review and update a patient's electronic medical record at any of the VA's over 1,000 healthcare facilities. CPRS includes the ability to place orders, including medications, special procedures, X-rays, patient care nursing orders, diets, and laboratory tests.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The 2003 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) ensured that the VA and DoD would work together to establish a bidirectional exchange of reference quality medical images. Initially, demonstrations were only worked in El Paso, Texas, but capabilities have been expanded to six different locations of VA and DoD facilities. These facilities include VA [[polytrauma]] centers in Tampa and Richmond, Denver, North Chicago, Biloxi, and the National Capitol Area medical facilities. Radiological images such as CT scans, MRIs, and x-rays are being shared using the BHIE. Goals of the VA and DoD in the near future are to use several image sharing solutions (VistA Imaging and DoD Picture Archiving &amp; Communications System (PACS) solutions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NDAA Image Exchange|url=http://www1.va.gov/vadodhealthitsharing/page.cfm?pg=23|website=United States Department of Veterans Affairs|access-date=4 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024042950/http://www1.va.gov/vadodhealthitsharing/page.cfm?pg=23|archive-date=24 October 2009|date=3 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Electronic Health Records flow chart.jpg|thumb|right|Electronic health records flow chart]]

Clinical Data Repository/Health Data Repository (CDHR) is a database that allows for sharing of patient records, especially allergy and pharmaceutical information, between the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DoD) in the United States. The program shares data by translating the various vocabularies of the information being transmitted, allowing all of the VA facilities to access and interpret the patient records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHDR|url=http://www1.va.gov/vadodhealthitsharing/page.cfm?pg=9|website=United States Department of Veterans Affairs|access-date=4 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024045131/http://www1.va.gov/vadodhealthitsharing/page.cfm?pg=9|archive-date=24 October 2009|date=3 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Laboratory Data Sharing and Interoperability (LDSI) application is a new program being implemented to allow sharing at certain sites between the VA and DoD of "chemistry and hematology laboratory tests". Unlike the CHDR, the LDSI is currently limited in its scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LDSI|url=http://www1.va.gov/vadodhealthitsharing/page.cfm?pg=4|website=United States Department of Veterans Affairs|access-date=4 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024044210/http://www1.va.gov/vadodhealthitsharing/page.cfm?pg=4|archive-date=24 October 2009|date=3 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One attribute for the start of implementing EHRs in the States is the development of the [[Nationwide Health Information Network]] which is a work in progress and still being developed. This started with the North Carolina Healthcare Information and Communication Alliance founded in 1994 and who received funding from [[Department of Health and Human Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Traynor K | title = National health information network passes live test | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | volume = 65 | issue = 22 | pages = 2086–7 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18997131 | doi = 10.2146/news080090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Veterans Affairs and [[Kaiser Permanente]] has a pilot program to share health records between their systems VistA and [[Kaiser Permanente#KP HealthConnect|HealthConnect]], respectively.&lt;ref name=mearian&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mearian|first=Lucas| name-list-format = vanc |title=VA, Kaiser Permanente launch e-health records exchange|journal=Computerworld|date=6 January 2010|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9143199/VA_Kaiser_Permanente_launch_e_health_records_exchange|access-date=31 October 2011|issn=0010-4841}}&lt;/ref&gt; This software called 'CONNECT' uses [[Nationwide Health Information Network]] standards and governance to make sure that health information exchanges are compatible with other exchanges being set up throughout the country.

The US Indian Health Service uses an EHR similar to Vista called RPMS. VistA Imaging is also being used to integrate images and co-ordinate PACS into the EHR system. In Alaska, use of the EHR by the Kodiak Area Native Association has improved screening services and helped the organization reach all 21 clinical performance measures defined by the Indian Health Service as required by the [[Government Performance and Results Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/rural-practice-redesigns-care-processes-allow-multidisciplinary-teams-leverage-electronic |title=Rural Practice Redesigns Care Processes To Allow Multidisciplinary Teams To Leverage Electronic Health Record, Leading to Better Screening of Medically Underserved |date=2013-05-22 |access-date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy and confidentiality===
In the United States in 2011 there were 380 major data breaches involving 500 or more patients' records listed on the website kept by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) Office for Civil Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/breachnotificationrule/breachtool.html |title=Breaches Affecting 500 or More Individuals |publisher=Hhs.gov |access-date=4 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829050650/http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/breachnotificationrule/breachtool.html |archive-date=29 August 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; So far, from the first wall postings in September 2009 through the latest on 8 December 2012, there have been 18,059,831 "individuals affected," and even that massive number is an undercount of the breach problem. The civil rights office has not released the records of tens of thousands of breaches it has received under a federal reporting mandate on breaches affecting fewer than 500 patients per incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20111222/blogs02/312229963 |title=Year closes on a note of breach shame &amp;#124; IT Everything, the healthcare IT blog by Modern Healthcare's Joe Conn |publisher=Modernhealthcare.com |date=2011-12-22 |access-date=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy concerns in healthcare apply to both paper and electronic records. According to the ''Los Angeles Times'', roughly 150 people (from doctors and nurses to technicians and billing clerks) have access to at least part of a patient's records during a hospitalization, and 600,000 payers, providers and other entities that handle providers' billing data have some access also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Health &amp; Medicine |title=At risk of exposure: In the push for electronic medical records, concern is growing about how well privacy can be safeguarded |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=2006-06-26 |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/health/medicine/la-he-privacy26jun26,1,3180537.column?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |access-date=8 August 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516062144/http://www.latimes.com/features/health/medicine/la-he-privacy26jun26,1,3180537.column?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |archive-date=16 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent revelations of "secure" data breaches at centralized data repositories, in banking and other financial institutions, in the retail industry, and from [[government database]]s, have caused concern about storing electronic medical records in a central location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CNN.com |date=23 May 2006 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/05/22/vets.data/index.html |title=FBI seeks stolen personal data on 26 million vets |access-date=30 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Records that are exchanged over the Internet are subject to the same security concerns as any other type of data transaction over the Internet.

The [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)]] was passed in the US in 1996 to establish rules for access, authentications, storage and auditing, and transmittal of electronic medical records. This standard made restrictions for electronic records more stringent than those for paper records. However, there are concerns as to the adequacy of these standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | ssrn = 1547425 | first = Tim | last = Wafa | name-list-format = vanc | title = How the Lack of Prescriptive Technical Granularity in HIPAA Has Compromised Patient Privacy | journal = Northern Illinois University Law Review | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, information in electronic medical records is referred to as Protected Health Information (PHI) and its management is addressed under the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) as well as many local laws.&lt;ref&gt;US Code of Federal Regulations, Title45, Volume 1 (Revised 1 October 2005): [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/get-cfr.cgi?YEAR=current&amp;TITLE=45&amp;PART=164&amp;SECTION=501&amp;SUBPART=&amp;TYPE=TEXTPrivacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information (45CFR164.501)]. Retrieved 30 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The HIPAA protects a patient's information; the information that is protected under this act are: information doctors and nurses input into the electronic medical record, conversations between a doctor and a patient that may have been recorded, as well as billing information. Under this act there is a limit as to how much information can be disclosed, and as well as who can see a patient's information. Patients also get to have a copy of their records if they desire, and get notified if their information is ever to be shared with third parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Information Privacy|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/consumers/index.html|work=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|access-date=28 March 2013|date=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Covered entities may disclose protected health information to law enforcement officials for law enforcement purposes as required by law (including court orders, court-ordered warrants, subpoenas) and administrative requests; or to identify or locate a suspect, fugitive, material witness, or missing person.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/summary/index.html Summary of the HIPAA Privacy Rule]&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical and health care providers experienced 767 security breaches resulting in the compromised confidential health information of 23,625,933 patients during the period of 2006–2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.privacyrights.org/data-breach/new Privacy Rights Clearinghouse's Chronology of Data Security Breaches]&lt;/ref&gt;

One major issue that has risen on the privacy of the US network for electronic health records is the strategy to secure the privacy of [[patients]]. Former US president George W. Bush called for the creation of networks, but federal investigators report that there is no clear strategy to protect the privacy of patients as the promotions of the electronic medical records expands throughout the United States. In 2007, the Government Accountability Office reports that there is a "jumble of studies and vague policy statements but no overall strategy to ensure that privacy protections would be built into computer networks linking insurers, doctors, hospitals and other health care providers."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |last=Pear |first=Robert  | name-list-format = vanc |title=Warnings Over Privacy of U.S. Health Network |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=18 February 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/18/washington/18health.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The privacy threat posed by the interoperability of a national network is a key concern. One of the most vocal critics of EMRs, New York University Professor Jacob M. Appel, has claimed that the number of people who will need to have access to such a truly interoperable national system, which he estimates to be 12 million, will inevitable lead to breaches of privacy on a massive scale. Appel has written that while "hospitals keep careful tabs on who accesses the charts of VIP patients," they are powerless to act against "a meddlesome pharmacist in Alaska" who "looks up the urine toxicology on his daughter's fiance in Florida, to check if the fellow has a cocaine habit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | vauthors = Appel JM |title=Why shared medical database is wrong prescription |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |date=30 December 2008 |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/opinion/views/orl-opappel3008dec30,0,4065787.story }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a significant barrier for the adoption of an EHR. Accountability among all the parties that are involved in the processing of electronic transactions including the patient, physician office staff, and insurance companies, is the key to successful advancement of the EHR in the US Supporters of EHRs have argued that there needs to be a fundamental shift in "attitudes, awareness, habits, and capabilities in the areas of privacy and security" of individual's health records if adoption of an EHR is to occur.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nulan C | title = HIPAA—a real world perspective | journal = Radiology Management | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 29–37; quiz 38–40 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11302064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Wall Street Journal'', the DHHS takes no action on complaints under HIPAA, and medical records are disclosed under court orders in legal actions such as claims arising from automobile accidents. HIPAA has special restrictions on psychotherapy records, but psychotherapy records can also be disclosed without the client's knowledge or permission, according to the ''Journal''. For example, Patricia Galvin, a lawyer in San Francisco, saw a psychologist at Stanford Hospital &amp; Clinics after her fiance committed suicide. Her therapist had assured her that her records would be confidential. But after she applied for disability benefits, Stanford gave the insurer her therapy notes, and the insurer denied her benefits based on what Galvin claims was a misinterpretation of the notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116709136139859229 |first=Theo |last=Francis  | name-list-format = vanc |title=Spread of records stirs fears of privacy erosion |journal=The Wall Street Journal |date=28 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06362/749444-114.stm |title=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=1969-12-31 |access-date=4 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119153956/http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06362/749444-114.stm|archive-date=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the private sector, many companies are moving forward in the development, establishment and implementation of medical record banks and health information exchange.
By law, companies are required to follow all HIPAA standards and adopt the same information-handling practices that have been in effect for the federal government for years. This includes two ideas, standardized formatting of data electronically exchanged and federalization of security and privacy practices among the private sector.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
Private companies have promised to have "stringent privacy policies and procedures." If protection and security are not part of the systems developed, people will not trust the technology nor will they participate in it.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; There is also debate over ownership of data, where private companies tend to value and protect data rights, but the patients referenced in these records may not have knowledge that their information is being used for commercial purposes.

In 2013, reports based on documents released by [[Edward Snowden]] revealed that the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] had succeeded in breaking the encryption codes protecting electronic health records, among other databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-06/nsa-code-cracking-puts-google-yahoo-security-under-fire.html |first=Allan |last=Holmes  | name-list-format = vanc |title=NSA Code Cracking Puts Google, Yahoo Security Under Fire |date=6 September 2013 |access-date=14 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, 4.5 million health records were hacked at [[UCLA Medical Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/17/423893626/ucla-health-says-4-5m-may-be-affected-in-data-breach |title=UCLA Health Says 4.5M May Be Affected In Data Breach |publisher= npr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulatory compliance===
* [[Health Level 7]]
In the United States, reimbursement for many healthcare services is based upon the extent to which specific work by healthcare providers is documented in the patient's medical record.  Enforcement authorities in the United States have become concerned that functionality available in many electronic health records, especially copy-and-paste, may enable fraudulent claims for reimbursement.  The authorities are concerned that healthcare providers may easily use these systems to create documentation of medical care that did not actually occur.
These concerns came to the forefront in 2012, in a joint letter from the U.S. Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services to the American hospital community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modernhealthcare.com/Assets/pdf/CH82990924.PDF U.S.Department of Health &amp; Human Services and U.S. Departments of Justice Letter]&lt;/ref&gt;  The American Hospital Association responded, focusing on the need for clear guidance from the government regarding permissible and prohibited conduct using electronic health records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Rich | last = Umbdenstock | name-list-format = vanc | title = Letter addressed to Secretary Sebelius and Attorney General Holder | url = http://www.aha.org/advocacy-issues/letter/2012/121112-let-hhs-doj.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160312072607/http://www.aha.org/advocacy-issues/letter/2012/121112-let-hhs-doj.pdf | archive-date = 12 March 2016 | dead-url = yes | publisher = American Hospital Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a December 2013 audit report, the U.S. HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) issued an audit report reiterating that vulnerabilities continue to exist in the operation of electronic health records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Not all Recommended Fraud Safeguards have been Implemented in Hospital EHR Technology | first = Daniel R. | last = Levinson | name-list-format = vanc | date = December 2013 | url = http://www.modernhealthcare.com/assets/pdf/CH92135129.PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The OIG's 2014 Workplan indicates an enhanced focus on providers' use of electronic health records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = OIG's 2014 work plan steps up scrutiny of EHRs | first = Marla Durben | last = Hirsch | date = 1 February 2014 | url = http://www.fierceemr.com/story/oigs-2014-work-plan-steps-scrutiny-ehrs/2014-02-01 | work = Fierce Health Care }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical data breach==
The Security Rule, according to Health and Human Services (HHS), establishes a security framework for small practices as well as large institutions. All covered entities must have a written security plan. The HHS identifies three components as necessary for the security plan: administrative safeguards, physical safeguards, and technical safeguards.

However, medical and healthcare providers have experienced 767 security breaches resulting in the compromised confidential health information of 23,625,933 patients during the period of 2006–2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.privacyrights.org/data-breach/new Privacy Rights Clearinghouse's Chronology of Data Security Breaches involving Medical Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act]] requires safeguards to limit the number of people who have access to personal information. However, given the number of people who may have access to your information as part of the operations and business of the health care provider or plan, there is no realistic way to estimate the number of people who may come across your records.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs8a-hipaa.htm HIPAA Basics: Medical Privacy in the Electronic Age from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse www.privacyrights.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, law enforcement access is authorized under the act. In some cases, medical information may be disclosed without a warrant or court order.

===Breach notification===

The Security Rule that was adopted in 2005 did not require breach notification. However, notice might be required by state laws that apply to a variety of industries, including health care providers. In California, a law has been in place since 2003 requiring that a HIPAA covered organization's breach could have triggered a notice even though notice was not required by the HIPAA Security Rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stevens|first1=Gina | name-list-format = vanc |title=Data Security Breach Notification Laws|url=http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42475.pdf|website=Federation of American Scientists|access-date=30 September 2014|page=3|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1 January 2009, California residents are required to receive notice of a health information breach.

Federal law and regulations now provide rights to notice of a breach of health information. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act requires HHS and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to jointly study and report on privacy and data security of personal health information. HITECH also requires the agencies to issue breach notification rules that apply to HIPAA covered entities and Web-based vendors that store health information electronically.  The FTC has adopted rules regarding breach notification for internet-based vendors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-08-24/pdf/E9-20169.pdf Department of Health and Human Services Breach Notification for Unsecured Protected Health Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11763">'''[[Emergency medical services]] in the [[Netherlands]]''' is a system of pre hospital care provided by the [[government]] in partnership with private companies.

==Organization==
[[File:Ambulance 08116.JPG|thumb|331x331px|One of the currently used types of ambulance vehicles]]

===Land Ambulance===
Emergency medical service in the Netherlands is provided by a number of private carriers, operating under contract to the Dutch government.  The system consists of a number of private ambulance companies, each with its own designated service area within one of fifteen service delivery regions, and with standards of operation that are provided by the government contract.  All contracts stipulate that the contractor is required to meet all standards published for vehicles, equipment, training, and performance by the Dutch Ambulance Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nederlandsambulanceinstituut.nl/|title=Dutch Ambulane Institute website (in Dutch)|accessdate=2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All contracts for EMS in the Netherlands are sent to tender every four years, with the contract being awarded to the most successful applicants.  Netherlands law forbids EMS systems to earn any profit; any surplus revenue is required to be directed to additional improvements to the system, including training, equipment, and vehicles.  The Dutch system is a rare exception to the rule in Europe, in that it operates on a variation of the Anglo-American model of EMS care,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cooke MW, Bridge P, Wilson S |title=Variation in emergency ambulance dispatch in Western Europe|journal=The Scandinavian Journal of Trauma and Emergency Medicine|volume=9|issue=2|pages=57–66|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not on the Franco-German model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dick WF |title=Anglo-American vs. Franco-German emergency medical services system |journal=Prehosp Disaster Med |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=29–35; discussion 35–7 |year=2003 |pmid=14694898 |doi= 10.1017/s1049023x00000650|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the majority of European countries.

===Air Ambulance===
The government of the Netherlands contracts for [[Air medical services|air ambulance service]], which is provided by four [[helicopters]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umcg.nl/azg/nl/english/azg/ |title=University of Groningen Mobile Medical Team |accessdate=2008-09-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601034111/http://www.umcg.nl/azg/nl/english/azg/ |archivedate=2008-06-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which are in service around the clock. These helicopters are strategically located around the country to minimize [[response times]].  Air units may perform high-acuity inter-facility transfers, or may also respond to the location where an emergency is occurring, to assist with immediate care or facilitate rapid transport of high-acuity victims..  All air ambulance helicopters are staffed by both [[nurse]] and [[physicians]].  The primary role of the helicopters is the rapid delivery of the Mobile Medical Team, and transport of the patient by aircraft, while possible, is not the preferred outcome.  In some cases, particularly for response to offshore emergencies, the civilian air ambulance system is supplemented by the three helicopters of the Search and Rescue service of the [[Netherlands Coastguard]]; using assets provided by the [[Dutch Navy]] and [[Dutch Air Force]] services.  All of these helicopters are transport-capable. Some areas of Holland also receive emergency air ambulance service from helicopters or vehicles based in [[Belgium]] and [[Germany]], since these locations are beyond the normal flight range of the Dutch-owned aircraft.

==Standards==
[[File:Star of life2.svg|thumb|[[Star of Life]], depicted on every Dutch medical vehicle]]

===Training===
Since 1992, Dutch law has mandated at least one nurse on every ambulance in the country, at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ambulancezorgnederland.nl/publiek/english.htm |title=AmbulanceZorg Nederlands website (english) |accessdate=2008-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003070621/http://www.ambulancezorgnederland.nl/publiek/english.htm |archivedate=October 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nurses employed on ambulances have all completed the full training required for a [[registered nurse]] in the Netherlands, and have then completed additional training and certification in [[anaesthesia]], intensive care, [[cardiac care]], or [[emergency room]], to apply for an additional year of training to qualify as a Registered Ambulance Nurse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wulterkens D |title=EMS in the Netherlands: A Dutch Treat? |journal=Journal of Emergency Medical Services |pmid= |date=2005-12-06 |url=http://www.jems.com/news_and_articles/articles/EMS_in_The_Netherlands.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204155303/http://jems.com/news_and_articles/articles/EMS_in_The_Netherlands.html |archivedate=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  All "paramedics" in the Netherlands are nurses.  The term ‘paramedic’ is not used in the Dutch system. As a result of this measure, all Dutch ambulances and rapid response vehicles are capable of providing [[Advanced Life Support]] (ALS) without online medical control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kuehl, Alexander |title=Prehospital systems and medical oversight |publisher=Kendall/Hunt Pub |location=Dubugue, Iowa |year=2002 |pages=91–92 |isbn=0-7872-7071-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exceptional level of training permits what is, for the most part, independent practice, conducted according to a set of National Emergency Care Protocols, issued by the Dutch Ambulance Institute, and reviewed and revised every four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ambulancezorgnederland.nl/publiek/english.htm |title=Ambulancezorg Nederlands website |accessdate=2008-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916011504/http://www.ambulancezorgnederland.nl/publiek/english.htm |archivedate=September 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical oversight for protocol compliance is conducted by each service's Medical Manager, who is a licensed physician.  On those occasions when the patient's condition actually exceeds the paramedic [[Medical guideline|protocols]], the paramedic has the option of either calling their own Medical Manager for additional instructions, or requesting the response of a mobile medical team.

===Staffing===
All ambulances are staffed by a crew of two.  These include one nurse, with the training and skill set described above, and one dedicated driver. The medical training of the driver is minimal, and that individual is minimal permitted to participate in patient care with assisting the nurse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wulterkens D |title=EMS in the Netherlands: A Dutch Treat? |journal=Journal of Emergency Medical Services |pmid= |date=2005-12-06 |url=http://www.jems.com/news_and_articles/articles/EMS_in_The_Netherlands.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204155303/http://jems.com/news_and_articles/articles/EMS_in_The_Netherlands.html |archivedate=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mobile medical teams (MMT) are generally staffed by a senior surgical resident or anesthesiologist with additional training to function in the prehospital environment and additional nurses.  MMT aircraft are designed for team delivery, not medical transport.  Transport is usually accomplished by means of the ambulance that originated the call, with the team on board.  In case of weather that restricts flight operations, each MMT is also equipped with a special van for land response.

===Vehicles===
[[Image:AmbuMotor.JPG|thumb|Dutch Paramedic Motorcycle]]
The Netherlands government mandates that all ambulances must meet the standards outlined by the Netherlands Ambulance Institute, in addition to the [[European standard]] [[CEN 1789]], as published by the European Committee for Standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cen.eu/cenorm/homepage.htm|title=European Committee for Standards website|accessdate=2008-09-19}},&lt;/ref&gt;  These standards are applied to the types of vehicles and the types of medical equipment required.  However, the Dutch system does not comply with all of the elements of the visual identity program beyond the basic colors of vehicles and warning systems, and has no plans to comply with the marking schemes standards.  In addition to conventional ambulances, in some areas, particularly those subject to urban traffic congestion, some Dutch paramedics also use ALS equipped motorcycles as Rapid Response Vehicles.

===Dispatch===
[[Image:Ambulance-public-600.png|thumb|Dutch EMS Dispatch Regions]]
All 25 EMS regions in the Netherlands are self-dispatching.  Some regions have more than one centre, but all are interconnected.  The technologies involved in the dispatch of EMS resources are generally equivalent to the American and British standards.  All EMS dispatch centers participate in the national emergency number scheme.  The [[emergency telephone number]] for ambulances in the Netherlands is [[112 (emergency telephone number)|112]]. All EMS calls in the Netherlands are nurse-triaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kuehl, Alexander |title=Prehospital systems and medical oversight |publisher=Kendall/Hunt Pub |location=Dubugue, Iowa |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-7872-7071-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Triage is conducted using national evidence-based triage protocols and guidelines developed by the Dutch Ambulance Institute. Most dispatch centers use computer-based decision-support systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Grol R, Giesen P, van Uden C |title=After-Hours Care In The United Kingdom, Denmark, And The Netherlands: New Models|journal=Health Affairs|year=2006 |volume=25|issue=6|pages=1733–1737|pmid= 17102200|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.25.6.1733|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/25/6/1733}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this approximately 30 percent of all requests for service are dealt with by some other means of service at the scene, and in approximately 40 percent of cases, the call is triaged with a result that an ambulance response is avoided entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J . Dib |author2=S . Naderi |author3=I . Sheridan |author4=K . Alagappan |title=Analysis and applicability of the Dutch EMS system into countries developing EMS systems|journal=Journal of Emergency Medicine|year=2006 |volume=30|issue=1|pages=111–115|pmid= 16434351|doi=10.1016/j.jemermed.2005.05.014|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0736467905003860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response time===
Dutch law provides support for all standards published by the Netherlands Ambulance Institute, which currently mandates that an ambulance must be in place on the scene of any emergency in the country within 15 minutes.  That standard is currently being met approximately 95 percent of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wulterkens D |title=EMS in the Netherlands: A Dutch Treat? |journal=Journal of Emergency Medical Services |pmid= |date=2005-12-06 |url=http://www.jems.com/news_and_articles/articles/EMS_in_The_Netherlands.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204155303/http://jems.com/news_and_articles/articles/EMS_in_The_Netherlands.html |archivedate=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5517">The use of [[açaí palm]] berries in supplements and the marketing of such supplements has led to enforcement efforts in the United States in 2010.  Advertisements of açaí berry supplements have been referred to as scams, both for their deceptive offers as well as for a lack of efficacy.  A [[Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre]] spokesman described the growing number of scams related to the sale of açaí berry supplements as "a major international problem."&lt;ref name="bell"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bell |first=Justin |title=Local woman suffering a bad scam |url= http://www.edmontonsun.com/news/edmonton/2010/03/28/13386671.html |accessdate=18 August 2010 |newspaper=Edmonton Sun |date=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
===Negative option billing===
Many makers of açaí berry supplements have offered their products on the Internet on a [[Negative option billing|negative option]] basis, meaning that customers automatically receive new shipments until they affirmatively cancel.  Such offers are often billed as "free trials," where users are asked to supply billing information to cover shipping and handling.&lt;ref name="ignelzi"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ignelzi |first=R. J. |title=Acai berry scam can leave a bitter taste in your mouth |url= http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2009/jul/10/1c11scamm143716-smartliving-acai-berry-scam/ |accessdate=18 August 2010 |newspaper=San Diego Union-Tribune|date=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many consumers fail to realize that, by giving their billing details, they have also agreed to accept recurring shipments, incurring monthly charges of $45 to $65&lt;ref name=johnson /&gt; or even $95.&lt;ref name=ignelzi /&gt;

==="Fake blog" affiliate marketing===
Common in the [[affiliate marketing]] of açaí berry supplements is the use of [[fake blog]]s, describing fictional testimonials of users of the product.&lt;ref name=ignelzi /&gt;&lt;ref name="shapley"&gt;{{cite news |last=Shapley |first=Dan |title=That Acai Berry Diet Is a Scam! And So Is That One...And That One...And... |url= http://www.thedailygreen.com/environmental-news/latest/acai-diet-scams-47032402 |work=The Daily Green |publisher=Good Housekeeping |accessdate=18 August 2010 |date=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that some fake blogs also alter the testimonials based on the user's location, deceiving the user into thinking that the supposed endorser is from the local area.&lt;ref name=johnson /&gt;

==Enforcement actions==
On 19 August 2009, [[Oprah Winfrey]] sued fifty Internet sellers of açaí berry supplements, including FWM Labs of [[Hollywood, Florida]]&lt;ref name="weintraub"&gt;{{cite news |last=Weintraub |first=Arlene |title=Oprah Winfrey Sues Resveratrol Seller |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/aug2009/db20090820_480635.htm?chan=rss_topStories_ssi_5 |accessdate=18 August 2010 |date=20 August 2009 |newspaper=Business Week |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230165101/http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/aug2009/db20090820_480635.htm?chan=rss_topStories_ssi_5 |archivedate=30 December 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[MonaVie]] of Salt Lake City, Utah.&lt;ref name=SLTOPrah&gt;{{cite news| title = Oprah sues Utah companies over false endorsements| author = Harvey, Tom |newspaper= [[Salt Lake Tribune]] |date=22 August 2009 |url= http://www.sltrib.com/ci_13179813?source=most_viewed |accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Eisenbarth]], a former contestant on ''[[The Biggest Loser]]'', later sued FWM in December 2009 for use of her image in FWM's advertisements.&lt;ref name="walsh"&gt;{{cite news |last=Walsh |first=James |title=Suit: Her (weight) loss should not be their gain |url=http://www.startribune.com/local/south/79586617.html?elr=KArks%3ADCiUHc3E7_V_nDaycUiD3aPc%3A_Yyc%3AaULPQL7PQLanchO7DiUr |accessdate=18 August 2010 |newspaper=Star Tribune |location=Minneapolis |date=17 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219015840/http://www.startribune.com/local/south/79586617.html?elr=KArks%3ADCiUHc3E7_V_nDaycUiD3aPc%3A_Yyc%3AaULPQL7PQLanchO7DiUr |archivedate=19 December 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, ABC's ''[[Nightline]]'' reported that FWM settled, resulting in payments of $200,000 in penalties and millions of dollars of refunds to consumers, as well as promises to refrain from deceptive advertising.&lt;ref name="kofman-shulman"&gt;{{cite news |last= Kofman |first=Jeffrey |title= Confusion Over Acai Does Not Mute Market |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/acai-miracle-berry-marketing-scam/story?id=10085901&amp;page=3 |work=Nightline |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=18 August 2010 |author2=Shulman, Scott |page=3 |date=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in August 2009, [[Illinois Attorney General]] [[Lisa Madigan]] filed suit against three local açaí berry supplement suppliers and an affiliate marketer.&lt;ref name=weintraub /&gt;

On 5 August 2010, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] sued Coast Nutraceuticals, Inc., a maker of açaí berry dietary supplements. The FTC cited false claims that the pills could cause weight loss or prevent cancer.&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Carla K. |title=FTC sues Ariz. company over acai pill free trials |url= https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iX7QelVKb-hGzkelfwtVsgXlFxgAD9HKRCSO2 |accessdate=18 August 2010 |agency=Associated Press |work=Google News |date=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Demonstration of pumping faecal sludge from a "wet" VIP pit (8152015980).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Fecal sludge from a [[pit latrine]] is pumped out to empty the pit ([[Durban]], South Africa)]]

'''Fecal sludge management''' ('''FSM''') (or '''faecal sludge management''' in [[British English]]) is the collection, transport, and treatment of fecal sludge from [[pit latrine]]s, [[septic tank]]s or other [[Sanitation#Onsite sanitation|onsite sanitation]] systems. Fecal sludge is a mixture of [[human excreta]], water and [[Municipal solid waste|solid wastes]] (e.g. [[toilet paper]] or other [[anal cleansing]] materials, [[Feminine hygiene|menstrual hygiene]] materials) that are disposed in pits, tanks or vaults of onsite sanitation systems. Fecal sludge that is removed from septic tanks is called '''septage'''. 

FSM is necessary in densely populated areas where a proportion of population is not connected to a [[sewerage|sewerage network]], and the covering and rebuilding pit latrines is not possible. This is the case in most urban areas of [[developing countries]], but such services are also used in developed countries where sewerage systems are unavailable. FSM services are usually provided by formal and informal private sector services providers, local governments, water authorities and [[Public utility|utilities]]. However, in many developing countries FSM services are often unavailable or if they are available are often informal, unregulated, unhygienic and unsafe. This can lead to [[Water pollution|surface water]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[groundwater pollution]], spreading of [[pathogen]]s into the environment and adverse [[public health]] impacts. It can also result in unreliable services with relatively high costs to the households which need them.

Fecal sludge collection services can be made available on a scheduled basis or on a call-for-service basis (also known as on-demand, on-request or non-scheduled services). The collected fecal sludge may be transported to treatment plants by using a [[vacuum truck]]; a tank and pump mounted on a flatbed truck; a small tank pulled by a motorcycle; or in containers on a hand cart. Mobile or permanent transfer stations can be used to improve the efficiency of fecal sludge transportation by transferring the waste to larger tankers for haulage to treatment. The wider use of multiple decentralized sludge treatment facilities within the city (to avoid long haulage distances) is currently being researched and piloted.

The collected fecal sludge should preferably be processed at dedicated fecal sludge treatment plants, instead of being co-treated with [[sewage]] in municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants, unless these are able to take the additional load, and facilities to separate liquids and solids are available.&lt;ref name="FSM book 9"&gt;Strande, L., Ronteltap, M., Brdjanovic, D. (eds.) (2014). [http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publikationen/faecal-sludge-management-fsm-book/ Faecal Sludge Management (FSM) book - Systems Approach for Implementation and Operation], Chapter 9. IWA Publishing, UK ({{ISBN|9781780404738}})&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of mechanized and non-mechanized processing technologies may be used, including [[constructed wetland]]s, [[anaerobic digestion]], and [[waste stabilization pond]]s. The treatment process can produce useful products such as treated [[effluent]] that can be used for [[irrigation]]. Another possibility is to use the treated fecal sludge after [[compost]]ing as a [[soil conditioner]] or for the production of [[biogas]], charcoal, [[biodiesel]], powdered industrial fuel and [[electricity]]. Historically, the term [[night soil]] was used for fecal sludge.&lt;ref name="Tilley" /&gt; {{TOC level|3}}

[[Image:Septage pump truck Highland Michigan.JPG|thumb|right|Vacuum truck to transport septage, [[Highland, Michigan]]]]
Fecal sludge management (FSM) requires safe and hygienic [[septic tank]] and [[pit latrine]] emptying services, along with the effective treatment of solids and liquids and the reuse of treated produce where possible.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Strande, L., Ronteltap, M., Brdjanovic, D. (eds.) (2014). [http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publikationen/faecal-sludge-management-fsm-book/ Faecal Sludge Management (FSM) book - Systems Approach for Implementation and Operation]. IWA Publishing, UK ({{ISBN|9781780404738}})&lt;/ref&gt; It may include a range of options including on-site and offsite treatment, and the dispersal or capture and further processing of the products of the treatment process into such as [[biogas]], [[compost]] and energy.

FSM is used synonymously with the term "septage management", but they are not the same. Septage is a specific type of fecal sludge: it is the partially digested fecal solids that accumulates in septic tanks. Fecal sludge from pit latrines may have a lower water content compared to septage and may contain more solid waste. 

Pit latrines generate fecal sludge, and these are sometimes classified as [[dry toilet]]s, although wet pits are also common, especially in Asia. However, other types of dry toilets - those that are designed to be easily emptied, without the addition of water - do not generate fecal sludge but dried [[Human feces|feces]] (in the case of [[urine-diverting dry toilet]]s) or [[compost]] (in the case of [[composting toilet]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s), for example. In the case of [[Arborloo]] toilets, nothing is ever extracted from the pit and, instead, the lightweight outhouse/superstructure is moved to another shallow hole and a tree is planted on top of the filled hole.

Collectively, the collection, transport, treatment and [[reuse of excreta]] constitute the "value chain" of fecal sludge management.

In India some government policy documents are using the term FSSM for "Fecal sludge and septage management".&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) and Urban Management Centre (UMC) (2018). [https://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/3221 Faecal Sludge and Septage Management: An Orientation Module]. National Institute of Urban Affairs, New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt;

===Septage===
{{Further|Septic tank}}
Septage or "septic tank sludge" is partially treated sludge that is accumulated and stored in a [[septic tank]] or similar [[onsite sewage facility]]. Septage is a by-product from the pretreatment of household wastewater ([[sewage]]) in a septic tank. After a few years of accumulation, septage is usually pumped out of a septic tank by a [[vacuum truck]]. Septic tanks are receiving [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] from [[Flush toilet|flush toilets]], as well as [[greywater]]. This means that septage only contains the kind of solid waste that can be flushed, such as [[toilet paper]]. Septage may also include "scum", which is material that floats at the top and contains fats, oil and grease as well as any floating solid waste.  

The term "septage" has been used in the United States since at least 1992.&lt;ref&gt;USAID (1992) [http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/30004NKA.pdf Guide to Septage Treatment and Disposal], United States Environmental Protection Agency, USA&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used in projects by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;AECOM International Development, Inc. and the Department of Water and Sanitation in Developing Countries (Sandec) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) (2010) [http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADS118.pdf A Rapid Assessment of Septage Management in Asia'','' Policies and Practies in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam]
&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition of septage is: "A historical term to define sludge removed from septic tanks."&lt;ref name="Tilley"&gt;Tilley, E., Ulrich, L., Lüthi, C., Reymond, Ph. and Zurbrügg, C. (2014). [http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies (2nd Revised Edition)]. Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

Septage waste is periodically removed (with a frequency depending on tank capacity, system efficiency, and usage level, but typically less often than annually) from the septic tanks by specialized vehicles known as vacuum truck. They pump the septage out of the tank, and transport it to a local [[Sewage treatment|sewage treatment plant]]. It could also be used by farmers for fertilizer, or stored in large septage waste storage facilities for later treatment or use on crops.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Worldwide there is an increasing interest and awareness of FSM issues, particularly in Africa and Asia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Oxfam (2016).

Such research is being carried out and funded by many organizations, and also at scale by the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Chowdhry, S., Koné, D. (2012). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1662 Business Analysis of Fecal Sludge Management: Emptying and Transportation Services in Africa and Asia] - Draft final report. Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

In many developing countries, fecal sludge is not properly managed. This may be due to a lack of mandated institutions and little awareness of the impact of poor sanitation; the lack of technical expertise and experience; inability to source funds for to purchase of vacuum trucks and treatment, or lack of knowledge required to be initiate and implement successful FSM programs. This can result in the poor performance of onsite sanitation facilities (OSSFs), septic tank and pit latrine overflows, unsafe emptying of pit latrines, and the dumping of untreated pathogenic fecal sludge into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;WIN-SA (2011).

=== Purposes ===
[[File:Desluding using proper PPE. Dumaguete Philippines.jpg|thumb|Desludging using proper [[personal protective equipment]] in Dumaguete, Philippines]]
[[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Goal 6]] of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] for (water and) sanitation has helped to increase awareness of the risks of poor sanitation management along the entire sanitation chain. It has provided a motivation to many countries, cities and organizations to improve the range of improved sanitation services available. Among these are FSM programs to:{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}  
* Improve the functioning of onsite sanitation systems and to reduce the potential for human contact with fecal-borne pathogens;
* Minimize odors and nuisances, and the uncontrolled discharge of organic matter from overflowing tanks or pits;
* Support the upgrading of onsite sanitation upgrading programs;
* Safeguard public health against indiscriminate disposal of collected fecal sludge;
* Derive agricultural and energy products, including soil conditioner from composting or co-composting and energy products such as biogas, charcoal pellets, industrial powdered fuel etc.
* Stimulate economic development, job creation and livelihood opportunities while addressing the issues of the social stigma and operator health and safety issues that continue to impact informal workers.

FSM programs can be drivers of [[sanitation]] improvement in different ways. They can encourage OSSF upgrades that reduce (or increase) the frequency of desludging and therefore the operational and environmental costs. They can also be drivers of economic development all along the sanitation value chain. This can include provision of materials and parts for new toilets and septic tanks; contractors and equipment installers; sludge collection personal including drivers and emptiers; treatment and reuse systems operators; and production and sale of the end-products of the sludge treatment process.

These products may include recycled water for agriculture and industry, soil conditioners, biogas, biodiesel or electricity. There are many pilot, demonstration and full-scale FSM programs now operating in Asia and Africa, but few that have demonstrated a sustained impact upon the value chain.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

=== Elements of successful programs ===
[[File:Desludging truck in action Nepal.jpg|thumb|Desludging truck ([[vacuum truck]]) in action in Nepal]]
FSM services can be provided as demand based (often called on-request, on-call, on-demand, ad-hoc or non-scheduled) or scheduled (also known as regular) desludging, or a combination of both. Under either mechanism, OSSFs are desludged on a periodic basis or when the household requests it or due to inspection by a competent authority indicates desludging is needed.

An analysis of 20 FSM Innovation Case Studies and research and advocacy of successful programs carried out by [[Oxfam]] Philippines has demonstrated that common elements for successful FSM programs include:&lt;ref name="blackett2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Well formulated and practical policy, rules and regulation: While these are essential they are almost useless, even counterproductive, on their own, and must be supported by complementary factors such as those below;
* Local leadership and clearly mandated and resourced institutions to manage services, even where actual services are delivered by the private sector;
* Partnerships between stakeholders contributes to developing services at scale, building community confidence and achieving sustainability;
* A sustained program of community engagement, marketing and awareness raising is as essential to FSM as sludge treatment – but is frequently under-valued, under-budgeted and sometimes abandoned after an initial period;
* Capacity-building for FSM service providers helps ensure that they can effectively meet all segments of demand and achieve long-term viability. This may include training in both technical matters and business management, and the facilitation of capital formation through grants, equipment leasing, loan guarantees and other financial instruments;
* Tariffs that are pro-poor and representative of operational costs for providing the service;
* Technology that is appropriate to the capacity to operate and maintain the system and the realities of the value chain.

=== Characteristics of fecal sludge ===
Fecal sludge (FS) is the [[human waste]], [[wastewater]], trash and debris that accumulates in [[pit latrine]]s and [[septic tank]]s or other onsite sanitation systems.&lt;ref name="tilley"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publications/compendium/|title=Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies|last2=Ulrich|first2=Lukas|last3=Lüthi|first3=Christoph|last4=Reymond|first4=Philippe|last5=Zurbrügg|first5=Chris|publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag)|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|edition=2nd|location=Duebendorf, Switzerland|last1=Tilley|first1=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fecal sludge is an offensive material that contains [[pathogen]]s, can generate odors and cause surface [[water pollution]], as well as [[groundwater pollution]]. Characteristics of fecal sludge may vary widely due to climate, toilet type, diet and other variables. Performing a waste characterization study to understand local conditions provides data that factors into treatment plant sizing, as well as estimating the value of the products that can be derived from the treatment process.

The main physico-chemical parameters commonly measured to characterize fecal sludge include:{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]], [[total suspended solids]], % solids, indication of sand, [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]], [[ammonium]], total nitrogen and total phosphorus, Fats, Oil and Grease (FOG), [[Sludge volume index|Sludge Volume Index]] (SVI), pH, [[alkalinity]].

System designers often use default values, such as 2,000&amp;nbsp;mg/l for BOD and 5,000&amp;nbsp;mg/l of TSS (which might be an average country-wide) in order to size the treatment system. If no such data exists, or if local conditions are not adequately reflected in assumed values, a waste characterization study can be conducted.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Relatively little data exists on [[pathogen]] content in fecal sludge. One study from rural Bangladesh determined 41 [[Helminths|helminth eggs]] per g of fecal sludge from pit latrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balasubramanya|first=Soumya|last2=Evans|first2=Barbara|last3=Ahmed|first3=Rizwan|last4=Habib|first4=Ahasan|last5=Asad|first5=N. S. M.|last6=Vuong|first6=Luan|last7=Rahman|first7=Mominur|last8=Hasan|first8=Mahmudul|last9=Dey|first9=Digbijoy|date=2016-09-01|title=Pump it up: making single-pit emptying safer in rural Bangladesh|url=http://washdev.iwaponline.com/content/6/3/456|journal=Journal of Water Sanitation and Hygiene for Development|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=456–464|doi=10.2166/washdev.2016.049|issn=2043-9083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of fecal sludge may be influenced by:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Methods, techniques and the skill levels of personnel conducting the desludging;
* The efficiency of the different types of equipment used in desludging;
* Seasonality - presence of groundwater or flood water that may infiltrate into tanks and dilute the contents;
* The last time the tank was desludged (age of fecal sludge).
More research into conducting waste characterization studies in developing countries is needed. For developed countries, more data is available.&lt;ref&gt;Bilhimer, D. (2001) [https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/publications/publications/0107007.pdf Washington State Septage Characterization Analysis], Washington State Department of Ecology, Solid Waste &amp; Financial Assistance Program&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current practice==

===Cities===
[[File:Desludging fleet Manila Water.jpg|thumb|Fleet of [[vacuum truck]]s used for desludging services by Manila Water in Manila, Philippines]]
FSM is a critical sanitation service in cities and towns in all countries where households use onsite sanitation systems.&lt;ref&gt;Peal, A., Evans, B., Blackett, I., Hawkins, P., Heymans, C. (2015). [http://Engaging%20the%20stakeholders%20early%20on%20will%20help%20the%20implements%20to%20craft%20programs%20that%20serve%20each%20socioeconomic%20sector%20of%20the%20society. A Review of Fecal Sludge Management in 12 Cities] - (Final Draft). World Bank - Water and Sanitation Program&lt;/ref&gt; Citywide FSM programs may utilize multiple or one treatment facility, use stationary and mobile transfer stations, and engage with micro, small and medium-sized enterprises that may conduct some or all of the services.&lt;ref name="blackett2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/2760|title=FSM Innovation Case Studies - Case Studies on the Business, Policy and Technology of Faecal Sludge Management|last=Blackett|first=I.|last2=Hawkins|first2=P.|publisher=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|year=2017|isbn=978-1-5136-2513-3|location=Seattle, USA|pages=4–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|99}} Programs may be phased in over time to accommodate growing demand.

===Peri urban areas===
Peri urban areas are often less densely populated than urban centers. Therefore they have more space and on-site sanitation systems can be effective for solid and liquid treatment. In most such peri-urban areas, it is less likely that they will be connected to a conventional centralized sanitary sewer system in the short or medium term. Therefore, these areas will rely on a mix of onsite-sanitation systems and services, decentralized wastewater management systems, or by condominial or [[simplified sewerage]] connected to decentralized or centralized treatment. In all of these situations, FSM is a necessary service to keep the sanitation systems functioning properly.

===Rural areas===
[[File:Passing the faecal sludge to the top of the pit latrine.jpg|thumb|Bad practice example: A worker removing fecal sludge out of the pit of a [[pit latrine]] without wearing any [[personal protective equipment]] (in a village in [[Burkina Faso]]). ]]
Rural areas with low population density may not need formal FSM services if the local practice is to cover and rebuild latrines when they fill up. However, this if is not possible, rural areas often lack treatment facilities within a reasonable (say 30 minutes drive) distance; are difficult for tankers to access and often have limited demand for emptying making transport and treatment uneconomic, and unaffordable for most people. Therefore options such as relocating latrines on-site, double (alternating) pit or [[Arborloo]] toilets could be considered. Also sharing decentralized FSM services and sludge treatment between nearby villages, or direct safe removal burial of waste could be considered and organized.

== Design considerations ==

===Selecting the operator of FSM services===

FSM services are usually provided by formal and informal private sector service providers, local governments, water authorities and [[Public utility|utilities]]. Water utilities with a high percentage of water connectivity (homes with piped water connections) are logical operators of FSM programs. If water is sold to customers through a tariff, an additional tariff to cover FSM services may be added. For larger cities, it is usually the water and sewerage service provider that will be the most appropriate operator.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Local governments may choose to provide services by using their own staff and resources for collection, transportation and treatment. This is often the case in smaller cities or municipalities where the water utility may not have a broad reach. In many cases, cooperation between the city government and the water utility may be strategically advantageous. Dumaguete City, Philippines is one example where the Water District (utility) and Local Government have joint ownership and responsibilities for the FSM program.&lt;ref&gt;City Septage Management Program a Galing Pook, Youtube video (2013): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDOnMPP-nIQ , City Planning and Devt. Office Dumaguete City, Philippines
&lt;/ref&gt; Organized larger scale FSM programs may be able to provide the service more cheaply and more hygienically than the independent private operators working on an ''ad hoc'' basis. Ensuring services are affordable is an important selling point when promoting the program to citizens and encouraging them to participate.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The local private sector is an important player in providing FSM services. In such cases, private sector contractors may work directly for households (under regulation) or bid on desludging contracts let by the city. The private sector can also provide services in operating and maintaining the treatment works, and in processing and selling the commodities resulting from the treatment process. San Fernando City, La Union, Philippines is an example of a local government that has contracted out the treatment facility construction and collection program to the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psa.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=128&amp;Itemid=81|title=USAID-Rotary San Fernando City Sewerage and Septage Management Project|last=|first=|date=21 October 2010|website=|publisher=USAID Philippine Sanitation Alliance|access-date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synergy with other programs ===
FSM is but one aspect of citywide sanitation that also includes: 
* [[Municipal solid waste]] management;
* Drainage and [[greywater]] management; 
* Wastewater collection and treatment including effluent overflows from on-site systems where soils based dispersal systems are insufficient to assimilate the volume; 
* Water safety; and
* Food safety.  
There are important synergies between many of these services and FSM, and investigating co-management opportunities can yield benefits. MSW can often be co-managed with fecal waste, especially when thermal treatment technologies are used. Food waste from restaurants and markets can be co-composted with fecal waste to produce a high value soils amendment. Fats, Oil and Grease (FOG) from commercial grease traps can be added to biodigesters to increase methane production, or used in conjunction with fecal sludge as a feedstock for biodiesel production.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Robbins, Owen George, Rachel Burton (2011) [http://www.rti.org/sites/default/files/resources/managing_fats_oil_and_grease_for_local_governments_in_india.pdf Developing Programs to Manage Fats, Oil, and Grease (FOG) for Local Governments in India], VthWorld Aqua Congress—New Delhi, India, November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water supply]] is also closely linked with FSM as it is often the water utility that will manage programs and their customers that will pay for services through tariffs.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

=== Scheduled desludging programs ===
In Southeast Asia, there is increasing interest in scheduled desludging programs as a means of providing services. Under this scheme, users pay monthly tariffs that are included with their water bill to cover the cost of services. The trucks move from neighborhood to neighborhood on a scheduled cycle. Truck operators are licensed and compensated based on the volume of waste delivered to the treatment plant, which serves as an incentive against illegal dumping. The concept was first introduced in the Philippines in 2010 and has been replicated there successfully.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Co-treatment at wastewater treatment plants ===
Co-treatment of septage at [[Wastewater treatment|wastewater treatment plants]] is the method of choice for cities where almost all households have access to [[sewerage]]. In those situations the volume of septage is small in comparison with that of wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.developmentbookshelf.com/doi/book/10.3362/9781780449869|title=Faecal Sludge and Septage Treatment|last=Tayler|first=Kevin|date=|publisher=Practical Action Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9781853399862|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.3362/9781780449869}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}

== Technology components and infrastructure ==

===Technology selection===
[[File:Training of enumerators for septage survey Nepal.jpg|thumb|Training of enumerators for a survey regarding fecal sludge management needs in Nepal]]
A formal process should be used for making an informed technology selection for the treatment of the fecal sludge.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is usually ''a'' collaborative process conducted by stakeholders, consultants, the operator and the future owner of the facility''.'' The process is based on a long term vision planning with stakeholders as part of citywide sanitation planning. The expected waste flows (volume), their strength, characteristics, and variability in each area need to be known. A formal and transparent process for developing appropriate plans and designs for wastewater and fecal sludge treatment plants will achieve local buy-in and ownership of technology decisions, which is critical for the long term success and sustainability of the program.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Collection vehicles and equipment===
{{Further|Vacuum truck}}
[[File:Fig.1. Gulper used to desludge tanks in eThekwini, South Africa.JPG|thumb|The "Gulper", a device for manual pumping of fecal sludge from pits used in eThekwini ([[Durban]]), South Africa.]]

If the fecal sludge is liquid enough, it is usually collected by using vacuum pumps or centrifugal style booster pumps. A variety of manual and motorized devices designed to excavate thick and viscous sludge and accumulated trash are also available in the market.

After sitting for years in septic tanks and pit latrines, the accumulated sludge becomes hardened and is very difficult to remove. It is still common that workers enter pits in order to desludge them, even though this practice is generally unsafe and undesirable (in India, this practice is called "[[manual scavenging]]"). A number of low-cost pumping systems exist to remove this hardened sludge hygienically from the ground surface, although many of them are still in the experimental stage (e.g. Excravator, Gulper, e-Vac).&lt;ref name="Still2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Still|first1=David|last2=Foxon|first2=Kitty|title=Tackling the challenges of full pit latrines : report to the Water Research Commission|date=2012|publisher=Water Research Commission|location=Gezina [South Africa]|isbn=9781431202935|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fecal sludge can also be treated inside the tank or pit as well, by use of the "in-pit lime stabilization process", which treats the waste before it is removed from the tank or pit. This methodology was first pioneered by iDE Cambodia in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;iDE Cambodia (2013) Treating waste with lime, Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDGefsKq8vM
&lt;/ref&gt; Once removed, it is transported to onsite or off site treatment and processing facilities.

Some advanced transfer stations and vacuum trucks can dewater fecal sludge to some extent, and this water may be placed in sewer lines to be treated in wastewater treatment plants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This allows more sludge to be dealt with more efficiently and may constitute one of the best cases of co-treatment of fecal sludge in wastewater treatment plants.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Transfer stations===
 
Transfer stations are intermediary drop off locations often used where treatment facilities are located too far away from population centers to make direct disposal feasible. In other locations, traffic concerns or local truck bans during daylight hours may make transfer stations feasible. In addition, municipalities where a significant percentage of homes cannot be accessed by tanker truck should utilize transfer stations. Transfer stations are used if:

* More than 5% of the homes are inaccessible by a vacuum truck;
* The treatment plant is too far away from the homes for transport in one haul to be practical;
* Trucks are not permitted on the streets during the day; or
* Heavy traffic during daylight hours impedes the movement of vacuum trucks.

==== Mobile transfer stations ====
Mobile transfer stations are nothing more than larger tanker trucks or trailers that are deployed along with small vacuum trucks and motorcycle or hand carts. The smaller vehicles discharge to the larger tanker, which then carries the collected sludge to the treatment plant. These work well in scheduled desludging business models.

==== Fixed transfer stations ====
Fixed transfer stations are dedicated facilities installed strategically throughout the municipality that serve as drop off locations for collected fecal sludge. They may include a receiving station with screens, a tank for holding the collected waste, trash storage containers, and wash down facilities. These may be more appropriate for FSM programs using the "call-for-service" business model.

While static transfer stations are fixed tanks, mobile transfer stations are simply tanker trucks or trailers that work alongside the SVVs and actually do the longer haul transferring of the waste from the community to the treatment plant. Mobile transfer stations work best for scheduled desludging programs where there are no traffic restrictions or truck bans, and a relatively large number of homes that are inaccessible to the larger vehicles.

===Treatment plants===
[[File:Sand drying bed for emergency septage treatment Oxfam Philippines.jpg|thumb|Drying bed for emergency fecal sludge treatment by [[Oxfam]] in the Philippines]]
[[File:Sand drying bed Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|Drying bed for fecal sludge in Bangladesh]]
Fecal Sludge is often processed through a series of treatment steps to first separate the liquids from the solids, and then treat both the liquid and solid trains while recovering as much of the energy or nutritive value as possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Common processes at fecal sludge treatment plants include:

* Fecal sludge reception - where the truck interfaces with the treatment plant and sludge is unloaded. 
* Preliminary treatment - to remove garbage, sand, grit, and FOG (fats, oil and grease);
* Primary treatment - simple separation by physical means, or separation with microbial digestion;
* Liquids treatment - for example by using [[constructed wetlands]], [[Stabilization pond|waste stabilization ponds]], [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic digesters]]; and 
* Solids processing - using the solids resulting from fecal sludge treatment for beneficial use where possible.

Constructed wetlands are gaining attention as a low-cost treatment technology that can be constructed in many instances using local materials and labor. For sites with enough land and a ready supply of gravel and sand, this technology offers low cost, scalability, and simple operation.&lt;ref&gt;Thammarat Koottatep, Chongrak Polprasert and Nguyen Thi Kim Oanh, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228581103_Design_considerations_of_constructed_wetlands_for_septage_treatment_at_the_AIT_pilot_plant Design considerations of constructed wetlands for septage treatment at the AIT pilot plant]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Drying beds ====
Simple sludge drying beds can be used, as they are a cheap and simple method to dry fecal sludge (they are also widely used to dry [[sewage sludge]]). Drainage water must be captured; drying beds are sometimes covered but usually left uncovered. 

Drying beds are typically composed of four layers consisting of gravel and sand. The first layer is coarse gravel that is 15 to 20 centimeters thick. Followed by fine gravel that is 10 centimeters thick. The third layer is sand that can be between 10 to 15 centimeters and serves as the filter between the sludge and gravel. Sludge dries up and water percolates to the first layer that is collected at the drainage pipe that is beneath all layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KsWLsxWZJk|title=Introduction to Faecal Sludge Management, Unplanted drying beds|last=Gold|first=Moritz|date=|website=youtube.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Emerging technologies ====
Emerging technologies for fecal sludge treatment include:&lt;ref name="Diener"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diener|first1=Stefan|last2=Semiyaga|first2=Swaib|last3=Niwagaba|first3=Charles B.|last4=Muspratt|first4=Ashley Murray|last5=Gning|first5=Jean Birane|last6=Mbéguéré|first6=Mbaye|last7=Ennin|first7=Joseph Effah|last8=Zurbrugg|first8=Christian|last9=Strande|first9=Linda|title=A value proposition: Resource recovery from faecal sludge—Can it be the driver for improved sanitation?|journal=Resources, Conservation and Recycling|date=July 2014|volume=88|pages=32–38|doi=10.1016/j.resconrec.2014.04.005|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Thermal processes which can achieve cost effectiveness by eliminating the need for separate processes. They convert the fecal sludge along with certain fractions of [[sewage sludge]] or municipal solid waste to produce energy or fuel by using certain [[sewage sludge treatment]] technologies.
* Biodiesel can be manufactured by using fats, oils and grease as feedstocks. Research by [[RTI International]] is being conducted to use fecal sludge for biodiesel production.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}  
* Electricity can be produced by thermal processes that burn fecal and solid waste together to maintain stable combustion and the heat is used to make steam that drives generators.

===Treatment products and reuse options===
[[File:Sludge pellets after LaDePa process (8151957937).jpg|thumb|Sludge pellets after processing (including heating, drying and pelletizing) in a LaDePa process, eThekwini Municipality (South Africa)]]

[[Compost]]ing is a process whereby organic matter is digested in the presence of oxygen with the byproduct of heat. For fecal sludge, the heat deactivates the pathogens while the digestion process breaks down the organic matter into a humus-like material that acts as a soils amendment, and nutrients that are broken down into a form that is more easily taken up by plants. Properly treated fecal sludge can be reused in agriculture (see also [[reuse of excreta]]).

Fecal sludge is rich in nitrogen. When they are mixed with materials that are rich in carbon, such as shredded crop wastes, the composting process can be maximized. Proper mixture to achieve a ratio of 20 to 1 to 30 to 1 of carbon to nitrogen is best.

[[Biogas]] is a byproduct of the anaerobic digestion process.

Treated effluent can be used for agricultural or landscape [[irrigation]].

These by-products have the potential to offset some of the costs of the program, thereby reducing tariffs for the public. However, value addition all the way to biogas, biodiesel and electricity is difficult to achieve in practice due to technological and operational challenges.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Costs and fees ==
FSM is considered an entry point for sanitation improvement programs that are led by local governments. Such programs may include tariffs or user fees, promotions campaigns to raise the willingness to pay for the service, and local ordinances that define the rules and regulations governing FSM. In the Philippines, tariffs around $1 USD per family per month are generally enough to achieve full cost recovery within a period of 3 to 7 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Promotional campaigns are used to raise the willingness to pay for services, and local procedures and ordinances provide additional incentives for compliance.

[[File:Kiwi (Actinidia chinensis) 1 Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|right|A still life photograph of [[Kiwifruit]] against a white background]]

'''Food photography''' is a [[still life photography]] genre used to create attractive [[still life]] photographs of [[food]]. It is a specialization of [[commercial photography]], the products of which are used in advertisements, magazines, packaging, menus or cookbooks. Professional food photography is a collaborative effort, usually involving an [[art director]], a [[photographer]], a food stylist, a [[Theatrical property|prop]] stylist and their assistants.&lt;ref&gt;Manna/Moss, Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In advertising, food photography is often – and sometimes controversially – used to exaggerate the attractiveness or size of the advertised food, notably [[fast food]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bhasin |first=Kim |title=Look At The Shocking Difference Between Fast Food Ads And Real Menu Items |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/fast-food-ads-vs-the-real-thing-2012-1?op=1 |publisher=businessinsider.com |accessdate=16 April 2013 |date=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changing trends==
For a long time, food photographs tended to be shot and composed in a manner similar to the way people were used to encountering their food: laid out on a table setting and shot from an overhead perspective, i.e., from the point of view of the eater.&lt;ref name="Manna, Introduction"&gt;Manna/Moss, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Author's note: Page numbers not available here due to the e-book format. --&gt;  Stylists accordingly arranged the food to appear good from above, with the items arranged flat on the plate and clearly separated from each other.&lt;ref name="Manna 4/4"&gt;Manna/Boss, Chapter 4, section "Food-Styling Trends".&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Still Life Photograph.jpg|thumb|299x299px|A still life photograph of a Chinese dish using the technique of selective focus.]]
Later, romantic lighting, shallower angles and more props came ''en vogue'',&lt;ref name="Manna, Introduction" /&gt; with extreme cases leading to the term "[[food porn]]". Most recently, the prevailing trend in Western commercial food photography is to present the food as simple, clean and naturally as possible and with little props, often using effects such as selective [[Focus (optics)|focus]], tilted plates, and extreme [[close-up]]s.&lt;ref name="Manna, Introduction" /&gt; This complements trends in professional cooking to make the food more visually interesting. For instance, the height of dishes tends to increase and their elements are often layered, which lends itself well to narrow-angled shots.&lt;ref name="Manna 4/4" /&gt;

==Food stylist==
[[File:Foodstyling.jpg|thumb|A dish being styled for photography]]
The role of the food stylist is to make the food look attractive in the finished photograph. The time and effort a stylist takes to carefully and artfully arrange the food, is the cause of differences between the way the stylist presents it and the way a home cook or chef may. Visual know-how is also a requirement, as is the knowledge of how to translate the perception of taste, aroma and appeal that one gets from an actual dish, to a two-dimensional photograph.

Food stylists have culinary training; some are professional [[chef]]s or have a background in [[home economics]].&lt;ref name="Manna 4/1"&gt;Manna/Boss, Chapter 4, section "What Is a Food Stylist?".&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to knowledge of [[nutrition]] and cooking techniques, food stylists must also be resourceful shoppers.&lt;ref name="Manna 4/1" /&gt; As creative professionals they envision the finished photograph and style the food accordingly.

==Setup==
[[File:Still Life Photography.jpg|thumb|right|Often, to highlight the product, only a piece of it is focused.]]
The process of food photography begins with the purchase of the food and ingredients. Only the most visually perfect foodstuffs are acceptable and multiple backup or test items are usually needed. As a result, purchase of the food and ingredients is a very time-consuming process.&lt;ref name="Bellingham 6"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  The best-looking of the purchased items is selected and marked as the  "hero", i.e., the item that will be featured in the photograph.&lt;ref name="Bellingham 8"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; During the setup and for test shoots, it is represented by a cardboard stand-in.&lt;ref name="Bellingham 4"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual photography can take place in a [[Photographic studio|studio]] under controlled lighting conditions, or under [[natural lighting|natural light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Yi Chen |title=10 Food Photography Tips to Make It Look Tasty |url=http://www.photoble.com/photography-tips-tricks/10-food-photography-tips-to-make-it-look-tasty |publisher=photoble.com |accessdate=16 April 2013 |date=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The light, background and setting is carefully prepared so as to present the food in as attractive a way as possible without distracting from it. The color and texture of the background is selected so as to effectively complement that of the food and to assist with its lighting.&lt;ref name="Bellingham 18"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Styled food is usually marked as inedible and discarded after the shoot, because it may have been handled or treated in ways that make it unsafe for consumption.&lt;ref name="Bellingham 3"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 3 and 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold beverages===
[[File:Ice cubes openphoto.jpg|thumb|right|A stack of artificial ice cubes, used in place of real ones in situations where they would melt.]]
To create the effect of a thin layer of [[condensation]] forming on the outside of glasses containing cold liquid, [[dulling spray]] may be applied,&lt;ref name="Bellingham 29"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; with paper or [[masking tape]] protecting the non-"frosted" areas. More pronounced condensation and [[dew]] drops are imitated by spraying the glass with [[corn syrup]] or [[glycerin]].&lt;ref name="Bellingham 33"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ice cube]]s used in shoots are made of [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]], so they do not move or melt during the shoot, which may take place under hot studio lighting.&lt;ref name="Bellingham 36"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Fresh-looking bubbles on the surface of drinks are created by applying a mixture of the drink and [[detergent]] to the surface with an eyedropper.&lt;ref name="Bellingham 41"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; White [[glue]] may be used in lieu of [[milk]],&lt;ref name="Bellingham 29"/&gt; and a mixture of brewed [[coffee]] and water instead of [[tea]].&lt;ref name="Bellingham 42"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salads===
[[Salad]]s in food photography are composed with a view to creating appealing textures, shapes and colors. To improve support and aid in composition, salad in a bowl is built around a smaller bowl placed inverted in the larger bowl.&lt;ref name="Bellingham 60"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Salad greens are kept fresh and crisp by misting them with cold water prior to composition.&lt;ref name="Bellingham 61"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salad dressing]] is not normally used, as it makes the salad slippery and difficult to style, but the appearance of dressing may be created by sprinkling herbs and spices over the wet salad, or mixing them in oil and applying it with a brush.&lt;ref name="Bellingham 62"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fruit salad]]s are particularly challenging to shoot because of the short time the fruit pieces, which are cut immediately prior to final photography, retain their appearance.&lt;ref name="Bellingham 65"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 65.&lt;/ref&gt; As only the outer layer of the salad is of interest, the concealed interior of the salad bowl may be filled by [[mashed potatoes]] or another mixture.&lt;ref name="Bellingham 68"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Thick or heavy dressings do not photograph well; they are usually thinned and applied by brush.&lt;ref name="Bellingham 69"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hamburgers and sandwiches===
[[File:NYC-Diner-Bacon-Cheeseburger.jpg|thumb|left|This cheeseburger's buns and toppings appear uneven in shape and position, making it look not as attractive as it could be.]]

[[Hamburger]] photography is challenging because the [[bun]]s dent easily and an assembled burger is quick to lose its visual appeal.&lt;ref name="Bellingham 88"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; When assembling the burger, the ingredients are held in place with toothpicks and the meaty interior of tomato slices is removed to avoid juice discoloring the ingredients.&lt;ref name="Bellingham 93"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The meat [[patty|patties]] are superficially cooked, the edges browned with a torch and the meat made to look more appetizing with a colorant.&lt;ref name="Bellingham 95"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The edges of melted cheese slices may be brushed with household cleaner to make them look freshly melted longer.&lt;ref name="Bellingham 98"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Condiments such as mayonnaise are applied to the edges with an applicator bottle.&lt;ref name="Bellingham 100"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Steam is normally used to suggest the burger is hot.

[[Sandwich]]es are assembled using similar techniques. Wet paper towels are used to prevent the bread from drying out. If a half sandwich is to be depicted, the bread and the components are individually sliced with scissors and assembled in place.&lt;ref name="Bellingham 108"&gt;Bellingham/Bybee, 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

They do not need water, pipes, ventilation or chemicals to work.
The function of freezing toilets is based on freezing. The contents freeze in a short time stopping bacteria from growing and keeping it odourless. Consequently, it doesn't need mixtures or other chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huussi.net/en/materials/dry-toilet-conferences/dry-toilet-conference-2012/full-papers/|title=Full papers - Käymäläseura Huussi|work=huussi.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freezing toilets can be moved, as they only need a plug to work. The machine consumes about 40 watts of electricity.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Freezing toilets were developed in [[Sweden]] in the 1970s, but now production is in [[Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/5898384/toilet-freezes-your-poop-to-keep-it-from-stinking|title=Toilet Freezes Your Poop To Keep It From Stinking|author=Mario Aguilar|work=Gizmodo|publisher=Gawker Media|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huussi.net/en/materials/literature/|title=Literature - Käymäläseura Huussi|work=huussi.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''HIV Prevention Trials Network''' (HPTN) is a worldwide collaborative clinical trials network that brings together investigators, ethicists, community and other partners to develop and test the safety and efficacy of interventions designed to prevent the acquisition and transmission of [[HIV]]. HPTN studies evaluate new HIV prevention interventions and strategies in populations and geographical regions that bear a disproportionate burden of infection. The HPTN is committed to the highest ethical standards for its clinical trials and recognizes the importance of community engagement in all phases of the research process.

The HPTN was established in 2000, building on the work of the HIV Network for Prevention Trials (HIVNET). HPTN’s Leadership and Operations Center (LOC) is based at [[FHI 360]], Durham, NC. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fhi360.org/projects/hiv-prevention-trials-network-hptn-leadership-and-operations-center "HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) Leadership and Operations Center"], FHI 360, Retrieved 1 November 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; Its Laboratory Center (LC) is at [[Johns Hopkins University]], Baltimore, MD and Statistical and Data Management Center (SDMC) is housed within the Statistical Center for HIV/AIDS Research and Prevention (SCHARP) at the [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]] in Seattle, Washington.

HPTN receives funding from three [[NIH]] institutes: the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]], the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] and the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]].

==Snapshot==
* More than 50 trials ongoing or completed
* 161,000+ study participants enrolled and evaluated
* Over 85 clinical research sites in 19 countries
* 300+ publications

==Mission statement==
The HPTN is dedicated to the discovery and development of new and innovative research strategies to reduce the acquisition and transmission of [[HIV]].

==Leadership==
The HPTN leadership group is a subset of the Executive Committee (EC). The EC includes investigators from the Clinical Trials Units (CTUs), the Leadership and Operations Center (LOC), the Statistical and Data Management Center (SDMC), the Laboratory Center (LC), Community representatives, [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) representatives, and other individuals with expertise in HPTN scientific research areas.

The EC, under the direction of HPTN Principal Investigators (PIs) Myron Cohen, MD, and Wafaa El-Sadr, MD, MPH, MPA, in conjunction with the NIH, sets the research priorities of the HPTN and directs its scientific agenda.

==Network groups and committees==
The HPTN is a global network of investigators from Clinical Trials Units (CTUs), Leadership and Operations Center (LOC) which includes recognized experts in [[HIV]] prevention, leadership partners from the network Laboratory Center (LC) and Statistical and Data Management Center (SDMC) and various working groups (WGs) and committees charged with the scientific management and operational support of the network.

The EC Chair recommends, and the full EC approves, chair(s) and membership of the HPTN committees. Committee members serve for the duration of the cooperative agreement, and chairs serve three-year terms unless otherwise specified. Terms of committee chairs may be extended with the approval of the EC Chair. In addition to the scientific committees and working groups, there are five key standing Network oversight and operations committees: Science Review Committee (SRC), Study Monitoring Committee (SMC), Manuscript Review Committee (MRC), Performance Evaluation Committee (PEC), and Policies and Procedures Group (PPG).

==Research agenda==
HPTN studies strive to prevent [[HIV]] infection through the use of [[antiretroviral drugs]] (antiretroviral therapy and pre-exposure prophylaxis); interventions for [[substance abuse]], particularly [[injection drug use]]; behavioral risk reduction interventions and structural interventions. 

HPTN research studies are developed by protocol teams that include CTU investigators and recognized experts in [[HIV]] prevention. As study protocols are developed, they undergo a rigorous intra- and extra-Network review process that ensures compliance with current ethical guidelines and regulatory procedures.

==Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) strategies==

'''Monoclonal Antibodies'''

The HPTN and the [[HIV Vaccine Trials Network]] (HVTN) are studying [[monoclonal antibodies]] (mAbs) that may protect people from [[HIV]] infection. These studies will guide the development of new ways to prevent [[HIV]].

==Integrated strategies==
* [https://www.hptn.org/research/studies/hptn078 HPTN 078] is a US-based research study designed to develop and determine the effectiveness of a combined [[HIV]] prevention strategy that includes a method to identify, recruit, and link [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) to [[HIV]] care and an intervention to help HIV-infected MSM achieve and maintain viral suppression (low level of [[HIV]] in the body). &lt;ref&gt;[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02663219 "Enhancing Recruitment, Linkage to Care and Treatment for HIV-Infected MSM in the United States"], ClinicalTrials.gov, Retrieved 1 November 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;
* [https://www.hptn.org/research/studies/hptn075 HPTN 075] was an observational study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of [[HIV]] prevention research among [[men who have sex with men]] and [[transgender women]] in three countries in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. Findings from the study showed participants were at an alarming risk for getting [[HIV]]. The incidence among study participants was substantially higher than the estimated incidence among heterosexual men and women in the general population in the same countries. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.news-medical.net/news/20181024/HPTN-075-study-shows-high-risk-of-HIV-infection-among-MSM-and-TGW-in-sub-Saharan-Africa.aspx  "HPTN 075 Study Shows High Risk of HIV Infection Among MSM and TGW in sub-Saharan Africa"], News Medical Life Sciences, Retrieved 1 November 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;

At 52 weeks from enrollment, participants in the intervention arm nearly doubled their antiretroviral therapy usage, viral suppression and medication-assisted treatment usage compared to the standard of care arm. Mortality was also reduced by more than half with the intervention. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/novel-intervention-halves-rate-death-among-people-living-hiv-who-inject-drugs "HPTN 074 Demonstrates Significant Benefits Among People Living with HIV Who Inject Drugs"], National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Newsroom, Retrieved 1 November 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;

The prevention interventions included universal voluntary [[HIV]] counseling and testing provided at household level, linkage of [[HIV]] infected individuals to care and early initiation of [[antiretroviral therapy]] (ART) for all those testing [[HIV]]-positive. The study was conducted in 21 communities in the Western Cape of [[South Africa]], and in [[Zambia]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01900977 "Population Effects of Antiretroviral Therapy to Reduce HIV Transmission (PopART)"], ClinicalTrials.gov, Retrieved 1 November 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholars program==
The HPTN Scholars Program seeks to provide scholar recipients with the knowledge, skills and connections to further their careers as independent investigators in the [[HIV]] prevention research field. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hptn.org/research/scholars "HPTN Scholars Program"], HPTN website, Retrieved 1 November 2018 &lt;/ref&gt; Domestic and international scientists from groups under-represented in HIV prevention research are encouraged to apply. Successful domestic investigator applicants will have received their terminal degree (MD, PhD, etc.). For international investigators, current MD, PhD, and MBChB students may apply, along with individuals who already graduated with their terminal degree. 

Scholars: 
# Develop a research project using data from a completed or ongoing HPTN [[HIV]] prevention study and complete their scholarship project within the program cycle
# Present the findings of their project at the HPTN Annual Meeting and submit a manuscript at the end of the scholarship cycle
# Become knowledgeable of the process of doing research in NIH-funded [[HIV]] networks, and have the opportunity to build their research networks within the context of the HPTN

Scholars are provided funding to cover a portion of their time (typically ~ 10-30%) and expenses including travel and research materials/supplies. Successful applicants will be funded for 18 months, subject to certain restrictions. The HPTN Scholars Program is funded through a supplement from the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] and the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/hptn-scholars "HPTN Scholars"], National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Retrieved 1 November 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Community program==
Community participation and engagement are critical in the conduct of scientific research.  There is mutual benefit to communities and researchers when both parties work together throughout the scientific research process. In the HPTN, community participation occurs throughout the network, community and site levels through various mechanisms that include representation on the Ethics Working Group, the Science Review Committee and protocol teams. &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.hptn.org/community/study-participation-information "Study Participation Information"], HPTN website, Retrieved 1 November 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

This article is about the '''history of clinical psychological services in Singapore'''. The Asian [[City-state|city state]] of Singapore is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious society of over 4 million people. Singapore is an island country made up of 63 islands, it is separated from Malaysia by the Straits of Johor to its north and from Indonesia's Riau Islands by the Singapore Strait to its south. Singapore is highly urbanised but almost half of the country is covered by greenery. This article outlines the roots, chronological contexts and growth of clinical psychology through the periods from the 1950s to the [[Millennium|new millennium]]. 

== Beginning of psychological service in Woodbridge Hospital &lt;ref&gt;Long, F.Y. (1987). Psychology in Singapore: its roots, contexts, and growth; in Blowers, G.H. &amp; Turtle, A.M. (eds), Psychology moving east: the status of western psychology in Asia and Oceania, Colorado: Westview Press, 223-248.&lt;/ref&gt;==

Unlike many countries where the growth of psychology stemmed from academia, psychology in Singapore probably owes its genesis to the [[Psychiatric hospital|lunatic asylum]]. After the British had re-established [[Colonialism|colonial rule]] in Singapore at the close of [[World War II]], the first known person to be appointed as a psychologist was V W Wilson, DSC, MA, Dip Ed.  Dr J Browne was Medical Superintendent (1950–1958) and he introduced many changes and improvements to Woodbridge Hospital, including the need for a psychological service. Wilson, an Australian, was appointed to the colonial Medical Service on 11 September 1956 on contract from [[United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]] to build up and incorporate a full psychological service within the mental health programme based at the Woodbridge Mental Hospital. The appointment of Wilson was in line with the policy of the time when key appointments were normally filled by British officers.

Just before Wilson's appointment, M K Wong, a graduate of [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve University]] (USA), commenced limited psychological functions as a "pupil psychologist" for a short period before leaving for further clinical training at the [[Institute of Psychiatry]], London.

Upon his engagement, Wilson established the basic framework for the development of a psychological service in four main areas:
# to provide psychological and clinical services in the medical, social welfare and educational fields;
# to plan a programme of basic psychological research into social and cultural influences;
# to organize formal courses in psychology for psychiatric nurses and other professional staff whose work brings them into contact with psychological problems; and
# to make available professional advice to Government bodies, for example, on selection and promotion methods.

From the outset, Wilson's framework for the establishment of a psychological service, although within the mental health programme, was quite far-reaching, covering medical, social welfare and educational fields as well as providing advisory services to government bodies. These became the platforms upon which psychological services were expanded and delivered to many government bodies and other organizations till the present time.

== Psychological services in the 1960s ==

Wilson's contract expired in December 1959, so Wong who returned home at that time, took over Wilson's functions under the Malayanization process during which national workers replaced colonial expatriates at about the time when Singapore gained internal self-government.  For about a decade, Wong (1959–1969) worked within the framework that Wilson had set by providing psychological services within Woodbridge Hospital as well as to the Department of Paediatrics in the [[Singapore General Hospital]], [[School Health Services]] and various voluntary and welfare organizations such as the [[Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore|Singapore Association for Retarded Children]], School for the Deaf, Singapore Association for the Blind, Singapore Children's Society.  Wong also conducted lectures to nurses and other student groups.

In March 1968, F Y Long was employed as the second psychologist. Long, who completed his clinical psychology training at [[University of Sydney|Sydney University]], added impetus to what Wong had earlier embarked upon.  [[Personality test]]ing, including the use of [[Projective test|projective techniques]], became part and parcel of psychological assessment. Hitherto the psychologists conducted mainly IQ testing.  Soon after, [[behaviour therapy]] was applied for the first time in Woodbridge Hospital on a case of stammering but psychologists were not accorded any therapeutic functions.  In May, psychological assessment was extended to the selection of renal patients for haemodialysis at the Renal Unit in the Singapore General Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Khoo, O.T., Lim, C.H., Chen, B., Fernandez, P., Lim, P., Ooi, B.S. &amp; Long, F.Y. (1973). Three years' experience of regular dialysis in Singapore. Annals of [[Académie Nationale de Médecine|Academy of Medicine]], 1: 13-25.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1968, Dr Ho Eng Siong (designated child psychiatrist) and Long commenced weekly child guidance clinic for cases from Gimson Boys' School and welfare homes. Following Wong's resignation in October 1969, Long continued to implement what his predecessors had established but focused more on clinical work at Woodbridge Hospital and services to SGH, TTSH and Prisons Department.

== Clinical Psychology in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;Long, F.Y. (1972). Note on psychological services in Singapore. Australian Psychologist, 7: 215-219.&lt;/ref&gt; ==

During the early 1970s, with the Child Guidance Clinic in full-time operation, demands for psychological help were heavy.&lt;ref&gt;Long, F.Y. &amp; Lee, M.M. (1973). Two years' experience of child guidance service in Singapore. Singapore [[Medical journal|Medical Journal]], 14: 34-36.&lt;/ref&gt; At the direction of the then Minister for Health, the late Mr Chua Sian Chin, a five-year projection for psychological services within the Ministry of Health was submitted in April 1970. Subsequently, several psychologists (David Oon, Lee Mee Mee, MC Foo and Lily Ng) were added to the staff at Woodbridge Hospital and Child Guidance Clinic.

Behaviour therapy became the psychologists' recognized role after 1971  when Professor S Rachman, a renowned pioneer in the field, convinced the psychiatrists at Woodrbdige Hospital of what the psychologists could contribute to the clinical management of psychiatric patients. A programme of [[token economy]] was successfully carried out in a chronic ward in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Long, F.Y., Phua, E.C. &amp; Tan, K.H. (1973).Token economy programme in Singapore. Nursing Journal of Singapore, 13: 103-109.&lt;/ref&gt; The psychologists with the other members of the psychiatric team were involved in rehabilitation projects in Woodbridge Hospital.  Psychology lectures for various groups of nurses at the School of Nursing in SGH, the WH School of [[Psychiatric and mental health nursing|Psychiatric Nursing]] as well as to students at the Department of [[Social work|Social Work]] &amp; Social Administration, [[National University of Singapore|University of Singapore]] were in high demand.

Since the beginning of 1970, psychological services were extended to the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Prisons Department. John Elliott was appointed the first psychologist in the Ministry of Social Affairs (later known as the Ministry of [[Community development|Community Development]]).  A few years later, Loh Yan Poh became the first psychologist serving full-time in the Prisons Department.

== Moving into the 1980s ==

In the 1980s, in addition to the psychiatric services at Woodbridge Hospital,&lt;ref&gt;Boey, K.W. &amp; Long, F.Y. (1987). Psychosocial and symptom characteristics of government [[Clinic|outpatient clinic]] attendees in Singapore, International Journal of [[Social psychiatry|Social Psychiatry]], 33: 316-324.&lt;/ref&gt;  requests for psychological assistance and inputs from various Government agencies were relentless.  The Ministry of [[Interior minister|Home Affairs]] commissioned psychological studies on [[secret society]] members and other [[Youth organization|youth groups]]. The Public Service Commission called on Woodbridge Hospital to provide psychological assessment on President's and Overseas Merit Scholarship candidates. The [[Singapore Police Force]] inducted two psychologists into their Hostage Negotiation teams as well as for other operational needs. The Prime Minister's Office also required psychological evaluation on political and other candidates earmarked for higher office.  In view of these demands, a number of psychologists (KC Ong, KW Boey, Alice Yeoh, KW Ong, TG Oh, CL Lim, June Wong, Viven Chua and Chew Yang Hee) were appointed at varying periods.  In 1984, the Department of Psychology was officially established as a centralised Psychological Service for the entire [[Civil service|Civil Service]] (except for the Ministry of Education which had its own scheme of service for educational psychologists) with the Ministry of Health as the Central Appointing Authority. FY Long was appointed Head of Department and [[de facto]] Chief Psychologist.
	
By the late 1980s a new lineup of psychologists (Lyn Chua, Elizabeth Pang, Lee Ming Shu, Teresa Foong, Vivienne Ng, Shirley Tan, Christopher Choo and Marina Yap) came into service and replaced those who had left. They were organized according to the Hospital's psychiatric units and clinics.  With the rapid expansion of services, the Department of Psychology at Woodbridge Hospital in effect had spawned psychological service units at various government ministries and agencies; with psychology service units established at the Ministry of Community Development (now Ministry of Community Development Youths and Sports), Prisons Department, Singapore Police Force, [[Public Service Commission (Singapore)|Public Service Commission]], School Health Services, [[Tan Tock Seng]] Hospital and Singapore General Hospital.

== 1990s: the golden years of psychological services ==

The 1990s could be said to be the golden decade for psychological service. In 1993 when Woodbridge Hospital moved its location to Buangkok Green as the Institute of Mental Health &amp; Woodbridge Hospital, the first appointed CEO, Dr Luisa Lee, lent strong support to the Psychology Department in conducting mental health education, [[smoking cessation]] and [[stress management]] workshops for the community. Neuropsychological testing, [[Cognitive therapy|cognitive behavioural therapy]], individual and [[Group therapy|group psychotherapy]] were widely used. Requirements for psychology lectures, talks and courses continued unabated.  Several new psychologists were recruited: Clare Yeo, Carolyn Kee, Yap Ang Keong, Janice Chua, Khoo Sue Ann, Matthew Woo, Joyce Leong, Lim Kok Kwang, Patricia Tan and Ong Li Min. The psychologists were deployed according to the revamped psychiatric departments, units, outpatient services, research and rehabilitation programmes.

In the aftermath of the Hotel New World disaster,&lt;ref&gt;Long, F.Y. &amp; Teo, S.H. (1992). Some observations of survivors' psychological reactions and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] in the Hotel New World Disaster, ''[[Singapore|Singapore, Singapore]] Psychologist'', 4: 3-19&lt;/ref&gt; the Ministry of Home Affairs enhanced the country's emergency planning to include the need for psychological support for victims of such incidents.  In July 1994, in conjunction with the Ministry of Health and other Government agencies, Home Affairs set up the National Emergency Behaviour [[Management system|Management System]] with FY Long as the Chief EBO and TG Oh as Deputy to provide leadership in the development of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Long, F.Y. (2001). Psychological support in civil emergencies: the National Emergency Behaviour Management System of Singapore, [[International Review of Psychiatry]], 13, 209 – 214.&lt;/ref&gt; The NEBMS was activated during the 1996 [[North–South Expressway (Singapore)|North-South Highway]] accident, the 1997 [[SilkAir]] MI 185 and 2000 [[Singapore Airlines Flight 006|SQ 006]] [[Aviation accidents and incidents|air disasters]].  Woodbridge Hospital played a key role in providing professional support in all three incidents as well as subsequent disasters like [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|the Asian tsunami]].

== 2000s: epilogue &amp;  prologue ==

With the restructuring of the Ministry of Health and corporatisation of the health services and public hospitals, including Woodbridge Hospital, the Psychological Service as a Government centralised scheme of service was disbanded in 2000.  It marks the close of an era of clinical psychological services in Singapore and opens a new chapter of opportunities and challenges for the next generation of psychologists in providing psychological help to those who need it. Several new officers: Andrea Lai, Lena Leong, Winifred, et al. joined the Department and together with their senior colleagues have received the torch to run the next lap in the history of psychological services at Woodridge Hospital. With the introduction of the National Mental Health Blueprint, community psychology became increasingly popular. The IMH community psychology teams for the Elderly (APCATS), Adults (CMHT) and for Children and Adolescents (REACH) provided education and mental healthcare in collaboration with community partners in the schools and homes of patients. REACH, in particular, did exceptionally well and won several awards. This included the National Medical Excellence Award. The rise of community mental health teams coincided with another sunrise for psychology in Singapore. Psychologists Gifford Chan, Jeffrey Ong, Rashidah Sulaiman, amongst others, were recruited and trained. from REACH, the mental health network for children in Singapore extended to Family Service Centres, Voluntary Welfare Organisations, Singapore Polyclinics and in all schools.

It is the subtype of [[mucopolysaccharidosis type I]] (MPS I) with intermediate severity. [[Hurler syndrome]] is the most severe form, while [[Scheie syndrome]] is the least severe form. All forms of MPS I are a spectrum of the same disease. Some clinicians consider the differences between Hurler, Hurler-Scheie, and Scheie syndromes to be arbitrary. Instead, they classify these patients as having "severe", "intermediate", or "attenuated" MPS type I.&lt;ref name=NINDS/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4321">'''Hypnodermatology''' is an informal label for the use of [[hypnosis]] in treating the skin conditions that fall between conventional medical [[dermatology]] and the mental health disciplines.

The use of hypnosis to provide relief for some skin conditions is based on observations that the severity of the disease may correlate with emotional issues. In addition, [[hypnotherapy]] has been used to suggest improvement on dermatological symptoms, such as chronic [[psoriasis]],&lt;ref name="Tausk"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Tausk |first1=F. |last2=Whitmore |first2=S.

Philip D.

Treatment of OCD and anxiety: A major focus of Abramowitz's research is the treatment of OCD. His work primarily addresses [[exposure and response prevention]] (ERP; a form of [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral therapy]] [CBT]) and he has conducted treatment outcome studies and meta-analytic reviews of this therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Exposure and ritual prevention for obsessive-compulsive disorder: Effects of intensive versus twice-weekly sessions.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-006X.71.2.394|journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|pages = 394–398|volume = 71|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/0022-006x.71.2.394|first = Jonathan S.|last = Abramowitz|first2 = Edna B.|last2 = Foa|first3 = Martin E.|last3 = Franklin|pmid=12699033|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Effectiveness of psychological and pharmacological treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder: A quantitative Review.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-006X.65.1.44|journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|pages = 44–52|volume = 65|issue = 1|doi = 10.1037/0022-006x.65.1.44|first = Jonathan S.|last = Abramowitz|pmid=9103733|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also investigated factors that predict good and poor outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Symptom Presentation and Outcome of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-006X.71.6.1049|journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|pages = 1049–1057|volume = 71|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/0022-006x.71.6.1049|first = Jonathan S.|last = Abramowitz|first2 = Martin E.|last2 = Franklin|first3 = Stefanie A.|last3 = Schwartz|first4 = Jami M.|last4 = Furr|pmid=14622080|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Effects of comorbid depression on response to treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005789400800283|journal = Behavior Therapy|date = 2000-01-01|pages = 517–528|volume = 31|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/S0005-7894(00)80028-3|first = Jonathan S.|last = Abramowitz|first2 = Martin E.|last2 = Franklin|first3 = Gordon P.|last3 = Street|first4 = Michael J.|last4 = Kozak|first5 = Edna B.|last5 = Foa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abramowitz has helped to develop an OCD treatment program combining ERP with [[Acceptance and commitment therapy|Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]] (ACT).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Exposure therapy for OCD from an acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) framework|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211364914001043|journal = Journal of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders|pages = 167–173|volume = 6|doi = 10.1016/j.jocrd.2014.12.007|first = Michael P.|last = Twohig|first2 = Jonathan S.|last2 = Abramowitz|first3 = Ellen J.|last3 = Bluett|first4 = Laura E.|last4 = Fabricant|first5 = Ryan J.|last5 = Jacoby|first6 = Kate L.|last6 = Morrison|first7 = Lillian|last7 = Reuman|first8 = Brooke M.|last8 = Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also helped to develop couple-based ERP programs for OCD and [[Body dysmorphic disorder|Body Dysmorphic Disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Treating Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder in Intimate Relationships: A Pilot Study of Couple-Based Cognitive-Behavior Therapy|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0005789413000129|journal = Behavior Therapy|pages = 395–407|volume = 44|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.beth.2013.02.005|first = Jonathan S.|last = Abramowitz|first2 = Donald H.|last2 = Baucom|first3 = Sara|last3 = Boeding|first4 = Michael G.|last4 = Wheaton|first5 = Nicole D.|last5 = Pukay-Martin|first6 = Laura E.|last6 = Fabricant|first7 = Christine|last7 = Paprocki|first8 = Melanie S.|last8 = Fischer|pmid=23768667|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abramowitz has written about, and is conducting research to better understand, how to enhance the outcome of [[exposure therapy]]/ERP by optimizing extinction learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Strategies for Improving Long-Term Outcomes in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Insights From Learning Theory|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S107772291300059X|journal = Cognitive and Behavioral Practice|date = 2014-02-01|pages = 20–31|volume = 21|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.cbpra.2013.06.004|first = Jonathan S.|last = Abramowitz|first2 = Joanna J.|last2 = Arch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The practice of exposure therapy%3A Relevance of cognitive-behavioral theory and extinction theory - Google Scholar|url = https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=The+practice+of+exposure+therapy%253A+Relevance+of+cognitive-behavioral+theory+and+extinction+theory&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%252C34|website = scholar.google.com|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacoby|first=Ryan J.|last2=Abramowitz|first2=Jonathan S.|title=Inhibitory learning approaches to exposure therapy: A critical review and translation to obsessive-compulsive disorder|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272735816300599|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=49|pages=28–40|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2016.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work is drawn from inhibitory learning models of exposure.

This is commonly caused by [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[drug]] and [[smoking]] abuse as well as lack of physical activity and unhealthy eating.  Diseases that impact on our lifestyle are heart disease, stroke, obesity and type II diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=38316|title=Lifestyle disease|website=MedicineNet|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[disease]]s that appear to increase in frequency as countries become more industrialized and people live longer can include [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[arthritis]], [[atherosclerosis]], [[asthma]], [[cancer]], [[chronic liver disease]] or [[cirrhosis]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[type 2 diabetes]], [[heart disease]], [[metabolic syndrome]], [[chronic renal failure]], [[osteoporosis]], [[stroke]], [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[obesity]] and [[vascular dementia]]. In the UK the death rate is four times higher from respiratory disease caused by an unhealthy lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=‘Lifestyle diseases’ lead to higher mortality rates|url=http://journals.rcni.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/pdfplus/10.7748/mhp2013.03.16.6.5.p10726|journal=Mental Health Practice|volume=16|issue=6|pages=5–5|doi=10.7748/mhp2013.03.16.6.5.p10726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of the disease ==
[[Diet (nutrition)|Diet]] and [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] are major factors thought to influence susceptibility to many diseases.

In many [[Western world|Western]] countries, people began to consume more meat, [[dairy products]], [[vegetable oils]], tobacco, sugary foods, [[Coca-Cola]], and [[alcoholic beverages]] during the latter half of the 20th century.  People also developed [[sedentary lifestyle]]s and greater rates of [[obesity]]. In 2014 11.2 million Australians were overweight or obese &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4364.0.55.001|title=Main Features - Key findings|last=Statistics|first=c=AU; o=Commonwealth of Australia; ou=Australian Bureau of|website=www.abs.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rates of [[colorectal cancer]], [[breast cancer]], [[prostate cancer]], [[endometrial cancer]] and [[lung cancer]] started increasing after this dietary change.

== Death statistics in Australia ==
In 2013 there were 147,678 deaths within Australia mostly from lifestyle diseases including smoking of tobacco, alcohol use and other drugs, violence and unhealthy weight have impacted on Australians' death rate. The leading cause of death of Australian males was heart disease with 11,016 deaths, followed by lung cancer with 4,995 deaths, and chronic pulmonary disease killing 3,572.   All these conditions were mainly attributed to smoking, alcohol abuse or unhealthy lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/male-health/health-status/|title=Health status (AIHW)|website=www.aihw.gov.au|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 [[coronary artery disease|coronary heart disease]] was the leading cause of death in 8,750 women, mainly as a result of their lifestyle. Dementia and Alzheimer disease came second,  affecting 7,277 females and thirdly, cerebrovascular disease, killing 6,368. These top three causes of deaths could be minimized through lifestyle changes within the Australian population.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/deaths/leading-causes-of-death/|title=Leading causes of death (AIHW)|website=www.aihw.gov.au|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death statistics in the United States==

In 1900, the top three causes of death in the United States were [[pneumonia]]/[[influenza]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[diarrhea]]/enteritis. [[Communicable disease]]s accounted for about 60 percent of all deaths. In 1900, [[heart disease]] and [[cancer]] were ranked number four and eight respectively.  Since the 1940s, the majority of deaths in the United States have resulted from heart disease, cancer, and other [[degenerative diseases]]. And, by the late 1990s, degenerative diseases accounted for more than 60 percent of all deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statab/lead1900_98.pdf National Center for Health Statistics, National Office of Vital Statistics, 1947] for the year 1900 (page 67), for the year 1938 (page 55).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifestyle diseases have their onset later in an individual's life; they appear to increase in frequency as countries become more industrialized and people live longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; 
was too short for degenerative diseases to occur, compared to a life expectancy at birth of 77.8 years in 2004. Also, [[survival rate|survivorship]] to the age of 50 was 58.5% in 1900, and 93.7% in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Prevention ==
[[Disease prevention|Prevention]] is remedies or activities that aim to reduce the likelihood of a disease or disorder affecting people. Lifestyle diseases are preventable for children if parents set them on the correct path, as early life decisions and influences can impact people later on in life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lifestyle diseases can be prevented through reduction in smoking of tobacco &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/australias-health/2014/preventing-ill-health/#t1|title=Preventing and treating ill health (AIHW)|website=www.aihw.gov.au|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Australian Government has started this by introducing plain packaging for all tobacco products and increasing the prices of tobacco production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/tobacco-prod-reg|title=Tobacco product regulation and disclosure|last=Ageing|first=Australian Government Department of Health and|website=health.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overweightness and obesity can be prevented through a well balanced lifestyle through healthy eating and exercise.  Prevention can come about by a person undertaking 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily or by doing 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aihw.gov.au/male-health/lifestyle-factors/|title=Lifestyle factors (AIHW)|website=aihw.gov.au|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of moderate exercise includes a brisk walk, swim, [[Cycling|bike ride]] or it can also be everyday life activities  like mowing the lawn or [[house cleaning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/physical_activity_intensity/en/|title=WHO {{!}} What is Moderate-intensity and Vigorous-intensity Physical Activity?|website=www.who.int|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, animals studies have suggested that early life exercise can reduce the risk of developing metabolic diseases in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falcão-Tebas|first=Filippe|last2=Kuang|first2=Jujiao|last3=Arceri|first3=Chelsea|last4=Kerris|first4=Jarrod P.|last5=Andrikopoulos|first5=Sofianos|last6=Marin|first6=Evelyn C.|last7=McConell|first7=Glenn K.|date=2018-11-08|title=Four weeks of exercise early in life reprograms adult skeletal muscle insulin resistance caused by paternal high fat diet|url=https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP276386|journal=The Journal of Physiology|language=en|doi=10.1113/jp276386|issn=0022-3751}}&lt;/ref&gt; All causes of lifestyle disease can be prevented through giving up smoking and other drugs, reducing ones intake of alcohol, processed meats (like bacon and sausages), red meats (like pork, beef and lamb), fatty foods and by engaging in daily exercise.

The '''Lokka Reservoir''' (in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]: ''Lokan tekojärvi'', ''Lokan allas'', short form ''Lokka''), is a  [[reservoir]], upstream of the [[Luiro]] River in [[Sodankylä]], in northern [[Finland]]. Depending on the water level, its area ranges from 216 to 418&amp;nbsp;km². The corresponding water levels above mean sea level are 240&amp;ndash;245 meters. The filling of the reservoir Lokka began in 1967, and with this reservoir, the amount of water coming to the power plants in [[Kemijoki]] could be regulated. Lokka has also been famous for its rich fish population. There are also populations of [[white-tailed eagle]]s at the reservoir. These do not migrate south for the winter, instead they stay at Lokka to feed on fish left by local fishermen.

Lokka is connected to the [[Porttipahta Reservoir]] through the [[Vuotso Canal]].

Medical examination of the male [[genitals]] may be undertaken to detect various ailments, or to verify a person's age or biological [[sex]].

==Procedure==
For the male genital examination, the exposure of the [[groin]] and genital area with adequate lighting is required. The ideal position is with the professional sitting in front of the patient. The examination may take place with the patient sitting or in supine position, but to investigate possible [[varicocele]] and [[hernia]] it is necessary that the patient is standing in front of the examiner.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.portaleducacao.com.br/educacao/artigos/25102/exame-fisico-da-genitalia-masculina Physical Examination of Male Genitalia ]{{Pt icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a genital examination, the doctor can detect abnormalities such as [[phimosis]], [[Swelling (medical)|lumps]], [[tumors]], [[redness]], [[excoriation]], [[edema]], [[lesions]], [[swelling (medical)|swelling]], [[cancer]] and many others.

==Areas for inspection and palpation==
*[[Pubic]] region
*[[Penis]]
*[[Glans]]
*[[Scrotum]]
*[[Testicles]] and [[epididymis]]

==Other purposes==
Outside of the medical scope, there may also be social reasons for conducting genital examinations. For instance child refugees from [[Syria]] have had their genitals examined in some European countries in order to determine their age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Lee|title=Child refugees are being forced to take 'genital tests' to prove their age|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/child-refugees-are-subjected-to-genital-examinations-to-prove-their-age-although-the-tests-may-not-a6692016.html|work=The Independent|date=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been proposals by some lawmakers to initiate genital inspections in [[bathroom]]s at schools in response to a debate over which bathrooms should be used by [[transgender]] or [[intersex]] students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mazza|first1=Ed|title=Creepy Virginia Toilet Proposal Could Require Genital Inspections|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/virginia-bathroom-law_us_5695e5f8e4b09dbb4bad46b7|work=The Huffington Post|date=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:March of Dimes.png|thumb|Previous logo]]
'''March of Dimes''' is a United States [[nonprofit organization]] that works to improve the health of mothers and babies to prevent birth defects, premature birth and infant mortality.&lt;ref name="March of Dimes"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us |url=http://www.marchofdimes.org/mission/history.aspx |publisher=March of Dimes Foundation |accessdate=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was founded by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1938, as the '''National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis''', to combat [[polio]]. The name "March of Dimes" was coined by [[Eddie Cantor]]. After funding [[Jonas Salk]]'s polio vaccine, the organization expanded its focus to the prevention of birth defects and infant mortality.  In 2005, as [[preterm birth]] emerged as the leading cause of death for children worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preterm Birth|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs363/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; research and prevention of premature birth became the organization's primary focus.&lt;ref name="Baby Talk: March of Dimes Rebrands"&gt;{{cite web|title=Baby Talk: March of Dimes Rebrands|url=http://www.adweek.com/aw/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003696985|publisher=Adweek|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
March of Dimes improves the health of mothers and babies through five programming areas: medical research, education of pregnant women, community programs, government advocacy, and support of pregnant women and mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Annual Report|url=http://www.marchofdimes.org/materials/2015-annual-report.pdf|publisher=March of Dimes Foundation|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization provides women and families with educational resources on baby health, pregnancy, preconception and new motherhood, as well as supplying information and support to families in the [[Neonatal intensive care unit|NICU]] who are affected by prematurity, birth defects, or other infant health problems.&lt;ref name="Baby Talk: March of Dimes Rebrands"/&gt;

The organization began in 1938 as the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. In 1976 it became known as the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation. In 2007, the formal name became the March of Dimes Foundation.&lt;ref name="Baghdady Spring 2008 60–65"/&gt;

==Anti-polio efforts==

The group was founded by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on January 3, 1938, as a response to U.S. epidemics of [[polio]], a condition that can leave people with permanent physical disabilities. Roosevelt was himself diagnosed with polio in 1921, although [[Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness|his symptoms]] are now known to be more consistent with [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] – an autoimmune neuropathy which Roosevelt's doctors failed to consider as a diagnostic possibility.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Goldman | first1=Armond S. | last2=Goldman | first2=Daniel A. | date=2017 | title=Prisoners of Time: The Misdiagnosis of FDR's 1921 Illness | publisher=EHDP Press | isbn=978-1939824035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation was an alliance between scientists and volunteers, with volunteers raising money to support research and education efforts.&lt;ref name="Baghdady Spring 2008 60–65"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baghdady|first=Maddock J.|title=Marching to a Different Mission|journal=Stanford Social Innovation Review|year=Spring 2008|pages=60–65|url=http://www.ssireview.org/images/articles/2008SP_casestudy_baghdady_maddock.pdf|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis was a reconstitution of the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation, which Roosevelt and his friend [[Basil O'Connor]] founded with other friends in 1927.&lt;ref name="NYT Obit"&gt;{{cite news |last=Whitman |first=Alden |date=March 10, 1972 |title=Basil O'Connor, Polio Crusader, Dies|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E01E3DD1338EF3BBC4852DFB5668389669EDE |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location= |access-date=2015-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor became the foundation's president, a position he held for more than three decades. His first task was to create a network of local chapters that could raise money and deliver aid; more than 3,100 county chapters were established during his tenure.&lt;ref name="Baghdady Spring 2008 60–65"/&gt;

The name "March of Dimes" — a play on the contemporary [[The March of Time (radio program)|radio]] and newsreel series, ''[[The March of Time]]'' — was coined by stage, screen and radio star [[Eddie Cantor]].&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;Barrett, William P. "March of Dimes' Second Act". ''[[Forbes]]'', November 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maranzani"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/news/franklin-roosevelts-personal-polio-crusade |title=Franklin Roosevelt's Personal Polio Crusade, 75 Years Ago|last1=Maranzani |first1=Barbara |last2= |first2= |date=January 3, 2013 |website= |publisher=History.com |access-date=2015-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He inspired a nationwide fundraising campaign in the week preceding President Roosevelt's birthday on January 30, 1938. Lapel pins were sold for ten cents each; special features were produced by the motion picture studios and radio industry; and nightclubs and cabarets held dances and contributed a portion of the proceeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Three Home From Paralysis Session |newspaper=[[The Bakersfield Californian]] |location= |date=January 5, 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of people mailed cards and letters, each containing a dime, to the White House. Cantor's appeal collected more than $85,000 in what the press called "a silver tide which actually swamped the White House."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Star Cast to Take Air Tonight in Behalf of March of Dimes Drive  |newspaper=[[Abilene Reporter-News]] |location= |date=January 22, 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"During the past few days bags of mail have been coming, literally by the truck load, to the White House," Roosevelt said in birthday celebration broadcast January 30, 1938. "Yesterday between forty and fifty thousand letters came to the mail room of the [[White House]]. Today an even greater number — how many I cannot tell you — for we can only estimate the actual count by counting the mail bags. In all the envelopes are dimes and quarters and even dollar bills — gifts from grown-ups and children — mostly from children who want to help other children get well. … It is glorious to have one's birthday associated with a work like this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.disabilitymuseum.org/dhm/lib/detail.html?id=2155&amp;&amp;page=all |title=The President's Birthday Message|last=Roosevelt |first=Franlin D. |date=January 30, 1938 |website=Disability History Museum |publisher=National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis |access-date=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The March of Dimes was the title used for the foundation's annual fundraising event that requested each child donate a dime. At the Christmas season, booths were set up in cities where the children could drop their dime in a slot. These were out on the street and sometimes not even overseen by anyone.  Gradually the name became synonymous with that of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=William H. |last=Helfand|title='...So that others may walk': So be good. The March of Dimes.|year=2001|journal=American Journal of Public Health|page=1190|doi=10.2105/ajph.91.8.1190|pmc=1446742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"His genius was in generating large numbers of relatively small contributions for a cause," ''The New York Times'' wrote of O'Connor. "Over the years he collected and spent more than seven billion dimes — many of them from schoolchildren — with a half-billion dollars of it going to the war on polio."&lt;ref name="NYT Obit"/&gt;
[[File:Dime Obverse 13.png|right|100px]]
Publisher [[Gerard Piel]] credited O'Connor with a "unique social invention: a permanently self-sustaining source of funds for the support of research — the voluntary health organization." With a centralized administration, state and local chapters and a large corps of volunteers, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis became the prototype for dozens of similar foundations.&lt;ref name="NYT Obit"/&gt;

Because [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] founded the March of Dimes, a redesign of the [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]] was chosen to honor him after his death.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; The [[Dime (United States coin)#Franklin D. Roosevelt (1946–present)|Roosevelt dime]] was issued in 1946, on what would have been the president's 64th birthday.

From 1938 through the approval of the [[Jonas Salk|Salk]] [[Polio vaccine|vaccine]] in 1955, the foundation spent $233 million on polio patient care, which led to more than 80 percent of U.S. polio patients' receiving significant{{clarify|date=October 2011}} foundation aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oshinsky|first=David|title=Polio: an American Story|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-515294-8|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=October 2011}}

=== Sabin vaccine and conflict with the March of Dimes ===
Around the same time, [[Albert Sabin]] (also with funding from the March of Dimes) developed a simpler version of the vaccine, which was based on an [[Attenuated vaccine|attenuated live version]] of the polio virus.&lt;ref name="mitTechReviewSalkSabin"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/404390/the-myth-of-jonas-salk/ |title=The Myth of Jonas Salk |last=Matysiak |first=Angela |year=2005 |website=MIT Technology Review |publisher=MIT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larsen2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larsen|first1=Dawn|title=The March of Dimes and Polio|journal=American Journal of Health Education|volume=43|issue=1|year=2012|pages=47–54|issn=1932-5037|doi=10.1080/19325037.2012.10599217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Salk's version and Sabin's version had potential safety concerns; Salk's vaccine had the risk of a virus which is not completely inactivated, while Sabin's vaccine had the risk of reversion to virulence.&lt;ref name="Fabbri2016"&gt;{{cite book|first=Christiane |last=Nockels Fabbri|title=From Anesthesia to X-Rays: Innovations and Discoveries That Changed Medicine Forever: Innovations That Changed Medicine Forever|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PWhoDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA151|date=November 30, 2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-574-9|pages=150–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, a batch of Salk's vaccine made by Cutter Laboratories in California was inadequately inactivated and, as a result, 11 children died. After this incident, production methods were changed and no further incidents were reported. Sabin became highly critical of O'Connor and the March of Dimes, who he believed were biased towards Salk's vaccine and made statements inconsistent with the scientific research. In the meantime, trials of the vaccine based on Sabin's version were carried out in the Soviet Union with important contributions made by [[Mikhail Chumakov]]. In 1958, the Soviet Union organized industrial production of this vaccine and polio was largely eradicated in Eastern Europe and Japan. This success led to trials in the United States as well and the licensing of the Sabin's vaccine in 1961, over the considerable opposition of the March of Dimes, which supported Salk's vaccine. Eventually, Sabin's vaccine superseded Salk's vaccine based on its advantages, which included a simpler (oral) administration and lifelong immunity.&lt;ref name="Fabbri2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mitTechReviewSalkSabin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;

==Change of mission==
[[File:Salk March of Dimes poster.jpg|right|thumb|180px|March of Dimes polio poster (1957)]]
Following widespread use of the polio vaccine, the organization was faced with disbanding or steering its resources toward a new mission. Basil O'Connor, then the organization's president, directed his staff to identify strengths and weaknesses and reformulate its mission.&lt;ref name="Baghdady Spring 2008 60–65"/&gt; The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) shortened its name to the National Foundation (NF) in 1958 and launched its "Expanded Program" against birth defects, arthritis, and virus diseases, seeking to become a "flexible force" in the field of public health. In the mid-1960s, the organization focused its efforts on prevention of birth defects and infant mortality, which became its mission.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Michael.

''The Daily Gazette'' (Sterling, IL) 07 Apr. 2008: ''Newspaper Source Plus.'' Web. 21 Dec. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the cause of birth defects was unknown; only the effects were visible. In 1976, the organization changed its name to the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation.&lt;ref name="Baghdady Spring 2008 60–65"/&gt; Reducing the toll of premature birth was added as a mission objective in 2005.

===Maternal and neonatal care===
In 1976, the March of Dimes published a report titled ''Toward Improving the Outcome of Pregnancy'' (TIOP), and in 1993 they published ''Toward Improving the Outcome of Pregnancy: The 90s and Beyond'' (TIOP II).&lt;ref name="aappolicy.aappublications.org"&gt;{{cite journal|title=AAP Policy Statement: Levels of Neonatal Care|journal=Pediatrics|date=November 2004|volume=114|series=5|pages=1341–1347|url=http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;114/5/1341|accessdate=October 11, 2011|doi=10.1542/peds.2004-1697|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117230201/http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;114/5/1341|archive-date=November 17, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; TIOP "stratified maternal and neonatal care into 3 levels of complexity and recommended referral of high-risk patients to centers with the personnel and resources needed for their degree of risk and severity of illness."&lt;ref name="aappolicy.aappublications.org"/&gt; TIOP was published when "resources for the most complex care were relatively scarce and concentrated in academic medical centers."&lt;ref name="aappolicy.aappublications.org"/&gt; TIOP II updated care complexity designations from levels I, II and III to basic, specialty and subspecialty, and the criteria were expanded.&lt;ref name="aappolicy.aappublications.org"/&gt; In 2001, the March of Dimes introduced a family support program for those with babies in a [[neonatal intensive care unit]] (NICU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=March of Dimes Prematurity|url=http://www.marchofdimes.org/baby/the-nicu-family-support-program.aspx|work=March of Dimes Prematurity|accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program seeks to educate NICU staff to communicate effectively with patients' families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGann|first=E|title=Staff-Family Communications in the NICU: An Expert Interview with Liza Cooper|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/729514|publisher=Medscape Medical News|accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hospital Announces Partnership|url=http://cjonline.com/news/business/2009-11-03/hospital_announces_partnership|work=Topeka Capital Journal|accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The March of Dimes hosted the Symposium on Quality Improvement to Prevent Prematurity in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hikel|first=K|title=Preventing Prematurity: An Expert Interview With Alan R.

====Prematurity campaign====

Awareness about [[preterm birth]], which is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes, is an organizational goal. According to an editorial in the May 2004 issue of the ''Journal of the [[National Medical Association]]'', the original goals of the campaign were to raise awareness of the problem from 35 percent to at least 60 percent and to decrease the rate of premature births by at least 15 percent (from 11.9 percent to 10.1 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allen &amp; Green|title=March of Dimes Prematurity Campaign: A Call to Action|journal=J Natl Med Assoc|year=2004|volume=96|pages=686–688|pmc=2640653|pmid=15160986}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Prematurity Campaign was extended by the Board of Trustees until 2020, and global targets were set for prematurity prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Prematurity Campaign Report and Future Recommendations|journal=March of Dimes Foundation|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the March of Dimes started its annual Premature Birth Report Card, which grades the nation and each individual state on preterm birth rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Gets a 'D' for Preterm Birth Rates|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/womens-health/articles/2008/11/12/us-gets-a-d-for-preterm-birth-rates.html|accessdate=November 5, 2010|newspaper=U.S. News &amp; World Report|date=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Newborn screening====
March of Dimes states on its website that it supports mandated newborn screening of all babies in all states in the U.S. for at least 30 life-threatening conditions for which effective treatment and reliable testing are available to prevent catastrophic consequences to the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=March of Dimes Website|url=http://www.marchofdimes.org/professionals/newborn-screening-what-caregivers-need-to-know-online-course.aspx|accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bern|first=S|title=Expanding newborn screening: From advocacy to program implementation|url=http://apha.confex.com/apha/133am/techprogram/paper_104900.htm|work=American Public Health Association website|accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
    
In 2003, the March of Dimes began releasing an annual, state-by-state report card on each state's adoption of expanded newborn screening recommended by the [[American College of Medical Genetics]]. March of Dimes president [[Jennifer L. Howse]], Ph.D. has stated that this program is intended to inform parents of the tests available in their state, enabling those with affected babies to pursue early treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The March of Dimes Release Annual Report Card on Newborn Screening Program: A Newsmaker Interview with Jennifer Howse, PhD|journal=Medscape Medical News|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/508876|accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a presentation at the 2005 annual meeting of the American Public Health Association, individual, state-based March of Dimes chapters work with governors, state legislators, health departments, health professionals, and parents to improve state newborn screening programs and to make comprehensive newborn screening programs available to every newborn throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berns|first=S|title=Expanding newborn screening: From advocacy to program implementation|url=http://apha.confex.com/apha/133am/techprogram/paper_104900.htm|work=American Public Health Association|accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, only 38 percent of infants were born in states that required screening for 21 or more of 29 core conditions recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics; but by 2009, all 50 states and the [[District of Columbia]] required screening for 21 or more of these treatable disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Daily|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090218080936.htm|accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global Report on Birth Defects===
The March of Dimes published its Global Report on Birth Defects in 2006, which estimated birth defects' global burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laurence|first=J|title=Mediterranean Diet Reduces Birth Defects|journal=The Independent|date=31 January 2006|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/mediterranean-diet-reduces-birth-defects-525272.html|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===White paper on prematurity===
In 2009, the March of Dimes partnered with the Department of Reproductive Health and Research of the [[World Health Organization]] (RHR/WHO) to publish a white paper on the global and regional toll of preterm birth worldwide. This report, which was the first attempt to identify the global scope of premature births and related infant deaths, found that an estimated 13 million infants worldwide are born premature each year and more than one million of them die in their first month of life.  Further, premature births account for 9.6 percent of total births and for 28 percent of newborn deaths.  The highest rates of premature birth are in [[Africa]], followed by [[North America]] ([[Canada]] and the [[United States]] combined).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=1 Million "Preemie" Babies Die Each Year|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/womens-health/articles/2009/10/04/1-million-preemie-babies-die-each-year-report.html|accessdate=November 7, 2010|newspaper=U.S. News &amp; World Report|date=October 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the March of Dimes, March for Babies is held in more than 900 communities across the nation. Every year, 1 million people—including 20,000 company teams, family teams and national sponsors—participate in the event, which has raised more than $1.8 billion since 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=March for Babies|url=http://www.marchforbabies.org/|accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The March of Dimes states that seventy-six cents of every dollar raised in March for Babies is spent on research and programs to help prevent premature birth, birth defects and infant mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=March for Babies|url=http://www.marchforbabies.org/why.aspx|accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person to walk for the March of Dimes was [[John Harrison Finger]], a textile worker in [[High Point, North Carolina]]. In 1948, his daughter came home from school and asked for a donation for the polio fund. Finger replied that he did not have the money but that he would raise some. In what is thought to be the first [[walkathon]] in March of Dimes history, Finger walked 32 miles — round trip from High Point to [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] — and collected a total of $1,700 in a red wagon he pulled behind him. During his lifetime he walked more than 1,000 miles and raised $15,832 to benefit the charity. The March of Dimes formally created its nationwide [[March for Babies|WalkAmerica]] drive in 1971, and Finger was named "Mr. WalkAmerica" in 1983.&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sullivan |first=Meg |date=November 12, 1986 |title=March of Dimes Lets John Finger Do the Walking to Raise Money |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-11-12/news/vw-28971_1_dimes |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |location= |access-date=2015-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;{{cite news |last=Reade |first=Randy |date=December 23, 1989 |title=Obituary: John Harrison Finger, first walker to raise funds for March of Dimes |newspaper=[[Orange County Register]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sounds of Pertussis===
Once rare in the United States, cases of [[pertussis]] ([[whooping cough]]) are appearing across the country with greater frequency.&lt;ref name="Sounds"&gt;"'Sounds of Pertussis'" Campaign Makes Times Square Pit Stop." ''PR Newswire US'' 11 Aug. 2011: ''Newspaper Source Plus.'' Web. 21 Dec. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; To address this issue, the March of Dimes and Sanofi Pasteur launched a national education campaign in 2010 called "Sounds of Pertussis" to raise awareness about the seriousness of pertussis and the need for adult vaccination to prevent infecting babies.&lt;ref name="Sounds" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brady |first=S. |title=Health Care Salutes: Sounds of Pertussis Campaign |url=http://www.healthnews.com/family-health/child-health/health-care-salutes-sounds-of-pertussis-campaign-4497.html |publisher=Health News |accessdate=November 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031154139/http://www.healthnews.com/family-health/child-health/health-care-salutes-sounds-of-pertussis-campaign-4497.html |archivedate=October 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASCAR]] driver [[Jeff Gordon]] is a national spokesperson for the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sounds of Pertussis Campaign|url=http://www.wtvq.com/health/4570-sounds-of-pertussis-campaign-features-nascar-champ-jeff-gordon|accessdate=November 10, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227110214/http://wtvq.com/health/4570-sounds-of-pertussis-campaign-features-nascar-champ-jeff-gordon|archivedate=December 27, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign recently sponsored a song-writing contest called Sound Off About Pertussis, which was won by Maria Bennett with her original song, "Give Pertussis a Whooping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sound Off About Pertussis |url=https://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20101105-908720.html |publisher=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=November 5, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healthy Babies are Worth the Wait===
To combat the state's high prematurity levels, in 2007, the March of Dimes, the Johnson &amp; Johnson Pediatric Institute, and the Kentucky Department for Public Health partnered with six [[Kentucky]] hospitals to launch "Healthy Babies Are Worth the Wait," a health promotion and prematurity prevention initiative intended to reduce the rate of preventable preterm births in targeted areas of Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Healthy Babies are Worth the Wait®|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2TaqxqoYG0|accessdate=November 7, 2010|newspaper=WSAV|date=April 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rubin|first=R|title=Premature Birth Rate Drops 2nd Year in a Row, CDC Finds|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2010-05-12-preterm12_ST_N.htm|accessdate=November 7, 2010|newspaper=USA Today|date=May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kentucky was chosen as a pilot due to an elevated preterm birth rate greater than the national average that had been steadily increasing over the past few years, its predisposition to adjustable risk factors such as smoking and nutrition, and the commitment and dedication of community leaders. In 2007&amp;ndash;2009, the trial programs saw a 6.5% reduction in preterm birth rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/LHI/whosleading.aspx|title=Who’s Leading the Leading Health Indicators? - Healthy People 2020|website=www.healthypeople.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the program in the State of Kentucky led to the development of similar initiatives in New Jersey, Texas, New York, Kansas, and Illinois with upcoming sites in Florida and California.&lt;ref name="marchofdimes.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marchofdimes.org/professionals/healthy-babies-are-worth-the-wait.aspx|title=Healthy Babies are Worth the Wait|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary goal of Healthy Babies Are Worth the Wait is a 15 percent reduction in the rate of singleton (one baby) preterm births in these targeted areas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Service press release|date=27 March 2007|url=http://chfs.ky.gov/news/Healthy+Babies.htm|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; through increasing knowledge and education regarding factors that increase the risks of preterm birth, influencing change in health care settings and creating new advancements in preventing preterm and low-birth-weight births. Other strategic goals include improving access to prenatal services and lowering the rate of early elective deliveries done before 39 weeks gestation.&lt;ref name="marchofdimes.org"/&gt; The Healthy Babies are Worth the Wait initiative was developed based on five core concepts: Partnerships and collaborations, Provider initiatives, Patient support, Public engagement, and Progress measurement. The program encourages providers to educate patients on the risk factors and prevention methods for preterm births, inform women of childbearing age of the challenges of delivering prematurely, and distribute public information regarding the costs of prematurity on society ($26 million annually).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthy Babies are Worth the Wait®.

The program was implemented as a Best Practice in the Association of Maternal &amp; Child Health Programs (AMCHP) in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMCHP Innovation Station: Sharing Best Practices in Maternal &amp; Child Healthcare|url=http://www.amchp.org/programsandtopics/BestPractices/InnovationStation/ISDocs/HBWW_2015.pdf|website=AMCHP.org|publisher=Association of Maternal &amp; Child Health Programs|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perinatal Data Center===
The March of Dimes Perinatal Data Center includes the PeriStats Web site, which provides free access to U.S., state, county, and city maternal and infant health data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=J.|title=Medical Web Watch|journal=Southern Medical Journal|date=January 2008|volume=101|issue=1|pages=110|url=http://journals.lww.com/smajournalonline/fulltext/2008/01000/medical_webwatch.38.aspx|accessdate=November 5, 2010|doi=10.1097/SMJ.0b013e31815ba5aa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation supported==
*[[PREEMIE Reauthorization Act (S. 252; 113th Congress)]] – a bill that would reauthorize research by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] related to [[preterm birth]] and take other actions to improve infant mortality rates.&lt;ref name=marchofdimes1&gt;{{cite web|title=PREEMIE Reauthorization Act (S. 252/H.R. 541) |url=http://www.marchofdimes.org/advocacy/preemie-reauthorization-act.aspx |publisher=March of Dimes |accessdate=11 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903131017/http://www.marchofdimes.org/advocacy/preemie-reauthorization-act.aspx |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable staff==
[[Virginia Apgar]], M.D., the creator of the [[Apgar Score]], joined the March of Dimes in 1959 and eventually served as vice president for medical affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bio of Doctor Virginia Apgar, Changing The Face of Medicine Website|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_12.html|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==
Animal rights organizations have raised concerns about March of Dimes-funded medical research involving animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=March of Crimes: A website run by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|url=http://marchofcrimes.com/|accessdate=April 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation states it supports the use of non-animal research alternatives wherever possible.

In his book ''Essentials of Sociology: A Down-to-Earth Approach'', sociologist Professor James M. Henslin describes March of Dimes as a [[bureaucracy]] that has taken on a life of its own through a classic example of a process called goal displacement.  Faced with redundancy after Jonas Salk discovered the polio vaccine, it adopted a new mission, "fighting birth defects", which was recently changed to a vaguer goal of "breakthrough for babies", rather than disbanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wps.ablongman.com/ab_henslin_sociology_7/19/5062/1295985.cw/content/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927085017/http://wps.ablongman.com/ab_henslin_sociology_7/19/5062/1295985.cw/content/index.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Organizations: Management Without Control|last= Greenwald|first= Howard P.|year= 2007|publisher= Sage Publications, Inc.|location= |isbn= 1-4129-4247-0|pages= 369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charity Navigator]], an organization that attempts to quantify the effectiveness of charities, has given the organization a rating of two stars (out of four). This is a merged score that attributes both a Financial as well as Accountability &amp; Transparency rating to a non-profit. As of Fiscal Year 2015, Charity Navigator gives a 60.18 out of 100 score for Financial and a 97.00 out of 100 for Accountability &amp; Transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=4045|title=Charity Navigator Rating – March of Dimes|last=|first=|date=|format=|accessdate=2017-04-24|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives the March of Dimes a merged score of 71.76, leading to their two star status.

Another criticism has been that President Jennifer Howse's compensation is high. In 2011, the March of Dimes' tax filings reported it as $545,982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marchofdimes.org/materials/2011-form-990.pdf|title=March of Dimes 2011 990 Tax Filing, page 10|accessdate=2015-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the organization's filings from 2014 reported her salary as $503,692,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marchofdimes.org/materials/2014-form-990.pdf|title=March of Dimes 2014 990 Tax Filing, page 9|accessdate=2015-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 25% higher than the median CEO salary for similarly sized charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.charitynavigator.org/__asset__/studies/2012_CEO_Compensation_Study_Final.pdf|title= Charity Navigator 2012 CEO Compensation Study|date=November 2012|accessdate=2014-03-30 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Published by Educational and Industrial Test Services Ltd, T/A The Morrisby Organisation, the Morrisby Profile (MP) is a considerably revised version of the Morrisby Differential Test Battery, originally authored by John Morrisby. It consists of six ability tests, four [[personality psychology|personality]] measures and two [[manual dexterity]] measures. 

The six ability tests include: the Compound Series Test (CST); three General Ability Tests (GAT) (Verbal, Numerical and Perceptual); the Shapes Test and the Mechanical Ability Test. 

The four 'personality' measures are derived from four speed tests (which produce what is called the 'modal' profile). Two other speed tests are used to produce the 'dexterity' profile. 

The ability tests may be used separately and the whole battery may be used either in its entirety as a selection and development measure or linked with an [[Interest (in Psychology)|interest inventory]] and a computerised report to form the Morrisby Guidance Service (MGS). Although scores on the ability measures can be related to the general population through norms, vocational interpretations are based more strongly on the pattern of [[aptitude]]s shown. 

The [[British Psychological Society]]'s Psychological Testing Centre includes a summary&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychtesting.org.uk/test-registration-and-test-reviews/test-registration.cfm?page=summary&amp;Test_ID=54&lt;/ref&gt; and summary evaluation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychtesting.org.uk/test-registration-and-test-reviews/test-registration.cfm?page=evalsummary&amp;Test_ID=54&lt;/ref&gt; of the test.

'''Pediatric ophthalmology''' is a sub-speciality of [[ophthalmology]] concerned with [[eye disease]]s, visual development, and vision care in children.

==Training==
In the United States, pediatric ophthalmologists are [[physicians]] who have completed [[medical school]], a 1-year [[internship]], 3-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in ophthalmology, and a 1-2 year [[fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] in pediatric ophthalmology and [[strabismus]].  Pediatric ophthalmology fellowships in the United States are accredited by the [[American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus]].

==Clinical expertise==
Pediatric ophthalmologists focus on the development of the visual system and the various diseases that disrupt visual development in children.  Pediatric ophthalmologists also have expertise in managing the various ocular diseases that affect children.  Pediatric ophthalmologists are qualified to perform complex [[eye surgery]] as well as to manage children's eye problems using [[glasses]] and medications.  Many ophthalmologists and other physicians refer pediatric patients to a pediatric ophthalmologist for examination and management of ocular problems due to children's unique needs.  In addition to children with obvious vision problems, children with head turns, head tilts, squinting of the eyes, or preferred head postures ([[torticollis]]) are typically referred to a pediatric ophthalmologist for evaluation.  Pediatric ophthalmologists typically also manage adults with eye movement disorders (such as [[nystagmus]] or [[strabismus]]) due to their familiarity with strabismus conditions.

==Eye problems in children==
[[Image:EyeTestPoster.jpg|thumb|Public education poster urging eye exams for children ([[Works Progress Administration]], circa 1937)]]
Children experience a variety of eye problems, many quite distinct from adult eye diseases. Pediatric ophthalmologists are specially trained to manage the following disorders:
*Infections ([[Conjunctivitis]]).
*[[Strabismus]] is a misalignment of the eyes that affects 2-4% of the population; it is often associated with amblyopia. The inward turning gaze commonly referred to as "crossed-eyes" is an example of strabismus.  The term strabismus applies to other types of misalignments, including an upward, downward, or outward turning eye.
*[[Amblyopia]] (aka lazy eye) occurs when the vision of one eye is significantly better than the other eye, and the brain begins to rely on the better eye and ignore the weaker one.  Amblyopia affects 4% of the population and is clinically diagnosed when the [[refractive error]] of one eye is more than 1.5 diopters different from the other eye ([[anisometropia]]) or one of the eye is misaligned for a long period of time ([[Strabismus]]).  The management of amblyopia involves correcting of significant refractive errors and using techniques that encourage the brain to pay attention to the weaker eye such as patching the stronger eye(occlusion therapy).
*Blocked [[tear duct]]s.
*[[Ptosis (eyelid)|Ptosis]]
*[[Retinopathy of prematurity]]
*[[Nystagmus]]
*Visual inattention &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyedoctor.homestead.com/BabyEyes.html Your Baby's Eyes-Development, Vision Examination and Eye Problems Explained&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pediatric [[cataracts]]
*[[Pediatric glaucoma]]
*Abnormal vision development
*[[Genetic disorders]] often cause eye problems for affected children.  Since approximately 30% of genetic syndromes affect the eyes,  examination by a pediatric ophthalmologist can help with the diagnosis of genetic conditions.  Many pediatric ophthalmologists participate with multi-disciplinary medical teams that treat children with genetic syndromes.
*[[Congenital malformations]] affecting vision or the tear drainage duct system can be evaluated and possibly surgically corrected by a pediatric ophthalmologist.
*Orbital [[tumours]]
*Refractive errors such as [[myopia]] (near-sightedness), [[hyperopia]] (far-sightedness) and [[astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]] can often be corrected with prescriptions for glasses or contacts.
*[[Accommodative insufficiency]]
*[[Convergence insufficiency]] and [[asthenopia]]
*Evaluation of visual issues in education, including  [[dyslexia]] and [[attention deficit disorder]].

Pediatric ophthalmologists often work in conjunction with [[orthoptist]]s in the treatment of strabismus.

==History==
[[Frank D. Costenbader]] was an American [[physician]] frequently credited as the world's first pediatric ophthalmologist.&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;Marshall MM. [http://costenbadersociety.org/hist/csthst.pdf "The History of the Costenbader Society: Costenbader's Challenges."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927214659/http://costenbadersociety.org/hist/csthst.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }} March 19, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Costenbader and [[Marshall M. Parks]] (his mentee who would later be known to many as "the father of pediatric ophthalmology") began the first ophthalmology fellowship trained program of any subspecialty at the Children's Hospital in Washington, D.C., now known as the [[Children's National Medical Center]].&lt;ref name="Holley"&gt;Joe Holley. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/20/AR2005082001266.html "D.C. Physician Illuminated The Ailments of Young Eyes."] ''Washington Post''. Sunday, August 21, 2005; Page C11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://costenbadersociety.org/mmp/obit.pdf "Marshal M. Parks, M.D."] Obituary. Accessed September 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Parks trained many pediatric ophthalmologists during his career and was instrumental in the establishment of the [[American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus]], a national organization dedicated to improving the quality and management of pediatric ocular disease. Over time, over 30 programs were developed for the training of pediatric ophthalmologists throughout the United States.  The American Academy of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus works with the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] on issues related to pediatric eye disease and vision screening guidelines.

Other notable pediatric ophthalmologists have included: Jack Crawford, [[John T. Flynn]], [[David S. Friendly]], [[Eugene R. Folk]], [[David Guyton]], [[Robison D. Harley]], [[Eugene Helveston]], [[Arthur Jampolsky]], [[Barrie Jay]], [[Phillip Knapp]], [[Burton J. Kushner]],  [[Henry Metz]], [[Marilyn T. Miller]], [[John Pratt-Johnson]], [[Arthur Rosenbaum]], [[William E. Scott]], [[Gunter K. von Noorden]], and [[Mette Warburg]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4825">'''Primary health organisations''' ('''PHOs''') in [[New Zealand]],  are [[health care]] providers that are funded on a [[Capitation (healthcare)|capitation]] basis by the [[New Zealand Government]] via [[district health board]]s. They are usually set up as not-for-profit trusts, and have as their goal the improvement of their population's health.

==History==
In the early 1990s, [[general practitioner]]s (GPs) were joining together to form [[independent practice association|independent practitioner association]]s (IPAs). They did this to better negotiate with the purchasers of healthcare at that time.

Prior to the introduction of PHOs, general practitioners were paid using a [[fee-for-service]] model. For every person that went through their door, the GP received a set amount of money from the state. For some time, the Government had been trying to introduce a capitation model, that is, give practices a set amount of money depending on the population they served. The formation of the voluntary IPAs gave the Government an important stepping stone to introduce capitation-based funding. 

The Government introduced PHOs, which were similar to the IPAs, in 2001, with the first PHOs being formed in July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health. [http://www.moh.govt.nz/pho Primary health organisations (PHOs)]. Retrieved 16 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There were 81 PHOs by 2010 but some have since merged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Push to merge Primary Health Organisations |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/3292054/Push-to-merge-Primary-Health-Organisations |newspaper=Stuff |date=4 February 2010 |accessdate=16 January 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and goals==
A PHO is set up as a not-for-profit organisation with both community and provider representation. They maintain a list of their enrolled populations for which they get funding. PHOs include not just GPs and nurses, but also other health providers.

==Funding==
Primary health organisations are allocated funds depending on the characteristics of their enrolled population (this is called capitation).

The PHO receives a set amount of money from the [[district health board]] for every member, depending on their age, sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. They are also allocated funds for health promotion, individuals with special care requirements, as well as for rural practice.

Health care providers that are part of PHOs also have the right to charge fees to their patients for each visit. PHOs may also receive funding through contracting with the [[Ministry of Health (New Zealand)|Ministry of Health]], district health boards or other organisations such as [[Accident Compensation Corporation]] (ACC). Usually these contracts are to provide specific services or to pass on additional subsidies to target patient groups (over and above ordinary capitation subsidies).

This policy costs the Government more money to implement, and the expected proportion of each GP visit paid by the Government is higher than it has been previously. This means that generally New Zealanders can expect to pay less for a visit to the doctor.

==Perceived advantages==
;Benefits for individual patients
* Overall lower fees
* Wider range of services

;Benefits for the population as a whole
* Encouragement of rural practice
* Increased emphasis on preventative measures
* Services tailored to the needs of the communities PHOs serve

;Benefits for general practices
* Steady and predictable stream of income
* Better use of nurses (previously, a doctor had to see a patient for a practice to get paid by the Government)

'''''Race Against Time: Searching for Hope in AIDS-Ravaged Africa''''' is a non-fiction book written by [[Stephen Lewis]] for the [[Massey Lectures]]. Lewis wrote it in early to mid-2005 and [[House of Anansi Press]] released it as the lecture series began in October 2005. Each of the book's chapters was delivered as one lecture in a different Canadian city, beginning in Vancouver on October 18 and ending in Toronto on October 28. The speeches were aired on [[CBC Radio One]] between November 7 and 11. The author and orator, Stephen Lewis, was at that time the [[United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa]] and former [[Canadian ambassadors to the United Nations|Canadian ambassador to the United Nations]]. Although he wrote the book and lectures in his role as a concerned Canadian citizen, his criticism of the [[United Nations]] (UN), international organizations, and other diplomats, including naming specific people, was called undiplomatic and led several reviewers to speculate whether he would be removed from his UN position.

In the book and the lectures, Lewis argues that significant changes are required to meet the [[Millennium Development Goals]] in Africa by their 2015 deadline. Lewis explains the historical context of Africa since the 1980s, citing a succession of disastrous economic policies by [[international financial institutions]] that contributed to, rather than reduced, poverty. He connects the [[structural adjustment loan]]s, with [[Conditionality|conditions]] of limited public spending on health and education infrastructure, to the uncontrolled [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|spread of AIDS]] and subsequent food shortages as the disease infected much of the working-age population. Lewis also addresses such issues as discrimination against women and primary education for children. To help alleviate problems, he ends with potential solutions which mainly require increased funding by [[G8]] countries to levels beyond what they promise.

Book reviewers found the criticisms constructive and the writing sincere. His style focuses less on numbers and statistics, and more on connecting decisions by UN officials and western diplomats to consequences on the ground in Africa. His eyewitness accounts are said to be candid and emotional. The book spent seven weeks at #1 on ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'''s Nonfiction Bestseller List. A second edition was released in June 2006. The Canadian Booksellers Association awarded its Libris Award for non-fiction book of the year to ''Race Against Time'' and its Author of the Year Award to Lewis in 2006.

==Background==
At the time of publication, the author, [[Stephen Lewis]], aged 67 and living in Toronto, worked as the [[United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa]], a position he held since 2001.&lt;ref name=Valpy&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Valpy |authorlink= Michael Valpy |title=Stephen Lewis: An Envoy on the Brink of No Return |work=The Globe and Mail |date=October 22, 2005 |page=F4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously he worked as the Deputy Director of [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (1994–99), as the [[Canadian ambassadors to the United Nations|Canadian ambassador to the UN]] (1984–88), and as leader of the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]] (1970–79). After Lewis optimistically accepted the Special Envoy position he became increasingly distraught by the devastation he witnessed. Already a skilled orator, he became more vocal on the topic. He founded the Stephen Lewis Foundation, hosted [[Oprah Winfrey]] as she toured Africa, and was the subject of two award-winning documentaries by ''[[The Nature of Things]]'', entitled ''Race Against Time'' and ''The Value of Life''.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/show_raceagainsttime.html Race Against Time]".

[[David Suzuki]] (host), Judy Jackson (producer and director). ''[[The Nature of Things]]''. [[CBC Television|CBC]]. January 24, 2004. Retrieved on July 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile he was invested as a [[Companion of the Order of Canada]], awarded the [[Pearson Medal of Peace]], and named Canadian of the Year (2003) by ''[[MacLean's]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =Gatehouse |first=Jonathon |title = Crusade for Life |journal = Maclean's |volume =116 |issue =52 |issn=0024-9262 |pages = 20–21 |date= December 29, 2003}} (Reprinted at The Canadian Encyclopedia [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=M1ARTM0012546 Maclean's 2003 Canadian of the Year: Stephen Lewis.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607133207/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=M1ARTM0012546 |date=2011-06-07 }} Retrieved on July 18, 2008.)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, he was invited to deliver the annual series of [[Massey Lectures]] from which the book, ''Race Against Time'', was adapted. He wrote the text in early to mid- 2005 and delivered the lecture series in October when the book was released. Lewis wrote the book, not as an employee of the UN, but as a citizen concerned with the world's response to the AIDS challenge in Africa.&lt;ref name=LaFraniere/&gt;

==Content==
{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right |quote=&lt;div style="text-align:left;"&gt;What makes me nearly apoplectic—and I very much want to say this—is that the Bank and the Fund were fully told about their mistakes even as the mistakes were being made. It's so enraging that they refused to listen.&amp;nbsp;... The fact that poverty became increasingly entrenched, or that economies were not responding to the dogma as the dogma predicted, made no difference.&lt;/div&gt; |source=''Race Against Time'', page 16.}}
The book consists of five chapters, from which the five lectures were derived: Context, Pandemic, Education, Women, and Solutions.&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Lewis |title=Race Against Time: Searching for Hope in AIDS-Ravaged Africa |edition=2nd |format= |series=[[Massey Lectures]] |date=October 2005 |publisher=[[House of Anansi Press]] |location=Toronto |isbn=0-88784-733-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before these chapters are sections titled Preface and Acknowledgments, and afterwards a Glossary section. The book's second edition contains an Afterword section written in May 2006. In the Preface, written by Lewis in August 2005, he states that his preferred genre is the spoken word and that the nature of the topic would not allow him to comprehensively cover every aspect. He justifies his writing by proclaiming himself a devotee to the United Nations and outlines the roles he has held with the organization since 1984. In the first chapter, Lewis tells anecdotes of visits to Africa and other UN-related events like, in 1986, brokering the resolutions from the General Assembly's 13th Special Session. He acknowledges colonialism and Cold War ideologues as historical influences on the African situation, but focuses on the effects of [[Global financial system|international finance institutions']] [[Conditionality|conditional loans]] since the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, 1–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second chapter Lewis discusses his history in Africa, beginning in the 1960s as an English teacher in [[Ghana]]. He contrasts Africa of the 1960s shedding colonial rule, optimistic in future prospects, with Africa of the 2000s struggling with AIDS and increasingly widespread hunger.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, 37–70.&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledges the [[brain drain]] trend, noting "there are more [[Malawian]] doctors in [[Manchester]] [England] than in Malawi".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In the third chapter Lewis examines how the UN, [[World Bank]], and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) failed to fulfill promises of free access to [[primary education]]. In the instances where school entry fees were eliminated, additional fees (''e.g.'' fees for uniforms, books, exams, and registration) had the same effect of limiting access.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, 71–108.&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth chapter elaborates on how women's issues are ignored or dismissed at international conferences and by African governments. Lewis identifies the gender discrimination that occurs even within the UN organization, whose management staff was dominated by males. He links the World Bank and IMF conditions of low social spending on education and healthcare by governments of recipient countries to the rampant spread of AIDS in those same countries.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, 109–144.&lt;/ref&gt; The disease decimated Africa's working age and farming population, leading to famine. He calls on the international financial institutions to pay "[[Reparation (legal)|reparations]]" in the form of [[debt relief]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hamdan&gt;{{cite journal |last =Hamdan |first=Amani |title = Book Reviews: Race Against Time |journal = International Journal on World Peace |volume=24 |issue=2 |location =New York |issn = 0742-3640 |pages = 116–119 |date = June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---International Journal on World Peace article recaps the content, chapter-by-chapter---&gt;

Lewis concludes that dramatic changes are required to meet the [[Millennium Development Goals]] by 2015. In the final chapter, he considers some potential measures that could help in Africa. He laments the shortfalls in funding by [[G8]] countries, despite the continued renewed promises for full funding of Millennium Development Goal implementation. His proposed measures include:
# the expansion of the [[Jubilee 2000|Jubilee Coalition]] to include cancellation of [[agricultural subsidies]];
# the amalgamation of [[United Nations Development Fund for Women|UN Development Fund for Women]], the UN Division for the Advancement of Women, and relevant portions of [[United Nations Population Fund]] into one UN agency funded to a similar level as UNICEF;
# maintenance of the momentum on the [[World Health Organization]]'s 'three by five' (3&amp;nbsp;million people treated by 2005) program;
# addressing revenue shortfall in [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] through donations from private-sector organizations that profit from Africa (''e.g.'' [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]]);
# creating an agency that can provide emergency food aid in a much shorter timeframe than current programs;
# supporting [[Jeffrey Sachs]]' [[Millennium Village Project]];
# investing in vaccine and [[microbicide]] research;
# eliminating school fees for primary education;
# using [[microcredit]] money pots for women to care for orphans;
# planning for capacity replacement on a country-by-country, sector-by-sector basis.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, 145–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==

For example, he recounts tours of hospitals and schools as he explains the dire straits of national health and education sectors, and he describes meetings with diplomats and staff from the UN, World Bank, and IMF as he explains their effect on foreign aid policies.&lt;ref name=Langdon&gt;{{cite news |first=Steven |last=Langdon |authorlink= Steven W.

==Publication==
The book was released on October 18 as Lewis began the Massey lecture series in [[Vancouver]]. The second lecture took place in [[Winnipeg]] on the 20th, followed by [[Montreal]] on the 22nd, [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] on the 26th, and the final one in [[Toronto]] two days later. The series was recorded then aired on [[CBC Radio One]]'s [[Ideas (radio show)|''Ideas'']] between November 7 and 11.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/massey/massey2005.html Race Against Time]".

Retrieved on July 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; At each event Lewis fielded questions from the audience and participated in book signings.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |first= Bronwyn |last= Chester |title= Lewis gives Massey Lecture at McGill |work= McGill Reporter |location = Montreal |date= October 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher, [[House of Anansi Press]], was on the last year of its contract with CBC to publish the Massey Lecture series; facing a competitive bid from [[Penguin Books]], Anansi aggressively promoted ''Race Against Time'', with Lewis giving interviews to local media and attending receptions.&lt;ref name=Mandel&gt;{{cite journal |last = Mandel |first= Charles |date=November 2005 |title= Protecting the cornerstone: Massey Lectures series is Anansi's big seller, but contract is up |journal= Quill &amp; Quire |volume =71 |issue =11 |page =13 |location= Toronto |issn= 0033-6491}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBC promoted the events nationally. Following an initial printing of 25,000 copies of the book by Anansi,&lt;ref name=Mandel/&gt; along with the audio CDs produced by CBC Audio, there was a second printing in June 2006 with a new Afterword section.

An article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', in October 2005, reported on the book's criticism of South Africa's government, singling out President [[Thabo Mbeki]] and Health Minister [[Manto Tshabalala-Msimang]]. Lewis claimed that the South African programs were half-hearted and confusing; a spokesperson for the Health Ministry characterized Lewis as a biased and uninformed judge of South Africa's situation, and countered that they are rapidly expanding treatment programs.&lt;ref name=LaFraniere&gt;{{cite news |first=Sharon |last=LaFraniere |title=U.N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8770">'''Resonance frequency analysis''' ('''RFA''') is a method used to determine stability (the level of osseointegration) in [[dental implant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bilbao A et al. Assessment of dental implant stability in osseodistraction-generated bone: a resonance frequency analysis. Clin Oral Implants Res Apr 28 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Veltri M et al. Soft bone primary stability of 3 different miniscrews for orthodontic anchorage: a resonance frequency investigation. Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop. 2009 May;135(5):642-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The stability is presented as an [[implant stability quotient]] (ISQ) value. The higher the ISQ value the higher the stability.

Utilizing RFA involves sending magnetic pulses to a small metal rod temporarily attached to the implant. As the rod vibrates, the probe reads its resonance frequency and translates it into an ISQ value.

RFA measurements are used to assess the stability of the implant immediately after placement, as well as to measure the stability during the healing time. This helps the dentist determine if further healing time ([[osseointegration]]) is needed before the prosthetic tooth is attached, as well as to identify at-risk patients with compromised bone tissue, or other risk factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valderrama|first=Pilar|year=2007|title=Evaluation of Two Different Resonance Frequency Devices to Detect Implant Stability: A Clinical Trial|url=http://www.endoexperience.com/documents/rfaandisqarticlefrom2007periojournal.pdf|journal=Journal of Periodontology|volume=78|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Resonance frequency analysis was first suggested as an alternative method of analyzing peri-implant bone in a scientific paper by Meredith N et al in 1996.&lt;ref name="MeredithEtal"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meredith |first1=N. |last2=Alleyne |first2=D. |last3=Cawley |first3=P. |date=September 1996 |title=Quantitative determination of the stability of the implant-tissue interface using resonance frequency analysis |journal=Clinical Oral Implants Research |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=261–267 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0501.1996.070308.x |issn=0905-7161 |pmid=9151590}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated in the paper’s abstract, in measuring implant stability and [[osseointegration]], “radiographs are of value, but a standardised technique is necessary to ensure repeatability.”&lt;ref name="MeredithEtal" /&gt; The new technique tested involved connecting a small transducer (aluminum rod) to implants. Measurements showed that the resonance frequency increased in direct relation to the increase in the stiffness of the bone-implant interface,&lt;ref name="MeredithEtal" /&gt; thus demonstrating a repeatable and quantitative method of assessing stability.

The method underwent further research and in 1999 the Sweden-based company [[Osstell AB]] formed to commercialize the new technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.osstell.com/about/|title=About - Osstell – Implant Stability.|last=www.osstell.com|first=Osstell -|newspaper=Osstell – Implant Stability.|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osstell developed a device that transmitted vibrational frequencies to a metal peg inserted in the implant and measured the frequency at which resonance was reached. Whereas Meredith et al. measured in the range of 3500–8500&amp;nbsp;kHz, Osstell developed the [[Implant stability quotient|Implant Stability Quotient]] (ISQ) that translated this kHz range to a score 1–100.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2015|title=Assessment of implant stability by resonant frequency analysis|url=http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0042-8450/2015/0042-84501400063K.pdf|journal=Vojnosanit Pregl|volume=72|pages=169–174|via=|doi=10.2298/vsp130801063k}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resonance frequency analysis has considerable scientific interest since its advent, largely owing to the increasing number of patients demanding dental implants as the technology improves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dentalproductsreport.com/lab/article/continuing-evolution-implant-production|title=The continuing evolution of implant production|last=Group|first=Alexis Martino, Market Research Analyst, The Key|date=2012-03-21|website=staging.dentalproductsreport.advanstar.com|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it is a non-invasive and objective way to evaluate short- and long-term implant viability, RFA is an increasingly utilized method.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2016|title=Current trends to measure implant stability|url=http://www.j-ips.org/article.asp?issn=0972-4052;year=2016;volume=16;issue=2;spage=124;epage=130;aulast=Swami|journal=The Journal of Indian Prosthodontic Society|volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=124–130|doi=10.4103/0972-4052.176539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific foundations ==
The method that preceded RFA, [[Percussion (medicine)|percussion]] or “tapping,” may be used to understand the underlying functionality of RFA devices as the same principles are at work. When an implant was percussed with a blunt instrument, the nature of the sound elicited would qualitatively indicate the level of the implant’s stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2014|title=Measuring implant stability: A review of different methods|url=http://jdionline.org/article.asp?issn=0974-6781;year=2014;volume=4;issue=2;spage=165;epage=169;aulast=Mistry|journal=Journal of Dental Implants|volume=4|pages=165–169|via=|doi=10.4103/0974-6781.140891}}&lt;/ref&gt; A low pitched, dull sound (low frequency) indicated a loose bond with the bone, as the vibrations moved slower across the distance between the implant and surrounding tissue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  A high pitched, crystalline sound indicated a tight connection along the implant-bone interface, with vibrations moving quicker across a more restricted area. The dentist would make a qualitative assessment of the level of stability based on the sound heard.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2008|title=Implant stability measurements using resonance frequency analysis: biological and biomechanical aspects and clinical implications|url=http://implocerk.com/images/Sennerby%20Perio%202000,%202008.pdf|journal=Periodontology 2000|volume=47|pages=51–66|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0757.2008.00267.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With RFA, vibrations are being used to determine stability, but on a micro scale and in a non-invasive manner. A metal peg (transducer) with a magnet top is attached to the implant. Magnetic pulses (alternating sine waves of uniform amplitude) cause the peg to vibrate, increasing steadily in pitch until the implant resonates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Satwalekar|first=Parth|last2=Nalla|first2=Sandeep|last3=Reddy|first3=Ramaswamy|last4=Chowdary|first4=Sheeba Glory|date=2015-01-01|title=Clinical evaluation of osseointegration using resonance frequency analysis|journal=The Journal of the Indian Prosthodontic Society|volume=15|issue=3|pages=192–199|doi=10.4103/0972-4052.165171|issn=0972-4052|pmc=4762340|pmid=26929512}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher the resonant frequency, the more stable the implant.

== Measurement ==
The frequency readings, translated to an [[Implant stability quotient|Implant Stability Quotient]] (ISQ), are used as an assessment and ongoing monitoring tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Implant Dentistry - A Rapidly Evolving Practice|last=|first=|publisher=InTech|year=2011|isbn=978-953-307-658-4|location=|pages=111–126|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical interpretations of ISQ values may then be used to inform treatment plans, as analyzed and documented in hundreds of clinical studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.osstell.com/scientific-database/|title=Scientific Database - Osstell – Implant Stability.|last=www.osstell.com|first=Osstell -|newspaper=Osstell – Implant Stability.|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reading of 55 or below indicates that too much lateral movement is possible, and the implant needs to reach secondary stability (greater bonding with the bone) before the prosthesis may be attached.&lt;ref name="SuzukiEtal"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suzuki |first1=Senichi |last2=Kobayashi |first2=Hiroyuki |last3=Ogawa |first3=Takahiro |date=2013-10-01 |title=Implant stability change and osseointegration speed of immediately loaded photofunctionalized implants |journal=Implant Dentistry |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=481–490 |doi=10.1097/ID.0b013e31829deb62 |issn=1538-2982 |pmid=24021973}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the resonance frequency reading increases, it signals that [[osseointegration]] is occurring.&lt;ref name="SuzukiEtal" /&gt; Along with other diagnostic tools, measurements over time can be used to indicate the rate of [[osseointegration]], and treatment plans may be assigned accordingly. If the rate is initially low and does not increase, it signals the implant is not viable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A '''sanatorium''' (also spelled '''sanitorium''' and '''sanitarium''') is a medical facility for long-term illness, most typically associated with treatment of [[tuberculosis]] (TB) in the late-nineteenth and twentieth century before the discovery of [[antibiotics]]. A distinction is sometimes made between "sanitarium" (a kind of health resort, as in the [[Battle Creek Sanitarium]]) and "sanatorium" (a hospital).&lt;ref name="types"&gt;[http://www.lung.ca/tb/tbhistory/sanatoriums/type.html "The Sanatorium Age:'"Sanatorium' vs. 'Sanitarium', An History of the Fight Against Tuberculosis in Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215034537/http://www.lung.ca/tb/tbhistory/sanatoriums/type.html |date=2004-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/68/59/5259.html "Sanitarium, sanatorium, sanitorium"], ''The Columbia Guide to Standard American English'', 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Conception===
The first suggestion of sanatoria in the modern sense was likely made by [[George Bodington]], who opened a sanatorium in [[Sutton Coldfield]] in 1836 and later published his essay, On the Treatment and Cure of Pulmonary Consumption&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bodington|first1=George|title=Dr.|date=1840|publisher=Lichfield|url=https://archive.org/details/anessayontreatm00bodigoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in 1840. His novel approach was dismissed as "very crude ideas and unsupported assertions" by reviewers in the Lancet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keers|first1=Robert|journal=Thorax|date=July 1980|volume=35|issue=7|pages=483–489|url=http://thorax.bmj.com/content/35/7/483|title=The thorax:Two forgotten pioneers. James Carson and George Bodington|doi=10.1136/thx.35.7.483|pmc=471318}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and his sanatorium was converted to an asylum soon after. The rationale for sanatoria in the pre-[[Antibiotics|antibiotic]] era was that a regimen of rest and good nutrition offered the best chance that the sufferer's [[immune system]] would "wall off" pockets of pulmonary TB infection.&lt;ref name=jm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jmvh.org/article/history-of-tuberculosis-part-2-the-sanatoria-and-the-discoveries-of-the-tubercle-bacillus/|work=Journal of Military and Veterans' Health
|title=History of Tuberculosis. Part 2 – the Sanatoria and the Discoveries of the Tubercle Bacillus|author=Frith, John|volume=22|issue=2|series=History|accessdate=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, [[Hermann Brehmer]] opened the ''Brehmersche Heilanstalt für Lungenkranke'' in [[Sokołowsko|Görbersdorf (Sokołowsko)]], [[Silesia]] (now Poland), for the treatment of tuberculosis.  Patients were exposed to plentiful amounts of high altitude, fresh air, and good nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McCarthy OR |title=The key to the sanatoria |journal=J R Soc Med |volume=94 |issue=8 |pages=413–7 |date=August 2001 |pmid=11461990 |pmc=1281640 |url=http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11461990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tuberculosis sanatoria became common throughout Europe from the late-19th century onward.

===Early establishments===
The [[Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium]], established in [[Saranac Lake, New York]], in 1885, was the first such establishment in North America.  According to the Saskatchewan Lung Association, when the National Anti-Tuberculosis Association (Canada) was founded in 1904, its members, including renowned pioneer in the fight against tuberculosis [[Dr. R.G. Ferguson]], believed that a distinction should be made between the health resorts with which people were familiar and the new tuberculosis treatment hospitals: "So they decided to use a new word which instead of being derived from the Latin noun ''sanitas'', meaning health, would emphasize the need for scientific healing or treatment.  Accordingly, they took the [[Latin]] verb root ''sano'', meaning to heal, and adopted the new word sanatorium."&lt;ref name="types"/&gt;

[[Switzerland]] used to have many sanatoria, as health professionals believed that clean, cold mountain air was the best treatment for [[lung diseases]]. In [[Finland]], a series of tuberculosis sanatoria were built throughout the country in isolated forest areas during the early 1900s. The most famous was the [[Paimio Sanatorium]], completed in 1933, designed by world-renowned [[architect]] [[Alvar Aalto]]. It had both sun-balconies and a rooftop terrace where the patients would lie all day either in beds or on specially designed chairs, the [[Paimio Chair]].&lt;ref&gt;Göran Schildt, ''Alvar Aalto - A Life's Work - Architecture, Design and Art'', Otava Publishing, Helsinki, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Portugal]], the Heliantia Sanatorium in [[Valadares (Vila Nova de Gaia)|Valadares]], was used for the treatment of bone tuberculosis between the 1930s and 1960s.

===In 20th-century United States===
In the early 20th century, tuberculosis sanatoria became common in the [[United States]]. In the early 1900s, Arizona's sunshine and dry desert air attracted many people (called "lungers") suffering from tuberculosis, rheumatism, asthma, and numerous other diseases. Wealthier people chose to recuperate in exclusive TB resorts, while others used their savings to make the journey to Arizona and arrived penniless. TB camps in the desert were formed by pitching tents and building cabins. During the tuberculosis epidemic, cities in Arizona advertised the state as an ideal place for treatment of TB.  Many sanatoria in the state of Arizona were modeled after European away-from-city resorts of the time, boasting courtyards and individual rooms. Each sanatorium was equipped to take care of about 120 people. 

The first sanatorium in the Pacific Northwest opened in Milwaukie Heights, Oregon in 1905. Followed closely by the first state-owned TB hospital in Salem, Oregon, in 1910. Oregon was the first state on the West Coast to enact legislation stating that the government was to supply proper housing for people with TB who are unable to receive proper care at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/library/about/collections/historical-collections-archives/exhibits/housing-the-victims.cfm|title=Housing the Victims of the Great White Plague The Oregon State Tuberculosis Hospital|publisher=OHSU|accessdate=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The West Coast became a popular spot for sanatoriums. 

The greatest area for sanatoria was in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] with over 12{{how many?|date=March 2015}} hotel-style facilities in the city. By 1920, Tucson had 7,000 people who had come for treatment of tuberculosis. So many people came to the West that not enough housing was available for them all. In 1910, tent cities began to pop up in different areas; one was described as a place of squalor and shunned by most citizens. Many of the infected slept in the open desert.  The area adjacent to what was then central Phoenix, called Sunnyslope, was home to another large TB encampment, with the residents primarily living in tents pitched along the hillsides of the mountains that rise to the north of the city. Several sanatoria also opened in southern [[California]] in the early party of the 20th century due to the dry, warm climate.&lt;ref name=usc&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scalar.usc.edu/hc/tuberculosis-exhibit/the-sanatorium-movement-in-america|work=The White Plague in the City of Angels|publisher=[[University of Southern California]]|title=The Sanatorium Movement in America|accessdate=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first tuberculosis sanatorium for blacks in the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] [[Southeastern United States|South]] was the [[Piedmont Sanatorium]] in [[Burkeville, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=uva&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/blueridgesanatorium/death.htm|publisher=[[University of Virginia]]|title=The Great White Plague: The Culture of Death and the Tuberculosis Sanatorium| author=Sucre, Richard|accessdate=May 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Waverly Hills Sanatorium]], a [[Louisville, Kentucky]], tuberculosis sanatorium, was founded in 1911. It has become a [[mecca]] for curiosity seekers who believe it is haunted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.louisvillecardinal.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2003/10/21/3f94b487286b5 |title=Waverly Hills Sanatorium still source of local curiosity - Louisville Cardinal, 21 October 2003 |accessdate=2007-10-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031105015142/http://www.louisvillecardinal.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2003/10/21/3f94b487286b5 |archivedate=5 November 2003 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of its dry climate, [[Tuberculosis treatment in Colorado Springs|Colorado Springs was home to several sanatoria]].  [[Sunland Hospital#A.G. Holley Hospital in Lantana|A. G. Holley Hospital]] in Lantana, [[Florida]], was the last remaining freestanding tuberculosis sanatorium in the United States until it closed on July 2, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sunland Hospital#A. G. Holley Hospital in Lantana]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, Stannington Sanatorium was open in the North East of England to treat tuberculosis in children. The sanatorium was opened using funds raised by a local charity, the Poor Children's Holiday Association, now the region's oldest children's charity, [[Children North East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.experiencewoodhorn.com/voices-of-stannington-sanatorium/|title = Voices of Stannington Sanatorium|date = |accessdate = 28 October 2014|website = Woodhorn Museum and Northumberland Archives|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery of antibiotics and decline===
After 1943, when [[Albert Schatz (scientist)|Albert Schatz]], then a graduate student at [[Rutgers University]], discovered [[streptomycin]], an antibiotic and the first cure for tuberculosis, sanatoria began to close.  As in the case of the Paimio Sanatorium, many were transformed into general hospitals. By the 1950s, tuberculosis was no longer a major [[public health]] threat; it was controlled by antibiotics rather than extended rest.  Most sanatoria were demolished years before.

Some, however, have been adapted for new medical roles.  The [[Tambaram Sanatorium]] in south [[India]] is now a hospital for [[AIDS]] patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.vsnl.com/thoracic/page1.html Govt. Hospital of Thoracic Medicine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830083124/http://education.vsnl.com/thoracic/page1.html |date=2006-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The state hospital in [[Sanatorium, Mississippi]], is now a regional center for programs for treatment and occupational therapy associated with [[intellectual disability]]. In Japan in 2001, the ministry of welfare suggested changing the names of a [[leprosarium]] to a sanatorium.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In [[Egyptian mythology]], '''Sekhmet''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|k|ˌ|m|ɛ|t}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2012 |title=Sekhmet |encyclopedia=Dictionary.com |publisher=Random House }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Sachmis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|k|m|ᵻ|s}}), also spelled '''Sakhmet''', '''Sekhet''', or '''Sakhet''', among other spellings, is a warrior goddess as well as goddess of healing. She is depicted as a [[lion]]ess, the fiercest hunter known to the Egyptians. It was said that her breath formed the desert. She was seen as the protector of the [[pharaoh]]s and led them in warfare. 

Sekhmet is also a [[solar deity]], sometimes called the daughter of [[Ra]] and often associated with the goddesses [[Hathor]] and [[Bastet]]. She bears the [[Uraeus]], which associates her with [[Wadjet]] and royalty, and the [[Aten|solar disk]].

== Etymology ==
[[File:Egyptian - "Aegis" with the head of Sakhmet - Walters 57540 - Three Quarter.jpg|thumb|left|This golden cultic object is called an [[aegis]]. It is devoted to Sekhmet, highlighting her solar attributes. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]
Sekhmet's name comes from the [[Ancient Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] word ''sekhem'', which means "power or might". Sekhmet's name is thus translated as "the (one who is) powerful or mighty". She also was given titles such as the "(One) Before Whom Evil Trembles", "Mistress of Dread", "Lady of Slaughter" and "She Who Mauls".

== History ==
In order to placate Sekhmet's wrath, her priestesses performed a ritual before a different [[Sekhmet statues|statue of the goddess]] on each day of the year. This practice resulted in many images of the goddess being preserved. Most of her statuettes were rigidly crafted and do not exhibit any expression of movements or dynamism; this design was made to make them last a long time rather than to express any form of functions or actions she is associated with. It is estimated that more than seven hundred statues of Sekhmet once stood in one [[mortuary temple|funerary temple]] alone, that of [[Amenhotep III]], on the west bank of the [[Nile]].

She was envisioned as a fierce lioness, and in art, was depicted as such, or as a woman with the head of a lioness, who was dressed in red, the color of blood. Sometimes the dress she wears exhibits a rosetta pattern over each breast, an ancient leonine motif, which can be traced to observation of the shoulder-knot hairs on lions. Occasionally, Sekhmet was also portrayed in her statuettes and engravings with minimal clothing or naked. Tame lions were kept in [[Egyptian temple|temples]] dedicated to Sekhmet at [[Leontopolis]].

=== Festivals and evolution ===
To pacify Sekhmet, festivals were celebrated at the end of battle, so that the destruction would come to an end. During an annual festival held at the beginning of the year, a festival of intoxication, the Egyptians danced and played music to soothe the wildness of the goddess and drank great quantities of wine ritually to imitate the extreme drunkenness that stopped the wrath of the goddess—when she almost destroyed humanity. This may relate to averting excessive flooding during the inundation at the beginning of each year as well, when the Nile ran blood-red with the silt from up-stream and Sekhmet had to swallow the overflow to save humankind.

In 2006, Betsy Bryan, an archaeologist with Johns Hopkins University excavating at the temple of [[Mut]] presented her findings about the festival that included illustrations of the priestesses being served to excess and its adverse effects being ministered to by temple attendants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15475319/ "Sex and booze figured in Egyptian rites"], archaeologists find evidence for ancient version of ‘Girls Gone Wild’. From [[MSNBC]], October 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Participation in the festival was great, including the priestesses and the population. Historical records of tens of thousands attending the festival exist. These findings were made in the temple of Mut because when [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] rose to greater prominence, Mut absorbed some characteristics of Sekhmet. These temple excavations at Luxor discovered a "porch of drunkenness" built onto the temple by the Pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]], during the height of her twenty-year reign.

In a myth about the end of Ra's rule on the earth, Ra sends Hathor as Sekhmet to destroy mortals who conspired against him. In the myth, Sekhmet's blood-lust was not quelled at the end of battle and led to her destroying almost all of humanity, so Ra poured out beer dyed with red ochre or hematite so that it resembled blood. Mistaking the beer for blood, she became so drunk that she gave up the slaughter and returned peacefully to Ra.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtheim, Miriam (2006) [1976]. ''Ancient Egyptian Literature, Volume Two: The New Kingdom''. University of California Press. pp. 197–199&lt;/ref&gt; The same myth was also described in the prognosis texts of the Calendar of Lucky and Unlucky Days of papyrus Cairo 86637, where the actions of Sekhmet, Horus, Ra and Wadjet were connected to the eclipsing binary [[Algol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jetsu, L.|author2=Porceddu, S.|title=Shifting Milestones of Natural Sciences: The Ancient Egyptian Discovery of Algol's Period Confirmed|journal = PLOS ONE|volume = 10 |issue = 12|date = 2015|pages = e.0144140 (23pp)|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0144140|pmid=26679699|pmc=4683080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sekhmet later was considered to be the mother of [[Maahes]], a deity who appeared during the [[New Kingdom]] period. He was seen as a lion prince, the son of the goddess. The late origin of Maahes in the [[Egyptian pantheon]] may be the incorporation of a Nubian deity of ancient origin in that culture, arriving during trade and warfare or even, during a period of domination by [[Nubia]]. During the Greek dominance in Egypt, note was made of a temple for Maahes that was an auxiliary facility to a large temple to Sekhmet at [[Taremu]] in the delta region (likely a temple for Bast originally), a city which the Greeks called Leontopolis, where by that time, an enclosure was provided to house lions.

[[File:Office Teeth Whitening.jpg|thumb|327x327px|Office teeth whitening accelerated by light]]
'''Tooth whitening''' (termed '''tooth bleaching''' when utilising bleach), is either the restoration of a natural tooth shade or whitening beyond the natural shade.

Restoration of the underlying natural tooth shade is possible by simply removing surface stains caused by extrinsic factors, stainers such as tea, coffee, red wine and tobacco. The buildup of [[Calculus (dental)|calculus]] and [[Dental tartar|tartar]] can also influence the staining of teeth. This restoration of the natural tooth shade is achieved by having the teeth cleaned by a dental professional (commonly termed "[[Debridement (dental)|scaling]] and [[Tooth polishing|polishing]]"), or at home by various [[oral hygiene]] methods. [[Calculus (dental)|Calculus]] and [[Dental tartar|tartar]] are difficult to remove without a professional clean.

To whiten the natural tooth shade, bleaching is suggested. It is a common procedure in [[cosmetic dentistry]], and a number of different techniques are used by dental professionals. There is a plethora of products marketed for home use to do this also. Techniques include bleaching strips, bleaching pens, bleaching gels and laser tooth whitening. Bleaching methods generally use either [[hydrogen peroxide]] or [[carbamide peroxide]] which breaks down into [[hydrogen peroxide]].

==Natural tooth shade==
[[File:Cross sections of teeth labels.png|thumb|1: crown, 2: root, 3: enamel, 4: dentine and dentine tubules, 5: pulp chamber, 6: blood vessels and nerve within root canal, 7: periodontal ligament, 8: apex and periapical region, 9: alveolar bone]]
The perception of tooth color is the result of a complex interaction of factors such as: lighting conditions, translucency, opacity, light scattering, gloss, the human eye and brain.&lt;ref name=Joiner2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joiner|first1=A|title=Tooth colour: a review of the literature.|journal=Journal of Dentistry|date=2004|volume=32 |issue=Suppl 1|pages=3–12|pmid=14738829|doi=10.1016/j.jdent.2003.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teeth are composed of a surface [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] layer, which is whiter and semitransparent, and an underlying [[dentin]] layer, which is darker and less transparent. These are calcified, hard tissues comparable to [[bone]]. The natural shade of teeth is best considered as such; an off-white, bone-color rather than pure white. Public opinion of what is normal tooth shade tends to be distorted. Portrayals of cosmetically enhanced teeth are common in the media. In one report, the most common tooth shade in the general population ranged from A1 to A3 on the [[VITA Zahnfabrik|VITA]] classical A1-D4 shade guide.&lt;ref name=Herekar2010&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Herekar M|author2=Mangalvedhekar M|author3=Fernandes A|title=The Most Prevalent Tooth Shade in a Particular Population: A survey|journal=Journal of the Indian Dental Association|date=Dec 2010|volume=4|issue=12|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Females generally have slightly whiter teeth than males, partly because females' teeth are smaller, and therefore there is less bulk of dentin, partially visible through the enamel layer. For the same reason, larger teeth such as the molars and the canine (cuspid) teeth tend to be darker. Baby teeth ([[deciduous teeth]]) are generally whiter than the adult teeth that follow, again due to differences in the ratio of enamel to dentin. As a person ages the adult teeth often become darker due to changes in the [[Crystal structure|mineral structure]] of the tooth, as the [[tooth enamel|enamel]] becomes less porous{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} and phosphate-deficient. The enamel layer may also be gradually thinned or even perforated by the various forms of [[tooth wear]].

==Tooth staining and discoloration==
{{main|Tooth discoloration}}
[[Image:Mummery.jpg|thumb|[[Internal resorption]] of the left [[maxillary lateral incisor]] (right in photograph), giving rise to the appearance termed "Pink tooth of Mummery"]]
Teeth may be darkened by a buildup of surface stains (extrinsic staining), which hides the natural tooth color; or the tooth itself may discolor (intrinsic staining).&lt;ref name=Neville2008 /&gt;

=== Extrinsic discolouration ===
Extrinsic stains can become internalised through enamel defects or cracks or as a result of dentine becoming exposed but most extrinsic stains appear to be deposited on or in the [[dental pellicle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sharif|first=N|last2=MacDonald|first2=E|last3=Hughes|first3=J|last4=Newcombe|first4=R G|last5=Addy|first5=M|date=2000-06-10|title=bleaching: The chemical stain removal properties of 'whitening' toothpaste products: studies in vitro|journal=British Dental Journal|volume=188|issue=11|pages=620–624|doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.4800557|issn=1476-5373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Causes of extrinsic staining include:
* [[Dental plaque]]: although usually virtually invisible on the tooth surface, plaque may become stained by chromogenic bacteria such as ''[[Actinomyces]]'' species.&lt;ref name=Rajendran2014 /&gt;
* [[Calculus (dental)|Calculus]]: neglected plaque will eventually calcify, and lead to the formation of a hard deposit on the teeth, especially around the gumline.

=== Intrinsic discolouration ===
Changes in the thickness of the dental hard tissues would result in intrinsic discolouration. There are a few causal factors that may act locally or systematically, affecting only a single tooth or all teeth and cause discolouration as a result. Several diseases that are known to affect the developing dentition especially during enamel and dentine formation can lead to discolouration.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watts|first=A|last2=Addy|first2=M|date=2001-03-24|title=Tooth discolouration and staining: Tooth discolouration and staining: a review of the literature|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/4800959|journal=British Dental Journal|volume=190|issue=6|pages=309–316|doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.4800959|issn=1476-5373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Causes of intrinsic staining include:
* [[Dental caries]] (tooth decay)&lt;ref name="Scully2014" /&gt;
* [[Dental trauma]]&lt;ref name="Scully2014" /&gt; which may cause staining either as a result of [[pulp necrosis]] or [[internal resorption]]. Alternatively the tooth may become darker without pulp necrosis

Causes of extrinsic and intrinsic staining include:
* Age: the tooth enamel becomes thinner over time, which allows the dentine to shine through.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tooth Discoloration|url = http://www.colgateprofessional.com/patient-education/articles/tooth-discoloration|website = www.colgateprofessional.com|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bruxism]] (clenching and grinding of the teeth) can lead to micro-cracking of the incisal edges of the teeth. Extrinsic stains may settle more readily into these cracks, and a thin layer of enamel can be left. This thin enamel layer is partially transparent, allowing the dark background of the mouth to shine through, affording a darker appearance of the incisal edge.

==Methods==
Whitening methods can usually be divided into two types. The first type includes methods that removes surface stains from teeth and includes toothpastes, air polishing and micro abrasion. The second type removes stains that have penetrated the enamel and therefore cannot be removed by the first type. The second type is referred to as "bleaching", typically using either [[hydrogen peroxide]] or [[carbamide peroxide]] which breaks down into hydrogen peroxide.

Bleaching solutions generally contain [[hydrogen peroxide]] or [[carbamide peroxide]], which bleaches the enamel dentine junction to change its color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_sccp/docs/sccp_o_122.pdf | title = Hydrogen peroxide, in its free form or when released, in oral hygiene products and tooth whitening products | publisher = European Union| accessdate = 2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peroxide penetrates the porosities in the rod-like crystal structure of enamel and breaks down stain deposits in  the dentin.

===In-office===

[[File:VITA shade guide2.jpg|thumb|VITA classical A1-D4 shade guide arranged according to [[color|chroma]]; '''A''': red-brown, '''B''': red-yellow, '''C''': grey, '''D''': red-grey]]
Before the treatment, the dentist may examine the patient: taking a health and dental history (including [[allergy|allergies]] and sensitivities), observe hard and soft tissues, placement and conditions of restorations, and sometimes [[x-rays]] to determine the nature and depth of possible irregularities.

The whitening shade guides are used to measure tooth color. These shades determine the effectiveness of the whitening procedure, which may vary from two to seven shades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 18246965|year= 2007|last1= Delgado|first1= E|last2= Hernández-Cott|first2= PL|last3= Stewart|first3= B|last4= Collins|first4= M|last5= De Vizio|first5= W|title= Tooth-whitening efficacy of custom tray-delivered 9% hydrogen peroxide and 20% carbamide peroxide during daytime use: A 14-day clinical trial|volume= 26|issue= 4|pages= 367–72|journal= Puerto Rico Health Sciences Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of bleaching can last for several months, but may vary depending on the lifestyle of the patient. Consuming tooth staining foods or drinks that have a strong colour may compromise effectiveness of the treatment. These include; coffee, fizzy drinks, red-colored sauces etc.

In-office bleaching procedures generally use a [[Dental curing light|light-cured]] protective layer that is carefully painted on the [[gingiva|gums]] and [[Interdental papilla|papilla]] (the tips of the gums between the teeth) to reduce the risk of [[chemical burn]]s to the [[soft tissue]]s. The bleaching agent is either [[Hydrogen peroxide - urea|carbamide peroxide]], which breaks down in the mouth to form [[hydrogen peroxide]], or hydrogen peroxide itself. The bleaching gel typically contains between 10% and 44% carbamide peroxide, which is roughly equivalent to a 3% to 16% hydrogen peroxide concentration. The legal percentage of hydrogen peroxide allowed to be given is 0.1-6%. Bleaching agents are only allowed to be given via dental practitioners, dental therapists and dental hygienists.

Bleaching is least effective when the original tooth color is grayish and may require custom bleaching trays. Bleaching is most effective with yellow discolored teeth. If heavy staining or [[tetracycline]] damage is present on a patient's teeth, and whitening is ineffective (tetracycline staining may require prolonged bleaching, as it takes longer for the bleach to reach the dentine layer), there are other methods of masking the stain. Bonding, which also masks tooth stains, is when a thin coating of composite material is applied to the front of a person's teeth and then [[Dental curing light|cured]] with a blue light. A [[Veneer (dentistry)|veneer]] can also mask tooth discoloration.

The advantages of this technique are that the results happen at one sitting at the dentist, it does not take a longer time for results to show like it does when the home bleaching technique is used. This is good if fast, effective results are required.

However the disadvantages of this technique is that this is a one off treatment and if further whitening is needed the treatment will need to be carried out all over again. However, with at home bleaching, more bleaching gel can be purchased from the dentist and the same trays can be used, as long as they are intact and have no holes in them.

====Light-accelerated bleaching====
Power or light-accelerated bleaching, sometimes colloquially referred to as laser bleaching (a common misconception since lasers are an older technology that was used before current technologies were developed), uses light energy which is intended to accelerate the process of bleaching in a dental office. Different types of energy can be used in this procedure, with the most common being [[halogen light|halogen]], [[LED]], or [[plasma arc]]. Use of light during bleaching increases the risk of tooth sensitivity and may not be any more effective than bleaching without light when high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide are used.&lt;ref name=He2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=He|first1=LB|last2=Shao|first2=MY|last3=Tan|first3=K|last4=Xu|first4=X|last5=Li|first5=JY|title=The effects of light on bleaching and tooth sensitivity during in-office vital bleaching: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Journal of Dentistry|date=August 2012|volume=40|issue=8|pages=644–53|pmid=22525016|doi=10.1016/j.jdent.2012.04.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has shown that the use of a light activator does not improve bleaching, has no measurable effect and most likely to increase the temperature of the associated tissues, resulting in damage.&lt;ref name="nigmed"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The effect of light-activation sources on tooth bleaching |journal=Nigerian Medical Journal |year=2015 |last=Baroudi |first=Kusai |last2=Hassan |first2=Nadia Aly |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=363–8 |doi=10.4103/0300-1652.140316 |pmid=25298598 |pmc=4178330 |accessdate=|quote=The in-office bleaching treatment of vital teeth did not show improvement with the use of light activator sources for the purpose of accelerating the process of the bleaching gel and achieving better results. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://cats.uthscsa.edu/found_cats_view.php?id=2638&amp;vSearch= | title=UTCAT2638, Found CAT view, CRITICALLY APPRAISED TOPICs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideal source of energy should be high energy to excite the peroxide molecules without overheating the pulp of the tooth.&lt;ref name="Grace"&gt;Grace Sun, Lasers and Light Amplification in Dentistry. Dental Clinics of North America, Vol. 44 No. 4, October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Lights are typically within the blue light spectrum as this has been found to contain the most effective wavelengths for initiating the hydrogen peroxide reaction. A power bleaching treatment typically involves isolation of soft tissue with a resin-based, [[Dental curing light|light-curable]] barrier, application of a professional dental-grade [[hydrogen peroxide]] whitening gel (25-38% hydrogen peroxide), and exposure to the light source for 6–15 minutes. Recent technical advances have minimized heat and [[ultraviolet]] emissions, allowing for a shorter patient preparation procedure.

In-office, the teeth are polished using pumice, the bleaching agent is added. The teeth are washed with a lot of water then polished again.

It is recommended to avoid smoking, drinking red wine, eating or drinking any deeply coloured foods after this as the teeth may stain considerably straight after treatment.

==== Nanoparticle Catalysts for Reduced Hydrogen Peroxide Concentration ====
A recent addition to the field is new light-accelerated bleaching agents containing lower concentrations of [[hydrogen peroxide]] with a titanium oxide [[nanoparticle]] based catalyst. Reduced concentrations of hydrogen peroxide cause lower incidences of tooth hypersensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bortolatto|first=J. F.|last2=Pretel|first2=H.|last3=Floros|first3=M. C.|last4=Luizzi|first4=A. C. C.|last5=Dantas|first5=A. a. R.|last6=Fernandez|first6=E.|last7=Moncada|first7=G.|last8=Oliveira|first8=O. B. de|date=2014-07-01|title=Low Concentration H2O2/TiO_N in Office Bleaching A Randomized Clinical Trial|url=http://jdr.sagepub.com/content/93/7_suppl/66S|journal=Journal of Dental Research|volume=93|issue=7 suppl|pages=66S–71S|doi=10.1177/0022034514537466|issn=0022-0345|pmc=4293723|pmid=24868014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nanoparticles act as photocatalysts, and their size prevents them from diffusing deeply into the tooth. When exposed to light, the catalysts produce a rapid,  localized breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into highly reactive [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]]. Due to the extremely short lifetimes of the free radicals, they are able to produce bleaching effects similar to much higher concentration bleaching agents within the outer layers of the teeth where the nanoparticle catalysts are located. This provides effective tooth whitening while reducing the required concentration of hydrogen peroxide and other reactive byproducts at the tooth pulp.

====Internal bleaching on non-vital teeth.====
Internal staining of dentine can discolor the teeth from inside out. Internal bleaching can remedy this on root canal treated teeth. Internal bleaching procedures are performed on devitalized teeth that have undergone [[endodontic treatment]] (root canal treatment) but are discolored due to internal staining of the tooth structure by blood and other fluids that leaked in. Unlike external bleaching, which brightens teeth from the outside in, internal bleaching brightens teeth from the inside out.  Bleaching the tooth internally involves drilling a hole to the pulp chamber no more than 2mm below the gingival margin, cleaning any infected or discoloured dentine, sealing, and filling the root canal with [[gutta-percha]] points, cleaning the inside of the canal using etchant and placing a peroxide gel or sodium perborate tetrahydrate into the pulp chamber so they can work directly inside the tooth on the dentine layer.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} In this variation of whitening  the whitening agent is sealed within the tooth over a period of some days and replaced as needed, the so-called "walking bleach" technique.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}. A seal should be placed over the root filling material to minimise [[microleakage]]. There is a small risk of [[external resorption]].

An alternative to the walking bleach procedure is the inside-out bleach where the bleaching cavity is left open and the patient issued with a custom-formed tray to place and retain the agent, typically a [[carbamide peroxide]] gel inside the cavity. The patient changes the gel over 24 hours and uses a tray to retain it, they return to the dentist where this is sealed. On review once sufficient shade change has occurred the access cavity can be sealed, typically with a [[dental composite]].

===At home===
At-home whitening methods include gels, [[chewing gum]]s, [[Mouthwash|rinses]], [[toothpaste]]s, paint-on films, and whitening strips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ada.org/1902.aspx| title=Statement on the Safety and Effectiveness of Tooth Whitening Products|publisher=American Dental Association|accessdate= 2010-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hasson2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hasson|first1=H|last2=Ismail|first2=AI|last3=Neiva|first3=G|title=Home-based chemically-induced whitening of teeth in adults.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=18 October 2006|issue=4|pages=CD006202|pmid=17054282|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most over-the-counter methods utilize either carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide.&lt;ref name=Hasson2006 /&gt; Although there is some evidence that such products will whiten the teeth compared to [[placebo]], the majority of the published scientific studies were short term and are subject to a high risk of bias as the research was sponsored or conducted by the manufacturers.&lt;ref name=Hasson2006 /&gt; There is no long term evidence of the effectiveness or potential risks of such products.&lt;ref name=Hasson2006 /&gt; Any demonstrable difference in the short term efficiency of such products seems to be related to concentration of the active ingredient.&lt;ref name=Hasson2006 /&gt;

==== Night-guard vital bleaching ====
Night guard vital bleaching is another increasingly popular method of dentist prescribed at home teeth whitening. These methods have gained popularity due to the fact that significant results can be achieved overnight without the removal of any tooth tissue making it a conservative method of lightening tooth shade.The process of night guard vital bleaching involves alginate impressions of the patients’ teeth in the first visit, this is then casted into stone and a custom-made vacuum form tray is made. The patient is provided with bleaching solution, which is placed into the tray for use overnight. The number of nights the tray is used would be dependent on the extent of staining and the shade desired by the patient. 
Due to the recent spike in the use of home teeth whitening products there is a lack of research regarding long term implications such as side effects and duration of results. Research has found that ‘nightguard vital bleaching is a safe, effective, and predictable method to lighten teeth. The whitening effect lasted up to 47 months in 82% of the patients, with no adverse side effects reported at the end of the study’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leonard|first=R.

====Whitening toothpastes====
Whitening toothpastes are different to regular toothpastes in a way that they contain a higher content of abrasives and detergents to fight off tougher stains. Most contain low concentrations of carbamide/hydrogen peroxide ([[Bleach|bleaching agents]]) – this lightens the colour of teeth. These whitening toothpastes make teeth one to two shades lighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carey|first=Clifton M.|date=June 2014|title=Tooth Whitening: What We Now Know|journal=The Journal of Evidence-based Dental Practice|volume=14 Suppl|pages=70–76|doi=10.1016/j.jebdp.2014.02.006|pmc=4058574|pmid=24929591}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toothpastes (dentifrices) which are advertised as "whitening" rarely contain carbamide peroxide, hydrogen peroxide or any other bleaching agent.&lt;ref name=Demarco2009 /&gt; Rather, they are abrasive (usually containing [[alumina]], [[dicalcium phosphate dehydrate]], [[calcium carbonate]] or [[silica]]), intended to remove surface stains from the tooth surface.&lt;ref name=Demarco2009 /&gt; Sometimes they contain enzymes purported to break down the [[biofilm]] on teeth.&lt;ref name=Demarco2009 /&gt; Unlike bleaches, whitening toothpaste does not alter the intrinsic color of teeth. Excessive or long term use of abrasive toothpastes will cause [[Abrasion (dental)|dental abrasion]], thinning the enamel layer&lt;ref name=Demarco2009 /&gt; and slowly darkening the appearance of the tooth as the dentine layer becomes more noticeable. An alternative method of whitening at home, which competes with the use of a whitening paste, is the use of a patent whitening mouthwash. The mouthwash shows marginally better efforts at whitening compared to the use of paste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://cats.uthscsa.edu/found_cats_view.php?id=2368&amp;vSearch= | title=UTCAT2368, Found CAT view, CRITICALLY APPRAISED TOPICs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Over-the-counter (OTC) Whitening Strips and Gels ====
Whitening strips work by the placement of a layer of peroxide gel on the labial surfaces of teeth through the use of plastic strips that are shaped to fit there. Many different types of whitening strips are available on the market, after being introduced in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carey|first=Clifton M.|date=June 2014|title=Tooth Whitening: What We Now Know|journal=The Journal of Evidence-based Dental Practice|volume=14 Suppl|pages=70–76|doi=10.1016/j.jebdp.2014.02.006|issn=1532-3382|pmc=4058574|pmid=24929591}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each variety of whitening strips has its own set of instructions to suit the product, for example, different strips can be used at different frequencies to reach the same whitening end point.

Whitening gels are also peroxide based, like the strips, and applied straight onto the tooth surfaces via the use of a small brush. Following manufacturer’s instructions they can lighten teeth by 1-2 shades.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Whitening Rinses ====
Another method used by people at home to whiten teeth is the use of whitening rinses - these contain oxygen sources, like hydrogen peroxide. To see a 1 -2 improvement in tooth shade could take up to 3 months.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Natural (alternative) methods====
One purported method of naturally whitening the teeth is through the use of [[malic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.com/health/article/0,,20410846,00.html| title=How to Whiten Your Teeth Naturally|accessdate= 2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{medrs|date=September 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-05-2011/5-foods-that-whiten-teeth-naturally.html| title=Foods That Whiten Teeth Naturally|accessdate= 2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{medrs|date=September 2015}} The juice of apples, especially green apples, contains malic acid. On the other hand, excessive consumption of acidic beverages will slowly dissolve the enamel layer, making the underlying yellower dentine show through more noticeably, leading to darkening of the tooth's appearance. One study indicates that malic acid is a weak tooth whitening agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Efficacy of Do-It-Yourself Whitening as Compared to Conventional Tooth Whitening Modalities: An In Vitro Study| journal=Operative Dentistry| volume=40| issue=1| pages=E21–E27| doi=10.2341/13-333-LR| pmid=25279797|year = 2015|last1 = Kwon|first1 = SR| last2=Meharry| first2=M.| last3=Oyoyo| first3=U.| last4=Li| first4=Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indications ==
* Generalized staining of teeth
* Extrinsic staining caused by smoking or diet
* Fluorosis
* White and brown spots 
* Tetracycline staining, although discolouration may not be fully corrected

==Contra-indications==
Some groups are advised to carry out tooth whitening with caution as they may be at higher risk of adverse effects.

* Patients with unrealistic expectations
* Allergic to peroxide
* Pre-existing sensitive teeth
* Cracks / exposed dentine
* Enamel development defects
* [[Acid erosion]]
* Receding gums (gingival recession) and yellow roots, as roots do not bleach as readily as crowns
* Sensitive gums
* Defective dental restorations
* Tooth decay. White-spot decalcification may be highlighted and become more noticeable directly following a whitening process, but with further applications the other parts of the teeth usually become more white and the spots less noticeable.
* Active periapical pathology
* Untreated periodontal disease
* Pregnant or lactating women
* Children under the age of 16. This is because the pulp chamber, or nerve of the tooth, is enlarged until this age. Tooth whitening under this condition could irritate the pulp or cause it to become sensitive. Younger people are also more susceptible to abusing bleaching.&lt;ref name=Demarco2009 /&gt;
* Persons with visible white fillings or crowns. Tooth whitening does not usually change the color of [[Dental fillings|fillings]] and other restorative materials. It does not affect [[porcelain]], other [[ceramic]]s, or dental gold. However, it can slightly affect restorations made with composite materials, cements and [[Amalgam (dentistry)|dental amalgams]]. Tooth whitening will not restore color of [[Dental fillings|fillings]], [[porcelain]], and other [[ceramic]]s when they become stained by foods, drinks, and smoking, as these products are only effective on natural tooth structure. As such, a shade mismatch may be created as the natural tooth surfaces increase in whiteness and the restorations stay the same shade. Whitener does not work where bonding has been used and neither is it effective on tooth-color filling. Other options to deal with such cases are the [[porcelain]] veneers or [[dental bonding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ada.org/2993.aspx?currentTab=1#top| title=Tooth Whitening Treatments|accessdate= 2010-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==
The most common side effects associated with tooth bleaching are increased sensitivity of the teeth and irritation of the gums, which tend to resolve once the bleaching is stopped.&lt;ref name=Hasson2006 /&gt;

The low pH of bleach opens up dentinal tubules and may result in dentine hypersensitivity, bringing about hypersensitive teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advanced Operative Dentistry, A Practical Approach|last=Ricketts|first=David|publisher=Churchill Livingstone Elsevier|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It manifests as increased sensitivity to stimuli such as hot, cold or sweet. 67 – 78% of the patients experience teeth sensitivity after in office bleaching with hydrogen peroxide in combination with heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nathanson|first=D.|last2=Parra|first2=C.|date=July 1987|title=Bleaching vital teeth: a review and clinical study|journal=Compendium (Newtown, Pa.)|volume=8|issue=7|pages=490–492, 494, 496–497|issn=0894-1009|pmid=3315205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=S.

A longer duration of hypersensitivity has been reported 39 days post-bleaching.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Recurrent treatments or use of desensitising toothpastes may alleviate discomfort, though there may be occurrences where the severity of pain discontinues further treatment. [[Potassium nitrate]] and [[sodium fluoride]] are used to reduce tooth sensitivity following bleaching.&lt;ref name="Wang2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Y|last2=Gao|first2=J|last3=Jiang|first3=T|last4=Liang|first4=S|last5=Zhou|first5=Y|last6=Matis|first6=BA|title=Evaluation of the efficacy of potassium nitrate and sodium fluoride as desensitising agents during tooth bleaching treatment-A systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Journal of Dentistry|date=August 2015|volume=43|issue=8|pages=913–23|pmid=25913140|doi=10.1016/j.jdent.2015.03.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irritation of mucous membranes===
Hydrogen peroxide is an irritant and [[cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]]. At concentrations of 10% or higher, [[hydrogen peroxide]] is potentially corrosive to mucous membranes or skin and can cause a burning sensation and tissue damage.&lt;ref name = "a"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=8972882|year=1996|last1=Li|first1=Y| title=Biological properties of peroxide-containing tooth whiteners|volume=34|issue=9|pages=887–904|journal=[[Food and Chemical Toxicology]]|doi=10.1016/s0278-6915(96)00044-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical burns from gel bleaching (if a high-concentration oxidising agent contacts unprotected tissues, which may bleach or discolor [[mucous membrane]]s). Tissue irritation most commonly results from an ill-fitting mouthpiece tray rather than the tooth-bleaching agent.

===Uneven results===
After teeth bleaching, it is normal to have uneven results. With time, the color will appear more even. To avoid this from happening it is important to avoid making some common post-bleaching mistakes, such as consuming foods and beverages that stain the surface of your teeth.

===Return to original pre-treatment shade===
Nearly half the initial change in color provided by an intensive in-office treatment (i.e., 1 hour treatment in a dentist's chair) may be lost in seven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19796303 |year=2009 |last1=Kugel |first1=G |last2=Ferreira |first2=S |last3=Sharma |first3=S |last4=Barker |first4=ML |last5=Gerlach |first5=RW |title=Clinical trial assessing light enhancement of in-office tooth whitening |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=336–47 |doi=10.1111/j.1708-8240.2009.00287.x |journal=Journal of Esthetic and Restorative Dentistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebound is experienced when a large proportion of the tooth whitening has come from tooth dehydration (also a significant factor in causing sensitivity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=15828604 | title = The art and science of tooth whitening | year=2005 | last1=Kugel | first1=G | last2=Ferreira | first2=S | volume=53 | issue=4 | pages=34–7 | journal=Journal of the Massachusetts Dental Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the tooth rehydrates, tooth color "rebounds", back toward where it started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=17024940 | title = Influence of bleaching agents and desensitizing varnishes on the water content of dentin | year=2006 | last1=Betke | first1=H | last2=Kahler | first2=E | last3=Reitz | first3=A | last4=Hartmann | first4=G | last5=Lennon | first5=A | last6=Attin | first6=T | volume=31 | issue=5 | pages=536–42 | journal=Operative Dentistry | doi=10.2341/05-89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Over-bleaching===
Overbleaching, known in the profession as "bleached effect", particularly with the intensive treatments (products that provide a large change in tooth colour over a very short treatment period, e.g., an hour). Too much bleaching will cause the teeth to appear very translucent.&lt;ref name=Freedman2011 /&gt;

===Damage to enamel===
Home tooth bleaching treatments can have significant negative effects on [[tooth enamel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19108942|year=2009|last1=Azer|first1=SS|last2=Machado|first2=C|last3=Sanchez|first3=E|last4=Rashid|first4=R|title=Effect of home bleaching systems on enamel nanohardness and elastic modulus|volume=37|issue=3|pages=185–90|doi=10.1016/j.jdent.2008.11.005|journal=[[Journal of Dentistry]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study has been done and there is evidence that high concentration of carbamide peroxide can damage the enamel surface. Although the effect on enamel is less detrimental than seen after phosphoric acid etch,&lt;ref&gt;Haywood, Van &amp; Houck, V.M. &amp; Heymann, H.O.. (1991). Nightguard vital bleaching: Effects of various solutions on enamel surface texture and color. Quintessence Int. 22. 775-782.&lt;/ref&gt; the increased roughness of the surface may make teeth more susceptible to extrinsic discolouration after bleaching.

=== Weakened dentin ===
Intracoronal bleaching with 30% hydrogen peroxide decreases the micro-hardness of dentin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewinstein|first=I.|last2=Hirschfeld|first2=Z.|last3=Stabholz|first3=A.|last4=Rotstein|first4=I.|date=February 1994|title=Effect of hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate on the microhardness of human enamel and dentin|journal=Journal of Endodontics|volume=20|issue=2|pages=61–63|doi=10.1016/S0099-2399(06)81181-7|issn=0099-2399|pmid=8006565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, weakening the mechanical properties.

=== Effects on existing restorations ===
Dental Amalgam – Exposure to carbamide peroxide solutions increase mercury release for one to two days.&lt;ref&gt;Rotstein I, Mor C, Arwaz JR (1997). "Changes in surface levels of mercury, silver, tin, and copper of dental amalgam treated with carbamide peroxide and hydrogen peroxide ''in vitro''".

"Mercury in solution following exposure of various amalgams to carbamide peroxides". ''Am J Dent'' 6:305–309.&lt;/ref&gt;

Resin Composite – bond strength between enamel and resin based fillings weakened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=American Dental Association|first=|origyear=September 2009|date=November 2010|title=Tooth Whitening/Bleaching:Treatment Considerations for Dentists and Their Patients|url=http://www.ada.org/~/media/ADA/About%20the%20ADA/Files/whitening_bleaching_treatment_considrations_for_patients_and_dentists.ashx|journal=ADA Council on Scientific Affairs|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bleachorexia ===
When bleaching is abused and an individual develops an unhealthy obsession with whitening, the term ''bleachorexia'' or ''whitening junky'' has been used.&lt;ref name="Demarco2009" /&gt; The condition is characterized by repeated bleaching even though the teeth are already white and will not get any whiter.&lt;ref name="Freedman2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Freedman GA|title=Contemporary Esthetic Dentistry|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JP82lK46EtEC&amp;pg=PT1268|date=15 December 2011|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-323-08823-7|chapter=Chapter 14: Bleaching}}&lt;/ref&gt; This condition is somewhat similar to [[body dismorphic disorder]]. The individual perceives their teeth never to be white enough, despite repeated bleaching. A person with bleachorexia will typically continually request more bleaching services or products from the dental professional.&lt;ref name="Freedman2011" /&gt; It has been recommended that a target shade be agreed before starting bleaching treatment to help with this problem.&lt;ref name="Freedman2011" /&gt;

=== Other risks ===
Hydrogen peroxide might act as a tumour promoter.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahl|first=J.E.|last2=Pallesen|first2=U.|date=2016-12-01|title=Tooth Bleaching—a Critical Review of the Biological Aspects|journal=Critical Reviews in Oral Biology &amp; Medicine|volume=14|issue=4|pages=292–304|doi=10.1177/154411130301400406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intracoronal internal bleaching may also cause cervical root resorption,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; it is more commonly observed in teeth that are treated with thermo-catalytic bleaching method. Due to extensive removal of intracoronal dentin, tooth crown fracture can happen after intracoronal bleaching.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The International Agency of Research on Cancer (IARC) has concluded that there is insufficient evidence for the carcinogeni-city of hydrogen peroxide. The chemical is now under Group 3: Unclassifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION INTERNATIONAL AGENCY FOR RESEARCH ON CANCER|first=|date=17 - 24 February 1998, 1999|title=IARC MONOGRAPHS ON THE EVALUATION OF CARCINOGENIC RISKS TO HUMANS: Re-evaluation of Some Organic Chemicals, Hydrazine and Hydrogen Peroxide|url=https://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol71/mono71.pdf|journal=IARC|volume=71|pages=1597|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genotoxic potential of hydrogen peroxide has been evaluated recently. Oral health products that contain or release hydrogen peroxide up to 3.6% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not likely to increase cancer risk in individuals.&lt;ref&gt;SCCNFP (1999).

== Maintenance ==
Although treatment results can be rapid, stains can reappear within the first few months and years of treatment. In order to maintain the whitened appearance, there are ways to protect the teeth and prolong the treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Teeth Whitening - Cost, Types, Results &amp; Risks|url = http://www.docshop.com/education/dental/cosmetic-dentistry/teeth-whitening|website = DocShop|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Chewing gum]]
* Floss to remove plaque

* Drink harsh beverages through a straw&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Maintaining Your White Smile Article {{!}} Whitening Basics {{!}} Colgate® Oral Care Information Whitening &amp; Bonding|url = http://www.colgate.com/en/us/oc/oral-health/cosmetic-dentistry/teeth-whitening/article/how-do-i-maintain-my-newly-whitened-smile|website = www.colgate.com|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Do touch up treatments

==History==
There has been interest in white teeth since ancient times.&lt;ref name=Freedman2011 /&gt; [[Ancient Romans]] used [[urine]] and [[goat milk]] in an attempt to make and keep their teeth whiter.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Guy de Chauliac]] suggested the following to whiten the teeth: ''"Clean the teeth gently with a mixture of honey and burnt salt to which some vinegar has been added."''&lt;ref name=Freedman2011 /&gt; In 1877 [[oxalic acid]] was proposed for whitening, followed by [[calcium hypochlorite]].&lt;ref name=Freedman2011 /&gt; Peroxide was first used for tooth whitening in 1884.&lt;ref name=Freedman2011 /&gt;

==Society and culture==
Teeth whitening has become the most marketed and requested procedure in cosmetic dentistry. More than 100 million Americans whiten their teeth one way or another; spending an estimated $15 billion in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Krupp, Charla. (2008). ''How Not To Look Old.'' New York: Springboard Press, p.95.&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[Food and Drug Administration]] only approves gels that are under 6% hydrogen peroxide or 16% or less of carbamide peroxide. The Scientific Committee for Consumer Protection of the EU consider gels containing higher concentrations than these to be unsafe.&lt;ref&gt;Antoniadou M, Koniaris A, Margaritis V, Kakaboura A. Tooth whitening efficacy of self-directed whitening agents vs 10% carbamide peroxide:a randomized clinical study. J Dent Oral Craniofac Res 2015;1(2):31-35 (doi 10.15761/DOCR.1000107).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a European Council regulation, only a qualified dental professional can legally provide tooth whitening products using 0.1 - 6% hydrogen peroxide, and that the patient must be at least 18 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dentalprotection.org/uk/publications-resources/updates/updates/2014/12/08/tooth-whitening|title=Tooth Whitening|last=|first=|date=8 Dec 2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over recent years, there have been rising concerns over unlicensed staff providing poor quality tooth whitening treatment. Significant evidence has been gathered that tooth whitening procedures have been offered by beauty salons and health clinics under unskilled staff without dental qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gdc-uk.org/api/files/PublicAttitudesToToothWhitening.pdf|title=Public Attitudes to Tooth Whitening Regulations|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of recognised dental boards and organisations called The Tooth Whitening Information Group (TWIG) was established to promote safe and productive tooth whitening information and guidance for the benefit of the public. Reports can be made by the public to TWIG through their website regarding any individual providing illegal tooth whitening services, or if they personally undergone treatment done by an incompetent staff who is not a dental professional.

In Brazil, all bleaching products are classed as cosmetics (Degree II) in legislature.&lt;ref name=Demarco2009 /&gt; There are concerns that this will result in increasing misuse of bleaching products and consequently there have been calls for reclassification.&lt;ref name=Demarco2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Demarco|first1=FF|last2=Meireles|first2=SS|last3=Masotti|first3=AS|title=Over-the-counter whitening agents: a concise review.|journal=Brazilian Oral Research|date=2009|volume=23 Suppl 1|pages=64–70|pmid=19838560|doi=10.1590/s1806-83242009000500010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2098">The '''Total effective dose equivalent''' (TEDE) is a radiation [[dosimetry]] quantity defined by the US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] to monitor and control human exposure to [[ionizing radiation]]. It is defined differently in the NRC regulations and NRC glossary. According to the regulations, it is the sum of [[effective dose equivalent]] from external exposure and [[committed effective dose equivalent]] from internal exposure, thereby taking into account all known exposures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=10 CFR 20.1003|year=2009|publisher=US Nuclear Regulatory Commission|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part020/part020-1003.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the NRC glossary defines it as the sum of the [[deep-dose equivalent]] and [[committed effective dose equivalent]], which would appear to exclude the effective dose to the skin and eyes from non-penetrating radiation such as beta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Total effective dose equivalent|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/total-effective-dose-equivalent-tede.html|work=USNRC Glossary|publisher=US Nuclear Regulatory Commission|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These surface doses are included in the NRC's '''shallow dose equivalent''', along with contributions from penetrating (gamma) radiation.

Regulatory limits are imposed on the TEDE for occupationally exposed individuals and members of the general public.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4305">The '''traceability of [[genetically modified organism]]s''' (GMOs) describes a system that ensures the forwarding of the identity of a GMO from its production to its final buyer. Traceability is an essential prerequisite for the [[Co-existence of genetically modified and conventional crops and derived food and feed|co-existence]] of GM and non-GM foods, and for the freedom of choice for consumers.

==Why traceability is needed==
The traceability of GMOs is founded on two needs. First, consumers in many countries are reluctant to buy genetically modified foods, and are skeptical of the use of GM crops for animal feed. Consequently, the concept of co-existence has been developed to separate GM and non-GM supply chains, and is only possible if all purchasers along the production chain know what they are buying. Secondly, although every GMO that is approved for commercialisation must have passed a safety assessment, it may be necessary to withdraw a certain GMO from the market - for example, if new scientific evidence raises doubts about its safety.

==Unique identifiers for GMOs==
For these purposes, after three years of debate, the [[OECD]] countries came up with an identity code for GMOs in 2002. Initially, some member countries (for example, the USA, but also Canada and Australia) were opposed to the concept. The final decision requires the assignment of a "[[unique identifier]]" to each GMO [[Event (genetic engineering)|event]] which is authorised in one or more OECD countries. The unique identifier is a code consisting of nine letters and/or numbers. The first two or three characters indicate the company submitting the application, while the following six or five characters specify the respective transformation event. The last digit serves as a verifier. All the crop varieties derived from one transformation event will share the same unique identifier.

The unique identifier has been integrated in the [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]] and in the [[European Union]] legislation on the labelling and traceability of genetically modified organisms (Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003). Detailing the unique identifier, the regulation demands the forwarding of written documentation of the identity of a GMO at every stage of the production process. This allows a GMO to be traced even if, for example, due to intensive processing, it can no longer be detected. Using this unique identifier, information on all approved transgenic GMOs is accessible through the [[Biosafety Clearing-House]], the information exchange platform of the Cartagena Protocol.

==Detection methods supplement documentation==
Traceability does not rely solely on documentation. By biochemical means ([[polymerase chain reaction]]) even tiny traces of GMOs can be detected and identified—provided that suitable testing tools exist for the GMO assumed to be present. In the EU, such a tool must be part of the application documents for the approval for commercialisation. For most products and production stages, testing methods are available to monitor and enforce the compliance with traceability regulations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4233">VOCs ([[volatile organic compounds]]) are a dangerous contaminant of [[groundwater]], leading to [[groundwater pollution]].  They are generally introduced to the environment through careless industrial practices.

==Overview==
[[Volatile organic compounds|VOCs]] are responsible for a number of adverse health effects especially for [[breastfeeding|nursing]] and [[pregnant]] mothers.  Many of these compounds were not known to be harmful until the late 1960s and it was some time before regular testing of [[groundwater]] identified these substances in drinking water sources.

==Specific VOCs==
===PCE===
[[Tetrachloroethylene]] is used in metal degreasing and dry cleaning.  It is a suspected to cause cancer, and a host of other health problems.

===TCE===
[[Trichloroethylene]] is used in cleaning metal parts and was widely believed to be harmless before being linked to [[birth defects]]. It is a suspected to cause cancer, and a host of other health problems.

===Toluene===
[[Toluene]] is an organic compound which is mostly harmless to adults and is sometimes abused as an [[inhalant]].  [[Fetal toluene syndrome]] has been defined and resembles [[fetal alcohol syndrome]] with resultant [[birth defects]], but the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] have identified differentiating features between the two [[syndrome]]s including FTS having the additional facial features of [[micrognathia]], large anterior [[fontanel]], down-turned mouth  corners, hair patterning abnormalities, bifrontal narrowing of the face, and ear abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;CDC.

==History==
===Camp Lejeune===
{{Details|Camp Lejeune water contamination}}
U.S. Marine Corps Base [[Camp Lejeune]] was built near [[Jacksonville, North Carolina]] in 1942.  In 1982, the Marine Corps discovered volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in several drinking water wells that fed into two of the eight water systems.  The sources were traced to [[Tetrachloroethylene]] (PCE) from a two dry cleaners - one on base, the other off the base and [[Trichloroethylene]] which had been used in vehicle maintenance on the base.  These problems were addressed but there were concerns with nursing and pregnant mothers who may have been exposed previously.  It wasn't until the late 1990s that the federal government tried to track down people who may have been exposed.

===Love Canal===
{{main|Love Canal}}
[[Love Canal]] was an abandoned canal near [[Niagara Falls, New York]] which was used by the [[U.S. military]] and [[Occidental Petroleum]] as a [[chemical waste]] dumping ground.  Numerous cases of cancer and birth defects were found from the 1950s to the 1970s.  The primary VOC at Love Canal is [[toluene]], which is found along with [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]]s and other [[pollutants]].

===Valley of the Drums===
{{main|Valley of the Drums}}
The [[Valley of the Drums]] is a {{convert|23|acre|m2|adj=on}} toxic waste site in northern Bullitt County, Kentucky, near Louisville, named after the waste-containing drums strewn across the area. Contaminants include 
[[xylene]], [[methyl ethyl ketone]], 
[[methylene chloride]],
[[acetone]],
[[phthalates]],
[[anthracene]],
[[toluene]],
[[fluoranthene]],
[[alkyl benzene]],
[[vinyl chloride]],
[[dichloroethylene]], and [[aliphatic acids]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/rods/fulltext/r0486009.pdf EPA report on the A. L. TAYLOR SITE  - page 5]
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known as one of the primary motivations for the passage of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or Superfund Act of 1980.

'''William Cumin''' (died 17 January 1854) was [[Regius Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (Glasgow)|Regius Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] between 1834 and 1840. 

He was the son of [[Patrick Cumin]] (died 27 October 1820), Professor of Oriental Languages at the University of Glasgow, and his wife Rachael Baird.  The Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]] in a letter to [[Adam Smith]] in June 1761 had recommended Cumin’s father for his position.

William Cumin had been both a surgeon in the army, and later a Professor of Botany at Anderson College, Glasgow, before his appointment to succeed [[Robert Lee (obstetrician)|Robert Lee]] to the Chair of [[Midwifery]] in 1834.

Cumin left the University of Glasgow in 1840 to take up residence at Clifton, Bristol.  He married Ann Johnstone Ker at Glasgow and at Edinburgh in 1821. Cumin died at Bath in 1854.  His grandson, Henry Patrick Cholmeley, MB from the University of Oxford in 1886, was the author of ''John of Gaddes and the Rosa Medicinae'' (1912).

Cumin's niece, Robina Anne Wilson (30 November 1813 – 28 July 1855), the wife of Leopold Cattani Cavalcanti, is buried at the celebrated Protestant Cemetery at Florence with, among other members of the expatriate British community, the poet [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]].

'''William Houstoun''' (occasionally spelt Houston) (1695?–1733) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[surgeon]] and botanist who collected plants in the [[West Indies]], [[Mexico]] and [[South America]].

Houstoun was born in [[Houston, Renfrewshire]]. He began a degree course in medicine at [[St Andrew's University]] but interrupted his studies to visit the [[West Indies]], returning circa 1727. On 6 October 1727, he entered the [[University of Leyden]] to continue his studies under [[Herman Boerhaave|Boerhaave]], graduating [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in 1729. It was during his time at Leyden that Houstoun became interested in the medicinal properties of plants. After returning to England that year, he soon sailed for the [[Caribbean]] and the Americas employed as a ship's surgeon for the [[South Sea Company]]. He collected plants in Jamaica, Cuba, Venezuela, and [[Veracruz|Vera Cruz]], despatching seeds and plants to [[Philip Miller]], head gardener at the [[Chelsea Physic Garden]] in London. &lt;ref name=Boulger&gt;Boulger, G. S. (1900). ''Dictionary of National Biography, 1885 - 1900, Volume 27''. Smith, Elder &amp; Co., London.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable among these plants was ''[[Dorstenia]] contrayerva'', a reputed cure for snake-bite,  and ''[[Buddleja americana]]'', the latter named by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], at Houstoun's request, for the English cleric and botanist [[Adam Buddle]], although Buddle could have known nothing of the plant as he had died in 1715.[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/buddleia] Houstoun published accounts of his studies in ''Catalogus plantarum horti regii Parisiensis''.

When Houstoun returned to London in 1731, he was introduced to Sir [[Hans Sloane]] by Miller. Sloane commissioned him to undertake a three-year expedition, financed by the trustees for the [[Province of Georgia]] 'for improving botany and agriculture in Georgia', and to help stock the Trustee's Garden planned for [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]. Houstoun initially sailed to the [[Madeira Islands]] to gather grape plantings before continuing his voyage across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. However he never completed his mission as he 'died from the heat' on 14 August 1733 soon after arriving in Jamaica; he was buried at [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. Houstoun was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in January 1733. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=2&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27houston%27%29 |title = Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher = Royal Society |accessdate = 21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Houstoun's writings and plant specimens, now preserved in the botanical department of the [[British Museum]], passed from Miller to Sir [[Joseph Banks]], by whom the manuscripts were published as ''[[Reliquiae Houstounianae]]'' in 1781.&lt;ref name=Boulger/&gt; 

==Eponymy==
The genus ''Houstonia'' was named for him by [[Gronovius]], and adopted by Linnaeus.&lt;ref name=Boulger/&gt;

The '''Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities''' is a set of [[Intelligence quotient|intelligence tests]] first developed in 1977 by Richard Woodcock and Mary E. Bonner Johnson.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/437/702/477661/ Mary E. Bonner Johnson, Appellant, v. Richard W. Woodcock, Appellee]&lt;/ref&gt; It was revised in 1989, again in 2001, and most recently in 2014; this last version is commonly referred to as the '''WJ IV'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Content of the tests==
The Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of Cognitive Abilities include both the Standard Battery and the Extended Battery. The Standard Battery consists of tests 1 through 10 while the Extended Battery includes tests 11 through 20. There is also a Woodcock-Johnson III Diagnostic Supplement to the Tests of Cognitive Abilities with an additional 11 cognitive tests.&lt;ref name="Schrank 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schrank|first=F.A.|title=Specification of the cognitive processes involved in performance on the Woodcock-Johnson III (Assessment service Bulletin No. 7)|year=2006|publisher=Riverside Publishing|location=Itasca, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of which combined allows for a considerably detailed analysis of cognitive abilities. The [[Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory]] factors that this test examines are based on 9 broad stratum abilities which are: Comprehension-Knowledge, Long-Term Retrieval, Visual-Spatial Thinking, Auditory Processing, Fluid Reasoning, Processing Speed, Short-Term Memory, Quantitative Knowledge and Reading-Writing.&lt;ref name="Schrank 2006"/&gt; A General Intellectual Ability (GIA) or Brief Intellectual Ability (BIA) may be obtained. The BIA score is derived from three cognitive tests which include Verbal Comprehension, Concept Formation, and Visual Matching. These three cognitive tests measure three abilities; Comprehension-Knowledge (Gc), Fluid Reasoning (Gf), and Processing Speed (Gs), which best represents an individual's verbal ability, thinking ability, and efficiency in performing cognitive tasks. The BIA takes about 10 to 15 minutes to administer and is especially useful for screenings, re-evaluations that don't require a comprehensive intellectual assessment, or research that needs a short but reliable measure of intelligence.&lt;ref name="Riverside Publishing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Woodcock-Johnson III Normative Update (NU) Tests of Cognitive Abilities|url=http://www.riverpub.com/products/wjIIICognitive/details.html|publisher=Riverside Publishing|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the GIA obtained from the WJ III Tests of Cognitive Abilities provide a more comprehensive assessment of general ability (g) and the score is based on a weighted combination of tests that best represents a common ability underlying all intellectual performance.&lt;ref name="Riverside Publishing"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20325">The '''World Health Summit''' is a [[health care]] [[Academic conference|conference]] on global health policy development. Held annually in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] during October, it gathers leaders from [[academia]], [[science]], [[politics]] and [[industry]] as well as stakeholders from the [[private sector]] and [[civil society]].

== History ==
The summit began in 2009 on the occasion of the 300th year anniversary of the [[Charité]] – Universitätsmedizin Berlin. The founders recognized that whilst similar gatherings of leaders were well established in fields such as economic development and technology, a global forum did not exist for medical practice, research and health care systems.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The summit was established under the patronage of the German chancellor, [[Angela Merkel]], and the President of the French Republic, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]. Sarkozy's successor, President [[Francois Hollande]], continued the patronage as did Emmanuel Macron. They were joined in 2013 by [[José Manuel Barroso]], President of the [[European Commission]]. [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] continued this patronage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/the-summit/patronage.html] WHS Patronage&lt;/ref&gt; Four ministries of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany directly support the summit (Health, Foreign Office, Education and Research, Economic Cooperation and Development).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Policy makers|url=http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/partner/policy-makers.html|website=World Health Summit|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)|German Federal Minister of Health]] attends the World Health Summit and holds a keynote in its opening ceremony. When being Governing [[Mayor of Berlin]], [[Klaus Wowereit]], was a regular attendee at the World Health Summit and prominent participant in its opening ceremonies as well.

== Mission ==
According to the World Health Summit's Mission Statement published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 2009, its mission is in keeping with the [[UN Declaration of Human Rights|United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]]' (1948) acknowledgement of health as a fundamental human right. At present, more than half of the world's population is not receiving proper medical care, therefore the organizers of the World Health Summit see their mission as improving [[healthcare]] worldwide and promoting equitable access to medication and prevention. The achievement of this mission is seen as threatened by unsolved and newly emerging problems such as: "the demographic shift to an ageing society; [[climate change]] and its health consequences that are already being felt; new types of epidemics, such as [[obesity]], mental ill-health, and violence and injury, in developed and developing countries, it is eradicating the diseases of [[HIV]], [[tuberculosis|TB]], and [[malaria]]; the rising costs of health care; and the worldwide [[economic crisis]] and its serious threats to the health of populations across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/about-whs/vision-and-goals.html] WHS Vision and Goals&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Health Summit seeks to actively address these challenges by bringing together stakeholders from [[research]], education, clinical care and many other disciplines to jointly develop strategies to tackle these major health care issues. The outcome of each multi-sectoral Summit is intended to inform and influence decision-makers such as governments and supranational agencies, as recommendations for meeting future health care challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adli|first1=Mazda|last2=Kleinert|first2=Sabine|last3=Lafont|first3=Antoine|last4=Kahn|first4=Axel|last5=Ganten|first5=Detlev|title=Shaping future health: Berlin Evolution of Medicine Summit|journal=The Lancet|date=2009|volume=373|issue=9663|pages=519–520|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60177-X|pmid=19217972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Previous World Health Summits ===
The first World Health Summit under the motto "The Evolution of Medicine" took place October 14–18, 2009; 700 participants worked on concrete recommendations for dealing with pandemic planning, effective prevention strategies and climate change-related diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Charité Berlin, Book of Proccedings 2009: http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/fileadmin/downloads/Dokumente/WHS%202010%20Book%20of%20Proceedings.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Health Summit Program 2009: The Evolution of Medicine http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/fileadmin/downloads/whsSummitProgram.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the World Health Summit was held October 10–13, focused on the continuum of: "Translation – Transition – Transformation"; in keeping with these topics, solutions facilitating the translation of medical knowledge into interventions that benefit patients across the globe, the new health challenges in a world of constant transition and the transformation of health politics and management to respond to these challenges were addressed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/about-whs/history/2010.html] WHS History 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The third World Health Summit took place October 23–26, 2011 under the motto: "Today's Science – Tomorrow's Agenda".  The former element of this theme recognised that progress in research and technology development is occurring at an unsurpassed rate, while concurrently the challenges have never been greater, with new phenomena such as the health effects of climate change through the distribution of food and water, but also of vector-borne diseases.  The latter reflected that no country has yet discovered an ideal health-service model, and that therefore the links between evidence and policy on all levels (national and international) needed to be strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/about-whs/history/2011.html] WHS History 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth World Health Summit, held from October 20–24, 2012, under the theme: “Research for Health and Sustainable Development" focused on finding novel solutions for non-communicable diseases and conditions of global concern, such as obesity, diabetes, and mental illness.  This recognised that unhealthy lifestyles are a main cause of these new epidemics, and promoted greater awareness of the global economic risks and human suffering related to the epidemiological transition, as well as the urgent need for sustainable solutions enabling healthcare systems to meet the challenge of non-communicable diseases and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/about-whs/history/2012.html] WHS History 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth World Health Summit, held from October 20–22, 2013, was the first Summit without individual theme. Instead, heightened emphasis was put on the four thematic tracks, structuring the program: Research and Innovation; Education and Leadership; Evidence to Policy; Global Health for Development. For the first time, the World Health Summit was held at the Federal Foreign Office in Berlin. 1,200 participants attended the Summit, additional 1,200 followed the official webcast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/about-whs/history/2013.html] WHS History 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism and engagement ===
The World Health Summit has been criticized by Thomas Gebauer, Director of Medico International, as an "elitist club of decision makers",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aerzteblatt.de/nachrichten/38559/Alternativkonferenz_zum_World_Health_Summit_Wir_brauchen_keinen_neuen_Club.htm&lt;/ref&gt; that ignores both the social factor of global health issues and the notion of health as a human right, but rather serves particular interests. Thus, in 2009, this Frankfurt-based organization initiated an alternative conference as a form of protest against the World Health Summit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medico.de/en/search/?cx=007400307825010633883%3A10wmrhxa_wm&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=world+health+summit&amp;sa=Search#947&lt;/ref&gt;

Permanent President of the World Health Summit, Professor Dr med Detlev Ganten, has consistently displayed a readiness to engage in constructive discussion with critics, inviting participants of the 2009 alternative conference to attend the World Health Summit 2010 and, thus to enter into a dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aerzteblatt.de/nachrichten/38559/Alternativkonferenz_zum_World_Health_Summit_Wir_brauchen_keinen_neuen_Club.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of the M8 Alliance ==
The M8 Alliance of Academic Health Centers, Universities and National Academies is an academic network of institutions of education and research, including national academies where these exist. It was first officially inaugurated in 2009 on occasion of the first World Health Summit. This international network provides the academic foundation to the World Health Summit.

According to the M8 Alliance Profile,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/m8-alliance/mission.html&lt;/ref&gt; the network seeks to improve [[global health]] and works with political and economic decision makers and civil society to develop science-based solutions for health challenges worldwide. It was created as a permanent platform for framing future considerations of global medical developments and health challenges.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/m8-alliance/profile/&lt;/ref&gt;

A key role of the M8 Alliance is to provide an academic foundation to each World Health Summit, with members contributing to topics and program development.

===Members of the global M8 Alliance===
