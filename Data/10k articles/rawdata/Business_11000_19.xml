'''Actelion''' is a pharmaceuticals and biotechnology company established in December 1997, headquartered in Allschwil near Basel in Switzerland.&lt;ref name=fierce&gt;{{cite web|title=Johnson &amp; Johnson scraps phase 3 antibiotic program acquired in $30B Actelion takeover|url=https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/j-j-scraps-phase-3-antibiotic-program-acquired-30b-actelion-takeover|first1=Nick Paul|last1=Taylor|date=17 April 2018|access-date=5 July 2018|publisher=Fierce Biotech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actelion specializes in [[orphan diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medicine|url = http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actelion scientists were among the first to work in the field of endothelian receptor antagonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Businessweek|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=ATLN:VX}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company name might be a reminder for its first product, an endothelian receptor antagonist and the verb "action", "act upon". Actelion was initially financed with [[venture capital]] provided through a syndicate including Atlas Venture, [[Sofinnova]] and [[HealthCap]].

Actelion has 29 operative affiliates around the world, including the United States, Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan, Switzerland and a number of EU countries.
The Swiss affiliate is located in Baden, the German affiliate in [[Freiburg]], the Austrian one in [[Vienna]], the French one in [[Paris]] and the UK affiliate is located in [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actelion affiliates|url=http://www.pah-info.com/Affiliates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the company established the Actelion Endothelin Research Award programme which supports selected clinical research projects.

In January 2017, [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] announced that it would purchase the company for $30 billion.&lt;ref name=wsj-rockoff&gt;{{Citation

==Background and family==
Müller was born in [[Zagreb]] to a poor [[Jew]]ish family with many children.&lt;ref name="žz"/&gt; Due to lack of money, when he completed the elementary school, Müller was educated for [[Cooper (profession)|cooper]] and [[carpentry]] craft. At 25, Müller married Fanika Müller ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Mülhofer), from [[Krapina]].

==Business career==
[[File:Muellorova ciglana.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Müller brick factory in Zagreb]]
In [[Josipdol]], near [[Ogulin]], Müller opened grocery store and a restaurant. Soon after he bought the store "Zlatni zvon" in Zagreb. Müller was extremely entrepreneurial and motivated, and that store in a short time become one of the best in town. Müller ran his shop for 25 years, later also trading in coal and brick. Müller established a brick factory in Zagreb, and a [[brickyard]] near [[Karlovac]]. He also owned several brickyards in [[Kustošija]], Zagreb.&lt;ref name=jl/&gt;&lt;ref name=zo/&gt;

==Cultural activity==
Müller invested his earnings and capital in the Zagreb culture. Around 1913 he financed the construction of "Helios" cinema (now [[Gavella Drama Theatre]]). He merged cinemas "Helios", "Apollo", "Union" and film institute "Urania" into one company. In 1919, Müller purchased a residential-commercial complex in Varšavska and Masarykova Street.&lt;ref name=jl/&gt; There, in 1924, Müller financed the construction of "Balkan" cinema (now called "Europa"), under architect [[Srećko Florschütz]].&lt;ref name=zo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kinoeuropa.hr/index.php?page=b0&amp;lang=hr|title=Povijest kina Europa|publisher=www.kinoeuropa.hr|date=|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Belda was born in Morocco

==Business experience==
* Non executive Chairman of the board from April 2008 to June 2010
*Chief executive officer and Chairman of the board from January 2001 to April 2008
*President and Chief Executive Officer of Alcoa from May 1999 to January 2001
*President and Chief Operating Officer of Alcoa from 1997 to May 1999

*From 1979 to 1994, he was President of [[Alcoa Aluminio S.A.]] in Brazil, Alcoa's Brazilian affiliate

==Compensation==
While CEO of Alcoa in 2007, Alain J. P. Belda earned a total compensation of $25,931,201, which included a base salary of $1,457,500, a cash bonus of $1,000,000, stocks granted of $6,978,791, and options granted of $13,558,026.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equilar.com/CEO_Compensation/ALCOA_INC_Alain_J._P._Belda.php CEO Compensation for Alain J. P. Belda] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208210653/http://equilar.com/CEO_Compensation/ALCOA_INC_Alain_J._P._Belda.php |date=2009-02-08 }}, Equilar.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
On October 6, 2005, in the paper [[EXAME]] in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], there appeared an article by journalist [[Alexa Salomão]], where Belda was quoted as saying Alcoa was paying Brazilians twice as much for energy for the corporation's Brazilian [[aluminum smelter]]s, as it was paying [[Iceland]]'s state-run energy firm [[Landsvirkjun]]: "...the agreed price — 30 dollars per megawatt-hour — was far from ideal. In Iceland, the company pays half that." ([http://mar.anomy.net/files/2006/06/alcoa-frett.htm]) When this news reached Icelandic media, on June 7, 2006 ([http://eggin.blogdrive.com/archive/129.html], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060612204742/http://www.malbein.net/pallasgeir/?p=149]), the reaction was negative from environmentalists opposed to the already controversial [[Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant]], and others, as Icelandic citizens and other firms pay 8 times that.

[[Friðrik Sophusson]], the director of [[Landsvirkjun]], said the quoted price was ridiculous, the real price being somewhat higher. A [[New York City|New York]] spokesperson for Alcoa said Belda had been "inaccurate" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070930154655/http://ruv.is/heim/frettir/frett/store64/item73762/]) in the interview. An Icelandic social-democratic [[member of parliament]], [[Helgi Hjörvar]], who is on the board of [[Landsvirkjun]], challenged authorities to reveal the real price and thus "clear the air" surrounding the project—the dam and the smelter. No answer was ever received. Representatives of Alcoa finally apologized to [[Landsvirkjun]] for the slip-up, Salomão's article was removed from Alcoa's website.

==Other directorships==
[[Citigroup Inc.]] and [[DuPont|E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]] and    [[International Business Machines]]. Mr. Belda serves on the board of trustees of [[The Conference Board]], the world's leading business membership and research organization, and is a member of the board of trustees of the [[Brown University Corporation]].

'''Andrew Hughes''' (アンドリュー・ヒューズ, ''Andoryû Hyûzu'' born 1908 ) is a Turkish-born actor and business executive best known for acting in several Japanese films.&lt;ref name="de Gruyter"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most notable role was that of [[Adolf Hitler]] in the 1965 Japanese comedy ''Crazy Adventure''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tohokingdom.com/movies/crazy_adventure.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes has also appeared in films such as ''[[King Kong Escapes]]'' (1967), ''[[Destroy All Monsters]]'' (1968), ''[[Nihon Chinbotsu (1973 film)|Tidal Wave]]'' (1973), ''[[ESPY (film)|ESPY]]'' (1974), and ''[[Sayonara Jupiter (film)|Sayonara Jupiter]]'' (1984). He also starred in the Hollywood films ''[[The Last Voyage]]'' (1960) and ''[[Flight from Ashiya]]'' (1964) (both partially filmed and set in Japan).&lt;ref name="Afi"&gt;

==Career==
Being virtually exclusively active in the Japanese film industry, Hughes was often cast in the roles of various Westerners, often portraying an international reporter, politician or foreign military officer. Not much is known about Hughes's early, pre-acting years, but it is known that he was born in Ottoman Turkey where he originally worked as a career businessman with some small-time acting experience as an extra. Actor [[Robert Dunham]] asserted that most fellow Western actors in Japan were in fact of Turkish origin as many Turks had fled to Japan after the Turkish revolution by ways of China in order to avoid being drafted to the army. Hughes was ultimately based in Tokyo as an import-export businessman and eventually started making numerous appearances in Japanese films in a career that spanned from the late 1950s to the mid-1980s. As most Westerners appearing in Japanese films at the time spoke little or no Japanese, Hughes was dubbed by Japanese-speaking actors in most of his films.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0400447/bio&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://exploderbutton.com/exploder/andrew-hughes-a-life-in-japanese-pictures/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryfle"&gt;

'''Arthur Joseph Munby''' (19 August 1828 – 29 January 1910) was a British [[diarist]], [[poetry|poet]], portrait photographer, [[barrister]] and [[solicitor]]. He is also known by his initials, '''A. J. Munby'''.

==Biography==
Arthur Munby was born in [[York]]. He was educated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], graduating with a BA in 1851, and was [[called to the Bar]] from [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MNBY847AJ|name=Munby, Arthur James}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a civil servant in the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]]' office from 1858 until his retirement in 1888. His published poetry included ''Benoni'' (1852) and ''Verses New and Old'' (1865). He taught [[Latin]] at the [[Working Men's College]] for more than a decade and helped promote the Working Men's College Volunteer Corps, a response to the national call for Volunteer Rifle Corps (1859) to combat a perceived threat from Napoleon the Third. Munby penned verses of support, the ''Invicta: a Song of 1860'', for the 19th [[Middlesex Regiment]], a regiment to which the W.M.C.V.C. was attached.&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;[[J. F. C. Harrison|Harrison, J. F. C.]] ,''A History of the Working Men's College (1854-1954)''. London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, a sister Working Women's College was established; Munby was a leading spirit of, and teacher at, the new college.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt;

Munby had a lifelong fascination with working-class women, particularly those who did hard physical labour. His favourite pastime was wandering the streets of London and other industrial cities where he approached working women to ask about their lives and the details of their work, while noting their clothes and [[dialect]]s. The observations were recorded in his journals.

He was an amateur artist, and his diaries contain sketches of working women. He collected hundreds of photographs of [[Pit brow women|women who worked at collieries]], kitchen maids, milkmaids, charwomen, acrobats and so on. His diaries and images provide historical information on the lives of working-class Victorian women. Much of his obsession is hinted at in his last book, ''Faithful Servants: being epitaphs and obituaries recording their names and services'' (1891).

His papers are housed at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], there is a list of his papers on the Cambridge Janus website&lt;ref name="Munby papers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trinity College Library Cambridge: MUNB|url=http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0016%2FMUNB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hannah Cullwick ===
In 1854, while on one of his urban wanderings, Munby met [[Hannah Cullwick]], a Shropshire-born maid-of-all-work. They formed a relationship in which Munby was the master and Cullwick the slave, with him training her in the virtues of hard work and loyalty. His scenarios included elements of [[ageplay]] and [[paraphilic infantilism|infantilism]], with Cullwick holding him in her lap or carrying him.

They married secretly in 1873 but Cullwick resisted his efforts to make her into a lady and she lived with him as a domestic servant, not a wife. She played the role of a lady wife on trips to Europe. They separated in 1877, but continued to see each other until Cullwick's death in 1909. The marriage was secret from all but a few close friends; he revealed it to his brother only a few months before his own death from [[pneumonia]].

'''Bleisure travel''' ('''UK''' /ˈbleʒ.əʳ/ '''US''' /ˈbliː.ʒɚ/) is a [[portmanteau]] of “[[business]]” and “[[leisure]]”, and, it refers to “the activity of combining [[business travel]] with leisure time”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionaryblog.cambridge.org/author/cambridgewords|title=About words. New words – 1 January 2018|last=|first=|date=1 January 2018|website=Cambridge Dictionary|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term bleisure was first published in 2009 by the Future Laboratory as part of their biannual Trend Briefing. The term was originally coined by writer and silent revolutionist, Jacob Strand, then a future forecaster working for The Future Laboratory. And co-written by journalist and futurologist Miriam Rayman.

In [[Corporate business travel|corporate business]] travel, extending a business trip for personal purposes is also known as “bizcation”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vlex.com/vid/maximizing-the-value-of-641761817|title=Maximizing the value of conferences to communities: 'Bleisure Travel' and 'Bizcations' emerge with social media boosts.|last=Zak|first=Karen|date=2016|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon has been studied from 2011, from this year on, a report shows that bleisure travel has been maintaining a constant growth, accounting for 7% of all business trips.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www3.gbta.org/l/5572/2017-06-02/55l1xn|title=Extending business travel into leisure time – Bleisure study|last=Global Business Travel Association in partnership with Hilton|first=|date=June 2017|website=GBTA Foundation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bleisure traveller profiles ==
Bleisure travellers can be described as “individuals who combine leisure with professional business obligations when abroad&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lichy, McLeay|first=Jessica, Fraser|date=August 2017|title=Bleisure, motivation and typologies|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318878088_Bleisure_Motivations_and_Typologies?enrichId=rgreq-0166c8432de1f7b171f9bd6a403e0082-XXX&amp;enrichSource=Y292ZXJQYWdlOzMxODg3ODA4ODtBUzo1MjMyMjc3MDI4NjE4MjRAMTUwMTc1ODYxMzY5Nw%3D%3D&amp;el=1_x_3&amp;_esc=publicationCoverPdf|journal=Journal of Travel &amp; Tourism Marketing|volume=|pages=|via=Research Gate}}&lt;/ref&gt;”.

The elements characterising bleisure travellers are some and different, this make difficult to draw a defined profile of these individuals. Bleisure is a widespread practice among US travellers, especially for those working in [[Technology]], [[Health system|Healthcare]], [[Public administration|Public Administration]] sectors. A report shows that US traveller add bleisure to nearly half of the cases, precisely 52% for International trips and 42% for domestic ones. The main reasons for travelling would be [[conference]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]], [[team building]], client meetings and [[presentation]]s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.advertising.expedia.com/influencing-bleisure-travelers|title=Profile of American bleisure traveller|last=Expedia Media Solutions and Luth Research|first=|date=6 December 2016|website=Expedia Media Solutions Blog|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bleisure travellers could be grouped according to various aspects, in particular [[gender]], [[Ageing|age]] and trip frequency.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.carlsonwagonlit.com/content/dam/cwt/pdf/insights/20160712-solutions-group-white-paper-bleisure.pdf|title=A quantitative look at the bleisure phenomenon|last=CWT Solutions Group|first=|date=July 2016|website=Carson Wagonlit Travel|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research indicates that female business travellers would be more likely to take bleisure trips than male. In both groups 20% of travellers would take one or more bleisure trips in a year time, however women look to register higher rate: 8.5% against 6.8% of men.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;To explain this observation, CWT have looked at the average number of bleisure trips per bleisure travellers per year, this was roughly the same value for both genders (1.4). However, women take overall fewer business trips than men, on average. This difference in the total amount of business travel is responsible for the higher bleisure rate measured in the female population.&lt;/ref&gt;

Younger travellers (between 20 and 25) look significantly more likely to add weekends to their business trips, measuring a rate close to 15%. This result is two or three times higher than those for 45-50 age interval.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;To explain this finding, CWT calculated the average number of bleisure trips  in each segment. Across the age range 20 to 65, this varies from 1.3 to 1.5 bleisure trips/year. At the same time, the amount of total travel varies much more significantly (+2 trips/year), from the 20-25 to the 45-50 age interval. The larger denominator in the bleisure rate is thus responsible for the lower values observed in the 45-50 group. Interpretation: these results show that travellers appear to have fixed capacity for bleisure: when they do it, they take 1 or bleisure trips per year, almost irrespective of how much they travel. In other words, bleisure does not scale with the total amount of travel.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Millennials]] travellers deserve a special attention because they appear to be the individuals shaping the future of business travel, nearly twice likely to travel for business than [[Baby boomers|Baby Boomers]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This could be attributed to their flexible attitude to life, which would lead to the blurring of the line between their private and professional life. Millennials seem to work often from home or during the evening hours, to dedicate leisure on-goings to traditional work hours. A consequence of this freedom could be their willingness to extend business trips including [[vacation]] activities. In comparison with other age group, Millennials look to be more likely to take bleisure trips, compared to older travellers. However, it is not clear whether this reflects unique preferences or transitory life events.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Do take more bleisure trips than other generations did in their 20s and 30s? Or will Millennials take much fewer bleisure trips in later years? It seems possible that Millennials are actually different. One observation in particular would reinforce this idea: When business travellers have children, they seem to be equally likely to extend their trip, compared to those who do not have them. This would suggest that, when Millennials will have families in greater numbers, they may still take bleisure trips&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequent travellers taking 20 trips or more per year seem to be less than 5% likely to take a bleisure trip during the year, they would account for 8% of all bleisure trips. By contrast, one third of all bleisure trips would be taken by employees travelling once a month.

== Factors influencing the phenomenon ==
It seems evident that Millennials workers are increasingly demanding for bleisure from their work trip. Despite the state-of-the-art technology available nowadays, Millennials still prefer face-to-face meetings to get business done, therefore travel is still important for business companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hub.gbta.org/groups/reviews/item/20/11/2155|title=GBTA Business Traveler Sentiment Index™|last=GBTA Foundation|first=|date=2015|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bleisure travel looks as a good opportunity to save on travel expenses, mostly for those who do not take a lot of vacation: 66% of US business traveller spend more money on leisure activities because of the money they save on travel. 60% take bleisure trips because do not have a lot of regular vacations. To decide whether to turn a business travel into bleisure or not, employee takes into consideration travelling on exciting destinations, additional costs required to extend the trip, how close the trip is to the weekend, the number of night they must stay for business, how affordable the hotel is, whether they have friends or family in the area, whether they can bring friends or family along. The general trend would indicate the addition of one or two days as the most frequent option, only 23% of bleisure travellers would extend their trips for more than three days. In many cases leisure days equal (37%) or even exceed business days (42%). The length of business trip seems to be a crucial factor when considering extending the trip in 62% of cases. In particular, when business days are more than three, bleisure travellers are not only likely to extend the trip, but also to visit different cities in the area.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Advantages for employee and companies ==
For the [[Employment|employees]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vlex.com/vid/welcome-to-the-world-678428901|title="Welcome to the world of bleisure: the trend is growing of adding leisure time to the business trip."|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Compromise between work [[duties]] and leisure time;
* [[Career development]].
* Possibility to bring family or friend with them; 
* Improvement of their [[well-being]];
For the companies:
* Improvement of the knowledge about the culture of the location they’re visiting that would simplify business negotiations;
* Possibility to have happier and therefore more productive employees;
* Discounted rate offered by the hotels;
* Opportunity to recruit new workers and attempting to retain current ones.

== Main activities and destinations ==
The more likely bleisure destinations are cities offering a combination of different elements, which could allow the travellers to add leisure time to their business trip, such as sightseeing locations, [[Sports venue|sport venues]] and cultural events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The difference between the origin and the destination city seems to affect bleisure rates: in the case of domestic trips, the amount of bleisure is expected to be low because the two cities should be easily accessible and share similar culture. On the other hand, long intercontinental trips would offer the chance to know realities that are different from ordinary. Researches seem to confirm this trend: bleisure trips would account for 5.2% of the domestic trips and 9.7% of the international ones. The highest bleisure rate (18.4%) appears in international trips when the origin and destination cities are located in different geographical regions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The top bleisure cities in [[United States|US]] are: [[Honolulu]] (above 20%), [[Miami]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Las Vegas]] (12-15%) [[New York City|NYC]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Diego]] and [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] (9-12%). In [[Europe]] rates looks lower, this could be due to the shorter domestic and continental routes: [[Lisbon]], [[Barcelona]], [[Nice]], [[Istanbul]] (8-11%), [[London]], [[Dublin]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Moscow]], [[Rome]], [[Geneva]], [[Paris]], [[Madrid]] (6-8%).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Corporate policy ==
Given that bleisure travel is a rising phenomenon, there is still no official regulation, therefore extending business trips for bleisure would have to be decided by [[management]] on a case-by-case basis. Some preventive measures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amexglobalbusinesstravel.com/the-atlas/bleisure-travel-policy/|title=American Express Global Business Travel|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; could be followed in advance to avoid misunderstanding.
* Companies have to differentiate between business and non-business amenities and declare what is willing to pay for; 
* Employees have to define when the business travel ends and when the leisure one starts;
* Company and employees must arrange a corporate travel insurance.

'''Bottom of the harbour tax avoidance''' was a form of [[tax avoidance]] used in [[Australia]] in the 1970s.  Legislation ([[#Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980|below]]) made it a [[Crime|criminal offence]] in 1980.  The practice came to symbolise the worst of variously contrived tax strategies from those times.

&lt;!-- cited in the AIC paper --&gt;
In its 1986/87 annual report, the [[Australian Taxation Office]] (ATO) stated a total 6,688 companies had been involved, involving revenue of between $500 million and $1 billion.

==Operation==

The operation at the heart of bottom of the harbour schemes was simple.  A [[company (law)|company]] would be stripped of [[asset]]s and accumulated [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] before its [[tax]] fell due, leaving it then unable to pay.

&lt;!-- Cities other than Sydney have harbours, but as far as the figurative "bottom of the harbour" went it usually referred to Sydney harbour.  See James Popple's article cited in the references for instance. --&gt;
Once assets were stripped, the company would be sent, metaphorically, to the "bottom of the harbour" by being transferred to someone of limited means and with little interest in its past activities.  The company's records were often lost too.  The ATO, being in the same position as other unsecured [[creditor]]s in the case of an [[insolvent]] company, ended up with nothing.

Promoters such as [[lawyer]]s or [[accountant]]s generally facilitated the transactions.  The promoter would help the owners of a company first transfer the assets to a new company which was to continue the business, then the owners sold the old company to the promoter for the value of the untaxed accumulated profits, less an amount representing a fee or commission.  For the owners this was the sale of a capital asset and hence untaxed (being prior to [[Capital gains tax in Australia|Capital Gains Tax]]).

The promoter would have the company pay (to the promoter) a dividend of the money it had left, then the promoter on-sold the now empty shell to someone else.  The way the promoter paid the owners for undistributed profits was similar to a [[dividend strip]] operation.  In any case the amount the promoter paid was a [[tax deduction]] (since the promoter would be in the business of buying and selling shares) and the dividend would be [[taxable income]], leaving just the promoter's commission taxable, not the whole original company profit.

The "harbour" in the expression was usually taken as referring to [[Sydney Harbour]]&lt;!-- see James Popple's article cited below--&gt; (which is adjacent to the financial district), though obviously the sense is also quite general.  The actual origin of the name and the practice is not clear.

==Deputy Crown Solicitor debacle==
The first time the [[Australian Taxation Office]] (ATO) detected a bottom of the harbour scheme was in 1973. Rod Todman, a senior investigations officer in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], found a scheme involving about 50 companies and selected one for investigation. By 1974, he had assembled evidence which was referred to the [[Australian Government Solicitor|Deputy Crown Solicitor]] (DCS) in Perth for possible prosecution as a [[Test case (law)|test case]].

The DCS was uncertain of the prospects for the case, but in late 1974 had a [[Queen's Counsel]] opinion strongly recommending charges of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to [[Fraud|defraud]] the Commonwealth be brought against the promoter and two other individuals. There then followed delay upon delay, duplicated investigations, ill-prepared reports by inexperienced officers, and even a DCS officer deliberately avoiding contact with the ATO.

After five full years, in April 1979, and based on miscommunication, the Crown Solicitor in [[Canberra]] advised the ATO that the evidence was insufficient and the case was dropped. It might well have been that it was not strong enough, but that decision was not arrived at in a well-considered way.  The performance of the various DCS officers was later the subject of scathing criticism, with problems arising primarily from overworked and underskilled staff, and bad management.

The abandoned case only came to light in 1982 in the [[Costigan Royal Commission]] investigating activities of the [[Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union]]. The Commission came upon bank account transactions for millions of dollars, and the "paper trail", as it was called, led eventually, and among other things, to the bottom drawers of the DCS Perth.

One of those other things the commission found was that the wife of one of the senior case officers at the DCS Perth was running an [[Prostitution#Escort/Out-call Prostitution|escort service]], and that she was a [[company secretary]] at several companies which were involved in bottom of the harbour schemes. There was no suggestion her husband improperly used his position, but the connection was close enough to be extremely embarrassing for all concerned, and the officer was dismissed.

==Legislation==

===''Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980''===
In 1980, the ''Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980'' put an end to bottom of the harbour schemes.  Under the act it became a [[Crime|criminal offence]] for any person to make a [[company]] or [[Trust (Law) non-USA|trust]] unable to pay tax debts ([[Income tax in Australia|income tax]], [[sales tax]], etc.), or to aid or abet any person or company doing so.  The act thus caught both those in the schemes and the promoters of such schemes.  It made it unnecessary to go through the crime of [[Fraud|defrauding]] the Commonwealth that had been so poorly handled at the Deputy Crown Solicitor above.

This act was controversial at the time, since [[tax avoidance]] was (and perhaps still is) regarded as something less than an outright [[crime]].  Tax matters might normally be addressed by closing a revenue loophole, the act instead treated bottom of the harbour schemes like [[fraud]]s.

===''Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Act 1982''===
The ''Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Act 1982'' went further, allowing for the recovery of tax avoided under bottom of the harbour tax schemes between 1 January 1972 and 4 December 1980.  The retrospectivity in this act was even more controversial than making the avoidance a crime.

[[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] [[John Howard]] said the normal reluctance against retrospectivity was "tempered by the competing consideration of overall perceptions as to the equity and fairness of our taxation system and the distribution of the tax burden." ([[Australian House of Representatives|House]], 23 September 1982).  [[Australian Senate|Senator]] [[Don Chipp]] thought the purpose noble but was strongly against retrospectivity, saying "I do not trust politicians to legislate retrospectively.  One of the few protections that the ordinary citizen has is that he knows the law." ([[Australian Senate|Senate]], 19 November 1982).

A '''bowl sink''', the first [[neologism|coined term]] for the more commonly known ''vessel sink'', is a free-standing [[sink]] that sits directly on the counter-top or [[furniture]] on which it is mounted. Originally invented by Meredith Wolf,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} a former [[Rhode Island]] resident, the [[Product (business)|product]] is now a worldwide decorative piece of [[art]] which serves as a sink and provides [[decor]].

This type of sink is produced by numerous firms, and is found in many [[hotel]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and [[home]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kohler.ca/planning/detail.jsp?aid=1138050337486.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12139">'''Cabotage''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|b|ə|t|ᵻ|dʒ|,_|-|t|ɑː|ʒ}}) is the [[transport]] of goods or passengers between two places in the same country by a transport operator from another country. It originally applied to shipping along coastal routes, port to port, but now applies to [[aviation]], [[railways]], and [[road transport]] as well.

'''Cabotage rights''' are the right of a company from one country to trade in another country. In aviation, it is the right to operate within the domestic borders of another country. Most countries do not permit aviation cabotage, and there are strict sanctions against it, for reasons of economic [[protectionism]], [[national security]], or [[public safety]]. One notable exception is the [[European Union]], whose Member States all grant cabotage rights to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/strategies/2001_white_paper_en.htm |title="European transport policy for 2010: time to decide" EU Commission White paper |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2005-12-01 |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927035247/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/strategies/2001_white_paper_en.htm |archivedate=2012-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

Cabotage originally meant simply [[Short sea shipping|coasting trade]], from the French ''caboter'', to travel by the coast. Its ultimate origin is uncertain. The air transport meaning is attested in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1st edition, 1888, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/25785 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==In shipping==
Cabotage laws apply to merchant ships in most countries that have a coastline so as to protect the domestic shipping industry from foreign competition, preserve domestically owned shipping infrastructure for national security purposes, and ensure safety in congested territorial waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adherence to the cabotage system|url=http://www.naiko-kaiun.or.jp/e/union/union10.html|publisher=Japan Federation of Coastal Shipping Associations|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the history of cabotage in UK law, see [[Navigation Acts]].

In the United States, the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920]] (Jones Act) requires that all goods transported by water between U.S. ports be carried on U.S.-flag ships, constructed in the United States, owned by U.S. citizens, and crewed by U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents. The [[Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886]] states that no foreign vessels shall transport passengers between ports or places in the United States, either directly or by way of a foreign port.

[[Indonesia]] implemented a cabotage policy in 2005 after previously allowing foreign-owned vessels to operate relatively freely within the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cabotage provides a big  boost to shipping industry |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/09/23/cabotage-provides-a-big-boost-shipping-industry.html|accessdate=26 December 2014|work=The Jakarta Post|date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Philippines, the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines (Republic Act No. 1937) which is also known as the Cabotage Law restricts [[coastwise trade]] or the transport of passengers and goods within the country, to vessels with Philippine registry which has to secure a coastwise license from the [[Maritime Industry Authority]]. After the passage of Foreign Ships Co-Loading Act or the Republic Act No. 10668 in 2015, foreign vessels with cargo intended to be exported out the country may dock in multiple ports in the country before transiting to a foreign port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond Republic Act No. 10668: Policy Considerations to Improve Coastwise Trade|url=http://industry.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Beyond-Republic-Act-No-10668-Policy-Considerations-to-Improve-Coastwise-Trade.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2017|publisher=Sector Planning Bureau of the Department of Trade and Industry|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the EU, rights to cabotage in newly-admitted Member States (in particular, Greece, Spain and Portugal) were restricted;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomsburyprofessional.com/uk/exceptions-from-eu-free-movement-law-9781849466202/ EU derogations]&lt;/ref&gt; but this introductory provision was abandoned after criticism in the light of the Paros ferry disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greekislandhopping.com/Updates/updatepages/u_disaster.html Paros ferry disaster] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xbfGMxu6?url=http://www.greekislandhopping.com/Updates/updatepages/u_disaster.html |date=2011-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hague–Visby Rules]], a convention which imposes duties on maritime carriers, apply only to "carriage of goods by sea between ports in two different states", and thus do not apply to cabotage shipping.&lt;ref&gt;Hague-Visby rules, Article X&lt;/ref&gt; However, section 1(3) of the UK [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971]] declares that the Rules "shall have effect ... where the port of shipment is a port in the United Kingdom, whether or not the carriage is between ports in two different States ...".

==In passenger aviation==
Cabotage rights remain rare in passenger aviation. The [[Convention on International Civil Aviation|Chicago Convention]] prohibits member states from granting cabotage on an exclusive basis, which has limited the availability of cabotage as a bargaining chip in bilateral aviation agreement negotiations.&lt;ref name="havel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Havel|first1=Brian F.|title=The Principles and Practice of International Aviation Law|date=31 March 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107020528|pages=50–53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8H2AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;ots=ShuKdGSAP2&amp;dq=chile%20cabotage&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cabotage is not granted under most [[open skies]] agreements.

===European Union===
Carriers licensed under EU law are permitted to engage in cabotage in any EU member state, with some limitations.&lt;ref name="havel"&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/road/haulage/cabotage_en "Cabotage"] European Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ryanair]], [[easyJet]], [[Vueling]], [[Wizz Air]], and [[Aer Lingus]] have bases and operate domestic services outside their home countries.

===Australia and New Zealand===
The [[Closer Economic Relations]] agreement allows Australian air carriers to fly domestically and internationally from [[New Zealand]] and vice versa. An Australian carrier, [[Jetstar]] (a [[Qantas]] subsidiary), flies domestic routes within New Zealand. [[Air New Zealand]] offers one international destination from Australia outside New Zealand, flying between [[Sydney]], Australia and [[Rarotonga]] of the [[Cook Islands]]. Previously, [[Jetconnect|Qantas Jetconnect]],  [[Pacific Blue Airlines|Pacific Blue]] (a [[Virgin Australia]] subsidiary) and [[Ansett New Zealand]] were Australian-owned airlines based in New Zealand that operated domestic New Zealand services.

Australia also permits foreign-owned airlines incorporated under Australian law (such as [[Tiger Airways Australia]] and the domestic arm of [[Virgin Australia]]) to operate on domestic routes, although it prohibits such airlines from operating international routes as Australian flag carriers.&lt;ref name="havel" /&gt;

===Chile===
[[Chile]] has the most liberal cabotage rules in the world, enacted in 1979, which allow foreign airlines to operate domestic flights, conditional upon reciprocal treatment for Chilean carriers in the foreign airline's country. This unusual regime is partly due to Chile's geographical need for air service, and partly to incentivize liberalization in other countries amid the international expansion of its flag carrier [[LATAM Chile]], which now has major operations in many other Latin American countries.&lt;ref name="havel" /&gt; Like Australia, Chile allows foreign companies to set up Chilean subsidiaries to offer domestic flights in Chile, regardless of reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005DC0406:EN:NOT |title=Communication from the Commission – Strengthening aviation relations with Chile |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other examples===

Before 1991, [[Lufthansa]] was prohibited from flying to [[West Berlin]], so [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]], [[British Airways]], and [[Air France]] operated the routes between [[West Germany]] and West Berlin. For a short time in the late 1980s, [[Trans World Airlines]] also flew between then-West Germany and West Berlin. During this time, Pan&amp;nbsp;Am flew to Tegel, in Berlin, from [[Munich-Riem Airport]] (now closed) and Frankfurt. Air France flew from [[Düsseldorf]]. British Airways flew from [[Münster]]-[[Osnabrück]], [[Hannover]], and some other cities.

In 2003&amp;ndash;2004, the [[United States Department of Transportation]] authorized [[Polynesian Airlines]] to provide temporary cabotage service in [[American Samoa]] after the existing US flag carrier ceased operations, one of very few instances where the US has granted cabotage rights in an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cabotage definition and standards for emergency exemption|url=http://www.doi.gov/oia/igia/2011/upload/20-AviationCabotageDOT.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October&amp;nbsp;2007, the [[United Kingdom]] granted [[Singapore]] carriers the right to fly domestic UK&amp;nbsp;routes as part of an [[open skies]] agreement, which also allows British carriers to fly to any city from Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/303608/1/.html |title=Channelnewsasia.com |publisher=Channelnewsasia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reciprocal cabotage rights exist by treaty between New Zealand and Brunei and between the People's Republic of China and Albania.&lt;ref name="havel" /&gt;

The "modified [[freedoms of the air|sixth freedom]]" refers to the right to carry passengers between two points in country A through a hub in country B; for instance, a Boston-Toronto-Seattle itinerary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vasigh|first1=Bijan|title=Introduction to Air Transport Economics: From Theory to Applications|date=2008|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|pages=156–157|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzPekWiS9I0C&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;ots=Abr6R5Ihxl&amp;dq=qantas%20new%20york%20cabotage&amp;pg=PA157#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such services are currently considered to constitute cabotage and are not permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Canada's new government delivers greater Air Travel choice through Open Skies agreement with the United States|publisher=[[Government of Canada]]|date=12 March 2007|url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=283149|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the United States fined [[Asiana Airlines]] for selling tickets from the mainland US to [[Guam]] and [[Saipan]] via Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Compart|first1=Andrew|title=DOT fines Asiana for violating cabotage laws|url=http://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Airline-News/DOT-fines-Asiana-for-violating-cabotage-laws/|accessdate=26 December 2014|work=Travel Weekly|date=31 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tag rights===

Certain airlines operate services within a foreign country without the right to carry local traffic. For instance, [[Qantas]] operates service between New York and Los Angeles solely for use by international connecting passengers. Such services are not generally considered to be cabotage.

The '''Church of the Most Precious Blood''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[parish]] located in [[New York City]]. The parish is under the authority of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|Archdiocese of New York]], and is the National Shrine Church of [[San Gennaro]]. Located on [[Baxter Street]] with an additional entrance on [[Mulberry Street (Manhattan)|Mulberry Street]], the Church of the Most Precious Blood is part of [[Manhattan]]'s [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]] neighborhood.

==History==
The parish of the Most Precious Blood was established in 1888 as a National Parish to serve the rapidly growing number of Italian immigrants in Lower Manhattan. Building of the church was begun by the [[Scalabrini Fathers]] around 1891. The Scalabrini Order built the foundation but ran out of funding.  The [[Franciscans]] then took over the parish and completed the church building in 1904. &lt;ref name=osp/&gt; 

During the [[Feast of San Gennaro]], which is held yearly in September, a celebratory [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] is held at the church on the last Saturday of the festival. After the Mass, a statue of San Gennaro is taken from its home within the church on a procession through the streets of Little Italy. Most Precious Blood is home to several vibrant religious societies in addition to the Figli di San Gennaro, including: the Community of Sant Egidio, and the San Angelo Society.&lt;ref name=osp/&gt; Besides the strong Italian tradition, the Vietnamese congregation has also grown in recent years. The Church is home to the Vietnamese Arts and Learning Cultural Center.

The Saint Rocco of Potenza Society was originally founded in 1889 at the now demolished [[St. Joachim's Church (Manhattan)|St. Joachim's Church]] on Roosevelt Street. It then moved to [[St. Joseph Church, Chinatown (Manhattan)|St. Joseph Church]] on Monroe Street, but with the merger in 2015 of St. Joseph's with the [[Church of the Transfiguration, Roman Catholic (Manhattan)|Church of the Transfiguration]] on Mott Street, the Society is now based at the Shrine Church of the Most Precious Blood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stroccosociety.com/society.html Saint Rocco Society of Potenza]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Due to manpower shortages, in March 2014, the Franciscans withdrew from Most Precious Blood and it came under diocesan administration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/priest-celebrates-mass-precious-blood-church-article-1.1708612 Sandoval, Edgar. "Franciscan priest celebrates last Mass at Little Italy's Most Precious Blood Church", ''Daily News'', March 3, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the church became part of the parish of [[St. Patrick's Old Cathedral]]. 

During the [[Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy]], from 8 December 2015, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, to 20 November 2016, the Feast of Christ the King, was one of the sites of the [[Holy door|Holy doors]].&lt;ref name=osp&gt;[https://oldcathedral.org/shrine-church-of-the-most-precious-blood "Shrine Church of the Most Precious Blood", The Basilica of Old St. Patrick's Cathedral]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The church was designed by [[Schickel &amp; Ditmars|William Schickel &amp; Company]], who provided an Italian Franciscan style structure. The marble main and side altars are by Borgia Marble Works of New York. The interior is decorated in Neapolitan Baroque style. [[Donatus Buongiorno]] created thirty oil painting murals for the walls and ceiling. The building was renovated in 1995 by the Gargiulo Brothers Construction Company of Mount Vernon, to repair damage suffered from water leakage and general disrepair. The Church was re-consecrated by [[John O'Connor (cardinal)|Archbishop John Cardinal O'Connor]] on February 7, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://oldcathedral.org/history-of-the-church-amp-community "History of the Church &amp; Community", The Basilica of Old St. Patrick's Cathedral]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycago.org/Organs/NYC/html/MostPreciousBlood.html "Church of the Most Precious Blood", NYC AGO]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Claudio Strunz''' (born December 13, 1971) is an Argentine thrash metal drummer. He has worked in Heinkel, [[Hermética]], [[Malón (band)|Malón]] and Simbiosis.

==Biography==
Claudio Strunz, born in [[La Tablada]], began his career in Heinkel, a band that would be renamed [[Jeriko]]. The band's rehearsal room was located in the [[Belgrano, Buenos Aires|Belgrano]] neighbourhood, which was very distant, so he created a new one at his home. [[El Reloj]] hired this rehearsal room as well. He created later a new one in [[Mataderos]], which was hired by the thrash metal band [[Hermética]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/no/12-596-2003-03-03.html|title= Sin vecinos cerca, por favor|trans-title=No neighbors allowed, please|language= Spanish|author= Miguel Mora|date= February 27, 2003|work= |publisher= Página 12|accessdate=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played with that band during tests when the drummer [[Tony Scotto]] was absent. As a result, when Scotto left the band Strunz was selected as the new drummer. He joined the band in 1991, just in time for the recording of the LP ''[[Ácido Argentino]]'', and stayed with the band since then. Hermética received a [[Music recording sales certification|golden record]] for the sales of ''Ácido Argentino'', and a second one for the 1994 CD ''[[Víctimas del Vaciamiento]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Blumetti, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Hermética broke up in 1994, in controversial circumstances. Bassist [[Ricardo Iorio]] created a new band, [[Almafuerte (band)|Almafuerte]], with new musicians. Strunz, guitarist [[Antonio Romano (musician)|Antonio Romano]] and singer [[Claudio O'Connor]], the remaining members of the band, created the band [[Malón (band)|Malón]] with a new bassist, Carlos Kuadrado. The new band had a [[thrash metal]] style similar to Hermética. They recorded two studio CDs and one live CD. Strunz made a guest appearance in the song "Ardiendo en el cielo" of "Tierra Violada", the first CD of Jeriko. He was the producer of the CD, as well as with their second CD, "Tensiones".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/no/12-5498-2011-06-14.html|title= Cromañón frenó al metal|trans-title=Cromañon stopped metal|language= Spanish|author= Juan Ignacio Provéndola|date= June 9, 2011|work= |publisher= Página 12|accessdate=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malón broke up in 1998, after the departure of O'Connor. Strunz created the [[grunge]] band ''Simbiosis'', which had little success. With his previous experience, he created "Asbury Park", a complex of rehearsal rooms. He tried to reunite Malón with Romano and Kuadrado; O'Connor refused to join them. The band broke up again, and Strunz claimed the copyright over the name of the band, forbidding it to continue without him. The band reunited again in 2011, this time with all the original members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1433294-malon-vuelve-hermetica-aun-no|title= Malón vuelve; Hermética... aún no|trans-title=Malón returns; Hermética... not yet|language= Spanish|author= Sebastián Esposito|date= December 17, 2011|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Insolvency}}
'''Cross-border insolvency''' (sometimes called '''international insolvency''') regulates the treatment of financially distressed debtors where such debtors have assets or creditors in more than one country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insolvency in Private International Law|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|author=Ian Fletcher|edition=2nd|year=2005|isbn=978-0199262502}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, cross-border insolvency is more concerned with the [[insolvency]] of [[corporation|companies]] that operate in more than one country rather than [[bankruptcy]] of individuals.  Like traditional [[conflict of laws]] rules, cross-border insolvency focuses upon three areas: choice of law rules, jurisdiction rules and enforcement of judgment rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insolvency Law|publisher=Jordans|author=Andrew Keay and Peter Walton|edition=2nd|year=2011|page=385|isbn=978-1846611193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in relation to insolvency, the principal focus tends to be the recognition of foreign insolvency officials and their powers.

==Theories of cross-border insolvency==
There are, broadly, three approaches to the administration of cross-border insolvency:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insolvency Law|publisher=Jordans|author=Andrew Keay and Peter Walton|edition=2nd|year=2011|page=386|isbn=978-1846611193}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The territorial approach''', whereby each country exercises its own domestic insolvency laws in relation to all the debtor's property and all of the creditors located within its jurisdiction.  This approach does not recognise any extraterritorial dimension to insolvency law.
* '''The universalist approach''' (or ''universal approach''), whereby any cross-border insolvencies are administered pursuant to a single global insolvency regime, and all of the debtor's assets are distributed by a single insolvency office holder, regardless where the assets or claimants are located.
* '''Hybrid approach'''.  A number of hybrid approaches exist in theory or practice, including:
** [[Modified universalism]], whereby individual countries seek to identify the most relevant jurisdiction in which to conduct the proceedings, and all other states cooperate with and facilitate such proceedings (subject to limits of [[public policy]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jay Westbrook |date= |title=Global Solution to Multinational Default |url=http://test.iiiglobal.org/downloads/Insolvency%20Topics/Sovereign%20Insolvencies/18~_Global_Solution_to_Multinational_Default.pdf |journal=[[Michigan Law Review]] |year=2000 |volume=98 |page=2276 |doi=10.2307/1290306 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623122232/http://test.iiiglobal.org/downloads/Insolvency%20Topics/Sovereign%20Insolvencies/18~_Global_Solution_to_Multinational_Default.pdf |archivedate=23 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or
** Co-operative territorialism, which is broadly predicated on territorialist approach supplemented by multi-lateral conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lynn LoPucki |date= |title=Cooperation in International Bankruptcy: A Post-Universalist Approach |url=http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/research/cornell-law-review/upload/Lopucki.pdf |journal=[[Cornell Law Review]] |year=1999 |volume=86 |page=696 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The universalist approach remains largely a holistic ideal and, for the most part, countries are divided into those with a purely territorial approach, and those that apply some form of hybrid approach.

==Development==

Historically, most legal systems have developed on a territorial basis, and this is as true in relation to bankruptcy laws as other areas.  However, from an early stage there have been piecemeal attempts to develop cross-border cooperation in insolvency matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insolvency Law|publisher=Jordans|author=Andrew Keay and Peter Walton|edition=2nd|year=2011|page=387|isbn=978-1846611193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* In 1889 seven treaties were signed in Montevideo with the aim to harmonising [[private international law]] in the signatory states ([[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]] and [[Uruguay]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|jstor=742785|title=The Treaties of Montevideo (1889)|author=Wyndham Bewes|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of which related to the regulation of bankruptcies between member states.  The treaty was updated in 1930, and broadly provided for a system more closer to territorialism than universality, providing for multiple bankruptcy administrations in different states for multinational companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=f_yWaV_-_l4C&amp;pg=PT946&amp;lpg=PT946&amp;dq=Montevideo+Bankruptcy+Treaty&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D-jm4fRiV6&amp;sig=jibUcGANCJ2UJY03tYpmJyVIWFU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CPiIVfrIO4G2-QHt6YO4Dw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Montevideo%20Bankruptcy%20Treaty&amp;f=false|title=Principles of International Insolvency|author=Philip Wood|publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]]|location=29-080| year=2007 |isbn=9781847032102 |accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1933 Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden signed into law the [[Nordic Bankruptcy Convention]] which, although not a lengthy document, is still in force today and facilitates administration of cross border bankruptcies in the Scandinavia region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://test.iiiglobal.org/downloads/country%20resources/Norway/Articles/1~_Nordic_Bankruptcy.pdf|title=The Nordic Bankruptcy Convention - An Introduction|author=Carl Hugo Parment|date=|accessdate=23 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623141319/http://test.iiiglobal.org/downloads/country%20resources/Norway/Articles/1~_Nordic_Bankruptcy.pdf|archivedate=23 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1980s the [[International Bar Association]] published a model law, the Model International Insolvency Co-operation Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elizabeth Somers |date= |title=The Model International Insolvency Cooperation Act: An International Proposal for Domestic Legislation |url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1571&amp;context=auilr |journal=[[American University International Law Review]] |year=2011 |volume=6 |issue=4 |page=677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but ultimately this model was not adopted by any country and the attempt was unsuccessful.

But from a comparatively early stage [[common law]] jurisdictions recognised the desirability of ensuring that insolvency officers from different jurisdictions received the necessary support to enable the efficient administration of estates.  Under English law one of the earliest recorded cases was ''Solomons v Ross'' (1764) 1 H Bl 131n.  In that case a firm in the Netherlands was declared bankrupt and assignees were appointed.  An English creditor had brought [[garnishment|garnishee proceedings]] in England to attach certain sums owing to the Dutch firm but Bathurst J held that the bankruptcy had vested all the firm's assets (including debts owed by English debtors) in the Dutch assignees, and the English creditor had  to surrender the fruits of the garnishee proceedings and prove in the Dutch bankruptcy.  In ''Re African Farms'' 1906 TS 373 an English company with assets in the [[Transvaal Colony]] was in [[winding-up]] in England, and the Chief Justice of the Transvaal confirmed that the English [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] would be recognised and that "recognition which carries with it the active assistance of the court", and that active assistance could include: "A declaration, in effect, that the liquidator is entitled to deal with the Transvaal assets in the same way as if they were within the jurisdiction of the English courts, subject only to such conditions as the court may impose for the protection of local creditors, or in recognition of the requirements of our local laws."  In ''Galbraith v Grimshaw'' [1910] AC 508 [[Andrew Murray, 1st Viscount Dunedin|Lord Dunedin]] stated that there should be only one universal process of the distribution of a bankrupt's property and that, where such a process was pending elsewhere, the English courts should not let actions in its jurisdiction interfere with that process.&lt;ref&gt;"Now so far as the general principle is concerned it is quite consistent with the comity of nations that it should be a rule of international law that if the court finds that there is already pending a process of universal distribution of a bankrupt's effects it should not allow steps to be taken in its territory which would interfere with that process of universal distribution." at 513&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the first significant developments in relation to cross-border insolvency regimes which were widely adopted were (1) the UNCITRAL Model Law, and (2) the EC Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings 2000.

==Modern regimes==

Two current regimes for international insolvencies have been implemented on something wider than a regional basis: the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, and the EC Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings 2000.&lt;ref&gt;No 1346/2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Both regimes locate the ''centre of main interest'' (or "COMI") of the debtor.

===The UNCITRAL Model Law===
{{Main article|UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency}}
The [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]] adopted a model law relating to cross-border insolvency on 30 June 1997.&lt;ref name=uncitral&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/insolvency/1997Model.html|title=UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (1997)|publisher=UNCITRAL|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At present 46 jurisdictions have substantially implemented the Model Law into their domestic legislation, including a number of states with both significant economies and large volumes of cross border trade—such as the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, as well as leading emerging economies such as Mexico and [[South Africa]].

The basic concept of the Model Law is to establish what the "main proceedings" are in relation to any international insolvency.  All other proceedings are referred to as the "non-main proceedings".  The main proceedings are commenced where the debtor has its centre of main interest, or "COMI".&lt;ref name=uncitral /&gt;  Non-main proceedings may be commenced in any place where the debtor has a commercial establishment.  The Model Law does not require reciprocity between states, but focuses upon (i) ensuring that states give assistance to insolvency officials from other countries in relation to main proceedings and non-main proceedings, and (ii) eliminating preferences for local creditors over international ones.&lt;ref&gt;Model Law, Article 13, paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The following countries have substantially implemented the Model Law into their domestic legislation.&lt;ref name=Countries&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/insolvency/1997Model_status.html|title=Status - UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (1997)|publisher=UNCITRAL|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===EC Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings 2000===

{{Main article|Insolvency Regulation (EC) 1346/2000}}

The [[Regulation (European Union)|EC Regulation]] on Insolvency Proceedings 2000 was passed on 29 May 2000 and came into effect on 31 May 2002.&lt;ref name=ECReg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32000R1346|title=Council regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on insolvency proceedings|publisher=Eur-Lex|date=|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EC Regulation, as its name applies, operates between member states of the [[European Union]], and focuses upon creating a framework for the commencement of proceedings and for the automatic recognition and co-operation between the different member states.  Unusually for a European regulation, the EC Insolvency Regulation does not seek to harmonise insolvency laws between the different member states.

Like the UNCITRAL Model Law, the EC Regulation also employs the concept of a centre of main interest (or "COMI").  The definition of the COMI is left to member states in their implementation of the Regulation, but paragraph (13) of the preamble states: 'The "centre of main interests" should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of his interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties.'  If the COMI of an entity is outside of the European Union then the insolvency proceedings are not subject to the Regulation.&lt;ref&gt;''Re the Arena Corporation Ltd'' [2003] EWHC 3032 (Ch.), affirmed on appeal ([2004] EWCA Civ 371).&lt;/ref&gt;  In relation to [[corporation|companies]] there is a [[presumption (law)|presumption]] that the registered office is the COMI of the company, but this presumption can be (and often is) [[rebuttal|rebutted]].&lt;ref&gt;''Re AIM Underwriting Agencies'' [2004] EWHC Civ 2114; ''Re TXU Europe German Finance BV'' [2005] BCC 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EC Regulation does not define insolvency, but it does define insolvency proceedings as "...collective insolvency proceedings which entail the partial or total divestment of a debtor and the appointment of a liquidator."&lt;ref&gt;Article 1(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  Article 3 divides proceedings into main proceedings and territorial proceedings.  Main proceedings are accorded extraterritorial effect throughout the European Union.  One of the concerns expressed in relation to the EC Regulation is that (other than a reference to the [[European Court of Justice]]) it provides no mechanism for determining which set of proceedings are the main proceedings if two or more jurisdictions claim their proceedings are the main proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd'' (Case C-341/04), [2006] ECR 1-701&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insolvency Law|publisher=Jordans|author=Andrew Keay and Peter Walton|edition=2nd|year=2011|page=400|isbn=978-1846611193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of conflict==

In any attempt to harmonise or facilitate cross-border administration of insolvent companies, national insolvency regimes can take widely divergent approaches on certain key points:

* '''[[Secured creditor]]s.'''  Whether or not bankruptcy proceedings operate as a stay upon the enforcement of secured creditor's rights as a fundamental determinant in relation to the manner of conduct of any proceedings
* '''Corporate rehabilitation regimes.''' Bankruptcy systems predicated on trying to rehabilitate companies (such as [[Chapter 11]] in the United States, or [[administration order]]s in the United Kingdom) are fundamentally different in intent and effect to winding-up regimes that seeks to liquidate companies and distribute the proceeds to creditors.
* '''Set-off rights.''' Whilst certain countries allow creditors who have mutual claims with the debtor to [[set-off (law)|set-off]] those claims in full, others require the creditors to pay any sums owed to the debtor in full before claiming in the proceedings.  Within jurisdictions that do permit set-off, variations may arise as to whether set-off must be on an individual or group basis.&lt;ref&gt;In an insolvent liquidation, banks who provide loan finance are often key creditors. Similarly, most companies also have cash-at-bank as one of their assets.  The ability of banks to set-off those sums can be a material factor.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Héctor Daniel Lalín''', generally known as '''Daniel Lalín''',&lt;ref name=cron&gt;{{cite web| title =Lalin se asocia a una empresa china para entrar al negocio petrolero| work =Cronista| date =Nov 9, 2006| url = http://www.cronista.com/impresageneral/Lalin-se-asocia-a-una-empresa-china-para-entrar-al-negocio-petrolero-20060912-0072.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] businessman and accountant with close ties to the ruling [[Nestor Kirchner|Kirchner family]]. He was the president of Racing Club, a professional sports club based in the Avellaneda district of [[Buenos Aires]], from 1995 to 1999, and is a major figure in the Argentine [[oil]] business.

==Early life and education==
Born around 1950, Lalín was a member of [[Montonero]], the youth wing of the [[Peron]]ist left. In 1999, as head of Racing, he described himself as still being “ideologically” a member of Montonero, despite all his wealth and success.&lt;ref name=old&gt;{{cite web| title =Sigo siendo un Montonero| work =Ole| url = http://old.ole.com.ar/diario/1999/01/06/r-03501b.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In the mid 1970s, Lalín was [[Dean of the Faculty]] of [[Economics]] at the [[National University of Lomas de Zamora]].&lt;ref name=old/&gt; He later served as treasurer of the city of Buenos Aires during the administration of [[Carlos Grosso]] (1989–92).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pagina12.com.ar/1999/99-10/99-10-08/PAG27.HTM&lt;/ref&gt; During his term as city treasurer, Lalín and his old friend [[Daniel Peralta]], who at the time was the director of Argentina’s central bank and a close friend of Argentinian president Néstor Kirchner, won [[oil exploration]] leases from the Kirchner government, despite not having any experience in that field required under Argentine law.&lt;ref name=guard&gt;{{cite web| last =Nelson| first =Jerry| title =Argentina President Mulls Resignation| work =Guardian Liberty Voice| date =Mar 6, 2014| url = http://guardianlv.com/2014/03/argentina-president-mulls-resignation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bloom&gt;{{cite web| last =Smith| first =Michael; Pablo Gonzales| title =Argentina Oil’s Bonanza Helping Too Few Led by Political Friends| work =Bloomberg| date =Mar 5, 2014| url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-06/argentina-oil-s-bonanza-helping-too-few-led-by-political-friends.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to his election as president of Racing Club, Lalín also pursued a “successful career in [[real estate]] and construction.”&lt;ref name="racing"/&gt;

===Racing Club===
Lalín was president of Racing Club, also known as [[Racing Club de Avellaneda]] or simply as Racing, from 1995 to 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asteriscos.tv/noticia-15677.html&lt;/ref&gt; The club was the favorite of President Néstor Kirchner. During his years at Racing Club, according to one source, Lalín became part of a social circle that included “Menemistas” [[Daniel Vila]] and [[José Luis Manzano]] and “‘K’ front men” [[Cristóbal López (businessman)|Cristóbal López]] and [[Lázaro Báez]].&lt;ref name="pcr"/&gt;

During Lalín’s tenure, Racing Club experienced a financial crisis. Some sources described him as the latest in a series of incompetent and/or corrupt presidents of Racing Club, suggesting that his purchase of several expensive top-level players precipitated the crisis.&lt;ref name=racing&gt;http://www.newsweek.com/racing-against-time-165010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taringa.net"&gt;http://www.taringa.net/posts/deportes/4344852/Daniel-Lalin-Lo-primero-que-haria-en-Racing-es-r.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Newsweek'', the major factor in Racing Club’s financial decline was the fact that it had, under Lalín, “stopped developing young talent in favor of recruiting high-priced stars – often using peculiar financing.” ''Newsweek'' noted that Lalín himself was Racing’s biggest creditor, having “pumped $2.5 million of his own money into Racing to keep it afloat, sometimes in exchange for rights to players.”&lt;ref name=racing/&gt;

In 1998, Lalín, a priest, and some 500 fans took part in an elaborate “[[exorcism]]” ceremony with the intention of banishing evil spirits from Racing Club.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/87846-con-una-fiesta-racing-quiere-renovar-la-fe&lt;/ref&gt; “We are uniting [[Roman Catholicism]] with Racingism,” Lalín explained. “It is an act of faith. The same faith displayed by the fans who stoically go to the stadium every Sunday.”&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9802/15/argentina.exorcism/&lt;/ref&gt;

Lalín filed for [[bankruptcy]] on behalf of Racing Club on July 10, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201403/55907-daniel-lalin-si-blanco-se-quiere-juntar-conmigo-no-hay-problema.html&lt;/ref&gt; When he announced the bankruptcy, fans reacted with outrage. Some hurled stones at him,&lt;ref name="racing"/&gt; and one person threw a drum at him, causing an injury to his nose. More than 1500 fans “called for his head.”&lt;ref&gt;http://edant.clarin.com/diar io/1999/03/05/r-05301d.ht m&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/mar/13/newsstory.sport16&lt;/ref&gt; He defended the bankruptcy, calling it “the best way out.”&lt;ref name="pagina12.com.ar"&gt;http://www.pagina12.com.ar/1998/98-07/98-07-20/bue05.htm&lt;/ref&gt; On July 13, 1998, Judge [[Enrique Gorostegui]] officially declared Racing bankrupt.&lt;ref name=litoral&gt;http://www.ellitoral.com/index.php/id_um/36326&lt;/ref&gt; On March 4, 1999, the Court of Appeals of [[La Plata]] ordered the immediate liquidation of all of Racing’s assets. Racing, it was announced, had “ceased to exist.”&lt;ref name=litoral/&gt; On May 5, 1999, Lalín and his executive committee submitted their resignations.&lt;ref name=litoral/&gt; At the time Lalín left the club, it had $62 million in debts, 200 judgments against it, and 3 million pesos in [[lien]]s.&lt;ref name="pcr"/&gt; After the club went bankrupt, it was bailed out by the Kirchner government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Cabot| first =Diego| title =Llegaron los nuevos dueños del petróleo| work =La Nacion| date =Jan 6, 2008| url = http://www.lanacion.com.ar/976601-llegaron-los-nuevos-duenos-del-petroleo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 1999, prosecutor [[Manuel Barreiro]] issued arrest warrants for Lalín and former Racing presidents [[Osvaldo Otero]] and [[Juan De Stéfano]] in connection with charges of mismanagement.&lt;ref&gt;http://old.ole.com.ar/diario/1999/10/22/r-01501d.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Lalín was taken into custody, and he and De Stéfano spent 14 days in detention in a police station in Lanús.&lt;ref name=litoral/&gt; The charges against him were dropped and he was released. In November 2000, De Stéfano claimed on a [[Fox Sports]] program that during the time he and Lalín had been in jail together, Lalín had told him that the dismissal of charges against him, Lalín, had “cost him 200 thousand dollars.” De Stéfano described Lalín’s acquittal as an example of the importance of political favors in “the city of Buenos Aires, the palace of corruption.” Otero said of Lalín that high-level “radical leaders” were “doing everything possible to save him.”&lt;ref&gt;http://old.clarin.com.ar/diario/2000/11/02/d-01001.htm&lt;/ref&gt; De Stéfano blamed both Lalín and Otero for the bankruptcy of Racing Club, which he called “a scam, a lie, immoral, and a disgrace.” De Stéfano claimed that “the club is run by scoundrels,” and urged the judge in the case to conduct a serious investigation that would drive “the Mafia” out of Racing management.&lt;ref name="pagina12.com.ar"/&gt;

Lalín himself also declared personal bankruptcy in 1998 following a request by former Racing coach [[Carlos Babington]], to whom he owed $600,000. They had worked out a payment deal but Lalín had reneged on it. Critics claimed that he owed $8 million and accused him of fraudulent management. It was noted that he actually had “nothing to his name” and held all his assets through companies. “Fiscally he doesn’t exist,” an attorney stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Avallaned| first =Daniel| title =Daniel Lalín y esa palabra, quiebra| work =Clarin| date =| url = http://edant.clarin.com/diario/1998/10/15/r-00801d.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Racing Club===
After leaving Racing Club, Lalín entered the oil business and became very successful in a short period.

A 2001 [[U.S. Senate]] report stated that Lalín had engaged in player transactions through Mercado Abierto SA and MA – House Exchange, both subsidiaries of the [[Cayman Islands]]-based Grupo Mercado Abierto, which was owned by three Lalín associates, [[Miguel Iribarne]], [[Aldo Ducler]], and [[Hector Scasserra]]. The Senate report linked Group Mercado Abierto to the [[Juarez drug cartel]] and identified it as a vehicle for laundering bribes and drug-trafficking profits. When Lalín filed a lawsuit in 2004 in [[Uruguay]] against businessman [[Adrián Troche]], on a matter involving player transactions, only to withdraw the suit shortly thereafter, a Uruguayan news source suggested that he had probably withdrawn it because he realized that he would have had to explain to the Uruguayan judiciary why his payments in the transactions in question had been made through Grupo Mercado Abierto.

Also in 2004, it was reported that there were “very strong indications” that player transfers and other activities by Lalín were tied up with money laundering in Uruguayan football. In addition, it was reported that funds paid to Lalín as part of several player transactions had not ended up in the club treasury but rather in Mercado Abierto SA and MA – House Rates accounts at the [[Bank of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espectador.com/ sociedad/20083/denuncian- maniobras-contables-con-tra nsferencias-de-futbolistas&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ir21&gt;{{cite web| title =Lalín no quiso responder la denuncia del narcobanco| work =LaRed 21| date =Jun 23, 2004| url = http://www.lr21.com.uy/deportes/145390-lalin-no-quiso-responder-la-denuncia-del-narcobanco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One 2004 report indicated that Lalín had engaged in business operations that enabled him to skirt hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax payments.&lt;ref name=ir21/&gt; Another report the same year stated that Lalín had “evaded nearly two million dollars in taxes.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espectador.com/sociedad/20083/denuncian-maniobras-contables-con-transferencias-de-futbolistas&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, it was reported that Lalín was “seeking his place in la Argentina K” – in other words, in the business circles surrounding the Kirchners. Through a holding company, Lalín Global Group, he closed a deal in that year with the Chinese firm JHP, which had subsidiaries in [[Libya]] and [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref name=cron/&gt; One source states that Lalín, via his firm Maxipetrol-Petroleros de Occidente, turned himself into “a local intermediary of the two Chinese corporations JHP International Petroleum Engineering and New Times Energy Corporation” and became “a pivot in the Chinese appropriation of [Argentinian] oil.”&lt;ref name=pcr&gt;http://www.pcr.org.ar/nota/política-nacional/salta-petr%C3%B3leo-usurpaci%C3%B3n-desmonte-y-represi%C3%B3n&lt;/ref&gt;

In association with JHP, Lalín formed [[Oxipetrol]], a multinational oil exploration firm,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perfil.com/politica/Empresarios-cercanos-al-Gobierno-entran-al-negocio-del-petroleo-con-la-venia-oficial-20070130-0064.html&lt;/ref&gt; in April 2006. The plan was for the Argentinian partners to contribute familiarity with the local market, while the Chinese contributed scientific expertise. It was reported in that year that Lalín had other Chinese business contacts, and that he was serving as the regional representative of Shenzhen Our International Technology &amp; Science, a developer of medical technology.&lt;ref name=cron/&gt; One article described him as an “intermediary in the Kircherist ‘strategic association’ with Chinese monopolies.”&lt;ref name=pcr/&gt;

Another 2006 report identified Lalín and his friend José Luis Manzano Menem, a former Interior Minister, as “two of the leading exponents of an unexpected transformation in the energy world” on account of their large investments in oil exploration. Involved with them in these activities, it was reported, were “K businessman” Cristóbal López and [[Roberto Monti]]. (“K businessman,” “K politician,” and similar labels are Argentinian shorthand for persons with close connections to the Kirchner regime.) The four men were described as “emerging national oil bourgeoisie.”&lt;ref name=pag1229&gt;{{cite web| last =Candelaresi| first =Cledis| title =Lalín y Manzano, nueva burguesía petrolera| work =Pagina12| url = http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/economia/2-75340-2006-10-29.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same article stated that Lalín and media entrepreneur [[Daniel Vila]] had jointly made “inroads into the territory of ‘K governor’ [[Julio Cobos]]” (who at the time was governor of Mendoza province), together proffering a successful bid for the firm Aguas de Mendoza and an unsuccessful bid for the energy company Edemsa.&lt;ref name=pag1229/&gt;

A 2007 article described Oxipetrol as performing successfully.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cronista.com/impresageneral/Lalin-debuta-en-el-mercado-petrolero-20070125-0043.html&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, South American Hedge Fund LLC, a subsidiary of Arizona-based Delta Mutual, Inc., paid the Kirchner administration $1.7 million for drilling rights to oil fields owned by Oxipetrol. The next year, Lalín’s friend Peralta and Peralta’s wife, Laura, bought a controlling interest in Delta, through which they sold and purchased oil leases. In 2007, Oxipetrol’s oil fields were valued at $2.7 million; two years later, New Times Group Holdings, based in [[Hong Kong]], bought 60 percent of two of the oil fields for $270 million. In November 2012, Peralta and his wife, Laura, were found shot to death in their home in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]]. Although the deaths were ruled a murder-suicide, some individuals close to the couple suggested that their death was connected to their oil activities.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;

It was reported in 2008 that Lalín was still hoping to regain control of Racing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asteriscos.tv/n oticia-15677.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.don-patadon.c om/2008/12/daniel-lalin-q uiero-volver-ser_4074.htm l&lt;/ref&gt; When he sought re-election to the presidency of the club, he received only about 500 votes, which he considered “a hard blow to his pride.”&lt;ref name=24con&gt;{{cite web| last =Rodriguez| first =Gaston| title =Daniel Lalín: "Haría un gran esfuerzo para lleva a la `bruja Verón´ a Racing"| work =Conurbano| url = http://24con.infonews.com/conurbano/nota/33724-Daniel-Lal%EDn-Har%EDa-un-gran-esfuerzo-para-lleva-a-la-bruja-Ver%F3n%B4-a-Racing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lalín said in March 2013 that he was still “very involved in the politics of Racing,” that he talked frequently with “the people at Racing,” and that it was hurtful to him that some people believe he had “stolen” from Racing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OENexZoFU0I&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013 he reiterated his desire to resume control of Racing and harshly criticized its current management.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infobae.com/2013/09/03/1506377-daniel-lalin-racing-es-un-delirio-debe-mas-180-millones-pesos&lt;/ref&gt;

“I had a lot of luck,” Lalín stated in an interview from 2010, referring to a profit of $63 million he had earned the previous year.&lt;ref name="taringa.net"/&gt; A 2014 report by ''Bloomberg News'' identified Lalín as one of several Kirchner intimates who had benefited from the illegal awarding of oil leases. Lalín acknowledged that he had obtained the leases through contacts. “Contacts are everything in Peronism,” he said. “Oil experience helps, but the contacts are what matters.”&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

==Personal life==
As of 2008, Lalín was involved with a personal trainer named Laura.&lt;ref name=24con/&gt;

He left the studio in 2009.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

===Warhorse Studios===
In 2011, Vávra co-founded [[Warhorse Studios]]. He is currently working on ''[[Kingdom Come: Deliverance]]'', a [[role-playing video game]] that uses [[Cry Engine 3]] set in a medieval-themed open world environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-01-21-i-do-care-for-a-next-gen-medieval-rpg-with-no-fantasy|title=I do care for a next-gen medieval RPG with no fantasy • Eurogamer.net|date=22 January 2014|work=Eurogamer.net|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The game was set to be delivered in Q4 2015 through episodic iterations, and was successfully funded via [[Kickstarter]].

On 9 November 2012, Vávra led a protest against the arrest of I. Buchta and M. Pezlar, Bohemia Interactive ''[[Arma 3]]'' developers arrested during their holiday on the Greek island [[Lemnos]]. The protest was held outside the Greek embassy in Prague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-29-jailed-arma-3-devs-send-letter-from-prison-as-czech-protests-escalate|title=Jailed ArmA 3 devs send letter from prison as Czech protests escalate • Eurogamer.net|date=29 November 2012|work=Eurogamer.net|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April 2015, Vávra  ([[Warhorse Studios]]) announced that ''[[Kingdom Come: Deliverance]]'' was delayed until Summer 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kingdom Come: Deliverance delayed until summer 2016|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-04-02-kingdom-come-deliverance-delayed-until-2016|website=Eurogamer.net|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the game was later delayed until 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kingdom Come: Deliverance delayed until next year|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-23-kingdom-come-deliverance-delayed-until-next-year|website=Eurogamer.net|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released on February 13, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kingdom Come: Deliverance release date, platforms and gameplay news|url=https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/new-product/game/kingdom-come-deliverance-news-3637546/|website=Tech Advisor|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political views ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5961">'''David Low Dodge''' (June 14, 1774 – April 23, 1852) helped to establish the [[New York Peace Society]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Brock (historian)|Peter Brock]], ''Pacifism in the United States: from the colonial era to the First World War''. Princeton University Press, 1968 (p. 459-461).&lt;/ref&gt; and was a founder of the [[New York Bible Society]] and the [[New York Tract Society]].

== Life and career ==
David Low Dodge was born in [[Brooklyn, Connecticut]] on June 14, 1774.&lt;ref name=DodgeFamily&gt;[http://www.dodgefamily.org/Biographies/D/DavidLowDodge.shtml The Dodge Family Association: "David Low Dodge, Jr."] retrieved January 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were David Dodge and Mary (Stuart) Earl.   She was said to have been the daughter of a Scottish nobleman, perhaps connected with the House of Stuart, pretenders to the British throne, although this has never been confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodge|first1=Phyllis B.|title=Tales of the Phelps Dodge Family|date=1987|publisher=New York Historical Society|location=New York|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She had previously been married to William Earl who died of yellow fever fighting for the British during an attack on [[Battle of Havana (1762)|Havana in 1762]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodge|first1=Phyllis B.|title=Tales of the Phelps Dodge Family|date=1987|publisher=New York Historical Society|location=New York|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;    During the War of Independence, Mary's two children from this first marriage, William and Jesse Earl, were both killed on active service.  Dodge later wrote that "these events almost destroyed my mother's nervous system."

From the age of seven to fourteen, except two months of district school in winter, Dodge was working on a farm in [[Hampton, Connecticut]].  He was a teacher at the age of nineteen, first in community schools then in private ones. He later began selling dry goods in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. He also managed the first [[cotton]] factory built in [[Connecticut]], near the town of [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]]. In the early 19th century he relocated to New York City.

On June 7, 1798, he married Sarah Cleveland (1780–1862), the daughter of Rev. Aaron Cleveland (1744–1815) and Abiah Hyde (c1750–1788).&lt;ref name=DodgeFamily /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sJpIAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=Aaron+Cleveland+porter&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=b9L6UPCfFeuM0QGrr4DIBQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dodge&amp;f=false The Descendants of John Porter of Windsor, Conn. 1635-9, Volume 1] retrieved January 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Aaron Cleveland was the son of [[Aaron Cleveland]] who was also a clergyman.  In David Low Dodge's autobiography, ''Memorial of Mr. David L. Dodge, consisting of an autobiography, prepared at the request and for the use of his children; with a few selections from his writings'', published 1854, pages 53-54, he writes that Sarah's father was a hatter from Hadden Connecticut, born 1744.  He entered the ministry late in life holding office in Orange County, Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt; They had seven children including [[William E. Dodge]] and [[Elizabeth Clementine Stedman]]. He was also the great-grandfather of [[Grace Hoadley Dodge]]. Sarah Cleveland was great-aunt of [[Grover Cleveland]] 22nd and 24th President of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prominent Families of New York|date=1897|publisher=Historical Company|location=New York|page=183 William Earl Dodge|url=https://archive.org/stream/prominentfamilie00week#page/182/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Low Dodge is credited with publishing the first pamphlets in America that expressed the futility of war.  ''The Mediator's Kingdom not of this World'', was published in 1809, his second, ''War Inconsistent with the Religion of Jesus Christ'', was completed in 1812, two years before the publication of [[Noah Worcester]]'s ''Solemn Review of the Custom of War'' - a work that has since overshadowed Dodge's contribution.  Dodge considered forming the first peace society in 1812, but the timing was inappropriate due to the war with Great Britain.  However, in August 1815 the [[New York Peace Society]] was formed with Dodge as the president.  This was the first in the world - four months before Noah Worcester formed the Massachusetts Peace Society, and a year before the English Peace society was formed. In 1829 he assisted in organizing the new national society, and presided at its first annual meeting.  He was a member of the board of directors, and later a life director, maintaining his connection with the society until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mead|first1=Edwin D.|title=WAR INCONSISTENT   WITH THE RELIGION OF JESUS CHRIST|date=1905|publisher=PUBLISHED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL UNION  GINN &amp; COMPANY|location=Boston|page=Introduction|url=http://www.nonresistance.org/docs_htm/~War_Inconsistent/War_Inconsistent.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on April 23, 1852 in [[New York City]].

His great-great-great-grandsons are businesspeople [[Frederick R. Koch]], [[Charles Koch]], [[David Koch]], and [[Bill Koch (businessman)|Bill Koch]].

'''David Woo''' is the Head of Global Interest Rates, Foreign Exchange, Emerging Market Fixed Income &amp; Economics Research at [[Bank of America|Bank of America Merrill Lynch]], where he researches the world financial markets. He is considered one of the leading macro investment strategists today – he is a regular guest on [[CNBC]] and [[Bloomberg TV]] and was voted as one of the twelve smartest people on Wall Street in 2013 by [[Business Insider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-smartest-people-on-wall-street-2013-6?op=1|title=The 12 Smartest People On Wall Street|date=1 June 2013|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=14 October 2015|quote=As head of global rates and currencies research at BAML, David Woo has to keep track of a lot of different things at once – and for those interested in global macro, Woo's perspective is a must-read. Recently, he flagged developments across major world markets as inconsistent, warning of a global slowdown and a major market re-alignment. Woo remains cautious on the outlook for the U.S. economy in the short term, along with its implication for risk assets. However, he says that if the economy begins to improve along the lines of what stocks are already pricing in, then the euro could be the biggest beneficiary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woo is known for his contrarian calls on the [[United States elections, 2016]],&lt;ref name=Gurdusl2016&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/08/bofaml-analyst-got-ovation-from-co-workers-the-morning-after-election.html|title=Merrill Lynch analyst got a standing ovation from 300 of his co-workers the morning after the election for nailing what would happen|last=Gurdus|first=Elizabeth|date=8 December 2016|publisher=[[CNBC]]|accessdate=8 December 2016|quote=Woo said markets were failing to accurately price in the probability of a Trump win, almost treating the election as a "nonevent."

So says David Woo, head of global rates and currencies research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. While some question the existence of any conflict -- arguing that falling exchange rates merely reflect efforts by central banks to spur lackluster domestic economies -- Woo expresses concern. “There is a growing consensus in the market that an unspoken currency war has broken out,” he said in a report to clients this week. “The reason why this is a war is that it is ultimately a zero-sum game -- someone gains only because someone else will lose.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2015-16 devaluation of the [[renminbi]],&lt;ref name=Adinolfi2015/&gt; [[Bitcoin]],&lt;ref name=Weisenthal2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alden2013/&gt; and the future of the [[Euro]].&lt;ref name=Nixon2012/&gt;

== The 2016 US election ==
In September 2016, Woo said "markets were failing to adequately price in the probability of a Trump win"&lt;ref name=Gurdusl2016/&gt; and predicted that "if Trump won, it would bring about a stronger dollar and higher rates thanks to fiscal stimulus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-12/strategist-if-trump-wins-the-u-s-economy-would-take-off-in-a-big-way|title='Strategist: If Trump Wins, 'The U.S. Economy Would Take Off in a Big Way'|last=Kawa|first=Luke|date=12 September 2016|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=12 September 2016|quote=David Woo says investors are still underestimating the real estate mogul's chances of ascending to the highest office in the land, and what a seismic change this could be for markets and the world's largest economy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Currency war ==
In February 2015, Woo predicted that the world was heading into a currency war due to "diminished stigma" and the fact that "inaction automatically entails loss. "If everyone's playing this game you have no choice but to play it, because otherwise you get left behind," he said. Woo called currency war a "zero sum game".&lt;ref name=Sidibe|2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kennedyl2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/03/bofa-strategist-currency-war-to-be-lose-lose-game.html|title='Currency war' to be 'lose-lose' game: Strategist|last=Cox|first=Jeff|date=3 February 2015|publisher=[[CNBC]]|accessdate=3 February 2015|quote=The world is heading toward a global currency war that Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategist David Woo said ultimately will have no winners.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The 2015-16 renminbi devaluation ==
As early as April 2015, Woo argued that the renminbi was set to fall because "China cannot allow for looser capital flows while maintaining its monetary policy targets, which include limiting the yuan's moves against the US dollar.&lt;ref name=Adinolfi2015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-one-of-wall-streets-top-analysts-is-betting-against-the-yuan-2015-04-27|title=Why one of Wall Street’s top analysts is betting against the yuan - MarketWatch|last=Adinolfi|first=Joseph|date=27 April 2015|publisher=[[MarketWatch]]|accessdate=14 October 2015|quote=In a note to clients, David Woo, head of global rates and currencies research at Bank of America Merrill, said China cannot allow for looser capital flows while maintaining its monetary-policy targets, which include limiting the yuan’s moves against the U.S. dollar.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the August 2015 renminbi devaluation, Woo predicted the renminbi could decline further by as much as 10% against the dollar in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-04/boring-wall-street-analyst-notes-are-out-bold-and-funny-are-in|title=Boring Wall Street Analyst Notes Are Out. Bold, Funny Are In|last=Nguyen|first=Lananh|date=4 December 2016|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=4 December 2016|quote=In "The Great Divorce," published in November 2015, Woo outlined the biggest call of his career, arguing that China’s currency could tumble as much as 10 percent against the dollar in 2016. The estimate was the fourth-most pessimistic of more than 40 forecasts. The onshore yuan has fallen more than 7 percent since, reaching an eight-year low last month and leaving rival strategists racing to catch up.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woo also argued that this would have global repercussions, including a "shallower Fed cycle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-23/bank-of-america-the-great-divorce-between-the-world-s-two-largest-economies-will-drive-currency-and-rates-markets-in-2016|title=Bank of America: The 'Great Divorce' Between the World's Two Largest Economies Will Drive Currency and Rates Markets in 2016|last=Kawa|first=Luke|date=23 November 2015|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=23 November 2015|quote=The strategist believes that the Federal Reserve's terminal rate—the ceiling for how high its policy rate will go—will be dragged down by the decline in China's currency..}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kawa2015&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-americas-woo-china-still-120303858.html|title=Bank of America's Woo: "China Is Still More Important Than The Fed" - Yahoo Finance|last=Kawa|first=Luke|date=6 October 2015|publisher=Yahoo! Finance|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Woo called the Chinese equity rally the "world’s largest bubble since dot-com boom of the late 1990s"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/06/24/meet-the-worlds-biggest-stock-market-bubble-since-the-dot-com-boom/|title=Meet the world’s biggest stock market bubble since the dot-com boom|last=Swanson|first=Ana|date=24 June 2015|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=14 October 2015|quote=No other stock market has ever grown this much in dollar terms over a 12-month period. David Woo, the head of Global Rates and Currencies Research at Bank of America, has called it the world’s largest stock market bubble since the dot-com boom of the 1990s.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and predicted that Chinese shares "may drop as much as 30%", and creating a "knock-on effect on the whole world economy."&lt;ref name=Hu2015&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-18/why-bofa-s-global-bond-guru-is-fixated-on-china-s-equity-bubble |title=Why BofA’s Global Bond Guru Is Fixated on Chinese Equities |last1=Hu |first1=Fox |last2=Keene |first2=Tom |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |accessdate=14 October 2015 |quote=Woo said China’s rally has become so big -- he called it the world’s largest bubble since dot-com boom of the late 1990s -- that the eventual collapse will have consequences for markets around the world. Chinese shares may drop as much as 30 percent when the mania ends, weighing on consumers who have been an important driver of growth in Asia’s largest economy, Woo said. He expects the selloff will be bullish for the dollar and U.S. Treasuries. It will have a “knock on effect on the whole world economy,” Woo said. “The only thing that’s holding up the Chinese economy are the Chinese consumers right now. The Chinese consumers are all involved in the Chinese stock market.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bitcoin ==
In December 2013, Woo argued that [[Bitcoin]] "can become a major means of payment for e-commerce and may emerge as a serious competitor to traditional money transfer providers", an opinion that Joe Weisenthal said "represents a top-fligh kappat mind at a major financial institution assessing it in a serious way, and coming to the conclusion that it could be the real deal."&lt;ref name=Weisenthal2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/david-woo-on-bitcoin-2013-12|title=David Woo On Bitcoin|last=Weisenthal|first=Joe|date=5 December 2013|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alden2013&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/for-bitcoin-a-setback-in-china-and-an-endorsement-on-wall-street/?_r=0|title=For Bitcoin, a Setback in China and an Endorsement on Wall Street|last=Alden|first=William|date=5 December 2013|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Woo put the upper bound of Bitcoin’s fair value at $1300,&lt;ref name=Lopez2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-mo-bitcoin-bofa-merrill-lynch-20131206-story.html|title=Bitcoin has clear 'potential for growth,' currency analyst says|last=Lopez|first=Ricardo|date=6 December 2013|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that "Bitcoin is highly volatile, the result of speculation activities, and that's hindering its general acceptance as a form of payment."&lt;ref name=Lopez2013/&gt;

== The 2012 European debt crisis ==
In July 2012, in a cost-benefit analysis of whether individual members of the Eurozone should stay with the euro, David Woo and Athanasios Vamvakidis argued that “Italy and Ireland emerge as the countries with the greatest incentive to exit.” They concluded that a much weaker euro was necessary to reduce the incentive of any country to exit.&lt;ref name=Nixon2012&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303644004577523090813458030|title=Italy and Germany's Endgame for the Euro|last=Nixon|first=Simon|date=12 July 2012|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=14 October 2015|quote=The risk of a euro-zone breakup may actually be rising rather than falling, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists David Woo and Athanasios Vamvakidis. Using game theory to consider how the situation might evolve, they believe the crisis will boil down to a game of bluff between Italy and Germany in which neither country has an incentive to back down.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== US energy independence and the dollar ==
In March 2013, Woo argued that "rising U.S. crude oil and natural gas production will likely lift the American greenback against major currencies" by shrinking the US current account deficit, boosting investment and reducing the correlation between the dollar and oil prices.&lt;ref name=Hussain2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.financialpost.com/news/energy/energy-boom-bullish-for-u-s-dollar-baml-analyst|title=Energy boom bullish for U.S. dollar: BAML analyst|last=Hussain|first=Yadhullah|date=11 March 2013|publisher=[[Financial Post]]|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deferred Acquisition Costs''' ('''DAC''') is a term commonly used in the [[general insurance|insurance]] business. It describes the practice of [[Deferral|deferring]] the cost of acquiring a new customer over the duration of the insurance contract. [[Insurance company|Insurance companies]] face large upfront costs incurred in issuing new business, such as [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] to sales agents, [[underwriting]], bonus interest and other acquisition expenses.

DAC under [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States)|U.S. GAAP]], MSSB (Modified Statutory Solvency Basis) and [[IAS 39]] are all very similar, except that
IAS 39 only allows direct, incremental costs to be deferred rather than all acquisition costs.

==Background==
[[Insurance company|Insurance companies]] incur large [[expense]]s when acquiring new business, but to ensure that they comply with GAAP's [[matching principle]] they need to spread out these costs over the period in which revenues are earned.

The DAC is treated as an [[asset]] on the [[balance sheet|Balance Sheet]] and [[amortization|amortized]] over the life of the insurance contract.

==Accrual accounting of DAC==
Accrual accounting and deferring implies timewise matching(synchronization) of income and expenses: an incurred cost is capitalized and does not become an expense until it is recognized in the financial statements of the company. In an accounting sense, it is the amortization of that cost, and not the original cost itself, that becomes the expense.  Hence, certain costs which are incurred to acquire insurance contracts should not be recognized as an expense in the accounting period in which they are incurred but should be capitalized as an asset on the balance sheet and gradually amortized over the lifetime of the insurance contracts. Such costs are called Deferred Acquisition Expenses (DAE) and capitalization of DAE results in setting up of an asset called Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC).

Establishment of the DAC asset tends to reduce the policy’s first year strain and generally produces a smoother pattern of earnings.

To meet the capitalization criteria, these expenses must vary with and be primarily related to the acquisition of new business.

Examples of Deferrable Acquisition Expenses:
*Commissions in excess of ultimate commissions
*Underwriting costs
*Policy Issuance costs

All other expenses associated with the new business that do not vary with and are not primarily related to new policies are classified as non-deferrable acquisition expenses.

==DAC Amortization==
Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC) represents the “un-recovered investment” in the policies issued and are therefore capitalized as an [[intangible asset]] to match costs with related revenues. Over time the acquisition costs are recognized as an expense that reduces the DAC asset. The process of recognizing the costs in the income statement is known as amortization and refers to the DAC asset being amortized, or reduced over a number of years.

The amortization requires an amortization basis that determines how much DAC should be turned into an expense in each accounting period. The amortization basis varies by FAS classification:
*FAS 60/97LP – Premiums
*FAS 97 – Estimated Gross Profits (EGP)
*FAS 120 – Estimated Gross Margins (EGM)

Under FAS 60, assumptions are "locked in" at policy issue and cannot be changed. However, under FAS 97 and 120, assumptions are based on estimates that require adjusting DAC as needed. In addition, DAC [[amortization]] uses estimated [[gross margin]]s as a basis and an [[interest rate]] is applied to the DAC based on investment returns. The rate at which one amortizes the DAC is referred to the k-factor.

A write off of DAC or amortization of DAC may be caused by dynamical unlocking or true up. The replacement of assumptions by experience for the projections of future years is called “dynamical unlocking”. The replacement of assumed values by realized values of the past year is called “true up process”.

*Shadow DAC includes unrealized gains as required for balance sheet reporting. In other words Shadow DAC is applied to reduce/increase the amortization of the DAC taking into consideration the unrealized gains and losses.
*Regular DAC amortization affects the income statement and does not take unrealized gains into account. In other words, regular DAC amortization takes into account any realized gains and losses in order to smooth out earnings. In case of a large loss regular DAC amortization can be applied to "defer" the acquisition costs to future periods thereby reducing the expenses and increasing yield for the specific period. The DAC amortization will thus increase in future reporting periods.

==The K-Factor==
Also referred to as KDAC, the K-Factor is basically the percentage of gross profits required to provide for deferred policy acquisition costs. KDAC is:
DAC amortization rate = [Present value of Deferrable Acquisition Expenses + Accumulated Value of DAC]/[Present value of Estimated Gross Profits(EGPs) + Accumulated value of Actual Gross Profits(AGPs)]

The K-factor can change from year to year due to:

1) The true-up process (replacement of expected values by realized values, i.e. actual historical gross profits (AGP) replace prior estimates of Gross profits (EGP))

2) The dynamical unlocking (replacement of assumptions by experience for the projections of future years)

The DAC is recoverable if the k-factor is less than 100%.

If there is an Unearned Revenue Liability (URL), it may even be recoverable if the K-factor is higher than 100%.
If the K-factor is greater than 100% and there is no URL, a portion of the DAC or the total DAC has to be written off immediately, so that the new K-factor is equal 100%.

He led his party in the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Austria)|2009 European Parliament election]]. He was a [[Member of the European Parliament]] between 2009 and 2011. He was sentenced to 4 years jail as consequence of the [[2011 cash for influence scandal|2011 cash for laws scandal]].

==Business holdings==
''Der Standard'' newspaper's investigations in Ernst Strasser found that Strasser has many business holdings and listed some of these activities. Strasser founded ''Consulting, Coaching &amp; Educating-GesmbH'' (CCE) in 2005. It is a one-man company 100% owned by Strasser. For the first two years, the CCE recorded a profit of around 380,000 euros. When the newspaper studied the holdings in May 2009, more recent data was missing from the commercial register. The company owns stakes in various other companies.&lt;ref name="strasserderstandard"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://derstandard.at/1242317070690/EUWahlkampf-Der-Global-Player-vom-Badeteich | publisher=Der Standard | title=Im Sumpf der Polizei-Freunde von Redaktion | date=2007-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One company, ''Business Consulting &amp; Development GmbH'', is said to have imported [[olive oil]] from [[Syria]]. Another company had links to [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[bribery]] investigations.&lt;ref name="strasserderstandard"/&gt;

Strasser's CCE owns stakes in ''Russland-Connection Anteile'' as well as ''Firmen Advisory Partners'' (registered in Innsbruck), ''Konti Holding'' (registered in Wien) and ''Expert Management Beratung Russia'' (registered in [[Vienna]]).&lt;ref name="strasserderstandard"/&gt;

==2011 cash for influence scandal==
On 20 March 2011, Britain's [[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]] reported that three MEPs, including Austria's Ernst Strasser, had accepted offers of up to 100,000 [[euro]]s ([[United States dollar|$]]141,000) per year in exchange for proposing amendments in the EU parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/euparliamentcorruptionbritainaustriaromaniaslovenia EU parliament probes MEP corruption claims]&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian vice-chancellor and ÖVP leader [[Josef Pröll]] had called for the deputy's "immediate resignation from all political posts," describing his behaviour as "unacceptable". After initially fighting the claims, Strasser announced his resignation on Sunday, noting: "I have decided to take this step because there has been a campaign against me in Austria" and this was "damaging the People's Party."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/austria-parliament.960 Austrian MEP Strasser resigns over corruption claims]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 2013, Strasser was sentenced to 4 years jail.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13217">'''Food prices''' refer to the (averaged) [[price level]] for [[food]] in particular countries or regions or on a global scale. The [[food industry]]'s contribution to the price levels and fluctuations come from the [[food production]] process, [[food marketing]] and [[food distribution]]. Source of uncontrollable [[price fluctuation]]s are varying [[crop yield]] from [[excess supply]] to [[harvest failure]] and [[food speculation]] activities. It is speculated that already the global [[climate change]] could be a major factor behind rising food prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5434|title=Climate Change: The Unseen Force Behind Rising Food Prices?|date=2013|publisher=World Watch Institute|accessdate=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A continuing drought in South Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/Economy/sa-drought-persists-despite-may-rainfall-20160530|title=SA drought persists despite May rainfall|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; may - amongst other factors - have [[food inflation]] soar 11% until end of 2016 according to the [[South African Reserve Bank]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|title= SA’s ticking food price bomb

When food commodities become too expensive on the world market, [[food security]] is in danger especially for [[developing countries]]. In keeping with the [[supply and demand]]-principle, global prices will [[Market trend|on average continue]] to rise with the growing [[world population]].

==Global differences==
Sharp dramatic rises in the food inflation as happened during the [[2007-08 world food price crisis]] have been more pronounced in developing countries than in the [[OECD]] and [[North America]] in particular, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/economic-and-financial-indicators/21607872-consumer-food-price-inflation|title=Consumer food-price inflation|publisher=The Economist|date=2014-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-economic/cpi/en/|title=FAO Global and regional consumer food inflation monitoring|publisher=FAO}} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consumer price index|Consumer prices]] in the [[rich country|rich countries]] are massively influenced by the power of [[discount store]]s and constitute only a small part of the entire [[cost of living]]. In particular, [[Western pattern diet]] constituents like those that are processed by [[fast food chain]]s are comparatively cheap in the Western hemisphere. [[Profit (economics)|Profits]] rely primarily on quantity (see [[mass production]]), less than high-price quality. For some product classes like [[dairy industry|dairy]] or [[meat industry|meat]], [[overproduction]] has twisted the price relations in a way utterly unknown in underdeveloped countries ("[[butter mountain]]"). The situation for poor societies is worsened by certain [[free trade agreement]]s that allow easier export of food in the "southern" direction than vice versa. A striking example can be found in tomato exports from Italy to [[Ghana]] by virtue of the [[Economic Partnership Agreements]] where the artificially cheap vegetables play a significant role in the destruction of indigenous agriculture and a corresponding further decline in the already ailing [[economic power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/2015/51/afrika-eu-handelspolitik-subventionen-armut-flucht|title=Afrika: Ein Mann pflückt gegen Europa|first1=Matthias|last1=Krupa|first2=Caterina|last2=Lobenstein|date=30 December 2015|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2016|via=Die Zeit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.die-gdi.de/uploads/media/Economic_Partnership_Agreements_and_Food_Security.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===World bank food price watch===
The [[World Bank]] releases the quarterly ''Food Price Watch report'' which highlights trends in domestic food prices in [[low-income country|low- and middle-income countries]], and outlines the ([[food policy|food]]) policy implications of food price fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/publication/food-price-watch-home|title=Food Price Watch:|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grocery Foods Economics==
In the long term, prices are expected to stabilize.&lt;ref name="cnn24march2008"/&gt; Farmers will grow more grain for both [[fuel]] and food and eventually bring prices down.&lt;ref name="cnn24march2008"/&gt; This has already occurred with [[wheat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kimball |first=Jack |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE57652C20090807 |title=World food prices stabilize, no drop in sight: WFP |agency=Reuters |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/185426/inflation-slows-in-feb-as-food-prices-stabilize |title=Inflation slows in Feb. as food prices stabilize |publisher=GMA News |date=2010-03-05 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; with more [[crops]] planted in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Europe]] in 2009. However, the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] projects that consumers still have to deal with more expensive food until at least 2018.&lt;ref name="cnn24march2008"/&gt;

It is rare for the spikes to hit all major foods in most countries at once. Food prices rose 4% in the United States in 2007, the highest increase since 1990, and are expected to climb as much again in 2008. As of December 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls. In China, the price of [[pork]] jumped 58% in 2007. In the 1980s and 1990s, farm subsidies and support programs allowed major grain exporting countries to hold large surpluses which could be tapped during food shortages to keep prices down. However, new trade policies have made agricultural production much more responsive to market demands, putting global food reserves at their lowest since 1983.&lt;ref name="cnn24march2008"&gt;"Food prices rising across the world", CNN. 24 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Food prices are rising, wealthier Asian consumers are westernizing their diets, and farmers and nations of the third world are struggling to keep up the pace. Asian nations have contributed at a more rapid growth rate in the past five years to the global fluid and powdered milk manufacturing industry. In 2008, this accounted for more than 30% of production with China accounting for more than 10% of both production and consumption in the global fruit and vegetable processing and preserving industry. The trend is similarly evident in industries such as soft drink and bottled water manufacturing, as well as global cocoa, chocolate, and sugar confectionery manufacturing, forecast to grow by 5.7% and 10.0% respectively during 2008 in response to soaring demand in Chinese and Southeast Asian markets.

Rising food prices over recent years have been linked with social unrest around the world, including rioting in [[Bangladesh]] and [[Mexico]],&lt;ref name="Ind"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-real-hunger-games-how-banks-gamble-on-food-prices--and-the-poor-lose-out-7606263.html | title=The real hunger games: How banks gamble on food prices – and the poor lose out | newspaper=The Independent | accessdate=April 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;Food and the Arab Spring http://www.economist.com/node/21550328&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Overseas Development Institute]] researchers showed that [[rice]] has more than doubled in price since 2000, rising by 120% in real terms. This was as a result of shifts in trade policy and restocking by major producers. More fundamental drivers of increased prices are the higher costs of fertiliser, diesel and labour. Parts of Asia see rural wages rise with potential large benefits for the 1.3 billion (2008 estimate) of Asia's poor in reducing the poverty they face. However, this negatively impacts more vulnerable groups who don't share in the economic boom, especially in Asian and African coastal cities. The researchers said the threat means social-protection policies are needed to guard against price shocks. The research proposed that in the longer run, the rises present opportunities to export for Western African farmers with high potential for rice production to replace imports with domestic production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/7687-end-cheap-rice-prices-rural-labour-wages |title=The end of cheap rice: a cause for celebration? |publisher=Overseas Development Institute |accessdate=2015-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140619005820/http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/7687-end-cheap-rice-prices-rural-labour-wages |archivedate=2014-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Aitken Clark''' (1823–1873) was a Scottish manufacturer and benefactor.

==Life==
He was the son of John Clark, a thread manufacturer in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], where he was born on 9 August 1823. He was educated at [[Paisley grammar school]], and in 1840 was sent the firm of Kerr &amp; Co. of [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. On reaching manhood he returned to Paisley, and entered into partnership with Messrs. Robert and John Ronald, shawlmakers, under the name of "Ronald &amp; Clark".&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Clark, George Aitken|volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1851 Clark gave up his partnership to go into with his brother-in-law, Robert Kerr, as a thread manufacturer. To extend the business he went in 1856 to the United States, and to avoid the tariffs the firm in 1864 established a factory at [[Newark, New Jersey]]. It was a success, and Clark's O.N.T. spool cotton soon became a recognised American brand. In 1866 the firm amalgamated with the original firm of Clark under the name of Clark &amp; Co.,with an anchor as their trade-mark. Clark died at Newark on 13 February 1873.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Paisley Town Hall.jpg|thumb|Paisley Town Hall]]
By his will Clark left £20,000 for scholarships at [[Glasgow University]], and £20,000 to build a town hall in Paisley. The firm of Clark &amp; Co. subscribed a further £40,000, and the building then styled the "George A. Clark Town Hall" was opened in 1882.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; The architect was [[William Henry Lynn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=63609|title=Lynn, William Henry|first=Paul|last=Larmour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Edwards Brown''' (1780–1848) was an English-born [[Chile]]an businessman.

George Edwards was the son of a carpenter John Edwards and his wife Elizabeth Brown, as stated in his baptism certificate in the parish of Saint Leonard's of London. 

George “Jorge” Edwards Brown was an [[England|English]] sailor who later lived and served in Chile. He was the founder and patriarch of the [[Edwards family]] in Chile. 

He sailed from a young age in British ships engaged in trade and privateering or looting. He travelled across Spanish South America visiting Chile for the first time in 1797. It was not until 1804 that his name could be inscribed in the history of Chile. The previous year he had enlisted as a surgeon in the British raider “Blackhouse” or “Bacar” who were dedicated to looting and plundering ships and ports in the Spanish colonies in South America. During this trip, Bacar anchored in the bay of [[Coquimbo]] and then taken by assault the city which was unguarded. 

During the sack of the city Jorge Edwards entered the house of Diego de Ossandón to steal, but he found his daughter, Isabel de Ossandón, who he fell in love with immediately. He decided to desert the ship and asking for shelter in the house of Diego Ossandón. Family tradition says that when Edwards did not return to the British ship, they spent three days looking for him through all the houses in the city. Edwards hid for three days, hiding in a barrel of wine from his former shipmates. On the third day Spanish reinforcements arrived, forcing the British to retreat from the city, to continue their raids to the north. Once the Spanish authorities were aware of the presence of Edwards in [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]], he was arrested and sent to [[Callao]], where he was detained. 

Once released he returned to La Serena in 1805 he was baptized into the Catholic faith. The baptism certificate recognizes that parents are Juan Eduardos (John Edwards) and Isabel Pardo (Elizabeth Brown), Spanish forms of their Welsh and English names respectively. 

After that he went to work as a doctor and surgeon for some years, but quickly became the enabler or lender of small miners in the area of [[Coquimbo]], which allowed him to build a small fortune after 10 years. His distinctly anti-Spanish feelings made him a supporter of the patriot cause during the [[independence wars of Chile|Chilean Wars of Independence]], making donations to build the fleet for the liberation of Peru, commanded by a fellow Brit, [[Lord Thomas Cochrane]]. 

The Supreme Director of Chile, [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] granted Edwards Chilean citizenship papers in 1818 as a reward for his services to the Independence cause. He was appointed Deputy for Huasco in 1822. He was President of the Provincial Assembly of Coquimbo in 1825, Deputy for Andacollo in 1826 and Deputy of Vallenar in 1834. 

Jorge Edwards married his first wife Isabel Ossandón Iribarren in 1807, with which he had 8 children, including Agustín Edwards Ossandón. Widowed in 1834, he married his second wife Ventura Argandoña Subercaseaux, with whom he had children.

== Education ==
Born in [[Tbilisi]], Kvirikashvili went through the compulsory military service in the [[Soviet army]] from 1986 to 1988. He graduated from the [[Tbilisi State Medical University]] with a degree in Internal Medicine in 1991 and then from the [[Tbilisi State University]] with a degree in Economics in 1995. In 1998, he obtained a [[Master of Science in Finance|master's degree]] in finances from the [[University of Illinois]].&lt;ref name="eco"&gt;[http://www.economy.ge/en/george-kvirikashvili George Kvirikashvili] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203015024/http://www.economy.ge/en/george-kvirikashvili |date=2013-12-03 }}. Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development of Georgia. Retrieved November 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Kvirikashvili worked as an executive for various banks in Georgia from 1993 to 1999 and as a deputy head of fiscal and monetary office at the State Chancellery of the [[President of Georgia]] in 1999. From 1999 to 2004, he was member of the [[Parliament of Georgia]] on the ticket of [[New Rights]] party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=25355 Ivanishvili's Incoming Cabinet]. [[Civil Georgia]]. October 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Rose Revolution]] swept [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] to the presidency of Georgia, Kvirikashvili returned to his businesses. From 2006 to 2011, he was Director General of Cartu Bank, owned by the multi-billionaire tycoon [[Bidzina Ivanishvili]]. With Ivanishvili's coming in politics and the victory of his [[Georgian Dream]] coalition over Saakashvili's [[United National Movement (Georgia)|United National Movement]] in the [[Georgian parliamentary election, 2012|October 2012 parliamentary election]], Kvirikashvili was appointed Minister of Economy and Sustainable Development of Georgia in the [[cabinet of Bidzina Ivanishvili]] in October 2012. He additionally assumed the office of Vice Prime Minister in July 2013. He retained both these positions in the succeeding [[Cabinet of Irakli Garibashvili|cabinet]] of [[Irakli Garibashvili]], Ivanishvili's choice as his successor, in November 2013.&lt;ref name="eco"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=26705 New PM Wins Confidence Vote].

'''Hudson Boat Works''' is a rowing [[racing shell]] manufacturer based in [[London, Ontario]]. Jack Coughlan and his brother-in-law Hugh Hudson founded the company in 1981, and Jack remains Owner and President today. In March 2007, Hudson began production of their "Shark" line of boats.  Designed by Britt Chance, US Naval Architect, Luis Tarrataca, Hudson Design Engineer, and Jack Coughlan, Head of Hudson R&amp;D, the Great White 1x and the Hammerhead 8+ shells and claim to be; faster than ever, more stable, and more comfortable for the rowers. Hudson is the official boat manufacturer for the Canadian and American National Teams. 

Hudson Boat Works boats have won 80 World and Olympic Medals since 1984.

Hudson formerly held the world best time for the men's heavyweight [[eight (rowing)|eight]] for a two thousand meter race which was 5:19.85, designed by Luis Tarrataca, set by the U.S in the [[Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympic games in Athens, Greece]]. The current best time of 5:19.35 was set by the Canadian men's eight in a boat made by German boatmaker [[Empacher]] on May 25, 2012 at a World Cup meet in [[Lucerne, Switzerland]].

{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}
'''Inward investment''' is the injection of money from an external source into a region, in order to purchase capital goods for a branch of a [[corporation]] to locate or develop its presence in the region.

Foreign sources, such as transnational corporations or [[multinational corporation]]s invest money by introducing new industrial sites to an area, in order to produce more of their product, sometimes in response to changes noticed in that area, such as a growing population or enhanced transport network. Inward investment creates jobs in an area and brings wealth into the economy.

Some places do however attract inward investment due to their relative remoteness, for example a company wanting to recruit personnel with relatively common skills might deliberately relocate to an area where wage rates are relatively low, a factor that could arise because of the absence of similar jobs or localised [[underemployment]]. Some international investors might seek to take advantage of relatively lax regulation through investing abroad.

Some economic development agencies, governments or local authorities are occasionally accused of concentrating on attracting ''inward'' investment to such an extent that they neglect to nurture home-grown small businesses or entrepreneurs with exciting ideas. As with much marketing effort, a balance is often required to maximise economic progress that is socially and environmentally appropriate.

Another aspect of inward investment is financial inward investment activity, which rather than focusing on attracting "offshoot" operations of overseas companies, focuses on encouraging global focused overseas venture capitalist and hedge-fund investment into companies in a country or region.

In [[Italy]] the Senior [[Civil Service]] or "la dirigenza"{{Specify|date=January 2017}} is the set of high-ranking executives (“Dirigenti”) who are in charge of the top and middle management of national or local governmental offices.

==Structure==

Senior executives come in two echelons:
*First level: Directors Generals and Chief of Departments (about 400 executives)
*Second level: Directors of Division and heads of peripheral units (about 3,500 executives)
First and second level positions are identified in each ministry. Management responsibilities (supervision of one or more bureaux) determine whether or not someone is an executive, not qualifications. This objective approach shows the exact number of first level executives and permits the development of a database with up-to-date information about age, seniority, gender, level and ministry.
In each ministry, second level positions are further classified accordingly to the responsibilities attached to their offices position, corresponding to the classification adopted by the ministry.

Until October 2002, the Senior Civil Service was meant to be an inter-ministerial homogeneous body, managed by a pool known as the "Ruolo Unico dei Dirigenti" (Uniform Register). The creation of this structure, under the supervision of the Prime Minister, was the backbone of the reform conducted from 1993 till 2001. It was underpinned by a database of jobs and profiles. This tool allowed the government to publish available positions in real time and to establish a labour market for managers. The new text adopted in 2002 has replaced inter-ministerial management of executives with ministerial management. However, the inter-ministerial database and the labour market for first level executives have been kept.

Other public bodies, at national and local level, have their Senior Civil Services. 
Today senior civil servants are grouped into eight different contractual areas: 
* I (Ministries),
* II (Regions and Territorial Autonomies),
* III (National Health Service - administrative),
* IV (National Health Service - medical),
* V (School),
* VI (Fiscal and economic Agencies),
* VII (University),
* VIII (Prime Minister's Office).

Civil servants below executive level have a different contract with separate grading and pay arrangements.

==Recruitment==

Executives are normally recruited through competitions. There are two types of competition:

*the “Fast Stream Programme” (“Corso-Concorso di Formazione Dirigenziale”) is for people who join the Public Administration School ("Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione") after a highly selective national exam, getting immediately a senior rank position. The curriculum of this school covers 30 months of alternating theoretical training - mostly in organisational sociology - and practical training - with many hands-on problems - and internships, often at the [[European Commission]] or other international bodies. On completion, students have to pass another examination. Depending on their results, graduates select their future ministry. The level required for every applicant is a master's. Applicants may be students, Italian or foreign government executives or private sector managers. The Public Administration School actively encourages the emergence of a team spirit in all basic training programmes. Graduates from the first classes have set up an association whose aim is to disseminate innovation in the public administration. Moreover, courses are not only taught by government executives but also by academic researchers, which leads to training partnerships with the universities;
*the second type is a competition organised by the ministries. The prerequisites and training standards are less strict than as for the first type. Candidates who pass this competition follow a programme of almost one year at the Public Administration School.

The executive group is increasingly targeting people from the private sector, universities and regional entities, which currently account for 10% of first level executives and 8% of second level. External candidates can only be hired for a fixed term.

==Appointment and tenure==

The status of executives has been governed by private law since 1998. A collective bargaining agreement (drafted by ARAN, the agency representing the public employer and the executives' trade union), stipulates the management conditions required in individual contracts. In other words, a senior executive signs two contracts:

*a permanent contract with the ministry where he is employed;
*a fixed-term contract with his or her supervisor (secretary-general of the ministry for first level executives, and first level executives for second level executives).

Fixed-term contracts may not exceed three years for first level executives and five years for executives. These contracts set out the remuneration terms. In 2002, the minister was given the job of setting objectives, which must be very precise, reducing the role of the contract. Achievement of the objectives is  nevertheless verified every year based on management control and strategic-planning results.

First level SEOs must be confirmed by every new government, or they lose their position.

==Performance assessment and pay==

The pay structure emphasizes workload, merit and work performance ("pay for performance"), while it has no regard to seniority and length of service.

Pay is based on:
*a fixed wage (60% of the remuneration);
*a portion (20%) linked to the responsibility attached to the position, corresponding to different [[pay grade]]s adopted by the ministry (three levels at the Civil Service Ministry - A-B-C - and five at the Finance Ministry - A-B-C-D-E). This classification is transparent and published by every ministry;
*a percentage (20%) tied to the achievement of objectives.

Executives are subjected to an annual assessment based on achievement of objectives, the adequacy
of actions implemented in compliance with ministerial directives and the information supplied by the
management-control and strategic-assessment service. Executives whose contract expires are assessed to
determine whether to keep and/or to promote them.

Assessment disputes are reviewed by an appeal committee.

When an executive cannot immediately find a new position on termination of a fixed-term contract, he /she keeps part of his fixed wage (60% of the remuneration).

==Promotion and mobility==

An executive's career does not follow a straight line. On completion of a fixed-term contract, he or she can move from a grade C position to a grade A position if assessment results are highly satisfactory. In order to encourage both internal promotion and competition, 40% of the positions of director generals may  be filled by second level executives and 10% by non-government personalities.

When the "rotation" obligation was formally withdrawn in the decree of October 2002 (probably because of shorter contracts), the principle of mobility was preserved. It is supported by an inter-ministerial database with real-time vacancies at every ministry. 
Five-year stints in the private sector and international organisations are also encouraged. These do not affect the executive's career.

==Training and learning==

Continuing education is covered by a directive from 2001 whose purpose was to galvanise training plans, considered a primary tool for leading change at government services. Today, training must be mentioned in resumes published in the interministerial database. The purpose of this requirement is to give  executives a strong incentive to get trained. In order to promote the use of management methodologies and recognition of international concerns in executive actions, executives are now entitled to work for up to five years in the private sector or in international organisations with the right to return to the executive group without loss of prerogatives.

Lastly, line managers can become researchers. A plan launched by the Public Administration School allows interested executives to research useful government modernisation themes under research teachers.

==History==

===Background of reforms===
In February 1993, a founding legislative decree introduced contracts for officials who are now employed under general labour laws.

*a new agency, ARAN, which represents the public employer in negotiations with unions and is responsible for drafting collective bargaining agreements;
*a separation between political responsibilities (indirizzo politico) and administrative responsibilities (responsabilità dirigenziale );
*a new senior management profile: new values, new responsibilities, new management methods;
*the development of an inter-ministerial pool of executives responsible "for the results of the activity managed by their offices and the execution of programmes and projects entrusted to them in the light of productivity objectives and for financial, technical and administrative management results, including organisational and personnel management decisions."

===Reform initiatives and results===
While the decree of 1993 remains the basis for every senior management reform, three periods can be distinguished, each of which raised contractualisation to a new level:

a) 1993 to 1998: the "privatisation" recommended in the working note did not yet apply to first level executives. Their appointments and performance obligations remained the minister's responsibility. Their pay reflected standard scales. Other managers were governed by collective bargaining agreements.

b) 1998 to 2002: collective bargaining agreements became applicable to first level executives. They signed fixed-term contracts under private law specifying objectives and pay. The reform created an inter-ministerial management structure. In principle, all executives should have been lumped in this pool, which the ministries could have sourced for needed profiles. In fact, the ministries remained in control, trying to keep their best executives. Mobility was boosted by the development of an inter-ministerial database with the resumes of all first level executives and a list of available positions updated in real time. The years ahead can be expected to lead gradually to the creation of a genuine labour market.

c) Since October 2002: the appointment and objectives of first level executives are fixed by decree (unilateral public act). Their pay is negotiated bilaterally and laid down in a private contract signed for the term of their appointment (3 years or less). The "ruolo unico dei dirigenti" has made way for ministerial pools but the inter-ministerial database continues to be used. The objective remains to promote mobility.

===Objectives and new competencies===
The newly organised "dirigenza" became the launch pad for the modernisation of public management. The new management of senior management has made the civil service more politically neutral and, as such, has clarified the respective roles of politics and the civil  service. The main purpose of the newly created dirigenza was to remedy the lack of professionalism and the political bias of the hallowed senior public service by fostering a culture of excellence within the government and promoting close relations based on shared principles combining the founding values of the civil service - integrity, neutrality and impartiality - with the more pragmatic qualities demanded from managers. This ethics of accountability remains the cornerstone of all texts adopted since 1993.

'''James Duncan''' (1834–1905) was a Scottish [[Sugar refinery|sugar refiner]] and businessman, who then became a philanthropist and art collector. His house and grounds in Glasgow became Benmore Botanic Garden, managed by Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.

==Biography==
Duncan was born in 1834 in Greenock. He was the son of a second-hand bookseller.&lt;ref name=sugargiant&gt;Philippe Chalmin {{Google books|bOPogF8v9-kC|The Making of a Sugar Giant: Tate and Lyle, 1859–1989|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1850s, James Duncan was studying chemistry at Glasgow. He had a break and took a boat trip from Greenock to the lochs and coastlines of [[Argyllshire]]. While on [[Loch Long]], he conceived a unique method of refining sugar.&lt;ref name=introduncan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbge.org.uk/assets/files/Publications/Pages%20from%20jamesduncanbook0710-.pdf |title=Introduction to James Duncan |date=13 July 2010|publisher=www.rbge.org.uk | format=PDF |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He patented his idea for sugar refining. Then between 1858 and 1861, he became a partner of the Greenock firm of 'Duncan, Bell &amp; Scott'.&lt;ref name=sugargiant/&gt;&lt;ref name=introduncan/&gt; In 1854, the refinery was producing up to 50,000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;William H Marwick {{Google books|etRcAgAAQBAJ|Scotland in Modern Times|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1861, he developed a factory in [[Silvertown]], London, at [[List of locations in the Port of London|Millbank]] 21 Mincing Lane,&lt;ref name=roots&gt;{{cite web |title= Topic: James Duncan of Benmore &amp; Mary Moubray family |date=24 October 2008 |url=http://www.rootschat.com/forum/index.php?topic=336589.0 |publisher=rootschat.com |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; called the 'Clyde Wharf Refinery'.&lt;ref name=sugargiant/&gt; It was the largest and most profitable sugar refinery in London.&lt;ref name=introduncan/&gt;&lt;ref name=sugarcane&gt;{{cite journal  |last=Martineau |first=George |date=February 1918 |title=Sugar cane and beet, an object lesson|url=https://archive.org/stream/sugarcanebeetobj00martuoft/sugarcanebeetobj00martuoft_djvu.txt
|journal=Sugar Cane |volume=4 |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was always refining the process and learning different applications to keep his company at the top of the industry. At the peak of the business, they were producing up to 2 thousand tons of sugar a week.&lt;ref name=sugargiant/&gt;&lt;ref name=sugarcane/&gt;

In 1878 he was elected fellow of the [[Society of Chemical Industry]], later becoming its Vice-President. By 1879 he held the prestigious post of 'Chairman of the Sugar Refiners' Committee',&lt;ref name=sugarcane/&gt; and also became Vice-President of the 'Railway and Canal Traders' Union'.&lt;ref name=introduncan/&gt;

In 1884, cheap German sugar arrived in the UK, which was much cheaper than UK produced sugar.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt;&lt;ref name=sugarcane/&gt;

In August 1885, he published an article in the 'Sugar Cane' journal, titled 'The bounty on exportation of refined sugar from the United States'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The bounty on exportation of refined sugar from the United States |url=http://search.socialhistory.org/Record/153891/Details |publisher=search.socialhistory.org |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, the unfair foreign competition meant that he had to close his London works of Clyde Wharf.&lt;ref name=sugarcane/&gt;

He returned to Scotland, to manage the smaller refinery business in Greenock. After he retired, he spent time with his sister 'Mary Moubray' in [[Strone]], and then spent the winter months in Italy.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt;
 
==Philanthropy==
James Duncan's charitable work was widely known throughout Britain. he gave 20 per cent of his annual £100,000 salary to a range of causes, making him one of the most committed [[philanthropists]] of the time.&lt;ref name=sugargiant/&gt;&lt;ref name=introduncan/&gt;&lt;ref name=building&gt;{{cite web |first=Mary| last=Gibby |url=http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/benmore-fernery/benmore-fernery.htm |title=The Benmore Fernery |year=2013 |website=www.buildingconservation.com |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=culture&gt;{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Moss |title=Enlightened Victorian James Duncan comes home to the Benmore Botanic Garden in Argyll |date=14 March 2011 |url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/history-and-heritage/work-and-daily-life/rural-heritage/art349955 |publisher=culture24.org.uk |accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scotsman&gt;{{cite news |title=Philanthropist, tycoon and great Scot: James Duncan's time has come again |date=3 March 2011 |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/philanthropist-tycoon-and-great-scot-james-duncan-s-time-has-come-again-1-1503538  |publisher=scotsman.com |accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also built 2 churches for 2 different congregations.&lt;ref name=sugargiant/&gt;

He was known as a major collector of fine art and was also a lender of pictures to annual exhibitions, including the [[Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts]]. In 1878, he was elected Vice-President of the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts.  He regularly contributed works to European exhibitions, including the most prestigious at the [[Paris Salon]], and to key international exhibitions of art and industry in France and Germany in the 1870s and 1880s.&lt;ref name=introduncan/&gt;

He was the first Scottish collector of an [[Impressionist]] work including purchasing in 1883, [[Renoir]]'s painting 'Bay of Naples'.&lt;ref name=scotsman/&gt;
The painting was later lent to the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York (who now own it), for a summer exhibition about James Duncan's collection.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt; Duncan was also one of the most valued and important clients of the influential French picture dealer [[Paul Durand-Ruel]], and regularly frequented the studios of Europe's most famous painters.&lt;ref name=introduncan/&gt; He collected works by the likes of [[Raeburn]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]],&lt;ref name=building/&gt; including [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s masterpiece ''Death of Sardanapalus'.&lt;ref name=culture/&gt;

He was friends with various people in different fields of work including; the chemist [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James "Paraffin" Young]], who established
the world's first commercial oil works; the pioneering ophthalmic surgeon 'Dr Neven Gordon Cluckie', whose work led to the establishment of eye surgeries in hospitals throughout
Britain; the celebrated preacher [[Charles Spurgeon]]; [[Henry Boyd (academic)|Rev. Henry Boyd]] (Principal of [[Hertford College Oxford]], 1878–1922), with whom Duncan
had worked closely in the 1870s to improve working conditions in London's East End; and [[Gustave Doré]], the French artist whose gallery, paintings and book illustrations proved so popular in Britain.&lt;ref name=introduncan/&gt;&lt;ref name=culture/&gt; 
“Duncan also employed his significant wealth in helping the poor in Scotland and England and improving the working conditions of his workforce, building churches and schools, providing medical care and introducing an eight-hour working day." noted Peter Baxter (Benmore House Curator).&lt;ref name=culture/&gt;

Duncan had also been in contact with the eminent botanist [[Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker]] and with [[Henry Morton Stanley]], the explorer and friend of [[David Livingstone]] who visited Duncan some time in the 1870s or 1880s.&lt;ref name=introduncan/&gt;

In [[Kilmun]], at Graham's Point there is a memorial to James Duncan. Which was designed by A. Macfarlane Shannon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kilmun, Graham's Point, Memorial to James Duncan, Kilmun |url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/sc-50435-kilmun-graham-s-point-memorial-to-james-d |publisher=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk| accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benmore House==
In 1870, James Duncan purchased Benmore House near Dunoon, Argyll.&lt;ref name=building/&gt;&lt;ref name=benmore&gt;{{cite web|first=Donald |last=Stalker |title=Transactions of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland Plantations of the Estates of Benmore and Kilmun, Argyllshire 
|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/agriculture/page45.htm |publisher=electricscotland.com |accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then set about building a gallery (to showcase his large collection of fine arts. As well as a [[fernery]] and one of the largest greenhouses in Scotland.&lt;ref name=culture/&gt;

The estates amounted up to 12,260 acres of land. He made extensive improvements to the land. On some of which he grazed ''West Highland cattle'' and [[Scottish Blackface|blackfaced sheep]]. The sheep were first seen at the [[Paris International Exhibition of 1878]]. His flock of sheep gained awards at the annual exhibitions of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland.&lt;ref name=benmore/&gt;

He also had over six million trees planted as part of the large landscape alterations he had designed. Including, commissioning features such as the 'Golden Gates'.Which were earlier shown at the Paris International Exhibition.&lt;ref name=scotsman/&gt;

Following the introduction of a German sugar bounty, Duncan had a massive loss of fortune and had to sell the estate in 1889.&lt;ref name=building/&gt;

It was acquired by the Young Family and later gifted to [[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh]]&lt;ref name=roots/&gt; It is now the [[Benmore Botanic Garden]].

His art collection at Benmore was split up and sold, his paintings are now housed in some of world's greatest museums such as the [[Louvre]], the [[Belvedere, Vienna|Belvedere]] in Vienna, the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which is home to four of Duncan's pictures.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt;&lt;ref name=scotsman/&gt;

'''John Duncan Anderson''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|MNZM|size=85%}} is a New Zealand businessman, author and celebrity speaker.  He is  the founder of the travel and leisure company [[Contiki Tours]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://contiki.co.nz/pages/1-about-contiki About Contiki]&lt;/ref&gt; The company is now owned by Trafalgar Tours, itself a division of [[The Travel Corporation]]

==Personal life==
Anderson was born in [[Wellington]], New Zealand in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;''Only Two Seats Left'', autobiography published in 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He is married to Ali (Alison), a passenger who fell ill on one of Contiki's first tours.  They have four children.

Anderson's parents divorced when he was five years old; he was raised primarily by his mother although maintained a good relationship with his father, a dentist who emigrated to England when he was a child.

Anderson emigrated to England in 1961, returning to New Zealand in 1979 with a wife and family.  He lived in [[Auckland]] for many years and currently lives in [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]], [[Marlborough Region|Marlborough]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speakerlink.co.nz/PresentersProfileView.asp?pid=24 Speaker Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2012 New Year Honours (New Zealand)|2012 New Year Honours]], Anderson was appointed a [[New Zealand Order of Merit|Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit]] for services to tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/publications/new-year-honours-list-2012 | title=New Year honours list 2012|date=31 December 2011 | publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet | accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10776022"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10776022 |title=New Year's Honours: John Anderson |author=Wade, Amelia |date=31 December 2011 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overseas experience==
In 1960 Anderson travelled to London, England where his father was living.  Anderson planned his route to England to include many stopovers en route.  As the president of his local [[Junior Chamber International|Jaycees]] association, Anderson contacted fellow presidents in the cities that he planned and received many offers to host him.  In this way, Anderson was able to defray his travel costs considerably.

In his book ''Only Two Seats Left''&lt;ref&gt;[http://theartscentrebookshop.circlesoft.net/catalog/296020/14798 Autobiography Review]&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson describes his travels with a mixture of awe and sense of adventure.  This was Anderson's first travel outside of New Zealand which at that time had a population of just over 2 million.&lt;ref&gt;[1960 in New Zealand]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The first tours==
Arriving in England in 1962, Anderson set about planning a trip to see Europe however had only £25 to his name Anderson came up with the idea of advertising for 11 other young [[Australasia]]ns to join him on the trip.  He worked out the total costs for the trip and then divided by 11, thus providing a free seat for himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celebspeakers.com/speaker/john-anderson/ ''Celebrity Speakers New Zealand'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The trip sold quickly, assisted by Anderson meeting prospective fellow travellers and exaggerating his experience of Europe.  In fact, his only previous experience of Europe was an overnight trip to Paris.  Shortly after having sold all the seats, Anderson was approached by two more prospective passengers.  Anderson decided to take advantage of the interest and advertise a second tour to operate following the first.  This second tour also sold well and sold out before the first tour departed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unlimited.co.nz/unlimited.nsf/growth/on-the-road-again Unlimited Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Anderson's inexperience the tour was a success.  Anderson admitted his lack of European knowledge to his customers on the first day.  After that, he and the eleven others shared duties and decision making, including driving duties in the 12 seater Commer van they christened ''Tiki'' after the [[Tiki|Maori good luck charm]]

For the second tour Anderson had increased the price from £100 to £115 per person.  Despite this, upon arrival in Monaco Anderson found he had nearly run out of money and would be unable to complete the advertised itinerary.  Anderson worked out the amount of money that he would need to express the group directly back to England and took the remaining funds to a casino where he gambled on the [[roulette]] tables.  He won and was able to continue the tour without his customers finding out.

==Contiki Holidays==
The trips which had begun as an exercise to fund his own travels around Europe became a fast-growing business; fleet and staff grew rapidly and a number of new tours were developed under the name ''Tiki Tours'', in recognition of the company's first vehicle.

When the [[Tourism New Zealand|New Zealand Tourist Board]] challenged Anderson over his use of the name ''Tiki Tours'' he changed the company's name to ''Contiki'', the ''con'' coming from [[Continental Europe|The ''Con''tinent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2005/02/25/1109180077418.html Sydney Morning Herald]&lt;/ref&gt;

Contiki grew to include tours worldwide.  During the 1980s the company began to diversify from its roots as a tour company for 18- to 35-year-olds (originally 19 to 29).  Examples included building hotel resorts in Queenstown and in the Great Barrier Reef, and the purchase of [[Fullers Ferries]].

By the mid 1980s Contiki was a global organisation headquartered in Hong Kong.  Anderson was living in New Zealand and travelled frequently for directors meetings and to review the company's operations.

===Sale of Contiki===
In the early 1980s Anderson sold down his investment in Contiki, allowing fellow directors to invest as shareholders.  In 1985 Omnicorp, a company controlled by [[Lloyd Morrison]] purchased a 50% stake in the business.

The [[Black Monday (1987)|stock market crash of 1987]] devalued many of Contiki's assets.  This, along with the poor performance of recent acquisitions, notably Fullers Ferries, placed Anderson in financial difficulty. In 1989 he was forced to sell his remaining shares in Contiki as well as his family home to avoid bankruptcy.

==After Contiki==
During the early 1990s Anderson was employed to sell off the assets of former Contiki empire.  His wife Ali returned to full-time work to supplement their income.  They briefly owned and ran a chain of stores&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nileguide.com/destination/auckland/restaurants/global-sandwich/1013153 ''Global Sandwich'' review]&lt;/ref&gt; in Auckland selling packaged sandwiches.  The business was short-lived and they moved to Blenheim in the late 1990s. Along with Contours Travel, John has started tours to South America for 'baby boomers'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celebrityspeakers.com.au/entrepreneur-speakers/john-anderson/ Speaker Profile of John Anderson at The Celebrity Speakers Bureau]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public speaking===
In recent years Anderson has taken up public speaking as a profession and has presented his Contiki story to many businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celebspeakers.com/john-anderson/ Celebrity Speakers biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Only Two Seats Left''===
In 2010 Anderson published ''Only Two Seats Left'', an autobiography that focuses mainly on his time with Contiki from 1961 to 1989.

== History ==
In 1851, the company was founded in the [[Alsace]] region of [[France]] by [[Léopold Louis-Dreyfus|Léopold Dreyfus]], the 18-year-old son of a farmer from [[Sierentz]], under the name of his father, Louis Dreyfus. Léopold purchased wheat from local farmers in Alsace and transported it to [[Basel]] in [[Switzerland]], {{convert|8|mi|km|order=flip}} away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ldcom.com/global/en/about-us/our-heritage/|title=Louis Dreyfus Company :: Our heritage|website=www.ldcom.com|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Léopold developed a fortune whilst still a teenager through cross border cereal trading. He rapidly diversified across shipping, [[weapons manufacturing]], agriculture, oil and banking, thus establishing one of the wealthiest dynasties in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''Saatchi &amp; Saatchi: The Inside Story'', By Alison Fendley, page 100, Arcade Publishing, 8 Oct 1996&lt;/ref&gt; His descendants still own the company to this day. By the early 20th century, the Louis-Dreyfus family was described as one of the "top five biggest fortunes of France". However, as a [[Jewish]] family during the Second World War much of the family assets were confiscated by the [[Vichy government]] and some members of the family fled to America.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Foreign Investment in the United States, 1914-1945'', Harvard University Press, 2004, By Mira Wilkins, page 479&lt;/ref&gt;

Léopold Louis-Dreyfus's great-grandson, [[Gérard Louis-Dreyfus]], was chairman of '''Louis Dreyfus Energy Services''', a subsidiary of the group involved in [[crude-oil trading]], gas investments and infrastructure. Gérard is also the father of American actress [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]], the Emmy-winning star of ''[[Seinfeld]]''. Another branch of the dynasty, based in Paris, was headed by [[Robert Louis-Dreyfus]] (who was also the CEO of [[Adidas]]) until his death in 2009. It is currently overseen by his widow, Russian-born [[Margarita Louis-Dreyfus|Margarita Bogdanova Louis-Dreyfus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bermant|first1=Yoel|title=Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, Head of Louis Dreyfus Holdings, Is Winning the Battle to Keep the Company in Family Hands|url=http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2013/04/28/margarita-louis-dreyfus-head-of-louis-dreyfus-holdings-is-winning-the-battle-to-keep-the-company-in-family-hands/|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third branch of the family's business is headed by Philippe Louis-Dreyfus (born 1945) and is concerned primarily with offshore industrial activities and freight shipping operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of Advisors|url=https://www.londoninternationalshippingweek.com/board-of-advisors/|website=London International Shipping Week|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''merit shop''' is term which refers to a firm or organization without a labor union.  Management retains the right to perform hiring, promotion, salary adjustments, bonuses and termination based on the laws of the state and federal government, along with its evaluation of individual's ability to accomplish the tasks assigned to them by the employer.  By Law, these decisions will not be biased by age, race, national origin, organizational affiliation, seniority, color, creed and sex.  The term "Merit Shop" was coined by John Trimmer, who served from 1952 to 1976 as an officer of the [[Associated Builders and Contractors]], an American trade association consisting primarily of non-union construction contractors.  In common usage, "merit shop" is often synonymous with being non-union or [[open shop]].

There are many other organizations that represent merit shop companies. For example, the [[Independent Electrical Contractors]] represents almost 3,000 open shop electrical and systems contractors in the USA, while also offering apprentice training, as recognized by the Department of Labor. Founded in 1957, the organization represents its member companies' small business and merit shop interests at the national, state, and local levels of government. 

Other merit shop-oriented associations include the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080115192502/http://www.meritshopcraftsmen.com/ Association of Merit Shop Craftsmen] and the Merit Shop Roundtable. 
 
A definition provided in ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law'' (1996) defines "merit shop" as a noun meaning “[[open shop]].”

'''Michael George Raymond Agostini''' (23 January 1935 – 12 May 2016) was a Trinidadian [[track and field]] athlete. He was the first athlete from his country to win a [[gold medal]] at what is now known as the [[Commonwealth Games]], when he won the [[Athletics at the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|100 yards final]] in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada, on 31 July 1954.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/more-sports/former-champion-sprinter-mike-agostini-has-died-at-the-age-of-81/news-story/929d54f89ee4d34b8401483974a37e7c |title= Former champion sprinter Mike Agostini has died at the age of 81 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=12 May 2016 |accessdate=17 May 2016 |author= Mike Hurst, David Tarbotton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TTG" /&gt;

== Early life ==
Michael Agostini was born on 23 January 1935 at [[Port-of-Spain]], Trinidad. His family had interests in sports: his father played football, his mother played hockey, and all his siblings participated in football and athletics events at St. Mary's College, where they studied.&lt;ref name="TTG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.guardian.co.tt/archives/2004-12-02/SA-7.html |title=Agostini’s gold – T&amp;T’s first |author=Bernard Linley  |date=1 December 2004|work=The Trinidad Guardian |accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Athletics career ==
Agostini participated in athletics, football, and boxing in his school days. In 1952, at Kingston, he defeated Jamaican sprinter [[Herb McKenley]], who had won one gold and two silver medals at the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Helsinki Olympics]]. On a scholarship, Agostini enrolled at [[Villanova University]], where he received training from [[Jumbo Elliott (coach)|Jumbo Elliott]].&lt;ref name="TTG" /&gt; On 23 January 1954, his 19th birthday,  he set a world indoor record for over 100 yards at Washington, beating Olympic champion [[Lindy Remigino]].&lt;ref name="IAAF" /&gt; The same year, he competed in the [[1954 Commonwealth Games]] at Vancouver, Canada, and won gold in the 100 yards race (9.6). He defeated Canadian [[Don McFarlane]] (9.7) and Australian [[Hec Hogan]] (9.7), becoming the first athlete from Trinidad and Tobago to win gold at the Commonwealth Games.&lt;ref name="TTG"/&gt; Hogan was then in the news for tying the world records of 100 yards (9.3) and 100&amp;nbsp;m (10.2) and was the most anticipated winner. Reports suggest that Hogan's performance was hampered after he was informed that Agostini had ironically stated in a pre-Games interview, "Who the heck is Hogan?" when questioned about him.&lt;ref name="TTG" /&gt;

In 1955 Agostini participated in the [[Pan American Games]] [[Athletics at the 1955 Pan American Games|held in Mexico]] and won a silver and a bronze in the 100&amp;nbsp;m and 200&amp;nbsp;m races, respectively.&lt;ref name="PAG"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/pag.htm |title= Pan American Games | accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also won silver at the [[Athletics at the 1959 Pan American Games|1959 Chicago Pan American Games]] in the 100&amp;nbsp;m, a bronze in the 200&amp;nbsp;m, and another bronze in the 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;100&amp;nbsp;m relay.&lt;ref name="PAG" /&gt;

In the next [[Athletics at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games at Cardiff]] in 1958, he stood third in the 100 yards run behind [[Keith Gardner]] of Jamaica and [[Tom Robinson]] of Bahamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/cg.htm|title= Commonwealth Games Medallists – Athletics (Men)|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agostini won another gold in the [[1959 British West Indies Championships]] in the 100&amp;nbsp;m and a bronze in the 200&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/bwic.htm |title= British West Indies Championships |accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agostini had also represented Trinidad and Tobago at the [[Athletics at the 1956 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metres|Men's 100&amp;nbsp;m]] and [[Athletics at the 1956 Summer Olympics – Men's 200 metres|Men's 200&amp;nbsp;m]] at the [[1956 Summer Olympics]], ranking 6th and 4th, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1956/ATH/mens-100-metres.html|title=Athletics at the 1956 Melbourne Summer Games: Men's 100 metres |accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1956/ATH/mens-200-metres.html |title= Athletics at the 1956 Melbourne Summer Games: Men's 200 metres |accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-retirement==
Agostini retired from active sports in the late 1950s. He graduated with a degree in [[economics]] from [[Fresno State University]], California, in 1958. In the late 1950s Agostini moved to Australia and married Pamela, with whom he had two daughters and two sons.&lt;ref name="IAAF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/news/iaaf-news/mike-agostini-obituary |title=Trinidadian sprint legend Agostini dies |work=[[International Association of Athletics Federations]] |date= 12 May 2016 |accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received Australian citizenship in 1961. He coached various sprinters, including [[Ralph Doubell]], [[Andrew Ratcliffe]], [[Peter Vassella]], and [[Jenny Lamy]].&lt;ref name="TTG" /&gt; He worked as a freelance journalist and as a teacher for a brief time, and also served as editor and publisher for ''Track and Field'' magazine in the mid-1960s. He edited numerous periodicals and authored nine books. In 2007, Mike Agostini was inducted into the [[Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fresnoahof.org/current-past-inductees|title=Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame {{!}} Home|website=Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame {{!}} Home|access-date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, he suffered from [[arthritis]] and [[pancreatic cancer]]. He died on 12 May 2016 of cancer in Sydney.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IAAF" /&gt;

'''Naum Alexandrovich Babaev''' ({{lang-ru|Наум Александрович Бабаев}}, [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: nɐ′um ɐlʲɪk′sandrɐvitɕ bɐ′baʲef) is a Russian entrepreneur, the founder of the Russian dairy company Rusmolco, a major raw milk producer, and the co-founder and joint owner of DAMATÉ group, a large agricultural holding specialising in poultry farming, dairy farming, and milk processing.

== Education and career ==
Naum Babaev was born in [[Kislovodsk]], [[Stavropol Krai]] on March 17, 1977, into the family of Rosa Michailovna and Alexander Naumovich Babaev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acdamate.com/en/naum-babaev|title=Naum Babaev|publisher=DAMATE Group/Группа компаний "Дамате"|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Аfter finishing high school in 1994, Naum entered the Financial Academy under the Government of the Russian Federation and graduated in 1999. Being a college undergraduate, he started off as a financial analyst at Cherkizovsky,&lt;ref name="Moscow Times 2014"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/qa-farming-pioneer-babayev-milks-at-520-cows-per-hour-32550|title=Farming Pioneer Babayev Milks at 520 Cows Per Hour|last=|first=|date=February 27, 2014|work=The Moscow Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a major Russian meat processing plant, which was subsequently reorganized into a JSC Group [[Cherkizovo]], Russia’s largest producer of meat products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thepoultrysite.com/poultrynews/39141/cherkizovo-group-ranks-as-russias-top-meat-producer/|title=Cherkizovo Group Ranks as Russia's Top Meat Producer|last=|first=|date=11 September 2017|work=The Poultry site|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Babaev took over as a head of the poultry production business unit in the company’s agro-industrial complex and was managing it until 2005, when, due to the merger of the company’s agro-industrial and meat processing units, a larger facility was formed, namely CHERKIZOVO Group; Naum was appointed the company’s Strategy and Development Director.

According to Vedomosti, the prominent Russian business daily, his achievements at the position were fully recognized with CHERKIZOVO’s IPO launch in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article/2007/01/17/119091/|title=Москва.

At the beginning of 2007, Babaev resigned to proceed on his own. Cherkizovo’s official statement marked his contribution to the Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cherkizovo.com/en/press/company-news/2163/|title=Management change in Cherkizovo Group|last=|first=|date=16 January 2007|website=Cherkizovo.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business ==
Rusmolco was established in October 2007, when Babaev started two mega dairy farms, from the ground up in [[Penza Oblast]] about 700&amp;nbsp;km south-east of Moscow.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moscow Times 2014" /&gt; By 2011 Rusmolco had become a major regional raw milk producer, doubling the average milk productivity in Russia at 9270&amp;nbsp;kg per cow&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ym-penza.ru/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=310:ministerskij-vizit&amp;Itemid=256|title=Министерский визит|last=|first=|date=29 April 2013|work="Улица Московская", Penza region|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; against the average 4500&amp;nbsp;kg, according to the data of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dairynews.ru/news/vladimir-labinov-vpered-i-vverkh-.html|title=Владимир Лабинов: "...Вперед и вверх!".

At the beginning of 2012, Rusmolco embarked on a strategic cooperation with a Singapore company [[Olam International]], a leading agri-business, operating in 70 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.agrimoney.com/news/olam-fuels-trading-house-rivalry-with-russia-deal-30521|title=Olam fuels trading house rivalry with Russia deal|last=|first=|date=30 January 2012|work=AgriMoney|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; OLAM invested $75 million in the deal, thereby attaining 75% of Rusmolco assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/olam-russia/singapores-olam-in-400-mln-russian-dairy-and-grains-partnership-idUSL4E8CU46320120130|title=Singapore's Olam in $400 mln Russian dairy and grains partnership|last=|first=|date=30 January 2012|work=Reuters|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partners announced their intention to form a large-scale dairy enterprise with $400 million investment capital (the initial 20-thousand milking herd was meant to reach up to 50 thousand heads in the short run).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/deal-makes-rusmolco-industry-leader-12257|title=Deal Makes Rusmolco Industry Leader|last=|first=|date=30 January 2012|work=The Moscow Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Russia’s agriculture secured a hefty chunk of investment, labeled in the mass media as being "unprecedented".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 2012, by a year-end estimation of the Institute for the Agricultural Market Studies, Rusmolco secured the fourth place among the five largest raw milk producers in the Russian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.souzmoloko.ru/news/pressa-o-nas/pressa-o-nas_1631.html|title=Млечный путь|last=|first=|date=September 2013|work=RBC Magazine. The article posted on the website of the National Union of Milk Producers (Soyuzmoloko)|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, shortly after the Olam International deal, Babaev undertook the effort to consolidate the leftover assets (namely, the turkey production plant, the PENZENSKY dairy complex as well as a veal-and-milk production facility in Penza and Tyumen regions, and 25K hectares of agricultural land.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.agroinvestor.ru/companies/article/12252-postroyat-rynok/|title=Построят рынок.

The Group’s priority was turkey meat production. At the time, turkey was not popular with the Russians; the average consumption per capita wobbled at 0, 8-1,0&amp;nbsp;kg, with the overall production hardly totaling 120-150 thousand tons per year.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.globalmeatnews.com/Article/2013/09/12/Rapid-growth-forecast-in-Russian-turkey-market|title=Rapid growth forecast in Russian turkey market|last=|first=|date=12 September 2013|work=Global MeatNews.com|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2016, Damaté became the largest turkey producing company in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.agroinvestor.ru/companies/news/24411-damate-obognala-evrodon-po-proizvodstvu-indeyki/|title="Дамате" обогнала "Евродон" по производству индейки|last=|first=|date=9 October 2016|work=«АгроИнвестор»|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.globalmeatnews.com/Headlines/Industry-Markets/Russia-s-largest-turkey-producer-sets-sights-on-expansion|title=Russia’s largest turkey producer sets sights on expansion|last=|first=|date=18 October 2017|work=Global MeatNews.com|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Agrifood Strategies data, in 2016, the company produced 60,800 tons of turkey in carcass weight.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vedomosti.ru/business/articles/2017/03/14/681014-damate-krupneishim-indeiki|title="Дамате" Наума Бабаева стала крупнейшим производителем индейки в России|last=|first=|date=14 March 2017|work=Ведомости|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Damaté leadership had also been confirmed by Rosptitsesoyuz, the Russian Union of Poultry Producers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

According to Vedomosti, "In the 10 years' span, the entrepreneur Naum Babaev made a profound career leap, from the top-manager of a major agro-holding to the owner of the largest turkey producer in Russia".&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vedomosti.ru/business/characters/2017/05/15/689912-naum-babaev|title="Мы не делаем ничего, что не едим сами"|last=|first=|date=16 May 2017|work=Ведомости|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2016, Damaté had been ranked among the top-25 largest meat producers in this country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.agroinvestor.ru/analytics/article/28459-lidery-myasnoy-industrii-top-25-krupneyshikh-proizvoditeley-myasa/|title=Лидеры мясной индустрии.

In 2012, Babaev acquired the dairy product plant Penzensky (MOLCOM), the largest processor of milk in Penza region with a cheese factory in Belinsky town.

At the end of 2013, Damaté, in partnership with food group [[Danone Group|Danone]], launched a high-powered production of the premium quality milk in Tyumen region, Western Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-danone-russia/danone-to-invest-in-russian-dairy-farms-idUSBRE9A00DQ20131101|title=Danone to invest in Russian dairy farms|last=|first=|date=1 November 2013|work=Reuters|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.just-food.com/news/danone-damate-sign-co-finance-dairy-deal_id124998.aspx|title=RUSSIA: Danone, Damate sign co-finance dairy deal|last=|first=|date=4 November 2013|work=Just-food|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 2017, Tyumen delivered its first tons of milk to Danone production facilities&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rusexporter.com/news/detail/5182/|title=One of the largest and most modern dairy complexes in Russia was opened in the Tyumen region|last=|first=|date=15 December 2017|work=Russian Exports National Information portal|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babaev owns Damaté on a par with the holding’s CEO Rashid Khairov. They had met in 1998, long before the Damaté endeavor. According to Vedomosti, in their current partnership, Babaev is implementing the strategic management of the firm, while Khairov is being responsible for the day-to-day management.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''Nelson Lévy''' (born ? - died June 3, 2007 [[Tahiti]]) was a leading figure in French Polynesia [[tourism]] and the founding head of [[Air Tahiti Nui]], the [[national airline]] of [[French Polynesia]].

==Career==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Tahiti Tourisme Logo.jpg|right|thumb| Levy headed Tahiti Tourisme in the 1990s.]] --&gt;
Levy originally began reporting as a [[journalist]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Pacific&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Nelson Levy, Tahiti Tourism Pioneer, Has Died |url=http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2007/06/05/nelson-levy-tahiti-tourism-pioneer-has-died |publisher=[[Pacific News Service]] |date=2007-06-05 |accessdate=2007-07-23 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Levy soon changed careers and began working in French Polynesia's booming [[tourism industry]].

In January 1992 Levy took over the [[management]] as head of [[Tahiti]] Tourism Promotion Office, which was the French Polynesia's main tourism [[marketing]] and information agency.&lt;ref name=Nui&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title= Air Tahiti Nui Press Release: Nelson Lévy, Founder of Air Tahiti Nui and one of Tahiti's modern tourism pioneers, dies at age 58
|url= http://www.airtahitinui-usa.com/company/presscontent.asp?id=77|work= [[Air Tahiti Nui]] press release |publisher= |date=2007-06-05 |accessdate=2007-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Levy helped transform the office into the present day [[GIE Tahiti Tourisme]].&lt;ref name=Nui/&gt; [[Tahiti Tourism]] is based in [[Papeete]] and currently operates a worldwide promotional and [[advertising campaign]] called, [[Tahiti and Her Islands]].&lt;ref name=Nui/&gt; Levy left Tahiti Tourisme  in August 1998 to become the first [[CEO]] of Air Tahiti Nui.&lt;ref name=Nui/&gt;

Levy helped found [[Air Tahiti Nui]] in 1996 as French Polynesia's international airline.  The airline  launched its first international  flights in 1998, the same year that Levy became Air Tahiti Nui's first [[CEO]].&lt;ref name=Nui/&gt;   Levy helped to guide the international expansion of the airline while CEO and earned a reputation for his managerial efficiency.  As CEO of Air Tahiti Nui, Levy was nominated in 2002 by [[Travel Agent Magazine]] for "Manager of the Year" in the [[Asia Pacific]] region.&lt;ref name=Pacific/&gt;

Levy was very well connected in the tourism industry, as well as in [[Politics of French Polynesia|French Polynesian politics]].  Levy was a prominent supporter of the [[Tahoeraa Huiraatira|Tahoeraa Huiraatira Party]], a pro-French political party which opposes independence for French Polynesia from [[France]].&lt;ref name=Pacific/&gt; He was replaced as CEO of the airline when the coalition of pro-independence parties led by [[Oscar Temaru]] took power in a surprise election victory.  However, Levy returned to the board of directors of Air Tahiti Nui following the 2005 presidential election win of French Polynesian President [[Gaston Tong Sang]], a pro-French candidate from the Tahoeraa Huiraatira Party.&lt;ref name=Pacific/&gt; Sang asked Levy back to help revive the ailing airline, which was suffering from "recurrent" financial shortfalls and problems.&lt;ref name=Pacific/&gt; (The [[Government of French Polynesia]] is a 61.7% [[shareholder]] in the airline.)

Additionally, Levy also served as head of the local French Polynesian post and [[telecommunications]] company, OPT.&lt;ref name=Pacific/&gt;

Levy's last tourism venture was the June 1, 2007, launch of '''easyTahiti.com''' [http://easyTahiti.com], a specialist travel [[web site]] for [[Tahiti]] and other French Polynesian islands.&lt;ref name=Nui/&gt; EasyTahiti.com has been described as "Tahiti's biggest virtual travel agency" in a [[press release]] from Air Tahiti Nui.&lt;ref name=Nui/&gt;

==Death==
Nelson Levy died unexpectedly of a [[heart attack]] on June 3, 2007, at his home in Tahiti,&lt;ref name=Nui/&gt; just two days after the official [[soft launch|launch]] of easyTahiti.com.  Levy had hosted [[barbecue]] for employees of easyTahiti.com at his home just hours before his death.&lt;ref name=Nui/&gt; His funeral took place in [[Papeete, Tahiti]] on June 6, 2007.&lt;ref name=Pacific/&gt; Levy was survived by his wife, Vaea, and two daughters, Vaiarava and Poerava.&lt;ref name=Nui/&gt;

{{Insolvency}}
A '''preferential creditor''' (in some [[jurisdiction]]s called a '''preferred creditor''') is a [[creditor]] receiving a preferential right to payment upon the debtor's [[bankruptcy]] under applicable insolvency laws.

In most legal systems, some creditors are given priority over ordinary creditors, either for the whole amount of their claims or up to a certain value. In some legal systems, preferential creditors take priority over all other creditors, including creditors holding [[security interest|security]], but more commonly, the preferential creditors are only given priority over [[unsecured creditor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liquidation: a guide for creditors|url=http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/pdflib.nsf/LookupByFileName/Liquidation_guide_for_creditors.pdf/$file/Liquidation_guide_for_creditors.pdf|publisher=Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some legal systems operate a hybrid approach; in the [[United Kingdom]] preferential creditors have priority over [[secured creditor]]s whose security is in the nature of a [[floating charge]], but creditors with fixed security take ahead of the preferential creditors generally.

In [[English law]] the concept was first introduced for personal bankruptcy in 1825 pursuant to the [[Bankrupts (England) Act 1825]], and for companies in 1888 pursuant to the [[Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Act 1888]].  Prior to that, all [[unsecured creditor]]s ranked equally and without preference ("''[[pari passu]]''") in a series of statutes stretching back to the [[Statute of Bankrupts|Statute of Bankrupts 1542]].

==Classes of preferred creditors==&lt;!-- [[First class creditor]], [[Second class creditor]], [[Privileged creditor]], and [[Third class creditor]] redirect here --&gt;

Creditors who are characteristically preferred creditors are:
* [[employee]]s: If a company goes bankrupt, the employees of that company will be first in line to be paid. If the company owes wages, this is considered to be the top priority when it comes to dissolving the company.
* [[tax|revenue authorities]]: When a government is owed taxes, they are on the top of the list to get paid. 
* in some countries, [[tort]] victims:  The rationale for tort victims is that they are perceived to be "involuntary" creditors of the bankrupt and thus should not be penalised by an insolvency in the same manner as parties who voluntarily became creditors of the bankrupt.
* in some countries, environmental clean-up costs: If a business files for bankruptcy and it is determined that they need to clean up the environment as a result of their business actions, the environmental clean up will get preferential treatment. The courts will allocate a designated amount of money to pay for the cleanup efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4 Types of Preferential Creditors|url=http://www.finweb.com/loans/4-types-of-preferential-creditors.html#axzz38pHy3eR3|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, employees’ holiday pay/wages are classed as preferential – if they are paid via [[redundancy payments]] fund then the [[Department of Employment]] becomes a secured creditor. If there is a shortfall, in those cases where someone earns in excess of the government limit, then they can claim preferentially too. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Mike|title=Company Liquidation: A Directors’ Guide to a Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidation|url=http://www.companydebt.com/liquidation/creditors-voluntary-liquidation/directors-guide|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right of the Crown as a preferential creditor was removed by the [[Enterprise Act 2002]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enterprise Act 2002|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/40/contents|website=Legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The Crown of United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creditors, and sometimes individual assets, are also placed in classes by specific laws for specific events, such as a [[deposit insurance]] scheme triggered by a bank failure. For example, [[Switzerland]]'s deposit protection has Class I (first-class), Class II (second-class) and Class III (third-class) unsecured creditors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.einlagensicherung.ch/en/home.htm Einlagensicherung]. ''Deposit Protection of Swiss Banks and Securities Dealers''. Retrieved 2008-10-09 (English)&lt;/ref&gt;
following are the preferential creditors:- 
1.all revenues, taxes, cesses and rates, whether payable to the Government or local authority, due to payment by the company with in 12 months before the date of commencement of winding up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Companies Act 1956|url=http://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/actsbills/pdf/Companies_Act_1956_Part_1.pdf|publisher=Government of India: Ministry of Corporate Affairs|accessdate=29 July 2014|date=18 Jan 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admiralty claims==
In [[admiralty law]], many legal systems accord certain claims preferential status where a ship is subject to arrest.  These claims vary from country to country, but commonly include:
* [[marine salvage|salvage]] claims
* seaman's wages
* moorage fees: Cost of mooring is often a preferential claim of expediency.  Otherwise it would be difficult to arrange mooring for vessels which are subject to arrest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34280">'''Space law''' encompasses national and [[international law]] governing activities in [[outer space]].  International lawyers have been unable to agree on a uniform definition of the term "outer space", although most lawyers agree that outer space generally begins at the lowest altitude above sea level at which objects can orbit the [[Earth]], approximately {{convert|122|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

The inception of the field of space law began with the launch of the world's first artificial satellite by the [[Soviet Union]] in October 1957.  Named ''[[Sputnik 1]]'', the satellite was launched as part of the [[International Geophysical Year]]. Since that time, space law has evolved and assumed more importance as mankind has increasingly come to use and rely on space-based resources.

== Early developments ==
At [[Caltech]] in 1942 [[Theodore von Kármán]] and other rocket scientists banded together to form [[Aerojet]] rocket company with the help of lawyer [[Andrew G. Haley]]. To toast the new corporation, Kármán said, "Now, Andy, we will make the rockets – you must make the corporation and obtain the money. Later on you will have to see that we behave well in outer space...After all, we are the scientists but you are the lawyer, and you must tell us how to behave ourselves according to law and to safeguard our innocence."&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew G. Haley]] (1963) ''Space Law and Government'', page xii, [[Appleton-Century-Crofts]]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, twenty years later Haley published the fundamental textbook, ''Space Law and Government''.{{citation needed|reason=citation needed both for the book, but also of a secondary source by a 3rd party declaring this "the fundamental textbook". Both need cited.|date=November 2017}}

Beginning in 1957 with the [[Space Race]], nations began discussing systems to ensure the peaceful use of outer space.&lt;ref name="inesap"&gt;[http://www.inesap.org/bulletin17/bul17art22.htm inesap.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318143550/http://www.inesap.org/bulletin17/bul17art22.htm |date=2008-03-18 }} Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and International Law.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/119/31/IMG/NR011931.pdf?OpenElement UN website] UN Resolution 1148 (XII). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814205448/http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/119/31/IMG/NR011931.pdf?OpenElement |date=August 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bilateral discussions between the United States and USSR in 1958 resulted in the presentation of issues to the UN for debate.&lt;ref name="inesap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SinghMacWhinney1989"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nagendra Singh|author2=Edward MacWhinney|title=Nuclear Weapons and Contemporary International Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r2IfMEpPUIsC&amp;pg=PA289|year=1989|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=90-247-3637-4|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/747/92/IMG/NR074792.pdf?OpenElement UN website] UN Resolution 1348 (XIII). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117022148/http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/747/92/IMG/NR074792.pdf?OpenElement |date=November 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, the UN created the [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space|Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]] (COPUOS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/COPUOS/copuos.html | title = United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space | publisher = United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; COPUOS in turn created two subcommittees, the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee and the Legal Subcommittee.  The COPUOS Legal Subcommittee has been a primary forum for discussion and negotiation of international agreements relating to outer space.

In 1960 the [[International Astronautical Congress]] met in Stockholm and heard several submissions including a survey of legal opinion on extraterrestrial jurisdiction by Andrew G. Haley.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew G. Haley (1961) "Survey of Legal Opinion on Extraterrestrial Jurisdiction",  in proceedings of the eleventh [[International Astronautical Congress]], Stockholm 1960, pp 37–92, Springer {{ISBN|978-3-662-37770-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 [[Yale University Press]] published ''Law and Public Order in Space'' by [[Myres McDougal]], [[Harold Lasswell]] and Ivan Vlasic.

== International treaties ==
Five international treaties have been negotiated and drafted in the COPUOS :

* The 1967 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (the "[[Outer Space Treaty]]").
* The 1968 Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space (the "[[Rescue Agreement]]").
* The 1972 Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (the "[[Liability Convention]]").
* The 1975 Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space (the "[[Registration Convention]]").
* The 1979 Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (the "[[Moon Treaty]]").

The outer space treaty is the most widely adopted treaty, with 104 parties.&lt;ref name="unoosa.org"&gt;http://www.unoosa.org/documents/pdf/spacelaw/treatystatus/AC105_C2_2016_CRP03E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The rescue agreement, the liability convention and the registration convention all elaborate on provisions of the outer space treaty.  UN delegates apparently intended{{according to whom|date=January 2011}} that the moon treaty serve as a new comprehensive treaty which would supersede or supplement the outer space treaty, most notably by elaborating upon the outer space treaty's provisions regarding resource appropriation and prohibition of territorial sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Journal of Space Law|journal=Journal of Space Law|year=1974|volume=2|url=http://www.spacelaw.olemiss.edu/JSL/Back_issues/JSL%202.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moon treaty has only 17 parties &lt;ref name="unoosa.org"/&gt; however, and many consider it to be a failed treaty due to its limited acceptance.&lt;ref name="ADL Legal"&gt;{{cite web|title=ADL Legal|url=http://www.dllegal.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=99&amp;Itemid=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; India is the only nation that has both signed the moon treaty and declared itself interested in going to the moon.  India has not ratified the treaty; an analysis of India's treaty law is required to understand how this affects India legally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space Law|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/49688551/International-Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the 1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space, and Under Water ("[[Partial Test Ban Treaty]]") banned the testing of nuclear weapons in outer space.

==International principles and declarations==
The five treaties and agreements of international space law cover "non-appropriation of outer space by any one country, arms control, the freedom of exploration, liability for damage caused by space objects, the safety and rescue of spacecraft and astronauts, the prevention of harmful interference with space activities and the environment, the notification and registration of space activities, scientific investigation and the exploitation of natural resources in outer space and the settlement of disputes." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/oosa/en/SpaceLaw/treaties.html |title= United Nations Treaties and Principles on Space Law. |author=United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs  |date= |work= |accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] adopted five declarations and legal principles which encourage exercising the international laws, as well as unified communication between countries. The five declarations and principles are{{citation needed|reason=United Nations Treaties and Principles on Outer Space: Travaux Préparatoires. http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/travaux-preparatoires.html=|date=November 2017}}:

:*The Declaration of Legal Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Uses of Outer Space (1963)
:All space exploration will be done with good intentions and is equally open to all States that comply with international law. No one nation may claim ownership of outer space or any celestial body. Activities carried out in space must abide by the international law and the nations undergoing these said activities must accept responsibility for the governmental or non-governmental agency involved. Objects launched into space are subject to their nation of belonging, including people. Objects, parts, and components discovered outside the jurisdiction of a nation will be returned upon identification. If a nation launches an object into space, they are responsible for any damages that occur internationally
:*Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (1979)  [[File:Apollo 15 flag, rover, LM, Irwin.jpg|thumb|Apollo 15 Moon landing. Jul 26, 1971 – Aug 7, 1971]]The agreement exists to promote the exploration of outer space but to keep the [[moon]] and other [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]] in pristine conditions for the common heritage of man, meaning that no nation may claim [[sovereignty]] over any part of space. All countries should have equal rights to conduct research on the moon or other celestial bodies.

All activities in space are required to be attached to a nation and any damages to other nations equipment or facilities caused by another party must be repaid in full to that nation. Any discovery of a dangerous hazard such as an area that is radioactive must notify the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary General]] and the greater international scientific community immediately.
:All missions in space lasting longer than 60 days must notify the UN [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary General]] and the greater scientific community every 30 days of progress.

:
:*The Principles Governing the Use by States of Artificial Earth Satellites for International Direct Television Broadcasting (1982)
:Activities of this nature must be transpired in accordance with the sovereign rights of States. Said activities should "promote the free dissemination and mutual exchange of information and knowledge in cultural and scientific fields, assist in educational, social and economic development, particularly in the developing countries, enhance the qualities of life of all peoples and provide recreation with due respect to the political and cultural integrity of States." All States have equal rights to pursue these activities and must maintain responsibility for anything carried out under their boundaries of authority. States planning activities need to contact the Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]] with details of the undergoing activities.

:*The Principles Relating to Remote Sensing of the Earth from Outer Space (1986)
:Fifteen principles are stated under this category. The basic understanding comes from these descriptions given by the [[United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs]]:
:(a) The term "remote sensing" means the sensing of the Earth's surface from space by making use of the properties of electromagnetic waves emitted, reflected or :diffracted by the sensed objects, for the purpose of improving natural resources management, land use and the protection of the environment;
:(b) The term "primary data" means those raw data that are acquired by remote sensors borne by a space object and that are transmitted or delivered to the ground :from space by telemetry in the form of electromagnetic signals, by photographic film, magnetic tape or any other means;
:(c) The term "processed data" means the products resulting from the processing of the primary data, needed to make such data usable;
:(d) The term "analysed information" means the information resulting from the interpretation of processed data, inputs of data and knowledge from other sources;
:(e) The term "remote sensing activities" means the operation of remote sensing space systems, primary data collection and storage stations, and activities in :processing, interpreting and disseminating the processed data.&lt;ref name="Declaration on International Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for the Benefit and in the Interest of All States, Taking into Particular Account the Needs of Developing Countries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/oosa/en/SpaceLaw/gares/html/gares_51_0122.html|title=United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812092122/http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/oosa/en/SpaceLaw/gares/html/gares_51_0122.html|archivedate=2011-08-12|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*The Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space (1992)
:"States launching space objects with nuclear power sources on board shall endeavour to protect individuals, populations and the biosphere against radiological hazards. The design and use of space objects with nuclear power sources on board shall ensure, with a high degree of confidence, that the hazards, in foreseeable operational or accidental circumstances, are kept below acceptable levels..."

:*The Declaration on International Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for the Benefit and in the Interest of All States, Taking into Particular Account the Needs of Developing Countries (1996)
:"States are free to determine all aspects of their participation in international cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space on an equitable and mutually acceptable basis. All States, particularly those with relevant space capabilities and with programmes for the exploration and use of outer space, should contribute to promoting and fostering international cooperation on an equitable and mutually acceptable basis. In this context, particular attention should be given to the benefit for and the interests of developing countries and countries with incipient space programmes stemming from such international cooperation conducted with countries with more advanced space capabilities. International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned, including, inter alia, governmental and non-governmental; commercial and non-commercial; global, multilateral, regional or bilateral; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development."

== Consensus ==
The [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]] and its Scientific and Technical and Legal Subcommittees operate on the basis of consensus, ''i.e.'' all delegations from member States must agree on any matter, be it treaty language before it can be included in the final version of a treaty or new items on Committee/Subcommittee's agendas. One reason that the U.N. space treaties lack definitions and are unclear in other respects, is that it is easier to achieve consensus when language and terms are vague.  In recent years, the Legal Subcommittee has been unable to achieve consensus on discussion of a new comprehensive space agreement (the idea of which, though, was proposed just by a few member States). It is also unlikely that the Subcommittee will be able to agree to amend the Outer Space Treaty in the foreseeable future.  Many space faring nations seem to believe that discussing a new space agreement or amendment of the Outer Space Treaty would be futile and time-consuming, because entrenched differences regarding resource appropriation, property rights and other issues relating to commercial activity make consensus unlikely.

== 1998 ISS agreement ==
In addition to the international treaties that have been negotiated at the United Nations, the nations participating in the [[International Space Station]] have entered into the [[Political and financial aspects of the ISS|1998 Agreement]] among the governments of Canada, Member States of the [[European Space Agency]], Japan, Russian Federation, and the United States concerning cooperation on the Civil International Space Station.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/reports/1998/IGA.html Space Station Agreement]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This agreement provides, among other things, that [[NASA]] is the lead agency in coordinating the member states' contributions to and activities on the space station, and that each nation has jurisdiction over its own module(s).  The agreement also provides for protection of intellectual property and procedures for criminal prosecution.  This agreement may very well serve as a model for future agreements regarding international cooperation in facilities on the Moon and Mars, where the first off-world colonies and scientific/industrial bases are likely to be established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space Law and Space Resources|url=http://www.nss.org/settlement/nasa/spaceresvol4/spacelaw.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National law==
Space law also encompasses national laws, and many countries have passed national space legislation in recent years.  The Outer Space Treaty gives responsibility for regulating space activities, including both government and private sector, to the individual countries where the activity is taking place.  If a national of, or an organization incorporated in one country launches a spacecraft in a different country, interpretations differ as to whether the home country or the launching country has jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/california-startup-accused-of-launching-unauthorized-sa-1823657316|title=California Startup Accused of Launching Unauthorized Satellites Into Orbit: Report [Updated]|first=George|last=Dvorsky|date=|website=gizmodo.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Outer Space Treaty also incorporates the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]] by reference, and requires parties to ensure that activities are conducted in accordance with other forms of international law such as [[customary international law]] (the custom and practice of states).

The advent of commercial activities like [[space mining]], [[space tourism]], private exploration, and the development of many commercial spaceports, is leading many countries{{Which|date=January 2011}} to consider how to regulate private space activities.&lt;ref name="Space Law"&gt;{{cite web|title=Space Law|url=http://www.dllegal.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=99&amp;Itemid=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge is to regulate these activities in a manner that does not hinder or preclude investment, while still ensuring that commercial activities comply with international law. The developing nations are concerned that the spacefaring nations will monopolize space resources.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Royalties paid to developing countries is one reason the United States has not ratified the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], and why some oppose applying the same principles to outer space.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Kristina.

Satellites in [[geostationary orbit]] must all occupy a single ring above the equator, approximately 35,800&amp;nbsp;km into space. The requirement to space these satellites apart means that there is a limited number of orbital "slots" available, thus only a limited number of satellites can be placed in geostationary orbit. This has led to conflict between different countries wishing access to the same orbital slots (countries at the same [[longitude]] but differing [[latitudes]]). These disputes are addressed through the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] allocation mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.martindale.com/legal-blogs/Legal_Management/b/law_articles/archive/2015/07/16/how-orange-county-attorneys-prosecute-dui-defendants.aspx ]&lt;/ref&gt; Countries located at the Earth's equator have also asserted their legal claim to control the use of space above their territory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/ECSL/SEM1691XDYD_0.html|title=Geostationary Orbit. Legal issues|author=esa|work=European Space Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably in 1976, when many countries located at the Earth's equator created the [[Bogota Declaration]], in which they asserted their legal claim to control the use of space above their territory.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J.

===Exploitation===

While this field of the law is still in its infancy, it is in an era of rapid change and development.  Arguably the resources of space are infinite.  If commercial space transportation becomes widely available, with substantially lower launch costs, then all countries will be able to directly reap the benefits of space resources.  In that situation, it seems likely that consensus will be much easier to achieve with respect to commercial development and human settlement of outer space. High costs are not the only factor preventing the economic exploitation of space: it is argued that space should be considered as a pristine environment worthy of protection and conservation, and that the legal regime for space should further protect it from being used as a resource for Earth's needs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Billings, L. (2006) To the Moon, Mars, and beyond: culture, law, and ethics in space-faring societies, Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society, 26(5), 430-437&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, K.

Philosophy and the Natural Environment, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 89-101&lt;/ref&gt;  Debate is also focused on whether space should continue to be legally defined as part of the “common heritage of man,” and therefore unavailable for national claims, or whether its legal definition should be changed to allow private property in space.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fountain, L.

[[File:Thomson Bonar's grave, St Cuthberts Churchyard, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Thomson Bonar's grave, St Cuthberts Churchyard, Edinburgh]]
'''Thomson Bonar''' (died 1814) was a wine-merchant who married Elizabeth, the daughter of the engraver [[Andrew Bell (engraver)|Andrew Bell]],&lt;ref&gt;The Great EB by Herman Kogan, University of Chicago Press, 1958, p. 28. Note in this reference his name is spelled Thomson Bonar&lt;/ref&gt; who co-founded the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' with [[Colin Macfarquhar]].

Bonar sold the 3rd through 5th editions of the ''Britannica'', and produced the supplement to the 3rd edition&lt;ref&gt;His name is clearly spelled Thomson Bonar, not Thomas, in the frontispage of the supplements to the 3rd edition of Britannica, 1803, Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bonar held the copyright for that supplement, for whose material he asked great sums (20,000 pounds sterling) in subsequent editions, although he was granted but little (100-200 pounds).  Bonar was friendly to the article authors, and introduced the policy of paying them as well as the article reviewers, and of allowing them to retain copyright for separate publication of their work.

Bonar quarreled with his father-in-law, Andrew Bell, and the two men did not speak from 1799 to 1809, when Bell died.  Bell's successor, [[Archibald Constable]], wisely bought out Bonar's copyright for the 5th edition and kept him as an ally of the ''Britannica''.

Thomson died on 25 July 1814, aged 75. He is buried in the northern section of [[St Cuthbert's Church, Edinburgh|St Cuthberts Churchyard]] in [[Edinburgh]]. The stone backs onto the access path from [[Princes Street]]. His grandson of the same name (1799-1861) is buried with him.

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Trademark infringement''' is a violation of the [[exclusive right]]s attached to a [[trademark]] without the authorization of the trademark owner or any licensees (provided that such authorization was within the scope of the licence). Infringement may occur when one party, the "infringer", uses a trademark which is identical or [[confusing similarity|confusingly similar]] to a trademark owned by another party, in relation to products or services which are identical or similar to the products or services which the registration covers. An owner of a trademark may commence civil [[lawsuit|legal proceedings]] against a party which infringes its registered trademark. In the United States, the [[Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984]] criminalized the intentional trade in counterfeit goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Irina D. Manta Spring 2011 [http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v24/24HarvJLTech469.pdf The Puzzle of Criminal Sanctions for Intellectual Property Infringement] Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology 24(2):469-518&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|485–486}}

If the respective marks and products or services are entirely dissimilar, trademark infringement may still be established if the registered mark is well known pursuant to the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention]]. In the United States, a cause of action for use of a mark for such dissimilar services is called [[trademark dilution]].

In some jurisdictions a party other than the owner (e.g., a licensee) may be able to pursue trademark infringement proceedings against an infringer if the owner fails to do so.

== Factors ==
Courts consider various factors in order to determine whether a trademark was infringed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-10-30|title=Rescuecom Corp. v. Google Inc.|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rescuecom_Corp._v._Google_Inc.&amp;oldid=807804980|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/13859|title=Rescuecom Corp. v. Google Inc.|website=h2o.law.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Whether the plaintiff has a valid trademark. A trademark can be valid because it is officially registered, or because it has a claim under common law.
* Whether the trademark is being used by the defendant. 
* Whether the defendant's use of the mark is "in commerce."
* Whether that use is connected to the sale, offer, distribution, or advertising of a product. 
* Whether the defendant's use of the trademark is likely to confuse consumers. 
This last factor, consumer confusion, is the main topic of debate in most cases. 

=== Consumer Confusion ===
Where the respective marks or products or services are not identical, similarity will generally be assessed by reference to whether there is a '''likelihood of confusion''' that consumers will believe the products or services originated from the trademark owner.

Likelihood of confusion is not necessarily measured by actual [[consumer confusion]] if two products do not directly compete against each other but are in proximate markets. Then, to determine consumer confusion, a court may apply one of various factor tests. The primary test comes from [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] and is found in ''AMF, Inc v. Sleekcraft Boats'', 599 F.2d 341 (C.A.9) 1979.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Court there announced eight specific elements to measure likelihood of confusion:
# Strength of the mark
# Proximity of the goods
# Similarity of the marks
# Evidence of actual confusion
# Marketing channels used
# Type of goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser
# Defendant's intent in selecting the mark
# Likelihood of expansion of the product lines&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tmcases/amf.htm AMF, Inc v Sleekcraft Boats, 599 F.2d 341 (C.A.9) 1979]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www3.ce9.uscourts.gov/jury-instructions/node/244|title=15.18 Infringement—Likelihood of Confusion—Factors—Sleekcraft Test {{!}} Model Jury Instructions|website=www3.ce9.uscourts.gov|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyber.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tm.htm|title=Overview of Trademark Law|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyber.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tmcases/polaroid.htm|title=Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elect. Corp., 287 F.2d 492 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 820 (1961).|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Courts have fashioned their own tests for likelihood of confusion—like those announced in ''In re E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co''., 476 F.2d 1357, 177 USPQ 563 (CCPA 1973)'',''&lt;ref&gt;[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-11th-circuit/1413742.html IN RE E.I. DuPONT DE NEMOURS &amp; COMPANY-BENLATE LITIGATION], 476 F.2d 1357 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; known collectively as the [[United States trademark law|''DuPont'' factors]].

== Defenses ==
The party accused of infringement may be able to defeat infringement proceedings if it can establish a valid ''exception'' (e.g., comparative advertising) or ''defence'' (e.g., [[Laches (equity)|laches]]) to infringement, or attack and cancel the underlying registration (e.g., for non-use) upon which the proceedings are based. Other defenses include [[Genericide|genericness]], functionality, [[Abandonment of trademark|abandonment]], or [[Fair use (U.S. trademark law)|fair use]]. 

== Globally ==
The [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement|ACTA trade agreement]], signed in May 2011 by the United States, Japan, Switzerland, and the EU, requires that its parties add criminal penalties, including incarceration and fines, for copyright and trademark infringement, and obligated the parties to actively police for infringement.&lt;ref name="Bitton"&gt;Miriam Bitton (2012) [http://www.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/backissues/v102/n1/1021_67.Bitton.pdf Rethinking the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement’s Criminal Copyright Enforcement Measures] The Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology 102(1):67-117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ige.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/Juristische_Infos/e/transparency_paper.pdf|title=The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement – Summary of Key Elements Under Discussion|date=November 6, 2009|work=transparency paper|publisher=Swiss federation of Intellectual Property|format=pdf|accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Xuan_p211"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bN3o1uwpKF4C&amp;dq=copyright+infringement+international+acta&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Intellectual property enforcement: international perspectives|last=Correa|first=Carlos Maria|author2=Li, Xuan|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-1-84844-663-2|pages=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries (but not in countries like the United States, which recognizes common law trademark rights), a trademark which is ''not'' registered cannot be "infringed" as such, and the trademark owner cannot bring infringement proceedings. Instead, the owner may be able to commence proceedings under the common law for [[passing off]] or [[misrepresentation]], or under legislation which prohibits [[unfair business practices]]. In some jurisdictions, infringement of [[trade dress]] may also be actionable.

== Notable cases ==
* ''[[Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc.]]'', case still pending
* ''[[Google, Inc. v. American Blind &amp; Wallpaper Factory, Inc.]]'', in which Google's AdWords program was alleged to be in violation of trademark
* ''[[Rescuecom Corp. v. Google Inc.]]'', in which the use of trademarks in Google's AdWords program was found to be a "use in commerce" under the Lanham Act
* ''[[Network Automation, Inc. v. Advanced Systems Concepts, Inc.]]'', in which the use of a competitor's trademark as an Internet advertisement search keyword was found to not constitute trademark infringement
* ''[[College Network, Inc. v. Moore Educational Publishers, Inc.]]'', in which the use of a competitor's trademark does not qualify as a "use in commerce" is upheld
* ''[[Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elects.]]''

On 6 April 2006 he was arrested as a suspected accomplice to tax evasion and money laundering.&lt;ref name=heared&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lepina, Marina|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=733994|script-title=ru:Василий Алексанян заслушал следователя|journal=[[Kommersant]]|volume=№ 1|issue=3557|date=January 15, 2007|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a decision by European Court of Human Rights, he was released on a bond on 12 January 2009, dying from complications of AIDS on 2 October 2011.

==Lawyer and businessman==
Vasily Aleksanyan graduated from the [[Moscow State University]] and the [[Harvard Law School|Law School]] of [[Harvard University]] as a [[Master of Laws]]. In 1992 through 1994 he worked for the USA law firm [[Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton]]. In 1995–1996 he was the head of the legal department for the British Investment firm [[SUN Group]]. Since 1996 he worked as the head of the legal department for [[Yukos]].&lt;ref name=kareera/&gt;

On 1 April 2006, amidst the legal troubles over Yukos company, his position was elevated to that of Executive Vice President.&lt;ref name=Kommersant6&gt;{{cite journal|author=Skornyakova, Anna|author2=Olga Pleshanova |author3=Yevgeniy Alekseev |url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=664057|script-title=ru:Новый вице-президент ЮКОСа успел сказать корпоративное управление|journal=[[Kommersant]]|volume=№ 60|issue=3391|date= April 6, 2006|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kommersant7&gt;{{cite journal|author=Trifonov, Vladislad|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=664463|script-title=ru:Генпрокуратура сложила президентские полномочия|journal=[[Kommersant]]|volume=№ 61|issue=3392|date=April 7, 2006|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; His new position was accepted by the shareholders on 4 April.&lt;ref name=zoominfo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoominfo.com/Search/PersonDetail.aspx?PersonID=410002248|title=Biography of Vasily Aleksanyan|publisher=[[ZoomInfo]]}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His main stated goal in the new role was to streamline the corporate governance, achieving direct control over the assets of the company from the [[London]] Yukos headquarters bypassing the [[Moscow]] based offices of [[Yukos RM]] and [[Yukos EP]]. The decision was quite important for the struggling company as the Moscow-based offices bluntly refused all the supervision from London obeying orders of the government-controlled [[Rosneft]] instead.&lt;ref name=Kommersant7/&gt; According to Aleksanyan, the lost control over the Moscow offices led to financial irregularities, including e.g. surfacing of counterfeit 10 billion [[Russian ruble|ruble]] [[promissory note]].&lt;ref name=Kommersant7/&gt;

On 6 April 2006 Aleksanyan was taken into custody as a suspected accomplice to tax evasion and money laundering by Yukos.&lt;ref name=heared/&gt; According to prosecutors, Aleksanyan was an accomplice to the [[embezzlement]] of more than 12 billion rubles.&lt;ref name=held&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2006/04/06/alexsanyan/|script-title=ru:Вице-президент "ЮКОСа" Василий Алексанян задержан|publisher=[[Lenta.Ru]]|date=April 6, 2006|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrest was based on the testimonies of [[Svetlana Bakhmina]], a subordinate of Aleksanyan arrested in 2004. According to Aleksanyan, Bakhmina's testimonies were false, and were taken from her under pressure.&lt;ref name=Kommersant7/&gt;

==In prison==

After his arrest Aleksanyan started a [[hunger strike]], insisting that his arrest without court hearings was illegal. He aborted his strike on 27 April 2006.&lt;ref name=RIAN&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rian.ru/society/20060502/47120067.html|script-title=ru:ФСИН подтверждает, что Василий Алексанян прекратил голодовку|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|date=May 2, 2006|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Aleksanyan's imprisonment, his health rapidly deteriorated due to [[HIV]]-related illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKL0748261720080207|title=Russia says will move AIDS prisoner to hospital|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date= February 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became almost blind and developed [[cancer]] of the [[liver]] with [[metastasis]] into the [[lymph node]]s. He also became ill with [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name=heared/&gt;&lt;ref name=politru/&gt;&lt;ref name=svoboda/&gt;&lt;ref name=lentalishili&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2007/12/27/grave/|script-title=ru:Бывшего вице-президента "ЮКОСа" лишили необходимого лечения|publisher=[[Lenta.Ru]]|date=December 27, 2007|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the grave medical situation demanding urgent [[Antiretroviral drug|antiretroviral treatment]] and [[chemotherapy]] in a hospital, he was denied both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Osadchuk, Svetlana|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2008/02/07/002.html|title=Trial Stops But Judges Won't Free Aleksanyan|work=[[The Moscow Times]]|date=February 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutors also ignored three injunctions by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] on 27 November 2007, on 6 December 2007 and on 20 December 2007.&lt;ref name=politru&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.polit.ru/news/2007/12/29/alex.html|script-title=ru:Смертельно больной менеджер ЮКОСа требует перевода из тюрьмы в больницу|publisher=[[Polit.Ru]]|date=December 29, 2007|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=svoboda&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.svobodanews.ru/news/2007/12/27.html?id=428019|script-title=ru:Василий Алексанян просит правозащитников о помощи|publisher=[[Radio Liberty]]|date=December 27, 2007|language=Russian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230191213/http://www.svobodanews.ru/news/2007/12/27.html?id=428019|archivedate=December 30, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aleksanyan, the prosecutors are demanding false evidence against other Yukos executives from him before starting his medical treatment. On 26 December Aleksanyan made public a statement asking for help from human rights advocates.&lt;ref name=politru/&gt;&lt;ref name=svoboda/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khodorkovsky.info/aleksanyan/ |accessdate=December 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916104559/http://www.khodorkovsky.info/aleksanyan/ |archivedate=September 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Echo of Moscow]]. 8 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 October 2008 Simonovsky Court of [[Moscow]] approved continuing pre-trial detention of Alexanyan despite his grave illnesses (he had [[cancer]], [[tuberculosis]]  and [[AIDS]] and his [[spleen]] was surgically removed).&lt;ref name=releasedlenta&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lenta.ru/news/2008/12/08/free1/|script-title=ru:Суд освободил бывшего вице-президента "ЮКОСа" Василия Алексаняна|publisher=[[Lenta.Ru]]|date=December 8, 2008|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=releasednews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsru.com/russia/08dec2008/alex_zalog.html|script-title=ru:Суд готов освободить смертельно больного Василия Алексаняна - под залог в $2 млн|publisher=[[NEWSru]]|date=December 8, 2008|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 December 2008 Moscow City Court reversed the decision of Simonovsky Court and decided to release Alexanyan under a bond of 50 million [[Russian ruble|rubles]] (approximately $2 million). He was to be released after the money was paid.&lt;ref name=releasedlenta/&gt;&lt;ref name=releasednews/&gt; Human rights advocates [[Lev Ponomaryov]] and [[Lyudmila Alexeyeva]] welcomed the court decision but expressed concern whether Alexanyan would be able to pay this sum of money.&lt;ref name=releasednews/&gt;

==Release and death==
On 22 December 2008 European Court of Human Rights made its decision over the ''Aleksanyan v. Russia'' case. The court found Russia in violation of four articles of [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and obliged Russia to release Alexanyan immediately without any bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Vasileva, Vera|url=http://hro1.org/node/4053|script-title=ru:Страсбургский суд принял решение по делу "Алексанян против России"|publisher=hro1.org|date=December 22, 2008|language=Russian|title=Archived copy|access-date=December 22, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225130323/http://hro1.org/node/4053|archive-date=December 25, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=844609&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649|title=Case of Aleksanyan v. Russia|publisher=[[European Court of Human Rights]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January 2009, after a bond of 50 million [[Russian ruble|rubles]] was paid,  Aleksanyan was released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/international/newsid_7834000/7834678.stm Алексанян выписан из больницы]&lt;/ref&gt; But he was repeatedly summoned to attend court hearings, where he wore a face mask and could barely stand up during the proceedings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11763">'''Virtual store research''' is an extension of the traditional methods of [[marketing research]].&lt;ref name="Burke"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Burke | first = Raymond R. | title = Virtual Shopping: Breakthrough in Marketing Research  | place =  | publisher = Harvard Business Review  | year = 1996 | edition =  | url =  | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; While marketing research employs techniques like focus groups, surveys and observation to better understand consumer decision-making, virtual store research uses these standard research techniques within a simulated store setting, delivered via computer. Virtual store research uses 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional [[computer simulation]] technology to create retail contexts that are as close to the real shopping experience as possible. This allows test consumers within the virtual environment to interact with store merchandise and make purchase decisions in a way that closely resembles real in-store behavior.

Additionally, virtual store technology can help consumer packaged goods companies and retailers make daily business decisions without the need for physically changing stores and products.

== History ==
Prior to the emergence of virtual store technology, the only way to get in-store behavioral data was through in-person store research. In-person store research is the acknowledged gold standard for testing the impact of changes in price, planograms, product packaging, or new products on consumer behavior. A controlled store test requires a change to be made in one set of stores but not in another similar set of stores. The sales results are then compared to determine if the change was beneficial. This approach is often paired with intercept research, which requires the researcher to station data collectors in actual stores and interrupt shoppers to ask questions about their shopping experience. These types of tests take place at the time of purchase and are widely considered to yield the most accurate insights about actual consumer behavior. However, they are very expensive and time consuming, and the tests themselves are considered by many shoppers and storeowners to be highly intrusive.&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt;

Virtual store research emerged as a more cost-effective alternative that could address the drawbacks of in-person store research through controlled simulations.

Methodologies for simulating a shelf set in a virtual environment first emerged in the 1990s, led by academic research labs like [[Harvard Business School]]’s Marketing Simulation Lab. In 1996, Harvard Business Review published a seminal article by Professor Raymond R. Burke called “Virtual Shopping: Breakthrough in Marketing Research,” which established empirically that “laboratory data can accurately predict the brand market share and consumer price sensitivity observed in the supermarket. Those predictions were most accurate when the simulation reproduced the visual cues that consumers used to make their purchase decisions.” His data indicated that virtual store sales correlate closely with sales in actual stores (correlation scores ranged from 0.90 for beauty categories to 0.94 for cleaning products in one test).&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt;

However, Burke was a decade early with his article. In a 2008 survey of researchers, only 3.7% of respondents reported using virtual testing techniques.  The reason for the slow initial adoption of virtual store research is that these tests were still performed in remote labs, requiring consumers to come to specific locations. Early adopter [[Kimberly-Clark]] was featured on the front page of The Wall Street Journal in 2007 for its use of virtual store technology in marketing research, but mainstream market penetration remained low.&lt;ref name="Letchford"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Letchford | first = Michael | title = Shaping Retail: The Use of Virtual Store Simulations in Marketing Research and Beyond  | place =  | publisher = In-Store Marketing Institute  | year = 2009 | edition =  | url = http://www.insightsinretail.com/virtual-stores/the-use-of-virtual-store-simulations-in-marketing-research-and-beyond/ | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For solution vendors virtual store technologies tend to fall into one of two categories:

*  Early market entrants took a realistic 3D shelf set out of the lab and allowed consumer testing in the field using a laptop running the technology. Respondents were recruited ad hoc at grocery stores to participate in tests.
* Others saw the Internet as a way to draw on larger samples more quickly and cost-effectively ad optimized 2D, rather than 3D, product images in a lightweight store simulation so that surveys could be executed efficiently through web browsers using the dial-up Internet connections still prevalent in the early 2000s.

In 2002, NORM Research &amp; Consulting, a shopper insight agency founded in Sweden, began the development of Simstore. Simstore is a technological platform and methodology for conducting virtual store research. It was developed in partnership with Arla Foods and the Stockholm School of Economics. NORM was one of the first agencies to offer a unique browser-based solution that enables the FMCG industry to easily test multiple scenarios by measuring actual shopping behaviour, using online panellists. Simstore started as an online 2D research tool and, in 2011, NORM added Simstore 3D solutions to the offer. NORM continues to challenge the market with new and innovative ways to conduct virtual store research and helps clients worldwide to get a better understanding of the complexity of shopper decision-making.

At the end of 2005, ACTIPLAY, a technology company based in France, with a history in Advergames, developed ACTISKU, one of the first online solutions to enable brands and research companies to test out new marketing concepts in a 3D virtual context using online panelists. Originally created for the Carlsberg group, the technical challenge was and remains, being able to keep the download times for panelists to a minimum while maintaining the highest levels of realism. Since then several versions have been launched, the latest including a powerful Shop Editor, allowing direct interaction with the 3D environments prior to creation of final consumer version. Comparing one 3D store environment against another helps brands understand which in-store concept work more effectively.

In 2005 FACTBOY, using ACTISKU technology, started selling online 3D virtual research and has grown knowledge and expertise with a high number of online shopper market research projects and became pioneers in this area with a serious number of project in the field. After moving to its own platform in 2007 and continuous platform improvements Factboy has today a performing platform and found a good trade off between performance and quality. FACTBOY based the on development on the 3D engine from Unity3D to ensure seamless web-player installation and content streaming in the background and provides the full production service to clients from store content collection up to data analytics.

In 2006, a new player called Red Dot Square Solutions emerged from the UK operating initially in the North American market. Red Dot's emphasis was on creating a complete virtual store fully stocked with 3-dimensional objects where shoppers could wander at will. Consumer product companies could then test multiple variables within the full virtual store environment. The company established a network of more than 60 on-site test centers to field research studies using [[eye tracking]] technology alongside virtual aisles where respondents interacted with touch screens to examine products. Red Dot Square Solutions was acquired by WPP in 2009.&lt;ref name="WPP"&gt;{{Citation  | last =  | first =  | title = WPP Press Release  | place =  | publisher =   | year = 2009 | edition =  | url = http://www.wpp.com/wpp/press/press/default.htm?guid={e8036603-77ba-4006-96f4-c03c6087983d} | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology is continually developing as companies were eager for the realistic experience of 3D environments combined with lower costs and quicker turnaround times.  As a result, in 2009, [[InContext Solutions]] developed a technology to stream data-rich, complex 3D objects over the Internet, the solution allowed consumer packaged goods companies to put their consumers in a realistic 3D in-store shopping context, yet still leverage the scalability of online research, enabling them to increase sample sizes, field studies anywhere in the world, and realize significantly faster project completion times while approximating the accuracy levels of in-person store research.

In 2012 all Factboy activities moved to the operational Team of Factboy and continues the service and solution under ShopperFact brand. ShopperFact and Factboy is managed by ShopperFact, Inc. ( a company owned by the operational, production and R&amp;D Factboy Team) with presence in New York, Miami, Cancun, Mexico City and Germany.

The long-term promise of virtual store research remains as articulated by Burke in 1996: “One day, the virtual store may become a channel for direct, personal, and intelligent communications with the consumer, one that encompasses research, sales and service.”&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt;

== Usage ==
'''Marketing research'''

Virtual store technology is generally used to answer questions regarding customer decisions within an in-store setting. This includes all of the following:
* New product placement
* Packaging changes
* Pricing studies
* In-store marketing levers, including displays, promotions and messaging
* [[Merchandising]] strategies
* [[Planogram]] or shelf-set changes
* In-store events
* Product or category findability studies

'''Integration with point of sale data'''

In 2011, InContext Solutions introduced Visualize InContext, a software tool that allows companies to view actual point-of-sales data within the virtual store environment. Through Visualize InContext, marketers and retailers can see in real time what is happening on the shelf, enabling them to tune their shelf restocking schedules and better optimize planograms for the most efficient product sell–through using actual point-of-sale data.

'''Fusion with Online Shopping'''
In 2017, Buzz 3D introduced their Buzz 3D Retail Suite, which as well as providing 3D Planogram creation, Store Planning and Virtual Store Research functions, leveraged 3D Cloud functionality to permit live access to the Virtual Store from any video-capable device. By defining products within the store individually, and making it simple and cost-effective to create from photography, retailers now have a means of selling through a Virtual Store in addition to just conducting research studies alone.

'''Additional applications'''

Virtual store technologies have additional applications as visualization tools for internal marketing and product development efforts, including the following:
* Collaboration between manufacturers and suppliers for package design and product development
* Collaboration between manufacturers and retail partners
* Visualization of in-store marketing and promotional ideas within marketing departments
* Virtual store displays to showcase products at trade shows or with outside partners
* As a visualization aid for professional sales forces
