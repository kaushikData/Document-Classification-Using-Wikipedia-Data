The '''Italian Plague of 1629–31''' was a series of outbreaks of [[bubonic plague]] which ravaged [[northern Italy|northern]] and [[central Italy|central]] Italy. This [[epidemic]], often referred to as the '''Great Plague of Milan''', claimed possibly one million lives, or about 25% of the population.&lt;ref name= "Hays"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hays|first1=J. N.|title=Epidemics and pandemics their impacts on human history|date=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=978-1851096589|page=103}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This episode is considered one of the later outbreaks of the centuries-long [[Second plague pandemic|pandemic of bubonic plague]] which began with the [[Black Death]].

==Outbreaks==
[[Germany|German]] and [[France|French]] troops carried the plague to the city of [[Mantua]] in 1629, as a result of troop movements associated with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Plague and Pestilence: From Ancient Times to the Present|last=Kohn|first=George C.|publisher=Facts on File|year=2007|isbn=|edition=3rd|location=New York|pages=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] troops, infected with the disease, retreated into northern and central Italy, spreading the infection.

In October 1629, the plague reached [[Milan]], Lombardy's major commercial center. Although the city initiated effective public health measures, including [[quarantine]] and limiting the access of German soldiers and trade goods, the plague smoldered. A major outbreak in March 1630 was due to relaxed health measures during the [[carnival]] season. This was followed by a second wave in the spring and summer of 1631. Overall, Milan suffered approximately 60,000 fatalities out of a total population of 130,000.

East of Lombardy, the Republic of Venice was infected in 1630–31. The city of [[Venice]] was severely hit, with recorded casualties of 46,000 people out of a population of 140,000. Some historians believe the drastic loss of life, and its impact on commerce, ultimately resulted in the downfall of Venice as a major commercial and political power. The [[Papal States|papal]] city of [[Bologna]] lost an estimated 15,000 citizens to the plague, with neighboring smaller cities of [[Modena]] and [[Parma]] also being heavily affected. This outbreak of plague also spread north into [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]], an alpine region of western [[Austria]] and northern Italy.

Later, outbreaks of bubonic plague in Italy include the city of [[Florence]] in 1630–33 and the areas surrounding [[Naples]], [[Rome]] and [[Genoa]] in 1656–57.

==Literature==
The 1630 plague in Milan is the backdrop for several chapters of [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s 1840 novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' ({{lang-it|I promessi sposi}}). Although a work of fiction, Manzoni's description of the conditions and events in plague-ravaged Milan are completely historical and extensively documented from primary sources researched by the author.

An expunged section of the book, describing the historical trial and execution of three alleged "plague-spreaders", was later published in a pamphlet entitled ''Storia della colonna infame'' (History of the pillar of infamy).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8321">'''Abortion in Trinidad and Tobago''' Abortion is a very serious issue in the nation of Trinidad and Tobago. These laws are very different from those in the United States, and have been in place for approximately 90 years. An abortion is one of the most common surgical procedures in Trinidad and Tobago, and most occur during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Glennis |last1=Hyacenth |first2=Crystal |last2=Brizan |date=2012 |title=The case of unsafe abortion in Trinidad and Tobago: an NGO perspective|issue=3 |pages=167–186 |via=General OneFile |url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A356351988/GPS|url-access=subscription|journal=Social and Economic Studies|volume=61|jstor=4180377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laws ==
Trinidad and Tobago was an island nation under British rule until 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/countries/trinidad-and-tobago|title=Trinidad and Tobago - Countries - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, many of their statutes replicate those in the UK, including the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861 which states abortion is illegal.

The UK case of Rex v. Bourne of 1938 is highly influential, even to this day, in Trinidad and Tobago abortion laws. Dr. Bourne was tried under the Offences Against the Person Act for administering an abortion to a 15 year old that had been raped by a group of soldiers. In this case, the prosecution’s duty was to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the operation was not performed in good faith for the well-being of the girl. The judge ruled that it was Bourne's responsibility as a doctor to terminate the pregnancy if, on reasonable grounds and with adequate knowledge, he was of the persuasion that the end result of the pregnancy would lead to deterioration of the girl’s physical and/or mental health. Thereafter, Bourne was acquitted. (5)

In the island nation of Trinidad and Tobago, the Offences Against the Person Act of April 3, 1925 stated that abortions are illegal.

Abortion is only permitted if it will:
* Save the life of the woman
* Preserve physical and/or mental health
Permission to abort is not permitted for
* Rape or incest
* Fetal impairment
* Economic or Social reasons
* Available upon request&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Trinidad and Tobago |chapter-url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/trinidad.doc |format=Word document |title=Abortion Policies: A Global Review |url=http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/ |publisher=United Nations Population Division}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The punishment for a woman who has an [[abortion]] is four years in prison, and the punishment for a doctor or other person who performs the procedure is the same. Aiding in the process of finding someone to perform an abortion or other preliminary steps is also illegal, and subject to a two-year prison sentence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Unsafe Abortions and Impacts ==

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an unsafe abortion is "a procedure for terminating an unwanted pregnancy either by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment lacking the minimal medical standards or both".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Unsafe abortions in Trinidad &amp; Tobago have led to increased rates of maternal morbidity and hospital visits.

In Trinidad and Tobago the maternal mortality rate (MMR) is 55 per 100,000 live births.

Although the law states that abortion is allowed to save a woman's mental health, the law does not give a clear definition of what mental health issues are covered under this law. Therefore, it can be difficult for health practitioners, lawyers, and midwives to judge when the law should be followed as far as mental health is concerned. For this very reason, many doctors are hesitant to perform abortions, and costs are very high.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women who can afford expensive but safe abortions at private practices and hospitals are the only ones who remain unaffected. The lack of safe resources has forced women who are either young or poor to seek out cheaper, life-threatening methods to terminate unwanted pregnancies, where they eventually end up in the hospital. A well-known drug known as Cytotec, or Misoprostol is used to conduct unsafe, but cheap abortions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=Cedriann J |last2=Hyacenth |first2=Glennis |last3=Suite |first3=Lynette Seebaran |title=Knowledge and Perception of Abortion and the Abortion Law in Trinidad and Tobago |journal=Reproductive Health Matters |volume=15 |issue=29 |year=2007 |pages=97–107 |issn=0968-8080 |doi=10.1016/S0968-8080(07)29301-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a widespread issue that is so common that the majority, if not all public hospitals have an entire ward set aside for women suffering from unsafe abortion complications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The complications that stem from underground abortions cost a whopping 1 million TT dollars per month.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Treatment includes surgery, blood transfusions, medications, and overnight stays (20). Unsafe abortions can lead to sepsis, hemorrhage, cervical complications, or uterine perforations,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; with the most historically common problems in emergency rooms being sepsis and hemorrhage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The women that do not seek out medical attention have issues with infertility, pelvic problems including pelvic inflammatory disease and chronic pelvic pain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Current Views ==
Although abortion is not permitted, other methods of contraceptives such as oral contraceptives, condoms, and tubal ligation are widely used and accepted. It appears that over the counter contraceptives have also become popular since the 90s. Today, oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and male and female condoms are available for free at public health institutions.

The Trinidadian government is connected to the Catholic Church, and many laws are based on Christian commandments. The Billings Ovulation Method of Natural Fertility Regulation has stated they operate under the Catholic Church’s Archdiocesan Family Life Commission.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henry|first=Susan|date=2012|title=7. Trinidad|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A299885055/AONE|url-access=subscription|journal=Bulletin of Ovulation Method Research &amp; Reference Centre of Australia|volume=39|pages=29+|via=Academic OneFile}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church, and therefore the government believe sexual intercourse serves only the purpose of connecting marriage and/or conceiving babies. An alternative solution to legalizing all abortions known as the Billings Ovulation Method has been proposed from the church alongside the Billings Ovulation Method of Natural Fertility Regulation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This method suggests women should observe symptoms in her body that indicate whether she is fertile or infertile, and this will determine whether or not the couple should engage or abstain in sexual activities.

Advocates for Safe Parenthood: Improving Reproductive Equity (ASPIRE) is a non-profit organization in Trinidad and Tobago that advocate for abortion law reform, better sexual education in schools, and contraceptive delivery services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They were the first organization to consistently strive to fight the government’s views and laws on abortion rights and established in 1999.They have participated in conducting studies on women’s health records concerning abortion, created model policies and laws, public media campaigns, and surveys over the past decade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Related Issues ==
The United Nations reports that there has been a decline in the 90s of contraceptive usage due to access and supply limitations. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago also think that fertility and population rates are too high.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

His distinguished career was cut short by his premature death at the age of 35.&lt;ref name="  RCS_bio" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://livesonline.rcseng.ac.uk/biogs/E002409b.htm|title=Kanthack, Alfredo Antunes - Biographical entry - Plarr's Lives of the Fellows Online|work=rcseng.ac.uk|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="  HRC" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.histonroadcemetery.org/graves/CAMBRIDGE%20LIVES/AlfredoKanthack.html|title=Histon Road Cemetery|work=histonroadcemetery.org|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Alfredo Antunes Kanthack was born on 4 March 1863 in [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]], the second son of Emilio Kanthack, and lived in Brazil until he was six years old when his father's business took the family firstly to Germany in 1869, and then to Liverpool in 1881.&lt;ref name =  RCS_bio /&gt; His father subsequently returned to Brazil as [[Consul (representative)|British Consul]] at [[Pará]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/25598/page/2909|title=Page 2909 - Issue 25598, 18 June 1886 - London Gazette - The Gazette|work=thegazette.co.uk|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
From 1871-1881 he went to school in Germany, first in Hamburg and then in [[Wandsbeck]], [[Lüneburg]], and [[Gutersloh]].&lt;ref name =  RCS_bio /&gt;

After moving to England in 1881, aged 18, he went to [[Liverpool College]] for a few months and then in 1882 became a student at [[University of Liverpool#University College Liverpool|University College, Liverpool]], where his academic brilliance became apparent, passing the matriculation exams for the [[University of London]] with [[Honours degree|honours]].&lt;ref name =  RCS_bio /&gt;

In 1887 he went to [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]], London, to study medicine and was awarded a Gold Medal in obstetrics.&lt;ref name =  RCS_bio /&gt;

In 1889 he continued his studies in Berlin under Wilhelm Krause; cellular pathologist [[Rudolf Virchow]]; and pioneering microbiologist and founder of modern bacteriology, [[Robert Koch]], who received a [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1905/ Nobel Prize in 1905] for his groundbreaking research on [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name =  RCS_bio /&gt; His studies in Germany demonstrated his accurate observation and original thought in the field of research.&lt;ref name =  RCS_bio /&gt;

==Career==
Returning from Berlin in 1890 he served as Obstetric Resident at St Bartholomew's Hospital&lt;ref name =  RCS_bio /&gt;
[[File:Map showing the distribution of Leprosy in India Wellcome L0039112.jpg|thumb|Map by Alfredo Kanthack showing the increase and decrease of Leprosy in India since 1881. Wellcome L0039112]]
While holding this position he was appointed by the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]], [[Royal College of Physicians]], and the Executive Committee of the National Leprosy Fund as one of the Special Commissioners to investigate the prevalence and treatment of [[leprosy]] in India.&lt;ref name =  RCS_bio /&gt;&lt;ref name =  HRC /&gt; Among his conclusions were that direct contagion was at the most a very small factor in causing the spread of leprosy, and that compulsory segregation of lepers was not advisable.&lt;ref name =  RCS_bio /&gt;

On his return from India in 1891 he matriculated at Cambridge as a Fellow [[Commoner (academia)|Commoner]] of [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]]. At the same time he was appointed [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/27th-november-1886/14/the-john-lucas-walker-studentship John Lucas Walker Student in Pathology], a scholarship given for original pathological research, under which he studied immunity.&lt;ref name =  RCS_bio /&gt;

In 1892 he left Cambridge and began to practise as a physician in Liverpool. He was appointed Medical Tutor and Registrar at the Liverpool Royal Infirmary where he set up a Bacteriological Laboratory,&lt;ref name =  HRC /&gt; Senior Demonstrator of Bacteriology in a post specially created for him, and also Medical Tutor at University College, Liverpool.&lt;ref name =  RCS_bio /&gt;

[[File:St. Bartholomew's Hospital, 1896. Wellcome M0010860.jpg|thumb|St. Bartholomew's Hospital, 1896. Kanthack is standing in white coat. &lt;br&gt;Wellcome Images]]
In 1893 he returned to St Bartholomew's as Director of the Pathological Department in the Medical School and Hospital, Lecturer on Pathology and Bacteriology, and Curator of the Museum.&lt;ref name =  RCS_bio /&gt;

In 1894 he suffered from a severe attack of [[typhoid fever]], but in spite of this won the prestigious Royal College of Surgeons' [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2312237/ Jacksonian Prize] in 1895 for his essay ''The Aetiology of Tetanus and the Value of the Serum Treatment.''&lt;ref name =  RCS_bio /&gt;

In 1896 he acted as Deputy to Professor Charles Roy, who had been appointed to the new Chair in Pathology at Cambridge&lt;ref name=CamPath&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.path.cam.ac.uk/about/history.html |title=Department of Pathology |work=cam.ac.uk |accessdate=24 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205195249/http://www.path.cam.ac.uk/about/history.html |archivedate=5 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was unable to take up the post due to ill-health. This required Kanthack to travel to and from St Bartholomew's and the University. In the spring of 1897 he moved to Cambridge where he was given an honorary MA and elected a Fellow of [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]]. In the autumn he succeeded Roy as Professor of Pathology at the age of 34.&lt;ref name =  RCS_bio /&gt;

During the autumn of 1898 the report of his research on the [[tsetse fly]], conducted by him in conjunction with [[Herbert Durham]] and [http://www.bate.ox.ac.uk/assets/files/WALTER%20FIELDING%20HOLLOWAY%20BLANDFORD.pdf Walter Blandford], was published. This report cleared the ground for further investigation of what was then known as tsetse-fly disease, although no method of prevention or cure was yet propounded&lt;ref name =  RCS_bio /&gt; His last work, in conjunction with Dr Sydney Sladen, reported on tuberculous milk.&lt;ref name =  RCS_bio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2801%2979094-0/abstract|title=INFLUENCE OF THE MILK SUPPLY ON THE SPREAD OF TUBERCULOSIS,|accessdate=24 March 2015 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)79094-0|volume=153|journal=The Lancet|pages=74–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before his death he recommended one of his promising students, [[Walter Myers (physician)|Walter Myers]], for a John Lucas Walker scholarship.

Kanthack is credited for the use of [[formalin]] as a [[histological]] fixative.&lt;ref name = CamPath/&gt;

==Death==
He died of cancer on 21 December 1898 aged 35. After his funeral in [[Kings College Chapel]], he was buried at [[Histon Road Cemetery]], Cambridge.&lt;ref name =  HRC /&gt;

After his death his wife donated funds in his memory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Kanthack Memorial Fund|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=1994|pages=689|pmid=20758376|pmc=2462566|year=1899|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.1994.689-a}}&lt;/ref&gt; to establish a library in the Pathology Department which still bears his name,&lt;ref name =  HRC /&gt;&lt;ref name = CamPath/&gt; and a bronze memorial plaque was placed at the entrance in Tennis Court Road.&lt;ref name =  HRC /&gt;

A sum of money was collected after his death to establish  ''The Kanthack Memorial Library''  in the Pathological Institute of St Bartholomew's Hospital.&lt;ref name =  RCS_bio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=2462566 |title=The Kanthack Memorial Fund|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=1994|pages=689|year=1899|pmid=20758376|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.1994.689-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Kanthack Medal'' has been awarded at Liverpool since 1900 for experimental pathology and microbiology, reflecting the importance of his work there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/doves/liverpool1900/bronze_medal_mcnair.aspx|title=University College Liverpool: Kanthack Medal, Charles J Allen and James Herbert McNair|work=liverpoolmuseums.org.uk|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Health Lawyers Association''' ('''AHLA''') is a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[professional association]] for attorneys and other professionals in the [[healthcare]] field.  Its membership numbers approximately 12,500.&lt;ref name="health"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.healthlawyers.org/Pages/Default.aspx | title=The American Health Lawyers Association | accessdate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AHLA was created on July 1, 1997, through the merger of the two pre-eminent existing membership associations for health lawyers: the National Health Lawyers Association (NHLA) and the American Academy of Healthcare Attorneys (AAHA) combined into a single organization, AHLA.  AHLA is headquartered at 1620 Eye Street NW, [[Washington, D.C.]] 20006-4010.

==Mission==
Its mission is "to provide a collegial forum for interaction and [[information exchange]] to enable its members to serve their clients more effectively; to produce the highest quality nonpartisan educational programs, products, and services concerning [[health law]] issues; and to serve as a public resource on selected healthcare legal issues."&lt;ref name="health" /&gt;

==Formation==
The roots of AHLA can be traced back to 1967 when the [[American Hospital Association]] (AHA) created a membership association for hospital [[attorney at law|attorney]]s to encourage communication and education about  hospital legal issues--the American Society for Hospital Attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthlawyers.org/About/WhoWeAre/Pages/AHLA_History.aspx |title=AHLA History |accessdate=April 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519080818/http://www.healthlawyers.org/About/WhoWeAre/Pages/AHLA_History.aspx |archivedate=May 19, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society eventually became the American Academy of Healthcare Attorneys (the “Academy”)and grew to a membership of 3,300 attorneys, approximately one-third of whom were [[in-house counsel]] at hospitals, health plans, and other entities in American health care; attorneys from private law firms and government agencies constituted the balance of the membership .  The Academy sponsored major educational programs and publications, and remained a component of the AHA until it combined with the National Health Lawyers Association in 1997.

The National Health Lawyers Association (NHLA) was formed in 1971 as a nonprofit educational organization whose membership included health attorneys who represented [[hospital]]s, [[physician]]s, [[managed care]] organizations, [[Home health care|home health agencies]], and [[Long-term care facility|long term care facilities]].  Over time, the NHLA grew to over 8,500 members, producing educational programs and publications, including the [[Health Law Digest]].

In 1996, leaders of the Academy and NHLA began discussions about merging the two organizations whose missions had grown together as the healthcare landscape changed over time with vertical integration and common issues.  On July 1, 1997, NHLA and the Academy merged, adopting an interim name "NHLA/AAHA."  In 1998, its name was changed to the American Health Lawyers Association.

The '''Battle of Malakal''' occurred at the end of November 2006 in the southern [[Sudan]]ese town of [[Malakal]]. The clashes between Sudanese government forces and the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] were the most serious breach of a 2005 deal to end the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]].&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSMCD05502620061201 "Hundreds killed in south Sudan clashes: ex-officer"], Reuters, November 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
According to the SPLA, militia leader [[Gabriel Tang]] initiated the clashes by attacking the SPLA and then taking refuge in the local Sudanese Army base. After a demand to hand over Tang was not met, the SPLA attacked the base, causing the Sudanese army to counterattack with tanks. The Sudanese army likewise blamed the SPLA for starting the battle. After three days of fighting the battle eventually subsided, and both sides agreed to disengage to their pre-battle positions.&lt;ref name=reuters /&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Tang's militia would clash with the SPLA again in Malakal in 2009 and in [[Jonglei]] in 2011,&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13182109|title=South Sudan clashes between army and militia kill 57|publisher=BBCnews.com|accessdate=2011-04-26|date=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; before eventually surrendering to the SPLA shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sudantribune.com/South-Sudan-Renegade-Gabriel,38774&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 clash didn't escalate to a dangerous level, and the [[South Sudanese independence referendum, 2011|2011 South Sudanese independence referendum]] was held as planned and according to the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] of 2005, resulting in [[South Sudan]]'s independence.

'''Beare–Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome''' is a rare genetic disorder characterized by [[craniosynostosis]] (premature fusion of certain bones of the skull, sometimes resulting in a characteristic 'cloverleaf skull'; further growth of the skull is prevented, and therefore the shape of the head and face is abnormal) and a specific skin abnormality, called [[Cutis verticis gyrata|cutis gyrata]], characterized by a furrowed and wrinkled appearance (particularly in the face and on the palms and soles of the feet); thick, dark, velvety areas of skin ([[acanthosis nigricans]]) are sometimes found on the hands and feet and in the groin.&lt;ref name=GHR&gt;http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/beare-stevenson-cutis-gyrata-syndrome The Genetic Home Reference entry on Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hall BD, Cadle RG, Golabi M, Morris CA, Cohen MM | title = Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome  | journal = Am J Med Genet | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 82–89 |date=September 1992 | pmid = 1519658 | doi=10.1002/ajmg.1320440120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional signs and symptoms of Beare–Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome can include a blockage of the nasal passages ([[choanal atresia]]), overgrowth of the umbilical stump, and abnormalities of the genitalia and anus. The medical complications associated with this condition are often severe and may well be life-threatening in infancy or early childhood.

==Genetics==
Several mutations in the FGFR2 gene (a gene coding for a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, which is involved in important signaling pathways) are known to cause Beare–Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome;&lt;ref name="Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome"/&gt; however, not all patients with the condition have a mutation in their FGFR2 gene. Any alternative underlying causes are currently unidentified. The syndrome follows an [[autosomal]] [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] pattern, meaning that if one of the two available genes carries a mutation the syndrome will result. Currently, no familial histories are known (in other words, there are no reports of cases in which a parent carrying a mutation in their FGFR2 gene then propagated said mutation to his or her child).

==Incidence==
Beare–Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome is so rare that a reliable incidence cannot be established as of yet; fewer than 20 patients with the condition have been reported.

'''''Brugia timori''''' is a human [[filariasis|filarial]] [[parasite|parasitic]] [[nematode]] (roundworm) which causes the disease "Timor [[filariasis]]." While this disease was first described  in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;David, H.L. and J.F. Edeson (1965) Filariasis in Portuguese Timor, with observations on a new microfilaria found in man.  ''Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology''  59:193-204.&lt;/ref&gt; the identity of ''Brugia timori'' as the causative agent was not known until 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Partono, F., D.T. Aennis, Atmosoedjono, S., Oemijati, S., and J.H. Cross (1977) ''Brugia timori'' sp.n. (Nematoda: Filarioidea) from Flores Island, Indonesia.  ''Journal of Parasitology''  63(3):540-546.&lt;/ref&gt;  In that same year, ''[[Anopheles barbirostris]]'' was shown to be its primary [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]].&lt;ref&gt;Atomosoedjono, S., F. Partono, D.T. Dennis, and Purnomo (1977) ''Anopheles barbirostris'' (Diptera: Culicidae) as a vector of the Timor filaria on Flores Island: Preliminary observations.  ''Journal of Medical Entomology''  13(4-5):611-613.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no known animal reservoir host.

==Characteristics of ''Brugia timori''==

The microfilariae of ''Brugia timori'' are longer and morphologically distinct from those of ''Brugia malayi'' and ''Wuchereria bancrofti'', with a [[cephalic]] space length-to-width ratio of about 3:1.  ''B. timori'' more closely resembles the symptoms caused by ''B. malayi'' and morphologically resembles ''B. malayi''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"Lymphatic Filariasis Endemic Countries and Territories." Lymphatic Filariasis Disease. May 2006. The Carter Center. 13 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the sheath of ''B. timori'' does not stain pink with Giemsa stain as is observed with ''B. malayi'' and ''W. bancrofti''.&lt;ref&gt;Purnomo, D.T. Dennis, and F. Partono (1977) The microfilaria of ''Brugia timori'' (Partono et al. 1977 = Timor microfilaria, David and Edeson, 1964): Morphologic description with comparison to ''Brugia malayi'' of Indonesia.  ''Journal of Parasitology''  63(3):1001-1006.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Inside the mosquito the microfilariae penetrate the midgut and migrate to muscle tissue to grow and undergo two molts into infective filariform larvae (no sexual reproduction occurs within the mosquito)
# The filariform larvae will migrate to the mouthparts of the mosquito
# Larvae enter the host's circulation and migrate to lymphatic vessels where they develop into microfilariae-producing adults. Here the adults can live for several years

==''Brugia timori'' filariasis==

Like other human [[filariasis]] infections, ''Brugia timori'' filariasis causes acute [[fever]] and chronic [[lymphedema]]. The life cycle of ''Brugia timori'' is very similar to that of ''[[Wuchereria bancrofti]]'' and ''[[Brugia malayi]]'', leading to nocturnal periodicity of the disease symptoms. Eosinophilia is common during acute stages of infection.

So far ''Brugia timori'' has only been found in the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]] of [[Indonesia]].  It is locally confined to areas inhabited by its [[mosquito]] vector, which breeds in [[rice fields]].  One study of the prevalence of infection in Mainang village, [[Alor Island]], found microfilariae in the blood of 157 of 586 individuals (27%), with 77 of them (13%) exhibiting lymphedema of the leg.&lt;ref&gt;Supali, T., H. Wibowo; P. Rückert, K. Fischer, I.S. Ismid, Purnomo, Y. Djuardi, and P. Fischer (2002) High prevalence of ''Brugia timori'' infection in the highland of Alor Island, Indonesia.  ''American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene''  66(5):560-565.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morphology ==
''B. timori'' microfilariae have nuclei that extend to the tip  of the tail, which is also characteristic of ''B. malayi'' but not ''W. bancrofti''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;''B. timori'' microfilariae are slightly larger than ''B. malayi'' microfilariae.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Endosymbiont ==
Aside from vectoring ''Brugia'' species, mosquitoes also maintain ''Wolbachia'' spp. which has been found to be an obligate intracellular bacterial endosymbiont of ''Brugia'' spp.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''Wolbachia'' supports essential biochemical pathways necessary for the survival of ''Brugia'', especially processes such as embryogenesis and molting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Treatment==

[[Anthelmintics]] such as [[diethylcarbamazine]] and [[albendazole]] have shown promise in the treatment of ''Brugia timori'' filariasis.&lt;ref&gt;Oqueka, T., T. Supali, I.S. Ismid, Purnomo; P. Rückert, M. Bradley, and P. Fischer (2005) Impact of two rounds of mass drug administration using diethylcarbamazine combined with albendazole on the prevalence of ''Brugia timor'' and of intestinal helminths on Alor Island, Indonesia.  ''Filaria  Journal''  4(1):5 [http://www.filariajournal.com/content/4/1/5]&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers are confident that ''Brugia timori'' filariasis may be an [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradicable disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, P., T. Supali and R.M. Maizels (2004) Lymphatic filariasis and ''Brugia timori'': Prospects for elimination.  ''Trends in Parasitology''  20(8):351-355.&lt;/ref&gt; Related filarial nematodes have been found highly sensitive to elimination of their endosymbiotic [[Wolbachia]] bacteria, and this may be a powerful attack route against ''Brugia timori'' as well.

Newborns have very immature and small  [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive system]]s, and colostrum delivers its nutrients in a very concentrated low-volume form. It has a mild [[laxative]] effect, encouraging the passing of the baby's first [[Human feces|stool]], which is called [[meconium]].  This clears excess [[bilirubin]], a waste-product of dead red blood cells, which is produced in large quantities at birth due to blood volume reduction from the infant's body and helps prevent [[jaundice]]. Colostrum is known to contain immune cells (as [[lymphocytes]])&lt;ref&gt;https://www.womenshealth.gov/itsonlynatural/addressing-myths/myths-in-the-african-american-community.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=1792611 |title=Lymphocytes bearing the T cell receptor gamma delta in human breast milk |date=1 November 1990 |pmid=2147370 |volume=65 |issue=11 |journal=Arch Dis Child |pages=1274–5 |doi=10.1136/adc.65.11.1274-a | last1 = Bertotto | first1 = A | last2 = Castellucci | first2 = G | last3 = Fabietti | first3 = G | last4 = Scalise | first4 = F | last5 = Vaccaro | first5 = R}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[antibodies]] such as [[IgA]],  [[IgG]], and [[IgM]].  These are some of the components of the adaptive immune system.

==In animal husbandry==
Colostrum is crucial for newborn farm animals.  They receive no passive transfer of immunity via the placenta before birth, so any antibodies that they need have to be ingested (unless supplied by injection or other artificial means). The ingested antibodies are absorbed from the intestine of the neonate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balfour | first1 = W. E. | last2 = Comline | first2 = R.

Colostrum varies in quality and quantity. In the dairy industry, the quality of colostrum is measured as the amount of IgG ([[Immunoglobulin G]]) per liter. It is recommended that newborn calves receive at least 4 quarts (liters) of colostrum with each containing at least 50 grams of IgG/liter. Testing of colostral quality can be done by multitude of devices including colostrometer, optical refractometer or digital refractometer. Mature dairy cattle produce an average of 33 liters of colostrum in the first milking after calving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Devery-Pocius, J.E. et al.|title=Age and Previous Lactations as Factors in the Amount of Bovine Colostral Immunoglobulins1

Livestock breeders commonly bank colostrum from their animals. Colostrum can be stored frozen but it does lose some of its inherent quality. Colostrum produced on a breeder's own premises is considered to be superior to colostrum from other sources, because it is produced by animals already exposed to (and, thus, making antibodies to) pathogens occurring on the premises. A German study reported that [[multiparous]] [[mares]] produced on average a liter (quart) of colostrum containing 70&amp;nbsp;grams of IgG.&lt;ref name="pmid18277781"&gt;{{cite journal

In most [[dairy cow]] herds, the calves are removed from their mothers soon after birth and fed colostrum from a bottle.

==Human consumption of bovine colostrum==

Although many claims of health benefits have been made for colostrum consumption in adults, until recently there have been limited randomized trials to support these assertions. It is probable that little absorption of intact growth factors and antibodies into the bloodstream occurs, due to digestion in the gastrointestinal tract.  However, the presence of casein and other buffering proteins does allow growth factors and other bioactive molecules to pass into the lumen of the small intestine intact, where they can stimulate repair and inhibit microbes, working via local effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Playford|first=R.

Dairy cattle are naturally exposed to pathogens and produce immunoglobulins against them. These antibodies are present in the cow’s bloodstream and in the colostrum. These immunoglobulins are specific to many human [[pathogens]], including ''[[Escherichia coli]], [[Cryptosporidium parvum]], [[Shigella flexneri]], [[Salmonella]] ''species'', [[Staphylococcus]]'' species,&lt;ref name="McConnell2001"&gt;{{Cite journal

The gut plays several important roles including acting as the main pathway for fluid, electrolyte and nutrient absorption while also acting as a barrier to toxic agents present in the gut lumen including acid, digestive enzymes and gut bacteria. It is also a major immunological defence mechanism, detecting natural commensals and triggering immune response when toxic microbes are present. Failure of homeostasis due to trauma, drugs and infectious microbes not only damages the gut but can lead to influx of damaging agents into the bloodstream. These mechanisms have relevance for multiple conditions affecting all areas of the world and socioeconomic groups such as ulcers, inflammation, and infectious diarrhoea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baumgart|first=Daniel C.|last2=Dignass|first2=Axel U.|date=1 November 2002|title=Intestinal barrier function|journal=Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care|volume=5|issue=6|pages=685–694|doi=10.1097/01.mco.0000038813.16540.3b|issn=1363-1950|pmid=12394645|via=|doi-broken-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently much interest in the potential value of colostrum for the prevention and treatment of these conditions as it is derived from natural sources and can influence damaging factors through multiple pathways including nutritional support, immunological intervention (through its immunoglobulin and other anti-microbial factors) and growth/healing factor constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Playford|first=R.

===Hyperimmune colostrum===
Hyperimmune colostrum is natural bovine colostrum collected from a population of cows immunized repeatedly with a specific pathogen.  The colostrum is collected within 24 hours of the cow giving birth. Antibodies towards the specific pathogens or antigens that were used in the immunization are present in higher levels than in the population before treatment.  Although some papers have been published  stating that specific human pathogens were just as high as in hyperimmune colostrum, and natural colostrum nearly always had higher antibody titers than did the hyperimmune version &lt;ref name="McConnell2001"/&gt; clinical trials &lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Francis Scand J Gastroenterol. 2011 Jul; 46(7-8): 862–868. doi:  [10.3109/00365521.2011.574726]PMCID: PMC3154584 PMID: 21526980&lt;/ref&gt;have shown that if the immunization is by surface antigens of the bacteria,the Bovine Colostrum Powder &lt;ref&gt;TGA guidance BCP&lt;/ref&gt;can be used to make tablets capable of binding to the bacteria so that they are excreted in stools. This prevents the successful colonization of the gut, which would otherwise lead to bacteria releasing enterotoxigenic materials.

=== Proline-rich polypeptides ===

'''David A. Schauer''', [[ScD]], [[Certified Health Physicist|CHP]], is [[Executive Director Emeritus]] of the [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] (NCRP). During his tenure a number of updated and new publications were issued by [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements|the Council]].

==Biography==
Schauer received his doctor of science ([[Doctor of Science|Sc. D.]]) degree from [[Johns Hopkins University]] and is a diplomate of the [http://www.hps1.org/aahp/abhp/abhp.htm American Board of Health Physics]. He received [[Master of Science|M.S.]] and [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degrees from [[Georgetown university|Georgetown]] and [[Liberty university|Liberty]] Universities, respectively. Prior to being elected NCRP secretary and treasurer, and appointed Executive Director (2004 to 2012), Dr. Schauer served in various scientific and leadership positions as an officer in the [[U.S. Navy]] (1984 to 2004). His primary research interests include [[Thermoluminescent Dosimeter|thermoluminescent dosimetry]] and [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] [[biodosimetry]]. He is a member of numerous organizations including the [[American Society of Association Executives]], the [[American College of Radiology]], and the [http://www.hps.org/ Health Physics Society].

Schauer has published a number of scientific articles, proceedings and reports individually and in collaboration with fellow scientists and students. He also contributed book chapters to the "Handbook of Radioactivity Analysis" published by [[Elsevier]] Academic Press (2003) and "Advances in Medical Physics: 2012" published by Medical Physics Publishing (2012).

==Early years==
Schauer’s formal education began in 1965 with the creation of President Johnson’s [[Head Start Program]].  This was part of Johnson’s War on Poverty. As one of five children being raised in a single-parent home, Schauer was sent to the newly established Head Start Program in Williamstown, NJ.  So began Schauer’s formal education which would include a stop in a two-room schoolhouse for kindergarten ([[Hall Street School|Hall Street]]) and culminate at [[Johns Hopkins University|Hopkins]] with the awarding of his doctorate in 1994.

==College years and beyond==

|}
Following graduation from [[Williamstown High School (New Jersey)|Williamstown High School]] (1979) where he was named scholar athlete, Schauer was recruited to pitch at [[Liberty University]].  Schauer was used mostly as a starter and set the single game record for strikeouts until a hard-throwing lefthander ([[Randy Tomlin]] – Pittsburgh Pirates and pitching coach for the AA Harrisburg Nats) arrived a few years later and established a new mark.  During his years at Liberty, Schauer was coached by former major league pitcher, [[Al Worthington]], and played with [[Sid Bream]], [[Lee Guetterman]] and Darrell Manuel (youngest brother of Phillies manager, [[Charlie Manuel]]).  The [[Liberty University|Liberty]] baseball teams of the early 1980s made three successive trips to the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] college world series in Lubbock, TX.

Following graduation from Liberty in 1983, Schauer was commissioned as an ensign in the [[U.S. Navy Medical Corps|US Navy Medical Service Corps.]]  Ensign Schauer worked his way up the ranks before retiring at the beginning of 2004 as a [[Commander]].  During those 20 years, Schauer served in various leadership positions in San Diego, CA, Portsmouth, NH and Bethesda, MD.

'''Dentistry throughout the world''' is practiced differently, and training in [[dentistry]] varies as well.

== Australia ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Australian dentistry is overseen by the Australian Dental Council and the [[Dental Board of Australia]] The professional body for dentists is the [[Australian Dental Association]].
Dentists trained in [[Australia]] must meet the entry requirements of one of the Australian institutions offering dental courses, and then complete the required full-time academic training leading to a [[dental degree]]. If dentists wish to specialize, they must complete extra study after having had clinical experience.

In order to practice dentistry in Australia (as of July 2010) you must obtain registration and licensing from the nationalized Dental Board of Australia. Generally, the only persons immediately entitled to apply to be registered as dentists are persons holding the qualifications of DDS, BDS, BDSc, BDent, BDentSc, DMD, MDent, or GradDipDent from an accredited Australian and New Zealand university. Usually registration will not be granted to a foreign graduate until he or she has passed the ADC examinations and/or completed a 2-year [[advance standing]] program in order to obtain a locally accredited dental qualification

The [[University of Queensland|Universities of Queensland]], [[University of Adelaide|Adelaide]], [[University of Western Australia|Western Australia]], Griffith, James Cook, Charles Sturt and Latrobe all offer undergraduate dental degree courses of 5 years in length. [[University of Sydney|Sydney University]] offers a graduate entry program which is 4-years duration and requires a previous bachelor's degree for admission. Melbourne University also has a 4-year graduate entry dental program starting in 2011. The qualifications awarded by these schools satisfy the formal academic requirements for registration.

Admissions to an undergraduate dental school in Australia is often known as the most difficult admissions among other countries. 
Only 1% of all qualified applicants yearly pass the Australia's dental school admissions and get entry into dentistry programs.

Australian dental schools include but are not limited to: 
*[[University of Adelaide]]
*[[University of Melbourne]]
*[[University of Queensland]]
*[[University of Sydney]]
*[[University of Western Australia]]
*[[La Trobe University]]
*[[Griffith University]]
*[[James Cook University]]
*[[Charles Sturt University]]

== Brazil ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
The first step to become a dentist in Brazil is to take a 10-subject examination (Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Literature, one of the 5 main Languages offered by the institutions, Portuguese, History, Geography and an Essay) which might be compared to the SAT exam in the US. These examinations vary from institution to institution; however, odontology is one of the hardest courses to get in and most students come from upper classes due to the level of difficulty and steep tuition prices. Students must complete the 5-year Bachelor of Dental Surgery (B.D.S.). Skills capacitation courses after graduation are required in different dental areas, which take between 2 and 3 years (D.D.S). Universities of dental care are provided by both the private and public sector. The course's conclusion must be registered and licensed by the nationalized Dental Board of Brazil so that the students obtain the Dentistry Certificate. However, private clinics are the most common place a person would go if a dentist is needed. Today, the private market is dominated by large companies that hire mostly recently graduated dentists. Nevertheless, there are thousands of small clinics spread throughout the country. The practice of dentistry in Brazil is overseen by CFO ''Conselho Federal de Odontologia'', a federal entity that coordinates the 27 state bodies. This institution has 340,000 registered dentists and 191 universities and/or colleges in Brazil. Brazil has become a leading country at the international level in areas such as Dentistry International Research, implantology, Periodontics, Endodontic, Protesis, Aesthetics Dentistry, Pediatric Dentistry, Orthodontics and Functional Jaw Orthopaedics, and Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery. The Brazilian Dentistry Department develops, all over the country, many innovative techniques and conducts dentistry research related to different aspects. Dentists in the [[Mercosur]] are eligible to work in Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and Peru.

== Canada ==
{{main article|Dentistry in Canada}}
The practice of dentistry in Canada is overseen by the [[National Dental Association Examination Board of Canada (NDAEB)]], while specialization is overseen by the [[Royal College of Dentists]]. Today, Canada has about 16,000 dentists. Canadian dentistry is not publicly run (see [[Medicare (Canada)]]); however, some provinces [http://www.cda-adc.ca/jcda/vol-66/issue-5/246.html] provide for free dental care for children and the elderly. Other Canadians are mostly covered by workplace dental plans, but many have to pay [[Out-of-pocket expenses|out-of-pocket]].

For most of the early colonial period dentistry was a rare and unusual practice in Canada. In severe situations, barbers or blacksmiths would pull a tooth, but for many years Canada lagged behind European advances. The first dentists in Canada were [[United Empire Loyalists]] who fled the [[American Revolution]]. The first recorded dentist in Canada was a Mr. Hume who advertised in a [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] newspaper in 1814.

During the first half of the 19th century, dentistry expanded rapidly. In 1867 the [[Ontario Dental Association]] was formed and in 1868 they founded Canada's first dental school in [[Toronto]], the [[Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario]]. The [[University of Toronto]] agreed to be affiliated with the dental school. As time passed, other Canadian universities also created dentistry programmes. However, the [[Faculty of Dentistry, U of T|University of Toronto]] still has the largest dental school in Canada that features the most postgraduate research opportunities as well as certifications for all the dental specialties. The UBC Faculty of Dentistry supports five specialty programs being [[Prosthodontics]], [[Endodontics]],  [[Orthodontics]], [[Pedodontics]] and [[Periodontics]].

Dental care is not covered by the [[Healthcare in Canada|Canadian health care system]], as it is in many other countries with public health care, although public dental services have long been provided to certain categories of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/17818|title=The Political Eeconomy of Dentistry in Canada|first=Quiñonez,|last=Carlos|date=25 September 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, studies have estimated that at least 6 million Canadians avoid going to a dentist because of the cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/nursing/2016/05/06/nurse-champions-access-to-dental-care-for-at-risk-kids.html|title=Nurse champions access to dental care for at-risk kids - Toronto Star|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chile ==
In Chile dentists require six years of post secondary education which, after 2 years dedicated to fundamental scientific and medical knowledge (chemistry, physics, biology, morphology, anatomy, histology etc.) puts a particular emphasis on practice and the accountability to patients in the last 4 years. Specialization programs of 3 – 4 years (admission by competition) are possible after a minimum of 3 years' working experience has been completed. The first dental school was established at the [[Universidad de Chile]] in the year 1888. Other institutions providing professional dental education in Chile are [[Universidad Austral de Chile]] since 2004, [[Universidad de Concepción]] since 1919, [[Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile]] (since 2009), [[Universidad de Valparaíso]] since 1952, [[Universidad de la Frontera]] (since 1992), [[Universidad de Talca]], which are public universities, and the following private universities: [[Universidad Finis Terrae]], [[Universidad Nacional Andrés Bello]], [[Universidad Mayor]], [[University of the Andes, Chile|Universidad de los Andes]], [[Universidad Diego Portales]], [[Universidad del Desarrollo]], [[Universidad San Sebastián]] and [[Universidad de Antofagasta]].
After having been influenced for decades by both the European (especially from German-speaking countries) and North American dentistry, Chilean education and practice in dentistry has now reached a self-sufficient level and benefits from a range of top-level institutes, professors and practitioners. Research has developed at a fast pace and many articles find their path to international publications.

== Finland ==
In Finland, education in dentistry is through a 5.5 year ''Licenciate of Dental Medicine'' (DMD or DDS) course, which is offered after high school graduation. Application is by a national combined dental and medical school entry examination. As of 2011, dentistry is provided by Faculties of Medicine in 4 universities:

*[[University of Helsinki]]
*[[University of Turku]]
*[[University of Oulu]]
*[[University of Eastern Finland]], Kuopio Campus

1st phase of training begins with a unified 2 year pre-clinical training for dentists and physicians. Problem-based learning (PBL) is employed depending on university. 3rd year autumn consists of clinico-theoretical phase in pathology, genetics, radiology and public health and is partially combined with physicians' 2nd phase. 3rd phase clinical training lasts for the remaining 3 years and includes periods of being on call at University Central Hospital Trauma Centre, Clinic of Oral and Maxillofacial Diseases and at the Children's clinic. Candidates who successfully complete the 4th year of training qualify for a paid summer rotation in a [[Community health center]] of their choice. Annual intake of dentists into Faculties of Medicine is a national total 160 students.

[[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] research is strongly encouraged and is mandatory alongside post graduate training. Post graduate training is available in all 4 universities and lasts an additional 4–6 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.helsinki.fi/hammas/opiskelu/HL0709.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, dentists earn either a D.D.S. ([[Doctor of Dental Surgery]]) or D.M.D. ([[Doctor of Dental Medicine]]) degree. There is no difference in the training for either degree. The degrees are equivalent, and recognized equally by all state boards of dentistry. There are 56 accredited dental schools in the United States requiring 4 years of post graduate study (except for one unique 3-year program at the University of the Pacific).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228172756/http://www.ada.org/prof/ed/programs/search_ddsdmd_us.asp |archivedate=February 28, 2009 |title=DDS/DMD Programs - U.S. |website=American Dental Association |url=http://www.ada.org/prof/ed/programs/search_ddsdmd_us.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most applicants to dental school have attained at least a B.S. or B.A. degree, but a small percentage are admitted after only fulfilling specific prerequisite courses. So unlike many other countries (other than US, Canada, and Australia), it usually takes more than 8 years to become a dentist. The difference relates to the history involved in the division of medicine and surgery in medical practice.

Licensure is organized on three levels in most areas. Many dentists must pass National Boards, Regional Boards, and then take a jurisprudence exam accepted by their state to fulfill their requirements to get a state license. Not all states require or even accept regional boards. Although a state license is only valid in the issuing state, because of the regional boards a dentist may be able to apply for licensure in any other state within the jurisdiction of their regional board. There are many cooperative agreements between states that allow recognition of another state's license so as to procure a license either via "licensure by credentials" or "licensure by reciprocity."  Although a national licensure exam has yet to be made, the [[American Dental Association]] (ADA) has worked with education and examining groups to form such an exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ada.org/prof/resources/pubs/adanews/adanewsarticle.asp?articleid=1760 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061204002458/https://www.ada.org/prof/resources/pubs/adanews/adanewsarticle.asp?articleid=1760 |archivedate=2006-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dentist may go on for further training in a dental specialty which requires an additional 1 to 7 years of post-doctoral training. There are 9 recognized dental specialties.  These include [[Endodontics]] (root canal treatment), Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, Pediatric Dentistry, [[Periodontics]] (gums), [[Prosthodontics]] (complicated dental reconstruction), [[Orthodontics]] (moving teeth), Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (surgery of the mouth and face), and Dental Public Health. There is no specialty in esthetic dentistry or implantology, and no additional training is required for a dentist to make the claim of being an esthetic or cosmetic dentist. Dentists are forbidden to claim that they are specialists in areas of practice in which there is no recognized specialty.{{clarify|date=August 2018|reason=the previous two sentences contradict each other}} They may limit their practices to a single area of dentistry, and claim that their practice is limited to that area.

Any general dentist may perform those procedures designated within the enumerated specialties if they deem themselves competent. Many general dentists train in certain aspects of the above specialties such as the placement and restoration of dental implants, advanced prosthodontics and endodontics, and have limited or heavily focused their practices to these areas. When a general dentist performs any procedure that falls within the realm of a specialty, they are expected to perform with the same level of expertise as a certified specialist and are legally held to such standards with respect to any issues of malpractice.

{{lead rewrite|date=January 2018}}
Of the 9.85 million people living in [[Sweden]], it is estimated that around 25% of them are living with a disability.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Since the late 20th century, Swedish policy toward disabilities has been centered around the idea of equal opportunity and equal rights for all. National, regional, and local governments play a part in creating an equal society, giving those with disabilities the chance to be economically and socially stable. 

Currently, Sweden has a two tier disability pension program. The first tier is a universal disability pension program that allows anyone between the ages of 16 and 64 to receive disability pay if they are unable to do half of what they could initially do. The second tier encompasses an earnings-related disability benefit that depends upon the contributions made by the workers and the level of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zeitner|first1=Ilene|title=Long-Term Disability Programs in Selected Countries|journal=Social Security Bulletin|date=September 1987|volume=50|issue=9|pages=10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Background ==

In the 19th and early 20th century, Sweden had little to no legislation protection those with disabilities and openly treated disabled people as second class citizens who didn't deserve to have equal opportunity. They would incarcerate people that were believed to be disabled, including children as young as seven years old to ensure that they wouldn't reproduce or contaminate society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Westerberg|first1=Bengt|title=A Revolution for People with Disabilities|url=https://www.independentliving.org/docs6/Westerberg-Swedish-disability-policy.html|website=Independent Living}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was their initial solution for dealing with the disabled. 

In the mid-20th century, this began to gradually change as they started to pass legislation that supported those that were disabled living outside of institutions and they began to toy with the idea of other programs that would help people with disabilities. In recent years, they have taken great strides towards guaranteeing equal rights and opportunities to those that are disabled through the implementation of government programs and legislation, regarding education, employment, housing, and transportation. 

== Government programs and legislation ==

Since the 1980s, drastic additions to government programs and legislation have closed the gap of inequality between those that are disabled and those that are full functioning members of society, giving disabled people the opportunity to have jobs, receive and education, and live in their own housing with help if necessary. In order to qualify for any sort of disability pay, a person has to be able to do 50% less than what they were initially able to do. To qualify for full disability pay, a person has to be able to do 84% less than what they were initially able to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zeitner|first1=Ilene|title=Long-Term Disability Programs in Selected Countries|journal=Social Security Bulletin|date=September 1987|volume=50|issue=9|pages=10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Social Services Act ===
The Social Services Act implemented in 1982 and since changed many times covers a wide array of people in addition to functionally disabled, including the elderly, children, crime victims, and people that have alcohol or drug addictions. It states that those who are under the age of 65 with a functional disability are able to request services such as a companion to help with errands, special housing options that would allow them to be cared for 24 hours a day, and home help services if they need assistance with personal care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Swedish Social Service Act|url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/46114/Swedish%20Social%20Services%20Act.pdf?sequence=2|website=IDEALS at Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Cash sickness benefit ===
If a worker is ill and unable to work, they will receive full pay for up to 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zeitner|first1=Ilene|title=Long-Term Disability Programs in Selected Countries|journal=Social Security Bulletin|date=September 1987|volume=50|issue=9|pages=10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Education Act ===
The Education Act guarantees that starting at the age of 6, all children will have equal access to education opportunities. It also insures that children who may need extra help in school, meaning children that have disabilities, will receive it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disability Policy|url=https://sweden.se/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Disability-policy-in-Sweden-low-res1.pdf|website=Sweden|publisher=Swedish Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Housing grants ===
These allow people to request grants in order to modify their living space to make it more accessible with their disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disability Policy|url=https://sweden.se/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Disability-policy-in-Sweden-low-res1.pdf|website=Sweden|publisher=Swedish Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Vocational rehabilitation ===
[[Vocational rehabilitation]] is automatically offered to every person with a disability, but in order to receive a referral to a rehabilitation facility, it has to be believed that you will be able to do at least half of what you could do before the disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zeitner|first1=Ilene|title=Long-Term Disability Programs in Selected Countries|journal=Social Security Bulletin|date=September 1987|volume=50|issue=9|pages=10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Car subsidies ===
People who are unable to ride public transportation or have a difficult time can request subsidies that help them purchase a car, so they are able to get around easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disability Policy|url=https://sweden.se/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Disability-policy-in-Sweden-low-res1.pdf|website=Sweden|publisher=Swedish Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Employment ==
A significant amount of research has been done on the employment of people with disabilities in Sweden and it has been found that although employers don't have a direct bias against people with disabilities, they are much more hesitant to hire them because of the future problems that they expect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Backenroth|first1=Gunnel A.M.|title=Disabilities in Working Life - A Review of Swedish Research and Some Theoretical Considerations|journal=European Psychology|date=December 1996|volume=1|issue=4|pages=283-289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there has been improvement, research has found that the number of mentally disabled adults is extremely low in the regular workforce. Those that are working with disabilities often feel that they are being left out of social outings and are given work that isn't relative to their level of skill, which causes dissatisfaction, increasing the chance that they will retire early.

=== Sheltered employment ===
One of the solutions for increasing the number of disabled people in the workforce has been [[sheltered employment]]. In Sweden, there's only one foundation that does this, called Samhall, which was established as a limited liability company in 1992 and receives government funding and subsidies to train their workers.&lt;ref name=Visier&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Visier|first1=Laurent|title=Sheltered employment for persons with disabilities|journal=International Labour Review|date=1998|volume=137|issue=3|pages=348-365|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/revue/download/pdf/visier.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most other countries, Sweden doesn't have any legislation or policies that are directed at sheltered employment policies. In Sweden, the average age of a disabled worker working in sheltered employment is 46 years old and the average time that a disabled person works there is around 8 years.&lt;ref name=Visier/&gt; 

Unlike many other countries, Sweden allows these disabled workers to sign a contract that is identical to what a general worker would sign.&lt;ref name=Visier/&gt; Another unique factor in Sweden is that almost 100% of the disabled workers working in sheltered employment jobs are members of a union, guaranteeing them collective bargaining.&lt;ref name=Visier/&gt; The main goal of sheltered employment is to offer disabled people the opportunity to work with the same rights that they would have if they weren't disabled. It also can help them get back into the regular workforce, although, this is rare depending upon their disability.

'''Drug therapy problems''' ('''DTPs''') (or '''drug related problems, DRPs''') represent the categorization and definition of clinical problems related to the use of [[medications]] or "drugs" in the field of [[pharmaceutical care]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Problems in pediatric drug therapy: By Louis A. Pagliaro and Ann M. Pagliaro | author=Chaves-Carballo, Enrique | journal=Pediatric Neurology | year=1995 | volume=13 | issue=2 | pages=181 | doi=10.1016/0887-8994(95)90028-4 | type=Book review}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of clinical practice, DTPs are often identified, prevented, and/or resolved by [[pharmacists]] in the course of [[medication therapy management]], as experts on the safety and efficacy of medications, but other [[healthcare professionals]] may also manage DTPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel|title=Psychology|year=2012|publisher=Worth Publisher|location=United States of America|isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2|pages=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A drug-therapy (related) problem can be defined as an event or circumstance involving [[drug]] [[therapy|treatment]] ([[pharmacotherapy]]) that interferes with the optimal provision of medical care. In 1990,  L.M. Strand and her colleagues (based on the previous work of R.L Mikeal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mikeal|first=R. L.|last2=Brown|first2=T. R.|last3=Lazarus|first3=H. L.|last4=Vinson|first4=M. C.|date=1975-06-01|title=Quality of pharmaceutical care in hospitals|journal=American Journal of Hospital Pharmacy|volume=32|issue=6|pages=567–574|issn=0002-9289|pmid=1155467}}&lt;/ref&gt; and D.C Brodie,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brodie|first=D. C.|last2=Parish|first2=P. A.|last3=Poston|first3=J. W.|date=1980-08-01|title=Societal needs for drugs and drug-related services|journal=American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education|volume=44|issue=3|pages=276–278|issn=0002-9459|pmid=10317016}}&lt;/ref&gt; published respectively in 1975 and 1980) classified the DTPs into eight different categories. According to these categories, pharmacists generated a list of the DTPs for each patient. As a result, pharmacists had a cleaner picture of the patient's drug therapy and medical conditions. A second publication of R.J Cipolle with L.M Strand in 1998, change the eight categories into seven, grouped in four Pharmacotherapy needs: indication, effectiveness, safety and adherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pharmaceutical Care Practice|last=Cipolle|first=Robert|publisher=Mc Graw Hill|year=1998|isbn=978-0-07-175638-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*Patients suffering from chronic pain that are prescribed [[opioid]] painkillers (such as [[morphine]]) may build up a [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]] to the effect of the painkillers, requiring higher doses to achieve the same pain reducing effect. This risky practice of dose escalation can lead to drug overdoses. 
*Some drugs reduce the body's absorption of [[essential nutrients]] from food, which could lead to [[nutritional deficiencies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=White |first1=R. |last2=Ashworth |first2=A. |year=2000 |title=How drug therapy can affect, threaten and compromise nutritional status |journal=Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics|volume=13|number=2|pages=119–129 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-277x.2000.00221.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The original eight problems==
According to page 73 in ''Introduction to Health Care Delivery: A Primer for Pharmacists'', drug therapy problems (DTP) originated from Strand et al. (1990) who defined eight problems that could result in poorer health outcomes in an attempt to categorize DTP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.theannals.com/cgi/content/abstract/24/11/1093 | title=Drug-related problems: their structure and function | journal=DICP | year=1990 | volume=24 | issue=11 | pmid=2275235 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050126031032/http://www.theannals.com/cgi/content/abstract/24/11/1093 | archivedate=January 26, 2005 | vauthors= Strand LM, Morley PC, Cipolle RJ, Ramsey R, Lamsam GD |deadurl=y | pages=1093–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helper and Strand later in 1990 stated the mission statement or raison d'etre of [[pharmacist]]s should be to correct these drug therapy problems.

The original eight problems have now been condensed into '''seven categories of problems'''. As given by Shargel, they are:

# Unnecessary drug therapy. This could occur when the patient has been placed on too many medications for their condition and the drug is simply not needed.
# Wrong drug. This could occur when a patient is given medication that does not treat the patient's condition. Ex. A heart medication to treat an infection.
# Dose too low. This could occur when a patient is given medication that is not strong enough to get beneficial or therapeutic effects.
# Dose too high. This could occur when a patient is given medication that is too strong and is causing detrimental effects or is simply not necessary.
# Adverse drug reaction. This could occur when a patient has an allergic response to a medication.
# Inappropriate adherence. This could occur when a patient chooses not to or forgets to take a medication.
# Needs additional drug therapy. This could occur when a patient needs more medication to treat their condition.

==Further breakdown of categories==
DRPs can be broken down further into the following categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shargel, Leon|title=Comprehensive Pharmacy Review|edition=7th|p=563}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Pharmaceutical Care Practice: The Clinician's Guide'', 2e chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Pharmacotherapy Casebook: A Patient-Focused Approach'', 7e Chapter "Identification of Drug Therapy Problems"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://aop.sagepub.com/content/30/2/119|title=Identification and Clarification of Drug Therapy Problems by Indian Health Service Pharmacists|first1=Cynthia P.|last1=Smith|first2=Dale B.|last2=Christensen|date=1 February 1996|publisher=|journal=Ann Pharmacother|volume=30|issue=2|pages=119–124|via=aop.sagepub.com|doi=10.1177/106002809603000201|pmid=8835041}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12952316 | volume=43 | issue=4 | title=Drug therapy management: an empirical report of drug therapy problems, pharmacists' interventions, and results of pharmacists' actions | year=2003 | journal=J Am Pharm Assoc (2003) | pages=511–8 | doi=10.1331/154434503322226266 | author=McDonough RP, Doucette WR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashp.org/s_ashp/docs/files/advocacy/policy_alert/MN_MTM_1_14_08.pdf|title=Minnesota Pharmacist-led MTM Program Resolves Nearly 800 Drug Therapy Problems in First Year|first=|last=ASHP|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228234356/http://www.ashp.org/s_ashp/docs/files/advocacy/policy_alert/MN_MTM_1_14_08.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-28|date=January 14, 2008|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eprints.usm.my/9696/1/DRUG_THERAPY_PROBLEMS_AND_QUALITY_OF_LIFE_IN_PATIENTS_WITH_CHRONIC_KIDNEY_DISEASE.pdf | title=Drug therapy problems and quality of life in patients with chronic kidney disease | publisher=Universiti Sains Malaysia | date=2008 | accessdate=August 12, 2016 | author=Mansour Adam Mahmoud}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from: Cipolle RJ, Strand LM, Morley PC.

==Accessory salivary glands==
An ''accessory salivary gland'' is ectopic salivary gland tissue with a salivary gland duct system.&lt;ref name=Witt2011&gt;{{cite book|author=Witt RL|title=Salivary Gland Diseases: Surgical and Medical Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DzeFVDYopvIC&amp;pg=PA53|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Thieme|isbn=978-1-60406-537-4|pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common location of accessory salivary gland tissue is an extra major salivary gland in front of the [[parotid gland]]. It is typically about 3&amp;nbsp;cm or less in size, and drains into the parotid duct via a single tributary.&lt;ref name=Witt2011 /&gt; Accessory parotid tissue is found in 21-56% of adults.&lt;ref name=Witt2011 /&gt; Any disease process which affects the salivary glands, including cancer,  may also occur within an accessory salivary gland tissue.

==Heterotopic salivary gland tissue==
''Salivary gland heterotopia'' is where salivary gland [[acini]] cells are present in an abnormal location without any duct system.&lt;ref name=Witt2011 /&gt;  The most common location is the cervical [[lymph node]]s. Other reported sites of heterotopic salivary gland tissue are the [[middle ear]], [[parathyroid gland]]s, [[thyroid gland]], [[pituitary gland]], [[cerebellar pontine angle]], soft tissue medial to [[sternocleidomastoid]], [[stomach]], [[rectum]] and [[vulva]].&lt;ref name=Witt2011 /&gt; [[Salivary gland neoplasm]] occurrence within heterotopic salivary gland tissue is rare.&lt;ref name=Witt2011 /&gt;

'''Egg donation''' is the process by which a woman donates [[ovum|eggs]] to enable another woman to conceive as part of an assisted reproduction treatment or for biomedical research. For assisted reproduction purposes, egg donation typically involves [[in vitro fertilization]] technology, with the eggs being fertilized in the laboratory; more rarely, unfertilized eggs may be frozen and stored for later use. Egg donation is a [[third party reproduction]] as part of [[assisted reproductive technology]].

In the United States, the [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine]] has issued guidelines for these procedures, and the Food and Drug Administration has a number of guidelines as well. There are boards in countries outside of the US which have the same regulations. However, egg donation agencies in the U.S. can choose whether to abide by the society's regulations or not.

==History==
The first child born from egg donation was reported in Australia in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monashivf.com/treatment/qld/treatments-available/egg-donation/|title=Egg Donation|work=Monash IVF|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1983, a clinic in Southern California reported a pregnancy using egg donation, which led to the birth of the first American child born from egg donation on February 3, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9404EEDC143BF937A35751C0A962948260|title=Infertile Woman Has Baby Through Embryo Transfer|first=Sandra|last=Blakeslee|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=1984-02-04|accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure was performed at the Harbor UCLA Medical Center and the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humc.edu/calendar/careacc.html|title=HUMC - Celebrating 50 Years of Caring|publisher=Humc.edu|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the procedure, which is no longer used today, a fertilized egg that was just beginning to develop was transferred from one woman in whom it had been conceived by artificial insemination to another woman who gave birth to the infant 38 weeks later. The sperm used in the artificial insemination came from the husband of the woman who bore the baby.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952517,00.html | work=Time |title=Medicine: A Legal, Moral, Social Nightmare |date=1984-09-10 |accessdate=2010-05-01 |first1=Otto |last1=Friedrich |first2=Anne |last2=Constable |first3=Raji |last3=Samghabadi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="neworigins"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952514,00.html |title=The New Origins of Life |magazine=[[TIME]] |first=Claudia |last=Wallis |date=1984-09-10 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to this, thousands of infertile women, single men and gay male couples had adoption as the only path to parenthood. Advances in IVF and egg donation set the stage to allow open and candid discussion of oocyte and embryo donation as a common practice.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="neworigins"/&gt; This breakthrough has given way to the donation of human oocytes and embryos as a common practice similar to other donations such as blood and major organ donations. At the time of this announcement the event was captured by major news carriers and fueled healthy debate and discussion on this practice which affected the future of reproductive medicine by creating a platform for further advancements in woman's health.

This scientific breakthrough changed the outlook for those who were unable to have children due to female infertility and for women who are at high risk for passing on genetic disorders. As IVF developed, the procedures used in egg donation paralleled that development: the egg donor's eggs are now harvested from her ovaries in an outpatient surgical procedure and fertilized in the laboratory, the same procedure used on IVF patients, but the resulting embryo or embryos is then transferred into the intended mother instead of into the woman who provided the egg. Donor oocytes thus give women a mechanism to become pregnant and give birth to a child that will be their biological child (assuming that the recipient woman carries the baby), but not their genetic child. In cases where the recipient's womb is absent or unable to carry a pregnancy, or in cases involving gay male couples, a gestational surrogate is used and the embryos are implanted into her per an agreement with the recipients. The combination of egg donation and surrogacy has enabled gay men, including singer Elton John and his partner, to have biological children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/8235149/Elton-John-baby-Thanks-to-Zacahary-gay-surrogacy-will-become-more-acceptable.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Olga | last=Craig | title=Elton John baby: "Thanks to Zacahary, gay surrogacy will become more acceptable" | date=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oocyte and embryo donation now account for approximately 18% of in vitro fertilization recorded births in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sartcorsonline.com/rptCSR_PublicMultYear.aspx?ClinicPKID=0|title=Clinic Summary Report|publisher=Sartcorsonline.com|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ideas.time.com/2013/08/24/get-used-to-embryo-adoption |title=Get Used to Embryo Adoption[|magazine=TIME |first=Sarah Elizabeth |last=Richards |date=2013-08-24 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work established the technical foundation and legal-ethical framework surrounding the clinical use of human oocyte and embryo donation, a mainstream clinical practice, which has evolved over the past 25 years.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952517-6,00.html | work=Time | title=Medicine: A Legal, Moral, Social Nightmare | date=1984-09-10 | accessdate=2010-05-01 | first1=Otto | last1=Friedrich | first2=Anne | last2=Constable | first3=Raji | last3=Samghabadi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building upon this groundbreaking research and since the initial birth announcement in 1984, well over 47,000 live births resulting from donor oocyte embryo transfer have been and continue to be recorded by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090220015146/http://www.obgmanagement.com/srm/pdf/first_live_birth_donation.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071008194941/http://www.obgmanagement.com/srm.asp?id=5030] &lt;/ref&gt; in the United States to infertile women, who otherwise would not have had children by any other existing method.

The legal status and cost/compensation models of egg donation vary significantly by country. It may be totally illegal (e.g., Italy, Germany, Austria);&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/04/13/fertility-treatment-bans-in-europe-draw-criticism/ | work=Fox News | title=Fertility treatment bans in Europe draw criticism | date=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dw.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/germanys-egg-donation-prohibition-is-outdated-experts-say/a-2999675-1|title=Germany′s Egg Donation Prohibition Is Outdated, Experts Say - Germany - DW.DE - 12.12.2007|work=DW.DE|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; legal only if anonymous and gratuitous—that is, without any compensation for the egg donor (e.g., France);&lt;ref name="dondovocytes.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dondovocytes.fr/comment-faire/ce-que-dit-la-loi/|title=Ce que dit la loi - Don d'ovocytes|publisher=Dondovocytes.fr|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; legal only if ''non''-anonymous and gratuitous (e.g., Canada); legal only if anonymous, but egg donors may be compensated (the compensation is often described as being to offset her inconvenience and expenses) (e.g., Spain, Czech Republic, South Africa, Greece); legal only if ''non''-anonymous, but egg donors may be compensated (e.g., the UK);&lt;ref name="ngdt.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngdt.co.uk/donation-and-the-law|title=Donation and the Law|publisher=Ngdt.co.uk|accessdate=5 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105151107/http://www.ngdt.co.uk/donation-and-the-law|archivedate=5 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or legal whether or not it is anonymous, and egg donors may be compensated (e.g., the US).

==Indication==
A need for egg donation may arise for a number of reasons. Infertile couples may resort to egg donation when the female partner cannot have genetic children because her own eggs cannot generate a viable pregnancy, or because they could generate a viable pregnancy but the chances are so low that it is not advisable or not financially feasible to do IVF with her own eggs. This situation is often, but not always based on advanced reproductive age. It can also be due to early onset of menopause, which can occur as early as their 20s. In addition, some women are born without ovaries, while some women's reproductive organs have been damaged or surgically removed due to disease or other circumstances. Another indication would be a genetic disorder on part of the woman that either renders her infertile or would be dangerous for any offspring, problems that can be circumvented by using eggs from another woman. Many women have none of these issues, but continue to be unsuccessful using their own eggs—in other words, they have undiagnosed infertility—and thus turn to donor eggs or donor embryos. As stated above, egg donation is also helpful for gay male couples using [[surrogacy]] (see [[LGBT parenting]]).

In the US and UK, if desired (and if the egg donor agrees), the couple can meet and get acquainted with the egg donor, her children and family members. More often, egg donations are anonymous or semi-anonymous (i.e. the egg donor may provide personal and medical information, photographs of herself and/or family members, and an email or third party willing to convey communications between the donor and recipients). In some countries, the law requires non-anonymity (e.g., the UK). In other countries, the law requires anonymity (e.g., France, Spain, the Czech Republic, South Africa). In the US the choice between anonymity, semi-anonymity and non-anonymity is made by the donor and recipient, although some IVF clinics that maintain their own databases of egg donors strongly encourage or require anonymity.

==Types of donors==
Donors includes the following types:
*Donors unrelated to the recipients who do it for altruistic and/or monetary reasons. In the US they are ''anonymous donors'' or ''semi-anonymous donors'' recruited by ''egg donor agencies'' or IVF clinics. Such donors may also be ''non-anonymous donors'', i.e., they may exchange identifying and contact information with the recipients. In most countries other than the US and UK, the law requires such donors to remain anonymous.
*'''Designated donors''', e.g. a friend or relative brought by the patients to serve as a donor specifically to help them. In Sweden and France, couples who can bring such a donor still get another person as a donor, but instead get advanced on the waiting list for the procedure, and that donor rather becomes a "cross donor".&lt;ref&gt;''cross donor'' is termed ''korsdonator'' in Swedish.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the couple brings a designated donor, she donates anonymously to another couple, and the couple that brought her receives eggs from another anonymous donor much more quickly than they would have if they had not been able to provide a designated donor.
*Patients taking part in '''shared oocyte programmes'''. Women who go through [[in vitro fertilization]] may be willing to donate unused eggs to such a program, where the egg recipients together help paying the cost of the In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Check | first1 = JH | title = The shared donor oocyte program: the advantages and insights it provides in determining etiologic factors of infertility | url = http://www.ccivf.com/pdf_files/pdf%20articles/CATEGO~6/003.PDF | journal = Clinical and experimental obstetrics &amp; gynecology | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 229–34 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12635736 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708125320/http://www.ccivf.com/pdf_files/pdf%20articles/CATEGO~6/003.PDF | archivedate = 2011-07-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is very cost-effective compared to other alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.nhs.uk/womenshealth/ViewResource.aspx?resID=245239 Cost analysis of shared oocyte in vitro fertilization]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Peskin B D, Austin C, Lisbona H, Goldfarb J M.

==Procedure==
{{Expert needed|Medicine|date=November 2008}}
Egg donors are first recruited, screened, and give consent before participating in the IVF process. Once the egg donor is recruited, she undergoes [[IVF]] stimulation therapy, followed by the egg retrieval procedure. After retrieval, the ova are fertilized by the sperm of the male partner (or sperm donor) in the laboratory, and, after several days, the best resulting embryo(s) is/are placed in the uterus of the recipient, whose [[uterine lining]] has been appropriately prepared for [[embryo transfer]] beforehand. The recipient is usually, but [[surrogacy|not always]], the person who requested the service and then will carry and deliver the [[pregnancy]] and keep the baby.

===The egg donor's process in detail===
Before any intensive medical, psychological, or genetic testing is done on a donor, they must first be chosen by a recipient from the profiles on agency or clinic databases (or, in countries where donors are required to remain anonymous, they are chosen by the recipient's doctor based on their physical and temperamental resemblance to the recipient woman). This is due to the fact that all of the mentioned examinations are expensive and the agencies must first confirm that a match is possible or guaranteed before investing in the process.&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"&gt;Almeling, Rene. American Sociological Review. Vol. 72, No. 3 (Jun 2007), pp. 319-340.&lt;/ref&gt; Each egg donor is first referred to a psychologist who will evaluate if she is mentally prepared to undertake and complete the donation process. These evaluations are necessary to ensure that the donor is fully prepared and capable of completing the donation cycle safely and successfully. The donor is then required to undergo a thorough medical examination, including a pelvic exam, blood draw to check hormone levels and to test for infectious diseases, Rh factor, blood type, and drugs and an ultrasound to examine her ovaries, uterus and other pelvic organs. A family history of approximately the past three generations is also required, meaning that adoptees are usually not accepted because of the lack of past health knowledge.&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"/&gt; Genetic testing is also usually done on donors to ensure that they do not carry mutations (e.g., cystic fibrosis) that could harm the resulting children; however, not all clinics automatically perform such testing and thus recipients must clarify with their clinics whether such testing will be done.

Once the screening is complete and a legal contract signed, the donor will begin the donation cycle, which typically takes between three and six weeks. An egg retrieval procedure comprises both the '''Egg Donor's Cycle''' and the '''Recipient's Cycle'''. Birth control pills are administered during the first few weeks of the egg donation process to synchronize the donor's cycle with the recipient's, followed by a series of injections which halt the normal functioning of the donor's ovaries. These injections may be self-administered on a daily basis for a period of one to three weeks. Next, [[follicle-stimulating hormone]]s (FSH) are given to the donor to stimulate egg production and increases the number of mature eggs produced by the ovaries. Throughout the cycle the donor is monitored often by a physician using blood tests and ultrasound exams to determine the donor's reaction to the hormones and the progress of [[ovarian follicle|follicle]] growth.

Once the doctor decides the follicles are mature, he/she will establish the date and time for the egg retrieval procedure. Approximately 36 hours before retrieval, the donor must administer one last injection of [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|HCG]] hormone to ensure that her eggs are ready to be harvested. The egg retrieval itself is a minimally invasive surgical procedure lasting 20–30 minutes, performed under sedation (but sometimes without any). A small ultrasound-guided needle is inserted through the vagina to [[:wikt:aspirate|aspirate]] the follicles in both ovaries, which extracts the eggs. After resting in a recovery room for an hour or two, the donor is released. Most donors resume regular activities by the next day.

==Results==
In the United States, egg donor cycles have a success rate of over 60%. (See statistics at http://www.sart.org.) When a "fresh cycle" is followed by a "frozen cycle", the success rate with donor eggs is approximately 80%.

With egg donation, women who are past their reproductive years or [[menopause]] can still become pregnant. [[Adriana Iliescu]] held the record as the oldest woman to give birth using IVF and donated egg, when she gave birth in 2004 at the age of 66, a record passed in 2006.

==Recipient and donor motivation==

===Intended parent motivation===
Women may resort to egg donation because their ovaries may not be able to produce a substantial number of viable eggs. Women may experience premature ovarian failure and stop producing viable eggs during their reproductive years. Some women may be born without ovaries. Ovaries damaged by chemotherapy or radiotherapy may also no longer produce healthy eggs. Older women with diminished ovarian reserves or older women who are going through menopause could also become pregnant with egg donation.&lt;ref name="Sophia tsi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dunyaivf.blogspot.gr/2014/11/why-people-choose-to-proceed-with-egg.html|title=Why people choose to proceed with egg donation? - Egg Donation|publisher=dunyaivf.co.uk|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who produce healthy eggs may also elect to use a donor egg so they will not pass on genetic diseases.

===Donor motivation===
An egg donor may be motivated to donate eggs for altruistic reasons. A survey of 80 American women showed that 30% were motivated by altruism alone, another 20% were attracted only by monetary compensation, while 40% of donors were motivated by both reasons. The same study found that 45% of egg donors were students the first time they donated and averaged $4,000 for each donation.&lt;ref name="Kara N. Maxwell 2008"&gt;Kara N. Maxwell, Ina N. Cholst, Zev Rosenwaks. (2008). The incidence of both serious and minor complications in young women undergoing oocyte donation, Fertility and Sterility. 90: 2165-2171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the donors may be motivated by both monetary and altruistic reasons, egg agencies desire and prefer to choose donors that are strictly providing eggs for altruistic reasons.&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"/&gt; The European Union limits any financial compensation for donors to at most $1500. In some countries, most notably Spain and Cyprus, this has limited donors to the poorest segments of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/blog/untold-stories/it%E2%80%99s-not-altruism-it%E2%80%99s-selling|title=The Cyprus Scramble: An Investigation into Human Egg Markets - Pulitzer Center|publisher=Pulitzercenter.org|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, donors are paid regardless of how many eggs she produces. A donor’s compensation may increase for each additional time she provides eggs, especially if the donor’s eggs have a history of reliably resulting in the recipient becoming pregnant.&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"/&gt; In the United States, egg-broker agencies are known for advertising to college students who are more likely to be in financial situations that motivate them to participate for the financial compensation. It is not unusual for one student to donate many times. Often, this is done without consideration of potential long-term health consequences. Such a student is arguably not making the decision to donate her eggs autonomously due to her unfavorable financial situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbmojournal.com/article/S1472-6483%2810%2960647-5/abstract|title=DEFINE_ME_WA|publisher=rbmojournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==

===Egg donor===
The procedures for the donor and the medication given to her are identical to the procedures and medications used in autologous IVF (i.e., IVF on patients who are using their own eggs). The egg donor thus has the same low risk of complications from IVF as an autologous IVF patient would, such as bleeding from the oocyte recovery procedure and reaction to the hormones used to induce hyperovulation (producing more than one egg), including [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]] (OHSS) and, rarely, liver failure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Textbook of Assisted Reproductive Techniques, Laboratory and Clinical Perspectives, edited by David K. Gardner, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jansen and Tucker, writing in the same assisted reproductive technologies textbook referenced above,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; the risk of OHSS varies with the clinic administering the hormones, from 6.6 to 8.4% of cycles, half of them "severe." The most severe form of OHSS is life-threatening. Recent studies have found that donors were at less risk of OHSS when the final maturation of oocytes was induced by GnRH agonist than with recombinant hCG. Both hormones were comparable in the number of mature oocytes produced and fertilization rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/09513590802404013 | last1 = Galindo | first1 = A. | last2 = Bodri | first2 = D. | last3 = Guillen | first3 = J.J. | last4 = Colodron | first4 = M. | last5 = Vernaeve | first5 = V. | last6 = Coll | first6 = O. | year = 2009 | title = Triggering with HCG or GnRH agonist in GnRH antagonist treated oocyte donation cycles: a randomized clinical trial | url = | journal = Gynecol Endocrinol | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 60–6 | pmid = 19165664 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.11.049 | last1 = Bodri | first1 = D. | last2 = Guillen | first2 = J.J. | last3 = Galindo | first3 = A. | last4 = Mataro | first4 = D. | last5 = Pujol | first5 = A. | last6 = Coll | first6 = O. | year = 2009 | title = Triggering with human chorionic gonadotropin or a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist-treated oocyte donor cycles:findings of large retrospective cohort study | url = | journal = Fertil Steril | volume = 91 | issue = 2| pages = 365–71 | pmid = 18367175 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A larger study in the Netherlands found 10 documented cases of deaths from IVF, with a rate of 1:10,000. "All of these patients were treated with GnRH agonists and none of these cases have been published in the scientific literature."

The long-term effect of egg donation on donors has not been well studied, but because the same medications and procedures are used, it should be essentially the same as the long-term effect (if any) of IVF on patients using their own eggs. The evidence of increased cancer risk is equivocal; some studies have pointed to a slightly increased risk while other studies have found no such risk or even a slightly reduced risk in most patients (women with a family history of breast cancer, however, may have a higher risk).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/healthday/2008/12/26/risks-and-benefits-of-egg-donation-reported.html?PageNr=1|title=Risks and Benefits of Egg Donation Reported|work=US News &amp; World Report|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=In vitro fertilization and breast cancer risk: a review|first=M|last=Salhab|newspaper=International journal of fertility and women's medicine|date=November 2005|pmid=16526416|volume=50|issue=6|pages=259–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1 in 5 women report psychological effects—which may be positive or negative—from donating their eggs, and two-thirds of egg donors were happy with the decision to donate their eggs. The same study found that 20% of women did not recall being aware of any physical risks.&lt;ref name="Kara N. Maxwell 2008"/&gt; In accordance with the American Society for Reproductive Medicine guidelines, female donors are given a limit of 6 cycles that they may donate in order to minimize the possible health risks.&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"/&gt;

However, it appears that repetitive oocyte donation cycles does not cause accelerated ovarian aging, evidenced by absence of decreased [[anti-Müllerian hormone]] (AMH) in such women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bukulmez O |author2=Li Q |author3=Carr BR |author4=Leader B |author5=Doody KM |author6=Doody KJ |title=Repetitive oocyte donation does not decrease serum anti-Müllerian hormone levels |journal=Fertil.

===Intended parent===
The recipient has a minimal risk of contracting a transmittable disease. While the donor may test negative for HIV, such testing does not exclude the possibility that the donor has contracted [[HIV]] very recently, so the recipient faces a residual risk of exposure. However, the FDA governs this and requires full infectious disease testing no more than 30 days prior to retrieval and/or transfer. Most clinics now require, however, that donors be retested a few days prior to retrieval so the risk to the recipient is minimal. Intimate partners of both the egg donor and the recipient are also tested.

The recipient also trusts that the medical history of the donor and her family is accurate. This factor of trust should not be underestimated in importance. Donors in the US are paid thousands of dollars; such compensation may attract unscrupulous individuals inclined to conceal their true motivations. However, a full psychological evaluation is required by most IVF clinics, giving an indication if the donor is trustworthy or not.

In more cases than not, there is no ongoing relationship between the donor and recipient following the cycle. Both the donor and recipient agree in formal legal documents that the donation of the eggs is final at the time of retrieval, and typically both parties would like any "relationship" to conclude at that point; if they prefer continued contact, they may provide for that in the contract. Even if they prefer anonymity, however, it remains theoretically possible that in the future, some children may be able to identify their donor(s) using DNA databanks and/or registries (e.g., if the donor submits her DNA to a genealogy site and a child born from her donation later submits its DNA to the same site).

[[Multiple birth]] is a common complication. Incidence of twin births is very high. At the present time, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommends that no more than 1 or 2 embryos be transferred in any given cycle. Remaining embryos are frozen, whether for future transfers if the first one fails, for siblings, or for eventual embryo donation.

There appears to be a slightly higher risk of [[pregnancy-induced hypertension]] in pregnancies of egg donation.&lt;ref name="van-der-Hoorn2010"/&gt;

Pregnancies with egg donation are associated with a slightly increased risk of [[placental pathology]].&lt;ref name="van-der-Hoorn2010"/&gt; The local and systemic immunologic changes are also more pronounced than in natural pregnancies, so it has been suggested that the association is caused by reduced [[maternal immune tolerance]] towards the fetus, as the genetic similarity between the carrier and fetus from an egg donation is less than in a natural pregnancy.&lt;ref name="van-der-Hoorn2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq017| last1 = Van Der Hoorn | first1 = M. L. P. | last2 = Lashley | first2 = E. E. L. O. | last3 = Bianchi | first3 = D. W. | last4 = Claas | first4 = F. H. J. | last5 = Schonkeren | first5 = C. M. C. | last6 = Scherjon | first6 = S.

===Custody===
Generally legal documents are signed renouncing rights and responsibilities of custody on the part of the donor. Most IVF doctors will not proceed with administering medication to any donor until these documents are in place and a legal "clearance letter" confirming this understanding is provided to the doctor.

==Legality and financial issues==
The legal status and cost/compensation models of egg donation vary significantly by country. It may be totally illegal (e.g., Italy, Germany);&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dw.de"/&gt; legal only if anonymous and gratuitous—that is, without any compensation for the egg donor (e.g., France);&lt;ref name="dondovocytes.fr"/&gt; legal only if ''non''-anonymous and gratuitous (e.g., Canada); legal only if anonymous, but egg donors may be compensated (the compensation is often described as being to offset her inconvenience and expenses) (e.g., Spain, Czech Republic, South Africa); legal only if ''non''-anonymous, but egg donors may be compensated (e.g., the UK);&lt;ref name="ngdt.co.uk"/&gt; or legal whether or not it is anonymous, and egg donors may be compensated (e.g., the US). Because most countries prohibit the sale of body parts, egg donors generally are paid for undergoing the necessary medical procedures rather than for their eggs. In other words, if they complete the cycle, they will be paid the agreed price regardless of how many (or how few) eggs are retrieved.

In countries that prohibit compensation there is an extreme dearth of young women willing to go through this procedure. Additionally, in most countries where it is legal and compensated, the law places a cap on the compensation and that cap tends to be in the vicinity of $1000–$2000. In the US, no law caps the compensation, but the American Society for Reproductive Medicine requires member clinics to abide by their standards, which provide that "sums of $5,000 or more require justification and sums above $10,000 are not appropriate."&lt;ref name="asrm.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/News_and_Publications/Ethics_Committee_Reports_and_Statements/financial_incentives.pdf|format=PDF|title=Financial compensation of oocyte donors|publisher=Asrm.org|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "justification" for payments over $5000 may include previous successful donations, unusually good family health history, or membership in minority ethnicities for which it is more difficult to find donors.

As a result of these legal and financial differences around the world, egg donation in the US is much more expensive than it is in other countries. For instance, at one top US clinic it costs more than $26,000 plus the donor's medications (another several thousand dollars).&lt;ref name="sdfertility.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdfertility.com/secure_fees.htm|title=San Diego IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) Guarantee|publisher=Sdfertility.com|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having an attorney draft a contract is recommended in order to ensure that the donor has no possible legal rights or responsibilities over the child or any frozen embryos. Hiring an attorney who specializes in reproductive law is thus strongly recommended, at least in the United States; other countries may have other procedures for clarifying the parties' rights, or may simply have legislation that defines the parties' rights. In the US, before the egg donor's IVF cycle begins she typically must sign the Egg Donor Contract, which specifies the rights of the donor and the recipient(s) with respect to the retrieved eggs, the embryos, and any children conceived from the donation. Such contracts should specify that the recipients are the legal parents of the child and the legal owners of any eggs or embryos resulting from the cycle; in other words, while the donor has the right to cancel the cycle at any time prior to egg donation (although if she does so the contract generally provides that she will not be paid), once the eggs are retrieved they belong to the recipient(s). In individual cases the donors and parents may also wish to negotiate terms relating to any unused embryos (e.g., some donors would prefer that unused embryos be destroyed or donated to science, while others would prefer or allow them to be donated to another infertile couple). Some states have also adopted the [[Uniform Parentage Act]], which provides that the recipient or recipients have complete parental responsibility of the conceived child.

In ''Buzzanca v. Buzzanca'', 72 Cal. Rptr.2d 280 (Cal. Ct. App. 1998), the court held that both the recipient and the father of a child conceived through anonymous sperm and egg donation and carried by a surrogate were the legal parents of the child by virtue of their procreative intent. Therefore, the father was required to pay child support even though he sought a divorce before the child was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.uh.edu/healthlaw/perspectives/Reproductive/980408Child.html|title=California Appellate Court Holds Divorcing Spouses Who Were Intended Parents of Child Resulting from Anonymous Egg and Sperm Donors and Brought to Term by Surrogate to Be Legal Parents of Child|publisher=Law.uh.edu|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Donor registries==
{{Main article|Donor registration}}
A donor registry is a registry to facilitate [[donor conceived people]], sperm donors and [[egg donor]]s to establish contact with genetic kindred. They are mostly used by donor conceived people to find genetic half-siblings from the same egg- or sperm donor.

Some donors are non-anonymous, but most are anonymous, i.e. the donor conceived person doesn't know the true identity of the donor. Still, he/she may get the donor number from the fertility clinic. If that donor had donated before, then other donor conceived people with the same donor number are thus genetic half-siblings. In short, donor registries match people who type in the same donor number.

Alternatively, if the donor number isn't available, then known donor characteristics, e.g. hair, eye and skin color may be used in matching.

Donors may also register, and therefore, donor registries may also match donors with their genetic children.

The largest registry is the Donor Sibling Registry- with more than 25,000 members, the DSR has matched almost 7,000 donor conceived people with their egg and sperm donors, as well as with their half siblings. Alternate methods of providing an information link between the donor and recipient (both agreeing to stay registered on the DSR) are often provided for in the legal document (referred to as the "Egg Donor Agreement".)

==Embryo donation==
An alternative to egg donation in some couples, especially those in whom the male partner cannot provide viable sperm, is [[embryo donation]]. Embryo donation is the use of embryos remaining after a couple’s IVF treatments have been completed, to another individual or couple, followed by the placement of those embryos into the recipient woman’s uterus, to facilitate pregnancy and childbirth. Embryo donation is more cost-effective than egg donation on a "per live birth" basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Finger R, Sommerfelt C, Freeman M, Wilson CK, Wade A, Daly D | year = 2010 | title = A cost-effectiveness comparison of embryo donation with oocyte donation | url = | journal = Fertil Steril | volume = 93 | issue = | pages = 379–81 | doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.03.019 | pmid=19406398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study has found that embryos created for one couple, using an egg donor, are often made available for donation to another couple if the first couple chooses not to use them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hill GA, Freeman MR | year = 2011 | title = Embryo disposition: Choices made by patients and donor oocyte recipients | url = | journal = Fertil Steril | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 940–3 | doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological and social issues==
{{Further information|Donor conceived people#Psychological and social}}

&lt;big&gt;'''Quality of Parent-Infant Relationships'''&lt;/big&gt; 

Quality of parent-child attachment in early infancy has been recognized as a crucial influencer of a child’s socioemotional development. The formation of a quality and secure attachment is largely influenced by parental representations of the parent-child relationship (Imrie, Jadva, Golombok, &amp; Fishel, 2018). Concern regarding relationship quality and attachment security in egg donor families is understandable and typically stems from the absence of genetic material shared between the mother and child. In recent years, researchers have begun to question if lack of genetic commonality between mother and child inhibits the ability to form a quality attachment. 

In a recent study, quality of infant-parent relationships was examined among egg donor families in comparison to in vitro fertilization families (Imrie et al., 2018). Infants were between the ages of 6-18 months. Through use of the Parent Development Interview (PDI) and observational assessment, the study found few differences between family types on the representational level, yet significant differences between family types on the observational level (Imrie et al., 2018). Egg donation mothers were less sensitive and structuring than IVF mothers, and egg donation infants were less emotionally responsive, and involving than IVF infants (Imrie et al., 2018). No differences were found in relationship quality between egg donor fathers and IVF fathers representationally or observationally. Due to the developmental implications of forming healthy parent-child relationships in early infancy, the finding that egg donor mothers were less sensitive and structuring towards their infants raises concern about attachment styles among egg donor families, and the impacts it may have on infants’ future socioemotional development. 


===Telling the child===
Most psychologists recommend being open and honest with children from an early age. Groups for donor conceived children make a strong case for the rights of children to have access to information about their genetic background. For donor conceived children who find out after a long period of secrecy, their main grief is usually not the fact that they are not the genetic child of the mother who raised (and, usually, gave birth to) them, but the fact that their parents lied to them, causing loss of trust.&lt;ref name=barratt/&gt; Furthermore, assuming that egg-donor conceived children have essentially the same reaction as sperm-donor conceived children, the overturning of one's lifelong understanding of who one's genetic parents were may cause a lasting sense of imbalance and loss of control.

Telling the children that they were donor conceived is recommended, based on decades of experience with adoption (and more recent feedback from donor-conceived children) showing that not telling children is harmful to the parent-child relationship and to the child psychologically.&lt;ref name="aboutourkids.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutourkids.org/articles/where_did_i_come_answering_kids039_questions_about_donor_eggs_or_sperm|title=Where did I come from?

*When anyone other than the parents know about the donation, such that the child might find it out from somebody else.&lt;ref name=barratt&gt;Donor insemination Edited by C.L.R. Barratt and I.D. Cooke. Cambridge (England): Cambridge University Press, 1993. 231 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;
*When the recipient carries a significant genetic disease, since telling the child will reassure the child that he or she does not carry the disease.&lt;ref name=barratt/&gt;
*Where the child is found to suffer from a genetically-transmitted disorder and it is necessary to take legal action which then identifies the donor.

Conversely, when the child is being raised in a religion or a culture that strongly disapproves of donor conception (e.g., a Catholic country where egg donation is illegal), that may counsel against telling the child, at least until the child is much older and clearly capable of understanding why he or she was not told earlier and of keeping that information to him or herself.

A systematic review of factors contributing to parental decision-making in disclosing donor conception has shown that parents cite the child’s best interest as the main factor they use to make the decision &lt;ref&gt;A. Indekeu, K. Dierickx, P. Schotsmans, K.R. Daniels, P. Rober, and T. D'Hooghe
Factors contributing to parental decision-making in disclosing donor conception: a systematic review.&lt;/ref&gt; Parents who disclose donor conception to the child emphasize the importance of an honest parent-child relationship, while parents who do not disclose express their desire to protect the child from social stigma or other trauma. Health care staff and support groups have been demonstrated to affect the decision to disclose the procedure.&lt;ref name=Indekeu2013&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Indekeu | first1 = A. | last2 = Dierickx | first2 = K. | last3 = Schotsmans | first3 = P. | last4 = Daniels | first4 = K.

===Families sharing same donor===
Having contact and meeting among families sharing the same donor generally has positive effects.&lt;ref name=scheibJuly&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scheib JE, Ruby A |title=Contact among families who share the same sperm donor |journal=Fertil.

===Other family members===
Parents of donors may regard the donated eggs as a family asset and may regard the donor conceived people as grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/family-and-relationships/my-scattered-grandchildren/article1286201/|title=My scattered grandchildren|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Donor marketing==
For a donor to be accepted by an agency and repeatedly used she must be marketable and appealing to the recipients. Although egg donation is a significant, life-giving act, the companies participating in this industry still have to operate with an economical mind-set. Matches between egg recipients and egg donors are what make the profit for the company and achievable to continue these processes for others. The most sought-after donors tend to be those who are (1) proven (i.e., have donated before and produced a pregnancy from it, proving themselves both fertile and reliable); (2) conventionally attractive; (3) healthy, with good family health histories; and (4) smart, well educated. 
 
Donor profiles presented on agency websites are their primary marketing tool to find recipients and learn what these future consumers want. On the donor profiles listed on the agency website for recipients, or "clients", to peruse for their desired egg match, "physical characteristics, family health history, educational attainment (in some cases, standardized test scores, GPA, and IQ scores are requested), as well as open-ended questions about hobbies, likes and dislikes, and motivations for donating"&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"/&gt; are included. Donors are encouraged to submit attractive photos and are advised of what the recipient finds as desirable. Profiles that are at some point deemed unacceptable are deleted, whether it be because their personalities did not stand out or their portrayals were viewed as negative in some way. Overweight volunteers for donation are also most often not accepted, not just because of conventional views on physical attractiveness but also because women with a higher body-mass index tend to respond differently (less well) to ovarian stimulation drugs and IVF clinics thus generally recommend that patients not use donors with higher BMIs. Egg donors also have a higher standard of physical appearance than sperm donors; many sperm donors are not required to provide adult photographs of themselves, or in some cases, any photographs.&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"/&gt;

== Religious views ==
Some Christian leaders indicate that IVF is acceptable (provided that no fertilized embryos are discarded in the process). Many Christian couples who cannot have children thus can go for IVF, with both the husband's sperm and the wife's egg and this is in line with the church's teaching.

However the issue is more problematic with donor eggs.

There are also some Christian leaders (especially Catholic) who are concerned about all in vitro fertility therapies because they disrupt the natural act of conceiving a child where gamete donations, both egg and [[sperm donation]]s, are seen to "compromise the marital bond and family integrity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albertmohler.com/commentary_read.php?cdate=2006-05-10|title=AlbertMohler.com|work=AlbertMohler.com|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they encourage infertile couples to consider adoption instead.

In the Orthodox Jewish community there is no consensus as to whether an egg donor needs to be Jewish in order for the child to be considered Jewish from birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yoatzot.org/article.php?id=112|title=Egg Donation|publisher=Yoatzot.org|accessdate=5 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105174451/http://www.yoatzot.org/article.php?id=112|archivedate=5 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s religious authorities said that if the birth mother was Jewish that the child would be Jewish as well, but in the past few years rabbis in Israel have begun to reconsider, which in turn is causing more debate around the world. Conservative Rabbi Elliot Dorff has suggested that there are arguments for both sides (birth mother or genetic mother) in religious scripture. Dean of the Center for the Jewish Future at Yeshiva University believes that any child where the birth mother or the genetic mother isn't Jewish should go through a conversion process in infancy, to be sure that their Judaism isn't questioned later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/what-makes-a-jewish-mother/|title=What Makes a Jewish Mother|first=Caren|last=Chesler|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not an issue in the reform community for two reasons. First, only one parent must be Jewish for the child to be considered Jewish; thus, if the father is Jewish, the mother's religion is irrelevant. Second, if the mother who carries the pregnancy and gives birth is Jewish, reform Jews will generally consider that child to be Jewish from birth because it was born of a Jewish mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/patrilineal1.html|title=Reform Movement's Resolution on Patrilineal Descent (March 1983) - Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eudaimonia'''  ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary:εὐδαιμονία|εὐδαιμονία]] {{IPA-el|eu̯dai̯moníaː|}}), sometimes [[anglicized]] as '''eudaemonia''' or '''eudemonia''' {{IPAc-en|j|uː|d|ɪ|ˈ|m|oʊ|n|i|ə}}, is a Greek word commonly translated as [[happiness]] or [[welfare]]; however, "human [[flourishing]] or [[prosperity]]" has been proposed as a more accurate translation.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel N. Robinson. (1999). Aristotle's Psychology. Published by Daniel N. Robinson. {{ISBN|0-9672066-0-X}} {{ISBN|978-0967206608}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Citing a book without a page number , making it impractical for others to verify, does not fulfill Wikipedia's requirement for verifiability|date=April 2018}} Etymologically, it consists of the words "''eu''" ("good") and "''[[daemon (mythology)|daimōn]]''" ("spirit"). It is a central concept in [[Aristotelian ethics]] and [[political philosophy]], along with the terms "[[arete (moral virtue)|aretē]]", most often translated as "[[virtue]]" or "excellence", and "[[phronesis]]", often translated as "practical or ethical wisdom".&lt;ref name=twsJun5e&gt;{{cite news|author=Rosalind Hursthouse|title=Virtue Ethics|publisher=''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''|quote=But although modern virtue ethics does not have to take the form known as "neo-Aristotelian", almost any modern version still shows that its roots are in ancient Greek philosophy by the employment of three concepts derived from it. These are areté (excellence or virtue) phronesis (practical or moral wisdom) and eudaimonia (usually translated as happiness or flourishing.) As modern virtue ethics has grown and more people have become familiar with its literature, the understanding of these terms has increased, but it is still the case that readers familiar only with modern philosophy tend to misinterpret them.|date=July 18, 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Aristotle]]'s works, eudaimonia (based on older Greek tradition) was used as the term for the highest human good, and so it is the aim of practical philosophy, including [[ethics]] and [[political philosophy]], to consider (and also experience) what it really is, and how it can be achieved.

Discussion of the links between virtue of character (''ēthikē aretē'') and happiness ''(eudaimonia)'' is one of the central concerns of ancient ethics, and a subject of much disagreement. As a result there are many varieties of eudaimonism. Two of the most influential forms are those of Aristotle&lt;ref name=twsJun5a&gt;{{cite news|author=Verena von Pfetten|title=5 Things Happy People Do|publisher=''Huffington Post''|quote=But researchers now believe that eudaimonic well-being may be more important. Cobbled from the Greek eu ("good") and daimon ("spirit" or "deity"), eudaimonia means striving toward excellence based on one's unique talents and potential—Aristotle considered it to be the noblest goal in life. In his time, the Greeks believed that each child was blessed at birth with a personal daimon embodying the highest possible expression of his or her nature. One way they envisioned the daimon was as a golden figurine that would be revealed by cracking away an outer layer of cheap pottery (the person's baser exterior). The effort to know and realize one's most golden self—"personal growth," in today's vernacular—is now the central concept of eudaimonia, which has also come to include continually taking on new challenges and fulfilling one's sense of purpose in life.|date=4 September 2008|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/04/5-things-happy-people-do_n_124002.html|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Stoicism|Stoics]]. Aristotle takes virtue and its exercise to be the most important constituent in eudaimonia but acknowledges also the importance of external goods such as health, wealth, and beauty. By contrast, the Stoics make virtue necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia and thus deny the necessity of external goods.&lt;ref name="Klein2012"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jacob |last=Klein |year=2012 |title=Reason, Religion, and Natural Law: From Plato to Spinoza |publisher=OUP USA |isbn=9780199767175 |lccn=2012001316 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ONF3OLtRx2kC&amp;pg=PA63 |pages=63–64 |quote=According to Irwin, the Stoic thesis that loss and tragedy do not affect an agent's welfare does not imply that a rational agent has no reason to regret such a loss, for on Irwin's account of Stoic theory the life of virtue and happiness and the life that accords with nature constitute independently rational aims... A number of considerations tell against this interpretation, however. One such consideration is merely an ''ex silentio'' appeal. No Stoic source, to my knowledge, suggests that actions may be justified with respect to anything other than what contributes to the end of happiness, and virtue alone does this in the Stoics view. A few texts, moreover, are explicit on this point. Cicero's summary of Stoics' ethics in ''De finibus'' 3 considers and rejects the suggestion that Stoic theory is implicitly committed to two final ends, virtue and a life that accords with nature, where these are conceived as independent objectives at which a rational agent might aim... Independent, that is, in the strong sense according to which one of these rational objectives may be realized while the other is not. See Irwin (2007), p. 316: 'Virtuous action. therefore, is not sufficient for achieving the life according to nature, which includes the natural advantages.' Irwin is certainly correct to point out that virtue is not sufficient for attaining the natural advantages, preferred indifferents such as health and wealth. But it is the Stoics' critics, not the Stoics themselves, who maintain that the actual possession of these items is a necessary condition of the life according to nature.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The ''[[Definitions (Plato)|Definitions]]'', a dictionary of Greek philosophical terms attributed to [[Plato]] himself but believed by modern scholars to have been written by his immediate followers in  [[Platonic Academy|the Academy]],  provides the following definition of the word eudaimonia: "The good composed of all goods; an ability which suffices for living well; perfection in respect of virtue; resources sufficient for a living creature."

In his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (§21; 1095a15–22), Aristotle says that everyone agrees that eudaimonia is the highest good for human beings, but that there is substantial disagreement on what sort of life counts as doing and living well; i.e. eudaimon:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Verbally there is a very general agreement; for both the general run of men and people of superior refinement say that it is [eudaimonia], and identify living well and faring well with being happy; but with regard to what [eudaimonia] is they differ, and the many do not give the same account as the wise. For the former think it is some plain and obvious thing like pleasure, wealth or honour… [1095a17]&lt;ref name=twsJun5c&gt;{{cite news|author=Aristotle, also David Ross, Lesley Brown|title=The Nicomachean Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|quote=Verbally there is very general agreement, for both the general run of men and people of superior refinement...|year=1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JHkp7t6ISvEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=Verbally+there+is+a+very+general+agreement%3B+for+both+the+general+run+of+men+and+people+of+superior+refinement+say+that+it+is&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QI2bp7lMzx&amp;sig=SVWPQlfkhX3jxPSss8KC-U-RIGw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fG0KTOaEEIL58AakkJmMBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=very%20general%20agreement&amp;f=false|accessdate= 2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So, as Aristotle points out, saying that eudaimon life is a life which is objectively desirable, and means living well, is not saying very much. Everyone wants to be eudaimon; and everyone agrees that being eudaimon is related to faring well and to an individual's well being. The really difficult question is to specify just what sort of activities enable one to live well. Aristotle presents various popular conceptions of the best life for human beings. The candidates that he mentions are a (1) life of pleasure, (2) a life of political activity and (3) a philosophical life.

One important move in Greek philosophy to answer the question of how to achieve eudaimonia is to bring in another important concept in ancient philosophy, "arete" ("[[virtue]]"). Aristotle says that the eudaimon life is one of "virtuous activity in accordance with reason" [1097b22&amp;ndash;1098a20]. And even [[Epicurus]] who argues that the eudaimon life is the life of pleasure maintains that the life of pleasure coincides with the life of virtue. So the ancient ethical theorists tend to agree that virtue is closely bound up with happiness (areté is bound up with eudaimonia). However, they disagree on the way in which this is so. We shall consider the main theories in a moment, but first a warning about the proper translation of areté.

As already noted, the Greek word areté is usually translated into English as "virtue". One problem with this is that we are inclined to understand virtue in a moral sense, which is not always what the ancients had in mind. For a Greek, areté pertains to all sorts of qualities we would not regard as relevant to ethics, for example, physical beauty. So it is important to bear in mind that the sense of ‘virtue' operative in ancient ethics is not exclusively moral and includes more than states such as wisdom, courage and compassion. The sense of virtue which areté connotes would include saying something like "speed is a virtue in a horse", or "height is a virtue in a basketball player". Doing anything well requires virtue, and each characteristic activity (such as carpentry, flute playing, etc.) has its own set of virtues. The alternative translation "excellence" (or "a desirable quality") might be helpful in conveying this general meaning of the term. The moral virtues are simply a subset of the general sense in which a human being is capable of functioning well or excellently.

Positive Psychology defines Eudaimonia as a self-discovery, perceived development of one's best potentials, a sense of purpose and meaning in life, intense involvement in activities, investment of significant effort, and enjoyment of activities as personally expressive, deep relationships.&lt;ref&gt;https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/ws/files/4275774/3168522.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and translation==
In terms of its etymology, eudaimonia is an abstract noun derived from ''eu'' meaning "well" and ''daimon'' (daemon), which refers to a minor deity or a guardian spirit.&lt;ref name=twsJun5a/&gt;

Eudaimonia implies a positive and divine state of being that humanity is able to strive toward and possibly reach. A literal view of eudaimonia means achieving a state of being similar to benevolent deity, or being protected and looked after by a benevolent deity. As this would be considered the most positive state to be in, the word is often translated as 'happiness' although incorporating the divine nature of the word extends the meaning to also include the concepts of being fortunate, or blessed. Despite this etymology, however, discussions of eudaimonia in ancient Greek ethics are often conducted independently of any super-natural significance.

In his ''Nicomachean Ethics,'' (1095a15&amp;ndash;22) [[Aristotle]] says that eudaimonia means 'doing and living well'. It is significant that synonyms for eudaimonia are living well and doing well. On the standard English translation, this would be to say that ‘[[happiness]] is doing well and living well'. The word ‘happiness' does not entirely capture the meaning of the Greek word. One important difference is that happiness often connotes being or tending to be in a certain pleasant state of mind. For example, when we say that someone is "a very happy person", we usually mean that they seem subjectively contented with the way things are going in their life. We mean to imply that they feel good about the way things are going for them. In contrast, eudaimonia is a more encompassing notion than feeling happy since events that do not contribute to one's experience of feeling happy may affect one's eudaimonia.

Eudaimonia depends on all the things that would make us happy if we knew of their existence, but quite independently of whether we do know about them. Ascribing eudaimonia to a person, then, may include ascribing such things as being virtuous, being loved and having good friends. But these are all objective judgments about someone's life: they concern a person's really being virtuous, really being loved, and really having fine friends. This implies that a person who has evil sons and daughters will not be judged to be eudaimonic even if he or she does not know that they are evil and feels pleased and contented with the way they have turned out (happy). Conversely, being loved by your children would not count towards your happiness if you did not know that they loved you (and perhaps thought that they did not), but it would count towards your eudaimonia. So eudaimonia corresponds to the idea of having an objectively good or desirable life, to some extent independently of whether one knows that certain things exist or not. It includes conscious experiences of well being, success, and failure, but also a whole lot more. (See Aristotle's discussion: ''Nicomachean Ethics,'' book 1.10–1.11.)

Because of this discrepancy between the meaning of eudaimonia and happiness, some alternative translations have been proposed. W.D. Ross suggests "well-being" and John Cooper proposes "flourishing". These translations may avoid some of the misleading associations carried by "happiness" although each tends to raise some problems of its own. In some modern texts therefore, the other alternative is to leave the term in an English form of the original Greek, as "eudaimonia".

==Main views on eudaimonia and its relation to aretē==

===Socrates===
[[File:David - The Death of Socrates detail.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a painting.|French painter [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] portrayed the philosopher in ''[[The Death of Socrates]]'' (1787).]]
What we know of [[Socrates]]' philosophy is almost entirely derived from Plato's writings. Scholars typically divide Plato's works into three periods: the early, middle, and late periods. They tend to agree also that Plato's earliest works quite faithfully represent the teachings of Socrates and that Plato's own views, which go beyond those of Socrates, appear for the first time in the middle works such as the ''[[Phaedo]]'' and the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]].'' This division will be employed here in dividing up the positions of Socrates and Plato on eudaimonia.

As with all other ancient ethical thinkers, Socrates thought that all human beings wanted eudaimonia more than anything else. (see Plato, ''Apology'' 30b, ''Euthydemus'' 280d&amp;ndash;282d, ''Meno'' 87d&amp;ndash;89a). However, Socrates adopted a quite radical form of eudaimonism (see above): he seems to have thought that [[virtue]] is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. Socrates is convinced that virtues such as self-control, courage, justice, piety, wisdom and related qualities of mind and soul are absolutely crucial if a person is to lead a good and happy (eudaimon) life. Virtues guarantee a happy life eudaimonia. For example, in the ''Meno'', with respect to wisdom, he says: "everything the soul endeavours or endures under the guidance of wisdom ends in happiness" [''Meno'' 88c].

In the ''Apology,'' Socrates clearly presents his disagreement with those who think that the eudaimon life is the life of honour or pleasure, when he chastises the Athenians for caring more for riches and honour than the state of their souls.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Good Sir, you are an Athenian, a [[citizenship|citizen]] of the greatest city with the greatest reputation for both wisdom and power; are you not ashamed of your eagerness to possess as much wealth, reputation, and honors as possible, while you do not care for nor give thought to wisdom or truth or the best possible state of your soul [29e].&lt;ref name=twsJun5d&gt;{{cite news|author=Uncertain|title=How "God" functioned in Socrates' life|publisher=DD:Religion|quote=Men of Athens, I am grateful and I am your friend, but I will obey the god rather than you, and as long as I draw breath and am able, I shall not cease to practice philosophy, to exhort you and in my usual way to point out to any of you whom I happen to meet: "Good Sir, you are an Athenian, a citizen of the greatest city with the greatest reputation for both wisdom and power; are you not ashamed of your eagerness to possess as much wealth, reputation and honors as possible, while you do not care for nor give thought to wisdom or truth, or the best possible state of your soul?"|date=19 September 2008|url=http://www.ohiodialogues.org/nugget/how-god-functioned-socrates-life|accessdate=2010-06-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226163749/http://www.ohiodialogues.org/nugget/how-god-functioned-socrates-life|archivedate=26 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... it does not seem like human nature for me to have neglected all my own affairs and to have tolerated this neglect for so many years while I was always concerned with you, approaching each one of you like a father or an elder brother to persuade you to care for ''virtue''. [31a&amp;ndash;b; italics added]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It emerges a bit further on that this concern for one's soul, that one's soul might be in the best possible state, amounts to acquiring moral virtue. So Socrates' point that the Athenians should care for their souls means that they should care for their virtue, rather than pursuing honour or riches. Virtues are states of the soul. When a soul has been properly cared for and perfected it possesses the virtues. Moreover, according to Socrates, this state of the soul, moral virtue, is the most important good. The health of the soul is incomparably more important for eudaimonia than (e.g.) wealth and political power. Someone with a virtuous soul is better off than someone who is wealthy and honoured but whose soul is corrupted by unjust actions. This view is confirmed in the ''Crito'', where Socrates gets Crito to agree that the perfection of the soul, virtue, is the most important good:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And is life worth living for us with that part of us corrupted that unjust action harms and just action benefits? Or do we think that part of us, whatever it is, that is concerned with justice and injustice, is inferior to the body? Not at all. It is much more valuable…? Much more… (47e–48a)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Here Socrates argues that life is not worth living if the soul is ruined by wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=twsJun5f&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Parry|title=Ancient Ethical Theory|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|quote=Socrates says that a man worth anything at all does not reckon whether his course of action endangers his life or threatens death. He looks only at one thing — whether what he does is just or not, the work of a good or of a bad man (28b&amp;ndash;c).|date=Aug 7, 2009|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ancient/|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, Socrates seems to think that virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. A person who is not virtuous cannot be happy, and a person with virtue cannot fail to be happy. We shall see later on that Stoic ethics takes its cue from this Socratic insight.

===Plato===
Plato's great work of the middle period, the ''Republic'', is devoted to answering a challenge made by the [[sophist]] [[Thrasymachus]], that conventional morality, particularly the 'virtue' of justice, actually prevents the strong man from achieving eudaimonia. Thrasymachus's views are restatements of a position which Plato discusses earlier on in his writings, in the ''Gorgias'', through the mouthpiece of Callicles. The basic argument presented by Thrasymachus and Callicles is that justice (being just) hinders or prevents the achievement of eudaimonia because conventional morality requires that we control ourselves and hence live with un-satiated desires. This idea is vividly illustrated in book 2 of the ''Republic'' when Glaucon, taking up Thrasymachus' challenge, recounts a myth of the magical ring of Gyges. According to the myth, Gyges becomes king of Lydia when he stumbles upon a magical ring, which, when he turns it a particular way, makes him invisible, so that he can satisfy any desire he wishes without fear of punishment. When he discovers the power of the ring he kills the king, marries his wife and takes over the throne. The thrust of Glaucon's challenge is that no one would be just if he could escape the retribution he would normally encounter for fulfilling his desires at whim. But if eudaimonia is to be achieved through the satisfaction of desire, whereas being just or acting justly requires suppression of desire, then it is not in the interests of the strong man to act according to the dictates of conventional morality. (This general line of argument reoccurs much later in the philosophy of [[Nietzsche]].) Throughout the rest of the ''Republic'', Plato aims to refute this claim by showing that the [[virtue of justice]] is necessary for eudaimonia.
[[File:Plato and Aristotle in The School of Athens, by italian Rafael.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[The School of Athens]] by [[Raffaello Sanzio]], 1509, showing [[Plato]] (left) and [[Aristotle]] (right)]]

The argument of the ''Republic'' is lengthy and complex. In brief, Plato argues that virtues are states of the soul, and that the just person is someone whose soul is ordered and harmonious, with all its parts functioning properly to the person's benefit. In contrast, Plato argues that the unjust man's soul, without the virtues, is chaotic and at war with itself, so that even if he were able to satisfy most of his desires, his lack of inner harmony and unity thwart any chance he has of achieving eudaimonia. Plato's ethical theory is eudaimonistic because it maintains that eudaimonia depends on virtue. On Plato's version of the relationship, virtue is depicted as the most crucial and the dominant constituent of eudaimonia.

===Aristotle===
Aristotle's account is articulated in the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and the ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]''. In outline, for Aristotle, eudaimonia involves activity, exhibiting virtue (''[[arete (moral virtue)|aretē]]'' sometimes translated as excellence) in accordance with [[reason]]. This conception of eudaimonia derives from Aristotle's [[essentialism|essentialist]] understanding of [[human nature]], the view that [[reason]] (''logos'' sometimes translated as [[rationality]]) is unique to human beings and that the ideal function or work (''ergon'') of a human being is the fullest or most perfect exercise of reason. Basically, well being (eudaimonia) is gained by proper development of one's highest and most human capabilities and human beings are "the rational animal". It follows that eudaimonia for a human being is the attainment of excellence (''areté'') in reason.

According to Aristotle, eudaimonia actually requires [[energeia|activity]], action, so that it is not sufficient for a person to possess a squandered ability or disposition. Eudaimonia requires not only good character but rational activity. Aristotle clearly maintains that to live in accordance with reason means achieving excellence thereby. Moreover, he claims this excellence cannot be isolated and so competencies are also required appropriate to related functions. For example, if being a truly outstanding scientist requires impressive math skills,  one might say "doing mathematics well is necessary to be a first rate scientist". From this it follows that eudaimonia, living well, consists in activities exercising the rational part of the psyche in accordance with the virtues or excellency of reason [1097b22&amp;ndash;1098a20]. Which is to say, to be fully engaged in the intellectually stimulating and fulfilling work at which one achieves well-earned success. The rest of the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' is devoted to filling out the claim that the best life for a human being is the life of excellence in accordance with reason. Since reason for Aristotle is not only theoretical but practical as well, he spends quite a bit of time discussing excellence of character, which enables a person to exercise his practical reason (i.e., reason relating to action) successfully.

Aristotle's ethical theory is eudaimonist because it maintains that eudaimonia depends on virtue. However, it is Aristotle's explicit view that virtue is necessary but not sufficient for eudaimonia. While emphasizing the importance of the rational aspect of the psyche, he does not ignore the importance of other ‘goods' such as friends, wealth, and power in a life that is eudaimonic. He doubts the likelihood of being eudaimonic if one lacks certain external goods such as ‘good birth, good children, and beauty'. So, a person who is hideously ugly or has "lost children or good friends through death" (1099b5–6), or who is isolated, is unlikely to be eudaimon. In this way, "dumb luck" ([[Chance (philosophy)|chance]]) can preempt one's attainment of eudaimonia.

===Epicurus===
[[File:Epicurus-PergamonMuseum.png|thumb|left|alt=Sculpture of a face.|[[Epicurus]] identified eudaimonia with the life of pleasure.]]
[[Epicurus]]' ethical theory is [[Hedonism|hedonistic]]. (His view proved very influential on the founders and best proponents of [[utilitarianism]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]].) Hedonism is the view that pleasure is the only intrinsic good and that pain is the only intrinsic bad. An object, experience or state of affairs is intrinsically valuable if it is good simply because of what it is. Intrinsic value is to be contrasted with instrumental value. An object, experience or state of affairs is instrumentally valuable if it serves as a means to what is intrinsically valuable. To see this, consider the following example. Suppose a person spends their days and nights in an office, working at not entirely pleasant activities for the purpose of receiving money. Someone asks them "why do you want the money?", and they answer: "So, I can buy an apartment overlooking the ocean, and a red sports car." This answer expresses the point that money is instrumentally valuable because its value lies in what one obtains by means of it – in this case, the money is a means to getting an apartment and a sports car and the value of making this money dependent on the price of these commodities.

Epicurus identifies the good life with the life of pleasure. He understands eudaimonia as a more or less continuous experience of pleasure and, also, freedom from pain and distress. But it is important to notice that Epicurus does not advocate that one pursue any and every pleasure. Rather, he recommends a policy whereby pleasures are maximized "in the long run". In other words, Epicurus claims that some pleasures are not worth having because they lead to greater pains, and some pains are worthwhile when they lead to greater pleasures. The best strategy for attaining a maximal amount of pleasure overall is not to seek instant gratification but to work out a sensible long term policy.

Ancient Greek ethics is eudaimonist because it links virtue and eudaimonia, where eudaimonia refers to an individual's well being. Epicurus' doctrine can be considered eudaimonist since Epicurus argues that a life of pleasure will coincide with a life of virtue. He believes that we  do and ought to seek virtue because virtue brings pleasure. Epicurus' basic doctrine is that a life of virtue is the life which generates the most amount of pleasure, and it is for this reason that we ought to be virtuous. This thesis—the eudaimon life is the pleasurable life—is not a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] as "eudaimonia is the good life" would be: rather, it is the substantive and controversial claim that a life of pleasure and absence of pain is what eudaimonia consists in.

One important difference between Epicurus' eudaimonism and that of Plato and Aristotle is that for the latter virtue is a constituent of eudaimonia, whereas Epicurus makes virtue a means to happiness. To this difference, consider Aristotle's theory. Aristotle maintains that eudaimonia is what everyone wants (and Epicurus would agree). He also thinks that eudaimonia is best achieved by a life of virtuous activity in accordance with reason. The virtuous person takes pleasure in doing the right thing as a result of a proper training of moral and intellectual character (See e.g., ''Nicomachean Ethics'' 1099a5). However, Aristotle does not think that virtuous activity is pursued for the sake of pleasure. Pleasure is a byproduct of virtuous action: it does not enter at all into the reasons why virtuous action is virtuous. Aristotle does not think that we literally aim for eudaimonia. Rather, eudaimonia is what we achieve (assuming that we aren't particularly unfortunate in the possession of external goods) when we live according to the requirements of reason. Virtue is the largest constituent in a eudaimon life.
By contrast, Epicurus holds that virtue is the means to achieve happiness. His theory is eudaimonist in that he holds that virtue is indispensable to happiness; but virtue is not a constituent of a eudaimon life, and being virtuous is not (external goods aside) identical with being eudaimon. Rather, according to Epicurus, virtue is only instrumentally related to happiness. So whereas Aristotle would not say that one ought to aim for virtue in order to attain pleasure, Epicurus would endorse this claim.

===The Stoics===
[[File:Raffael 070.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] thought happiness was a "good flow of life." ]]
&lt;!-- [[File:Zeno of Citium.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Drawing of a sculpture.|Zeno of Citium thought happiness was a "good flow of life."]] --&gt;
Stoic philosophy begins with [[Zeno of Citium]] c.300 BC, and was developed by [[Cleanthes]] (331&amp;ndash;232 BC) and [[Chrysippus]] (c.280–c.206 BC) into a formidable systematic unity.&lt;ref name=twsJun5g&gt;{{cite news|author=Dirk Baltzly|title=Stoicism|publisher=''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''|quote=But what is happiness? The Epicureans' answer was deceptively straightforward: the happy life is the one which is most pleasant. (But their account of what the highest pleasure consists in was not at all straightforward.) Zeno's answer was "a good flow of life" (Arius Didymus, 63A) or "living in agreement", and Cleanthes clarified that with the formulation that the end was "living in agreement with nature" (Arius Didymus, 63B). Chrysippus amplified this to (among other formulations) "living in accordance with experience of what happens by nature"; later Stoics inadvisably, in response to Academic attacks, substituted such formulations as "the rational selection of the primary things according to nature". The Stoics' specification of what happiness consists in cannot be adequately understood apart from their views about value and human psychology.|date=Feb 7, 2008|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeno believed happiness was a "good flow of life"; Cleanthes suggested it was "living in agreement with nature", and Chrysippus believed it was "living in accordance with experience of what happens by nature".&lt;ref name=twsJun5g/&gt; Stoic ethics is a particularly strong version of eudaimonism. According to the Stoics, virtue is necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. (This thesis is generally regarded as stemming from the Socrates of Plato's earlier dialogues.) We saw earlier that the conventional Greek concept of arete is not quite the same as that denoted by ''virtue'', which has Christian connotations of charity, patience, and uprightness, since arete includes many non-moral virtues such as physical strength and beauty. However, the Stoic concept of arete is much nearer to the Christian conception of virtue, which refers to the moral virtues. However, unlike Christian understandings of virtue, righteousness or piety, the Stoic conception does not place as great an emphasis on mercy, forgiveness, self-abasement (i.e. the ritual process of declaring complete powerlessness and humility before God), charity and self-sacrificial love, though these behaviors/mentalities are not necessarily spurned by the Stoics (they are spurned by some other philosophers of Antiquity). Rather Stoicism emphasizes states such as justice, honesty, moderation, simplicity, self-discipline, resolve, fortitude, and courage (states which Christianity also encourages).

The Stoics make a radical claim that the eudaimon life is the morally virtuous life. Moral virtue is good, and moral vice is bad, and everything else, such as health, honour and riches, are merely "neutral".&lt;ref name=twsJun5g/&gt; The Stoics therefore are committed to saying that external goods such as wealth and physical beauty are not really good at all. Moral virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. In this, they are akin to [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosophers such as [[Antisthenes]] and [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]] in denying the importance to eudaimonia of external goods and circumstances, such as were recognized by Aristotle, who thought that severe misfortune (such as the death of one's family and friends) could rob even the most virtuous person of eudaimonia. This Stoic doctrine re-emerges later in the history of ethical philosophy in the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]], who argues that the possession of a "good will" is the only unconditional good. One difference is that whereas the Stoics regard external goods as neutral, as neither good nor bad, Kant's position seems to be that external goods are good, but only so far as they are a condition to achieving happiness.

=="Modern Moral Philosophy"==
Interest in the concept of eudaimonia and ancient ethical theory more generally enjoyed a revival in the twentieth century. [[G. E. M. Anscombe]] in her article "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" (1958) argued that [[duty]]-based conceptions of morality are conceptually incoherent for they are based on the idea of a "law without a lawgiver".&lt;ref name=twsJun5h&gt;{{cite news|title=The ethics of virtue: The Ethics of Virtue and the Ethics of Right Action|publisher=wutsamada.com|quote=legalistic ethics rest on the incoherent notion of a "law" without a lawgiver: DCT unacceptable; and the alternative sources of moral "legislation" are inadequate substitutes|date=2010-06-05|url=http://www.wutsamada.com/alma/ethics/rachelsd.htm|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims a system of morality conceived along the lines of the [[Ten Commandments]] depends on someone having made these rules.&lt;ref name=twsJun5i&gt;{{cite news|author=G.

The first is that it is not profitable for us at present to do moral philosophy; that should be laid aside at any rate until we have an adequate philosophy of psychology, in which we are conspicuously lacking. The second is that the concepts of obligation, and duty&amp;mdash;moral obligation and moral duty, that is to say—and of what is morally right and wrong, and of the moral sense of "ought", ought to be jettisoned if this is psychologically possible; because they are survivals, or derivatives from survivals, from an earlier conception of ethics which no longer generally survives, and are only harmful without it. My third thesis is that the differences between the well‑known English writers on moral philosophy from Sidgwick to the present day are of little importance.|date=January 1958|url=http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/cmt/mmp.html|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anscombe recommends a return to the eudaimonistic ethical theories of the ancients, particularly Aristotle, which ground morality in the interests and well being of human moral agents, and can do so without appealing to any such lawgiver.

[[Julia Driver]] in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Anscombe's article ''Modern Moral Philosophy'' stimulated the development of virtue ethics as an alternative to Utilitarianism, Kantian Ethics, and Social Contract theories. Her primary charge in the article is that, as secular approaches to moral theory, they are without foundation. They use concepts such as "morally ought", "morally obligated", "morally right", and so forth that are legalistic and require a legislator as the source of [[moral authority]]. In the past God occupied that role, but systems that dispense with God as part of the theory are lacking the proper foundation for meaningful employment of those concepts.&lt;ref name=twsJun5j&gt;{{cite news|author=Julia Driver|title=Gertrude Elizabeth Margaret Anscombe: 5.1 Virtue Ethics|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|quote=In the past God occupied that role, but systems that dispense with God as part of the theory are lacking the proper foundation for meaningful employment of those concepts.|date=Jul 21, 2009|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anscombe/#VirEth|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Eudaimonic well-being Joshanloo.jpg|thumb|Eudaimonic well-being in 166 nations based on Gallup World Poll data]]

Models of eudaimonia in [[psychology]] emerged from early work on [[self-actualization]] and the means of its accomplishment by researchers such as [[Erik Erikson]], [[Gordon Allport]], and [[Abraham Maslow]].&lt;ref name=ryff1989&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ryff | first1 = C.

Central theories are Diener's [[tripartite model of subjective well-being]], Ryff's [[Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being]], Keyes work on [[flourishing]], and Seligman's contributions to positive psychology and his theories on ''authentic happiness'' and P.E.R.M.A. Related concepts are [[happiness]], [[flourishing]], [[quality of life]], [[contentment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5|pages=6–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[meaningful life]].

The '''European Institute for Biomedical Imaging Research''' (EIBIR) was established in 2006 as a non-profit, limited liability company on the initiative of the [[European Society of Radiology]] with funding of the [[European Commission]] within the [[Sixth Framework Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=European Commission|title=EIBIR on CORDIS|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/86498_en.html|website=Community Research and Development Information Service|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=The European Institute for Biomedical Imaging Research|title=The EIBIR project (FP6)|url=http://www.eibir.org/projects/fp6-project/|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
EIBIR aims to improve cooperation between research institutes, academic departments and industry that form the European [[biomedical imaging]] community with the goal of improving the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases. It actively supports research networking activities and common initiatives and interoperability in the field of biomedical imaging research.

The majority of its efforts concern [[project management]] services for ongoing collaborative research projects, coordination of multi-center [[clinical trial]]s, and support during the preparation of project proposals under the European Commission's [[Horizon 2020]] framework.

The current research focus lies in radiology, molecular imaging and imaging biomarkers. The main target audiences include physicians, [[physicist]]s, [[radiographer]]s, [[chemist]]s, [[mathematician]]s, [[biologist|molecular biologists]], [[computer scientist]]s.

== History ==
In 2000, the idea of creating a body that would work to improve European image-related research activities emerged within the former European Association of Radiology (EAR) which was later integrated into the European Society for Radiology (ESR). 	 

In 2002, the EAR created a committee to supervise imaging research activities in Europe, and to offer advice on how to establish a body tasked with improving and coordinating biomedical imaging research in Europe.

At the [[European Congress of Radiology]] in 2004, the committee presented an overview of the existing European [[research infrastructure]]. The committee recommended determining partners in order to properly establish a pan-European research institute, analogous to the [[National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering]] in the United States. Based on these recommendations, a second committee was created with the aim to build a network of research centers of excellence in biomedical imaging, and creating possibilities for the education and strengthening of biomedical imaging research and training throughout Europe. 	 

An action plan entitled "Towards a European Institute for Biomedical Imaging Research" was developed by the second committee in 2005, and submitted within the 6th Framework Programme to the European Commission.

In 2006, the action plan was approved and led to the official establishment of EIBIR as a non-profit limited liability company with its registered office in [[Vienna]], Austria. EIBIR received financial support from a core group of industry partners in order to facilitate the establishment of its operational structures and to initiate projects at a research level. [[Bayer Schering Pharma]], [[Bracco (company)|Bracco]], [[GE Healthcare]], [[Philips]] and [[Siemens Healthcare]] were the founding members of the EIBIR Industry Panel. 	 

From 2008 onward, EIBIR took over the coordination of several collaborative research projects supported within the European Commission's [[Seventh Framework Programme]] and collaborated in additional projects.

By 2009, EIBIR's network and activities had grown to a point where there was a need for a strategic plan to ensure efficiency, viability and a focused use of its resources; Service packages were introduced for network members, industry partners and shareholder organisations in order to allow EIBIR to maintain and improve its services.

== Research project ==
As of May 2015, EIBIR has been, or currently is, involved in the following projects;
* '''Euro-BioImaging''' – European Research Infrastructure for Imaging Technologies in Biological and Biomedical Sciences, [http://www.eurobioimaging.eu/]
* '''VPH-PRISM'''‡ – Virtual Physiological Human: Personalized Predictive Breast Cancer Therapy through Integrated Tissue Micro-Structure Modeling, [http://www.vph-prism.eu/]

‡ ''under project coordination of EIBIR''

== Structure ==
EIBIR is managed by an executive director and its offices are located in Vienna, Austria. The scientific activities of EIBIR are led by a [[scientific advisory board]], which is chaired by the [[scientific director]]. Within EIBIR there currently are seven thematic working groups collaborating on multiple aspects ranging from education to initializing collaborative research projects. The themes covered by these working groups are;
* Biomedical image analysis
* Assessment of imaging in medicine
* Cancer imaging
* Development of imaging probes
* Cell imaging

[[File:A few ground Fireworks flowers Holland.jpg|thumb|A few 'ground flowers' fireworks in the Netherlands.]]
This article deals with the '''fireworks policy in the Netherlands.'''

[[Fireworks]] in the [[Netherlands]] are mostly regulated by the ''[[:nl:Vuurwerkbesluit|Vuurwerkbesluit]]'' ("Fireworks Decree"), a 1993 law that has subsequently been amended many times to make the rules surrounding the production, testing, transportation, storage, trade, sale, consumption and overall safety of fireworks stricter. During most of the year, most fireworks are restricted to usage by professionals, but there is an exception for ordinary citizens without any special training or licence to ignite fireworks during [[New Year's Eve]] from 6 pm on 31 December to 2 am on 1 January. Especially since the 2000 [[Enschede fireworks disaster]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.trouw.nl/home/fireworks-kleine-jongen-~a8124e85/ |title=Fireworks 'kleine jongen' |work=Trouw |date=15 May 2000 |accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more so since the accident-laden [[New Year's Eve]] of 2007/08,&lt;ref name="1V08"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://eenvandaag.avrotros.nl/item/verbod-op-vuurwerk/ |title=Verbod op vuurwerk |work=EenVandaag |date=9 December 2008 |accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; public discussion on more rigorous regulation or even prohibition on (consumer) fireworks has been frequent and ongoing.&lt;ref name="Duin"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/debat-over-vuurwerk-leidt-tot-milde-aanpassing~a4545853/ |title=Debat over vuurwerk leidt tot milde aanpassing |author=Roelf Jan Duin |work=Het Parool |date=17 December 2017 |accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nrcreader.nl/artikel/3711/het-is-nu-eenmaal-traditie |title=Het is nu eenmaal traditie! |author=Max Westerman |work=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |date=31 December 2013 |accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At New Year's Eve, ordinary Dutch citizens are allowed to light fireworks from 6 pm on 31 December to 2 am on 1 January. Fireworks need to comply to certain legal standards, and may only be sold during the last three days of the year, excluding any Sundays,&lt;ref name="Vuurwerkbesluit"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0013360/2016-10-17 |title=Vuurwerkbesluit, artikel 2.3.2 |publisher=Dutch Government |date=8 September 2015 |accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a shop that has a licence.&lt;ref name="RTVOost"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.rtvoost.nl/nieuws/default.aspx?nid=260063&amp;cat=1# |title=Hoe zit het ook alweer met vuurwerk: wat mag wel en wat mag niet |work=[[RTV Oost]] |date=29 December 2016 |accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fireworks are often lit in the streets or in people's [[backyard]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

=== Koningsdag ===
During [[Koningsdag]] ("King's Day"), several municipalities throughout the country organize fireworks shows by professionals.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

=== Vuurwerkfestival Scheveningen ===
The Vuurwerkfestival Scheveningen ([[Scheveningen]] Fireworks Festival), conducted by professionals, is annually attended by around 200,000 people. In the summer of 2017, the festival experienced its 38th edition. In 2016, there were winter fireworks shows for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vuurwerkfestivalscheveningen.nl/ Vuurwerkfestival Scheveningen]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation and enforcement ==
[[File:Veiligheidsrisico's Jaarwisseling.webm|thumb|2017 [[Dutch Safety Board]] report on fireworks risks (English subtitles).]] 
=== Fireworks companies ===
The Netherlands used to host several fireworks manufacturers, but in the late 20th century, almost all production of fireworks was moved abroad. In 2000, there were 26 fireworks companies active in the Netherlands, with branches in [[Leeuwarden]], [[Appingedam]], [[Lichtenvoorde]], [[Tilburg]], [[The Hague]], [[Enschede]], [[Leiden]], [[Lijnden]], [[Dronten]], [[Lelystad]] and [[Landgraaf]]. 14 of these imported fireworks from especially [[China]] for sale on the Dutch market, the 12 other businesses conducted professional fireworks shows. In some factories such as S.E. Fireworks (which ceased producing fireworks itself in 1985), Chinese fireworks were further assembled in the Netherlands before being sold. Since the 1991 explosion of the fireworks factory in Culemborg, almost all fireworks companies operated outside of [[residential area]]s; S.E. Fireworks, which caused the 2000 [[Enschede fireworks disaster]], was the last company to still be located in the middle of a residential area before a planned relocation in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.trouw.nl/home/fireworks-kleine-jongen-~a8124e85/ |title=Fireworks 'kleine jongen' |work=Trouw |date=15 May 2000 |accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety testing ===
In the Netherlands, the [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]] (TNO) is responsible for [[safety testing of explosives|safety testing]] of fireworks.&lt;ref name="Brandpunt"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.uitzendinggemist.net/aflevering/247898/Brandpunt_Reporter.html |title=Wereldkampioen vuurwerk |author=Eliza Bergman &amp; Dirk Bayens |work=Brandpunt Reporter |publisher=[[KRO-NCRV]] |date=2 January 2014 |accessdate=26 December 2017 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, safety testing of fireworks is [[Fireworks policy in the European Union|required in the entire European Union]], but companies are allowed to test their products in one member state before importing and selling them in another.&lt;ref name="Brandpunt"/&gt; A 2010 document from the [[Ministry of Infrastructure, Public Works and Water Management|Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment]] revealed that several fireworks importers in the [[Netherlands]] did not yet comply with the new testing regulations, but were not penalised for it because a number of companies claimed they needed more time to implement the changes, and they were granted exceptions by the Ministry.&lt;ref name="Brandpunt"/&gt; Dream Fireworks owner Frits Pen, who claimed to have had his fireworks tested in [[Hungary]] for thousands of euros, sued the Ministry for failing to punish his competitors who were allowed to import and sell untested fireworks for free.&lt;ref name="Brandpunt"/&gt; In 2014, the Ministry stated that, by then, 80% of the fireworks imported into the Netherlands had a [[CE marking]] and were being checked.&lt;ref name="Brandpunt"/&gt;

According to a 2017 report by the [[Dutch Safety Board]], 25% of all fireworks tested failed to meet safety standards and were banned from sale.&lt;ref name="OVV"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.onderzoeksraad.nl/uploads/phase-docs/1679/f73dc5c1f5e020172659-publicatie-veiligheidsrisico-s-jaarwisseling-interactief-171127.pdf |title=Veiligheidsrisico’s jaarwisseling |publisher=[[Dutch Safety Board]] |date=1 December 2017 |accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Injury, damage and nuisance ===
[[File:Brievenbus oud en nieuw.jpg|thumb|A mailbox made ''hufterproof'' ("asshole-proof") to prevent vandals from inserting fireworks.]]

Fireworks in the Netherlands are known to cause various negative effects to users, bystanders and people living nearby, especially around New Year's Eve, when extra police, firefighters and paramedics are deployed to control the situation. Which measures do and do not work, and how matters may be improved without 'ruining the party', is subject to ongoing discussion. The negative effects of fireworks can be divided into:

=== National and European legislation ===
{{See also|Fireworks policy in the European Union}}
[[File:Persconferentie na de ministerraad, 11 januari 2008.webm|thumb|Prime Minister [[Jan Peter Balkenende|Balkenende]] on fireworks and other incidents during New Year's Eve 2007/08]]
The original ''Vuurwerkbesluit'' was adopted in 1993, and was primarily concerned with environmental issues. In the wake of the 2000 Enschede fireworks disaster, the Dutch government approved new rules regarding consumer and professional fireworks on 22 January 2002, especially concerning the safety of fireworks storage. Since then, the ''Vuurwerkbesluit'' has been amended a number of additional times, including the 2014 limitation of the period during which fireworks may be lit during New Year's Eve from 10 am to 6 pm on 31 December.{{cn|dtae= 29 December 2017|date=December 2017}}

Since the adoption of the [[Fireworks policy in the European Union|2007 European Pyrotechnic articles Directive]], the Dutch ''Vuurwerkbesluit'' has been amended by 2010 to harmonise legislation with that of other EU member states concerning, amongst other things, the categorisation, trade and safety of fireworks, and a common approach of countering illegal fireworks. The updated 2013 Pyrotechnic articles Directive led to another amendment of the ''Vuurwerkbesluit''.{{cn|dtae= 29 December 2017|date=December 2017}}

So-called "consumer fireworks" (''consumentenvuurwerk'' or ''particulier vuurwerk'') in the Netherlands consists of category F1 (on sale and usable throughout the year by every citizen aged 12 and older without a special licence or training),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/editienl/laatste-videos-editienl/hele-jaar-door-legaal-knallen |title=Hele jaar door legaal knallen |work=EditieNL |publisher=RTL Nieuws |date=7 December 2017 |accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and category F2 and F3 (on sale the last three days of the year, Sundays excepted, which are to be lit from 6 pm on 31 December until 2 am on 1 January). Category F4 is reserved for professionals, and aside from New Year's Eve, categories F2 and F3 are also reserved for professionals. In Belgium, Germany and Denmark, the sale of all category F3 fireworks to consumers is forbidden, but in the Netherlands, some fireworks in this category may be purchased by lay people.&lt;ref name="OVV"/&gt;

Since 2011, the [[Attorney general#Netherlands|Dutch College of Attorney Gerenals]] has pushed for stricter European rules on fireworks, to prevent category F4 fireworks from being bought in other EU countries and smuggled into the Netherlands. Because of "flaws in the Pyrotechnic articles Directive", there are dangers for local security and [[terrorist]] threats.&lt;ref name="Brandpunt"/&gt;

The Netherlands also have a considerable [[illegal fireworks]] problem. In 2014, about 1 million kilos of illegal fireworks entered the country annually.&lt;ref name="Brandpunt"/&gt; According to inquiries by VeiligheidNL, illegal fireworks used to cause most fireworks-related injuries, (in 2012/13 almost two-thirds of all fireworks-related injuries), but since New Year's Eve of 2013/14 more than half was caused by legal fireworks. Illegal fireworks were responsible for more serious injuries, however, and resulted in four times as many hospitalisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://nos.nl/artikel/593555-meer-ernstig-letsel-door-vuurwerk.html |title=Meer ernstig letsel door vuurwerk |author=Rinke van den Brink &amp; Hugo van der Parre |work=NOS |date=4 January 2014 |accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014/15, the percentage of injuries by illegal fireworks decreased to almost 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/01/03/laagste-aantal-vuurwerkslachtoffers-in-25-jaar-a1410388 |title=Laagste aantal vuurwerkslachtoffers in 25 jaar |author=Eva Smal |work=NRC Handelsblad |date=3 January 2016 |accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During New Year's Eve 2015/16 and 2016/17, illegal fireworks were to blame for about 25% of fireworks-related injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://nos.nl/artikel/2151297-daling-aantal-vuurwerkslachtoffers-stagneert.html |title=Daling aantal vuurwerkslachtoffers stagneert |author=Hugo van der Parre &amp; Rinke van den Brink |work=NOS |date=3 January 2017 |accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Flint Adolescent Study''' (FAS) is a longitudinal interview study of risk and promotive factors associated with alcohol, tobacco and other drug use across a lifetime.

The study is led by [[Marc A. Zimmerman, Ph.D.]], Director of the [http://prc.sph.umich.edu/ Prevention Research Center] and the [http://yvpc.sph.umich.edu/ Michigan Youth Violence Prevention Center] at the [[University of Michigan School of Public Health]]. Hsing-Fang Hsieh, PhD, Research Investigator at the UM School of Public Health is the Project Director. Data is collected by the Michigan Public Health Institute.

The Flint Adolescent Study and Flint Adolescent Study-Generation 2 are funded by the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]].

==Original Study (FAS Generation 1)==
In 1994, a cohort of 850 youth was recruited from the [[Flint Community Schools]]. A sample of predominantly African American youth was followed for 4 years in high school (1994-1998), 4 years after high school as they experienced the transition to young adulthood (1999-2003), and another 4 years during their late twenties as they experienced middle adult transition (2008-2012).

===Goals===
The original goal of the study was to explore the promotive factors associated with school dropout and alcohol, tobacco, and other drug (ATOD) use across their four high school years. Over the years, additional risk and promotive factors and health outcomes were explored including:

* participation in church, school and community organizations
* social support and influence of family and friends (including mentoring)
* self-esteem, stress and psychological well-being
* delinquent and violent behaviors; alcohol and substance abuse
* sex behaviors and child-bearing
* school attitudes and performance
* family structure and relationships
* driving behavior (beginning in Years 3 &amp; 4)
* racial identity (beginning in Year 3)
* marriage, parenting, and post-secondary education (beginning in Year 5)

==FAS Generation 2==
Now in their 30’s, FAS participants are parents to over 400 children aged 5–16 years old. The Flint Adolescent Study – Generation 2 expands on the scope of the original study to explore how parenting factors are associated with children’s alcohol and drug use and other risk factors.

The specific aim of FAS Gen 2 is to understand the inter-generational transmission of risk for ATOD use the original FAS sample.

Applying a socio-ecological developmental framework with a resiliency perspective, family, neighborhood environments, and past and current behaviors are being studied, along with the attitudes and experiences of parents and how they influence their parenting attitudes and behaviors over time. The study is also examining how these factors may influence substance use in their children (G2).

===Specific aims===
* To examine how individual and family factors measured across adolescence and young adulthood predict G1’s parenting attitudes and behaviors.
* To identify which G1 parenting attitudes and behaviors predict G2 ATOD use antecedents (both risk and promotive factors) and subsequent ATOD use (or nonuse).
* To test a social ecological model that incorporates the findings from Aims 1-2 into a comprehensive model testing both longitudinal influences and structural paths.
* To determine the extent to which Aims 1-2 are influenced by neighborhood characteristics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5616">Developed in Sweden, the '''Greenfish recirculation technology''' is a [[water purification]] technology for sustainable [[aquaculture]] production in closed indoor freshwater systems. It was developed at [[Gothenburg University]] by [[Björn Lindén]] in collaboration with Chalmers associate professor [http://www.chalmers.se/s2/SV/kontakt/personal/wik-torsten Torsten Wik], under the supervision of professor emeritus [[Gustaf Olsson]] at [[Lund University]] of Technology.

'''Groundwater pollution''' (also called '''groundwater contamination''') occurs when pollutants are released to the ground and make their way down into [[groundwater]]. This type of [[water pollution]] can also occur naturally due to the presence of a minor and unwanted constituent, contaminant or impurity in the groundwater, in which case it is more likely referred to as [[contamination]] rather than [[pollution]].

The pollutant often creates a contaminant [[Plume (fluid dynamics)|plume]] within an [[aquifer]]. Movement of water and dispersion within the aquifer spreads the pollutant over a wider area. Its advancing boundary, often called a plume edge, can intersect with [[Water well|groundwater wells]] or daylight into surface water such as seeps and springs, making the water supplies unsafe for humans and wildlife. The movement of the plume, called a plume front, may be analyzed through a [[hydrological transport model]] or [[groundwater model]]. Analysis of groundwater pollution may focus on [[soil]] characteristics and site geology, [[hydrogeology]], [[hydrology]], and the nature of the contaminants.

Pollution can occur from on-site [[sanitation]] systems, [[landfill]]s, effluent from [[wastewater treatment plants]], leaking sewers, petrol [[filling station]]s or from over application of [[fertilizer]]s in [[agriculture]]. Pollution (or contamination) can also occur from naturally occurring contaminants, such as [[arsenic contamination of groundwater|arsenic]] or [[fluoride]]. Using polluted groundwater causes hazards to public health through poisoning or the spread of disease.

Different mechanisms have influence on the transport of pollutants, e.g. [[diffusion]], [[adsorption]], [[precipitation]], [[decomposition|decay]], in the groundwater. The interaction of groundwater contamination with surface waters is analyzed by use of hydrology transport models.

== Pollutant types ==
Contaminants found in groundwater cover a broad range of physical, inorganic chemical, organic chemical, bacteriological, and radioactive parameters. Principally, many of the same pollutants that play a role in surface [[water pollution]] may also be found in polluted groundwater, although their respective importance may differ.

=== Arsenic and fluoride ===
{{Main article|Arsenic contamination of groundwater}}
Arsenic and fluoride have been recognized by the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]] as the most serious inorganic contaminants in drinking-water on a worldwide basis.&lt;ref name="WHO2006"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/PGWsection1.pdf|chapter=Section 1:Managing the Quality of Drinking-water Sources|last=World Health Organization (WHO)|first=|title=Protecting Groundwater for Health: Managing the Quality of Drinking-water
|editor1-last=Schmoll, O|editor2-last=Howard, G|editor3-last=Chilton G |date=2006|publisher=IWA Publishing for WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[metalloid]] arsenic can occur naturally in groundwater, as seen most frequently in Asia, including in China, India and Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://users.physics.harvard.edu/~wilson/arsenic/references/Ravenscroft_Prediction.pdf|title=Predicting the global extent of arsenic pollution of groundwater and its potential impact on human health|last=Ravenscroft, P|date=2007|publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Ganges Plain]] of [[northern India]] and [[Bangladesh]] severe [[Arsenic contamination of groundwater|contamination of groundwater by naturally occurring arsenic]] affects 25% of [[Water well|water wells]] in the shallower of two regional aquifers.

Arsenic in groundwater can also be present where there are [[mining]] operations or [[Tailings|mine waste dumps]] that will leach arsenic.

Natural [[fluoride]] in groundwater is of growing concern as deeper groundwater is being used, "with more than 200 million people at risk of [[drinking water]] with elevated concentrations."&lt;ref name="ICUN"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Smith, M|editor2-last=Cross, K|editor3-last=Paden, M|editor4-last=Laben, P|title=Spring - managing groundwater sustainably|date=2016|publisher=IUCN|isbn=978-2-8317-1789-0|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2016-039.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluoride can especially be released from acidic volcanic rocks and dispersed volcanic ash when water [[Hard water|hardness]] is low. High levels of fluoride in groundwater is a serious problem in the [[Pampas|Argentinean Pampas]], [[Chile]], [[Mexico]], India, [[Pakistan]], the [[East African Rift]], and some volcanic islands ([[Tenerife]])&lt;ref name="GEF"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.groundwatergovernance.org/fileadmin/user_upload/groundwatergovernance/docs/Thematic_papers/GWG_Thematic_Paper_1.pdf|title=Trends in groundwater pollution: Loss of groundwater quality &amp; related services - Groundwater Governance|publisher=Global Environmental Facility (GEF)|editor-last=Custodio, E|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas that have naturally occurring high levels of [[fluoride]] in groundwater which is used for drinking water, both [[dental fluorosis|dental]] and [[skeletal fluorosis]] can be prevalent and severe.&lt;ref name="WHOfluoride"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fawell, J|last2=Bailey, K|last3=Chilton, J|last4=Dahi, E|title=Fluoride in drinking-water|date=2006|publisher=IWA for WHO|location=Geneva|isbn=9241563192|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/fluoride_drinking_water_full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pathogens ===
[[File:Groundwater Contamination SW Asia Sm.png|thumb|[[Waterborne diseases]] can be spread via a groundwater well which is contaminated with fecal pathogens from [[pit latrine]]s]]

The lack of proper sanitation measures, as well as improperly placed [[Water well|wells]], can lead to drinking water contaminated with [[pathogens]] carried in [[feces]] and [[urine]]. Such [[fecal-oral transmission|fecal-oral transmitted]] diseases include [[cholera]] and [[diarrhea]].&lt;ref name="Wolf2015"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2155|title=How to keep your groundwater drinkable: Safer siting of sanitation systems|last1=Wolf, L|last2=Nick, A|last3=Cronin, A|date=2015|publisher=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance Working Group 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolf2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolf, J|last2=Prüss-Ustün, A|last3=Cumming, O|last4=Bartram, J|display-authors=3|date=2014|title=Systematic review: Assessing the impact of drinking water and sanitation on diarrhoeal disease in low- and middle-income settings: systematic review and meta-regression|journal=Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health|volume=19|issue=8|pages=928–942|doi=10.1111/tmi.12331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the four [[pathogen]] types that are present in feces ([[bacteria]], [[viruses]], [[protozoa]], and [[helminth]]s or helminth eggs), the first three can be commonly found in polluted groundwater, whereas the relatively large helminth eggs are usually filtered out by the soil matrix.

Deep, confined aquifers are usually considered the safest source of drinking water with respect to pathogens. Pathogens from treated or untreated wastewater can contaminate certain, especially shallow, aquifers.&lt;ref name="Bacteria and Their Effects on Ground-Water Quality"&gt;United States Geological Survey (USGS), Michigan.

[https://pubs.usgs.gov/wri/wri01-4216/wrir-01-4216.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nitrate ===
Nitrate is the most common chemical contaminant in the world’s groundwater and aquifers.&lt;ref name="UNEP"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Ross, N|title=Clearing the waters a focus on water quality solutions|date=2010|publisher=UNEP|location=Nairobi, Kenya|isbn=978-92-807-3074-6|url=http://www.cep.unep.org/meetings/documents/19fa8807cd439e60dc1125fdea9f6ca1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some low-income countries nitrate levels in groundwater are extremely high, causing significant health problems. It is also stable (it does not degrade) under high oxygen conditions.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt;

Nitrate levels above 10&amp;nbsp;mg/L (10 ppm) in groundwater can cause "[[blue baby syndrome]]" (acquired [[methemoglobinemia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2000|title=Blue Babies and Nitrate-Contaminated Well Water|journal=Environ. Health Perspect.|volume=108|issue=7|pages=675–8|doi=10.1289/ehp.00108675|pmc=1638204|pmid=10903623|author1=Knobeloch, L|author2= Salna, B|author3=Hogan, A|author4=Postle, J|author5=Anderson, H}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drinking water quality standards]] in the European Union stipulate less than 50&amp;nbsp;mg/L for nitrate in [[drinking water]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

However, the linkages between nitrates in drinking water and blue baby syndrome have been disputed in other studies.&lt;ref name=Fewtrell&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fewtrell, L|title=Drinking-Water Nitrate, Methemoglobinemia, and Global Burden of Disease: A Discussion|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=2004|volume=112|issue=14|pages=1371–1374|doi=10.1289/ehp.7216|pmid=15471727|pmc=1247562}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vanGrinsven"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = van Grinsven, HJM|last2 = Ward, MH|volume = 5|issue = 1|pages = 26|doi = 10.1186/1476-069X-5-26|title = Does the evidence about health risks associated with nitrate ingestion warrant an increase of the nitrate standard for drinking water?|pmid=16989661|pmc=1586190|year=2006|journal=Environ Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; The syndrome outbreaks might be due to other factors than elevated nitrate concentrations in drinking water.&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ward, MH|last2=deKok, TM.|last3=Levallois, P|last4=Brender, J|display-authors=3|title=Workgroup Report: Drinking-Water Nitrate and Health—Recent Findings and Research Needs|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=2005|volume=113|issue=11|pages=1607–1614|doi=10.1289/ehp.8043|pmid=16263519|pmc=1310926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elevated nitrate levels in groundwater can be caused by on-site sanitation, sewage sludge disposal and agricultural activities.&lt;ref name="AGW"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.agw-net.org/resources/docs/Literature/GW_RBO_Training_Manual/English_version/08_Training_Manual_en.pdf|title=Integration of Groundwater Management into Transboundary Basin Organizations in Africa: Groundwater Hazards - a Training Manual by AGW-Net, BGR, IWMI, CapNet, ANBO, &amp; IGRAC.|last=AGW-Net|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can therefore have an urban or agricultural origin.&lt;ref name="GEF" /&gt;

=== Organic compounds ===
{{Main article|VOC contamination of groundwater}}
[[Volatile organic compound|Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)]] are a dangerous contaminant of groundwater. They are generally introduced to the environment through careless industrial practices. Many of these compounds were not known to be harmful until the late 1960s and it was some time before regular testing of groundwater identified these substances in drinking water sources.

Primary VOC pollutants found in groundwater include [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s such as BTEX compounds ( [[benzene]], [[toluene]], [[ethylbenzene]] and [[xylene]]s), and chlorinated solvents including [[Tetrachloroethylene|tetrachloroethylene (PCE)]], [[Trichloroethylene|trichloroethylene (TCE)]], and [[Vinyl chloride|vinyl chloride (VC)]]. BTEX are important components of [[gasoline]]. PCE and TCE are industrial solvents historically used in [[dry cleaning]] processes and as a metal degreaser, respectively.

Other organic pollutants present in groundwater and derived from industrial operations are the [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)]]. Due to its molecular weight, [[Naphthalene]] is the most soluble and mobile PAH found in groundwater, whereas [[benzo(a)pyrene]] is the most toxic one. PAHs are generally produced as byproducts by incomplete combustion of organic matter.

Organic pollutants can also be found in groundwater as [[insecticides]] and [[herbicides]]. As many other synthetic organic compounds, most pesticides have very complex molecular structures. This complexity determines the water solubility, adsorption capacity, and mobility of pesticides in the groundwater system. Thus, some types of [[pesticide|pesticides]] are more mobile than others so they can more easily reach a drinking-water source.&lt;ref name="ICUN" /&gt;

=== Metals ===
Several trace metals occur naturally in certain rock formations and can enter in the environment from natural processes such as weathering. However, industrial activities such as [[mining]], [[metallurgy]], [[solid waste]] disposal, paint and enamel works, etc. can lead to elevated concentrations of toxic metals including [[lead]], [[cadmium]] and [[chromium]]. These contaminants have the potential to make their way into groundwater.&lt;ref name="AGW" /&gt;. 

The migration of metals (and metalloids) in groundwater will be affected by several factors, in particular by chemical reactions which determine the partitioning of contaminants among different phases and species. Thus, the mobility of metals primarily depends on the [[pH]] and [[redox]] state of groundwater.&lt;ref name="ICUN" /&gt;

=== Pharmaceuticals ===
Trace amounts of pharmaceuticals from treated wastewater infiltrating into the aquifer are among emerging ground-water contaminants being studied throughout the United States. Popular pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, antidepressants, decongestants,
tranquilizers, etc. are normally found in treated wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;[https://static.azdeq.gov/wqd/apec_emerging_cont_final.pdf: ''Emerging Contaminants In Arizona Water,'' Sep. 2016, pg 4.3.1]&lt;/ref&gt; This wastewater is discharged from the treatment facility, and often makes its way into the aquifer or source of surface water used for drinking water.

Trace amounts of pharmaceuticals in both groundwater and surface water are far below what is considered dangerous or of concern in most areas, but it could be an increasing problem as population grows and more reclaimed wastewater is utilized for municipal water supplies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://static.azdeq.gov/wqd/apec_emerging_cont_final.pdf: ''Emerging Contaminants In Arizona Water,'' Sep. 2016, pg 4.3.1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2006/1297/OFR2006-1297.pdf: ''Occurrence of Pharmaceuticals in Shallow Ground Water of Suffolk County, New York,'' Sep. 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===
Other organic pollutants include a range of [[organohalide]]s and other chemical compounds, [[petroleum]] hydrocarbons, various chemical compounds found in personal hygiene and [[cosmetics|cosmetic]] products, drug pollution involving [[pharmaceutical drug]]s and their metabolites. Inorganic pollutants might include other nutrients such as [[ammonia]] and [[phosphate]], and [[radionuclide]]s such as [[Uranium|uranium (U)]] or [[Radon|radon (Rn)]] naturally present in some geological formations. [[Saltwater intrusion]] is also an example of natural contamination, but is very often intensified by human activities.

Groundwater pollution is a worldwide issue. A study of the groundwater quality of the principal aquifers of the United States conducted between 1991 and 2004, showed that 23% of domestic wells had contaminants at levels greater than human-health benchmarks.&lt;ref name="USGS2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeSimone, LA|last2=Hamilton, PA|last3=Gilliom, RJ|title=Quality of water from domestic wells in principal aquifers of the United States, 1991-2004 : overview of major findings|date=2009|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|location=Reston, Va.|isbn=9781411323506|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/circ1332/includes/circ1332.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study suggested that the major groundwater pollution problems in Africa, considering the order of importance are: (1) nitrate pollution, (2) pathogenic agents, (3) organic pollution, (4) salinization, and (5) acid mine drainage.&lt;ref name="Xu2006"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Xu, Y|editor2-last=Usher, B|title=Groundwater pollution in Africa|date=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0-415-41167-X|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Siep_Talma2/publication/292226330_Nitrate_pollution_of_groundwater_in_southern_Africa/links/56ae51f108ae28588c61bc98.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
Causes of groundwater pollution include:
* Naturally-occurring (geogenic)
* On-site sanitation systems
* Sewage (treated and untreated)
* Fertilizers and pesticides
* Commercial and industrial leaks
* Hydraulic fracturing
* Landfill leachate
* Other

=== Naturally-occurring (geogenic) ===
“Geogenic” refers to naturally occurring as a result from geological processes.

The natural arsenic pollution occurs because aquifer sediments contain organic matter that generates [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] conditions in the aquifer. These conditions result in the microbial dissolution of [[iron oxide]]s in the sediment and, thus, the release of the [[arsenic]], normally strongly bound to iron oxides, into the water. As a consequence, arsenic-rich groundwater is often iron-rich, although secondary processes often obscure the association of dissolved arsenic and dissolved iron.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Arsenic is found in groundwater most commonly as the reduced species [[arsenite]] and the oxidized species arsenate, being the acute toxicity of arsenite somewhat greater than that of arsenate.&lt;ref name="EAWAG2015"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.eawag.ch/fileadmin/Domain1/Forschung/Menschen/Trinkwasser/Wrq/Handbook/geogenic-contamination-handbook.pdf|title=Geogenic Contamination Handbook - Addressing Arsenic and Fluoride in Drinking Water|last=EAWAG|editor1-last=Johnson, CA|editor2-last=Brezler, A|publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (EAWAG)|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations by WHO indicated that 20% of 25,000 boreholes tested in Bangladesh had arsenic concentrations exceeding 50 μg/l.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt;

The occurrence of fluoride is close related to the abundance and solubility of fluoride-containing minerals such as [[Fluorite|fluorite (CaF2)]].&lt;ref name="EAWAG2015" /&gt; Considerably high concentrations of fluoride in groundwater are typically caused by a lack of calcium in the aquifer.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt; Health problems associated with [[dental fluorosis]] may occur when fluoride concentrations in groundwater exceed 1.5&amp;nbsp;mg/l, which is the WHO guideline value since 1984.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt;

The [[Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology|Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (EAWAG)]] has recently developed the interactive Groundwater Assessment Platform (GAP), where the geogenic risk of contamination in a given area can be estimated using geological, topographical and other environmental data without having to test samples from every single groundwater resource. This tool also allows the user to produce probability risk mapping for both arsenic and fluoride.&lt;ref name="GAPMaps"&gt;{{cite web|title=Groundwater Assessment Platform|url=http://www.gapmaps.org|website=GAP Maps|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High concentrations of parameters like salinity, iron, manganese, uranium, radon and chromium, in groundwater, may also be of geogenic origin. This contaminants can be important locally but they are not as widespread as arsenic and fluoride.&lt;ref name="EAWAG2015" /&gt;

=== On-site sanitation systems ===
[[File:Shallow water well in traditional house (4359799047).jpg|thumb|A traditional housing compound near Herat, Afghanistan, where a shallow water supply well (foreground) is in close proximity to the pit latrine (behind the white greenhouse) leading to contamination of the groundwater.]]
Groundwater pollution with pathogens and nitrate can also occur from the liquids infiltrating into the ground from on-site [[sanitation]] systems such as [[pit latrine]]s and [[septic tank]]s, depending on the population density and the hydrogeological conditions.&lt;ref name="Wolf2015" /&gt;

Factors controlling the fate and transport of pathogens are quite complex and the interaction among them is not well understood.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt; If the local hydrogeological conditions (which can vary within a space of a few square kilometres) are ignored, simple on-site [[sanitation]] infrastructures such as pit latrines can cause significant public health risks via contaminated groundwater.

Liquids leach from the pit and pass the unsaturated soil zone (which is not completely filled with water). Subsequently, these liquids from the pit enter the groundwater where they may lead to groundwater pollution. This is a problem if a nearby [[water well]] is used to supply groundwater for [[drinking water]] purposes. During the passage in the soil, pathogens can die off or be adsorbed significantly, mostly depending on the travel time between the pit and the well.&lt;ref&gt;DVGW (2006) [http://www.beuth.de/en/technical-rule/dvgw-w-101/92562980 Guidelines on drinking water protection areas – Part 1: Groundwater protection areas]. Bonn, Deutsche Vereinigung des Gas- und Wasserfaches e.V. Technical rule number W101:2006-06&lt;/ref&gt; Most, but not all pathogens die within 50 days of travel through the subsurface.&lt;ref&gt;Nick, A., Foppen, J. W., Kulabako, R., Lo, D., Samwel, M., Wagner, F., Wolf, L. (2012). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/98 Sustainable sanitation and groundwater protection – Factsheet of Working Group 11]. Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA)&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of pathogen removal strongly varies with soil type, aquifer type, distance and other environmental factors.&lt;ref name="Graham2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graham|first1=J.P.|last2=Polizzotto|first2=M.L.|title = Pit Latrines and Their Impacts on Groundwater Quality: A Systematic Review|journal = Environ. Health Perspect.|volume = 121|issue = 5|pages = 521–530|doi = 10.1289/ehp.1206028|year = 2013|pmid=23518813|pmc = 3673197}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the unsaturated zone becomes “washed” during extended periods of heavy rain, providing hydraulic pathway for the quick pass of pathogens.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt; It is difficult to estimate the safe distance between a pit latrine or a septic tank and a water source. In any case, such recommendations about the safe distance are mostly ignored by those building pit latrines. In addition, household plots are of a limited size and therefore pit latrines are often built much closer to groundwater wells than what can be regarded as safe. This results in groundwater pollution and household members falling sick when using this groundwater as a source of drinking water.

=== Sewage (treated and untreated) ===
Groundwater pollution can be caused by untreated waste discharge leading to diseases like skin lesions, bloody diarrhea and dermatitis. This is more common in locations having limited wastewater treatment infrastructure, or where there are systematic failures of the on-site sewage disposal system.&lt;ref name="Graham2013" /&gt; Along with pathogens and nutrients, untreated sewage can also have an important load of heavy metals that may seep into the groundwater system.

The treated effluent from [[sewage treatment plant]]s may also reach the aquifer if the effluent is infiltrated or discharged to local surface water bodies. Therefore, those substances that are not removed in conventional sewage treatment plants may reach the groundwater as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Philips|first1=P.J.|last2=Chalmers|first2=A.T.|last3=Gray|first3=J.L.|last4=Kolpin|first4=D.W.|last5=Foreman|first5=W.T.|last6=Wall|first6=G.R.|title=2012. Combined Sewer Overflows: An Environmental Source of Hormones and Wastewater Micropollutants|journal=Environmental Science and Technology|pmc=3352270|pmid=22540536|doi=10.1021/es3001294|volume=46|issue=10|pages=5336–43|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, detected concentrations of pharmaceutical residues in groundwater were in the order of 50&amp;nbsp;ng/L in several locations in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winker, M|title=Pharmaceutical residues in urine and potential risks related to usage as fertiliser in agriculture|date=2009|publisher=PhD thesis, Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH), Hamburg, Germany|location=Hamburg|isbn=978-3-930400-41-6|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because in conventional sewage treatment plants, micro-pollutants such as [[hormones]], [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] residues and other micro-pollutants contained in [[urine]] and [[feces]] are only partially removed and the remainder is discharged into surface water, from where it may also reach the groundwater.

Groundwater pollution can also occur from leaking sewers which has been observed for example in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/1-4020-5175-1|title=Urban Groundwater Management and Sustainability|volume=74|date=2006|publisher=Springer Link, NATO Science Series Volume 74 2006|isbn=978-1-4020-5175-3|pages=490|author1=Tellam, JH|author2=Rivett, MO|author3=Israfilov, RG|author4=Herringshaw, LG|doi=10.1007/1-4020-5175-1|series=NATO Science Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can also lead to potential cross-contamination of drinking-water supplies.&lt;ref name="UNWATER2015" /&gt;

Spreading wastewater or sewage sludge in agriculture may also be included as sources of faecal contamination in groundwater.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt;

=== Fertilizers and pesticides ===
Nitrate can also enter the groundwater via excessive use of fertilizers, including [[manure]] spreading. This is because only a fraction of the nitrogen-based fertilizers is converted to produce and other plant matter. The remainder accumulates in the soil or lost as run-off.&lt;ref name="Khan2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khan, MN|last2=Mohammad, F|editor1-last=Ansari, AA|editor2-last=Gill, SS|title=Eutrophication: Causes, Consequences and Control|date=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-7813-9|chapter=Eutrophication: Challenges and Solutions}}&lt;/ref&gt; High application rates of nitrogen-containing fertilizers combined with the high water-solubility of nitrate leads to increased [[Surface runoff#Agricultural issues|runoff]] into [[surface water]] as well as [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] into groundwater, thereby causing groundwater pollution.&lt;ref name="singh1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singh, B|last2=Singh, Y|last3=Sekhon, GS|title=Fertilizer-N use efficiency and nitrate pollution of groundwater in developing countries|journal=Journal of Contaminant Hydrology|date=1995|volume=20|issue=3–4|pages=167–184|doi=10.1016/0169-7722(95)00067-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excessive use of nitrogen-containing fertilizers (be they synthetic or natural) is particularly damaging, as much of the nitrogen that is not taken up by plants is transformed into nitrate which is easily leached.&lt;ref name="jackson2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson, LE|last2=Burger, M|last3=Cavagnaro, TR|title=Roots, Nitrogen Transformations, and Ecosystem Services|journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology|date=2008|volume=59|issue=1|pages=341–363|doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.59.032607.092932}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Manure spreading - geograph.org.uk - 1241415.jpg|thumb|Poor management practices in manure spreading can introduce both pathogens and nutrients (nitrate) in the groundwater system.]]
The nutrients, especially nitrates, in fertilizers can cause problems for natural habitats and for human health if they are washed off soil into watercourses or leached through soil into groundwater. The heavy use of nitrogenous fertilizers in cropping systems is the largest contributor to anthropogenic nitrogen in groundwater worldwide.&lt;ref name="suthar2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suthar, S|last2=Bishnoi, P|last3=Singh, S|last4=Mutiyar, PK|display-authors=3|title=Nitrate contamination in groundwater of some rural areas of Rajasthan, India|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|date=2009|volume=171|issue=1–3|pages=189–199|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.05.111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)]] and the [[European Commission]] are seriously dealing with the nitrate problem related to agricultural development, as a major water supply problem that requires appropriate management and governance.&lt;ref name="GEF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EU directive |serial=91/676/EEC|year=1991|description=concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources|date=12 December 1991|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Runoff of pesticides may leach into groundwater causing human health problems from contaminated water wells.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt; Pesticide concentrations found in groundwater are typically low, and often the regulatory human health-based limits exceeded are also very low.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt; The organophosphorus insecticide [[Monocrotophos|monocrotophos (MCP)]] appears to be one of a few hazardous, persistent, soluble and mobile (it does not bind with minerals in soils) pesticides able to reach a drinking-water source.&lt;ref name="PPDB"&gt;{{cite web|title=PPDB: Pesticide Properties DataBase|url=http://sitem.herts.ac.uk/aeru/ppdb/en/|website=University of Hertfordshire|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, more pesticide compounds are being detected as groundwater quality monitoring programs have become more extensive; however, much less monitoring has been conducted in developing countries due to the high analysis costs.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt;

=== Commercial and industrial leaks ===
A wide variety of both inorganic and organic pollutants have been found in aquifers underlying commercial and industrial activities.

Ore mining and metal processing facilities are the primary responsible of the presence of metals in groundwater of anthropogenic origin, including arsenic. The low pH associated with [[Acid mine drainage|acid mine drainage (AMD)]] contributes to the solubility of potential toxic metals that can eventually enter the groundwater system.
[[File:Benzene Transport to Groundwater from Oil Spill.pdf|thumb|Oil spills associated with underground pipelines and tanks can release benzene and other soluble petroleum hydrocarbons that rapidly percolate down into the aquifer.]]
There is an increasing concern over the groundwater pollution by gasoline leaked from petroleum [[Underground storage tank|underground storage tanks (USTs)]] of [[Filling station|gas stations]].&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt; BTEX compounds are the most common additives of the gasoline. BTEX compounds, including benzene, have densities lower than water (1 g/ml). Similar to the oil spills on the sea, the non-miscible phase, referred to as [[Light non-aqueous phase liquid|Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (LNAPL)]], will “float” upon the [[water table]] in the aquifer.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt;

Chlorinated solvents are used in nearly any industrial practice where degreasing removers are required.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt; [[Tetrachloroethylene|PCE]] is a highly utilized solvent in the dry cleaning industry because of its cleaning effectiveness and relatively low cost. It has also been used for metal-degreasing operations. Because it is highly volatile, it is more frequently found in groundwater than in surface water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/consult/_2014/tetrachloroethylene/draft-ebauche-eng.php|title=Tetrachloroethylene in Drinking Water|last=Health Canada|first=|date=2014|website=|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2017|reason=webpage is for a public consultation}} TCE has historically been used as a metal cleaning. The military facility [[Anniston Army Depot|Anniston Army Dept (ANAD)]] in the United States was placed on the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]] [[Superfund]] [[National Priorities List|National Priorities List (NPL)]] because of groundwater contamination with as much as 27 million pounds of TCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/hac/pha/AnnistonArmyDepot093008/Anniston%20Army%20Depot%20HC%20093008.pdf|title=Follow-up Health Consultation: Anniston Army Depot.|last=ATSDR (US Agency for Toxic Substance &amp; Disease Registry)|first=|date=2008|website=|access-date=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both PCE and TCE may degrade to [[Vinyl chloride|vinyl chloride (VC)]], the most toxic chlorinated hydrocarbon.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt;

Many types of solvents may have also been disposed illegally, leaking over time to the groundwater system.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt;

Chlorinated solvents such as PCE and TCE have densities higher than water and the non-miscible phase is referred to as [[Dense non-aqueous phase liquid|Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids (DNAPL)]].&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt; Once they reach the aquifer, they will "sink" and eventually accumulate on the top of low-permeability layers.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drycleancoalition.org/download/citizens_guide_drycleaner_cleanup.pdf|title=A Citizen's Guide to Drycleaner Cleanup|last=State Coalition for Remediation of Drycleaners|first=|date=2011|website=|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, wood-treating facilities have also release insecticides such as [[Pentachlorophenol|pentachlorophenol (PCP)]] and [[creosote]] into the environment, impacting the groundwater resources.&lt;ref name="atlanticwood"&gt;{{cite web|title=Superfund Site: Atlantic Wood Industries, Inc|url=https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0302836|website=US Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCP is a highly soluble and toxic obsolete pesticide recently listed in the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]]. PAHs and other semi-VOCs are the common contaminants associated with creosote.

Although non-miscible, both LNAPLs and DNAPLs still have the potential to slowly dissolve into the aqueous (miscible) phase to create a plume and thus become a long-term source of contamination. DNAPLs (chlorinated solvents, heavy PAHs, creosote, [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]]) tend to be difficult to manage as they can reside very deep in the groundwater system.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt;

=== Hydraulic fracturing ===
{{Further|Hydraulic fracturing}}
The recent growth of [[Hydraulic fracturing|Hydraulic Fracturing]] ("Fracking") wells in the United States has raised concerns regarding its potential risks of contaminating groundwater resources. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), along with many other researchers, has been delegated to study the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water resources. While it is possible to perform hydraulic fracturing without having a relevant impact on groundwater resources if stringent controls and quality management measures are in place, there are a number of cases where groundwater pollution due to improper handling or technical failures was observed.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

While the EPA has not found significant evidence of a widespread, systematic [[Environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing#Water contamination|impact on drinking water by hydraulic fracturing]], this may be due to insufficient systematic pre- and post- hydraulic fracturing data on drinking water quality, and the presence of other agents of [[contamination]] that preclude the link between [[shale oil]]/gas extraction and its impact.&lt;ref name="EPAfracking"&gt;{{cite book|last1=EPA|title=Hydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas: Impacts from the Hydraulic Fracturing Water Cycle on Drinking Water Resources in the United States (Final Report).|date=2016|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|url=https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/hfstudy/recordisplay.cfm?deid=332990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the EPA's lack of profound widespread evidence, other researchers have made significant observations of rising groundwater contamination in close proximity to major shale oil/gas drilling sites located in [[Marcellus natural gas trend|Marcellus]]&lt;ref name="digiulio"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DiGiulio, DC|last2=Jackson, RB|title=Impact to Underground Sources of Drinking Water and Domestic Wells from Production Well Stimulation and Completion Practices in the Pavillion, Wyoming, Field|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|date=2016|volume=50|issue=8|pages=4524–4536|doi=10.1021/acs.est.5b04970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ellsworth |first=William L. |date=2013-07-12 |title=Injection-Induced Earthquakes |journal=Science |volume=341 |number=6142 |doi=10.1126/science.1225942}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]). Within one kilometer of these specific sites, a subset of shallow drinking water consistently showed higher concentration levels of [[methane]], [[ethane]], and [[propane]] concentrations than normal. An evaluation of higher [[Helium]] and other noble gas concentration along with the rise of hydrocarbon levels supports the distinction between hydraulic fracturing fugitive gas and naturally occurring "background" [[hydrocarbon]] content. This contamination is speculated to be the result of leaky, failing, or improperly installed gas well casings.&lt;ref name="Vengosh"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vengosh|first=Avner|date=2014|title=A Critical Review of the Risks to Water Resources from  Unconventional Shale Gas Development and Hydraulic Fracturing in the United States|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|doi=10.1021/es405118y|pmid=|volume=48|issue=15|pages=8334–8348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, it is theorized that contamination could also result from the [[Capillary action|capillary migration]] of deep residual hyper-saline water and hydraulic fracturing fluid, slowly flowing through faults and fractures until finally making contact with [[Water resources|groundwater resources]];&lt;ref name="Vengosh" /&gt; however, many researchers argue that the permeability of rocks overlying shale formations are too low to allow this to ever happen sufficiently.&lt;ref name="Howarth"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Howarth, RW|last2=Ingraffea, A|last3=Engelder, T|title=Natural gas: Should fracking stop?|journal=Nature|date=2011|volume=477|issue=7364|pages=271–275|doi=10.1038/477271a}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ultimately prove this theory, there would have to be traces of toxic [[trihalomethane]]s (THM) since they are often associated with the presence of stray gas contamination, and typically co-occur with high halogen concentrations in hyper-saline waters.&lt;ref name="Howarth" /&gt; Besides, highly saline waters are a common natural feature in deep groundwater systems.

While conclusions regarding groundwater pollution as the result to hydraulic fracturing fluid flow is restricted in both space and time, researchers have hypothesized that the potential for systematic stray gas contamination depends mainly on the integrity of the shale oil/gas well structure, along with its relative geological location to local fracture systems that could potentially provide flow paths for fugitive gas migration.&lt;ref name="Vengosh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Howarth" /&gt;

Though widespread, systematic contamination by hydraulic fracturing has been heavily disputed, one major source of contamination that has the most consensus among researchers of being the most problematic is site-specific accidental spillage of [[Fracking fluid|hydraulic fracturing fluid]] and [[produced water]]. So far, a significant majority of groundwater contamination events are derived from surface-level [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] routes rather than the subsurface flow from underlying [[shale]] formations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drollette, BD|last2=Hoelzer, K|last3=Warner, NR.|last4=Darrah, TH|date=2015|title=Elevated levels of diesel range organic compounds in groundwater near Marcellus gas operations are derived from surface activities|display-authors=3|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=112|issue=43|pages=13184–13189|doi=10.1073/pnas.1511474112|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4629325|pmid=26460018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such events include: a fracking fluid spillage in Acorn Fork Creek, Kentucky that caused a widespread death among aquatic species in 2007;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewg.org/enviroblog/2013/09/fracking-fluids-spill-caused-kentucky-fish-kill-0|title=Fracking Fluids Spill Caused Kentucky Fish Kill|website=EWG|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 420,000 gallon spillage of hyper-saline produced water that turned a once very-fertile farmland in New Mexico into a dead-zone in 2010;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.claimsjournal.com/news/national/2015/09/09/265627.htm|title=Fracking Boom Linked to Increasing Wastewater Spills|date=2015-09-09|website=Claims Journal|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 42,000 gallon fracking fluid spillage in Arlington, Texas that necessitated an evacuation of over a 100 homes in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/usa/267838-arlington-texas-fracking-accident/|title=Texas fracking site that spilled 42,000 gallons of fluid into residential area hopes to reopen|website=RT International|language=en-EN|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the damage can be obvious, and much more effort is being done to prevent these accidents from occurring so frequently, the lack of data from fracking oil spills continue to leave researchers in the dark. In many of these events, the data acquired from the leakage or spillage is often very vague, and thus would lead researchers to lacking conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2016/01/22/lack-of-data-on-fracking-spills-leaves-researchers-in-the-dark-on-water-contamination/|title=Lack of data on fracking spills leaves researchers in the dark on water contamination|website=StateImpact Pennsylvania|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from the [[Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources|Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR)]] conducted a modelling study for a deep shale-gas formation in the North German Basin. They concluded that the probability is small that the rise of fracking fluids through the geological underground to the surface will impact shallow groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Houben, G|last3=Himmelsbach, T|date=2016|title=Numerical modeling of fracking fluid migration through fault zones and fractures in the North German Basin|journal=Hydrogeology Journal|volume=24|issue=6|pages=1343–1358|doi=10.1007/s10040-016-1418-7|last1=Pfunt, H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Landfill leachate ===
[[Leachate]] from sanitary [[landfill]]s can lead to groundwater pollution.

[[Love Canal]] was one of the most widely known examples of groundwater pollution. In 1978, residents of the Love Canal neighborhood in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] noticed high rates of [[cancer]] and an alarming number of [[birth defect]]s. This was eventually traced to [[VOC contamination of groundwater|organic solvents]] and [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] from an industrial landfill that the neighborhood had been built over and around, which had then infiltrated into the water supply and evaporated in basements to further contaminate the air. Eight hundred families were reimbursed for their homes and moved, after extensive legal battles and media coverage.

=== Other ===
Further causes of groundwater pollution are chemical spills from commercial or industrial operations, chemical spills occurring during transport (e.g. spillage of [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] fuels), [[illegal dumping|illegal waste dumping]], infiltration from [[urban runoff]] or [[mining]] operations, [[Sodium chloride|road salts]], [[De-ice|de-icing chemicals]] from airports and even [[Air pollution|atmospheric contaminants]] since groundwater is part of the [[hydrologic cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Potential Threats to Our Groundwater|url=http://www.groundwater.org/get-informed/groundwater/contamination.html|publisher=The Groundwater Foundation|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The burial of corpses and their subsequent degradation may also pose a risk of pollution to groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sepa.org.uk/media/143364/lups-gu32-guidance-on-assessing-the-impacts-of-cemetries-on-groundwater.pdf|title=Guidance on Assessing the Impacts of Cemeteries on Groundwater|last=Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA)|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms ==

The passage of water through the subsurface can provide a reliable natural barrier to contamination but it only works under favorable conditions.&lt;ref name="Wolf2015" /&gt;

The stratigraphy of the area plays an important role in the transport of pollutants. An area can have layers of sandy soil, fractured bedrock, clay, or hardpan. Areas of karst topography on limestone bedrock are sometimes vulnerable to surface pollution from groundwater. Earthquake faults can also be entry routes for downward contaminant entry. Water table conditions are of great importance for drinking water supplies, agricultural irrigation, waste disposal (including nuclear waste), wildlife habitat, and other ecological issues.&lt;ref&gt;Groundwater Sampling; http://www.groundwatersampling.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Many chemicals undergo reactive decay or chemical change, especially over long periods of time in [[groundwater]] reservoirs. A noteworthy class of such chemicals is the [[chlorinated hydrocarbons]] such as [[trichloroethylene]] (used in industrial metal degreasing and electronics manufacturing) and [[tetrachloroethylene]] used in the dry cleaning industry. Both of these chemicals, which are [[carcinogens]] themselves, undergo partial decomposition reactions, leading to new hazardous chemicals (including [[dichloroethylene]] and [[vinyl chloride]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=== Interactions with surface water ===
Although interrelated, [[surface water]] and groundwater have often been studied and managed as separate resources.&lt;ref name="circ1139"&gt;United States Geological Survey (USGS), Denver, CO (1998). [http://pubs.water.usgs.gov/circ1139/ "Ground Water and Surface Water: A Single Resource."] Circular 1139.&lt;/ref&gt; Surface water seeps through the soil and becomes groundwater. Conversely, groundwater can also feed surface water sources. Sources of surface water pollution are generally grouped into two categories based on their origin.

Interactions between [[groundwater]] and surface water are complex. Consequently, groundwater pollution, sometimes referred to as groundwater contamination, is not as easily classified as surface [[water pollution]].&lt;ref name="circ1139" /&gt; By its very nature, groundwater [[aquifer]]s are susceptible to contamination from sources that may not directly affect surface water bodies, and the distinction of point vs. non-point source may be irrelevant. 

A spill or ongoing release of chemical or [[radionuclide]] contaminants into soil (located away from a surface water body) may not create point or non-point source pollution but can contaminate the aquifer below, creating a toxic [[Plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]]. The movement of the plume, may be analyzed through a [[hydrological transport model]] or [[groundwater model]]. 

== Prevention ==
[[File:Safer siting of sanitation systems - schematic.jpg|thumb|Schematic showing that there is a lower risk of groundwater pollution with greater depth of the water well&lt;ref name="Wolf2015" /&gt;]]

=== Precautionary principle ===
{{Further|Precautionary principle}}The [[precautionary principle]], evolved from Principle 15 of the [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]], is important in protecting groundwater resources from pollution. The precautionary principle provides that “''where there are threats of irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation''.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/10737/GoodPracticesforRegulatingWastewater.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=Good Practices for Regulating Wastewater Treatment|last=United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)|first=|date=2015|website=|access-date=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the six basic principles of the [[European Union|European Union (EU)]] water policy is the application of the precautionary principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/protecting_groundwater_part5.pdf?ua=1|chapter=Section 5:Approaches to pollution source management|last1=World Health Organization (WHO)|title=Protecting Groundwater for Health: Managing the Quality of Drinking-water

=== Groundwater quality monitoring ===
Groundwater quality monitoring programs have been implemented regularly in many countries around the world. They are important components to understand the hydrogeological system, and for the development of conceptual models and aquifer vulnerability maps.&lt;ref name="WHO2006b" /&gt;

Groundwater quality must be regularly monitored across the aquifer to determine trends. Effective groundwater monitoring should be driven by a specific objective, for example, a specific contaminant of concern.&lt;ref name="ICUN" /&gt; Contaminant levels can be compared to the [[World Health Organization|World Health]] [[World Health Organization|Organization (WHO)]] guidelines for drinking-water quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44584/1/9789241548151_eng.pdf|title=Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality|last=World Health Organization (WHO)|first=|date=2011|website=|access-date=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not rare that limits of contaminants are reduced as more medical experience is gained.&lt;ref name="GEF" /&gt;

Sufficient investment should be given to continue monitoring over the long term. When a problem is found, action should be taken to correct it.&lt;ref name="ICUN" /&gt; Waterborne outbreaks in the United States decreased with the introduction of more stringent monitoring (and treatment) requirements in the early 90s.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt;

The community can also help monitor the groundwater quality.&lt;ref name="WHO2006b" /&gt;

=== Land zoning for groundwater protection ===
The development of land-use zoning maps has been implemented by several water authorities at different scales around the world. There are two types of zoning maps: aquifer vulnerability maps and source protection maps.&lt;ref name="ICUN" /&gt;

==== Aquifer vulnerability map ====
It refers to the intrinsic (or natural) vulnerability of a groundwater system to pollution.&lt;ref name="ICUN" /&gt; Intrinsically, some aquifers are more vulnerable to pollution than other aquifers.&lt;ref name="WHO2006b" /&gt; Shallow unconfined [[aquifer]]s are more at risk of pollution because there are fewer layers to filter out contaminants.&lt;ref name="ICUN" /&gt;

The [[Vadose zone|unsaturated zone]] can play an important role in retarding (and in some cases eliminating) pathogens and so must be considered when assessing aquifer vulnerability.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt; The biological activity is greatest in the top soil layers where the attenuation of pathogens is generally most effective.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt;

Preparation of the vulnerability maps typically involves overlaying several thematic maps of physical factors that have been selected to describe the aquifer vulnerability.&lt;ref name="WHO2006b" /&gt; The index-based parametric mapping method GOD developed by Foster and Hirata (1988) uses three generally available or readily estimated parameters, the degree of '''G'''roundwater hydraulic confinement, geological nature of the '''O'''verlying strata and '''D'''epth to groundwater.&lt;ref name="WHO2006b"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/PGWsection2.pdf?ua=1|title=Protecting Groundwater for Health - Understanding the drinking-water catchment|last=World Health Organization (WHO)|first=|date=2006|website=|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Groundwater Pollution Risk Assessment|last=Foster &amp; Hirata|first=|publisher=Pan American Centre for Sanitary Engineering and Environmental Sciences|year=1988|isbn=|location=Lima, Peru|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/913221468028147970/Groundwater-quality-protection-a-guide-for-water-utilities-municipal-authorities-and-environment-agencies|title=Groundwater quality protection : a guide for water utilities, municipal authorities, and environment agencies|last=Foster, S|last2=Hirata, H|last3=Gomes, D|last4=D'Elia, M|
date=2002| display-authors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further approach developed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]] named DRASTIC employs seven hydrogeological factors to develop an index of vulnerability: '''D'''epth to water table, net '''R'''echarge, '''A'''quifer media, '''S'''oil media, '''T'''opography (slope), '''I'''mpact on the [[vadose zone]], and [[Hydraulic conductivity|hydraulic '''C'''onductivity]].&lt;ref name="WHO2006b" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=DRASTIC: A Standardized System For Evaluating Groundwater Pollution Potential Using Hydrogeologic Settings|last1=Aller|first1=Linda|last2=Bennett|first2=Truman|last3=Lehr|first3=Jay H.|last4=Petty|first4=Rebecca J.|last5=Hackett|first5=Glen|publisher=US EPA|year=1987|url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/20007KU4.TXT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a particular debate among hydrogeologists as to whether aquifer vulnerability should be established in a general (intrinsic) way for all contaminants, or specifically for each pollutant.&lt;ref name="WHO2006b" /&gt;

==== Source protection map ====
It refers to the capture areas around an individual groundwater source, such as a water well or a spring, to especially protect them from pollution. Thus, potential sources of degradable pollutants, such as pathogens, can be located at distances which travel times along the flowpaths are long enough for the pollutant to be eliminated through filtration or adsorption.&lt;ref name="ICUN" /&gt;

Analytical methods using equations to define groundwater flow and contaminant transport are the most widely used.&lt;ref name="WHOb"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/PGWsection4.pdf?ua=1|chapter=Section 4: Approaches to drinking-water source protection management|title=Protecting groundwater for health: Managing the quality of drinking-water sources|last=World Health Organization (WHO)|editor1-last=Schmoll, I|editor2-last=Howard, G|publisher=IWA Publishing for WHO|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHPA is a semi-analytical groundwater flow simulation program developed by the US EPA for delineating capture zones in a wellhead protection area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/water-research/wellhead-protection-area-whpa-model|title=Wellhead Protection Area (WHPA) Model|last=US EPA|first=|date=|website=|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest form of zoning employs fixed-distance methods where activities are excluded within a uniformly applied specified distance around abstraction points.&lt;ref name="WHOb" /&gt;

=== Locating on-site sanitation systems ===
As the health effects of most toxic chemicals arise after prolonged exposure, risk to health from chemicals is generally lower than that from pathogens.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt; Thus, the quality of the source protection measures is an important component in controlling whether pathogens may be present in the final drinking-water.&lt;ref name="WHOb" /&gt;

On-site sanitation systems can be designed in such a way that groundwater pollution from these sanitation systems is prevented from occurring.&lt;ref name="Wolf2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nick, A., Foppen, J. W., Kulabako, R., Lo, D., Samwel, M., Wagner, F., Wolf, L. (2012).

* Horizontal distance between the drinking water source and the sanitation system
** Guideline values for horizontal separation distances between on-site sanitation systems and water sources vary widely (e.g. 15 to 100 m horizontal distance between [[pit latrine]] and [[Water well|groundwater wells]])&lt;ref name="Graham2013" /&gt;
* Vertical distance between drinking water well and sanitation system
* Aquifer type
* Groundwater flow direction
* Impermeable layers
* Slope and surface drainage
* Volume of leaking wastewater
* Superposition, i.e. the need to consider a larger planning area 
As a very general guideline it is recommended that the bottom of the pit should be at least 2 m above&amp;nbsp;groundwater&amp;nbsp;level, and a minimum horizontal distance of 30 m between a pit and a water source is normally recommended to limit exposure to microbial contamination.&lt;sup&gt;[1] &lt;/sup&gt;However, no general statement should be made regarding the minimum lateral separation distances required to prevent contamination of a well from a pit latrine.&lt;ref name="Wolf2015"/&gt; For example, even 50 m lateral separation distance might not be sufficient in a strongly [[karst]]ified system with a downgradient supply well or spring, while 10 m lateral separation distance is completely sufficient if there is a well developed clay cover layer and the annular space of the groundwater well is well sealed.

Institutional and legal issues are critical in determining the success or failure of groundwater protection policies and strategies.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt;[[File:Blaues Hinweisschild Wasserschutzgebiet.JPG|thumb|Sign near Mannheim, Germany indicating a zone as a dedicated "groundwater protection zone"]]

====United States====
In November 2006, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] published the Ground Water Rule in the United States Federal Register. The EPA was worried that the ground water system would be vulnerable to contamination from fecal matter. The point of the rule was to keep microbial pathogens out of public water sources.&lt;ref name="water.epa.gov"&gt;[http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/gwr/index.cfm Ground Water Rule (GWR) | Ground Water Rule | US EPA]. Water.epa.gov. Retrieved on 2011-06-09.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 Ground Water Rule was an amendment of the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act.

The ways to deal with groundwater pollution that has already occurred can be grouped into the following categories: containing the pollutants to prevent them from migrating further; removing the pollutants from the aquifer; remediating the aquifer by either immobilizing or detoxifying the contaminants while they are still in the aquifer (in-situ); treating the groundwater at its point of use; or abandoning the use of this aquifer's groundwater and finding an alternative source of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/Oc-Po/Pollution-of-Groundwater.html|website = Water Encyclopedia, Science and Issues|accessdate = 21 March 2015|title = Pollution of groundwater}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Management ==

=== Point-of-use treatment ===
{{Main article|Portable water purification}}
Portable water purification devices or "point-of-use" (POU) water treatment systems and field water disinfection techniques can be used to remove some forms of groundwater pollution prior to drinking, namely any fecal pollution. Many commercial portable water purification systems or chemical additives are available which can remove pathogens, chlorine, bad taste, odors, and heavy metals like lead and mercury.

Techniques include boiling, filtration, activated charcoal absorption, chemical disinfection, ultraviolet purification, ozone water disinfection, solar water disinfection, solar distillation, homemade water filters.

Arsenic removal filters (ARF) are dedicated technologies typically installed to remove arsenic. Many of these technologies require a capital investment and long-term maintenance. Filters in Bangladesh are usually abandoned by the users due to their high cost and complicated maintenance, which is also quite expensive.

===Groundwater remediation===
{{Main article|Groundwater remediation}}
Groundwater pollution is much more difficult to abate than surface pollution because groundwater can move great distances through unseen [[aquifer]]s. Non-porous aquifers such as [[clay]]s partially purify water of bacteria by simple filtration (adsorption and absorption), dilution, and, in some cases, chemical reactions and biological activity; however, in some cases, the pollutants merely transform to [[soil contaminant]]s. Groundwater that moves through open [[Fracture (geology)|fractures]] and [[caverns]] is not filtered and can be transported as easily as surface water. In fact, this can be aggravated by the human tendency to use natural [[sinkhole]]s as dumps in areas of [[karst topography]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Pollutants and contaminants can be removed from ground water by applying various techniques thereby making it safe for use. Ground water treatment (or remediation) techniques span biological, chemical, and physical treatment technologies. Most ground water treatment techniques utilize a combination of technologies. Some of the biological treatment techniques include [[bioaugmentation]], [[bioventing]], [[biosparging]], [[bioslurping]], and [[phytoremediation]]. Some chemical treatment techniques include ozone and oxygen gas injection, [[chemical precipitation]], [[Membrane technology|membrane separation]], [[ion exchange]], carbon absorption, aqueous chemical oxidation, and surfactant enhanced recovery. Some chemical techniques may be implemented using [[nanoremediation|nanomaterials]]. Physical treatment techniques include, but are not limited to, pump and treat, [[air sparging]], and dual phase extraction.

=== Abandonment ===
If treatment or remediation of the polluted groundwater is deemed to be too difficult or expensive then abandoning the use of this aquifer's groundwater and finding an alternative source of water is the only other option.

== Society and culture ==

=== Examples ===

==== Hinkley, U.S. ====
The town of Hinkley, California (U.S.), had [[Hinkley groundwater contamination|its groundwater contaminated]] with [[hexavalent chromium]] starting in 1952, resulting in a legal case against [[Pacific Gas &amp; Electric]] (PG&amp;E) and a multimillion-dollar settlement in 1996. The legal case was dramatized in the film ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]'', released in 2000.

==== Walkerton, Canada ====
In the year 2000, groundwater pollution occurred in the small town of Walkerton, Canada leading to seven deaths in what is known as the [[Walkerton E. coli outbreak|Walkerton ''E. Coli'' outbreak]]. The water supply which was drawn from [[groundwater]] became contaminated with the highly dangerous [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|O157:H7]] strain of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/walkerton-e-coli-outbreak-declared-over/article1041067/ "Walkerton E. coli outbreak declared over"]. Tracy McLaughlin, ''The Globe and Mail''.&lt;/ref&gt; This contamination was due to farm runoff into an adjacent [[water well]] that was vulnerable to groundwater pollution.

==== Lusaka, Zambia ====
The peri-urban areas of Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, have ground conditions which are strongly karstified and for this reason – together with the increasing population density in these peri-urban areas – pollution of water wells from pit latrines is a major public health threat there.&lt;ref name="water.epa.gov"/&gt;

'''[[HIV/AIDS]] in [[Argentina]]''' is considered a concentrated epidemic by 2012. The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the general population is less than 1% although in some groups this percentage is 6%, while in others there is a major incidence. Considering the whole country, 70% of cases are concentrated in the [[Provinces of Argentina|provinces]] of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], [[Córdoba Province (Argentina)|Córdoba]] and the [[Buenos Aires|Autonomous City of Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name=boletin&gt;{{cite web|author=Dirección de Sida y enfermedades de transmisión sexual|title=Boletín sobre el VIH-sida en la Argentina|url=http://msal.gob.ar/sida/pdf/boletines-inves-publi/boletin-12-10.pdf|accessdate=23 May 2013|work=Ministerio de Salud de la Nación|date=November 2010|language=Spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626034643/http://msal.gob.ar/sida/pdf/boletines-inves-publi/boletin-12-10.pdf|archivedate=26 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2012 AIDS Epidemiological Bulletin, Bureau of AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (DSyETS in Spanish) under the Ministry of Health of the Nation, 5,500 new HIV cases are reported in Argentina every year; 90% of them acquired the virus by having sex without a [[condom]].&lt;ref name=boletin2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Salud presenta Boletín Epidemiológico de Sida 2012|url=http://www.msal.gov.ar/prensa/index.php/noticias/noticias-de-la-semana/959-salud-presenta-boletin-epidemiologico-de-sida-2012|accessdate=24 May 2013|work=Información Pública y Comunicación.

Of these, only 47,000 are under treatment, 69% in the public service and the rest covered by private health insurance plans.&lt;ref name=boletin2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=reva&gt;{{cite web|author=Ministerio de Salud de la Nación|title=Información sobre el VIH/sida.

== Statistics ==
In 1982 the first patient with AIDS was reported in the country. Since that year the Ministry of Health keeps records of cases; until mid-2000, more than 17,000 patients (12,732 men, 3,074 women and 1,214 children under 15 years) were reported.

In 1987, it was reported the first case of a woman infected with HIV.&lt;ref name=inf&gt;{{cite web|title=Proyecto de informe de auditoría de gestión ambiental|url=http://www.agn.gov.ar/informes/informesPDF2010/2010_118.pdf|accessdate=23 May 2013|work=Ministerio de Salud.

'''Hayes Nance''' (August 14, 1893 - April 3, 1964) was an American [[orthodontist]] known for his contributions to topics related to mixed dentition. Nance is known for developing [[serial extraction]] in United States, as well as pioneering the development of the Nance Appliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Mahlon|title=Hayes N. Nance|journal=Angle Orthodontist|date=1964|url=http://www.angle.org/doi/pdf/10.1043/0003-3219%281964%29034%3C0327%3AHNN%3E2.0.CO%3B2|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Nance was born in 1893 in [[Jackson, Tennessee]],  the youngest of five children. After his mother died in 1908, Nance attended the [[Webb School of Knoxville]], Tennessee. During his childhood, he was involved in an accident while working in a [[copper mine]] in [[Miami, Florida]]{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}. While working, Hayes suffered a fall which led to several fractures including a spinal injury. He  married Julia Manning.

He attended Northwestern University Dental School in 1919 and practiced for a short time in Arizona. He then eventually moved to Denver and opened his own practice.

He retired in 1948. He married Florence Hays in 1956. He died in 1964 at his home in [[Pasadena, California]] due to a heart attack. Florence died in 1955 also due to a heart attack.

==Orthodontics==
Nance wrote a paper in 1947 titled ''Limitations of Orthodontic Treatment'' that was the culmination of his 17 years of orthodontia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ajodo.org/article/0096-6347(47)90051-3/abstract|title=The limitations of orthodontic treatment - American Journal of Orthodontics and Oral Surgery|website=www.ajodo.org|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nance  described the concept of "leeway space". This space is usually found in human teeth after the permanent premolars in each arch have erupted. It is about 3.5mm in mandibles and 2mm in the maxillary arch. The adult premolar teeth are smaller than their predecessors, primary first and second molars. Therefore, the space that is naturally created, is usually taken up by the movement of the permanent first molar moving mesially. Nance showed that the combined width of mandibular deciduous canines, first molar and second molar is on average 1.7mm greater than that of the permanent successors on one side. The maxillary arch occupies about 1mm on each quadrant. Nance developed the Nance Appliance, which is used to prevent upper first molars from moving forward after the maxillary first primary molar has been prematurely lost.

==Recognition==
* Diplomate of American Board of Orthodontics
* Charles H. Tweed Foundation - President, Honorary Member
* Southern California Component of Edward H. Angle Society of Orthodontia - President, Honorary Member 
* Albert H. Ketcham Memorial Award (1963)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2950">France's '''Infected blood scandal''' began in April 1991 when doctor and journalist {{Interlanguage link multi|Anne-Marie Casteret|fr}} published an article in the weekly magazine the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|L'Événement du jeudi|fr}}'' proving that the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Centre National de Transfusion Sanguine|fr|3=Établissement français du sang}}''{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} knowingly distributed blood products contaminated with [[HIV]] to [[haemophiliac]]s in 1984 and 1985.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/world/scandal-over-tainted-blood-widens-in-france.html|title=Scandal Over Tainted Blood Widens in France|last=Riding|first=Alan|date=1994-02-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-07-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 8, 1985, multi-national health care company [[Abbott Laboratories]] sought authorisation to sell equipment needed for blood testing. Response to the demand was delayed as the government was waiting for a rival French test to be released&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

In 1992, Anne-Marie Casteret published a book ''Blood scandal (L'affaire du sang)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Anne-Marie |last=Casteret|language=French|title=L'affaire du sang|publisher=Éditions La Découverte|location=Paris|year=1992|isbn=2707121150}}&lt;/ref&gt; which refuted the argument that nobody was aware in 1985 that the heating of blood made the virus inactive. The book included evidence that as early as 1983, researchers had put forth this assumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = L'affaire du sang | author = Anne-Marie Casteret | publisher = Editions La Découverte | year = 1992 | isbn = 2-7071-2115-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Le sang et le SIDA : une enquête critique sur l'affaire du sang contaminé et le scandale des transfusions sanguines | author = Jean Sanitas | publisher = L'Harmattan | year = 1994 | isbn = 2-7384-3085-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the former socialist Prime Minister [[Laurent Fabius]], former Social Affairs Minister [[Georgina Dufoix]] and former Health Minister [[Edmond Herve]] were charged with "manslaughter". The [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Justice of Republic]] found [[Edmond Herve]] guilty, and acquitted Fabius and Dufoix.

The Jordan Meningitis Foundation is a [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] [[Nonprofit organization]] which was established in 1995 in [[Amman]] - [[Jordan]].

==Foundation==
The Jordan Meningitis Foundation is the brainchild of the painter [[Sana Al Masri]], who lost her 17-year-old daughter “Sarab” to [[Meningitis]]. Her efforts, since then, along with volunteers, members, doctors, professionals and others, have been devoted to work towards the eradication of this disease.

==Goals and objectives==
===Disease control===
====''Awareness:''====
by holding lectures and distributing free pamphlets about Meningitis in Jordan.

====''Vaccine:''====
Vaccination is the only public health tool available to prevent the vast majority of HIB disease. There is no vaccine yet available against all strains of Meningitis. Research continues in many countries abroad to develop vaccines against the most common strains and to find better ways of controlling the disease. Over 40 countries have included HIB vaccines in their expanded programs of immunization.
In October 1998, the JMF received a grant, generously provided by the Embassy of [[Japan]] in Jordan, to purchase [[Hib vaccine]]. Through this grass-root grant, a first step was taken to establish a pilot project in East Amman with plans for expansion into a second rural area. The pilot project would protect approximately 10,000 children from the HIB disease.

====''Research:''====
Jordanian Meningitis Foundation supports research and studies which help in controlling the disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmf95.com/jmf/objectives/report.htm COST EFFECTIVENESS STUDY OF HIB VACCINATION FOR CHILDREN BELOW 5 YEARS IN JORDAN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909081955/http://www.jmf95.com/jmf/objectives/report.htm |date=2007-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caring for victims of meningitis===
* Financial aid for the  low income households to take care of disabled Meningitis victims. 
* Increase access to aid tools  and medication for disabled Meningitis victims. 
* Ensure specialized services to disabled Meningitis victims, both through institutions and through the community based on training. 
* Opportunities in education and training for lucky survivors of  Meningitis.

===Rehabilitation===
The JMF rehabilitation center has helped disabled children from meningitis to be promising cases after being regarded hopeless cases under the supervision of specialized physiotherapist, and with the aid of specialized equipment (donation from the Japanese Embassy), thus improving mobility for children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmf95.com/jmf/ourneed/JapanProject.htm THE REHABILITATION VENTER, A GRANT FROM THE EMBASSY OF JORDAN - AMMAN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091853/http://www.jmf95.com/jmf/ourneed/JapanProject.htm |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The rehabilitation program is pursuant to 4 days a week which runs by a [[pediatrician]], a [[Physical therapy|physical therapist]], a special needs assistant and a social worker.

JMF also runs monthly field trips to family homes, where by a physiotherapist, and the social worker, respectively, attend to physical therapy, and attend to health, sanitation, and general social and financial well being of the children and their surroundings.

==Background==
Born in Salak Utara, [[Sungai Siput]], [[Perak]] on 22 August 1888, Leong was the son of Leong Yew Teen, who was responsible in developing Salak Utara, Perak.

He went to [[Guangzhou|Canton]], [[China]], for his early education. At age 13, he came back to [[British Malaya|Malaya]] from China and studied in [[Anglo-Chinese School|Anglo-Chinese School Ipoh]] and [[St Xavier's Institution]], [[Penang]]. 1906, at age 16, he joined [[Tongmenghui|Tongmenghui Singapore]].

He went to the University of London in 1908, studying economics, sociology, political science and law. He graduated in 1912 with an [[Bachelor of Laws|LLB]].

==Legal career==
He was called to the bar in 1920 and served as an advocate and solicitor in the Federated Malay States (FMS) and was also a member of the FMS Bar Committee until his resignation in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiawind.com/forums/read.php?f=4&amp;i=4302&amp;t=4302]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Unititled notice, The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 20 July 1932, Page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
On 27 February 1949, [[Tan Cheng Lock|Tun Tan Cheng Lock]] founded the [[Malaysian Chinese Association|Malayan Chinese Association]] (MCA) along with Leong Yew Koh and [[H.S. Lee|Colonel H. S. Lee]]. He was the first Secretary-General of MCA.&lt;ref name="foundedMCA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.malaysiandigest.com/features/77922-malaysian-road-names-who-is-who.html|title=Malaysian Road Names: Who's Who?|date=18 June 2013|work=Malaysian Digest|accessdate=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed as the Yang Dipertua Negeri of Melaka on 31 August 1957, and served until 30 August 1959.

In 1959, he was appointed as Justice Minister of Malaya. He died on 12 January 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.arkib.gov.my/hids/print.php?type=A&amp;item_id=5422|title=Tun Leong Yew Koh Meninggal Dunia|date=2011-11-14|accessdate=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the first Chinese to be appointed as the Yang di-Pertua Negeri in any of the Malaysian States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.is/u04x6|title=First Malacca Governor is Leong Yew Koh.

'''Limingen''' ({{lang-sma|Lyjmede}}) is a [[lake]] in the municipalities of [[Røyrvik]] and [[Lierne]] in [[Trøndelag]] county, [[Norway]]. It is the [[Lakes in Norway#Largest lakes|eighth-largest]] lake in the country.  The lake lies {{convert|418|m}} above sea level and has an area of {{convert|93|km2}}. At the deepest point, it is {{convert|192|m}} deep and averages about {{convert|87|m}} deep. The lake has a volume of {{convert|8.34|km3}} and is located just north of the large lake [[Tunnsjøen]].  The border with [[Sweden]] lies about {{convert|725|m|mi|1}} east of the lake.

The lake level is regulated by [[dam]]s.  The [[Røyrvikelva]] river flows into the north end of Limingen from the lake [[Vektaren]], through a dam. The water flows out through a tunnel to [[Røyrvikfoss Power Station]], at the village of [[Røyrvik (village)|Røyrvik]]. At the south end, near the village of Limingen in [[Lierne]], the water flows out of the tunnel to the [[Tunnsjøen]] via the [[Tunnsjø Power Station]], as well as to [[Linvasselv Power Station]] on the [[Sweden|Swedish]] side. The water level varies by up to about {{convert|10|m}} in level.&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snl.no/Limingen|title=Limingen|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multiple morbidities''' or '''Multimorbidities''' means co-occurring [[disease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Valderas JM, Starfield B, Sibbald B, Salisbury C, Roland M. Defining comorbidity: implications for understanding health and health services. Ann Fam Med. 2009 Jul-Aug;7(4):357-63.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a person could have [[diabetes]] and [[heart disease]] and [[high blood pressure]].  In the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] population, 65% of patients have two or more [[chronic illness]]es.&lt;ref name=Wolff&gt;Wolff JL, Starfield B, Anderson G.  [[Prevalence]], [[expenditures]], and complications of multiple [[chronic conditions]] in the elderly.  Arch Intern Med. 2002 Nov 11;162(20):2269-76.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the difficulties experienced by patients include: poor coordination of [[medical care]], managing multiple [[medication]]s, increases in their time spent managing illness,&lt;ref&gt;Jowsey, T., McRae, I. S., Valderas, J. M., Dugdale, P., Phillips, R., Bunton, R., ... &amp; Yen, L. (2013). Time’s up. Descriptive epidemiology of multi-morbidity and time spent on health related activity by older Australians: A time use survey. PLOS One, 8(4), e59379.&lt;/ref&gt; difficulty managing multiple illness management regimes,&lt;ref&gt;Jowsey, T., Dennis, S., Yen, L., Mofizul Islam, M., Parkinson, A., &amp; Dawda, P. (2016). Time to manage: patient strategies for coping with an absence of care coordination and continuity. Sociology of health &amp; illness, 38(6), 854-873.&lt;/ref&gt; and aggravation of one condition by [[symptoms]] or treatment of another.&lt;ref name=Bayliss&gt;Bayliss EA, Steiner JF, Fernald DH, Crane LA, Main DS.  Descriptions of barriers to self-care by persons with comorbid chronic diseases.  Ann Fam Med. 2003 May-Jun;1(1):15-21.&lt;/ref&gt;
Concerning the qualitative experience of people with multimorbid chronic illness, Jowsey et al (2009) write: 
"Co-morbidity increased the amount of time participants spent managing their health and increased patients' dependency on others. Patients with co-morbid conditions encountered problems with the coordination between services and with polypharmacy. Patients prioritised the management of one condition over another; consequently, some health issues could be neglected or compromised. The three most common challenges to patients and carers in managing chronic illness (either caused or made worse by co-morbidity), relate to acting on risk factors, recognising signs and symptoms of illness and managing medications."&lt;ref&gt;Jowsey, T., Jeon, Y. H., Dugdale, P., Glasgow, N. J., Kljakovic, M., &amp; Usherwood, T. (2009). Challenges for co-morbid chronic illness care and policy in Australia: a qualitative study. Australia and New Zealand health policy, 6(1), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; 
These kinds of challenges for people living with multiple chronic conditions have direct implications for health services and the way they support patient self-management.&lt;ref&gt;Jowsey, T., Dennis, S., Yen, L., Mofizul Islam, M., Parkinson, A., &amp; Dawda, P. (2016). Time to manage: patient strategies for coping with an absence of care coordination and continuity. Sociology of health &amp; illness, 38(6), 854-873.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multimorbidity is common in people who are elderly,&lt;ref&gt;Britt, H. C., Harrison, C. M., Miller, G. C., &amp; Knox, S. A. (2008). Prevalence and patterns of multimorbidity in Australia. The Medical Journal of Australia, 189(2), 72-77.&lt;/ref&gt; [[malnourishment|malnourished]], or poor.

Its location is approximately {{convert|30|km|0}}, by road, northeast of the village of [[Buhera]], where the district headquarters are located.&lt;ref&gt;[http://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Zimbabwe_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Buhera%20()%20&amp;toplace=Murambinda%20Business%20Centre%20()&amp;fromlat=-19.3333333&amp;tolat=-19.2666667&amp;fromlng=31.4333333&amp;tolng=31.65 Map Showing Buhera And Murambinda With Distance Marker]&lt;/ref&gt; This location lies approximately {{convert|140|km|0}}, by road, southwest of the city of [[Mutare]] (pop:184,205),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolframalpha.com/entities/cities_population/what_is_the_population_of_mutare,_zimbabwe%3F/gj/re/zo/ Estimated Population of Mutare In 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; the location of the provincial headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Zimbabwe_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Mutare%20()%20&amp;toplace=Murambinda%20Business%20Centre%20()&amp;fromlat=-18.9666667&amp;tolat=-19.2666667&amp;fromlng=32.6666667&amp;tolng=31.65 Road Distance Between Mutare And Murambinda With Map]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The hospital is a rural community hospital,under [[Ministry of Health]] owned and administered by the Sisters of the Little Company of Mary, under the endorsement and supervision of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Harare.It is administered by the Ministry of Health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mohcw.gov.zw/index.php/health-system-delivery.]&lt;/ref&gt; A school of nursing that is affiliated and sits adjacent to the hospital is owned and administered by the same organization, under similar arrangements with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the government of Zimbabwe. The hospital has 200 beds and is the only hospital in Buhera District, with a population of nearly 300,000 over an area with a radius of about {{convert|100|km|mi}}. The professional staff at the hospital includes: 4 [[physician]]s/[[surgeon]]s, and a number of [[nurses]] and [[midwives]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fmh.org.uk/FMH06-07.pdf  Overview of Buhera District] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121215529/http://www.fmh.org.uk/FMH06-07.pdf |date=2008-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The hospital was established in 1968, by the [[Sisters of the Little Company of Mary]], under the auspices of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Harare]]. Technically the [[Government of Zimbabwe]] is expected to provide subsidies and financial assistance, although sometimes that assistance never comes. 

'''Friends of Murambinda Hospital''' (FMH), a [[United Kingdom]]-registered [[non government organization|NGO]], assists in recruiting volunteer healthcare professionals and medical students to work on volunteer, part-time or full-time basis at the hospital.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12221">The '''Myanmar Eye Care Project''' ('''MECP''') is focused on improving the delivery of critical [[Optometry|eye care]] services to at-risk populations in [[Myanmar]]. Founded in 2002 and staffed entirely by [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologists]], it aims to end [[blindness]] in Myanmar. Myanmar is one of the poorest countries in [[Southeast Asia]] and has the highest rate of blindness in the world. Working with partners and a network of providers, MECP operates clinics that provide routine eye care, acute treatment, and surgeries to Myanmar’s poor rural populations. MECP also builds eye care infrastructure in rural communities, trains indigenous physicians and nursing staff, and provides equipment.

==History==
In early 2002, a resident of Sydney, Australia, and former refugee from Myanmar asked Sydney-based ophthalmologist Dr Geoffrey Cohn [[Order of Australia|OAM]]&lt;ref name="OAMcitation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Governer-General Honours List|url=https://www.gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/honours/ad/ad2010/Media%20Notes%20OAM%20(A-E)%20(final).pdf|website=Governer-General Honours List|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to consider setting up an eye care project in Myanmar. Cohn had previously worked ''[[pro bono]]'' in [[Bali]], in the development of eye care projects in [[Indonesia]] in 1989 with Yayasan Kemanusiaan Indonesia (also known as The John Fawcett Foundation),&lt;ref name="JF"&gt;{{cite web|title=the John Fawcett Organisation|url=http://johnfawcett.org/|website=The John Fawcett Organisation|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Papua New Guinea]] from 1993 to 2001 for the Church Medical Council of Papua New Guinea, and in [[Cambodia]] from 1998 to 1999 with [[HelpAge International]].&lt;ref name="HelpAge"&gt;{{cite web|title=HelpAge International|url=http://www.helpage.org/tags/cambodia/|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the support of U Lakkhana, Chief Abbot of the [[The Wachet Jivitadana Sangha Hospital#Kyaswa Monastery and Sayadaw U Lakkhana|Kyaswa Monastery]], and with the help of local project co-coordinators, members of the monastery community and many volunteers, MECP began treating patients in [[The Wachet Jivitadana Sangha Hospital]] by late 2002.&lt;ref name="HollowsLecture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ranzcoabstracts.com/abstract/teaching-and-learning-in-the-resource-poor-world/|title=Hollows Lecture, RANZCO Congress, Perth, 2017.|website=RANZCO abstracts|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DawPhuySinnMon.jpg|thumb|A doctor examining patients on the morning following surgery]]
Following this, a second project was established in a monastery hospital on the slopes of [[Mount Popa]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="MtPopa"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nemet|first1=Arie|last2=Nemet|first2=Pinhas|last3=Cohn|first3=Geoffrey|last4=Sutton|first4=Gina|last5=Sutton|first5=Gerald|last6=Rawson|first6=Richard|title=Causes of blindness in rural Myanmar (Burma): Mount Popa Taung-Kalat Blindness Prevention Project|journal=Clinical Ophthalmology|date=2009|volume=3|pages=413-421}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The current national project co-ordinator and project developer of MECP for the past ten years, Daw Phyu Sinn Mon,&lt;ref name="IPABanalysis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pokharel|first1=Gopal|last2=Khanna|first2=Rohit|title=Prevention of Blindness in Myanmar: Situation Analysis and Strategy for Change|date=2013|url=https://www.iapb.org/wp-content/uploads/Prevention-of-Blindness-in-Myanmar_Situational-Analysis-Strategy-for-Change_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; initially trained as an ophthalmic technician at the Mount Popa-Taung-Kalat centre in 2003.

At the request of U Nayaka, Chief Abbot of Phaung Daw Oo Monastery, another eye care project was started within his monastery at the foot of Mandalay Hills in 2004. In the following years, the service consulted with hundreds of thousands of outpatients, performed tens of thousands of free or low cost eye operations and trained many mid-level ophthalmic technicians (MLOT).&lt;ref name="HollowsLecture" /&gt; The project has continued to grow with the help of donations and visiting teams of eye surgeons, technicians and support staff from Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, Nepal, and the United States of America.&lt;ref name="HollowsLecture" /&gt;

The project has also been responsible for the introduction of subspecialty training of local ophthalmologists in [[vitreoretinal surgery]], glaucoma and corneal specialties.&lt;ref name="HollowsLecture" /&gt; In 2010, Sydney-based vitreoretinal surgeon Dr H. Kwon Kang  introduced vitreoretinal surgery teaching and services to The Wachet Jivitadana Sangha Hospital.&lt;ref name="Eye2Eye"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Imam|first1=Maheen|title=Eye2Eye|date=2017|publisher=Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists|url=https://ranzco.edu/ArticleDocuments/226/ArticleDocuments/226/Spring%202017%20Eye2Eye.pdf.aspx?Embed=Y|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewLight"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tun|first1=Mya|title=Good Samaritans working on Christmas Holidays for eye patients in Sagaing Hills|url=http://www.globalnewlightofmyanmar.com/good-samaritans-working-on-christmas-holidays-for-eye-patients-in-sagaing-hills/|accessdate=19 December 2017|work=Global New Light of Mynamar|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Prof. Gerard Sutton (Professor of [[Corneal]] and [[Refractive]] Surgery) and a team from the New South Wales [[Lions Eye Bank]] worked with Prof. Daw Yee Yee Aung (Professor of Ophthalmology, Mandalay Eye and Ear Hospital) to establish the Mandalay Eye Bank.&lt;ref name="Eye2Eye" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EyeBankJournal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Au|first1=Yee Yee|last2=Sutton|first2=Gerard|last3=Vaddavalli|first3=Pravin|last4=Varma|first4=Meghna|last5=Fernandes|first5=Merle|last6=Devashyam|first6=Raj|last7=Treloggan|first7=Jane|last8=Cooper|first8=Simon|last9=Petsoglou|first9=Con|last10=Machin|first10=Heather|last11=Hodge|first11=Chris|title=Eye Banking in Myanmar: A Review of Services and the Role of International Non-profit Community Based Organizations Transitioning Mandalay Eye Bank Towards Self-Sufficiency|journal=International journal of eye banking|date=2017|volume=5|issue=2|url=http://eyebankingjournal.org/article/eye-banking-myanmar-review-services-role-international-non-profit-community-based-organizations-transitioning-mandalay-eye-bank-towards-self-sufficiency/}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2014 to 2016, paediatric ophthalmologist and academic Dr Judith Newman has also assisted Mandalay Eye and Ear Hospital in training paediatric ophthalmology.&lt;ref name="Eye2Eye" /&gt;

==Ongoing projects==
As of December 2017, the MECP has contributed to eleven projects, nine of which are currently running throughout Myanmar.&lt;ref name="MThrosbyMay2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Throsby|first1=Margaret|title=Interview with Dr Geoffrey Cohn|work=Radio Interview|agency=ABC Classic FM, Breakfast show|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several outreach projects and charity programs are also being supported by MECP.&lt;ref name="IPABanalysis" /&gt; The MECP aims to provide cataract operations either free of cost or at significantly reduced cost and also aims that all visiting ophthalmologists have some university-affiliated teaching experience.&lt;ref name="IPABanalysis" /&gt;

===Eye service at the Wachet Jivitadana Sangha Hospital===
This service was the original pilot project and continues to function as the principal teaching centre. It is one hour southwest of Mandalay.&lt;ref name="AustDoc"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adler|first1=Paul|title=Eye-opener|journal=Australian Doctor|date=2012|volume=March|url=https://doctours.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/media_AusDoc_NewsReview_Mar12.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mandalay Eye Bank===
Responsibility was handed to the MECP and Mandalay Eye and Ear Hospital by former Minister for Health, Prof. [[Pe The Khin]]. The Eye Bank serves as a repository for donated corneas, which may be stored and transplanted into patients with severe corneal disease. The MECP has facilitated technical training (from Sydney Eye Bank Technician Raj Devashayam) to harvest, assess and store corneas as well as surgical training (from Prof. Gerard Sutton) to perform and optimize [[corneal transplantation]].&lt;ref name="EyeBankJournal" /&gt;

===Phaung Daw Oo Monastery, Mandalay===
Commencing in 2003, the MECP has provided equipment for the Eye service, trained many ophthalmic technicians and has recruited two Mandalay surgeons to serve this centre. The centre has become largely self-sufficient with MECP input needed only for equipment maintenance and replacement.&lt;ref name="PhaungDawOo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Phaung Daw Oo School Free Charged Specialist Clinic|url=https://www.findhealthclinics.com/MM/Mandalay/1445297609106784/Phaung-Daw-Oo-School-Free-Charged-Specialist-Clinic|website=Find Health Clinics|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yangon Jivitadana Sangha Hospital===
The centre dates initiatives back to the 1940s; however, the eye service commenced in 2012. The MECP has provided equipment and support, which allows more than twenty Yangon eye surgeons to operate in their spare time. MECP sponsors approximately 3,000 free cataract operations per year.&lt;ref name="YangonJivitadana"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yangon Jivitadana Sangha Hospital|url=http://www.jivitahospital.org/english/medical_treatment.html|website=Jivitadana Sangha Hospital|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Okkalapa General Hospital===
The MECP has significantly contributed to the surgical resident teaching program at the [[North Okkalapa General Hospital]]. This includes funding for teaching, teaching accessories, operating microscopes, lasers and other equipment. The centre now performs up to 2,400 free or subsidised cataract operations per year and provides training for ophthalmologists in residency.

===Thiri Dagon Monastery===
Located in Northeast [[Yangon]] in a highly flood-prone area, the MECP provides ophthalmic technicians and has facilitated two volunteer surgeons to service the area. The centre performs 1,500 free or subsidised cataract operations per year.&lt;ref name="MThrosbyMay2017" /&gt;

===Phyar Pone===
In the wake of [[Cyclone Nargis]] in 2008, the MECP initially established two eye services, which merged into one to serve the people of the [[Ayeyarwady Region]]. The service employs ophthalmic technicians and ophthalmologists to perform 1,200 cataract operations per year.

===Mandalay Eye and Ear Hospital===
The MECP facilitated the donation of 1000 cataract operations in 2013, as well as the donation of specialist equipment. The MECP also provides ongoing support and teaching as required.&lt;ref name="IPABanalysis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NewLight" /&gt;

===Hmawbi Monastery=== 
Requested by U Say Keinda, Chief Abbot of Hmawbi Monastery, the MECP established the service and has employed ophthalmic technicians, provided equipment and arranged for visiting ophthalmologists to service the area. The centre is now independent of MECP.

===Htee Saung Eye Hospital===
Serving as the principle training and development centre for ophthalmic technicians for the MECP, the hospital is the largest service under the governance of the MECP.&lt;ref name="NewLight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tipitaka website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tipitaka|url=http://www.shweyatutipieyehospital.org/|website=Tipitaka Website|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This service employs up to four eye surgeons from Nepal and Laos and frequently accommodates teams of visiting eye surgeons from New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, China and the United States. In 2017, this service is expected to perform over 27,000 free cataract operations.

===Pyin Cee Monastery Eye Hospital===
Created in 2015, the MECP has provided equipment for the centre, trained ophthalmic technicians and has currently recruited one surgeon to serve this centre. The centre performs approximately 2,000 cataract operations per year.&lt;ref name="MThrosbyMay2011"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Throsby|first1=Margaret|title=Interview with Dr Geoffrey Cohn|work=Radio Interview|agency=ABC Radio National|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although U.S. troops will not be assigned to provide care for Ebola patients, rigorous precautions to protect them from the virus will be put in place. On 17 October 2014, [[Marine Corps]] Maj. Gen. James Lariviere told Congress that “We have a no-touch policy and a three-foot separation rule with local nationals”…“A typical soldier’s day will be to get up, have their temperature taken, go out and perform whatever task they are there to do. They will only eat approved food and drink bottled water and wash their hands in chlorine solution. When they get back to their compounds, they will have their temperature taken and do a [[chlorine]] wash again.”&lt;ref name="armytimes.com"/&gt;

The [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]], [[Raymond T. Odierno]], ordered on October 27 a 21-day quarantine of all soldiers returning from Operation United Assistance. Up to 12 soldiers have been quarantined so far in a U.S. base in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/us-army-quarantine-troops-fighting-ebola/story?id=26486775|title=US Army to Quarantine Troops Who Were Fighting Ebola|last=Martinez|first=Luis|date=27 October 2014|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ponnambalam Kumaraswamy''' (often referred to as Poondi Kumaraswamy) (1930 - 1988)  
was a leading [[hydrologist]] from [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;http://alberteinstein.info/vufind1/Record/EAR000021872 Catalogue details about a philosophical correspondence of Albert Einstein to Kumaraswamy when he was a young research engineer at Poondi&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences in 1972&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ias.ac.in/describe/fellow/Kumaraswamy,__Ponnambalam list of Fellows of the Indian Academy of Sciences&lt;/ref&gt; although his only formal education was a [[Civil Engineering]] Bachelor's degree from [[College of Engineering, Guindy]], [[University of Madras]]. Before his death in 1988, at 57 years old, he was the only one to have received both the Homi Bhabha Fellowship 1967-69 &lt;ref&gt;http://homibhabhafellowships.com/HomiBhabhaFellowsList.aspx Mr. P. Kumaraswamy&lt;/ref&gt; (he spent his time at the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]], Bombay, and at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], Cambridge, Massachusetts doing research in Groundwater modeling) and the [[Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship]] 1975-77,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jnmf.in/flist.html list of Jawaharlal Nehru Fellows&lt;/ref&gt; two of the country's top research awards.

During the period of Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship he created the first comprehensive 20 volume hydrological atlas of Tamil Nadu State of India including mathematical models, details of hydraulic structures, among others. He developed also the double bounded probability density function ([[Kumaraswamy distribution]]), a probability density function suitable for physical variables that are usually bounded. This distribution  is in use in electrical, civil,  mechanical, and financial engineering applications. He gave the first practical hard rock well theory&lt;ref&gt;
''Journal of Hydraulics Division'' (Vol 108(10), Oct 1982, pages 1194-1207) of the American Society of Civil Engineers for citation of his work on hard-rock well theory&lt;/ref&gt; that won him the Gold Medal award from Indian Geohydrologists in 1974. He worked also as a design and construction  engineer of two major industrial works, namely, the Tiruchirappalli Boiler Plant, and the Tuticorin Harbour Project. In addition he was involved in the hydraulic design of numerous dams, canals, and other hydraulic structures throughout South India.

He was also well known among many as a [[Periyar Ramasami]] follower even during the periods of emergency (1975) when many of Periyar's followers suffered, some even became afraid to associate with Periyar or his movements due to the atrocities created at that time on the followers. He was a member of the Periyar's rationalist movement and a close friend of [[K. Veeramani]].

'''Sanity''' (from {{lang-la|sānitās}}) refers to the soundness, [[rationality]] and [[health]] of the [[human]] [[mind]], as opposed to [[insanity]]. A person is sane if he/she is [[Rationality|rational]]. In [[modern society]], the term has become exclusively [[synonym]]ous with '''''compos mentis''''' ({{lang-la|compos}}, having mastery of, and {{lang-la|mentis}}, mind), in contrast with ''[[non compos mentis]]'', or [[insane]], meaning troubled conscience. A sane mind is nowadays considered healthy both from its analytical - once called ''rational'' - and emotional aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Steven W.|author2=Antoine Bechara|author3=Hanna Damasio|author4=Daniel Tranel|author5=Antonio R.

K. 2002. ''The Outline of Sanity''. IHS Press&lt;/ref&gt; sanity involves wholeness, whereas insanity implies narrowness and brokenness.

==Psychiatry and psychology==
A theory of sanity was proposed by [[Alfred Korzybski]] in his [[general semantics]]. He believed sanity was tied to the structural fit or lack of thereof, of what is actually going on in the world. He imposed this notion in a [[Map/territory relation|map-territory analogy]]: "A [[map]] ''is not'' the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a "similar structure" to the territory, which accounts for its [[usefulness]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doyletics.com/art/sciencea.htm Science and Sanity] by Alfred Korzybski&lt;/ref&gt; Given that science continually seeks to adjust its theories structurally to fit the facts, i.e., adjusts its maps to fit the territory, and thus advances more rapidly than any other field, he believed that the key to understanding sanity would be found in the study of the methods of science (and the study of structure as revealed by science). The adoption of a scientific outlook and attitude of continual adjustment by the individual toward their assumptions was the way, so he claimed. In other words, there were "factors of sanity to be found in the physico-mathematical [[scientific method|methods of science]]." And he also stressed that sanity requires the awareness that "whatever you say a thing is, it is not"&lt;ref&gt;Korzybski, A. 2010. ''Selections from Science and Sanity''. The New Non-Aristotelian Library, p. VIII.&lt;/ref&gt; because anything expressed through language is not the reality it refers to: language is like a map and the map is not the territory. The territory, that is, reality, remains unnamable, un-speakable, mysterious. Hence, the widespread assumption that we can grasp reality through language involves a degree of insanity.

Psychiatrist [[Philip S. Graven]] suggested the term "un-sane" to describe a condition that is not exactly ''insane'', but not quite ''sane'' either.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neurosemantics.com/nlp-critiques/when-ecology-does-not-count When Ecology Does Not Count: Checking the Ecology of The Ecology Check] by L. Michael Hall, Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Sane Society'', [[1955 in literature|published in 1955]], psychologist [[Erich Fromm]] proposed that, not just individuals, but entire societies "may be lacking in sanity". Fromm argued that one of the most deceptive features of social life involves "consensual validation":&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vault-co.com/index.php?p=826_consensual_validation Consensual validation] at vault-co.com {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is naively assumed that the fact that the majority of people share certain ideas or feelings proves the validity of these ideas and feelings. Nothing is further from the truth... Just as there is a ''[[folie à deux]]'' there is a ''folie à millions''. The fact that millions of people share the same [[vice]]s does not make these vices virtues, the fact that they share so many errors does not make the errors to be truths, and the fact that millions of people share the same form of mental pathology does not make these people sane.&lt;ref&gt;Fromm, Erich. ''The Sane Society'', Routledge, 1955, pp.14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Law ==
In [[criminal law|criminal]] and [[mental health law]], sanity is a [[legal term]] denoting that an individual is of sound mind and therefore can bear legal [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] for their [[Action (philosophy)|actions]]. The official legal term is ''compos mentis''. It is generally defined in terms of the [[wikt:lack|absence]] of sanity (''[[non compos mentis]]'').  It is not a [[medical term]], although the opinions of [[Expert witness|medical expert]]s are often important in making a legal [[Case law|decision]] as to whether someone is sane or insane. It is also not the same concept as [[mental illness]].  One can be acting under profound mental illness and yet be sane, and one can also be [[Court order|ruled]] insane without an underlying mental illness.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Legal definitions of sanity have been little explored by science and medicine, as the concentration has been on illness.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} It remains completely impossible to prove sanity. Furthermore, as Korzybski&lt;ref&gt;Korzybski, A. 2010. ''Selections from Science and Sanity''. The New Non-Aristotelian Library.&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out repeatedly, insanity to various degrees is widespread in the general population, which includes many people that are considered mentally fit in medical and legal terms. In this connection Erich Fromm&lt;ref&gt;Fromm, Erich. 1955/1990. ''The Sane Society''.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to the "pathology of normalcy."

&lt;!-- Diagnosis --&gt;
In the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' DSM-IV and [[DSM-5]], its status was changed. It is no longer classified as a unique mood disorder but is now a specifier, called "with seasonal pattern", for recurrent major depressive disorder that occurs at a specific time of the year and fully remits otherwise.&lt;ref name="DSM-5-Bipolar and related disorders"&gt;{{Cite book| last= American Psychiatric Association| year= 2013| title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders| edition=Fifth| publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing| location=Arlington, VA| pages=123–154| isbn= 978-0-89042-555-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although experts were initially skeptical, this condition is now recognized as a common disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard A.

==Signs and symptoms==
SAD is a type of [[major depressive disorder]], and sufferers may exhibit any of the associated symptoms, such as feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, thoughts of suicide, loss of interest in activities, withdrawal from social interaction, sleep and appetite problems, difficulty with concentrating and making decisions, decreased libido, a lack of energy, or agitation.&lt;ref name="mayoclinic.com"/&gt; Symptoms of winter SAD often include oversleeping or difficulty waking up in the morning, nausea, and a tendency to over eat, often with a craving for carbohydrates, which leads to weight gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Partonen |first1=Dr. Timo |title=Seasonal affective disorder |journal=The Lancet |date=1998 |volume=352 |issue=9137 |pages=1369–1374 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(98)01015-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAD is typically associated with winter depression, but [[springtime lethargy]] or other seasonal mood patterns are not uncommon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder)?|url=http://sadlampsusa.com/articles/what-is-sad/|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Although each individual case is different, in contrast to winter SAD, people who experience spring and summer depression may be more likely to show symptoms such as insomnia, decreased appetite and weight loss, and agitation or anxiety.&lt;ref name="mayoclinic.com"/&gt;

===Bipolar disorder===
''With seasonal pattern'' is a specifier for ''bipolar and related disorders'', including bipolar I disorder and  bipolar II disorder.&lt;ref name="DSM-5-Bipolar and related disorders"/&gt;
Most people with SAD experience [[major depressive disorder]], but as many as 20% may have  a [[bipolar disorder]]. It is important to discriminate between diagnoses because there are important treatment differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mooddisorderscanada.ca/documents/Consumer%20and%20Family%20Support/Depression.pdf |title= Depression |accessdate= August 8, 2009|format= PDF|publisher= Mood Disorders Society of Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, people who have the ''With seasonal pattern'' specifier may experience a depressive episode either due to major depressive disorder or as part of bipolar disorder during the winter and remit in the summer.&lt;ref name="DSM-5-Bipolar and related disorders"/&gt; Around 25% of patients with [[bipolar disorder]] may present with a depressive seasonal pattern, which is associated with bipolar II disorder, rapid cycling, eating disorders, and more depressive episodes.&lt;ref name="Geoffroy-2013"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Geoffroy PA |author2=Bellivier F |author3=Scott J |author4=Boudebesse C |author5=Lajnef M |author6=Gard S |author7=Kahn JP |author8=Azorin JM |author9=Henry C |author10=Leboyer M |author11=Etain B. | title = Bipolar Disorder with Seasonal Pattern: Clinical Characteristics and Gender Influences. | journal = Chronobiol Int. |date=Aug 2013 | doi = 10.3109/07420528.2013.800091 | pmid = 23931033 | volume=30 | issue=9 | pages=1101–7 | pmc=5225270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender displays distinct clinical characteristics associated to seasonal pattern: males present with more Bipolar II disorder and a higher number of depressive episodes, and females with rapid cycling and eating disorders.&lt;ref name="Geoffroy-2013"/&gt;

==Cause==
In many species, activity is diminished during the winter months in response to the reduction in available food, the reduction of [[sunlight]] (especially for [[diurnality|diurnal]] animals) and the difficulties of surviving in cold weather. [[Hibernation]] is an extreme example, but even species that do not hibernate often exhibit changes in behavior during the winter.&lt;ref name="Nesse"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Nesse|first1= Randolph M|authorlink1=Randolph M.

Williams (biologist)|title= Why We Get Sick|edition= First|publisher= Vintage Books|location= New York |isbn= 0812922247|year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably, food was scarce during most of [[human prehistory]], and a tendency toward low mood during the winter months would have been adaptive by reducing the need for calorie intake.&lt;ref name="Kalbitzer, J 2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s00213-013-3308-1| last1 = Kalbitzer | first1 = J. | last2 = Kalbitzer | first2 = U. | last3 = Moos Knudsen | first3 = G.| last4 = Cumming | first4 = P.| last5 = Heinz | first5 = A.| title = How the cerebral serotonin homeostasis predicts environmental changes: a model to explain seasonal changes of brain 5-HTT as intermediate phenotype of the 5-HTTLPR| journal = Psychopharmacology| volume = 230 | issue = 3| pages = 333–343| year = 2013 | pmid = 24150247}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preponderance of women with SAD suggests that the response may also somehow regulate [[reproduction]].&lt;ref name="Nesse"/&gt;

Various proximate causes have been proposed. One possibility is that SAD is related to a lack of [[serotonin]], and [[serotonin polymorphism]]s could play a role in SAD,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Johansson | first1 = C. | last2 = Smedh | first2 = C. | last3 = Partonen | first3 = T. | last4 = Pekkarinen | first4 = P. | last5 = Paunio | first5 = T. | last6 = Ekholm | first6 = J. | last7 = Peltonen | first7 = L. | last8 = Lichtermann | first8 = D. | last9 = Palmgren | first9 = J. | last10 = Adolfsson | first10 = R. | last11 = Schalling | first11 = M. | title = Seasonal Affective Disorder and Serotonin-Related Polymorphisms | doi = 10.1006/nbdi.2000.0373 | journal = Neurobiology of Disease | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 351–357 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11300730 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; although this has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0033291703007372 | last1 = Johansson | first1 = C. | last2 = Willeit | first2 = M. | last3 = Levitan | first3 = R. | last4 = Partonen | first4 = T. | last5 = Smedh | first5 = C. | last6 = Del Favero | first6 = J. | last7 = Bel Kacem | first7 = S. | last8 = Praschak-Rieder | first8 = N. | last9 = Neumeister | first9 = A. | last10 = Masellis | first10 = M. | last11 = Basile | first11 = V. | last12 = Zill | first12 = P. | last13 = Bondy | first13 = B. | last14 = Paunio | first14 = T. | last15 = Kasper | first15 = S. | last16 = Van Broeckhoven | first16 = C. | last17 = Nilsson | first17 = L. -G. | last18 = Lam | first18 = R. | last19 = Schalling | first19 = M. | last20 = Adolfsson | first20 = R. | title = The serotonin transporter promoter repeat length polymorphism, seasonal affective disorder and seasonality | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 785–792 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12877393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mice incapable of turning serotonin into N-acetylserotonin (by [[serotonin N-acetyltransferase]]) appear to express "depression-like" behavior, and antidepressants such as [[fluoxetine]] increase the amount of the enzyme serotonin N-acetyltransferase, resulting in an antidepressant-like effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1034/j.1600-079X.2001.300305.x | last1 = Uz | first1 = T. | last2 = Manev | first2 = H. | title = Prolonged swim-test immobility of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (AANAT)-mutant mice | journal = Journal of Pineal Research | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 166–170 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11316327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory is that the cause may be related to [[melatonin]] which is produced in dim light and darkness by the [[pineal gland]],&lt;ref name="search.proquest" /&gt; since there are direct connections, via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]] and the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]], between the retina and the pineal gland.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Melatonin secretion is controlled by the endogenous circadian clock, but can also be suppressed by bright light.&lt;ref name="search.proquest" /&gt;

One study looked at whether some people could be predisposed to SAD based on personality traits. Correlations between certain personality traits, higher levels of neuroticism, agreeableness, openness, and an avoidance-oriented coping style, appeared to be common in those with SAD.&lt;ref name="Oginska, Halszka 2014"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
According to the American Psychiatric Association [[DSM-IV]] criteria,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gabbard |first=Glen O |title=Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders |edition=3rd |volume=2 |publisher= American Psychiatric Publishing |location= Washington, DC |page= 1296 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seasonal Affective Disorder is not regarded as a separate disorder. It is called a "course specifier" and may be applied as an added description to the pattern of [[major depressive episode]]s in patients with [[major depressive disorder]] or patients with [[bipolar disorder]].

The "Seasonal Pattern Specifier" must meet four criteria: depressive episodes at a particular time of the year; remissions or mania/hypomania at a characteristic time of year; these patterns must have lasted two years with no nonseasonal major depressive episodes during that same period; and these seasonal depressive episodes outnumber other depressive episodes throughout the patient's lifetime. The [[Mayo Clinic]]&lt;ref name="mayoclinic.com"/&gt; describes three types of SAD, each with its own set of symptoms.

==Pathophysiology==
Seasonal mood variations are believed to be related to light. An argument for this view is the effectiveness of bright-[[light therapy]].&lt;ref name = "Lam"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lam | first1 = R. W. | last2 = Levitt | first2 = A.

==Epidemiology==

===Nordic countries===
Winter depression is a common slump in the mood of some inhabitants of most of the [[Nordic countries]]. It was first described by the 6th century [[Goths|Goth]] scholar [[Jordanes]] in his ''[[Getica]]'' wherein he described the inhabitants of [[Scandza]] (Scandinavia).&lt;ref&gt;Jordanes, ''Getica,'' ed. Mommsen, ''Mon. Germanae historica, V,'' Berlin, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland, however, seems to be an exception. A study of more than 2000 people there found the prevalence of seasonal affective disorder and seasonal changes in anxiety and depression to be unexpectedly ''low'' in both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.157.2.234 | last1 = Magnusson | first1 = A. | last2 = Axelsson | first2 = J. | last3 = Karlsson | first3 = M.

A study of Canadians of wholly Icelandic descent also showed low levels of SAD.&lt;ref name="pmid8250680"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.1993.01820240031004 | last1 = Magnússon | first1 = A. | last2 = Axelsson | first2 = J. | title = The prevalence of seasonal affective disorder is low among descendants of Icelandic emigrants in Canada | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 12 | pages = 947–951 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8250680}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has more recently been suggested that this may be attributed to the large amount of fish traditionally eaten by Icelandic people, in 2007 about 90&amp;nbsp;kilograms per person per year as opposed to about 24&amp;nbsp;kg in the US and Canada,&lt;ref name=fao&gt;[ftp://ftp.fao.org/FI/CDrom/CD_yearbook_2008/root/food_balance/section2.pdf Fishery and Aquaculture Statistics: SECTION 2 – Food balance sheets and fish contribution to protein supply, by country from 1961 to 2007]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} .

===Other countries===
In the United States, a diagnosis of seasonal affective disorder was first proposed by [[Norman E. Rosenthal]], M.D. in 1984. Rosenthal wondered why he became sluggish during the winter after moving from sunny South Africa to (cloudy in winter) [[New York (state)|New York]]. He started experimenting increasing exposure to artificial light, and found this made a difference. In [[Alaska]] it has been established that there is a SAD rate of 8.9%, and an even greater rate of 24.9%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britebox.co.uk/sad-study.php?page=latitude SAD Treatment | SAD Lamp | SAD Light | SAD Cure | Seasonal Affected Disorder Britebox Energise Case Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810084450/http://www.britebox.co.uk/sad-study.php?page=latitude |date=August 10, 2011 }}.

Around 20% of Irish people are affected by SAD, according to a survey conducted in 2007. The survey also shows women are more likely to be affected by SAD than men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/mhmhojididid/ One in five suffers from SAD].

==History==
SAD was first systematically reported and named in the early 1980s by Norman E. Rosenthal, M.D., and his associates at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Rosenthal was initially motivated by his desire to discover the cause of his own experience of depression during the dark days of the northern US winter. He theorized that the reduction in available natural light during winter was the cause. Rosenthal and his colleagues then documented the phenomenon of SAD in a placebo-controlled study utilizing light therapy.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal, NE 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshall2003" /&gt;
A paper based on this research was published in 1984. Although Rosenthal's ideas were initially greeted with skepticism, SAD has become well recognized, and his 1993 book, ''Winter Blues''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosenthal |first1=Norman E. |authorlink=Norman E. Rosenthal|title=Winter Blues: Everything You Need to Know to Beat Seasonal Affective Disorder|edition=Revised |location=New York |publisher=The Guilford Press |isbn=978-1593852146 |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has become the standard introduction to the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=More |first=Lee Kremis |title=It's Wintertime: When Winter Falls, Many Find Themselves In Need Of Light |work=Milwaukee Sentinel |publisher= Gannett News Service |date=December 26, 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on SAD in the United States began in 1979 when Herb Kern, a research engineer, had also noticed that he felt depressed during the winter months.  Kern suspected that scarcer light in winter was the cause and discussed the idea with scientists at the NIMH who were working on bodily rhythms. They were intrigued, and responded by devising a lightbox to treat Kern’s depression. Kern felt much better within a few days of treatments, as did other patients treated in the same way.&lt;ref name="Marshall2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ban |first1=Thomas A. |title=An Oral History of Neuropsychopharmacology, The First Fifty Years, Peer Interviews |volume=5 |editor-last=Gershon |editor-first=Samuel |publisher=American College of Neuropsychopharmacology |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that SAD affects risky behavior, and those affected by SAD are more likely to opt for conservative investments, whether financially or scientifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lozano | first1 = G.

The '''Somali Red Crescent Society''' (SRCS) is a non-political, independent humanitarian organization in [[Somalia]] and is part of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]].

== History ==
The society was established in April 1963 through the Presidential Decree No. 187 in 1965.&lt;ref name="hello"&gt;[http://www.bishacas-srcs.org/index.php The Somali Red Crescent Society], Retrieved 24 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, it was formally recognized by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) and became a member of the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]]

== Main programs and activities ==

=== Healthcare ===

==== Outpatient and mobile clinics ====
Since 1991, SRCS has been providing health services to the people of Somalia through a system of 62 Maternal and Child Health Outpatient (MCH/OPD) clinics and 4 mobile clinics,&lt;ref name="bye"&gt;[http://bishacas-srcs.org/downloads/srcs_strategic_%20plan.pdf Somali Red Crescent Society Strategic Plan 2010 - 2014], Retrieved 24 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; targeting vulnerable groups in the community such as mothers, children and wounded individuals. These permanent and mobile clinics are designed to serve the immediate neighborhood communities and remote villages respectively, with a focus on reducing mortality and morbidity. In 2009, 623,342 patients benefitted from the treatments offered in total.&lt;ref name="bye" /&gt;

==== Rehabilitation programmes ====
The SRCS rehabilitation programmes provide health care services to the physically disabled in Somalia through its 3 rehabilitation centers which are located in Mogadishu, Hargeisa and Galkayo respectively.&lt;ref name="haha"&gt;[http://www.bishacas-srcs.org/blocks/s_rehab.php REHABILITATION SERVICES FOR THE PHYSICALLY DISABLED], Retrieved 24 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prosthetics|Prosthesis]] and [[orthotics|orthosis]] appliances are produced in the workshops of these centers, with physiotherapy departments that offer physiotherapy treatment. In 2009, 429 orthoses and 534 prostheses were produced while 1924 persons received physiotherapy treatment.&lt;ref name="bye" /&gt;

==== Keysaney Teaching Hospital ====

Keysaney is one of the largest surgical hospitals in Somalia which focuses on trauma, surgery including electives and referrals from Mogadishu and the other cities  of the country. Keysaney functions as the main teaching hospital in surgery and trauma for residents, interns and students in Somalia.
 
The hospital is Located in Mogadishu, the capital city and was established in 1992, the hospital assisted thousands of weapon and non weapon wounded patients since the outbreak of the [[Somalia Civil War|civil war]]. Support is rendered by the ICRC in the form of payment of salaries and providing medicines and medical equipment through the SRCS. During 2009, 3856 were admitted in the hospital, of which 2361 weapon were wounded patients.&lt;ref name="bye" /&gt;

==== HIV and AIDS program ====
As of 2006, 44,000 Somalis were estimated to be infected with HIV, which is around 0.9% of the population.&lt;ref name="dang"&gt;[http://www.ifrc.org/Docs/Appeals/annual08/MAA64006SO.pdf INTEGRATED HIV AND AIDS PROGRAMME 2008-2010], Retrieved 24 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The HIV and AIDS program initiated by the SRCS focuses on prevention, treatment, care and support throughout the country. There was great emphasis on changing the behavior of the sexually active cohort by promoting safe sex practices, voluntary testing and counselling. In 2009, awareness sessions were conducted by the SRCS HIV staff and volunteers to educate the communities on the risk of HIV infections. 127,000 people benefited from the sessions in total.&lt;ref name="bye" /&gt;

==== WatSan programme ====
The water and sanitation project is a collaboration between the SRCS and [[German Red Cross]] which targets the rural population in Somalia. The aim of the project is to increase the availability of safe water for human consumption, livestock and agriculture so as to meet the basic needs of the target population. Shallow wells and piped water systems were constructed to manage water supply while family latrines were built for improved sanitation. Water filters were given to communities using unsafe surface waters to ensure safe consumption. The total number direct and indirect beneficiaries was 3825 and 22,950 respectively.&lt;ref name="hehe"&gt;[http://www.bishacas-srcs.org/blocks/s_water.php WATER AND SANITATION], Retrieved 24 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surgical smoke''' is the gaseous by-product produced by [[electrosurgery]], laser tissue ablation, [[harmonic scalpel|ultrasonic scalpel]] dissection, high speed drilling or burring, or any procedure done by means of a surgical device that is used to ablate, cut, coagulate, desiccate, fulgurate, or vaporize tissue. Other names for surgical smoke are cautery smoke, plume, diathermy plume, or, sometimes, aerosols produced during surgery, vapor contaminants, or air contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Watson DS|title=Surgical Smoke: What Do We Know|url=http://www.buffalofilter.com/files/7414/2912/2631/Surgical_Smoke_Plume.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence, although the evidence is somewhat controversial, of the dangers from toxicity or possible infectivity of surgical smoke produced by electrosurgery or ultrasonic scalpel procedures; such surgical smoke contains carcinogenic or irritant chemicals and/or bio-aerosols capable of harming patients or operating room personnel upon inhalation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21898022 | doi=10.1007/s00464-011-1872-1 | volume=26 | title=A single-blind controlled study of electrocautery and ultrasonic scalpel smoke plumes in laparoscopic surgery | date=February 2012 | journal=Surg Endosc | pages=337–42 | author=Fitzgerald JE, Malik M, Ahmed I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ball K|year=1995|title=Surgical smoke: Is it safe to breathe?|journal=Today's Surgical Nurse|volume=18|issue=5|pages=16–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nioshtic-2/20038217.html|author=Novak DA|author2=Benson SM|year=2010|title=Understanding and controlling the hazards of surgical smoke|journal=Prev Infect Ambul Care|volume=1|pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
{{blockquote|... Our investigation showed a very high exposure to ultrafine particles (&gt; 100000 cm&lt;sup&gt;–3&lt;/sup&gt;) for surgeons and close assisting operating personnel – alternating with longer periods of low exposure. Although peaks of ultrafine particles will occur in the majority of cases for only short time intervals, they will accumulate during a professional life. Nothing is known yet about the health effects of such very high and very short (seconds to minutes) exposures to ultrafine particles, but it should be kept in mind that without adequate ventilation the particles produced by electrocautery and laser techniques will probably not vanish quite as quickly.

Ultrafine particles in the surgical smoke have to be looked upon with caution, as they may also contain viable cellular material. ...
Probably the most important safety measure in an operation theatre is a reliable air conditioning system that effectively filters out gases and all freshly produced particles. ...
During endoscopic surgery smoke is accumulated and released at once in a relatively high velocity air flow. Surgeons should pay attention that the jet is not pointed at persons standing close. The preferred preventive measure would be to use a commercially available filter that can be attached to the Luer lock valve on the [[cannula]] and that removes cells, particulates, and chemical gases when desufflating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brüske-Hohlfeld I|author2=Preissler G|author3=Jauch  KW|author4=Pitz M|author5=Nowak D|author6=Peters A|author7=Wichmann HE|year=2008|title=Surgical smoke and ultrafine particles|journal=Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1|url=http://occup-med.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6673-3-31|doi=10.1186/1745-6673-3-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Oslo Commitments''' were five international-scope goals agreed upon on May 12, 2010 by the [[Government of Norway]] and the [[UNDP]], at a meeting in Geneva, Swizterland.

The Commitments were concluded with less than five years to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs). The conference brought together government representatives, [[international organization]]s, and [[civil society organization]]s to accelerate global efforts against armed [[violence]]. While reaffirming the [[Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development]], the participants agreed to the following commitments:

* To support, where appropriate, the inclusion of [[armed violence reduction]] and prevention in the Outcome Document of the High Level Plenary Meeting on the MDGs and in subsequent MDG achievement strategies through 2015; 
* To measure and monitor the incidence and impact of armed violence at national and sub-national levels in a transparent way, and develop a set of targets and indicators to assess progress in efforts to achieve measurable reductions in armed violence;
* To recognise the rights of victims of armed violence in a non-discriminatory manner, including provision for their adequate care and rehabilitation, as well as their social and economic inclusion, in accordance with [[national law]]s and applicable international obligations;
* To enhance the potential of development to reduce and prevent armed violence by integrating armed violence prevention and reduction strategies into international, regional, national and sub-national development plans, programmes and assistance strategies;
* To strengthen international cooperation and assistance, including South-South cooperation, to develop national and sub-national capacities for armed violence prevention and reduction and achievement of the MDGs.&lt;ref&gt;The Oslo Commitments: http://www.violenceanddevelopment.org/docs/the_oslo_commitments_final_draft.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{alternative medical systems|traditional}}
'''Traditional African medicine''' is an [[alternative medicine]] discipline involving indigenous [[herbalism]] and African spirituality, typically involving [[divination|diviners]], midwives, and [[herbalism|herbalists]]. Practitioners of traditional African medicine claim to be able to cure various and diverse conditions such as cancers, psychiatric disorders, high blood pressure, [[cholera]], most venereal diseases, epilepsy, asthma, eczema, fever, anxiety, depression, [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]], urinary tract infections, gout, and healing of wounds and burns and even [[Ebola]].&lt;ref name=Helwig2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/a-folk-remedy-for-killer-ebola/148114.article|title=A folk remedy for killer Ebola|date=27 September 1999|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagnosis is reached through spiritual means and a treatment is prescribed, usually consisting of a herbal remedy that is considered to have not only healing abilities but also symbolic and spiritual significance. Traditional African medicine, with its belief that illness is not derived from chance occurrences, but through spiritual or social imbalance, differs greatly from modern [[Medicine|scientific medicine]], which is technically and analytically based. In the 21st century, modern pharmaceuticals and medical procedures remain inaccessible to large numbers of African people due to their relatively high cost and concentration of health facilities in urban centres.

Before the establishment of science-based medicine, [[traditional medicine]] was the dominant medical system for millions of people in Africa but the arrival of the Europeans was a noticeable turning point in the history of this ancient tradition and culture.&lt;ref name=Abdullahi2011/&gt; Herbal medicines in Africa are generally not adequately researched, and are weakly regulated.&lt;ref name=Mills2005/&gt; There is a lack of the detailed documentation of the [[traditional knowledge]], which is generally transferred orally.&lt;ref name=Wyk1999/&gt; Serious [[adverse effect]]s can result from misidentification or misuse of healing plants.&lt;ref name=Helwig2005/&gt;

The [[Geography|geographical reach]] of this article is [[sub-saharan Africa]]. Though, of course [[Neighbourhood|neighbouring]] medical traditions influenced traditional ''African medicine''.&lt;ref group="A"&gt;E.g. by travelling merchants and vice versa, e.g. [[ancient Egyptian medicine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Colonial era===
Science has, in the past, considered methods of traditional knowledge as primitive and backward.&lt;ref name=ConserveAfrica2002/&gt; Under [[Colonisation of Africa|colonial rule]], traditional diviner-healers were outlawed because they were considered by many nations to be practitioners of [[witchcraft]] and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], and declared illegal by the colonial authorities, creating a war against aspects of the indigenous culture that were seen as witchcraft. During this time, attempts were also made to control the sale of herbal medicines.&lt;ref name=Helwig2005/&gt; After [[Mozambique]] obtained independence in 1975, attempts to control traditional medicine went as far as sending diviner-healers to re-education camps. As colonialism and [[Christianity]] spread through Africa, colonialists built general hospitals and Christian missionaries built private ones, with the hopes of making headway against widespread diseases. Little was done to investigate the legitimacy of these practices, as many foreigners believed that the native medical practices were [[Paganism|pagan]] and superstitious and could only be suitably fixed by inheriting Western methods according to [[Richard C. Onwuanibe|Onwuanibe]].&lt;ref name=Onwuanibe27/&gt; During times of conflict, opposition has been particularly vehement as people are more likely to call on the supernatural realm.&lt;ref name=Helwig2005/&gt; Consequently, doctors and health practitioners have, in most cases, continued to shun traditional practitioners despite their contribution to meeting the basic health needs of the population.&lt;ref name=ConserveAfrica2002/&gt;

===Modern period===
{{unbalanced|section|date=September 2014}}
[[File:Nurse at Koidu Hospital Sierra Leone.jpg|thumb|alt=Nurse at Koidu Hospital Sierra Leone consulting with patients|Nurse at Koidu Hospital in Sierra Leone consulting with patients.]]
In recent years, the treatments and remedies used in traditional African medicine have gained more appreciation from researchers in science. Developing countries have begun to realize the high costs of modern [[health care system]]s and the technologies that are required, thus proving Africa's dependence to it.&lt;ref name=ConserveAfrica2002/&gt; Due to this, interest has recently been expressed in integrating traditional African medicine into the continent's national health care systems.&lt;ref name=Helwig2005/&gt; An African healer embraced this concept by making a 48-bed hospital, the first of its kind, in Kwa-Mhlanga, South Africa, which combines traditional methods with [[homeopathy]], [[iridology]], and other Western healing methods, even including some [[Traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Asian medicine]].&lt;ref name=Helwig2005/&gt; However, the highly sophisticated technology involved in modern medicine, which is beginning to integrate into Africa's health care system, could possibly destroy Africa's deep-seated cultural values.&lt;ref name=Onwuanibe27/&gt;

==Diagnostics==

The [[Medical diagnosis|diagnoses]] and chosen methods of treatment in traditional African medicine rely heavily on spiritual aspects, often based on the belief that psycho-spiritual aspects should be addressed before medical aspects. In African culture, it is believed that "nobody becomes sick without sufficient reason."&lt;ref name=Onwuanibe25/&gt; Traditional practitioners look at the ultimate "who" rather than the "what" when locating the cause and cure of an illness, and the answers given come from the [[Cosmology|cosmological beliefs]] of the people.&lt;ref name=Onwuanibe25/&gt; Rather than looking to the medical or physical reasons behind an illness, traditional healers attempt to determine the root cause underlying it, which is believed to stem from a lack of balance between the patient and his or her social environment or the spiritual world, not by natural causes.&lt;ref name=Helwig2005/&gt; Natural causes are, in fact, not seen as natural at all, but manipulations of spirits or the gods. For example, sickness is sometimes said to be attributed to guilt by the person, family, or village for a sin or moral infringement. The illness, therefore, would stem from the displeasure of the gods or God, due to an infraction of universal moral law.&lt;ref name=Onwuanibe25/&gt; According to the type of imbalance the individual is experiencing, an appropriate healing plant will be used, which is valued for its symbolic and spiritual significance as well as for its medicinal effect.&lt;ref name=Helwig2005/&gt;

When a person falls ill, a traditional practitioner uses [[incantation]]s to make a diagnosis. Incantations are thought to give the air of mystical and cosmic connections. [[Divination]] is typically used if the illness is not easily identified, otherwise, the sickness may be quickly diagnosed and given a remedy. If divination is required, then the practitioner will advise the patient to consult a diviner who can further give a diagnosis and cure. Contact with the spirit world through divination often requires not only medication, but [[sacrifice]]s.&lt;ref name=Onwuanibe25/&gt;

==Treatments==
Traditional practitioners use a wide variety of treatments ranging from "magic" to biomedical methods such as [[fasting]] and dieting, herbal therapies, bathing, [[massage]], and surgical procedures.&lt;ref name=ConserveAfrica2002/&gt; [[Migraine]]s, coughs, [[abscess]]es, and [[pleurisy]] are often treated using the method of "bleed-cupping" after which an herbal ointment is applied with follow-up herbal drugs. Animals are also sometimes used to transfer the illness to afterward. Some cultures also rub hot herbal ointment across the patient's eyelids to cure [[headaches]]. [[Malaria]] is treated by both drinking and using the steam from an herbal mixture. Fevers are often treated using a steam bath. Also, vomiting is induced, or [[emetics]], in an attempt to cure some diseases. For example, raw beef is soaked in the drink of an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] person to induce vomiting and nausea and treat [[alcoholism]]. In the [[Bight of Benin]], the natives have been known to use the fat of a boa constrictor to allegedly cure [[gout]] and [[rheumatism]], and it also is thought to relieve chest pain when rubbed into the skin.&lt;ref name=Onwuanibe26/&gt; Approximately 60%-80% of the people in Africa rely on traditional remedies to treat themselves for various diseases.&lt;ref name=Wyk1999_2&gt;{{cite book |last1=van Wyk|first1=Ben-Erik|last2=van Oudtshoorn|first2=Bosch|last3=Gericke|first3=Nigel|year=1999|title=Medicinal Plants of South Africa|page=10|location=Pretoria|publisher=Briza Publications|isbn=978-1-875093-37-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2002/who_edm_trm_2002.1.pdf|date=2002|publisher=WHO|page=1|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large percentage of the people in South Africa also rely on traditional remedies to treat their animals for various diseases.&lt;ref name=McGaw2008/&gt;

===Medicinal plants===
[[File:Prunus africana MS 3588.jpg|thumb|alt=Prunus africana with stripped bark.|Prunus africana with stripped bark.]]
Africa is endowed with many plants that can be used for medicinal purposes to which they have taken full advantage. In fact, out of the approximated 6400 plant species used in tropical Africa, more than 4000 are used as medicinal plants.&lt;ref name=Stanley2004/&gt; Medicinal plants are used in the treatments of many diseases and illnesses, the uses and effects of which are of growing interest to Western societies. Not only are plants used and chosen for their healing abilities, but they also often have symbolic and spiritual significance. For example, leaves, seeds, and twigs that are white, black and red are seen as especially symbolic or magical and possess special properties.&lt;ref name=Helwig2005/&gt;
Examples of some medicinal plants include:

[[File:Inyanga preparing drying out fresh muti.jpg|thumb|Preparing and drying out freshly dug traditional medicines ([[muti]])]]
*'''[[Pygeum (herbal remedy)|Pygeum]] (''Prunus africana''):''' Pygeum is not only used in traditional African medicine, but has developed a following around the world, as a cure for mild-to-moderate [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]], claimed by its users to increase the ease of urination and reduce inflammation and cholesterol deposits. In traditional African practice, the bark is made into tea, whereas elsewhere in the world it is found in powders, [[tincture]]s, and pills. Pygeum has been sold in Europe since the 1970s and is harvested in mass quantities in [[Cameroon]] and [[Madagascar]] each year.&lt;ref name=Helwig2005/&gt;
*'''''[[Securidaca longipedunculata]]:''''' This is a tropical plant found almost everywhere across the continent with different uses in every part of Africa. In [[Tanzania]], the dried bark and root are used as a [[laxative]] for nervous system disorders, with one cup of the mixture being taken daily for two weeks. In East Africa, dried leaves from the plant are used in the treatment of wounds and sores, coughs, venereal diseases, and snakebites. In [[Malawi]], the leaves are also used for wounds, coughs, venereal diseases, and snakebites, as well as [[Schistosomiasis|bilharzia]], and the dried leaves are used to cure headaches. In other parts of the continent, parts of the plant are used to cure skin diseases, malaria, impotence, epilepsy, and are also used as an aphrodisiac.
A study, entitled ''ACE Inhibitor Activity of Nutritive Plants in Kwa-Zulu Natal'', was conducted by Irene Mackraj and S. Ramesar, both of the Department of Physiology and Physiological Chemistry; and H. Baijnath, Department of Biological and Conservation Sciences; University of Kwa-Zulu Natal, Durban, South Africa to examine the effectiveness of 16 plants growing in Africa's [[KwaZulu-Natal]] region, concluding that eight plant extracts may hold value for treating high blood pressure (hypertension).&lt;ref name=MedicalNews2007/&gt; The plants (known locally as [[muti]]) used by traditional healers that the team examined were:

===Spirituality===

Some healers may employ the use of charms, incantations, and the casting of spells in their treatments. The [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]] nature of traditional African medicine between the body and soul, matter, and spirit and their interactions with one another are also seen as a form of magic. Richard Onwuanibe gives one form of magic the name "Extra-Sensory-Trojection." This is the belief among the [[Igbo people|Ibos]] of [[Nigeria]] that medicine men can implant something into a person from a distance to inflict sickness on them. This is referred to by the Ibos as''egba ogwu.'' To remove the malignant object, the intervention of a second medicine man is typically required, who then removes it by making an incision in the patient. ''Egba ogwu'' involves [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic processes]]. Another form of magic used by these practitioners, which is more widely known, is [[sympathetic magic]], in which a model is made of the victim. Actions performed on the model are transferred to the victim, in a manner similar to the familiar [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo doll]]. "In cases where spirits of deceased relatives trouble the living and cause illness, medicine men prescribe remedies, often in the form of propitiatory sacrifice, in order to put them to rest so that they will no longer trouble the living, especially children."&lt;ref name=Onwuanibe26/&gt; Using charms and amulets to cure diseases and illnesses is an uncertain and clouded practice that requires more scientific investigation.

[[File:Kalahari Desert and Kalahari Basin map.svg|thumb|left|The Kalahari Desert (shown in red) and the surrounding Kalahari Basin (in orange).]]
In African cultures, the act of healing is considered a religious act. Therefore, the healing process often attempts to appeal to God because it is ultimately God who can not only inflict sickness, but provide a cure. Africans have a religious world view which makes them aware of the feasibility of divine or spirit intervention in healing with many healers referring to the supreme god as the source of their medical power. For example, the [[!Kung people]] of the [[Kalahari Desert]] believe that the great God Hishe created all things and, therefore, controls all sickness and death. Hishe, however, bestows mystical powers for curing sickness on certain men. Hishe presents himself to these medicine men in dreams and hallucinations, giving them curative power. Because this god is generous enough to give this power to the medicine men, they are expected to practice healing freely. The !Kung medicine men effect a cure by performing a [[African dance|tribal dance]].&lt;ref name=Onwuanibe26&gt;{{Harvnb|Onwuanibe|1979|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loma Marshall, who took expeditions to South West Africa with her family to study the !Kung people, writing two books on their findings, describes the ceremonial curing dance as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At the dances not only may the sick be cured, but pending evil and misfortune averted. The !Kung believe that the great god may send ''Gauwa'' or the ''gauwas'' at any time with ill for someone and that these beings may be lurking awaiting their chance to inflict it. The medicine men in the dances combat them, drive them away, and protect the people. 
Usually there are several medicine men performing at the same time. To cure they go into trance, which varies in depth as the ceremony proceeds... When a man begins, he leaves the line of dancing men, and still singing, leans over the person he is going to cure, going eventually to every person present, even the infants. He places one hand on the person's chest, one on his or her back, and flutters his hands. The !Kung believe that in this way he draws the sickness, real or potential, out of the person through his own arms into himself... Finally, the medicine man throws up his arms to cast the sickness out, hurling it into the darkness back to ''Gauwa'' or the ''gauwasi'', who are there beyond the firelight, with a harp, yelping cry of "Kai Kai Kai."&lt;ref name="[[Richard C. Onwuanibe|Onwuanibe]] 26-27"&gt;{{Harvnb|Onwuanibe|1979|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Loma Marshall does not give any information as to whether or not the dance is successful in curing the patient but says that it purges the people's emotions for their "support and solace and hope."&lt;ref name=Onwuanibe27&gt;{{Harvnb|Onwuanibe|1979|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional medicinal practitioners==
[[File:Inyanga Baba Sylvester.jpg|thumb|[[Traditional healers of South Africa|Inyanga/Sangoma]] from Johannesburg, South Africa]]
Many traditional medicinal practitioners are people without education, who have rather received knowledge of medicinal plants and their effects on the human body from their forebears.&lt;ref name=Helwig2005/&gt; They have a deep and personal involvement in the healing process and protect the therapeutic knowledge by keeping it a secret.&lt;ref name=ConserveAfrica2002/&gt;

[[File:Uganda cesarean section.gif|thumb|alt=Successful Cesarean section performed by indigenous healers in Kahura, Uganda. As observed by R. W. Felkin in 1879.|Successful Cesarean section performed by indigenous healers in Kahura, Uganda. As observed by R. W. Felkin in 1879.]]
In a manner similar to [[medicine|orthodox medicinal practice]], the practitioners of traditional medicine specialize in particular areas of their profession. Some, such as the [[inyanga]]s of [[Swaziland]] are experts in herbalism, whilst others, such as the South African [[sangoma]]s, are experts in spiritual healing as [[Divination|diviners]], and others specialize in a combination of both forms of practice. There are also traditional bone setters and birth attendants.&lt;ref name=ConserveAfrica2002/&gt; [[herbalism|Herbalists]] are becoming more and more popular in Africa with an emerging herb trading market in [[Durban]] that is said to attract between 700,000 and 900,000 traders per year from South Africa, [[Zimbabwe]], and [[Mozambique]]. Smaller trade markets exist in virtually every community.&lt;ref name=Helwig2005&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3435100785.html |title=Traditional African medicine |author=Helwig, David|year=2005 |work=Gale Encyclopedia of Alternative Medicine |publisher= |accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their knowledge of herbs has been invaluable in African communities and they were the only ones who could gather them in most societies. [[Midwifery|Midwives]] also make extensive use of indigenous plants to aid childbirth. African healers commonly "describe and explain illness in terms of social interaction and act on the belief that religion permeates every aspect of human existence."&lt;ref name=ConserveAfrica2002/&gt;

===Payments===
Traditional healers, like any other profession, are rewarded for their services. In African societies, the payment for a treatment depends on its efficacy. They do not request payment until after the treatment is given. This is another reason many prefer traditional healers to western doctors who require payment before the patient has assessed the effectiveness of the treatment.&lt;ref name=Mokaila2001&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drury.edu/multinl/story.cfm?ID=2524&amp;NLID=166 |title=Traditional Vs. Western Medicine-African Context |author=Mokaila, Aone |year=2001 |work=Drury University, Springfield, Missouri |publisher= |accessdate=11 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914164630/http://www.drury.edu/multinl/story.cfm?ID=2524&amp;NLID=166 |archivedate=14 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The payment methods have changed over time, with many practitioners now asking for monetary payment, especially in urban settings, rather than their receiving good in exchange, as happened formerly.&lt;ref name=ConserveAfrica2002/&gt;

There are also a growing number of [[Quackery|fraudulent practitioners]] who only interested in making money, especially in urban areas.&lt;ref name=SAH2&gt;WHO http://www.who.int/mental_health/resources/en/MNH%20of%20refugees_unit6_7pdf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IOL:SHRINE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside the Fake healers shrine|url=http://africawitness.wordpress.com/2011/02/11/366/|date=11 February 2011|publisher=Africa Witness|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning the trade===
Some healers learn the trade through personal experience while being treated as a patient who decide to become healers upon recovery. Others become traditional practitioners through a "spiritual calling" and, therefore, their diagnoses and treatments are decided through the supernatural.&lt;ref name=ConserveAfrica2002/&gt; In some cultures, a sign of calling can come from mental disarrangement said to be caused by ''agwu Nshi,'' the spirit of divining, through which the healer gains inspiration. Through this training, psychological stability is eventually attained.&lt;ref name=Onwuanibe25/&gt; Another route is receive the knowledge and skills passed down informally from a close family member such as a father or uncle, or even a mother or aunt in the case of midwives. [[Apprenticeship]] to an established practitioner, who formally teaches the trade over a long period of time and is paid for their tutoring, is another route to becoming a healer.&lt;ref name=ConserveAfrica2002/&gt; The training is complex, depending on the kind of medical practice that the aspiring practitioner wants to be a part of. Once the trainee is officially initiated as a healer, they are, in some societies, considered to be half-man and half spirit, possessing the power to mediate between the human and supernatural world to invoke spiritual power in their healing processes.&lt;ref name=Onwuanibe25&gt;{{Harvnb|Onwuanibe|1979|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importance===
In Africa, the importance of traditional healers and remedies made from indigenous plants play a crucial role in the health of millions. According to the [[International Development Research Centre|International Development Research Centre (IDRC)]], one estimate puts the number of Africans who routinely use these services for primary health care as high as 85% in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name=Stanley2004/&gt; The relative ratios of traditional practitioners and university trained doctors in relation to the whole population in African countries showcases this importance. For example, in [[Ghana]], in Kwahu district, for every traditional practitioner there are 224 people, against one university trained doctor for nearly 21,000. In [[Swaziland]], the same situation applies, where for every healer there are 110 people whereas for every university trained doctor there are 10,000 people.&lt;ref name=ConserveAfrica2002/&gt; According to Nairobi-based specialist in biodiversity and traditional medicine with the IDRC Francois Gasengayire, there is one healer for every 200 people in the Southern Africa region which is a much greater doctor-to-patient ratio than is found in North America.&lt;ref name=Stanley2004/&gt;

This table showing the ratio of traditional medical practitioner to patient and Western practitioner to patient shows that in many parts of Africa, practitioners trained in modern medicine are few and far between. Because of this, healers prove to be a large and influential group in primary health care and an integral part of the African culture and are required for the health of its people. Without them, many people would go untreated.

Medications and treatments that Western [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]] manufacture are far too costly and not available widely enough for most Africans. Many rural African communities are not able to afford the high price of pharmaceuticals and can not readily obtain them even if they were affordable; therefore, healers are their only means of medical help. According to Sekagya Yahaya Hills, who is a university-trained dentist and a traditional healer in [[Uganda]], there are promising signs that some of the plant-based remedies offered by medicine-men are not just affordable, but also effective, even in treating [[AIDS]].&lt;ref name=Stanley2004/&gt; Hills read his Declaration of Traditional Healers at the 13th International Conference on AIDS and [[sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs) in Africa, which summarized the important role of traditional medicine, stating: "As traditional healers, we are the most trusted and accessible health care providers in our communities. We have varied and valuable experience in treating AIDS-related illness and accept the great responsibility of continuing to do so."&lt;ref name=Stanley2004/&gt; Because this form of medicine is "the most affordable and accessible system of health care for the majority of the African rural population," the African Union declared 2001 to 2010 to be the Decade for African Traditional Medicine with the goal of making "safe, efficacious, quality, and affordable traditional medicines available to the vast majority of the people."&lt;ref name=Stanley2004&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-55582-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |title=Recognition and Respect for African Traditional Medicine |author=Stanley, Bob |date=13 February 2004 |work=Canada's International Development Research Centre |publisher= |accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excessive use of plants is an [[oecology|oecologic]] risk, as this may cause their extinction.&lt;ref name=SAH7&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infohouse.p2ric.org/ref/40/39776.pdf|title=Medicinal Plants and Traditional Medicine in Africa: Constraints and Challenges}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SAH6&gt;African Perspectives on Genetic Resources: A Handbook on Laws, Policies, and Institutions Governing Access and Benefit-sharing, K Nnadozie - 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with modern medicine==
Before the establishment of science-based medicine, traditional medicine was the dominant medical system for millions of people in Africa but the arrival of the Europeans was a noticeable turning point in the history of this ancient tradition and culture.&lt;ref name=Abdullahi2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abdullahi|first1=AA|title=Trends and Challenges of Traditional Medicine in Africa|journal=African Journal of Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicines|volume=8|issue=5S|pages=115–23|year=2011|issn=0189-6016|doi=10.4314/ajtcam.v8i5S.5|pmc=3252714|pmid=22754064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although modern [[Medicine|scientific medicine]] is successful in developed countries, it doesn't have the same positive impact in many of the underdeveloped African countries.&lt;ref name=ConserveAfrica2002/&gt; Though Western practices can make an impact in health care practices, in certain areas such as in the spread of various diseases, it cannot integrate wholly into the culture and society.&lt;ref name=ConserveAfrica2002/&gt; This makes the traditional African practitioners a vital part of their health care system. There are many reasons why the Western medical system has not been as effective in Africa as it has in more developed parts of the world. Hospitals and medical facilities are difficult for many Africans to get to. With vast areas of land and poor road and transportation systems, many native Africans have to travel immense distances on foot to reach help. Once they arrive they are often required to wait in line for up to 8&amp;nbsp;hours, especially in urban areas, as the lack of clinics and resources cause over-crowding. Patients are often not told the cause of their illness or much information about it all, so they have no way to prevent or prepare for it. The technology used is usually of poor quality, which impairs the quality of treatment. Modern medicine can also be too expensive for the average African to afford, making it difficult for them to receive proper care. Finally, Modern medicine removes native Africans from the culture and tradition and forces them into a setting that they are not comfortable with, away from their family and traditions which are of utmost importance to them. They do not get the proper spiritual healing that their culture seeks and traditional ideology requires.&lt;ref name=ConserveAfrica2002&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pambazuka.net/en/category.php/media/6560|title=Africa: Overview on Medicinal Plants and Traditional Medicine  |author=Conserve Africa |date=4 May 2002 |work=Conserve Africa |publisher=Pambazuka News |accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there has been more interest expressed recently in the effects of some of the medicinal plants of Africa. "The [[pharmaceutical industry]] has come to consider traditional medicine as a source for identification of bio-active agents that can be used in the preparation of synthetic medicine."&lt;ref name=ConserveAfrica2002/&gt; Pharmaceutical industries are looking into the medicinal effects of the most commonly and widely used plants to use in drugs. It's apparent that there are some things that can be learned from traditional African practice. In comparing the techniques of African healers and Western techniques, T. Adeoze Lambo, a Nigerian psychiatrist, stated in 1979, "At about three years ago, we made an evaluation, a programme of their work, and compared this with our own, and we discovered that actually they were scoring almost sixty percent success in their treatment of [[neurosis]].

'''Universal health care''' (also called '''universal health coverage''', '''universal coverage''', '''universal care''', or '''socialized health care''') is a [[health care]] system that provides health care and financial protection to all citizens of a particular country. It is organized around providing a specified package of benefits to all members of a society with the end goal of providing financial risk protection, improved access to health services, and improved health outcomes.&lt;ref name="WHO 2010"&gt;{{cite web|author=World Health Organization|date=November 22, 2010|title=The world health report: health systems financing: the path to universal coverage|location=Geneva|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=978-92-4-156402-1|url=http://www.who.int/whr/2010/en/|accessdate=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal health care does not imply coverage for all people for everything. Universal health care can be determined by three critical dimensions: who is covered, what services are covered, and how much of the cost is covered.&lt;ref name="WHO 2010"/&gt; It is described by the [[World Health Organization]] as a situation where citizens can access health services without incurring financial hardship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs395/en/|title=Universal health coverage (UHC)|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Director General of WHO describes universal health coverage as the “single most powerful concept that public health has to offer” since it unifies “services and delivers them in a comprehensive and integrated way”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matheson|first=Don *|date=2015-01-01|title=Will Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Lead to the Freedom to Lead Flourishing and Healthy Lives?

==History==
The first move towards a national health insurance system was launched in [[Germany]] in 1883, with the Sickness Insurance Law. Industrial employers were mandated to provide injury and illness insurance for their low-wage workers, and the system was funded and administered by employees and employers through "sick funds", which were drawn from deductions in workers' wages and from employers' contributions. Other countries soon began to follow suit. In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[National Insurance Act 1911]] provided coverage for primary care (but not specialist or hospital care) for wage earners, covering about one third of the population. The [[Russian Empire]] established a similar system in 1912, and other industrialized countries began following suit. By the 1930s, similar systems existed in virtually all of Western and Central Europe. [[Japan]] introduced an employee health insurance law in 1927, expanding further upon it in 1935 and 1940. Following the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, the [[Soviet Union]] established a fully public and centralized health care system in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rowland |first=Diane |last2=Telyukov |first2=Alexandre V. |date=Fall 1991 |title=Soviet Healthcare From Two Perspectives |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/10/3/71.full.pdf |journal=Health Affairs |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=OECD Reviews of Health Systems OECD Reviews of Health Systems: Russian Federation 2012 |pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not a truly universal system at that point, as rural residents were not covered.

In [[New Zealand]], a universal health care system was created in a series of steps, from 1939 to 1941.&lt;ref name="Abel-Smith 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New Zealand"&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Raymond|year=1993|chapter=Two Social Security Acts|title=Closing the door to destitution: the shaping of the Social Security Acts of the United States and New Zealand|location=University Park|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|page=14|isbn=978-0-271-02665-7|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=mPMJRVEaGqAC&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=March 11, 2013}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|last=Mein Smith|first=Philippa|year=2012|chapter=Making New Zealand 1930–1949|title=A concise history of New Zealand|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=164–65|isbn=978-1-107-40217-1|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=C4WZFbNXpPMC&amp;pg=PA165|accessdate=March 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Australia]], the state of [[Queensland]] introduced a free public hospital system in the 1940s.

Following [[World War II]], universal health care systems began to be set up around the world. On July 5, 1948, the United Kingdom launched its universal [[National Health Service]]. Universal health care was next introduced in the [[Nordic countries]] of [[Sweden]] (1955),&lt;ref name="Sweden"&gt;{{cite book|last=Serner|first=Uncas|year=1980|chapter=Swedish health legislation: milestones in reorganisation since 1945|editor1-last=Heidenheimer|editor1-first=Arnold J.|editor2-last=Elvander|editor2-first=Nils|editor3-last=Hultén|editor3-first=Charly|title=The shaping of the Swedish health system|location=New York|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=103|isbn=978-0-312-71627-1|quote=Universal and comprehensive health insurance was debated at intervals all through the Second World War, and in 1946 such a bill was voted in Parliament.

Universal health insurance was implemented in [[Australia]] beginning with the ''Medibank'' system  which led to universal coverage under the [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] system.

From the 1970s to the 2000s, Southern and Western European countries began introducing universal coverage, most of them building upon previous health insurance programs to cover the whole population. For example, [[France]] built upon its 1928 national health insurance system, with subsequent legislation covering a larger and larger percentage of the population, until the remaining 1% of the population that was uninsured received coverage in 2000.&lt;ref name=austerity&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/austerity-and-the-unraveling-of-european-universal-health-care|title=Austerity and the Unraveling of European Universal Health Care |publisher=Dissent Magazine|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Germany"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bärnighausen|first1=Till|last2=Sauerborn|first2=Rainer|date=May 2002|title=One hundred and eighteen years of the German health insurance system: are there any lessons for middle- and low-income countries?|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=54|issue=10|pages=1559–87|doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(01)00137-X|pmid=12061488}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Busse|first1=Reinhard|last2=Riesberg|first2=Annette|year=2004|title=Germany|journal=Health Care Systems in Transition|volume=6|issue=9|issn=1020-9077|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/80703/E85472.pdf|accessdate=October 8, 2013}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carrin|first1=Guy|last2=James|first2=Chris|date=January 2005|title=Social health insurance: key factors affecting the transition towards universal coverage|journal=International Social Security Review|volume=58|issue=1|pages=45–64|doi=10.1111/j.1468-246X.2005.00209.x|url=http://www.who.int/health_financing/documents/shi_key_factors.pdf|accessdate=October 8, 2013}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hassenteufel|first1=Patrick|last2=Palier|first2=Bruno|date=December 2007|title=Towards neo-Bismarckian health care states?

==Funding models==
{{see also|Health care economics}}
Universal health care in most countries has been achieved by a mixed model of funding. General taxation revenue is the primary source of funding, but in many countries it is supplemented by specific levies (which may be charged to the individual and/or an employer) or with the option of private payments (by direct or optional insurance) for services beyond those covered by the public system. Almost all European systems are financed through a mix of public and private contributions.&lt;ref name="Bentes 2004"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bentes|first1=Margarida|last2=Dias|first2=Carlos Matias|last3=Sakellarides|first3=Sakellarides|last4=Bankauskaite|first4=Vaida|year=2004|title=Health care systems in transition: Portugal|location=Copenhagen|publisher=WHO Regional Office for Europe on behalf of the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/e82937.pdf|accessdate=August 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most universal health care systems are funded primarily by [[tax revenue]] (like in [[Portugal]]&lt;ref name="Bentes 2004" /&gt; Spain, Denmark, and Sweden). Some nations, such as Germany and France&lt;ref name="PNHP 2004"&gt;{{cite web|author=Physicians for a National Health Program|year=2004|title=International health systems|location=Chicago|publisher=Physicians for a National Health Program|url=http://www.pnhp.org/facts/international_health_systems.php?page=all|accessdate=November 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan&lt;ref name="Chua 2006"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chua|first=Kao-Ping|date=February 10, 2006|title=Single payer 101|location=Sterling, Virginia|publisher=American Medical Student Association|url=http://www.amsa.org/uhc/SinglePayer101.pdf|archivedate=October 24, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024133141/http://www.amsa.org/uhc/SinglePayer101.pdf|accessdate=November 7, 2006|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; employ a multipayer system in which health care is funded by private and public contributions. However, much of the non-government funding is by contributions by employers and employees to regulated [[non-profit]] sickness funds. Contributions are compulsory and defined according to law. A distinction is also made between municipal and national healthcare funding. For example, one model is that the bulk of the healthcare is funded by the municipality, speciality healthcare is provided and possibly funded by a larger entity, such as a municipal co-operation board or the state, and the medications are paid by a state agency. A paper by Sherry A. Glied from [[Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health|Columbia University]] found that universal health care systems are modestly redistributive, and that the progressivity of health care financing has limited implications for overall [[income inequality]].&lt;ref name="Glied 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Sherry A. |last=Glied |title=Health Care Financing, Efficiency, and Equity |date=March 2008 |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 13881 |doi=10.3386/w13881 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compulsory insurance===
{{main|National health insurance}}
This is usually enforced via legislation requiring residents to purchase insurance, but sometimes the government provides the insurance. Sometimes, there may be a choice of multiple public and private funds providing a standard service (as in Germany) or sometimes just a single public fund (as in Canada). [[Healthcare in Switzerland]] and the US [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] are based on compulsory insurance.&lt;ref name="Tomasky 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tomasky|first=Michael|date=March 21, 2010|title=Healthcare vote: Barack Obama passes US health reform by narrow margin|work=Michael Tomasky's blog|location=London|publisher=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/22/health-care-vote-us-obama|accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2012/12/26/switzerland-a-case-study-in-consumer-driven-health-care/ |title=Switzerland – a case study in consumer driven health care| work=Forbes | first=Avik | last=Roy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some European countries, in which private insurance and universal health care coexist, such as Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, the problem of [[adverse selection]] is overcome by using a risk compensation pool to equalize, as far as possible, the risks between funds. Thus, a fund with a predominantly healthy, younger population has to pay into a compensation pool and a fund with an older and predominantly less healthy population would receive funds from the pool. In this way, sickness funds compete on price, and there is no advantage to eliminate people with higher risks because they are compensated for by means of risk-adjusted capitation payments. Funds are not allowed to pick and choose their policyholders or deny coverage, but they compete mainly on price and service. In some countries, the basic coverage level is set by the government and cannot be modified.&lt;ref name="Varkevisser 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Varkevisser|first1=Marco|last2=van der Geest|first2=Stéphanie|year=2002|title=Competition among social health insurers: a case study for the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany|journal=Research in Healthcare Financial Management|volume=7|issue=1|pages=65–84|url=http://oldwww.bmg.eur.nl/personal/varkevisser/RHFM_7(1)_sickness%20funds.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516102517/http://oldwww.bmg.eur.nl/personal/varkevisser/RHFM_7(1)_sickness%20funds.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 16, 2013|accessdate=November 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Republic of Ireland]] at one time had a "community rating" system by [[VHI]], effectively a single-payer or common risk pool. The government later opened VHI to competition but without a compensation pool. That resulted in foreign insurance companies entering the Irish market and offering cheap health insurance to relatively healthy segments of the market, which then made higher profits at VHI's expense. The government later reintroduced community rating by a pooling arrangement and at least one main major insurance company, BUPA, then withdrew from the Irish market.

Among the potential solutions posited by economists are single-payer systems as well as other methods of ensuring that health insurance is universal, such as by requiring all citizens to purchase insurance or limiting the ability of insurance companies to deny insurance to individuals or vary price between individuals.&lt;ref name="Rothschild 1976"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rothschild|first1=Michael|last2=Stiglitz|first2=Joseph|date=November 1976|title=Equilibrium in competitive insurance markets: an essay on the economics of imperfect information|journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=90|issue=4|pages=629–49|doi=10.2307/1885326|jstor=1885326|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~dirkb/teach/pdf/rothschild/1976%20equilibrium%20in%20competitive%20insurance.pdf|accessdate=March 20, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203181137/http://www.econ.yale.edu/~dirkb/teach/pdf/rothschild/1976%20equilibrium%20in%20competitive%20insurance.pdf|archive-date=December 3, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Belli 2001"&gt;{{cite web|last=Belli|first=Paolo|date=March 2001|title=How adverse election affects the health insurance market.

===Single payer===
{{Main|Single-payer health care}}
Single-payer health care is a system in which the government, rather than private insurers, pays for all [[health care]] costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/single-payer single-payer], Merriam Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Single-payer systems may contract for healthcare services from private organizations (as is the case in [[Canada]]) or own and employ healthcare resources and personnel (as was the case in [[England]] before the introduction of the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012|Health and Social Care Act]]). "Single-payer" thus describes only the funding mechanism and refers to health care financed by a single public body from a single fund and does not specify the type of delivery or for whom doctors work. Although the fund holder is usually the state, some forms of single-payer use a mixed public-private system.

===Tax-based financing===
In tax-based financing, individuals contribute to the provision of health services through various taxes. These are typically pooled across the whole population, unless local governments raise and retain tax revenues. Some countries (notably the United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, [[Italy]], Spain, Portugal and the [[Nordic countries]]) choose to fund health care directly from taxation alone. Other countries with insurance-based systems effectively meet the cost of insuring those unable to insure themselves via [[social security]] arrangements funded from taxation, either by directly paying their medical bills or by paying for insurance premiums for those affected.

===Social health insurance===
In a social health insurance system, contributions from workers, the self-employed, enterprises, and governments are pooled into a single or multiple funds on a compulsory basis. It is based on risk pooling.&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.searo.who.int/PDS_DOCS/B3457.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The social health insurance model is also referred to as the 'Bismarck Model,' after Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who introduced the first universal health care system in Germany in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnhp.org/single_payer_resources/health_care_systems_four_basic_models.php&lt;/ref&gt; The funds typically contract with a mix of public and private providers for the provision of a specified benefit package. Preventive and public health care may be provided by these funds or responsibility kept solely by the Ministry of Health. Within social health insurance, a number of functions may be executed by parastatal or non-governmental sickness funds or in a few cases, by private health insurance companies. Social health insurance is used in a number of Western European countries and increasingly in Eastern Europe as well as in Israel and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |editor-last=Saltman |editor-first=Richard B. |editor2-last=Busse |editor2-first=Reinhard |editor3-last=Figueras |editor3-first=Josep |title=Social health insurance systems in western Europe |url=http://www.who.int/health_financing/documents/shi_w_europe.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private insurance===
In private health insurance, premiums are paid directly from employers, associations, individuals and families to insurance companies, which pool risks across their membership base. Private insurance includes policies sold by commercial for profit firms, non-profit companies, and community health insurers. Generally, private insurance is voluntary in contrast to social insurance programs, which tend to be compulsory.&lt;ref name="WHO 2008"&gt;{{cite web|author=World Health Organization|year=2008|title=Health financing mechanisms: private health insurance|location=Geneva|publisher=World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/health_financing/mechanisms/en/index3.html|archivedate=October 9, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009045515/http://www.who.int/health_financing/mechanisms/en/index3.html|accessdate=April 11, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries with universal coverage, private insurance often excludes many health conditions that are expensive and the state health care system can provide. For example, in the United Kingdom, one of the largest private health care providers is [[BUPA]], which has a long list of general exclusions even in its highest coverage policy,&lt;ref name="Bupa 2010"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bupa|year=2010|title=Individuals: Health and life cover: Health care select 1: Key features of this health insurance plan: What's covered? What's not covered?|location=London|publisher=Bupa|url=http://www.bupa.co.uk/individuals/health-life-cover/health-insurance/healthcare-select-1|archivedate=April 9, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409024558/http://www.bupa.co.uk/individuals/health-life-cover/health-insurance/healthcare-select-1|accessdate=April 11, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of which are routinely provided by the [[National Health Service]]. In the United States, dialysis treatment for end stage renal failure is generally paid for by government, not by the insurance industry. Those with privatized [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] ([[Medicare Advantage]]) are the exception and must get their dialysis paid through their insurance company, but with end stage [[renal failure]] generally cannot buy Medicare Advantage plans.&lt;ref name="CMS 2010"&gt;{{cite web|author=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services|year=2010|title=Medicare coverage of kidney dialysis &amp; kidney transplant services|location=Baltimore|publisher=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services|url=http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/10128.pdf|accessdate=April 11, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527131844/http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/10128.pdf|archive-date=May 27, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Netherlands, which has regulated competition for its main insurance system (but subject to a budget cap), insurers must cover a basic package for all enrollees, but may choose which additional services they cover in other, supplementary plans (which most people possess - citation needed).

The [[Planning Commission of India]] has also suggested that the country should embrace insurance to achieve universal health coverage.&lt;ref name="Varshney 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Varshney|first1=Vibha|last2=Gupta|first2=Alok|last3=Pallavi|first3=Aparna|date=September 30, 2012|title=Universal health scare|work=Down To Earth|location=New Delhi|publisher=Society for Environmental Communications|url=http://www.downtoearth.org.in/content/universal-health-scare|accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; General tax revenue is currently used to meet the essential health requirements of all people.

===Community-based health insurance===
A particular form of private health insurance that has often emerged if financial risk protection mechanisms have only a limited impact is community-based health insurance. Individual members of a specific community pay to a collective health fund, which they can draw from when they need of medical care. Contributions are not risk-related, and there is generally a high level of community involvement in the running of these plans.

==Implementation and comparisons==

Universal health care systems vary according to the degree of government involvement in providing care and/or health insurance. In some countries, such as the UK, Spain, Italy, Australia and the Nordic countries, the government has a high degree of involvement in the commissioning or delivery of health care services and access is based on residence rights, not on the purchase of insurance. Others have a much more pluralistic delivery system, based on obligatory health with contributory insurance rates related to salaries or income and usually funded by employers and beneficiaries jointly.

Sometimes, the health funds are derived from a mixture of insurance premiums, salary related mandatory contributions by employees and/or employers to regulated sickness funds, and by government taxes. These insurance based systems tend to reimburse private or public medical providers, often at heavily regulated rates, through mutual or publicly owned medical insurers. A few countries, such as the Netherlands and Switzerland, operate via privately owned but heavily regulated private insurers, which are not allowed to make a profit from the mandatory element of insurance but can profit by selling supplemental insurance.

Universal health care is a broad concept that has been implemented in several ways. The common denominator for all such programs is some form of government action aimed at extending access to health care as widely as possible and setting minimum standards. Most implement universal health care through legislation, regulation and taxation. Legislation and regulation direct what care must be provided, to whom, and on what basis. Usually, some costs are borne by the patient at the time of consumption, but the bulk of costs come from a combination of compulsory insurance and tax revenues. Some programs are paid for entirely out of tax revenues. In others, tax revenues are used either to fund insurance for the very poor or for those needing long-term chronic care.

The United Kingdom [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] in 2003 published an international comparison of ten different health care systems in ten developed countries, nine universal systems against one non-universal system (the United States), and their relative costs and key health outcomes.&lt;ref name="NAO 2003"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Audit Office|date=February 1, 2003|title=International health comparisons: a compendium of published information on healthcare systems, the provision of health care and health achievement in 10 countries|location=London|publisher=National Audit Office|url=http://www.nao.org.uk/report/international-health-comparisons-a-compendium-of-published-information-on-healthcare-systems-the-provision-of-health-care-and-health-achievement-in-10-countries/|accessdate=November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wider international comparison of 16 countries, each with universal health care, was published by the [[World Health Organization]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="WHO 2004"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grosse-Tebbe|first1=Susanne|last2=Figueras|first2=Josep|year=2004|title=Snapshots of health systems: the state of affairs in 16 countries in summer 2004|location=Copenhagen|publisher=World Health Organization on behalf of the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/e85400.pdf|archivedate=September 26, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926062927/http://www.euro.who.int/document/e85400.pdf|accessdate=November 7, 2007|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, government involvement also includes directly managing the [[health care system]], but many countries use mixed public-private systems to deliver universal health care.

{{main|Immunology}}
'''Veterinary immunology''' is the study of all aspects of [[immune system]] in animals. It is a branch under [[Biomedical sciences|biomedical science]] and related to [[zoology]] and [[veterinary science]]s. Interests include malfunctions and disorders, but also health, of the immune system in animals. It is interested in how the immune system works, how vaccines prevent disease and why vaccines sometimes do not work and cause adverse reactions.

'''Water supply in Afghanistan''' is characterized by a number of achievements and challenges. Among the achievements are:
* the expansion of rural water supply infrastructure with the active participation of communities as part of the National Solidarity Program;
* the successful expansion of water supply in the city of [[Herat]] and towns such as [[Kunduz]]; and
* a reform of the institutional framework for urban water supply through the decentralization of service provision from an ineffective national agency to local utilities managed on the basis of commercial principles.

Challenges include
* the tense security situation, especially in the south and east of the country, that limits the mobility of personnel;
* dilapidated infrastructure as a result of decades of war and neglect;
* a high level of [[non-revenue water]] estimated at about 40% including water use from illegal connections;
* inappropriate pipe materials such as [[asbestos-cement]] used for older pipes;
* a lack of qualified personnel;
* widespread poverty; and
* traditional social norms especially concerning the role of women.

The latter make it hard, for example, to read meters within premises or to involve women in participatory processes.

In urban areas, additional challenges include:
* delays in the procurement of large works, due to a large extent to the absence of contractors with sufficient capacity to execute large works;
* the [[groundwater pollution|pollution of shallow groundwater]] because of a lack of sanitation; and
* poor service quality of piped water supply, including service interruptions that are partly caused by unreliable electricity supply.

== Access and service quality ==

===Overview===
[[File:Shiring Tagab village dug well - reduced.JPG|thumb|left|A dug well along a road in the [[Faryab Province]] of [[Afghanistan]]. Because of the risk of contamination open wells such as this one are not considered as an [[improved water source]], the measure used by the UN to measure the achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goal]]s.]]
In 2015, 55% of the population had access to "improved" water, 78% and 47%, in urban and rural areas, respectively. Still, in that year, 14 million people were without access to "improved" water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://washwatch.org/en/countries/afghanistan/summary/statistics/|title=WASHwatch.org -      Afghanistan|website=washwatch.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation&lt;/ref&gt; Access to an improved water source does not mean that the water is safe to drink. For example, protected shallow wells in urban areas are often contaminated with bacteria. Piped water supply can also be contaminated. Households without access to an improved source take water from streams and rivers, open wells and unprotected springs, all of which are also often polluted. In rural areas women and girls walk long distances to fetch water.

[[File:Afghan Returnees Find Home in Parwan Province.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[hand pump]] in [[Parwan Province]], which is very common in most parts of Afghanistan.]]
There have been considerable improvements in access to water supply in the last several years. A countrywide [[Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey]] carried out during the reign of the Taliban in 1997 found that an estimated 7% of the rural population and 17% of the urban population had access to an improved water source at the time.&lt;ref name="JMP"/&gt; While the survey results represent estimates that have a certain margin of error, the recorded improvements in rural areas match the fact that significant investments were undertaken by [[NGO]]s and by the government under the National Solidarity Program initiated in 2003. The improvements in urban areas are somewhat puzzling, since no major investments in water supply systems took place during that period in Kabul and Kandahar. Possibly the 1997 figure does not include the urban population served by public wells. Furthermore, service quality, which is often poor, is not reflected in the above figures. For example, because of poor electrical service, serious voltage fluctuations, poor installation of equipment and lack of preventive maintenance, pump failures are frequent and lead to supply interruptions.&lt;ref&gt;USAID:[http://afghanistan.usaid.gov/en/USAID/Article/1127/Customer_Service_The_Key_to_Success Customer Service the Key to Success], 13 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the mortality rate of children under 5 was as high as 25%. Half of these deaths were caused by [[water-borne disease]]s. Household surveys indicated that spending on health care was second only to food.&lt;ref name="WB RWSSP 1"/&gt;

===Kabul===
[[File:Kabul Hills.jpg|thumb|left|Settlements on hills in the city of [[Kabul]]. Most of these residents have no access to piped water supply so they pay the many "water carriers" whose job is delivering water to homes everyday.]]
As of 2005, about half a million people or 15% of the population of [[Kabul]] were connected to the piped water supply system through an estimated 30,000 house connections. Some of those who are not connected receive water from their neighbors or from public hand pumps, both of which are considered as [[improved water source]]s. Many Kabul residents get their water from up to 100,000 shallow private wells that are often polluted and vulnerable to drought.&lt;ref&gt;Pier Giorgio Nembrini:[http://thirstycitiesinwar.com/files/kabuloccasionalpaper7.pdf Geneva Foundation. Cities in war:thirsty cities, Kabul water supply: evolution since the 1992-94 civil war], October 2002&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[United States Geological Survey]] study carried out from 2005 to 2007, about a quarter of shallow wells have fallen dry. Roughly 40% of the remaining wells could fall seasonally or permanently dry because of increased withdrawals, if they are not deepened. Reduced water availability because of the impacts of climate change could further exacerbate the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, T.J., Akbari, M.A., Ashoor, M.H., Chornack, M.P., Coplen, T.B., Emerson, D.G., Hubbard, B.E., Litke, D.W., Michel, R.L., Plummer, L.N., Rezai, M.T., Senay, G.B., Verdin, J.P., and Verstraeten, I.M., 2010, [http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2009/5262/pdf/sir2009-5262_front-text_508_Pt2_33-74.pdf Conceptual model of water resources in the Kabul Basin, Afghanistan], U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2009–5262, p. 65 and 70f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The public piped water supply system provides about 60,000 cubic meter of water per day through separate piped networks in 2005 from three different sources:
* The Logar River aquifer south-east of the city;
* The Afshar well field drawing from the Paghman River aquifer to the west;
* The Alaudin well field drawing from the Upper Kabul Aquifer to the south.

In addition, a small part of the city is connected to a distribution system served by the Qargha [[Karez]]. However, this traditional water supply system had fallen dry in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;D. Banks with contributions by M.H. Hamid, Norwegian Church Aid: [http://www.cphd.af/Downloads/All%20Water%20Related%20Reports/Water%20General/Water%20assessment%20mission.PDF Water Assessment Mission to Afghanistan, January-February 2002, Part F. Urban Water Supply Systems in Afghanistan], posted on the website of the Center for Policy and Human Development at Kabul University&lt;/ref&gt;

Water supply to those fortunate enough to be connected was about 100 liter per capita per-day, assuming 15 people per connection and one third of physical water losses in the distribution network. This per capita water use is almost as high as in Germany. However, water quality is poor, supply is intermittent and the great majority who do not have access to the piped network have to get by with much less water. The Kabul water project aimed at tripling the number of house connections to 90,000 and doubling water production from existing well fields as well as from a new well field on the Lower Kabul River aquifer, providing water to more than 600,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Beller / IGIP / BETS: [http://www.bgr.bund.de/cln_178/nn_332802/EN/Themen/Wasser/Projekte/TZ/TZ__Afghanistan/kabul__water__conference__extension__water__supply__pdf,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/kabul_water_conference_extension_water_supply_pdf.pdf Water for Kabul], August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kabul water project was to be financed by both KfW (well field extension and reservoir) and the World Bank (transmission line, distribution network, house connections and meters).&lt;ref&gt;World Bank:[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/04/03/000090341_20060403120633/Rendered/PDF/35745.pdf Afghanistan Urban Water Sector Project], Project Information Document, March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The project was supposed to be completed in 2010. However, the World Bank withdrew from the project because of disputes over procurement.

===Kandahar===
In [[Kandahar]] there is only one network supplied by three or four deep wells. In 2002, it delivered only 2,500 cubic meter per-day to a city of nearly half a million. Most of the population depends on polluted shallow wells that are at risk of running dry. For irrigation purposes the population of Kandahar depends on the [[Dahla Dam]] north of the city.

===Herat===
As of 2012 [[Herat]] had more than 39,000 house connections, all of which are equipped with meters. About 45 percent of the population in the service area of the water company had access to piped water supply, including 85 percent in the city itself and around 30 percent in the surrounding areas. Since 2008, the local public water company – officially called a "strategic business unit" of the national water company - has been operating at a profit. The profit is reinvested in infrastructure. According to the German development agency GIZ, the service of the Herat water utility "can be compared to similar set-ups in industrialised countries."&lt;ref name="GTZ"/&gt; With 105 employees in 2013 the water utility is not overstaffed; its ratio of 2.5 employees per 1,000 connections corresponds to international good practice. The utility receives its water from wells. About half the wells are within the city and the other half in the outskirts. Drinking water quality is not systematically monitored. According to a non-representative survey carried out in 2013, two thirds of customers receive only intermittent water supply with interruptions of up to one and a half days, one third indicated that the amount of water received - 60 liter per capita per day on average - was insufficient, one third said that their water meters had not been read for at least the last six months, and almost all complained about insufficient water pressure. The water company collects only  about 75 percent of the total amount of water billed. With German financing a new well field, transmission line and storage facilities were completed in 2008. The additional water quantity allowed to quadruple the number of house connections between 2002 and 2012. The new well field has also improved water quality, according to residents surveyed. Households not connected to the piped network use shallow wells or water vendors.&lt;ref name="KfW Herat"&gt;KfW:Herat Drinking Water Supply, Ex-post evaluation, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Salma Dam]] was built in [[Herat Province]] construction finished 4 of June 2016.

===Kunduz===
In [[Kunduz]] water supply improved substantially since 2007. From April 2007 until December 2009 the number of connections increased from 370 to 2,100, providing piped water supply to about one third of the city. The network was expanded from 14 to 71&amp;nbsp;km. A new computer-aided accounting system is being introduced to help increase the share of bills paid. In 2008, for the first time revenues covered operating costs.&lt;ref name="GTZ"/&gt; Residents of Kunduz rely on water from the [[Kunduz] and [Khanabad] Rivers] for irrigation purposes.

===Lashkar Gah===
It was announced in 2005 that a [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]]-funded project would build six reservoirs in [[Lashkar Gah]], with responsibility for the water supply then being handed over to the [[Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority]]. The city had been without fresh water for the previous 30 years due to the contamination of the [[Helmand River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://reliefweb.int/node/170220 USAID Field Report Afghanistan Feb 2005] ReliefWeb&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Lashkar Gah rely on the [[Kajaki Dam]] for irrigation, which is located near by in the [[Kajaki District]] of [[Helmand Province]].

== Responsibility for water supply ==

=== Responsibilities within the government ===
[[File:AF-water-power.jpg|thumb|Building of the [[Ministry of Water and Energy (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Water and Energy]] in 2002.]]
Policy setting and the channeling of resources provided by external donors for water supply investments is the responsibility of at least five Afghan Ministries.

* The [[Cabinet of Afghanistan|Ministry of Urban Development Affairs]] is responsible for urban water supply. As of 2012, the Minister was Hasan Abdullahi, who previously worked in senior positions in the same Ministry and who is a graduate of the [[University of Tehran]].
* The [[Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development]] is responsible for rural water supply. As of 2012, the Minister was Wais Ahmad Barmak, formerly Deputy Minister in the same Ministry and a graduate of the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] in London.
* The [[Ministry of Water and Energy (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Water and Energy]] is responsible for water resources management. Since 2005 the Minister is [[Ismail Khan]], a former [[warlord]] and governor of Herat Province.
* The [[Ministry of Finance (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Finance]] is, together with the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, responsible for the National Solidarity Fund, which is the major program for rural water supply in the country. As of 2012, the Minister was [[Omar Zakhilwal]].
* The [[Ministry of Public Health (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Public Health]] undertakes programs to train women to educate the population about the importance of hygiene and clean water in preventing disease.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF:[http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/index_9068.html UNICEF and Afghan Ministry of Health combat disease by recruiting women to teach], May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, the Minister was [[Suraya Dalil]].

=== Service provision in urban areas ===
The government has a policy of creating decentralized local public utilities run on the basis of commercial principles. Prior to 2007 there was a Central Authority for Water Supply and Sewerage (CAWSS) with provincial water departments in the 14 Afghan towns that had piped water supply systems. The entity did not perform well and was not run on the basis of private sector principles. As part of sector reforms the agency was dissolved and replaced by the Afghan Water Supply and Sewerage Corporation (AUWSSC), a holding company for local utilities called "Strategic Business Units" that are to be run based on commercial principles. As of 2010, the utility in Herat (see above) was probably the Corporation’s best-run strategic business unit in the country.

There are few qualified technical staff due to low salaries and poor working environments. Most of the staff working on projects are funded by donors and leave once a project ends.&lt;ref name="WB RWSSP 17"&gt;World Bank:[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2010/08/10/000333038_20100810035920/Rendered/PDF/ICR13650P091031Official0Use0Only191.pdf Afghanistan Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project], Implementation Completion Report, June 25, 2010, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are encouraging exceptions. For example, a brother-and-sister team in the city of [[Ghazni]] increased revenue collection from water tariffs by 75%, aided by the fact that meters located within premises can only be read by a woman if no man is in the house.&lt;ref&gt;USAID: [http://afghanistan.usaid.gov/en/USAID/Article/1038/Female_Meter_Reader_Raises_Revenues Female Meter Reader Raises Revenues], 9 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service provision in rural areas===
[[File:Afghanistan - Mazaar - tube well.JPG|thumb|Hand pump providing water in [[Balkh Province]]]]
NGOs play a major role in providing water supply and sanitation in rural areas of Afghanistan. In 2003, through its Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD), the Government began to play a role in rural water supply. It developed a "Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Policy/Strategy" for Afghanistan. The strategy emphasizes the integration of health and hygiene education with water supply and sanitation and gives local communities a key role. They are supposed to decide about the type of infrastructure to be installed, finance part of its investment costs, and to operate and maintain it.&lt;ref name="WB RWSSP 1"&gt;World Bank:[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2010/08/10/000333038_20100810035920/Rendered/PDF/ICR13650P091031Official0Use0Only191.pdf Afghanistan Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project], Implementation Completion Report, June 25, 2010, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; This is to be done through democratically elected Community Development Councils (CDCs) that have been created throughout Afghanistan since 2003 as part of the National Solidarity Programme. The councils receive so-called block grants and are themselves in charge of choosing what to do with the block grants and selecting the companies that install the infrastructure. About 22,000 Councils have been created in all of Afghanistan's provinces as of 2010. About one quarter of the projects financed through the National Solidarity Programme are for water supply, sanitation and flood control, amounting to 11,700 projects with a value of US$157m financed between 2003 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank: [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2010/06/23/000334955_20100623022629/Rendered/PDF/545400PJPR0P11101Official0Use0Only1.pdf Third Emergency National Solidarity Project], Emergency Project Paper, June 2010, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Councils have limited to no technical skills in water engineering. Provincial Rural Rehabilitation and Development (PRRD) units provide technical assistance to the CDCs during the planning and construction phase, hiring social mobilizers to consult with communities and to appoint caretakers to ensure operation and maintenance. But the technical support to the Councils is often insufficient. According to a 2010 World Bank report, the quality of hand pumps installed is sometimes inferior, making them more prone to break down. The PRRDs have no mandate or means to support CDCs in case of major repairs or rehabilitation. “Capacity at the province or districts to support such maintenance or rehabilitation is almost nonexistent due to lack of tools, staff, and funding”, says a 2010 World Bank report.&lt;ref name="WB RWSSP 17"/&gt;

==External cooperation==
The main external partners in the water sector are Germany, the United States and the World Bank.

=== Germany ===
Germany provides financial cooperation through [[KfW]] development bank,&lt;ref&gt;KfW:[http://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/EN_Home/Countries,_Programmes_and_Projects/Asia/Afghanistan/Priority_areas_of_cooperation.jsp Afghanistan – Improved Basic Services for the Population], June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; as well as technical assistance through [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|GIZ]]&lt;ref name="GTZ"&gt;GTZ:[http://www.gtz.de/en/dokumente/en-factsheet-wasser-afghanistan.pdf Water – a source of life.Improving water supplies in Afghanistan], May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources]], BGR. German cooperation in the water sector is focused on urban areas, in particular on Kabul and Herat, as well as Balkh, Kunduz, Takhar and Badakhshan provinces in Northern and Northeastern Afghanistan. BGR supported groundwater monitoring and modeling in the Kabul basin as well as training of local partners from 2003 to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;BGR:[http://www.bgr.bund.de/cln_178/nn_337364/EN/Themen/TZ/TechnZusammenarb/Projekte/Nicht__mehr__in__Projektliste__aufgefuehrt__en/afghanistan__grundwasserschutz__en.html?__nnn=true Afghanistan - Improvement of groundwater-protection to prevent droughts in the Kabul Basin]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Through USAID, the United States supports urban water supply through the Commercialization of Afghanistan Water and Sanitation Activity (CAWSA) project since 2008. USAID works mainly in the northern Afghan city of [[Mazar-e-Sharif]], [[Gardez]] and [[Ghazni]] in the east as well as [[Jalalabad]].&lt;ref&gt;USAID Afghanistan:[http://afghanistan.usaid.gov/en/programs/infrastructure Infrastructure]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Bank ===
The main vehicle for [[World Bank]] support to water supply in Afghanistan is the National Solidarity Programme (see above under rural water supply), using funds from various countries channeled through the International Development Association or the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank:[http://www.worldbank.org.af/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/AFGHANISTANEXTN/0,,contentMDK:21846299~pagePK:141137~piPK:141127~theSitePK:305985,00.html Afghanistan National Solidarity Program]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in 2006 the World Bank approved a US$40m grant to support an urban water supply project to improve water supply in Kabul. However, by 2010 almost no funds were disbursed and the infrastructure component of the project had been cancelled. It is now to be replaced by a pilot project to support small private operators, connecting 500 customers in one area of Kabul.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank:[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/SAR/2010/11/10/E890C3DF854483A8852577D700655CA1/1_0/Rendered/PDF/P0878600ISR0Di011020101289413628437.pdf Implementation Status &amp; Results, Afghanistan Urban Water Sector Project], October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
