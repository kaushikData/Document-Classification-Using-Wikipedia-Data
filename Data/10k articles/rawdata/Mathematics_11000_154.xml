      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8122">If X is a manifold with an action of a topological group G by analytical diffeomorphisms, the notion of a '''(G, X)-structure''' on a [[topological space]] is a way to formalise it being locally isomorphic to X with its G-invariant structure; spaces with a (G, X)-structures are always [[manifold]]s and are called '''(G, X)-manifolds'''. This notion is often used with G being a [[Lie group]] and X a [[homogeneous space]] for G. Foundational examples are [[hyperbolic manifold]]s and [[affine manifold]]s.

== Definition and examples ==

=== Formal definition ===

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Connectedness (topology)|connected]] [[differential manifold]] and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a subgroup of the group of [[diffeomorphism]]s of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; which act analytically in the following sense:

:if &lt;math&gt;g_1, g_2 \in G&lt;/math&gt; and there is an open subset &lt;math&gt;U \subset X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g_1, g_2&lt;/math&gt; are equal when restricted to &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;g_1 = g_2&lt;/math&gt;

(this definition is inspired by the analytic continuation property of analytic diffeomorphisms on an [[analytic manifold]]).

A &lt;math&gt;(G, X)&lt;/math&gt;-structure on a topological space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a [[manifold]] structure on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; whose [[Atlas (topology)|atlas]]' charts has values in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and [[Atlas (topology)#Transition maps|transition maps]] belong to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. This means that there exists:

*a covering of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; by open sets &lt;math&gt;U_i, i \in I&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;M = \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i&lt;/math&gt;);
*open [[embedding]]s &lt;math&gt;\phi_i : U_i \to X&lt;/math&gt; called charts;

such that every transition map &lt;math&gt;\phi_i \circ \phi_j^{-1} : \phi_j(U_i\cap U_j) \to \phi_i(U_i \cap U_j)&lt;/math&gt; is the restriction of a diffeomorphism in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

Two such structures &lt;math&gt;(U_i, \phi_i), (V_j, \psi_j)&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent when they are contained in a maximal one, equivalently when their union is also a &lt;math&gt;(G, X)&lt;/math&gt; structure (i.e. the maps &lt;math&gt;\phi_i \circ \psi_j^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi_j \circ \phi_i^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; are restrictions of diffeomorphisms in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;).

=== Riemannian examples ===

If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Lie group]] and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; a [[Riemannian manifold]] with a [[faithful action]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; by [[Isometry (Riemannian geometry)|isometries]] then the action is analytic. Usually one takes &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to be the full isometry group of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then the category of  &lt;math&gt;(G, X)&lt;/math&gt; manifolds is equivalent to the category of Riemannian manifolds which are locally isometric to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. every point has a neighbourhood isometric to an open subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;).

Often the examples of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] under &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, for example one can take &lt;math&gt;X = G&lt;/math&gt; with a left-invariant metric. A particularly simple example is &lt;math&gt;X = \R^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; the group of [[Euclidean isometry|euclidean isometries]]. Then a &lt;math&gt;(G,X)&lt;/math&gt; manifold is simply a [[flat manifold]].

A particularly interesting example is when &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a Riemannian [[symmetric space]], for example [[hyperbolic space]]. The simplest such example is the [[hyperbolic plane]], whose isometry group is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;G = \mathrm{PGL}_2(\R)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Pseudo-Riemannian examples ===

When &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is [[Minkowski space]] and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; the [[Lorentz group]] the notion of a &lt;math&gt;(G, X)&lt;/math&gt;-structure is the same as that of a flat [[Lorentzian manifold]].

=== Other examples ===

When &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the affine space and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; the group of affine transformations then one gets the notion of an [[affine manifold]].

When &lt;math&gt;X = \mathbb P^n(\R)&lt;/math&gt; is the n-dimensional real [[projective space]] and &lt;math&gt;G = \mathrm{PGL}_n(\R)&lt;/math&gt; one gets the notion of a projective structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dumas |first=David |editor-last=Papadopoulos |editor-first=Athanase |title=Handbook of Teichm√ºller theory, Volume II |publisher=European MAth. soc. |date=2009 |pages= |chapter=Complex projective structures }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developing map and completeness ==

=== Developing map ===

Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;(G,X)&lt;/math&gt;-manifold which is connected (as a topological space). The developing map is a map from the [[universal cover]] &lt;math&gt;\tilde M&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; which is only well-defined up to composition by an element of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

A developing map is defined as follows:{{sfn|Thurston|1997|loc=Chapter 3.4}} fix &lt;math&gt;p\in \tilde M&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;q \in \tilde M&lt;/math&gt; be any other point, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; a path from &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\phi:  U \to X&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a small enough neighbourhood of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;) a map obtained by composing a chart of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; with the projection &lt;math&gt;\tilde M \to M&lt;/math&gt;. We may use analytic continuation along &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; to extend &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; so that its domain includes &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\tilde M&lt;/math&gt; is [[simply connected space|simply connected]] the value of &lt;math&gt;\phi(q)&lt;/math&gt; thus obtained does not depend on the original choice of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, and we call the (well-defined) map &lt;math&gt;\phi: \tilde M \to X&lt;/math&gt; a ''developing map'' for the &lt;math&gt;(G,X)&lt;/math&gt;-structure. It depends on the choice of base point and chart, but only up to composition by an element of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Monodromy ===

Given a developing map &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, the ''monodromy'' or ''holonomy''{{sfn|Thurston|1997|p=141}} of a &lt;math&gt;(G,X)&lt;/math&gt;-structure is the unique morphism &lt;math&gt;h : \pi_1(M) \to G&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies

:&lt;math&gt; \forall \gamma \in \pi_1(M), p\in \tilde M : \phi(\gamma\cdot p) = h(\gamma)\cdot \phi(p)&lt;/math&gt;.

It depends on the choice of a developing map but only up to an [[inner automorphism]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Complete (G,X)-structures ===

A &lt;math&gt;(G,X)&lt;/math&gt; structure is said to be ''complete'' if it has a developing map which is also a [[covering map]] (this does not depend on the choice of developing map since they differ by a diffeomorphism). For example, if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is simply connected the structure is complete if and only if the developing map is a diffeomorphism.

=== Examples ===

==== Riemannian (G,X)-structures ====

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a Riemannian manifold and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; its full group of isometry, then a &lt;math&gt;(G,X)&lt;/math&gt;-structure is complete if and only if the underlying Riemannian manifold is [[Riemannian manifold#Geodesic completeness|geodesically complete]] (equivalently metrically complete). In particular, in this case if the underlying space of a &lt;math&gt;(G,X)&lt;/math&gt;-manifold is compact then the latter is automatically complete.

In the case where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the hyperbolic plane the developing map is the same map as given by the [[Uniformisation Theorem]].

==== Other cases ====

In general compactness of the space does not imply completeness of a &lt;math&gt;(G,X)&lt;/math&gt;-structure. For example, an affine structure on the torus is complete if and only if the monodromy map has its image inside the [[Translation (geometry)|translations]]. But there are many affine tori which do not satisfy this condition, for example any quadrilateral with its opposite sides glued by an affine map yields an affine structure on the torus, which is complete if and only if the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

Interesting examples of complete, noncompact affine manifolds are given by the Margulis spacetimes.

== (G,X)-structures as connections ==
{{Main article | Ehresmann connection}}

In the work of [[Charles Ehresmann]] &lt;math&gt;(G, X)&lt;/math&gt;-structures on a manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; are viewed as flat [[Ehresmann connection]]s on [[fiber bundle]]s with fiber &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, whose [[monodromy]] maps lie in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

'''11''' ('''eleven''') is the [[natural number]] following [[10 (number)|10]] and preceding [[12 (number)|12]]. It is the first [[repdigit]]. In English, it is the smallest positive integer requiring three syllables and the largest prime number with a single-morpheme name.

{{anchor|Etymology}}

==Name==
Eleven derives from the [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|ƒôndleofon}}'' which is first attested in [[Bede]]'s late 9th-century ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]''.{{refn|Specifically, in the line ''{{lang|ang|jjvjv √∞√¶t rice h√¶fde endleofan wintra.}}''&lt;ref&gt;[[Bede]], ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People|Eccl. Hist.]]'', Bk. V, Ch. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; It has cognates in every [[Germanic language]] (for example, German ''elf''), whose [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ancestor has been [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as *''ainalifa-'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kroonen|first1=Guus|title=Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Germanic|date=2013|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=978-90-04-18340-7|page=11f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the prefix *''aina-'' (adjectival "[[1 (number)|one]]") and suffix *''-lifa-'' of uncertain meaning.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; It is sometimes compared with the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''{{lang|lt|vien√∫olika}}'', although ''{{lang|lt|-lika}}'' is used as the suffix for all numbers from 11 to 19 (analogous to "-teen").&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

The [[Old English]] form has closer cognates in [[Old Frisian]], [[Old Saxon|Saxon]], and [[Old Norse|Norse]], whose ancestor has been reconstructed as *''ainlifun''. This has formerly been considered derived from Proto-Germanic *''tehun'' ("[[10 (number)|ten]]");&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Dantzig |first=Tobias |date=1930 |title=Number: The Language of Science }}.&lt;/ref&gt; it is now sometimes connected with *''leik ∑-'' or *''leip-'' ("left; remaining"), with the implicit meaning that "one is left" after having already counted to ten.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st ed. "eleven, ''adj.'' and ''n.''" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In languages==

===Grammar===
While, as mentioned above, 11 has its own name in Germanic languages such as English, German, and Swedish. It is the first compound number in many other languages, e.g., Italian ''√πndici'' (but in Spanish and Portuguese, 16, and in French, 17 is the first compound number), Chinese ÂçÅ‰∏Ä ''sh√≠ yƒ´'', Korean Ïó¥Ìïú ''yeol han''.

==In mathematics==
11 is a [[prime number]]. It is the smallest two-digit prime number in the [[decimal]] [[radix|base]].

The next prime is [[13 (number)|13]], with which it comprises a [[twin prime]].

If a number is divisible by 11, reversing its digits will result in another multiple of 11. As long as no two adjacent digits of a number added together exceed 9, then multiplying the number by 11, reversing the digits of the product, and dividing that new number by 11, will yield a number that is the reverse of the original number. (For example: 142,312 √ó 11 = 1,565,432 ‚Üí 2,345,651 √∑ 11 = 213,241.)

Multiples of 11 by one-digit numbers all have matching double digits: 00 (=0), 11, 22, 33, 44, etc.

An 11-sided [[polygon]] is called a [[hendecagon|hendecagon or undecagon]].

There are 11 [[List of convex uniform tilings|regular and semiregular convex uniform tilings]] in the second dimension, and 11 [[List of convex uniform tilings|planigons]] that correspond to these 11 regular and semiregular tilings.

In base 10, there is a simple test to determine if an integer is divisible by 11: take every digit of the number located in odd position and add them up, then take the remaining digits and add them up. If the difference between the two sums is a multiple of 11, including 0, then the number is divisible by 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Number Story: From Counting to Cryptography |last=Higgins |first=Peter |year=2008 |publisher=Copernicus |location=New York |isbn=978-1-84800-000-1 |page=47 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if the number is 65,637 then (6 + 6 + 7) - (5 + 3) = 19 - 8 = 11, so 65,637 is divisible by 11. This technique also works with groups of digits rather than individual digits, so long as the number of digits in each group is odd, although not all groups have to have the same number of digits. For instance, if one uses three digits in each group, one gets from 65,637 the calculation (065) - 637 = -572, which is divisible by 11.

Another test for divisibility is to separate a number into groups of two consecutive digits (adding a leading zero if there is an odd number of digits), and then add up the numbers so formed; if the result is divisible by 11, the number is divisible by 11. For instance, if the number is 65,637, 06 + 56 + 37 = 99, which is divisible by 11, so 65,637 is divisible by eleven. This also works by adding a trailing zero instead of a leading one: 65 + 63 + 70 = 198, which is divisible by 11. This also works with larger groups of digits, providing that each group has an even number of digits (not all groups have to have the same number of digits).

An easy way of [[Multiplication|multiplying]] numbers by 11 in base 10 is:
If the number has:
*1 digit - Replicate the digit (so 2 x 11 becomes 22).
*2 digits - Add the 2 digits together and place the result in the middle (so 47 x 11 becomes 4 (11) 7 or 4 (10+1) 7 or (4+1) 1 7 or 517).
*3 digits - Keep the first digit in its place for the result's first digit, add the first and second digits together to form the result's second digit, add the second and third digits together to form the result's third digit, and keep the third digit as the result's fourth digit. For any resulting numbers greater than 9, carry the 1 to the left. Example 1: 123 x 11 becomes 1 (1+2) (2+3) 3 or 1353. Example 2: 481 x 11 becomes 4 (4+8) (8+1) 1 or 4 (10+2) 9 1 or (4+1) 2 9 1 or 5291.
*4 or more digits - Follow the same pattern as for 3 digits.

In base 13 and higher bases (such as [[hexadecimal]]), 11 is represented as B, where ten is A. In [[duodecimal]], however, 11 is sometimes represented as E and ten as T or X.

There are 11 orthogonal curvilinear [[coordinate systems]] (to within a conformal symmetry) in which the 3-variable [[Helmholtz equation]] can be solved using the [[separation of variables]] technique.

See also [[11-cell]].

11 of the thirty-five [[hexominoes]] can be folded to form cubes. 11 of the sixty-six [[octiamonds]] can be folded to form octahedra.

11 is the fourth [[Sophie Germain prime]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005384|title=Sloane's A005384 : Sophie Germain primes|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the third [[safe prime]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005385|title=Sloane's A005385 : Safe primes|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the fourth [[Lucas prime]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005479|title=Sloane's A005479 : Prime Lucas numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first [[repunit prime]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A004022|title=Sloane's A004022 : Primes of the form (10^n - 1)/9|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second [[good prime]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A028388|title=Sloane's A028388 : Good primes|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second [[unique prime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/search?q=unique+prime|title=Sloane's A040017 : Unique period primes (no other prime has same period as 1/p) in order (periods are given in A051627)|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is necessary for ''n'' to be prime for 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 to be a [[Mersenne prime]], the [[converse (logic)|converse]] is not true: 2&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 = 2047 which is 23&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;89.

11 raised to the nth power is the nth row of Pascal's Triangle. (This works for any base, but the number eleven must be changed to the number represented as 11 in that base; for example, in duodecimal this must be done using thirteen.)

11 is a [[Heegner number]], meaning that the [[ring of integers]] of the [[Field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-11})&lt;/math&gt; has the property of [[Unique factorization domain|unique factorization]].

One consequence of this is that there exists at most one point on the elliptic curve x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 11 that has positive-integer coordinates. In this case, this unique point is ([[15 (number)|15]], [[58 (number)|58]]).

==In religion==

===Christianity===
After [[Judas Iscariot]] was disgraced, the remaining [[twelve Apostles|apostles]] of [[Jesus]] were sometimes described as "the Eleven" ({{bibleverse||Mark|16:11|NKJV}}; {{bibleverse||Luke|24:9|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|24:33|NKJV}}); this occurred even after [[Saint Matthias|Matthias]] was added to bring the number to twelve, as in Acts 2:14:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.cc/acts/2-14.htm|title=Acts 2:14 Then Peter stood up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and addressed the crowd: "Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen carefully to my words.|author=|date=|website=bible.cc}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Saint Peter|Peter]] stood up with the eleven'' ([[New International Version]]). The [[New Living Translation]] says ''Peter stepped forward with the eleven other apostles'', making clear that the number of apostles was now twelve.

[[Saint Ursula]] is said to have been martyred in the third or fourth century in [[Cologne]] with a number of companions, whose reported number "varies from five to eleven".&lt;ref&gt;Ursulines of the Roman Union, Province of Southern Africa, [http://www.ursulines.org.za/stursulacompanions.html St. Ursula and Companions], accessed 10 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; A legend that Ursula died with eleven thousand virgin companions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ladylever/collections/paintings/gallery1/stursula.aspx ''Four scenes from the life of St Ursula''], accessed 10 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; has been thought to appear from misreading ''XI.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17013">In [[calculus]], '''absolute continuity''' is a smoothness property of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s that is stronger than [[continuous function|continuity]] and [[uniform continuity]]. The notion of absolute continuity allows one to obtain generalizations of the relationship between the two central operations of [[calculus]]‚Äî[[derivative|differentiation]] and [[integral|integration]]. This relationship is commonly characterized (by the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]) in the framework of [[Riemann integration]], but with absolute continuity it may be formulated in terms of [[Lebesgue integration]]. For real-valued functions on the [[real line]] two interrelated notions appear: ''absolute continuity of functions'' and ''absolute continuity of measures.'' These two notions are generalized in different directions. The usual derivative of a function is related to the ''[[Radon‚ÄìNikodym derivative]]'', or ''density'', of a measure.

We have the following chains of inclusions for functions over a [[compact space|compact]] subset of the real line:

: '''[[absolutely continuous]]''' ‚äÜ '''[[uniformly continuous]]''' = '''[[Continuous function|continuous]]'''&lt;!--All continuous functions on a compact domain are uniformly continuous--&gt;

and:

: '''[[continuously differentiable]]''' ‚äÜ '''[[Lipschitz continuous]]''' ‚äÜ '''[[absolutely continuous]]''' ‚äÜ '''[[bounded variation]]'''  ‚äÜ '''[[Differentiable function|differentiable]] [[almost everywhere]]'''

==Absolute continuity of functions==

A continuous function fails to be absolutely continuous if it fails to be [[uniformly continuous]], which can happen if the domain of the function is not compact ‚Äì examples are tan(''x'') over &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;0,&amp;nbsp;{{pi}}/2&lt;nowiki&gt;)&lt;/nowiki&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; over the entire real line, and sin(1/''x'') over (0, 1]. But a continuous function ''f'' can fail to be absolutely continuous even on a compact interval. It may not be "differentiable almost everywhere" (like the [[Weierstrass function]], which is not differentiable anywhere). Or it may be [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] almost everywhere and its derivative ''f''&amp;nbsp;‚Ä≤ may be [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integrable]], but the integral of ''f''&amp;nbsp;‚Ä≤ differs from the increment of ''f'' (how much ''f'' changes over an interval). This happens for example with the [[Cantor function]].

===Definition===
Let &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; be an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] in the [[real line]] &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt;. A function &lt;math&gt;f\colon I \to \R&lt;/math&gt; is '''absolutely continuous''' on &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; if for every positive number &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, there is a positive number &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; such that whenever a finite sequence of [[pairwise disjoint]] sub-intervals &lt;math&gt;(x_k, y_k)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x_k,y_k\in I&lt;/math&gt; satisfies&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Royden|1988|loc=Sect. 5.4, page 108}}; {{harvnb|Nielsen|1997|loc=Definition 15.6 on page 251}}; {{harvnb|Athreya|Lahiri|2006|loc=Definitions 4.4.1, 4.4.2 on pages 128,129}}. The interval &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be bounded and closed in the former two books but not the latter book.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_k (y_k - x_k) &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_k | f(y_k) - f(x_k) | &lt; \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

The collection of all absolutely continuous functions on &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{AC}(I)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Equivalent definitions===

The following conditions on a real-valued function ''f'' on a compact interval [''a'',''b''] are equivalent:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nielsen|1997|loc=Theorem 20.8 on page 354}}; also {{harvnb|Royden|1988|loc=Sect. 5.4, page 110}} and {{harvnb|Athreya|Lahiri|2006|loc=Theorems 4.4.1, 4.4.2 on pages 129,130}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:(1) ''f'' is absolutely continuous;

:(2) ''f'' has a derivative ''f''&amp;nbsp;‚Ä≤ [[almost everywhere]], the derivative is Lebesgue integrable, and
:: &lt;math&gt; f(x) = f(a) + \int_a^x f'(t) \, dt &lt;/math&gt;
:for all ''x'' on [''a'',''b''];

:(3) there exists a Lebesgue integrable function ''g'' on [''a'',''b''] such that
:: &lt;math&gt; f(x) = f(a) + \int_a^x g(t) \, dt &lt;/math&gt;
:for all ''x'' in [''a'',''b''].

If these equivalent conditions are satisfied then necessarily ''g'' = ''f''&amp;nbsp;‚Ä≤ almost everywhere.

Equivalence between (1) and (3) is known as the '''fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integral calculus''', due to [[Lebesgue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Athreya|Lahiri|2006|loc=before Theorem 4.4.1 on page 129}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For an equivalent definition in terms of measures see the section [[#Relation between the two notions of absolute continuity|Relation between the two notions of absolute continuity]].

===Properties===
* The sum and difference of two absolutely continuous functions are also absolutely continuous. If the two functions are defined on a bounded closed interval, then their product is also absolutely continuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Royden|1988|loc=Problem 5.14(a,b) on page 111}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* If an absolutely continuous function is defined on a bounded closed interval and is nowhere zero then its reciprocal is absolutely continuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Royden|1988|loc=Problem 5.14(c) on page 111}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Every absolutely continuous function is [[uniform continuity|uniformly continuous]] and, therefore, [[Continuous function|continuous]]. Every [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz-continuous]] [[function (mathematics)|function]] is absolutely continuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Royden|1988|loc=Problem 5.20(a) on page 112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* If ''f'': [''a'',''b''] ‚Üí '''R''' is absolutely continuous, then it is of [[bounded variation]] on [''a'',''b''].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Royden|1988|loc=Lemma 5.11 on page 108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*  If ''f'': [''a'',''b''] ‚Üí '''R''' is absolutely continuous, then it can be written as the difference of two monotonic nondecreasing absolutely continuous functions on [''a'',''b''].
* If ''f'': [''a'',''b''] ‚Üí '''R''' is absolutely continuous, then it has the [[Luzin N property|Luzin ''N'' property]] (that is, for any &lt;math&gt;L \subseteq [a,b]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\lambda(L)=0&lt;/math&gt;, it holds that &lt;math&gt;\lambda(f(L))=0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; stands for the [[Lebesgue measure]] on '''R''').
* ''f'': ''I'' ‚Üí '''R''' is absolutely continuous if and only if it is continuous, is of bounded variation and has the Luzin ''N'' property.

===Examples===
The following functions are uniformly continuous but '''not''' absolutely continuous:
* the [[Cantor function]] on [0, 1];
* the function
::&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases} 0, &amp; \text{if }x =0 \\ x \sin(1/x), &amp; \text{if } x \neq 0 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;
: on a finite interval containing the origin.

The following functions are absolutely continuous but not Œ±-H√∂lder continuous:
* the function ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;''x&lt;sup&gt;Œ≤&lt;/sup&gt;'' on [0,&amp;nbsp;c], for any 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;Œ≤&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;Œ±&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1

The following functions are absolutely continuous and [[H√∂lder condition|Œ±-H√∂lder continuous]] but not [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz continuous]]:
* the function ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;{{radic|''x''}} on [0,&amp;nbsp;c], for Œ±&amp;nbsp;‚â§&amp;nbsp;1/2.

===Generalizations===
Let (''X'', ''d'') be a [[metric space]] and let ''I'' be an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] in the [[real line]] '''R'''. A function ''f'': ''I'' ‚Üí ''X'' is '''absolutely continuous''' on ''I'' if for every positive number &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, there is a positive number &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; such that whenever a finite sequence of [[pairwise disjoint]] sub-intervals [''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;] of ''I'' satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k} \left| y_k - x_k \right| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k} d \left( f(y_k), f(x_k) \right) &lt; \epsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

The collection of all absolutely continuous functions from ''I'' into ''X'' is denoted AC(''I''; ''X'').

A further generalization is the space AC&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''I''; ''X'') of curves ''f'': ''I'' ‚Üí ''X'' such that&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ambrosio|Gigli|Savar√©|2005|loc=Definition 1.1.1 on page 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;d \left( f(s), f(t) \right) \leq \int_s^t m(\tau) \,d\tau \text{ for all } [s, t] \subseteq I&lt;/math&gt;

for some ''m'' in the [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; space]] ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(I).

===Properties of these generalizations===
* Every absolutely continuous function is [[uniform continuity|uniformly continuous]] and, therefore, [[Continuous function|continuous]]. Every [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz-continuous]] [[function (mathematics)|function]] is absolutely continuous.
* If ''f'': [''a'',''b''] ‚Üí ''X'' is absolutely continuous, then it is of [[bounded variation]] on [''a'',''b''].
* For ''f'' ‚àà AC&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''I''; ''X''), the [[metric derivative]] of ''f'' exists for ''Œª''-[[almost all]] times in ''I'', and the metric derivative is the smallest ''m'' ‚àà ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''I''; '''R''') such that&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ambrosio|Gigli|Savar√©|2005|loc=Theorem 1.1.2 on page 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;d \left( f(s), f(t) \right) \leq \int_s^t m(\tau) \,d\tau \text{ for all } [s, t] \subseteq I.&lt;/math&gt;

==Absolute continuity of measures==

===Definition===
A [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; on [[Borel set|Borel subsets]] of the real line is absolutely continuous with respect to [[Lebesgue measure]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; (in other words, dominated by &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) if for every measurable set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\lambda(A) = 0&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\mu(A)=0&lt;/math&gt; . This is written as &lt;math&gt;\mu \ll \lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

In most applications, if a measure on the real line is simply said to be absolutely continuous &amp;mdash; without specifying with respect to which other measure it is absolutely continuous &amp;mdash; then absolute continuity with respect to Lebesgue measure is meant.

The same works for measures on Borel subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n, n\ge 2&lt;/math&gt;.

===Equivalent definitions===
The following conditions on a finite measure ''Œº'' on Borel subsets of the real line are equivalent:&lt;ref&gt;Equivalence between (1) and (2) is a special case of {{harvnb|Nielsen|1997|loc=Proposition 15.5 on page 251}} (fails for œÉ-finite measures); equivalence between (1) and (3) is a special case of the [[Radon‚ÄìNikodym theorem]], see {{harvnb|Nielsen|1997|loc=Theorem 15.4 on page 251}} or {{harvnb|Athreya|Lahiri|2006|loc=Item (ii) of Theorem 4.1.1 on page 115}} (still holds for œÉ-finite measures).&lt;/ref&gt;

:(1) ''Œº'' is absolutely continuous;

:(2) for every positive number ''Œµ'' there is a positive number ''Œ¥'' such that {{nowrap|''Œº''(''A'') &lt; ''Œµ''}} for all Borel sets ''A'' of Lebesgue measure less than ''Œ¥'';

:(3) there exists a Lebesgue integrable function ''g'' on the real line such that
:: &lt;math&gt; \mu(A) = \int_A g \,d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
:for all Borel subsets ''A'' of the real line.

For an equivalent definition in terms of functions see the section [[#Relation between the two notions of absolute continuity|Relation between the two notions of absolute continuity]].

Any other function satisfying (3) is equal to ''g'' almost everywhere. Such a function is called [[Radon‚ÄìNikodym derivative]], or density, of the absolutely continuous measure ''Œº''.

Equivalence between (1), (2) and (3) holds also in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;...

Thus, the absolutely continuous measures on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; are precisely those that have densities; as a special case, the absolutely continuous probability measures are precisely the ones that have [[probability density function]]s.

===Generalizations===
If ''Œº'' and ''ŒΩ'' are two [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]s on the same [[measurable space]] then ''Œº'' is said to be '''absolutely continuous with respect to ''ŒΩ''''', or '''dominated by ''ŒΩ''''' if ''Œº''(''A'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for every set ''A'' for which ''ŒΩ''(''A'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nielsen|1997|loc=Definition 15.3 on page 250}}; {{harvnb|Royden|1988|loc=Sect. 11.6, page 276}}; {{harvnb|Athreya|Lahiri|2006|loc=Definition 4.1.1 on page 113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is written as "''Œº''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\ll&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;''ŒΩ''". In symbols:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu \ll \nu \iff \forall A \left( \nu(A) = 0\ \Rightarrow\ \mu (A) = 0 \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Absolute continuity of measures is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[transitive relation|transitive]], but is not [[Antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], so it is a [[preorder]] rather than a [[partial order]]. Instead, if ''Œº''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\ll&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;''ŒΩ'' and ''ŒΩ''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\ll&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;''Œº'', the measures ''Œº'' and ''ŒΩ'' are said to be [[Equivalence (measure theory)|equivalent]].  Thus absolute continuity induces a partial ordering of such [[equivalence class]]es.

If ''Œº'' is a [[signed measure|signed]] or [[complex measure]], it is said that ''Œº'' is absolutely continuous with respect to ''ŒΩ'' if its variation |''Œº''| satisfies |''Œº''|&amp;nbsp;‚â™&amp;nbsp;ŒΩ; equivalently, if every set ''A'' for which ''ŒΩ''(''A'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is ''Œº''-[[null set|null]].

The [[Radon‚ÄìNikodym theorem]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Royden|1988|loc=Theorem 11.23 on page 276}}; {{harvnb|Nielsen|1997|loc=Theorem 15.4 on page 251}}; {{harvnb|Athreya|Lahiri|2006|loc=Item (ii) of Theorem 4.1.1 on page 115}}.&lt;/ref&gt; states that if ''Œº'' is absolutely continuous with respect to ''ŒΩ'', and both measures are [[œÉ-finite]], then ''Œº'' has a density, or "Radon-Nikodym derivative", with respect to ''ŒΩ'', which means that there exists a ''ŒΩ''-measurable function ''f'' taking values in [0,&amp;nbsp;+‚àû), denoted by ''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''dŒº''/''dŒΩ'', such that for any ''ŒΩ''-measurable set ''A'' we have

:&lt;math&gt;\mu(A) = \int_A f \,d\nu.&lt;/math&gt;

===Singular measures===
Via [[Lebesgue's decomposition theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Royden|1988|loc=Proposition 11.24 on page 278}}; {{harvnb|Nielsen|1997|loc=Theorem 15.14 on page 262}}; {{harvnb|Athreya|Lahiri|2006|loc=Item (i) of Theorem 4.1.1 on page 115}}.&lt;/ref&gt; every measure can be decomposed into the sum of an absolutely continuous measure and a singular measure. See [[singular measure]] for examples of measures that are not absolutely continuous.

==Relation between the two notions of absolute continuity==
A finite measure ''Œº'' on [[Borel set|Borel subsets]] of the real line is absolutely continuous with respect to [[Lebesgue measure]] if and only if the point function
:&lt;math&gt;F(x)=\mu((-\infty,x])&lt;/math&gt;
is an absolutely continuous real function.
More generally, a function is locally (meaning on every bounded interval) absolutely continuous if and only if its [[distributional derivative]] is a measure that is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure.

If absolute continuity holds then the Radon‚ÄìNikodym derivative of ''Œº'' is equal almost everywhere to the derivative of ''F''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Royden|1988|loc=Problem 12.17(b) on page 303}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, the measure ''Œº'' is assumed to be locally finite (rather than finite) and ''F''(''x'') is defined as ''Œº''((0,''x'']) for {{nowrap|''x'' &gt; 0}}, 0 for {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 0}}, and ‚àí''Œº''((''x'',0]) for {{nowrap|''x'' &lt; 0}}. In this case ''Œº'' is the [[Lebesgue‚ÄìStieltjes integration|Lebesgue‚ÄìStieltjes measure]] generated by ''F''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Athreya|Lahiri|2006|loc=Sect. 1.3.2, page 26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The relation between the two notions of absolute continuity still holds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nielsen|1997|loc=Proposition 15.7 on page 252}}; {{harvnb|Athreya|Lahiri|2006|loc=Theorem 4.4.3 on page 131}}; {{harvnb|Royden|1988|loc=Problem 12.17(a) on page 303}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rubik's cube v2.svg|thumb | alt=Picture of a Rubik's Cube | The [[permutation]]s of [[Rubik's Cube]] form a [[Group theory|group]], a fundamental concept within abstract algebra.]]
In [[algebra]], which is a broad division of [[mathematics]], '''abstract algebra''' (occasionally called '''modern algebra''') is the study of [[algebraic structure]]s. Algebraic structures include [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[module (mathematics)|modules]], [[vector space]]s, [[lattice (order)|lattices]], and [[algebra over a field|algebras]]. The term ''abstract algebra'' was coined in the early 20th century to distinguish this area of study from the other parts of algebra.

Algebraic structures, with their associated [[homomorphism]]s, form [[category (mathematics)|mathematical categories]]. [[Category theory]] is a formalism that allows a unified  way for expressing properties and constructions that are similar for various structures.

[[Universal algebra]] is a related subject that studies types of algebraic structures as single objects. For example, the structure of groups is a single object in universal algebra, which is called ''variety of groups''.

==History==
As in other parts of mathematics, concrete problems and examples have played important roles in the development of abstract algebra. Through the end of the nineteenth century, many{{snd}}perhaps most{{snd}}of these problems were in some way related to the theory of algebraic equations. Major themes include:
* Solving of systems of linear equations, which led to [[linear algebra]]
* Attempts to find formulas for solutions of general [[polynomial]] equations of higher degree that resulted in discovery of [[Galois group|groups]] as abstract manifestations of [[symmetry]]
* Arithmetical investigations of quadratic and higher degree forms and [[diophantine equation]]s, that directly produced the notions of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] and [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]].

Numerous textbooks in abstract algebra start with axiomatic definitions of various [[algebraic structure]]s and then proceed to establish their properties. This creates a false impression that in algebra axioms had come first and then served as a motivation and as a basis of further study. The true order of historical development was almost exactly the opposite. For example, the [[hypercomplex number]]s of the nineteenth century had kinematic and physical motivations but challenged comprehension. Most theories that are now recognized as parts of algebra started as collections of disparate facts from various branches of mathematics, acquired a common theme that served as a core around which various results were grouped, and finally became unified on a basis of a common set of concepts. An archetypical example of this progressive synthesis can be seen in the [[history of group theory]].

===Early group theory===
There were several threads in the early development of group theory, in modern language loosely corresponding to ''number theory'', ''theory of equations'', and ''geometry''.

[[Leonhard Euler]] considered [[algebraic operation]]s on numbers modulo an integer, [[modular arithmetic]], in [[Euler's theorem|his generalization]] of [[Fermat's little theorem]]. These investigations were taken much further by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], who considered the structure of multiplicative groups of residues mod n and established many properties of [[cyclic group|cyclic]] and more general [[abelian group|abelian]] groups that arise in this way. In his investigations of [[composition of binary quadratic forms]], Gauss explicitly stated the [[associative property|associative law]] for the composition of forms, but like Euler before him, he seems to have been more interested in concrete results than in general theory. In 1870, [[Leopold Kronecker]] gave a definition of an abelian group in the context of [[ideal class group]]s of a number field, generalizing Gauss's work; but it appears he did not tie his definition with previous work on groups, particularly permutation groups. In 1882, considering the same question, [[Heinrich M. Weber]] realized the connection and gave a similar definition that involved the [[cancellation property]] but omitted the existence of the [[inverse element]], which was sufficient in his context (finite groups).

[[Permutation]]s were studied by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] in his 1770 paper ''R√©flexions sur la r√©solution alg√©brique des √©quations (Thoughts on the algebraic solution of equations)'' devoted to solutions of algebraic equations, in which he introduced [[Lagrange resolvents]]. Lagrange's goal was to understand why equations of third and fourth degree admit formulas for solutions, and he identified as key objects permutations of the roots. An important novel step taken by Lagrange in this paper was the abstract view of the roots, i.e. as symbols and not as numbers. However, he did not consider composition of permutations. Serendipitously, the first edition of [[Edward Waring]]'s ''Meditationes Algebraicae'' (''Meditations on Algebra'') appeared in the same year, with an expanded version published in 1782. Waring proved the [[fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials]], and specially considered the relation between the roots of a quartic equation and its resolvent cubic. ''M√©moire sur la r√©solution des √©quations'' (''Memoire on the Solving of Equations'') of [[Alexandre Vandermonde]] (1771) developed the theory of symmetric functions from a slightly different angle, but like Lagrange, with the goal of understanding solvability of algebraic equations.

{{quote|Kronecker claimed in 1888 that the study of modern algebra began with this first paper of Vandermonde. Cauchy states quite clearly that Vandermonde had priority over Lagrange for this remarkable idea, which eventually led to the study of group theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Vandermonde|title=Alexandre-Th√©ophile Vandermonde}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Paolo Ruffini]] was the first person to develop the theory of [[permutation group]]s, and like his predecessors, also in the context of solving algebraic equations. His goal was to establish the impossibility of an algebraic solution to a general algebraic equation of degree greater than four. En route to this goal he introduced the notion of the order of an element of a group, conjugacy, the cycle decomposition of elements of permutation groups and the notions of primitive and imprimitive and proved some important theorems relating these concepts, such as
{{quote|if G is a subgroup of S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; whose order is divisible by 5 then G contains an element of order 5.}}
Note, however, that he got by without formalizing the concept of a group, or even of a permutation group.
The next step was taken by [[√âvariste Galois]] in 1832, although his work remained unpublished until 1846, when he considered for the first time what is now called the ''closure property'' of a group of permutations, which he expressed as
{{quote|if in such a group one has the substitutions S and T then one has the substitution ST.}}

The theory of permutation groups received further far-reaching development in the hands of [[Augustin Cauchy]] and [[Camille Jordan]], both through introduction of new concepts and, primarily, a great wealth of results about special classes of permutation groups and even some general theorems. Among other things, Jordan defined a notion of [[isomorphism]], still in the context of permutation groups and, incidentally, it was he who put the term ''group'' in wide use.

The abstract notion of a group appeared for the first time in [[Arthur Cayley]]'s papers in 1854. Cayley realized that a group need not be a permutation group (or even ''finite''), and may instead consist of [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], whose algebraic properties, such as multiplication and inverses, he systematically investigated in succeeding years. Much later Cayley would revisit the question whether abstract groups were more general than permutation groups, and establish that, in fact, any group is isomorphic to a group of permutations.

===Modern algebra===
The end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century saw a tremendous shift in the methodology of mathematics. Abstract algebra emerged around the start of the 20th century, under the name ''modern algebra''. Its study was part of the drive for  more [[intellectual rigor]] in mathematics. Initially, the assumptions in classical [[algebra]], on which the whole of mathematics (and major parts of the [[natural sciences]]) depend, took the form of [[axiomatic system]]s. No longer satisfied with establishing properties of concrete objects, mathematicians started to turn their attention to general theory. Formal definitions of certain [[algebraic structure]]s began to emerge in the 19th century. For example, results about various groups of permutations came to be seen as instances of general theorems that concern a general notion of an ''abstract group''. Questions of structure and classification of various mathematical objects came to forefront.

These processes were occurring throughout all of mathematics, but became especially pronounced in algebra. Formal definition through primitive operations and axioms were proposed for many basic algebraic structures, such as [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], and [[field (mathematics)|fields]]. Hence such things as [[group theory]] and [[ring theory]] took their places in [[pure mathematics]]. The algebraic investigations of general fields by [[Ernst Steinitz]] and of commutative and then general rings by [[David Hilbert]], [[Emil Artin]] and [[Emmy Noether]], building up on the work of [[Ernst Kummer]], [[Leopold Kronecker]] and [[Richard Dedekind]], who had considered ideals in commutative rings, and of [[Georg Frobenius]] and [[Issai Schur]], concerning [[representation theory]] of groups, came to define abstract algebra. These developments of the last quarter of the 19th century and the first quarter of 20th century were systematically exposed in [[Bartel van der Waerden]]'s ''Moderne algebra'', the two-volume [[monograph]] published in 1930‚Äì1931 that forever changed for the mathematical world the meaning of the word ''algebra'' from ''the theory of equations'' to the ''theory of algebraic structures''.

==Basic concepts==
{{Main|Algebraic structure}}

By abstracting away various amounts of detail, mathematicians have defined various algebraic structures that are used in many areas of mathematics. For instance, almost all systems studied are [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], to which the theorems of [[set theory]] apply. Those sets that have a certain binary operation defined on them form [[Magma (algebra)|magmas]], to which the concepts concerning magmas, as well those concerning sets, apply. We can add additional constraints on the  algebraic structure, such as associativity (to form [[semigroup]]s); identity, and inverses (to form [[Group (mathematics)|groups]]); and other more complex structures. With additional structure, more theorems could be proved, but the generality is reduced. The "hierarchy" of algebraic objects (in terms of generality) creates a hierarchy of the corresponding theories: for instance, the theorems of [[group theory]] may be used when studying [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]] (algebraic objects that have two binary operations with certain axioms) since a ring is a group over one of its operations. In general there is a balance between the amount of generality and the richness of the theory: more general structures have usually fewer [[nontrivial]] theorems and fewer applications.

Examples of algebraic structures with a single [[binary operation]] are:
* [[Magma (algebra)|Magma]]
* [[Quasigroup]]
* [[Monoid]]
* [[Semigroup]]
* [[Group (mathematics)|Group]]

Examples involving several operations include:
{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
* [[Ring (mathematics)|Ring]]
* [[Field (mathematics)|Field]]
* [[Module (mathematics)|Module]]
* [[Vector space]]
* [[Algebra over a field]]
* [[Associative algebra]]
* [[Lie algebra]]
* [[Lattice (order)|Lattice]]
* [[Boolean algebra]]
{{div col end}}

==Applications==

Because of its generality, abstract algebra is used in many fields of mathematics and science. For instance, [[algebraic topology]] uses algebraic objects to study topologies. The [[Poincar√© conjecture]], proved in 2003, asserts that the [[fundamental group]] of a manifold, which encodes information about connectedness, can be used to determine whether a manifold is a sphere or not. [[Algebraic number theory]] studies various number [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]] that generalize the set of integers. Using tools of algebraic number theory, [[Andrew Wiles]] proved [[Fermat's Last Theorem]].

In physics, groups are used to represent symmetry operations, and the usage of group theory could simplify differential equations. In [[gauge theory]], the requirement of [[local symmetry]] can be used to deduce the equations describing a system. The groups that describe those symmetries are [[Lie group]]s, and the study of Lie groups and Lie algebras reveals much about the physical system; for instance, the number of [[force carrier]]s in a theory is equal to the dimension of the Lie algebra, and these [[boson]]s interact with the force they mediate if the Lie algebra is nonabelian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Schumm|first=Bruce|title=Deep Down Things|year=2004|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0-8018-7971-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Ars Magna''''' ("The Great Art") is an important [[Latin]]-language book on [[algebra]] written by [[Girolamo Cardano]]. It was first published in 1545 under the title ''Artis Magn√¶, Sive de Regulis Algebraicis Liber Unus'' (''Book number one about The Great Art, or The Rules of Algebra''). There was a second edition in Cardano's lifetime, published in 1570. It is considered&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, the foreword that [[Oystein Ore]] wrote for the English translation of the book, mentioned at the bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the three greatest scientific treatises of the early [[Renaissance]], together with [[Copernicus]]' ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' and [[Vesalius]]' ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]''. The first editions of these three books were published within a two-year span (1543‚Äì1545).

==History==
In 1535 [[Niccol√≤ Fontana Tartaglia]] became famous for having solved cubics of the form ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ax''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b'' (with ''a'',''b''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0). However, he chose to keep his method secret. In 1539, Cardano, then a lecturer in mathematics at the Piatti Foundation in Milan, published his first mathematical book, ''Pratica Arithmetic√¶ et mensurandi singularis'' (''The Practice of Arithmetic and Simple Mensuration''). That same year, he asked Tartaglia to explain to him his method for solving [[cubic equations]]. After some reluctance, Tartaglia did so, but he asked Cardano not to share the information until he published it. Cardano submerged himself in mathematics during the next several years working on how to extend Tartaglia's formula to other types of cubics. Furthermore, his student [[Lodovico Ferrari]] found a way of solving quartic equations, but Ferrari's method depended upon Tartaglia's, since it involved the use of an auxiliary cubic equation. Then Cardano became aware of the fact that [[Scipione del Ferro]] had discovered Tartaglia's formula before Tartaglia himself, a discovery that prompted him to publish these results.

==Contents==
The book, which is divided into forty chapters, contains the first published algebraic solution to [[cubic equation|cubic]] and [[quartic equation]]s. Cardano acknowledges that Tartaglia gave him the formula for solving a type of cubic equations and that the same formula had been discovered by Scipione del Ferro. He also acknowledges that it was Ferrari who found a way of solving quartic equations.

Since at the time negative numbers were not generally acknowledged, knowing how to solve cubics of the form ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ax''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b'' did not mean knowing how to solve cubics of the form ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ax''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'' (with ''a'',''b''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0), for instance. Besides, Cardano, also explains how to reduce equations of the form ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''bx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 to cubic equations without a quadratic term, but, again, he has to consider several cases. In all, Cardano was driven to the study of thirteen different types of cubic equations (chapters XI‚ÄìXXIII).

In ''Ars Magna'' the concept of [[Multiplicity (mathematics)#Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial|multiple root]] appears for the first time (chapter I). The first example that Cardano provides of a polynomial equation with multiple roots is ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;12''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;16, of which &amp;minus;2 is a double root.

''Ars Magna'' also contains the first occurrence of [[complex number]]s (chapter&amp;nbsp;XXXVII). The problem mentioned by Cardano which leads to square roots of negative numbers is: find two numbers whose sum is equal to 10 and whose product is equal to 40. The answer is 5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;&amp;radic;&lt;span style="text-decoration: overline"&gt;&amp;minus;15&lt;/span&gt; and 5&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;&amp;radic;&lt;span style="text-decoration: overline"&gt;&amp;minus;15&lt;/span&gt;. Cardano called this "sophistic," because he saw no physical meaning to it, but boldly wrote "nevertheless we will operate" and formally calculated that their product does indeed equal 40. Cardano then says that this answer is &amp;ldquo;as subtle as it is useless&amp;rdquo;.

It is a common misconception that Cardano introduced complex numbers in solving cubic equations. Since (in modern notation) Cardano's formula for a root of the polynomial ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''px''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp; is
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{-\frac q2+\sqrt{\frac{q^2}{4}+\frac{p^3}{27}}}+\sqrt[3]{-\frac q2-\sqrt{\frac{q^2}{4}+\frac{p^3}{27}}},&lt;/math&gt;
square roots of negative numbers appear naturally in this context. However, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/27 never happens to be negative in the specific cases in which Cardano applies the formula.&lt;ref&gt;This does not mean that no cubic equation occurs in ''Ars Magna'' for which ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/27&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;0. For instance, chapter&amp;nbsp;I contains the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;9&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;12''x'', for which ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/27&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;175/4. However, Cardano never applies his formula in those cases.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2348">'''Blau space''' consists of the multidimensional [[coordinate system]], created by considering the set of [[demographics|socio-demographic]] variables as dimensions.  All socio-demographic characteristics are potential elements of Blau space, including continuous characteristics such as age, years of education, income, occupational prestige, geographic location, and so forth. In addition, categorical measures of socio-demographic characteristics such as race, sex, religion, birthplace, and others are Blau dimensions. "Blau space" is a [[theory|theoretical]] construct which was developed by Miller McPherson and named after [[Peter Blau]].  It was later elaborated by McPherson and Ranger-Moore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McPherson, Miller|title=Ecology of Affiliation|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=48|year=1983|pages=519‚Äì532|doi=10.2307/2117719}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McPherson|first1=Miller|first2=James|last2=Ranger-Moore|title=Evolution on a Dancing Landscape: Organizations and Networks in Dynamic Blau Space|journal=Social Forces|volume=70|year=1991|pages=19‚Äì42|jstor=10.2307/2580060|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/1991/mcpherson1991a.pdf|doi=10.1093/sf/70.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organizing force in Blau space is the [[homophily]] principle, which argues that the [[information flow|flow of information]] from person to person is a declining function of [[distance function|distance]] in Blau space.  Persons located at great distance in Blau space are very unlikely to interact, which creates the conditions for social differences in any characteristic that is transmitted through social [[communication]].  The homophily principle thus localizes communication in Blau space, leading to the development of social [[ecological niche|niche]]s for human activity and [[social organization]].

Although the idea of Blau Space was originally developed to consider individuals, it was extended to the context of cities (and other urban units) in Neal's "Building a Blau√ºrban Space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Zachary P. Neal|title=Building a Blau√ºrban space|conference=Midwest Sociological Society|date=March 30 ‚Äì April 2, 2006|location=Omaha, NE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method was introduced in the 1972 paper "The Actuary and IBNR," co-authored by Ron Bornhuetter and Ron Ferguson.&lt;ref name=variance /&gt;&lt;ref name=fried /&gt;&lt;ref name=bfpaper&gt;https://www.casact.org/pubs/proceed/proceed72/72181.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=investopedia&gt;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bornhuetterferguson-technique.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other loss reserving techniques, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method aims to estimate [[incurred but not reported]] insurance claim amounts. It is primarily used in the [[general insurance|property and casualty]]&lt;ref name=fried /&gt;&lt;ref name=wm /&gt; and [[health insurance]]&lt;ref name=soa /&gt; fields.

Generally considered a blend of the [[chain-ladder method|chain-ladder]] and expected claims loss reserving methods,&lt;ref name=soa /&gt;&lt;ref name=investopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=variance2 /&gt; the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method uses both reported or paid losses as well as an [[a priori probability|''a priori'']] expected loss ratio to arrive at an ultimate loss estimate.&lt;ref name=soa /&gt;&lt;ref name=wm&gt;https://www.casact.org/library/studynotes/Werner_Modlin_Ratemaking.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Simply, reported (or paid) losses are added to ''a priori'' expected losses multiplied by an estimated percent unreported. The estimated percent unreported (or unpaid) is established by observing historical claims experience.&lt;ref name=soa /&gt;

The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method can be used with either reported or paid losses.&lt;ref name=soa /&gt;&lt;ref name=fried /&gt;

==Methodology==

There are two algebraically equivalent approaches to calculating the Bornhuetter-Ferguson ultimate loss.

In the first approach, undeveloped reported (or paid) losses are added directly to expected losses (based on an ''a priori'' loss ratio) multiplied by an estimated percent unreported.

&lt;math&gt;BF = L + ELR * Exposure * (1 - w)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=soa /&gt;&lt;ref name=fried /&gt;&lt;ref name=variance2&gt;http://www.variancejournal.org/issues/01-02/292.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second approach, reported (or paid) losses are first developed to ultimate using a chain-ladder approach and applying a [[loss development factor]] (LDF). Next, the chain-ladder ultimate is multiplied by an estimated percent reported. Finally, expected losses multiplied by an estimated percent unreported are added (as in the first approach).

&lt;math&gt;BF = L * LDF * w + ELR * Exposure * (1 - w)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=soa /&gt;&lt;ref name=fried /&gt;

The estimated percent reported is the reciprocal of the loss development factor.&lt;ref name=soa /&gt;&lt;ref name=fried /&gt;

[[Incurred but not reported]] claims can then be determined by subtracting reported losses from the Bornhuetter-Ferguson ultimate loss estimate.

'''Campbell's theorem'''&lt;!--, named after [[????? Campbell]]--&gt;, also known as '''Campbell‚Äôs embedding theorem''' and the '''Campbell-Magaarrd theorem''', is a [[mathematical theorem]] that evaluates the [[asymptotic distribution]] of random impulses acting with a determined intensity on a [[Damping|damped system]].{{fact|date=November 2014}} The theorem guarantees that any n-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]] can be locally embedded in an (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional Ricci-flat Riemannian manifold.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, Carlos, Reza Tavakol, and Roustam Zalaltedinov. ''The Embedding of General Relativity in Five Dimensions''. N.p.: Springer Netherlands, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement==
Campbell's theorem states that any [[n-dimensional|''n''-dimensional]] [[Riemannian manifold]] can be [[embedding|embedded]] locally in an (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-manifold with a [[Ricci curvature]] of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;'''a''&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. The theorem also states, in similar form, that an ''n''-dimensional [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] can be both locally and isometrically embedded in an ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)/2-[[pseudo-Euclidean space]].

==Applications==
Campbell‚Äôs theorem can be used to produce the embedding of numerous [[Spacetime symmetries|4-dimensional spacetimes]] in [[five-dimensional space|5-dimensional]] [[Ricci-flat manifold|Ricci-flat spaces]]. It is also used to embed a class of [[n-dimensional space|''n''-dimensional Einstein spaces]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, James E., et al. "On Applications of Campbell's Embedding Theorem." On Applications of Campbell's Embedding Theorem 14 (1997): 1&amp;nbsp;17. Abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:H op h.PNG|thumb|right|250px|c.t.c. distance]]
'''Centre-to-centre distance''' (c.t.c. distance or ctc distance) is a concept for distances, also called on-center spacing (o.c. spacing or oc spacing), heart distance, and pitch.

It is the distance between the centre (the heart) of a [[column]] and the centre (the heart) of another column. By expressing a distance in c.t.c., one can measure distances between columns with different diameters without confusion. This concept applies to other architectural features that may have variable diameters/widths and spacings, such as pillars or ceiling beams &amp; baffles.

'''Common knowledge''' is a special kind of [[knowledge]] for a group of [[wiktionary:agent|agent]]s. There is ''common knowledge'' of ''p'' in a group of agents ''G'' when all the agents in ''G'' know ''p'', they all know that they know ''p'', they all know that they all know that they know ''p'', and so on ''ad infinitum''.&lt;ref name=Osborne&gt;Osborne, Martin J., and [[Ariel Rubinstein]]. ''A Course in Game Theory''. Cambridge, MA: MIT, 1994. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was first introduced in the philosophical literature by [[David Kellogg Lewis]] in his study ''Convention'' (1969).  The sociologist Morris Friedell defined common knowledge in a 1969 paper.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Friedell, "On the Structure of Shared Awareness," Behavioral Science 14 (1969): 28‚Äì39.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first given a mathematical formulation in a [[set theory|set-theoretical]] framework by [[Robert Aumann]] (1976). [[computer science|Computer scientists]] grew an interest in the subject of [[epistemic logic]] in general&amp;nbsp;‚Äì and of common knowledge in particular&amp;nbsp;‚Äì starting in the 1980s.{{ref|CSTexts}}  There are numerous [[Logic puzzle|puzzles]] based upon the concept which have been extensively investigated by mathematicians such as [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Math Hysteria| author=Ian Stewart |year=2004 |publisher=OUP |chapter=I Know That You Know That... |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Stephen Schiffer]], in his book ''Meaning'', independently developed a notion he called "mutual knowledge" which functions quite similarly to Lewis's "common knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Schiffer, ''Meaning'', 2nd edition, Oxford University Press, 1988.  The first edition was published by OUP in 1972.  For a discussion of both Lewis's and Schiffer's notions, see Russell Dale, ''[http://www.russelldale.com/dissertation/1996.RussellDale.TheTheoryOfMeaning.pdf The Theory of Meaning]'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==

=== Puzzle ===

The idea of common knowledge is often introduced by some variant of the following puzzle:{{ref|Sevitan}}

On an island, there are ''k'' people who have blue eyes, and the rest of the people have green eyes. At the start of the puzzle, no one on the island ever knows their own eye color. By rule, if a person on the island ever discovers they have blue eyes, that person must leave the island at dawn; anyone not making such a discovery always sleeps until after dawn. On the island, each person knows every other person's eye color, there are no reflective surfaces, and there is no communication of eye color.

At some point, an outsider comes to the island, calls together all the people on the island, and makes the following public announcement: "At least one of you has blue eyes". The outsider, furthermore, is known by all to be truthful, and all know that all know this, and so on: it is common knowledge that he is truthful, and thus it becomes common knowledge that there is at least one islander who has blue eyes. The problem: assuming all persons on the island are completely logical and that this too is common knowledge, what is the eventual outcome?

=== Solution ===

The answer is that, on the ''k''th dawn after the announcement, all the blue-eyed people will leave the island.

==== Proof ====
The solution can be seen with an inductive argument. If ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 (that is, there is exactly one blue-eyed person), the person will recognize that they alone have blue eyes (by seeing only green eyes in the others) and leave at the first dawn. If ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, no one will leave at the first dawn. The two blue-eyed people, seeing only one person with blue eyes, ''and'' that no one left on the 1st dawn (and thus that ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1), will leave on the second dawn. Inductively, it can be reasoned that no one will leave at the first ''k''&amp;nbsp;‚àí&amp;nbsp;1 dawns if and only if there are at least ''k'' blue-eyed people. Those with blue eyes, seeing ''k''&amp;nbsp;‚àí&amp;nbsp;1 blue-eyed people among the others and knowing there must be at least ''k'', will reason that they must have blue eyes and leave.

What's most interesting about this scenario is that, for ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, the outsider is only telling the island citizens what they already know: that there are blue-eyed people among them. However, before this fact is announced, the fact is not ''common knowledge''.

For ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, it is merely "first-order" knowledge. Each blue-eyed person knows that there is someone with blue eyes, but each blue eyed person does ''not'' know that the other blue-eyed person has this same knowledge.

For ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, it is "second order" knowledge. Each blue-eyed person knows that a second blue-eyed person knows that a third person has blue eyes, but no one knows that there is a ''third'' blue-eyed person with that knowledge, until the outsider makes his statement.

In general: For ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, it is "(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)th order" knowledge. Each blue-eyed person knows that a second blue-eyed person knows that a third blue-eyed person knows that.... (repeat for a total of ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 levels) a ''k''th person has blue eyes, but no one knows that there is a "''k''th" blue-eyed person with that knowledge, until the outsider makes his statement. The notion of ''common knowledge'' therefore has a palpable effect. Knowing that everyone knows does make a difference. When the outsider's public announcement (a fact already known to all) becomes common knowledge, the blue-eyed people on this island eventually deduce their status, and leave.

== Formalization ==

=== Modal logic (syntactic characterization) ===

Common knowledge can be given a logical definition in [[Modal logic|multi-modal logic]] systems in which the modal operators are interpreted [[epistemic logic|epistemically]]. At the propositional level, such systems are extensions of [[propositional logic]]. The extension consists of the introduction of a group ''G'' of ''agents'', and of ''n'' modal operators ''K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (with ''i'' = 1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n'') with the intended meaning that "agent ''i'' knows." Thus ''K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;'' (where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a formula of the calculus) is read "agent ''i'' knows &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;." We can define an operator ''E&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'' with the intended meaning of "everyone in group ''G'' knows" by defining it with the axiom

: &lt;math&gt;E_G \varphi \Leftrightarrow \bigwedge_{i \in G} K_i \varphi,&lt;/math&gt;

By abbreviating the expression &lt;math&gt;E_GE_G^{n-1} \varphi&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;E_G^n \varphi&lt;/math&gt;  and defining &lt;math&gt;E_G^0 \varphi = \varphi&lt;/math&gt;, we could then define common knowledge with the axiom

: &lt;math&gt;C \varphi \Leftrightarrow \bigwedge_{i = 0}^\infty E^i \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

There is however a complication. The languages of epistemic logic are usually ''finitary'', whereas the [[axiom]] above defines common knowledge as an infinite conjunction of formulas, hence not a [[well-formed formula]] of the language. To overcome this difficulty, a ''fixed-point'' definition of common knowledge can be given. Intuitively, common knowledge is thought of as the fixed point of the "equation" &lt;math&gt;C_G \varphi=\varphi\wedge E_G (C_G \varphi)&lt;/math&gt;. In this way, it is possible to find a formula &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; implying &lt;math&gt;E_G (\varphi \wedge C_G \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; from which, in the limit, we can infer common knowledge of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

This ''syntactic'' characterization is given semantic content through so-called ''Kripke structures''. A Kripke structure is given by (i) a set of states (or possible worlds) ''S'', (ii) ''n'' ''accessibility relations'' &lt;math&gt;R_1,\dots,R_n&lt;/math&gt;, defined on &lt;math&gt;S \times S&lt;/math&gt;, intuitively representing what states agent ''i'' considers possible from any given state, and (iii) a valuation function &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; assigning a [[truth value]], in each state, to each primitive proposition in the language. The semantics for the knowledge operator is given by stipulating that &lt;math&gt;K_i \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true at state ''s'' iff &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true at ''all'' states ''t'' such that &lt;math&gt;(s,t) \in R_i&lt;/math&gt;. The semantics for the common knowledge operator, then, is given by taking, for each group of agents ''G'', the reflexive and transitive closure of the &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;, for all agents ''i'' in ''G'', call such a relation &lt;math&gt;R_G&lt;/math&gt;, and stipulating that &lt;math&gt;C_G \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true at state ''s'' iff &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true at ''all'' states ''t'' such that &lt;math&gt;(s,t) \in R_G&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Set theoretic (semantic characterization) ===

Alternatively (yet equivalently) common knowledge can be formalized using [[set theory]] (this was the path taken by the Nobel laureate  [[Robert Aumann]] in his seminal 1976 paper).  We will start with a set of states ''S''.  We can then define an event ''E'' as a subset of the set of states ''S''.  For each agent ''i'', define a [[Partition of a set|partition]] on ''S'', ''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.  This partition represents the state of knowledge of an agent in a state.  In state ''s'', agent ''i'' knows that one of the states in ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') obtains, but not which one. (Here ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') denotes the unique element of ''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' containing ''s''. Note that this model excludes cases in which agents know things that are not true.)

We can now define a knowledge function ''K'' in the following way:

: &lt;math&gt;K_i(e) = \{ s \in S \mid P_i(s) \subset e\}&lt;/math&gt;

That is, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''e'') is the set of states where the agent will know that event ''e'' obtains. It is a subset of ''e''.

Similar to the modal logic formulation above, we can define an operator for the idea that "everyone knows ''e''".

: &lt;math&gt;E(e) = \bigcap_i K_i(e)&lt;/math&gt;

As with the modal operator, we will iterate the ''E'' function, &lt;math&gt;E^1(e) = E(e)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E^{n+1}(e) = E(E^{n}(e))&lt;/math&gt;.  Using this we can then define a common knowledge function,

: &lt;math&gt;C(e) = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} E^n(e).&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalence with the syntactic approach sketched above can easily be seen: consider an Aumann structure as the one just defined. We can define a correspondent Kripke structure by taking (i) the same space ''S'', (ii) accessibility relations &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; that define the equivalence classes corresponding to the partitions &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt;, and (iii) a valuation function such that it yields value ''true'' to the primitive proposition ''p'' in all and only the states ''s'' such that &lt;math&gt;s \in E^p&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E^p&lt;/math&gt; is the event of the Aumann structure corresponding to the primitive proposition ''p''. It is not difficult to see that the common knowledge accessibility function &lt;math&gt;R_G&lt;/math&gt; defined in the previous section corresponds to the finest common coarsening of the partitions &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i \in G&lt;/math&gt;, which is the finitary characterization of common knowledge also given by Aumann in the 1976 article.

== Applications ==

Common knowledge was used by David Lewis in his pioneering game-theoretical account of convention. In this sense, common knowledge is a concept still central for linguists and philosophers of language (see Clark 1996) maintaining a Lewisian, conventionalist account of language.

[[Robert Aumann]] introduced a set theoretical formulation of common knowledge (theoretically equivalent to the one given above) and proved the so-called [[Aumann's agreement theorem|agreement theorem]] through which: if two agents have common [[prior probability]] over a certain event, and the [[posterior probabilities]] are common knowledge, then such posterior probabilities are equal. A result based on the agreement theorem and proven by Milgrom shows that, given certain conditions on market efficiency and information, speculative trade is impossible.

The concept of common knowledge is central in [[game theory]]. For several years it has been thought that the assumption of common knowledge of rationality for the players in the game was fundamental. It turns out (Aumann and Brandenburger 1995) that, in 2-player games, common knowledge of rationality is not needed as an epistemic condition for [[Nash equilibrium]] [[strategy (game theory)|strategies]].

Computer scientists use languages incorporating epistemic logics (and common knowledge) to reason about distributed systems. Such systems can be based on logics more complicated than simple propositional epistemic logic, see Wooldridge ''Reasoning about Artificial Agents'', 2000 (in which he uses a first-order logic incorporating epistemic and temporal operators) or van der Hoek et al. "Alternating Time Epistemic Logic".

In his 2007 book,  ''[[The Stuff of Thought|The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window into Human Nature]],'' [[Steven Pinker]] uses the notion of common knowledge to analyze the kind of indirect speech involved in innuendoes.

In [[mathematical analysis]], a [[metric space]] ''M'' is called '''complete''' (or a '''Cauchy space''') if every [[Cauchy sequence#In a metric space|Cauchy sequence]] of points in ''M'' has a [[limit of a sequence|limit]] that is also in ''M'' or, alternatively, if every Cauchy sequence in ''M'' converges in ''M''.

Intuitively, a space is complete if there are no "points missing" from it (inside or at the boundary). For instance, the set of [[rational number]]s is not complete, because e.g. [[square root of 2|&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;]] is "missing" from it, even though one can construct a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers that converges to it. (See the examples below.)  It is always possible to "fill all the holes", leading to the ''completion'' of a given space, as explained below.

==Examples==
The space '''Q''' of [[rational number]]s, with the standard metric given by the [[absolute value]] of the [[subtraction|difference]], is not complete.  Consider for instance the sequence defined by &lt;math&gt;x_1 \;=\; 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} \;=\; \frac{x_n}{2} \,+\, \frac{1}{x_n}&lt;/math&gt;.  This is a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers, but it does not converge towards any rational limit: If the sequence did have a limit ''x'', then by solving &lt;math&gt;x \;=\; \frac{x}{2} \,+\, \frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;  necessarily ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2,  yet no rational number has this property. However, considered as a sequence of [[real number]]s, it does converge to the [[irrational number]] &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[interval (mathematics)|open interval]] {{open-open|0,1}}, again with the absolute value metric, is not complete either.  The sequence defined by ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = {{sfrac|1|''n''}} is Cauchy, but does not have a limit in the given space.  However the [[Closed set|closed]] interval [[unit interval|{{closed-closed|0,1}}]] is complete; for example the given sequence does have a limit in this interval and the limit is zero.

The space '''R''' of real numbers and the space '''C''' of [[complex number]]s (with the metric given by the absolute value) are complete, and so is [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, with the [[Euclidean distance|usual distance]] metric.  In contrast, infinite-dimensional [[normed vector space]]s may or may not be complete; those that are complete are [[Banach space]]s.  The space C{{closed-closed|''a'',‚Äâ''b''}} of [[continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space|continuous real-valued functions on a closed and bounded interval]] is a Banach space, and so a complete metric space, with respect to the [[supremum norm]].  However, the supremum norm does not give a norm on the space C{{open-open|''a'',‚Äâ''b''}} of continuous functions on {{open-open|''a'',‚Äâ''b''}}, for it may contain unbounded functions.  Instead, with the topology of [[compact convergence]], C{{open-open|''a'',‚Äâ''b''}} can be given the structure of a [[Fr√©chet space]]: a [[locally convex topological vector space]] whose topology can be induced by a complete translation-invariant metric.

The space '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]] is complete for any [[prime number]] ''p''.  This space completes '''Q''' with the ''p''-adic metric in the same way that '''R''' completes '''Q''' with the usual metric.

If ''S'' is an arbitrary set, then the set ''S''&lt;sup&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sup&gt; of all [[sequence]]s in ''S'' becomes a complete metric space if we define the distance between the sequences (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) to be {{sfrac|1|''N''}}, where ''N'' is the smallest index for which ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Distinct (mathematics)|distinct]] from ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;, or 0 if there is no such index.  This space is [[homeomorphic]] to the [[product topology|product]] of a [[countable]] number of copies of the [[discrete space]] ''S''.

==Some theorems==
A metric space ''X'' is complete if and only if every decreasing sequence of non-empty closed subsets of ''X'', with [[Diameter#Generalizations|diameters]] tending to&amp;nbsp;0, has a non-empty intersection: if ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is closed and non-empty, {{nowrap|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; ‚äÇ ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for every ''n'',  and {{nowrap|diam(''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ‚Üí 0}}, then there is a point {{nowrap|''x'' ‚àà ''X''}} common to all sets&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Every [[compact space|compact]] metric space is complete, though complete spaces need not be compact. In fact, a metric space is compact [[if and only if]] it is complete and [[totally bounded]]. This is a generalization of the [[Heine‚ÄìBorel theorem]], which states that any closed and bounded subspace ''S'' of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is compact and therefore complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Metric and Topological Spaces |first=Wilson A. |last=Sutherland |isbn=978-0-19-853161-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let {{nowrap|(''X'', ''d'')}} be a complete metric space. If {{nowrap|''A'' ‚äÜ ''X''}} is a closed set, then ''A'' is also complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/AClosedSubsetOfACompleteMetricSpaceIsComplete.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630104009/http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/AClosedSubsetOfACompleteMetricSpaceIsComplete.html |archivedate=2007-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Let {{nowrap|(''X'', ''d'')}} be a metric space. If {{nowrap|''A'' ‚äÜ ''X''}} is a complete set, then ''A'' is also closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/ACompleteSubspaceOfAMetricSpaceIsClosed.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630104041/http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/ACompleteSubspaceOfAMetricSpaceIsClosed.html |archivedate=2007-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''X'' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] and ''M'' is a complete metric space, then the set {{nowrap|B(''X'', ''M'')}} of all [[bounded function]]s ''f'' from ''X'' to ''M'' is a complete metric space. Here we define the distance in {{nowrap|B(''X'', ''M'')}} in terms of the distance in ''M'' with the [[supremum norm]]

:&lt;math&gt;d(f, g) \equiv \sup\left\{d[f(x), g(x)]: x \in X \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''X'' is a [[topological space]] and ''M'' is a complete metric space, then the set ''C''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''M'') consisting of all [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] bounded functions ''f'' from ''X'' to ''M'' is a closed subspace of {{nowrap|B(''X'', ''M'')}} and hence also complete.

The [[Baire category theorem]] says that every complete metric space is a [[Baire space]]. That is, the [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[countable|countably many]] [[nowhere dense]] subsets of the space has [[empty set|empty]] [[interior (topology)|interior]].

The [[Banach fixed point theorem]] states that a contraction mapping on a complete metric space admits a fixed point. The fixed point theorem is often used to prove the [[inverse function theorem]] on complete metric spaces such as Banach spaces.

The [[expansion constant]] of a metric space is the [[infimum]] of all constants &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mu&lt;/math&gt; such that whenever the family &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \left\{ \overline{B}(x_\alpha,\, r_\alpha) \right\}&lt;/math&gt; intersects pairwise, the intersection
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_\alpha \overline{B}(x_\alpha, \mu r_\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

is nonempty. A metric space is complete if and only if its expansion constant is ‚â§&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=B. |last=Gr√ºnbaum |title=Some applications of expansion constants |journal=[[Pacific Journal of Mathematics|Pacific J. Math.]] |volume=10 |number=1 |year=1960 |pages=193‚Äì201 |url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pjm/1103038634 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110251/http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pjm/1103038634 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Completion==
For any metric space ''M'', one can construct a complete metric space ''M‚Ä≤'' (which is also denoted as {{overline|M}}), which contains ''M'' as a [[dense subspace]].  It has the following [[universal property]]: if ''N'' is any complete metric space and ''f'' is any [[uniformly continuous function]] from ''M'' to ''N'', then there exists a [[unique (mathematics)|unique]] uniformly continuous function ''f‚Ä≤'' from ''M‚Ä≤'' to ''N'', which extends ''f''.  The space ''M''' is determined [[up to]] [[isometry]] by this property, and is called the ''completion'' of ''M''.

The completion of ''M'' can be constructed as a set of [[equivalence class]]es of Cauchy sequences in ''M''. For any two Cauchy sequences x=(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and y=(''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) in ''M'', we may define their distance as
: &lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = \lim_n d\left(x_n, y_n\right)&lt;/math&gt;

(This limit exists because the real numbers are complete.) This is only a [[pseudometric space|pseudometric]], not yet a metric, since two different Cauchy sequences may have the distance 0. But "having distance 0" is an [[equivalence relation]] on the set of all Cauchy sequences, and the set of equivalence classes is a metric space, the completion of ''M''.  The original space is embedded in this space via the identification of an element ''x'' of ''M''' with the equivalence class of sequences in ''M'' converging to ''x'' (i.e., the equivalence class containing the sequence with constant value ''x'').  This defines an [[isometry]] onto a dense subspace, as required. Notice, however, that this construction makes explicit use of the completeness of the real numbers, so completion of the rational numbers needs a slightly different treatment.

[[Georg Cantor|Cantor]]'s construction of the real numbers is similar to the above construction; the real numbers are the completion of the rational numbers using the ordinary absolute value to measure distances. The additional subtlety to contend with is that it is not logically permissible to use the completeness of the real numbers in their own construction. Nevertheless, equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences are defined as above, and the set of equivalence classes is easily shown to be a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] that has the rational numbers as a subfield. This field is complete, admits a natural [[total ordering]], and is the unique totally ordered complete field (up to isomorphism).  It is ''defined'' as the field of real numbers (see also [[Construction of the real numbers]] for more details). One way to visualize this identification with the real numbers as usually viewed is that the equivalence class consisting of those Cauchy sequences of rational numbers that "ought" to have a given real limit is identified with that real number. The truncations of the decimal expansion give just one choice of Cauchy sequence in the relevant equivalence class.

For a prime ''p'', the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]] arise by completing the rational numbers with respect to a different metric.

If the earlier completion procedure is applied to a [[normed vector space]], the result is a [[Banach space]] containing the original space as a dense subspace, and if it is applied to an [[inner product space]], the result is a [[Hilbert space]] containing the original space as a dense subspace.

==Topologically complete spaces==
Note that completeness is a property of the ''metric'' and not of the ''[[topology]]'', meaning that a complete metric space can be [[homeomorphic]] to a non-complete one.  An example is given by the real numbers, which are complete but homeomorphic to the open interval {{open-open|0,1}}, which is not complete.

In [[topology]] one considers ''[[completely metrizable space]]s'', spaces for which there exists at least one complete metric inducing the given topology.  Completely metrizable spaces can be characterized as those spaces that can be written as an [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of countably many open subsets of some complete metric space. Since the conclusion of the [[Baire category theorem]] is purely topological, it applies to these spaces as well.

Completely metrizable spaces are often called ''topologically complete''. However, the latter term is somewhat arbitrary since metric is not the most general structure on a topological space for which one can talk about completeness (see the section [[#Alternatives and generalizations|Alternatives and generalizations]]). Indeed, some authors use the term ''topologically complete'' for a wider class of topological spaces, the [[completely uniformizable space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, Problem 6.L, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

A topological space homeomorphic to a separable complete metric space is called a [[Polish space]].

==Alternatives and generalizations==
Since [[Cauchy sequence]]s can also be defined in general [[topological group]]s, an alternative to relying on a metric structure for defining completeness and constructing the completion of a space is to use a group structure.  This is most often seen in the context of [[topological vector space]]s, but requires only the existence of a continuous "subtraction" operation.  In this setting, the distance between two points ''x'' and ''y'' is gauged not by a real number ''Œµ'' via the metric ''d'' in the comparison ''d''(''x'', ''y'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''Œµ'', but by an open neighbourhood ''N'' of 0 via subtraction in the comparison ''x''&amp;nbsp;‚àí&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;‚àà&amp;nbsp;''N''.

A common generalisation of these definitions can be found in the context of a [[uniform space]], where an [[Uniform space#Entourage definition|entourage]] is a set of all pairs of points that are at no more than a particular "distance" from each other.

It is also possible to replace Cauchy ''sequences'' in the definition of completeness by Cauchy ''[[net (mathematics)|nets]]'' or [[filter (mathematics)#Filters in uniform spaces|Cauchy filters]].  If every Cauchy net (or equivalently every Cauchy filter) has a limit in ''X'', then ''X'' is called complete.  One can furthermore construct a completion for an arbitrary uniform space similar to the completion of metric spaces. The most general situation in which Cauchy nets apply is [[Cauchy space]]s; these too have a notion of completeness and completion just like uniform spaces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11592">In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[topology]], the operation of '''connected sum''' is a geometric modification on [[manifold]]s. Its effect is to join two given manifolds together near a chosen point on each. This construction plays a key role in the [[Surface (topology)#Classification of closed surfaces|classification of closed surfaces]].

More generally, one can also join manifolds together along identical submanifolds; this generalization is often called the '''fiber sum'''. There is also a closely related notion of a connected sum on [[knot (mathematics)|knot]]s, called the '''knot sum''' or '''composition''' of knots.

[[Image:Connected sum.svg|right|thumb|220px|Illustration of connected sum.]]

== Connected sum at a point ==

A '''connected sum''' of two ''m''-dimensional [[manifold]]s is a manifold formed by deleting a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]] inside each manifold and [[adjunction space|gluing together]] the resulting boundary [[sphere]]s.

If both manifolds are [[oriented]], there is a unique connected sum defined by having the gluing map reverse orientation. Although the construction uses the choice of the balls, the result is unique up to [[homeomorphism]]. One can also make this operation work in the [[smooth function|smooth]] [[category (mathematics)|category]], and then the result is unique up to [[diffeomorphism]]. There are subtle problems in the smooth case: not every diffeomorphism between the boundaries of the spheres gives the same composite manifold, even if the orientations are chosen correctly. For example, Milnor showed that two 7-cells can be glued along their boundary so that the result is an [[exotic sphere]] homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to a 7-sphere.

However, there is a canonical way to choose the gluing of &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; which gives a unique well defined connected sum.&lt;ref&gt;Kervaire and Milnor, Groups of Homotopy Spheres I, Annals of Mathematics Vol 77 No 3 May 1963&lt;/ref&gt; Choose embeddings &lt;math&gt;i_1 : D_n \rightarrow M_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i_2 : D_n \rightarrow M_2&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;i_1&lt;/math&gt; preserves orientation and &lt;math&gt;i_2&lt;/math&gt; reverses orientation. Now obtain &lt;math&gt;M_1 \# M_2&lt;/math&gt; from the disjoint sum

:&lt;math&gt; (M_1 - i_1(0)) \sqcup (M_2 - i_2(0))&lt;/math&gt;
by identifying &lt;math&gt;i_1(tu)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;i_2((1-t)u)&lt;/math&gt; for each unit vector &lt;math&gt;u \in S^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; and each &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; t &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. Choose the orientation for &lt;math&gt;M_1 \# M_2&lt;/math&gt; which is compatible with &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt;. The fact that this construction is well-defined depends crucially on the [[disc theorem]], which is not at all obvious. For further details, see &lt;ref&gt;Kosinski, Differential Manifolds, Academic Press Inc (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation of connected sum is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\#&lt;/math&gt;; for example &lt;math&gt;A \# B&lt;/math&gt; denotes the connected sum of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

The operation of connected sum has the sphere &lt;math&gt;S^m&lt;/math&gt; as an [[identity (mathematics)|identity]]; that is, &lt;math&gt;M \# S^m&lt;/math&gt; is homeomorphic (or diffeomorphic) to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

The classification of closed surfaces, a foundational and historically significant result in topology, states that any closed surface can be expressed as the connected sum of a sphere with some number &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; of [[torus|tori]] and some number &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of [[real projective plane]]s.

== Connected sum along a submanifold ==

Let &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; be two smooth, oriented manifolds of equal dimension and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; a smooth, closed, oriented manifold, embedded as a submanifold into both &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose furthermore that there exists an isomorphism of [[normal bundle]]s

:&lt;math&gt;\psi: N_{M_1} V \to N_{M_2} V&lt;/math&gt;

that reverses the orientation on each fiber. Then &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; induces an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism

:&lt;math&gt;N_1 \setminus V \cong N_{M_1} V \setminus V \to N_{M_2} V \setminus V \cong N_2 \setminus V,&lt;/math&gt;

where each normal bundle &lt;math&gt;N_{M_i} V&lt;/math&gt; is diffeomorphically identified with a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the map

:&lt;math&gt;N_{M_2} V \setminus V \to N_{M_2} V \setminus V&lt;/math&gt;

is the orientation-reversing diffeomorphic involution

:&lt;math&gt;v \mapsto v / |v|^2&lt;/math&gt;

on [[normal vector]]s. The '''connected sum''' of &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is then the space

:&lt;math&gt;(M_1 \setminus V) \bigcup_{N_1 \setminus V = N_2 \setminus V} (M_2 \setminus V)&lt;/math&gt;

obtained by gluing the deleted neighborhoods together by the orientation-preserving diffeomorphism. The sum is often denoted

:&lt;math&gt;(M_1, V) \# (M_2, V).&lt;/math&gt;

Its diffeomorphism type depends on the choice of the two embeddings of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and on the choice of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;.

Loosely speaking, each normal fiber of the submanifold &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; contains a single point of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, and the connected sum along &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is simply the connected sum as described in the preceding section, performed along each fiber. For this reason, the connected sum along &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is often called the '''fiber sum'''.

The special case of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; a point recovers the connected sum of the preceding section.

== Connected sum along a codimension-two submanifold ==

Another important special case occurs when the dimension of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is two less than that of the &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt;. Then the isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; of normal bundles exists whenever their [[Euler class]]es are opposite:

:&lt;math&gt;e(N_{M_1} V) = -e(N_{M_2} V).&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, in this case the [[structure group]] of the normal bundles is the [[circle group]] &lt;math&gt;SO(2)&lt;/math&gt;; it follows that the choice of embeddings can be canonically identified with the group of [[homotopy]] classes of maps from &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; to the circle, which in turn equals the first integral [[cohomology]] group &lt;math&gt;H^1(V)&lt;/math&gt;. So the diffeomorphism type of the sum depends on the choice of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; and a choice of element from &lt;math&gt;H^1(V)&lt;/math&gt;.

A connected sum along a codimension-two &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; can also be carried out in the category of [[symplectic manifold]]s; this elaboration is called the [[symplectic sum]].

== Local operation ==

The connected sum is a local operation on manifolds, meaning that it alters the summands only in a [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. This implies, for example, that the sum can be carried out on a single manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; containing two [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] copies of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, with the effect of gluing &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; to itself. For example, the connected sum of a two-sphere at two distinct points of the sphere produces the two-torus.

== Connected sum of knots ==

There is a closely related notion of the connected sum of two knots. In fact, if one regards a knot merely as a one-manifold, then the connected sum of two knots is just their connected sum as a one-dimensional manifold. However, the essential property of a knot is not its manifold structure (under which every knot is equivalent to a circle) but rather its [[embedding]] into the [[ambient space]]. So the connected sum of knots has a more elaborate definition that produces a well-defined embedding, as follows.

[[Image:Sum_of_knots.png|300px|center|thumb| Consider disjoint planar projections of each knot.]][[Image:Sum_of_knots2.png|thumb|center|300px|Find a rectangle in the plane where one pair of sides are arcs along each knot but is otherwise disjoint from the knots.]][[Image:Sum_of_knots3.svg|thumb|center|300px|Now join the two knots together by deleting these arcs from the knots and adding the arcs that form the other pair of sides of the rectangle.]]

This procedure results in the projection of a new knot, a '''connected sum''' (or '''knot sum''', or '''composition''') of the original knots.  For the connected sum of knots to be well defined, one has to consider '''oriented knots''' in 3-space.  To define the connected sum for two oriented knots:

# Consider a planar projection of each knot and suppose these projections are disjoint.
# Find a rectangle in the plane where one pair of sides are arcs along each knot but is otherwise disjoint from the knots '''and''' so that the arcs of the knots on the sides of the rectangle are oriented around the boundary of the rectangle in the '''same direction'''.
# Now join the two knots together by deleting these arcs from the knots and adding the arcs that form the other pair of sides of the rectangle.

The resulting connected sum knot inherits an orientation consistent with the orientations of the two original knots, and the oriented ambient isotopy class of the result is well-defined, depending only on the oriented ambient isotopy classes of the original two knots.

Under this operation, oriented knots in 3-space form a commutative [[monoid]] with unique [[prime factorization]], which allows us to define what is meant by a [[prime knot]].  Proof of commutativity can be seen by letting one summand shrink until it is very small and then pulling it along the other knot.  The unknot is the unit.  The two trefoil knots are the simplest [[prime knot]]s. Higher-dimensional knots can be added by splicing the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-spheres.

In three dimensions, the unknot cannot be written as the sum of two non-trivial knots. This fact follows from additivity of [[knot genus]]; another proof relies on an infinite construction sometimes called the [[Mazur swindle]].  In higher dimensions (with codimension at least three), it is possible to get an unknot by adding two nontrivial knots.

If one does '''not''' take into account the orientations of the knots, the connected sum operation is not well defined on isotopy classes of (nonoriented) knots.  To see this, consider two noninvertible knots ''K, L'' which are not equivalent (as unoriented knots); for example take the two pretzel knots ''K'' = ''P''(3,5,7) and ''L'' = ''P''(3,5,9).  Let ''K''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;‚àí&lt;/sub&gt; be ''K'' with its two inequivalent orientations, and let ''L''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;‚àí&lt;/sub&gt; be ''L'' with its two inequivalent orientations.  There are four oriented connected sums we may form:

* ''A'' = ''K''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; # ''L''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;
* ''B'' = ''K''&lt;sub&gt;‚àí&lt;/sub&gt; # ''L''&lt;sub&gt;‚àí&lt;/sub&gt;
* ''C'' = ''K''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; # ''L''&lt;sub&gt;‚àí&lt;/sub&gt;
* ''D'' = ''K''&lt;sub&gt;‚àí&lt;/sub&gt; # ''L''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;

The oriented ambient isotopy classes of these four oriented knots are all distinct.  And, when one considers ambient isotopy of the knots without regard to orientation, there are '''two distinct''' equivalence classes:  { ''A'' ~ ''B'' } and { ''C'' ~ ''D'' }.  To see that ''A'' and ''B'' are unoriented equivalent, simply note that they both may be constructed from the same pair of disjoint knot projections as above, the only difference being the orientations of the knots.  Similarly, one sees that ''C'' and ''D'' may be constructed from the same pair of disjoint knot projections.

[[Image:Decision Problem.svg|thumb|200px|A ''decision problem'' has only two possible outputs (''yes'' or ''no'') on any input.]]
In [[computability theory]] and [[computational complexity theory]], a '''decision problem''' is a problem that can be posed as a [[yes-no question]] of the input values. An example of a decision problem is deciding whether a given natural number is [[prime]]. Another is the problem "given two numbers ''x'' and ''y'', does ''x'' evenly divide ''y''?".  The answer is either 'yes' or 'no' depending upon the values of ''x'' and ''y''. A method for solving a decision problem, given in the form of an [[algorithm]], is called a '''decision procedure''' for that problem. A decision procedure for the decision problem "given two numbers ''x'' and ''y'', does ''x'' evenly divide ''y''?" would give the steps for determining whether ''x'' evenly divides ''y''. One such algorithm is [[long division]]. If the remainder is zero the answer is 'yes', otherwise it is 'no'. A decision problem which can be solved by an algorithm is called ''decidable''.

Decision problems typically appear in mathematical questions of [[decidability (logic)|decidability]], that is, the question of the existence of an [[effective method]] to determine the existence of some object or its membership in a set; some of the most important problems in mathematics are [[undecidable problem|undecidable]].

The field of computational complexity categorizes ''decidable'' decision problems by how difficult they are to solve. "Difficult", in this sense, is described in terms of the [[computational resource]]s needed by the most efficient algorithm for a certain problem. The field of [[recursion theory]], meanwhile, categorizes ''undecidable'' decision problems by [[Turing degree]], which is a measure of the noncomputability inherent in any solution.

==Definition==
A ''decision problem'' is a yes-or-no question on an [[infinite set]] of inputs. It is traditional to define the decision problem as the set of possible inputs together with the set of inputs for which the answer is ''yes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.stanford.edu/~trevisan/cs254-10/lecture02.pdf|title=CS254: Computational Complexity: Lecture 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These inputs can be natural numbers, but can also be values of some other kind, like binary [[string (computer science)|string]]s or strings over some other [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]. The subset of strings for which the problem returns "yes" is a [[formal language]], and often decision problems are defined as formal languages.

Using an encoding such as [[G√∂del numbering]]s, any string can be encoded as a natural number, via which a decision problem can be defined as a subset of the natural numbers.

==Examples==
A classic example of a decidable decision problem is the set of prime numbers. It is possible to effectively decide whether a given natural number is prime by testing every possible nontrivial factor. Although much more efficient methods of [[primality testing]] are known, the existence of any effective method is enough to establish decidability.

== Decidability ==

{{main|Undecidable problem|Decidability (logic)}}

A decision problem ''A'' is ''decidable'' or ''effectively solvable'' if ''A'' is a [[recursive set]].  A problem is ''partially decidable'', ''semidecidable'', ''solvable'', or ''provable'' if ''A'' is a [[recursively enumerable set]].  Problems that are not decidable are ''undecidable''. For those it is not possible to create an algorithm, efficient or otherwise, that solves them.

The [[halting problem]] is an important undecidable decision problem; for more examples, see [[list of undecidable problems]].

== Complete problems ==

{{main|Complete problem}}

Decision problems can be ordered according to [[many-one reduction|many-one reducibility]] and related to feasible reductions such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s. A decision problem ''P'' is said to be ''[[complete problem|complete]]'' for a set of decision problems ''S'' if ''P'' is a member of ''S'' and every problem in ''S'' can be reduced to ''P''. Complete decision problems are used in [[computational complexity theory]] to characterize [[complexity class]]es of decision problems. For example, the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]] is complete for the class [[NP (complexity)|NP]] of decision problems under polynomial-time reducibility.

==Function problems==
{{main|function problem}}

Decision problems are closely related to [[function problem]]s, which can have answers that are more complex than a simple 'yes' or 'no'.  A corresponding function problem is "given two numbers ''x'' and ''y'', what is ''x'' divided by ''y''?".

A [[function problem]] consists of a [[partial function]] ''f''; the informal "problem" is to compute the values of ''f'' on the inputs for which it is defined.

Every function problem can be turned into a decision problem; the decision problem is just the graph of the associated function.   (The graph of a function ''f'' is the set of pairs (''x'',''y'') such that ''f''(''x'') = ''y''.)  If this decision problem were effectively solvable then the function problem would be as well.  This reduction does not respect computational complexity, however.  For example, it is possible for the graph of a function to be decidable in polynomial time (in which case running time is computed as a function of the pair (''x'',''y'') ) when the function is not computable in [[polynomial time]] (in which case running time is computed as a function of ''x'' alone).  The function ''f''(''x'') = ''2''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; has this property.

Every decision problem can be converted into the function problem of computing the [[indicator function|characteristic function]] of the set associated to the decision problem.   If this function is computable then the associated decision problem is decidable. However, this reduction is more liberal than the standard reduction used in computational complexity (sometimes called polynomial-time many-one reduction); for example, the complexity of the characteristic functions of an [[NP-complete]] problem and its [[co-NP-complete]] [[Complement (complexity)|complement]] is exactly the same even though the underlying decision problems may not be considered equivalent in some typical models of computation.

==Optimization problems==
{{main|Optimization problem}}

Unlike decision problems, for which there is only one correct answer for each input, optimization problems are concerned with finding the ''best'' answer to a particular input.  Optimization problems arise naturally in many applications, such as the [[traveling salesman problem]] and many questions in [[linear programming]].

There are standard techniques for transforming function and optimization problems into decision problems. For example, in the traveling salesman problem, the optimization problem is to produce a tour with minimal weight. The associated decision problem is: for each ''N'', to decide whether the graph has any tour with weight less than ''N''.  By repeatedly answering the decision problem, it is possible to find the minimal weight of a tour.

Because the theory of decision problems is very well developed, research in complexity theory has typically focused on decision problems. Optimization problems themselves are still of interest in computability theory, as well as in fields such as [[operations research]].

'''Equiprobability''' is a property for a collection of events that each have the same [[probability]] of occurring. In [[statistics]] and [[probability theory]] it is applied in the [[discrete uniform distribution]] and the [[equidistribution theorem]] for rational numbers. If there are &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; events under consideration, the probability of each occurring is &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{1}{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[philosophy]] it corresponds to a concept that allows one to assign equal [[epistemic probability|probabilities]] to outcomes when they are judged to be [[equipossible]] or to be "equally likely" in some sense. The best-known formulation of the rule is [[Laplace]]'s [[principle of indifference]] (or ''principle of insufficient reason''), which states that, when "we have no other [[Information content|information]] than" that exactly &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; [[mutually exclusive]] events can occur, we are justified in assigning each the probability &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{1}{N}.&lt;/math&gt; This [[Subjective probability|subjective assignment of probabilities]] is especially justified for situations such as [[Dice|rolling dice]] and [[lottery|lotteries]] since these experiments carry a [[symmetry group|symmetry]] structure, and one's state of knowledge must clearly be [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under this symmetry.

A similar argument could lead to the seemingly absurd conclusion that the sun is as likely to rise as to not rise tomorrow morning. However, the conclusion that the sun is equally likely to rise as it is to not rise is only absurd when additional information is known, such as the laws of gravity and the sun's history. Similar applications of the concept are effectively instances of [[circular reasoning]], with "equally likely" events being assigned equal probabilities, which means in turn that they are equally likely. Despite this, the notion remains useful in probabilistic and [[statistics|statistical]] [[Scientific modelling|modeling]].

In [[Bayesian probability]], one needs to establish [[prior probabilities]] for the various hypotheses before applying [[Bayes' theorem]]. One procedure is to assume that these prior probabilities have some symmetry which is typical of the experiment, and then assign a prior which is proportional to the [[Haar measure]] for the symmetry group: this generalization of equiprobability is known as the [[principle of transformation groups]] and leads to misuse of equiprobability as a model for incertitude.

In [[mathematics]], a '''Fekete polynomial''' is a [[polynomial]]

:&lt;math&gt;f_p(t):=\sum_{a=0}^{p-1} \left (\frac{a}{p}\right )t^a\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\cdot}{p}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Legendre symbol]] modulo some integer&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.

These polynomials were known in nineteenth-century studies of [[Dirichlet L-function]]s, and indeed to [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] himself. They have acquired the name of [[Michael Fekete]], who observed that the absence of real zeroes ''t'' of the Fekete polynomial with 0 &lt; ''t'' &lt; 1 implies an absence of the same kind for the [[L-function]]

:&lt;math&gt; L\left(s,\dfrac{x}{p}\right).\, &lt;/math&gt;

This is of considerable potential interest in [[number theory]], in connection with the hypothetical [[Siegel zero]] near&amp;nbsp;''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. While numerical results for small cases had indicated that there were few such real zeroes, further analysis reveals that this may indeed be a 'small number' effect.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13374">In [[computer science]], '''graph transformation''', or '''graph rewriting''', concerns the technique of creating a new [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] out of an original graph algorithmically. It has numerous applications, ranging from [[software engineering]] ([[software construction]] and also [[Formal verification|software verification]]) to [[layout algorithm]]s and picture generation.

Graph transformations can be used as a computation abstraction. The basic idea is that the state of a computation can be represented as a graph, further steps in that computation can then be represented as transformation rules on that graph. Such rules consist of an original graph, which is to be matched to a subgraph in the complete state, and a replacing graph, which will replace the matched subgraph.

Formally, a graph [[rewriting]] system usually consists of a set of graph rewrite rules of the form &lt;math&gt;L \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; being called pattern graph (or left-hand side) and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; being called replacement graph (or right-hand side of the rule). A graph rewrite rule is applied to the host graph by searching for an occurrence of the pattern graph ([[pattern matching]], thus solving the [[subgraph isomorphism problem]]) and by replacing the found occurrence by an instance of the replacement graph. Rewrite rules can be further regulated in the case of [[labeled graph]]s, such as in string-regulated graph grammars.

Sometimes '''graph grammar''' is used as a synonym for '''graph rewriting system''', especially in the context of [[formal language]]s; the different wording is used to emphasize the goal of constructions, like the enumeration of all graphs from some starting graph, i.e. the generation of a graph language ‚Äì instead of simply transforming a given state (host graph) into a new state.

==Graph rewriting approaches==

===Algebraic approach===
The '''algebraic approach''' to graph rewriting is based upon [[category theory]]. The algebraic approach is further divided into sub-approaches, the most common of which are the '''[[Double pushout graph rewriting|double-pushout (DPO) approach]]''' and the '''[[Single pushout graph rewriting|single-pushout (SPO) approach]]'''. Other sub-approaches include the ''sesqui-pushout'' and the ''pullback'' approach''.

From the perspective of the DPO approach a graph rewriting rule is a pair of [[morphism]]s in the category of graphs and [[graph homomorphism]]s between them: &lt;math&gt;r = (L \leftarrow K \rightarrow R)&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;L \supseteq K \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt;) where &lt;math&gt;K \rightarrow L&lt;/math&gt; is [[injective]]. The graph K is called ''invariant'' or sometimes the ''gluing graph''. A '''[[rewriting]] step''' or ''application'' of a rule r to a ''host graph'' G is defined by two [[pushout (category theory)|pushout]] diagrams both originating in the same [[morphism]] &lt;math&gt;k\colon K\rightarrow D&lt;/math&gt;, where D is a ''context graph'' (this is where the name ''double''-pushout comes from). Another graph morphism &lt;math&gt;m\colon L\rightarrow G&lt;/math&gt; models an occurrence of L in G and is called a '''[[Pattern matching|match]]'''. Practical understanding of this is that &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is a subgraph that is matched from &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (see [[subgraph isomorphism problem]]), and after a match is found, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is replaced with &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; in host graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; serves as an interface, containing the nodes and edges which are preserved when applying the rule. The graph &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is needed to attach the pattern being matched to its context: if it is empty, the match can only designate a whole connected component of the graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

In contrast a graph rewriting rule of the SPO approach is a single morphism in the category of [[labeled multigraph]]s and ''partial mappings'' that preserve the multigraph structure: &lt;math&gt;r\colon L\rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt;. Thus a rewriting step is defined by a single [[Pushout (category theory)|pushout]] diagram. Practical understanding of this is similar to the DPO approach. The difference is, that there is no interface between the host graph G and the graph G' being the result of the rewriting step.

From the practical perspective, the key distinction between DPO and SPO is how they deal with the deletion of nodes with adjacent edges, in particular, how they avoid that such deletions may leave behind "dangling edges". The DPO approach only deletes a node when the rule specifies the deletion of all adjacent edges as well (this ''dangling condition'' can be checked for a given match), whereas the SPO approach simply disposes the adjacent edges, without requiring an explicit specification.

There is also another algebraic-like approach to graph rewriting, based mainly on Boolean algebra and an algebra of matrices, called '''matrix graph grammars'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perez|2009}} covers this approach in detail.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This topic is expanded at [http://www.mat2gra.info/ mat2gra.info].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Determinate graph rewriting===
Yet another approach to graph rewriting, known as ''determinate'' graph rewriting, came out of [[logic]] and [[database theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~vgucht/p24-gyssens.pdf |title=A Graph-Oriented Object Model for Database End-User Interfaces}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In this approach, graphs are treated as database instances, and rewriting operations as a mechanism for defining queries and views; therefore, all rewriting is required to yield unique results ([[up to isomorphism]]), and this is achieved by applying any rewriting rule concurrently throughout the graph, wherever it applies, in such a way that the result is indeed uniquely defined.

===Term graph rewriting===
Another approach to graph rewriting is [[term graph]] rewriting, which involves the processing or transformation of term graphs (also known as ''abstract semantic graphs'') by a set of syntactic rewrite rules.

Term graphs are a prominent topic in programming language research since term graph rewriting rules are capable of formally expressing a compiler's [[operational semantics]]. Term graphs are also used as abstract machines capable of modelling chemical and biological computations as well as graphical calculi such as concurrency models. Term graphs can perform [[automated verification]] and logical programming since they are well-suited to representing quantified statements in first order logic. Symbolic programming software is another application for term graphs, which are capable of representing and performing computation with abstract algebraic structures such as groups, fields and rings.

The TERMGRAPH conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.termgraph.org.uk/ |title=TERMGRAPH}}&lt;/ref&gt; focuses entirely on research into term graph rewriting and its applications.

==Classes of graph grammar and graph rewriting system==
Graph rewriting systems naturally group into classes according to the kind of representation of graphs that are used and how the rewrites are expressed.  The term graph grammar, otherwise equivalent to graph rewriting system or graph replacement system, is most often used in classifications.  Some common types are:
* [[Attributed graph grammar]]s, typically formalised using either the [[single-pushout approach]] or the [[double-pushout approach]] to characterising replacements, mentioned in the above section on the algebraic approach to graph rewriting.
* [[Hypergraph grammar]]s, including as more restrictive subclasses [[port graph grammar]]s, [[linear graph grammar]]s and [[interaction net]]s.

==Implementations and applications==
[[Image:GraphRewriteExample.PNG|thumb|Example for graph rewrite rule (optimization from compiler construction: multiplication with 2 replaced by addition)]]

Graphs are an expressive, visual and mathematically precise formalism for modelling of objects (entities) linked by relations; objects are represented by nodes and relations between them by edges. Nodes and edges are commonly typed and attributed. Computations are described in this model by changes in the relations between the entities or by attribute changes of the graph elements. They are encoded in graph rewrite/graph transformation rules and executed by graph rewrite systems/graph transformation tools.

Katz (1998). ''A History of Mathematics: An Introduction'', p. 184. Addison Wesley, {{isbn|0-321-01618-1}}: "''But what we really want to know is to what extent the Alexandrian mathematicians of the period from the first to the fifth centuries C.E. were Greek. Certainly, all of them wrote in Greek and were part of the Greek intellectual community of Alexandria. And most modern studies conclude that the Greek community coexisted [...] So should we assume that Ptolemy and Diophantus, Pappus and Hypatia were ethnically Greek, that their ancestors had come from Greece at some point in the past but had remained effectively isolated from the Egyptians? It is, of course, impossible to answer this question definitively. But research in papyri dating from the early centuries of the common era demonstrates that a significant amount of intermarriage took place between the Greek and Egyptian communities [...] And it is known that Greek marriage contracts increasingly came to resemble Egyptian ones. In addition, even from the founding of Alexandria, small numbers of Egyptians were admitted to the privileged classes in the city to fulfill numerous civic roles. Of course, it was essential in such cases for the Egyptians to become "Hellenized," to adopt Greek habits and the Greek language. Given that the Alexandrian mathematicians mentioned here were active several hundred years after the founding of the city, it would seem at least equally possible that they were ethnically Egyptian as that they remained ethnically Greek. In any case, it is unreasonable to portray them with purely European features when no physical descriptions exist.''"&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost certain that Hero taught at the [[Musaeum]] which included the famous [[Library of Alexandria]], because most of his writings appear as lecture notes for courses in [[mathematics]], [[mechanics]], [[physics]], and [[pneumatics]]. Although the field was not formalized until the twentieth century, it is thought that the work of Hero, his automated devices in particular, represents some of the first formal research into [[cybernetics]].&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;{{cite book

* The first [[vending machine]] was also one of his constructions; when a coin was introduced via a slot on the top of the machine, a set amount of holy water was dispensed. This was included in his list of inventions in his book ''Mechanics and Optics''. When the coin was deposited, it fell upon a pan attached to a lever. The lever opened up a valve which let some water flow out. The pan continued to tilt with the weight of the coin until it fell off, at which point a counter-weight would snap the lever back up and turn off the valve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Bibliography==
[[File:Hero - De automatis, 1589 - 116959.jpg|thumb|The book ''About [[automata]]'' by Hero of Alexandria (1589 edition)]]

The most comprehensive edition of Hero's works was published in five volumes in Leipzig by the publishing house Teubner in 1903.

Works known to have been written by Hero:
*''Pneumatica'' (Œ†ŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫Œ¨), a description of machines working on [[air]], [[steam]] or [[water]] [[pressure]], including the ''hydraulis'' or [[water organ]]&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Hero of Alexandria and Hydraulis|author=Jamies W. McKinnon|access-date=January 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Automata'', a description of machines which enable wonders in temples by mechanical or pneumatical means (e.g. automatic opening or closing of temple doors, statues that pour wine, etc.); See [[Automaton]] and [[Bernardino Baldi]]'s translation&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8EI8AAAAcAAJ De gli automati, overo machine se moventi, Volume 2] (Venice, 1589; repr. 1601), ''On [[Automaton]]'';  translated from the Greek.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Mechanica'', preserved only in Arabic, written for [[architect]]s, containing means to lift heavy objects
*''Metrica'', a description of how to calculate [[Surface area|surface]]s and [[volume]]s of diverse objects
*''On the Dioptra'', a collection of methods to measure lengths, a work in which the [[odometer]] and the [[dioptra]], an apparatus which resembles the [[theodolite]], are described
*''Belopoeica'', a description of [[mechanized warfare|war machine]]s
*''Catoptrica'', about the progression of [[light]], [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and the use of [[mirror]]s

Works that sometimes have been attributed to Hero, but are now thought most likely to have been written by someone else:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Heron.html | author=O'Connor, J.J. | author2=E.F.

A hexaflake has 7&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt; hexagons in its ''n''th iteration, each smaller by 1/3 than the hexagons in the previous iteration. Its exterior [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] is the [[Koch snowflake|von Koch flake]], and the full boundary contains an infinite number of Koch snowflakes. The [[Hausdorff dimension]] of the hexaflake is equal to ln(7)/ln(3), approximately 1.7712. It may also be constructed by projecting the [[Cantor set|Cantor cube]] onto the plane orthogonal to its main diagonal.

A closely related fractal, the '''Sierpinski hexagon''', is formed by repeatedly replacing each hexagon by six smaller hexagons, omitting the central seventh hexagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

[[Image:Mug and Torus morph.gif|thumb|right|240px|A continuous deformation between a coffee [[mug]] and a donut ([[torus]]) illustrating that they are homeomorphic. But there need not be a [[Homotopy|continuous deformation]] for two spaces to be homeomorphic ‚Äî only a continuous mapping with a continuous inverse function.]]
In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[topology]], a '''homeomorphism''' or '''topological isomorphism''' or '''bi continuous function''' is a [[Continuous function#Continuous functions between topological spaces|continuous function]] between [[topological space]]s that has a continuous [[inverse function]]. Homeomorphisms are the [[isomorphism]]s in the [[category of topological spaces]]&amp;mdash;that is, they are the [[map (mathematics)|mappings]] that preserve all the [[topological property|topological properties]] of a given space. Two spaces with a homeomorphism between them are called '''homeomorphic''', and from a topological viewpoint they are the same. The word ''homeomorphism'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''[[wikt:·ΩÖŒºŒøŒπŒøœÇ|·ΩÖŒºŒøŒπŒøœÇ]]'' (''homoios'') = similar or same and ''[[wikt:ŒºŒøœÅœÜŒÆ|ŒºŒøœÅœÜŒÆ]]'' (''morphƒì'') = shape, form, introduced to mathematics by [[Henri Poincar√©]] in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serge.mehl.free.fr/anx/ana_situs.html|title=Analysis Situs selon Poincar√© (1895)|author=|date=|website=serge.mehl.free.fr|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611022329/http://serge.mehl.free.fr/anx/ana_situs.html|archivedate=11 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gamelin |first=T.

Very roughly speaking, a topological space is a [[geometry|geometric]] object, and the homeomorphism is a continuous stretching and bending of the object into a new shape. Thus, a [[square (geometry)|square]] and a [[circle]] are homeomorphic to each other, but a [[sphere]] and a [[torus]] are not. However, this description can be misleading. Some continuous deformations are not homeomorphisms, such as the deformation of a line into a point. Some homeomorphisms are not continuous deformations, such as the homeomorphism between a [[trefoil knot]] and a circle.

An often-repeated [[mathematical joke]] is that topologists can't tell the difference between a coffee cup and a donut,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Differential Equations: A Dynamical Systems Approach. Part II: Higher-Dimensional Systems|first1=John H.|last1=Hubbard|first2=Beverly H.|last2=West|publisher=Springer|series=Texts in Applied Mathematics|volume=18|year=1995|isbn=978-0-387-94377-0|page=204|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SHBj2oaSALoC&amp;pg=PA204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since a sufficiently pliable donut could be reshaped to the form of a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it, while preserving the donut hole in a cup's handle.

==Definition==
A [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; between two [[topological space]]s is a '''homeomorphism''' if it has the following properties:

* &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a [[bijection]] ([[injective function|one-to-one]] and [[onto]]),
* &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[Continuity (topology)|continuous]],
* the [[inverse function]] &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous (&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is an [[open mapping]]).

A homeomorphism is sometimes called a '''bicontinuous''' function. If such a function exists, we say &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are '''homeomorphic'''. A '''self-homeomorphism''' is a homeomorphism from a topological space onto itself. "Being homeomorphic" is an [[equivalence relation]] on topological spaces. Its [[equivalence class]]es are called '''homeomorphism classes'''.

==Examples==
[[Image:Blue Trefoil Knot.png|thumb|right|240|A [[trefoil knot]] is homeomorphic to a torus, but not [[Homotopy#Isotopy|isotopic]] in  '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Continuous mappings are not always realizable as deformations.]]
* The open [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; is homeomorphic to the [[real number]]s &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math display="inline"&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;. (In this case, a bicontinuous forward mapping is given by &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f(x) = \frac{1}{a-x} + \frac{1}{b-x} &lt;/math&gt; while other such mappings are given by scaled and translated versions of the {{math|tan}} or {{math|arg tanh}} functions).
* The unit 2-[[ball (mathematics)|disc]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;D^2&lt;/math&gt; and the [[unit square]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are homeomorphic; since the unit disc can be deformed into the unit square. An example of a bicontinuous mapping from the square to the disc is, in [[polar coordinates]], &lt;math&gt;(\rho, \theta) \mapsto \left( \rho \max(|\cos \theta|, |\sin \theta|), \theta\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
* The [[graph of a function|graph]] of a [[differentiable function]] is homeomorphic to the [[domain of a function|domain]] of the function.
* A differentiable [[parametric equation|parametrization]] of a [[curve]] is a homeomorphism between the domain of the parametrization and the curve.
* A [[chart (topology)|chart]] of a [[manifold]] is an homeomorphism between an [[open subset]] of the manifold and an open subset of a [[Euclidean space]].
* The [[stereographic projection]] is a homeomorphism between the unit sphere in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with a single point removed and the set of all points in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (a 2-dimensional [[plane (mathematics)|plane]]). 
* If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a [[topological group]], its inversion map &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a homeomorphism. Also, for any &lt;math&gt;x \in G&lt;/math&gt;, the left translation &lt;math&gt;y \mapsto xy&lt;/math&gt;, the right translation &lt;math&gt;y \mapsto yx&lt;/math&gt;, and the inner automorphism &lt;math&gt;y \mapsto xyx^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; are homeomorphisms.

===Non-examples===
* '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; and '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; are not homeomorphic for {{nowrap|1=''m'' &amp;ne; ''n''.}}
* The Euclidean [[real line]] is not homeomorphic to the unit circle as a subspace of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt;, since the unit circle is [[Compact space|compact]] as a subspace of Euclidean '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt; but the real line is not compact.

==Notes==
The third requirement, that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; be continuous, is essential. Consider for instance the function &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f : [0,2\pi) \to S^1&lt;/math&gt; (the [[unit circle]] in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;) defined by&lt;math display="inline"&gt;f(\phi) = (\cos\phi,\sin\phi)&lt;/math&gt;. This function is bijective and continuous, but not a homeomorphism (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; is compact but &lt;math display="inline"&gt;[0,2\pi)&lt;/math&gt; is not). The function &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is not continuous at the point &lt;math display="inline"&gt;(1,0)&lt;/math&gt;, because although &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; maps &lt;math display="inline"&gt;(1,0)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, any [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of this point also includes points that the function maps close to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;, but the points it maps to numbers in between lie outside the neighbourhood.&lt;ref&gt;V√§is√§l√§, Jussi: ''Topologia I'', Limes RY 1999, p. 63. {{ISBN|951-745-184-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeomorphisms are the [[isomorphism]]s in the [[category of topological spaces]]. As such, the composition of two homeomorphisms is again a homeomorphism, and the set of all self-homeomorphisms &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X \to X&lt;/math&gt; forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]], called the '''[[homeomorphism group]]''' of ''X'', often denoted &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\text{Homeo}(X)&lt;/math&gt;. This group can be given a topology, such as the [[compact-open topology]], which under certain assumptions makes it a [[topological group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dijkstra|first1=Jan J.|title=On Homeomorphism Groups and the Compact-Open Topology|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|date=1 December 2005|volume=112|issue=10|pages=910|doi=10.2307/30037630|url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~dijkstra/research/papers/2005compactopen.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916112245/http://www.cs.vu.nl/~dijkstra/research/papers/2005compactopen.pdf|archivedate=16 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some purposes, the homeomorphism group happens to be too big, but by means of the [[Homotopy#Isotopy|isotopy]] relation, one can reduce this group to the [[mapping class group]].

Similarly, as usual in category theory, given two spaces that are homeomorphic, the space of homeomorphisms between them, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\text{Homeo}(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt;, is a [[torsor]] for the homeomorphism groups &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\text{Homeo}(X)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\text{Homeo}(Y)&lt;/math&gt;, and, given a specific homeomorphism between &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, all three sets are identified.

==Properties==
* Two homeomorphic spaces share the same [[topological property|topological properties]]. For example, if one of them is [[compact space|compact]], then the other is as well; if one of them is [[connectedness|connected]], then the other is as well; if one of them is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], then the other is as well; their [[homotopy]] and [[homology group]]s will coincide. Note however that this does not extend to properties defined via a [[metric space|metric]]; there are metric spaces that are homeomorphic even though one of them is [[completeness (topology)|complete]] and the other is not.
* A homeomorphism is simultaneously an [[open mapping]] and a [[closed mapping]]; that is, it maps [[open set]]s to open sets and [[closed set]]s to closed sets.
* Every self-homeomorphism in &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; can be extended to a self-homeomorphism of the whole disk &lt;math&gt;D^2&lt;/math&gt; ([[Alexander's trick]]).

==Informal discussion==
The intuitive criterion of stretching, bending, cutting and gluing back together takes a certain amount of practice to apply correctly&amp;mdash;it may not be obvious from the description above that deforming a [[line segment]] to a point is impermissible, for instance. It is thus important to realize that it is the formal definition given above that counts. In this case, for example, the line segment possesses infinitely many points, and therefore cannot be put into a bijection with a set containing only a finite number of points, including a single point.

This characterization of a homeomorphism often leads to a confusion with the concept of [[homotopy]], which is actually ''defined'' as a continuous deformation, but from one ''function'' to another, rather than one space to another. In the case of a homeomorphism, envisioning a continuous deformation is a mental tool for keeping track of which points on space ''X'' correspond to which points on ''Y''&amp;mdash;one just follows them as ''X'' deforms. In the case of homotopy, the continuous deformation from one map to the other is of the essence, and it is also less restrictive, since none of the maps involved need to be one-to-one or onto. Homotopy does lead to a relation on spaces: [[homotopy equivalence]].

There is a name for the kind of deformation involved in visualizing a homeomorphism. It is (except when cutting and regluing are required) an [[homotopy|isotopy]] between the [[identity function|identity map]] on ''X'' and the homeomorphism from ''X'' to ''Y''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11119">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] areas of [[order theory|order]] and [[lattice theory]], the '''Knaster‚ÄìTarski theorem''', named after [[Bronis≈Çaw Knaster]] and [[Alfred Tarski]], states the following:

:''Let L be a [[complete lattice]] and let f : L ‚Üí L be an [[order-preserving function]]. Then the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s of f in L is also a complete lattice.''

It was Tarski who stated the result in its most general form,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Alfred Tarski | url=http://projecteuclid.org/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/euclid.pjm/1103044538 | title=A lattice-theoretical fixpoint theorem and its applications | journal = Pacific Journal of Mathematics | volume=5:2 | year=1955 | pages=285&amp;ndash;309}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so the theorem is often known as '''Tarski's fixed point theorem'''. Some time earlier, Knaster and Tarski established the result for the special case where ''L'' is the lattice of subsets of a set, the [[power set]] lattice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=B. Knaster | title=Un th√©or√®me sur les fonctions d'ensembles | journal=Ann. Soc. Polon. Math. | year=1928 | volume=6 | pages=133&amp;ndash;134}} With A. Tarski.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorem has important applications in [[formal semantics of programming languages]] and [[abstract interpretation]].

A kind of [[converse (logic)|converse]] of this theorem was proved by Anne C. Davis: If every order preserving function ''f : L ‚Üí L'' on a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] ''L'' has a fixed point, then ''L'' is a complete lattice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Anne C. Davis | url=http://projecteuclid.org/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/euclid.pjm/1103044539 | title=A characterization of complete lattices | journal=Pacific J. Math. | year=1955 | volume=5 | pages=311&amp;ndash;319 | doi=10.2140/pjm.1955.5.311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences: least and greatest fixed points==

Since complete lattices cannot be [[empty set|empty]] (they must contain supremum of empty set), the theorem in particular guarantees the existence of at least one fixed point of ''f'', and even the existence of a ''least'' (or ''greatest'') fixed point. In many practical cases, this is the most important implication of the theorem.

The [[least fixpoint]] of ''f'' is the least element ''x'' such that ''f''(''x'') = ''x'', or, equivalently, such that ''f''(''x'') ‚â§ ''x''; the [[duality (order theory)|dual]] holds for the [[greatest fixpoint]], the greatest element ''x'' such that ''f''(''x'') = ''x''.

If ''f''(lim ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)=lim ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) for all ascending sequences ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, then the least fixpoint of ''f'' is lim ''f''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(0) where 0 is the least element of L, thus giving a more "constructive" version of the theorem. (See: [[Kleene fixed-point theorem]].) More generally, if ''f'' is monotonic, then the least fixpoint of ''f'' is the stationary limit of ''f''&lt;sup&gt;Œ±&lt;/sup&gt;(0), taking Œ± over the [[ordinal number|ordinals]], where ''f''&lt;sup&gt;Œ±&lt;/sup&gt; is defined by [[transfinite induction]]: ''f''&lt;sup&gt;Œ±+1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''f'' ( ''f''&lt;sup&gt;Œ±&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''f''&lt;sup&gt;Œ≥&lt;/sup&gt; for a limit ordinal Œ≥ is the [[least upper bound]] of the ''f''&lt;sup&gt;Œ≤&lt;/sup&gt; for all Œ≤ ordinals less than Œ≥. The dual theorem holds for the greatest fixpoint.

For example, in theoretical [[computer science]], [[least fixed point]]s of [[monotone function]]s are used to define [[program semantics]]. Often a more specialized version of the theorem is used, where ''L'' is assumed to be the lattice of all [[subset]]s of a certain set ordered by subset inclusion. This reflects the fact that in many applications only such lattices are considered. One then usually is looking for the smallest set that has the property of being a fixed point of the function ''f''. [[Abstract interpretation]] makes ample use of the Knaster‚ÄìTarski theorem and the formulas giving the least and greatest fixpoints.

Knaster‚ÄìTarski theorem can be used for a simple proof of the [[Schr√∂der‚ÄìBernstein theorem|Cantor‚ÄìBernstein‚ÄìSchroeder theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;Example 3 in R. Uhl, "[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TarskisFixedPointTheorem.html Tarski's Fixed Point Theorem]", from ''MathWorld''--a Wolfram Web Resource, created by Eric W. Weisstein.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davey|first1=Brian A.|last2=Priestley|first2=Hilary A.|authorlink2=Hilary Priestley|title=Introduction to Lattices and Order|edition=2nd|pages=63,4|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2002|isbn=9780521784511|url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/mathematics/algebra/introduction-lattices-and-order-2nd-edition?format=PB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weaker versions of the theorem==

Weaker versions of the Knaster‚ÄìTarski theorem can be formulated for ordered sets, but involve more complicated assumptions. For example:

:''Let L be a [[partially ordered set]] with the smallest element (bottom) and let f : L ‚Üí L be an [[monotonic function|order-preserving]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]. Further, suppose there exists u in L such that f(u) ‚â§ u and that any [[Total_order#Chains|chain]] in the subset {x in L : x ‚â§ f(x), x ‚â§ u} has supremum. Then f admits a least [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]].''

This can be applied to obtain various theorems on [[invariant set]]s, e.g. the Ok's theorem:

:''For the monotone map F : P(X) ‚Üí P(X) on the [[powerset|family]] of (closed) nonempty subsets of X the following are equivalent: (o) F admits A in P(X) s.t. &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq F(A)&lt;/math&gt;, (i) F admits invariant set A in P(X) i.e. &lt;math&gt;A = F(A)&lt;/math&gt;, (ii) F admits maximal invariant set A, (iii) F admits the greatest invariant set A.''

In particular, using the Knaster-Tarski principle one can develop the theory of global attractors for noncontractive discontinuous (multivalued) [[iterated function system]]s. For weakly contractive iterated function systems [[Kantorovitch fixpoint theorem]] suffices.

Other applications of fixed point principles for ordered sets come from the theory of differential, integral and operator equations.

==Proof==

Let's restate the theorem.

For a complete lattice &lt;math&gt;\langle L, \le \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and a monotone function &lt;math&gt;f\colon L \rightarrow L&lt;/math&gt; on ''L'', the set of all fixpoints of ''f'' is also a complete lattice &lt;math&gt;\langle P, \le \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, with:
* &lt;math&gt;\bigvee P = \bigvee \{ x \in L \mid x \le f(x) \}&lt;/math&gt; as the greatest fixpoint of ''f''
* &lt;math&gt;\bigwedge P = \bigwedge \{ x \in L \mid x \ge f(x) \}&lt;/math&gt; as the least fixpoint of ''f''.

''Proof.'' We begin by showing that ''P'' has least and greatest element. Let ''D'' = { ''x'' | ''x'' ‚â§ ''f(x)'' } and ''x'' ‚àà ''D'' (we know that at least ''0&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' belongs to ''D''). Then because ''f'' is monotone we have ''f(x)'' ‚â§ ''f(f(x))'', that is ''f(x)'' ‚àà ''D''.

Now let &lt;math&gt;u = \bigvee D&lt;/math&gt; (u exists because ''D'' ‚äÜ ''L''). Then for all ''x'' ‚àà ''D'' it is true that ''x'' ‚â§ ''u'' and ''f(x)'' ‚â§ ''f(u)'', so ''x'' ‚â§ ''f(x)'' ‚â§ ''f(u)''. Therefore, ''f(u)'' is an upper bound of ''D'', but ''u'' is the least upper bound, so ''u'' ‚â§ ''f(u)'', i.e. ''u'' ‚àà ''D''. Then ''f(u)'' ‚àà ''D'' (because ''f(u)'' ‚â§ ''f(f(u))'') and so ''f(u)'' ‚â§ ''u'' from which follows ''f(u)'' = ''u''. Because every fixpoint is in ''D'' we have that ''u'' is the greatest fixpoint of ''f''.

The function ''f'' is monotone on the dual (complete) lattice &lt;math&gt;\langle L^{op}, \ge \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. As we have just proved, its greatest fixpoint there exists. It is the least one on ''L'', so ''P'' has least and greatest elements, or more generally that every monotone function on a complete lattice has least and greatest fixpoints.

If ''a'' ‚àà ''L'' and ''b'' ‚àà ''L'', we'll write [''a'', ''b''] for the closed interval with bounds ''a'' and ''b'': { x ‚àà ''L'' | ''a'' ‚â§ x ‚â§ ''b'' }. If ''a'' ‚â§ ''b'', then [''a'', ''b''] is a complete lattice.

It remains to be proven that P is a complete lattice. Let &lt;math&gt;1_L = \bigvee L&lt;/math&gt;, ''W'' ‚äÜ ''P'' and &lt;math&gt;w = \bigvee W&lt;/math&gt;. We‚Ä≤ll show that ''f''([''w'', ''1&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'']) ‚äÜ [''w'', ''1&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'']. Indeed, for every ''x'' ‚àà ''W'' we have ''x'' = ''f(x)'' ‚â§ ''f(w)''.  Since ''w'' is the least upper bound of ''W'', ''w'' ‚â§ ''f(w)''. Then from ''y'' ‚àà [''w'', ''1&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''] follows that ''w'' ‚â§ ''f(w)'' ‚â§ ''f(y)'', giving ''f(y)'' ‚àà [''w'', ''1&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''] or simply ''f''([''w'', ''1&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'']) ‚äÜ [''w'', ''1&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'']. This allows us to look at ''f'' as a function on the complete lattice [''w'', ''1&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'']. Then it has a least fixpoint there, giving us the least upper bound of ''W''. We‚Ä≤ve shown that an arbitrary subset of ''P'' has a supremum, which turns ''P'' into a complete lattice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1726">In [[mathematical analysis]], '''Lambert summation''' is a summability method for a class of [[divergent series]].

==Definition==
A series &lt;math&gt;\sum a_n&lt;/math&gt; is ''Lambert summable'' to ''A'', written &lt;math&gt;\sum a_n = A \,(\mathrm{L})&lt;/math&gt;, if

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{r \rightarrow 1-} (1-r) \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n a_n r^n}{1-r^n} = A . &lt;/math&gt;

If a series is convergent to ''A'' then it is Lambert summable to ''A'' (an [[Abelian theorem]]).

==Examples==

* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\mu(n)}{n} = 0 (\mathrm{L})&lt;/math&gt;, where &amp;mu; is the [[M√∂bius function]].  Hence if this series converges at all, it converges to zero.

This is a list of some of the most commonly used coordinate transformations.

==2-dimensional==
Let (x, y) be the standard [[Cartesian coordinates]], and r and Œ∏ the standard [[polar coordinates]].

===To Cartesian coordinates ===
====From polar coordinates ====
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  x &amp;= r\,\cos\theta \\
  y &amp;= r\,\sin\theta \\
  \frac{\partial(x, y)}{\partial(r, \theta)} &amp;= \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos\theta &amp; -r\,\sin\theta  \\
    \sin\theta &amp;  r\,\cos\theta
  \end{pmatrix} \\
  \det{\frac{\partial(x, y)}{\partial(r, \theta)}} &amp;= r
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

====From log-polar coordinates====
{{Main|log-polar coordinates}}

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  x &amp;= e^\rho\cos\theta, \\
  y &amp;= e^\rho\sin\theta.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

By using complex numbers &lt;math&gt;(x, y) = x + iy'&lt;/math&gt;, the transformation can be written as
:&lt;math&gt; x + iy = e^{\rho + i\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

I.e., it is given by the complex exponential function.

====From bipolar coordinates====
{{Main|bipolar coordinates}}
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  x &amp;= a \frac{\sinh \tau}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma} \\
  y &amp;= a \frac{\sin \sigma}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

====From 2-center bipolar coordinates====
{{Main|two-center bipolar coordinates}}
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  x &amp;= \frac{1}{4c}\left(r_1^2 - r_2^2\right) \\
  y &amp;= \pm \frac{1}{4c}\sqrt{16c^2 r_1^2 - (r_1^2 - r_2^2 + 4c^2)^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

====From Ces√†ro equation====
{{Main|Ces√†ro equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  x &amp;= \int \cos \left[\int \kappa(s) \,ds\right] ds \\
  y &amp;= \int \sin \left[\int \kappa(s) \,ds\right] ds
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===To polar coordinates===
====From Cartesian coordinates====
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
              r &amp;= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\
  \theta^\prime &amp;= \arctan\left|\frac{y}{x}\right|
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Note: solving for &lt;math&gt;\theta^\prime&lt;/math&gt; returns the resultant angle in the first quadrant (&lt;math&gt;0&lt;\theta&lt;\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;). To find &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, one must refer to the original Cartesian coordinate, determine the quadrant in which &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; lies (ex (3,-3) [Cartesian] lies in QIV), then use the following to solve for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;:

*For &lt;math&gt;\theta^\prime&lt;/math&gt; in QI:
*:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \theta^\prime&lt;/math&gt;
*For &lt;math&gt;\theta^\prime&lt;/math&gt; in QII:
*:&lt;math&gt;\theta= \pi - \theta^\prime&lt;/math&gt;
*For &lt;math&gt;\theta^\prime&lt;/math&gt; in QIII:
*:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi + \theta^\prime &lt;/math&gt;
*For &lt;math&gt;\theta^\prime&lt;/math&gt; in QIV:
*:&lt;math&gt;\theta = 2\pi - \theta^\prime &lt;/math&gt;

The value for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; must be solved for in this manner because for all values of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tan\theta&lt;/math&gt; is only defined for &lt;math&gt;-\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;\theta&lt;+\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, and is periodic (with period &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;). This means that the inverse function will only give values in the domain of the function, but restricted to a single period. Hence, the range of the inverse function is only half a full circle.

Note that one can also use
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
              r &amp;= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\
  \theta^\prime &amp;= 2 \arctan \frac{y}{x + r}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

====From 2-center bipolar coordinates====
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       r &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{r_1^2 + r_2^2 - 2c^2}{2}} \\
  \theta &amp;= \arctan \left[\sqrt{\frac{8c^2(r_1^2 + r_2^2 - 2c^2)}{r_1^2 - r_2^2} - 1}\right]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Where 2''c'' is the distance between the poles.

===To log-polar coordinates from Cartesian coordinates===
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \rho &amp;= \log\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \\
  \theta &amp;= \arctan \frac{y}{x}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Arc-length and curvature===
====In Cartesian coordinates====
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \kappa &amp;= \frac{x'y'' - y'x''}{({x'}^2 + {y'}^2)^\frac{3}{2}} \\
       s &amp;= \int_a^t \sqrt{{x'}^2 + {y'}^2}\, dt
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

====In polar coordinates====
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \kappa &amp;= \frac{r^2 + 2{r'}^2 - rr''}{(r^2 + {r'}^2)^\frac{3}{2}} \\
       s &amp;= \int_a^\phi \sqrt{r^2 + {r'}^2}\, d\phi
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==3-dimensional==
Let (x, y, z) be the standard Cartesian coordinates, and (œÅ, Œ∏, œÜ) the [[spherical coordinates]], with Œ∏ the angle measured away from the +Z axis (as [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:3D_Spherical.svg], see conventions in [[spherical coordinates]]). As œÜ has a range of 360¬∞ the same considerations as in polar (2 dimensional) coordinates apply whenever an arctangent of it is taken. Œ∏ has a range of 180¬∞, running from 0¬∞ to 180¬∞, and does not pose any problem when calculated from an arccosine, but beware for an arctangent. 

If, in the alternative definition, ''Œ∏'' is chosen to run from ‚àí90¬∞ to +90¬∞, in opposite direction of the earlier definition, it can be found uniquely from an arcsine, but beware of an arccotangent. In this case in all formulas below all arguments in ''Œ∏'' should have sine and cosine exchanged, and as derivative also a plus and minus exchanged.

All divisions by zero result in special cases of being directions along one of the main axes and are in practice most easily solved by observation.

===To Cartesian coordinates===
====From spherical coordinates====
{{Main|spherical coordinates}}
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  x &amp;= \rho \, \sin\theta \, \cos\phi \\
  y &amp;= \rho \, \sin\theta \, \sin\phi \\
  z &amp;= \rho \, \cos\theta \\
  \frac{\partial(x, y, z)}{\partial(\rho, \theta, \phi)}
    &amp;= \begin{pmatrix}
         \sin\theta\cos\phi &amp;  \rho\cos\theta\cos\phi &amp; -\rho\sin\theta\sin\phi \\
         \sin\theta\sin\phi &amp;  \rho\cos\theta\sin\phi &amp;  \rho\sin\theta\cos\phi \\
         \cos\theta         &amp; -\rho\sin\theta         &amp;  0
       \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

So for the volume element:
:&lt;math&gt;
  dx\;dy\;dz = \det{\frac{\partial(x, y, z)}{\partial(\rho, \theta, \phi)}} d\rho\;d\theta\;d\phi
             = \rho^2 \sin\theta \; d\rho \; d\theta \; d\phi
&lt;/math&gt;

====From cylindrical coordinates====
{{Main|cylindrical coordinates}}
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  x &amp;= r \, \cos\theta \\
  y &amp;= r \, \sin\theta \\
  z &amp;= z \, \\
  \frac{\partial(x, y, z)}{\partial(r, \theta, z)}
    &amp;= \begin{pmatrix}
         \cos\theta &amp; -r\sin\theta &amp; 0 \\
         \sin\theta &amp;  r\cos\theta &amp; 0 \\
                  0 &amp;            0 &amp; 1
       \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

So for the volume element:
:&lt;math&gt;
  dV = dx\;dy\;dz = \det{\frac{\partial(x, y, z)}{\partial(r, \theta, z)}} dr\;d\theta\;dz
             = r \; dr \; d\theta \; dz
&lt;/math&gt;

===To spherical coordinates===
====From Cartesian coordinates====
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \rho   &amp;= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \\
  \theta &amp;= \arctan \left( \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{z} \right)=\arccos \left( {\frac{z}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}} \right) \\
  \phi   &amp;= \arctan \left( {\frac{y}{x}} \right) = \arccos \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\right) = \arcsin \left( \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\right) \\
  \frac{\partial\left(\rho, \theta, \phi\right)}{\partial\left(x, y, z\right)}
         &amp;= \begin{pmatrix}
              \frac{x}{\rho}                    &amp; \frac{y}{\rho}                    &amp;  \frac{z}{\rho} \\
              \frac{xz}{\rho^2\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} &amp; \frac{yz}{\rho^2\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{\rho^2} \\
              \frac{-y}{x^2 + y^2}              &amp; \frac{x}{x^2 + y^2}               &amp;  0 \\
            \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

See also the article on [[atan2]] for how to elegantly handle some edge cases.

So for the element:
:&lt;math&gt;d\rho\ d\theta\ d\phi=\det\frac{\partial(\rho,\theta,\phi)}{\partial(x,y,z)}dx\ dy\ dz=\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}dx\ dy\ dz&lt;/math&gt;

====From cylindrical coordinates====
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \rho   &amp;= \sqrt{r^2 + h^2} \\
  \theta &amp;= \theta \\
  \phi   &amp;= \arctan\frac{r}{h} \\
  \frac{\partial(\rho, \theta, \phi)}{\partial(r, h, \phi)}
         &amp;= \begin{pmatrix}
              \frac{r}{\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}} &amp; \frac{h}{\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}} &amp; 0  \\
              \frac{h}{r^2 + h^2}        &amp; \frac{-r}{r^2 + h^2}       &amp; 0  \\
              0                          &amp; 0                          &amp; 1 \\
            \end{pmatrix} \\
  \det \frac{\partial(\rho, \theta, \phi)}{\partial(r, h, \phi)}
         &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{r^2+h^2}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===To cylindrical coordinates===
====From Cartesian coordinates====
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       r &amp;= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\
  \theta &amp;= \arctan{\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)} \\
       z &amp;= z \quad
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial(r, \theta, h)}{\partial(x, y, z)} =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} &amp; \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} &amp; 0 \\
      \frac{-y}{x^2 + y^2}       &amp; \frac{x}{x^2+y^2}          &amp; 0 \\
      0                          &amp; 0                          &amp; 1
    \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note: this section needs updating for consistency with nomenclature. A diagram should be included for this article showing what each variable represents. Usually \theta represents the polar angle for spherical coordinates and \phi the azimuthal angle for cylindrical coordinates. Here the two are mixed and could cause confusion. Someone please update.  [respeonse] Note that the conventions in physics and pure mathematics differ.  This page should probably distinguish this issue itself, as is stated clearly on the wikipedia page for spherical coordinate system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8007">'''Metagame analysis''' involves framing a problem situation as a strategic [[game]] in which participants try to realise their objectives by means of the options available to them. The subsequent meta-analysis of this game gives insight in possible strategies and their outcome.

==Origin==
Metagame theory was developed by Nigel Howard in the 1960s as a reconstruction of mathematical [[game theory]] on a non-quantitative basis, hoping that it would thereby make more practical and intuitive sense {{Harvard citation|Howard|1971|pp=xi}}. Metagame analysis reflects on a [[problem]] in terms of decision issues, and stakeholders who may exert different options to gain control over these issues. The analysis reveals what likely [[scenario]]s exist, and who has the power to control the course of events. The practical application of metagame theory is based on the analysis of options method, first applied to study problems like the strategic [[arms race]] and [[nuclear proliferation]].

==Method==
Metagame analysis proceeds in three phases: analysis of options, scenario development, and scenario analysis.

===Analysis of options===
The first phase of analysis of options consists of the following four steps:

#Structure the problem by identifying the issues to be decided.
#Identify the stakeholders who control the issues, either directly or indirectly.
#Make an inventory of policy options by means of which the stakeholders control the issues.
#Determine the dependencies between the policy options.

The dependencies between options should typically be formulated as "option X can only be implemented if option Y is also implemented", or "options Y and Z are mutually exclusive". The result is a [[metagame]] model, which can then be analysed in different ways.

===Scenario development===
The possible outcomes of the game, based on the combination of options, are called [[scenario]]s. In theory, a game with N stakeholders s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., s&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; who have Oi options (i = 1, ..., N), there are O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;√ó...√óO&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; possible outcomes. As the number of stakeholders and the number of the options they have increase, the number of scenarios will increase steeply due to a [[combinatorial explosion]]. Conversely, the dependencies between options will reduce the number of scenarios, because they rule out those containing logically or physically impossible combinations of options.

If the set of feasible scenarios is too large to be analysed in full, some combinations may be eliminated because the analyst judges them to be not worth considering. When doing so, the analyst should take care to preserve these particular types of scenarios {{Harvard citation|Howard|1989|pp=243 ff}}:

*The [[status quo|Status Quo]], representing the future as it was previously expected.
*The present scenario, which may differ from the Status Quo as it incorporates the intentions that are expressed by the stakeholders to change their plans; the Status Quo necessarily remains the same, but the present scenario may change as stakeholders interact and influence each other's plans.
*The positions of different stakeholders, being the scenarios they would like others to agree to. Similar to the present scenario, positions may change through interaction.
*[[Compromise]]s between two stakeholders, defined as scenarios that, while not the position of either, are preferred by both to the other‚Äôs position. A compromise does not necessarily have to involve all stakeholders.
*Conflict points, defined as scenarios that stakeholders might move to in trying to force others to accept their positions.

===Scenario analysis===
The next step in the metagame analysis consists of the actual analysis of the scenarios generated so far. This analysis centres around stability and is broken down in the following four steps {{Harvard citation|Howard|1989|pp=248‚Äì255}}:
#Choose a particular scenario to analyse for stability. A scenario is stable if "each stakeholder expects to do its part and expects others to do theirs." Note that stable scenarios are accepted by all stakeholders, but that acceptance does not need to be voluntary. There may be more than one stable scenario, the stability of a scenario may change, and unstable scenarios can also happen.
#Identify all unilateral improvements for stakeholders and subsets of stakeholders from the particular scenario. These are all the scenarios that are both preferred by all members of a certain subset and 'reachable' by them alone changing their selection of individual options.
#Identify all sanctions that exist to deter the unilateral improvements. A sanction against an improvement is a possible reaction to an improvement by the stakeholders who were not involved in the improvement. It is such that the stakeholder who was involved in the improvement finds the sanction not preferred to the particular scenario, making it not worthwhile for that stakeholder to have helped with the improvement. The general "law of stability" to be used in scenario analysis is: for a scenario to be stable, it is necessary for each credible improvement to be deterred by a credible sanction {{Harvard citation|Howard|1989|pp=251}}&lt;br&gt;Steps 1 to 3 need to be repeated to analyse some additional scenarios. When a number of scenarios have been analysed, one can proceed to the next step:
#Draw a strategic map, laying out all the threats and promises stakeholders can make to try to stabilise the situation at scenarios they prefer. Strategic maps are diagrams in which scenarios are shown by balloons, with arrows from one balloon to another representing unilateral improvements. Dotted arrows from improvement arrows to balloons represent sanctions by which the improvements may be deterred, thus changing the destination of the improvement arrow.

This analysis procedure shows that the credibility of threats and promises (sanctions and improvements) is of importance in metagame analysis. A threat or promise, one that the stakeholder prefers to carry out for its own sake, is inherently credible. Sometimes a stakeholder may want to make credible an 'involuntary' threat or promise, to use this to move the situation in the desired direction. Such threats and promises can be made credible in three basic ways: preference change, irrationality, and deceit {{Harvard citation|Howard|1989|pp=257}}.

==Development==
Metagame analysis is still used as a technique in its own right.  However it has been further developed in distinct ways as the basis of more recent approaches:
* the graph model
* [[confrontation analysis]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4932">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''n''! conjecture}}
In mathematics, the '''''n''! conjecture''' is the [[conjecture]] that the [[dimension]] of a certain [[bi-graded]] [[Module (mathematics)|module]] of [[diagonal harmonics]] is ''n''!. It was made by [[A. M. Garsia]] and [[M. Haiman]] and later proved by [[M. Haiman]]. It implies [[Ian G. Macdonald|Macdonald]]'s [[Macdonald polynomial#The Macdonald positivity conjecture|positivity conjecture]] about the [[Macdonald polynomial]]s.

==Formulation and background==
The Macdonald polynomials &lt;math&gt; P_\lambda &lt;/math&gt; are a two-parameter family of [[orthogonal polynomials]] indexed by a positive weight Œª of a [[root system]], introduced by [[Ian G. Macdonald]] (1987). They generalize several other families of orthogonal polynomials, such as [[Jack polynomial]]s and [[Hall‚ÄìLittlewood polynomial]]s. They are known to have deep relationships with [[affine Hecke algebra]]s and [[Hilbert scheme]]s, which were used to prove several conjectures made by Macdonald about them.

{{harvtxt|Macdonald|1988}} introduced a new basis for the space of [[symmetric function]]s, which specializes to many of the well-known bases for the symmetric functions, by suitable substitutions for the parameters ''q'' and ''t''.

In fact, we can obtain in this manner the [[Schur polynomial|Schur functions]], the Hall‚ÄìLittlewood symmetric functions, the Jack symmetric functions, the [[zonal symmetric function]]s, the [[zonal spherical function]]s, and the elementary and monomial symmetric functions.

The so-called (''q'',''t'')-[[Kostka polynomial]]s are the coefficients of a resulting [[Stochastic matrix|transition matrix]]. Macdonald conjectured that they are polynomials in ''q'' and ''t'', with non-negative integer coefficients.

It was [[Adriano Garsia]]'s idea to construct an appropriate [[module (algebra)|module]] in order to prove positivity (as was done in his previous joint work with [[Claudio Procesi|Procesi]] on Schur positivity of [[Kostka‚ÄìFoulkes polynomials]]).

In an attempt to prove Macdonald's conjecture, {{harvtxt|Garsia|Haiman|1993}} introduced the bi-graded module  &lt;math&gt;H_\mu &lt;/math&gt; of [[diagonal harmonic]]s and conjectured that the (modified) Macdonald polynomials are the Frobenius image of the character generating function of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;mu;&lt;/sub&gt;, under the diagonal action of the [[symmetric group]].

The proof of Macdonald's conjecture was then reduced to the ''n''! conjecture; i.e., to prove that the dimension of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;mu;&lt;/sub&gt; is&amp;nbsp;''n''!.  In 2001, Haiman proved that the dimension is indeed ''n''! (see [4]).

This breakthrough led to the discovery of many hidden connections and new aspects of [[symmetric group representation theory]], as well as combinatorial objects (e.g., insertion tableaux, Haglund's inversion numbers, and the role of parking functions in representation theory).

In [[mathematics]], an '''operation''' is a calculation from zero or more input values (called ''[[operand]]s'') to an output value. The number of operands is the [[arity]] of the operation. The most commonly studied operations are [[binary operation]]s, (that is, operations of arity&amp;nbsp;2) such as [[addition]] and [[multiplication]], and [[unary operation]]s (operations of arity&amp;nbsp;1), such as [[additive inverse]] and [[multiplicative inverse]]. An operation of arity zero, or [[nullary operation]], is a [[constant (mathematics)|constant]]. The [[mixed product]] is an example of an operation of arity&amp;nbsp;3, also called [[ternary operation]]. Generally, the arity is supposed to be finite. However, [[infinitary operation]]s are sometimes considered, in which context the "usual" operations of finite arity are called '''finitary operations'''.

==Types of operation==
[[File:Binary operations as black box.svg|thumb|A binary operation takes two arguments &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and returns the result &lt;math&gt;x\circ y&lt;/math&gt;]]
There are two common types of operations: [[unary operation|unary]] and [[binary operation|binary]]. Unary operations involve only one value, such as [[negation]] and [[trigonometric function]]s. Binary operations, on the other hand, take two values, and include [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], and [[exponentiation]].

Operations can involve mathematical objects other than numbers. The [[Truth value|logical values]] ''true'' and ''false'' can be combined using [[logic operation]]s, such as ''and'', ''or,'' and ''not''. [[vector (geometric)|Vectors]] can be added and subtracted. [[Rotation]]s can be combined using the [[function composition]] operation, performing the first rotation and then the second. Operations on [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] include the binary operations ''[[union (mathematics)|union]]'' and ''[[intersection (mathematics)|intersection]]'' and the unary operation of ''[[complementation (mathematics)|complementation]]''. Operations on [[function (mathematics)|function]]s include [[Function composition|composition]] and [[convolution]].

Operations may not be defined for every possible value. For example, in the real numbers one cannot divide by zero or take square roots of negative numbers. The values for which an operation is defined form a set called its ''[[domain (mathematics)|domain]]''. The set which contains the values produced is called the ''[[codomain]]'', but the set of actual values attained by the operation is its ''[[range (mathematics)|range]]''. For example, in the real numbers, the squaring operation only produces non-negative numbers; the codomain is the set of real numbers, but the range is the non-negative numbers.

Operations can involve dissimilar objects. A vector can be multiplied by a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] to form another vector. And the [[inner product]] operation on two vectors produces a scalar. An operation may or may not have certain properties, for example it may be [[associative]], [[commutative]], [[anticommutative]], [[idempotent]], and so on.

The values combined are called ''operands'', ''arguments'', or ''inputs'', and the value produced is called the ''value'', ''result'', or ''output''. Operations can have fewer or more than two inputs.

An operation is like an '''operator''', but the point of view is different. For instance, one often speaks of "the operation of addition" or "addition operation" when focusing on the operands and result, but one says "addition operator" (rarely "operator of addition") when focusing on the process, or from the more abstract viewpoint, the function {{nowrap|+ : ''S'' √ó ''S'' ‚Üí ''S''}}.

==Definition==
An '''operation''' œâ is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the form {{nowrap|œâ : ''V'' ‚Üí ''Y''}}, where {{nowrap|''V'' ‚äÇ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; √ó ... √ó ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The sets ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are called the ''domains'' of the operation, the set ''Y'' is called the ''codomain'' of the operation, and the fixed non-negative integer ''k'' (the number of arguments) is called the ''type'' or ''[[arity]]'' of the operation. Thus a [[unary operation]] has arity one, and a [[binary operation]] has arity two. An operation of arity zero, called a ''nullary'' operation, is simply an element of the codomain ''Y''. An operation of arity ''k'' is called a ''k''-ary operation. Thus a ''k''-ary operation is a (''k''+1)-ary [[finitary relation|relation]] that is functional on its first ''k'' domains.

The above describes what is usually called a ''finitary'' operation, referring to the finite number of arguments (the value ''k''). There are obvious extensions where the arity is taken to be an infinite [[ordinal number|ordinal]] or [[cardinal number|cardinal]], or even an arbitrary set indexing the arguments.

Often, use of the term ''operation'' implies that the domain of the function is a power of the codomain (i.e. the [[Cartesian product]] of one or more copies of the codomain),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Chapter II, Definition 1.1|first=S. N.|last=Burris|first2=H. P.|last2=Sankappanavar|title=A Course in Universal Algebra|publisher=Springer|date=1981|url=http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~snburris/htdocs/ualg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is by no means universal, as in the example of multiplying a vector by a scalar.

== Early life and education ==
Scholze was born in [[Dresden]] and grew up in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zwei Forscher der Uni Bonn erhalten den Leibniz-Preis |url=https://www.uni-bonn.de/neues/279-2015 |publisher=Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t Bonn |accessdate=1 August 2018 |language=German |date=10 December 2015 |quote=Peter Scholze wurde 1987 in Dresden geboren und wuchs auf in Berlin.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the {{Interlanguage link multi|Heinrich-Hertz-Gymnasium|de|3=Heinrich-Hertz-Gymnasium (Berlin)}} in [[Friedrichshain|Berlin-Friedrichshain]], a [[Gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasium]] devoted to  mathematics and science.&lt;ref name="tagesspiegel"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mit ihm kann man rechnen |url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/mit-ihm-kann-man-rechnen/629972.html |accessdate=1 August 2018 |work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]] |date=3 August 2005 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a student, Scholze participated in the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]], winning three gold medals and one silver medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=7867|title=International Mathematical Olympiad|last=Dolinar|first=Gregor|website=International Mathematical Olympiad|access-date=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied at the [[University of Bonn]] and completed his [[Bachelor's degree]] in three semesters and his [[Master's degree]] in two further semesters.&lt;ref name="Spiegel2012"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/24-jaehriges-mathe-genie-wird-deutschlands-juengster-professor-a-861373.html|title=Mathe-Genie: 24-J√§hriger wird Deutschlands j√ºngster Professor|date=16 October 2012|work=Spiegel Online|access-date=1 August 2018|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained his Ph.D. in 2012 under the supervision of [[Michael Rapoport]].&lt;ref name="mathgenea" /&gt;

==Career==
From July 2011 until 2016, Scholze was a Research Fellow of the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] in New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Peter Scholze |url=http://www.claymath.org/people/peter-scholze-1 |publisher=[[Clay Mathematics Institute]] |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 shortly after completing his PhD, he was made full professor at the University of Bonn, becoming the youngest full professor in Germany at the age of 24.&lt;ref name="onlinede" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiegel2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bild.de/news/inland/mathematiker/mathe-genie-peter-scholze-juengster-professor-bonn-26715142.bild.html|title=Peter Scholze ist erst 24 Jahre alt: Mathe-Genie wird Deutschlands j√ºngster Professor|date=15 October 2012|work=Bild|access-date=1 August 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/hochschule-mathematikgenie-aus-berlin,10809148,20602974.html|title=Hochschule: Mathematikgenie aus Berlin|last=Harmsen|first=Torsten|date=15 October 2012|work=Berliner Zeitung|access-date=1 August 2018|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In Fall 2014, Scholze was appointed the Chancellor's Professor at [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he taught a course on [[P-adic analysis|p-adic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://math.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/peter-scholze|title=Peter Scholze|publisher=Department of Mathematics at University of California Berkeley|language=en|access-date=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/scholze/Berkeley.pdf|title=Berkeley lectures on p-adic geometry|last1=Scholze|first1=Peter|last2=Weinstein|first2=Jared|date=October 2018|website=University of Bonn|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2018, Scholze was appointed as a director of the [[Max Planck Institute for Mathematics]] in Bonn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Peter Scholze new director at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics |url=https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/8461 |publisher=[[Max Planck Institute for Mathematics]] |accessdate=11 July 2018 |language=en |date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

Scholze's work has concentrated on purely local aspects of [[arithmetic geometry]] such as [[p-adic number|''p''-adic]] geometry and its applications. He presented in a more compact form some of the previous fundamental theories pioneered by [[Gerd Faltings]], [[Jean-Marc Fontaine]] and later by [[Kiran Kedlaya]]. His PhD thesis on [[perfectoid space]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scholze |first1=Peter |title=Perfectoid Spaces |journal=[[Publications Math√©matiques de l'IH√âS]] |date=November 2012 |volume=116 |issue=1 |pages=245‚Äì313 |doi=10.1007/s10240-012-0042-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; yields the solution to a special case of the [[weight-monodromy conjecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scholze|first=Peter|url=http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/scholze/CDM.pdf|title=Perfectoid spaces: A survey|website=University of Bonn|accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3733">The curved '''point-normal triangle''', in short '''PN triangle''', is an interpolation algorithm to retrieve a cubic [[B√©zier triangle]] from the vertex coordinates of a regular [[Triangle|flat triangle]] and [[Normal (geometry)|normal vectors]]. The PN triangle retains the [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of the flat triangle as well as the corresponding normals. It was first introduced by A. Vlachos et al. in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vlachos|first=Alex|last2=Peters|first2=J√∂rg|last3=Boyd|first3=Chas|last4=Mitchell|first4=Jason L.|date=2001-03-01|title=Curved PN triangles|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=364338.364387|publisher=ACM|pages=159‚Äì166|doi=10.1145/364338.364387|isbn=1581132921}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is primarily used in the field of [[computer graphics]]. The usage of the PN triangle enables the visualization of triangle based surfaces in a smoother shape at low cost in terms of rendering complexity and time.
== Mathematical formulation ==
With information of the given vertex positions &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathbf{P}_{1},\mathbf{P}_{2},\mathbf{P}_{3} \in \mathbb{R}^{3}
&lt;/math&gt; of a flat triangle and the according normal vectors &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathbf{N}_{1},
\mathbf{N}_{2},
\mathbf{N}_{3}
&lt;/math&gt; at the vertices a cubic B√©zier triangle is constructed. In contrast to the notation of the B√©zier triangle page the nomenclature follows G. Farin (2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Curves and surfaces for CAGD : a practical guide |last=Farin |first=Gerald E. |date=2002 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |isbn=9780080503547 |edition=5th |location=San Francisco, CA |oclc=181100270}}&lt;/ref&gt;, therefore we denote the 10 [[Control point (mathematics)|control points]] as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathbf{b}_{ijk}
&lt;/math&gt; with the positive indices holding the condition &lt;math display="inline"&gt;i+j+k = 3
&lt;/math&gt;.

The first three control points are equal to the given vertices.&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}\mathbf{b}_{300} &amp;= \mathbf{P}_{1}, &amp; \mathbf{b}_{030} &amp;= \mathbf{P}_{2}, &amp; \mathbf{b}_{003} &amp;= \mathbf{P}_{3}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;Six control points related to the triangle edges, i.e. &lt;math display="inline"&gt;i,j,k = \left\{0,1,2\right\}
&lt;/math&gt; are computed as&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{b}_{012} &amp;= \frac{1}{3} \left( 2 \mathbf{P}_{3} + \mathbf{P}_{2} - \omega_{32}\mathbf{N}_{3}\right), &amp;

In [[set theory]], a '''prewellordering''' is a [[binary relation]] &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; that is [[Transitive relation|transitive]], [[total relation|total]], and [[Well-founded relation|wellfounded]] (more precisely, the relation &lt;math&gt;x\le y\land y\nleq x&lt;/math&gt; is wellfounded).  In other words, if &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; is a prewellordering on a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and if we define &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;x\sim y\iff x\leq y \land y\leq x&lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is an [[equivalence relation]] on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; induces a [[wellordering]] on the [[Quotient set|quotient]] &lt;math&gt;X/\sim&lt;/math&gt;.  The [[order-type]] of this induced wellordering is an [[ordinal number|ordinal]], referred to as the '''length''' of the prewellordering.

A '''norm''' on a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a map from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; into the ordinals.  Every norm induces a prewellordering; if &lt;math&gt;\phi:X\to Ord&lt;/math&gt; is a norm, the associated prewellordering is given by
:&lt;math&gt;x\leq y\iff\phi(x)\leq\phi(y)&lt;/math&gt;
Conversely, every prewellordering is induced by a unique '''regular norm''' (a norm &lt;math&gt;\phi:X\to Ord&lt;/math&gt; is regular if, for any &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; and any &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;, there is &lt;math&gt;y\in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi(y)=\alpha&lt;/math&gt;).

== Prewellordering property ==
If &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[pointclass]] of subsets of some collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; of [[Polish space]]s, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; closed under [[Cartesian product]], and if &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; is a prewellordering of some subset &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; of some element &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt;-'''prewellordering''' of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; if the relations &lt;math&gt;&lt;^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\leq^*&lt;/math&gt; are elements of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt;, where for &lt;math&gt;x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt;,
# &lt;math&gt;x&lt;^*y\iff x\in P\land[y\notin P\lor\{x\leq y\land y\not\leq x\}]&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;x\leq^* y\iff x\in P\land[y\notin P\lor x\leq y]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt; is said to have the '''prewellordering property''' if every set in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt; admits a &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt;-prewellordering.

The prewellordering property is related to the stronger [[scale property]]; in practice, many pointclasses having the prewellordering property also have the scale property, which allows drawing stronger conclusions.

===Examples===
&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Pi}^1_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^1_2&lt;/math&gt; both have the prewellordering property; this is provable in [[Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory|ZFC]] alone.  Assuming sufficient [[large cardinal]]s, for every &lt;math&gt;n\in\omega&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Pi}^1_{2n+1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^1_{2n+2}&lt;/math&gt;
have the prewellordering property.

===Consequences===
====Reduction====
If &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[adequate pointclass]] with the prewellordering property, then it also has the '''reduction property''':  For any space &lt;math&gt;X\in\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; and any sets &lt;math&gt;A,B\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; both in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt;, the union &lt;math&gt;A\cup B&lt;/math&gt; may be partitioned into sets &lt;math&gt;A^*,B^*&lt;/math&gt;, both in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;A^*\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B^*\subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;.

====Separation====
If &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[adequate pointclass]] whose [[dual pointclass]] has the prewellordering property, then &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt; has the '''separation property''':  For any space &lt;math&gt;X\in\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; and any sets &lt;math&gt;A,B\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; ''disjoint'' sets both in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt;, there is a set &lt;math&gt;C\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; such that both &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and its [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] &lt;math&gt;X\setminus C&lt;/math&gt; are in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\cap C=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Pi}^1_1&lt;/math&gt; has the prewellordering property, so &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^1_1&lt;/math&gt; has the separation property.  This means that if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint [[analytic set|analytic]] subsets of some Polish space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a [[Borel set|Borel]] subset &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; includes &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and is disjoint from &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[probability theory]], the '''rectified Gaussian distribution''' is a modification of the [[Gaussian distribution]] when its negative elements are reset to 0 (analogous to an electronic [[rectifier]]). It is essentially a mixture of a [[discrete distribution]] (constant 0) and a [[continuous distribution]] (a [[truncated Gaussian distribution]] with interval &lt;math&gt;(0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;) as a result of [[censoring (statistics)|censoring]].

== Density function ==
The [[probability density function]] of a rectified Gaussian distribution, for which [[random variable]]s ''X'' having this distribution, derived from the normal distribution &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2),&lt;/math&gt; are displayed as  &lt;math&gt;X \sim \mathcal{N}^{\textrm{R}}(\mu,\sigma^2) &lt;/math&gt;,   is given by
: &lt;math&gt;
    f(x;\mu,\sigma^2) =\Phi(-\frac{\mu}{\sigma})\delta(x)+ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\; e^{ -\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}\textrm{U}(x).
&lt;/math&gt;
[[Image:Truncated Gaussian.jpg|500px|thumb|A comparison of Gaussian distribution, rectified Gaussian distribution, and truncated Gaussian distribution.]]
Here, &lt;math&gt; \Phi(x) &lt;/math&gt; is the [[cumulative distribution function]] (cdf) of the [[standard normal distribution]]:
: &lt;math&gt;
    \Phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^x e^{-t^2/2} \, dt
            \quad x\in\mathbb{R},
  &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \delta(x) &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Dirac delta function]]
: &lt;math&gt;\delta(x) = \begin{cases} +\infty, &amp; x = 0 \\ 0, &amp; x \ne 0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
and, &lt;math&gt; \textrm{U}(x) &lt;/math&gt; is the [[unit step function]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{U}(x)=\begin{cases} 0, &amp; x \leq 0, \\ 1, &amp; x &gt; 0. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

==Mean and variance==

Since the unrectified normal distribution has [[mean]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and since in transforming it to the rectified distribution some probability mass has been shifted to a higher value (from negative values to 0), the mean of the rectified distribution is greater than &lt;math&gt;\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the rectified distribution is formed by moving some of the probability mass toward the rest of the probability mass, the rectification is a [[mean-preserving contraction]] combined with a mean-changing rigid shift of the distribution, and thus the [[variance]] is decreased; therefore the variance of the rectified distribution is less than &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2.&lt;/math&gt;

== Generating values==
To generate values computationally, one can use
:&lt;math&gt; s\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2), \quad x=\textrm{max}(0,s), &lt;/math&gt;
and then
:&lt;math&gt; x\sim\mathcal{N}^{\textrm{R}}(\mu,\sigma^2).&lt;/math&gt;

== Application==
A rectified Gaussian distribution is semi-conjugate to the Gaussian likelihood, and it has been recently applied to [[factor analysis]], or particularly, (non-negative) rectified factor analysis.

In [[mathematical analysis]] and in [[probability theory]], a '''œÉ-algebra''' (also '''œÉ-field''') on a set ''X'' is a collection Œ£ of [[subset]]s of ''X'' that
includes ''X'' itself,
is [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under [[complement (set theory)|complement]], and is closed under
countable [[union (set theory)|unions]]
(the definition implies that it also includes 
the [[Empty set|empty subset]] and that it is closed under countable [[intersection (set theory)|intersections]]). 
The pair (''X'', Œ£) is called a [[measurable space]] or Borel space.

A œÉ-algebra is a type of [[algebra of sets]]. An algebra of sets needs only to be closed under the union or intersection of ''finitely'' many subsets, which is a weaker condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Probability, Mathematical Statistics, Stochastic Processes|url=http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/foundations/Measure.html|website=Random|publisher=University of Alabama in Huntsville, Department of Mathematical Sciences|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main use of œÉ-algebras is in the definition of [[measure (mathematics)|measures]]; specifically, the collection of those subsets for which a given measure is defined is necessarily a œÉ-algebra. This concept is important in [[mathematical analysis]] as the foundation for [[Lebesgue integration]], and in [[probability theory]], where it is interpreted as the collection of events which can be assigned probabilities. Also, in probability, œÉ-algebras are pivotal in the definition of [[conditional expectation]].

In [[statistics]], (sub) œÉ-algebras are needed for the formal mathematical definition of a [[sufficient statistic]],&lt;ref name=sufficiency&gt;{{cite book |last1=Billingsley |first1=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick Billingsley |title=Probability and Measure |date=2012 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1-118-12237-2 |edition=Anniversary}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly when the statistic is a function or a random process and the notion of [[Conditional probability distribution|conditional density]] is not applicable.

If {{math|''X'' {{=}} {''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d''},}} one possible œÉ-algebra on ''X'' is {{math|Œ£ {{=}} {‚Äâ‚àÖ, {''a'', ''b''}, {''c'', ''d''}, {''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d''}‚Äâ},}} where ‚àÖ is the [[empty set]]. In general, a finite algebra is always a œÉ-algebra.

If {''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ‚Ä¶} is a countable [[partition of a set|partition]] of ''X'' then the collection of all unions of sets in the partition (including the empty set) is a œÉ-algebra.

A more useful example is the set of subsets of the [[real line]] formed by starting with all [[open interval]]s and adding in all countable unions, countable intersections, and relative complements and continuing this process (by [[transfinite iteration]] through all [[countable ordinal]]s) until the relevant closure properties are achieved (a construction known as the [[Borel hierarchy]]).

==Motivation==
There are at least three key motivators for œÉ-algebras: defining measures, manipulating limits of sets, and managing partial information characterized by sets.

===Measure===
A [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] on ''X'' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that assigns a non-negative [[real number]] to subsets of ''X''; this can be thought of as making precise a notion of "size" or "volume" for sets. We want the size of the union of disjoint sets to be the sum of their individual sizes, even for an infinite sequence of [[disjoint sets]].

One would like to assign a size to ''every'' subset of ''X'', but in many natural settings, this is not possible. For example, the [[axiom of choice]] implies that when the size under consideration is the ordinary notion of length for subsets of the real line, then there exist sets for which no size exists, for example, the [[Vitali set]]s. For this reason, one considers instead a smaller collection of privileged subsets of ''X''. These subsets will be called the measurable sets. They are closed under operations that one would expect for measurable sets; that is, the complement of a measurable set is a measurable set and the countable union of measurable sets is a measurable set.  Non-empty collections of sets with these properties are called œÉ-algebras.

===Limits of sets===
Many uses of measure, such as the probability concept of [[convergence of random variables|almost sure convergence]], involve [[set-theoretic limit|limits of sequences of sets]]. For this, closure under countable unions and intersections is paramount. Set limits are defined as follows on œÉ-algebras.
* The limit supremum of a sequence ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., each of which is a subset of ''X'', is
::&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n\to\infty}A_n = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty\bigcup_{m=n}^\infty A_m.&lt;/math&gt;
* The limit infimum of a sequence ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., each of which is a subset of ''X'', is
::&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty}A_n = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty\bigcap_{m=n}^\infty A_m.&lt;/math&gt;
* If, in fact,
::&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty}A_n = \limsup_{n\to\infty}A_n,&lt;/math&gt;
:then the &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}A_n&lt;/math&gt; exists as that common set.

===Sub œÉ-algebras===
In much of probability, especially when [[conditional expectation]] is involved, one is concerned with sets that represent only part of all the possible information that can be observed. This partial information can be characterized with a smaller œÉ-algebra which is a subset of the principal œÉ-algebra; it consists of the collection of subsets relevant only to and determined only by the partial information. A simple example suffices to illustrate this idea.

Imagine you and another person are betting on a game that involves flipping a coin repeatedly and observing whether it comes up Heads (''H'') or Tails (''T''). Since you and your opponent are each infinitely wealthy, there is no limit to how long the game can last. This means the [[sample space]] Œ© must consist of all possible infinite sequences of ''H'' or ''T'':

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega = \{H, T\}^\infty = \{(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots) : x_i \in \{H, T\}, i \ge 1\}.&lt;/math&gt;

However, after ''n'' flips of the coin, you may want to determine or revise your betting strategy in advance of the next flip. The observed information at that point can be described in terms of the 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; possibilities for the first ''n'' flips. Formally, since you need to use subsets of Œ©, this is codified as the œÉ-algebra

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_n = \{A \times \{H, T\}^\infty : A \subset \{H, T\}^n\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_1 \subset \mathcal{G}_2 \subset \mathcal{G}_3 \subset \cdots \subset \mathcal{G}_\infty,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_\infty&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest œÉ-algebra containing all the others.

==Definition and properties==

===Definition===
Let ''X'' be some set, and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt; represent its [[power set]]. Then a subset &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''''œÉ''-algebra''' if it satisfies the following three properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Rudin | first=Walter | authorlink=Walter Rudin | title=Real &amp; Complex Analysis | publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] | year=1987 | isbn=0-07-054234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''X'' is in Œ£, and ''X'' is considered to be the [[universal set]] in the following context.
# Œ£ is ''closed under complementation'': If ''A'' is in Œ£, then so is its [[complement (set theory)|complement]], {{math|''X'' \ ''A''}}.
# Œ£ is ''closed under countable unions'': If ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... are in Œ£, then so is ''A'' = ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ‚à™ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ‚à™ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ‚à™ ‚Ä¶ .

From these properties, it follows that the œÉ-algebra is also closed under countable [[intersection (set theory)|intersections]] (by applying [[De Morgan's laws]]).

It also follows that the [[empty set]] ‚àÖ is in Œ£, since by '''(1)''' ''X'' is in Œ£ and '''(2)''' asserts that its complement, the empty set, is also in Œ£.  Moreover, since {{math|{''X'', ‚àÖ}}} satisfies condition '''(3)''' as well, it follows that {{math|{''X'', ‚àÖ}}} is the smallest possible œÉ-algebra on ''X''.  The largest possible œÉ-algebra on ''X'' is 2&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt;:=&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt;.

Elements of the ''œÉ''-algebra are called [[measurable set]]s. An ordered pair {{math|(''X'', Œ£)}}, where ''X'' is a set and Œ£ is a ''œÉ''-algebra over ''X'', is called a '''measurable space'''. A function between two measurable spaces is called a [[measurable function]] if the [[preimage]] of every measurable set is measurable. The collection of measurable spaces forms a [[category (mathematics)|category]], with the [[measurable function]]s as [[morphism]]s. [[Measure (mathematics)|Measures]] are defined as certain types of functions from a ''œÉ''-algebra to [0, ‚àû].

A œÉ-algebra is both a [[pi-system|œÄ-system]] and a [[Dynkin system]] (Œª-system). The converse is true as well, by Dynkin's theorem (below).

===Dynkin's œÄ-Œª theorem===
This theorem (or the related [[monotone class theorem]]) is an essential tool for proving many results about properties of specific œÉ-algebras. It capitalizes on the nature of two simpler classes of sets, namely the following.
: A [[pi-system|œÄ-system]] ''P'' is a collection of subsets of X that is closed under finitely many intersections, and
: a [[Dynkin system]] (or Œª-system) ''D'' is a collection of subsets of X that contains X and is closed under complement and under countable unions of ''disjoint'' subsets.

Dynkin's œÄ-Œª theorem says, if ''P'' is a œÄ-system and ''D'' is a Dynkin system that contains ''P'' then the œÉ-algebra œÉ(''P'') [[sigma-algebra#œÉ-algebra generated by an arbitrary family|generated]] by ''P'' is contained in ''D''.  Since certain œÄ-systems are relatively simple classes, it may not be hard to verify that all sets in ''P'' enjoy the property under consideration while, on the other hand, showing that the collection ''D'' of all subsets with the property is a Dynkin system can also be straightforward. Dynkin's œÄ-Œª Theorem then implies that all sets in œÉ(''P'') enjoy the property, avoiding the task of checking it for an arbitrary set in œÉ(''P'').

One of the most fundamental uses of the œÄ-Œª theorem is to show equivalence of separately defined measures or integrals. For example, it is used to equate a probability for a random variable ''X'' with the [[Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral]] typically associated with computing the probability:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(X\in A)=\int_A \,F(dx)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''A'' in the Borel œÉ-algebra on '''R''',

where ''F''(''x'') is the [[cumulative distribution function]] for ''X'', defined on '''R''', while &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[probability measure]], defined on a œÉ-algebra Œ£ of subsets of some [[sample space]] Œ©.

===Combining œÉ-algebras===
Suppose &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\{\Sigma_\alpha:\alpha\in\mathcal{A}\}&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of œÉ-algebras on a space ''X''.

* The intersection of a collection of œÉ-algebras is a œÉ-algebra. To emphasize its character as a œÉ-algebra, it often is denoted by:
::&lt;math&gt;\bigwedge_{\alpha\in\mathcal{A}}\Sigma_\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;
:'''Sketch of Proof:''' Let {{math|Œ£&lt;sup&gt;‚àó&lt;/sup&gt;}} denote the intersection. Since ''X'' is in every {{math|Œ£&lt;sub&gt;''Œ±''&lt;/sub&gt;, Œ£&lt;sup&gt;‚àó&lt;/sup&gt;}} is not empty. Closure under complement and countable unions for every {{math|Œ£&lt;sub&gt;''Œ±''&lt;/sub&gt;}} implies the same must be true for {{math|Œ£&lt;sup&gt;‚àó&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Therefore, {{math|Œ£&lt;sup&gt;‚àó&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a œÉ-algebra.

* The union of a collection of œÉ-algebras is not generally a œÉ-algebra, or even an algebra, but it [[sigma-algebra#œÉ-algebra generated by an arbitrary family|generates]] a œÉ-algebra known as the [[join (sigma algebra)|join]] which typically is denoted
::&lt;math&gt;\bigvee_{\alpha\in\mathcal{A}}\Sigma_\alpha=\sigma\left(\bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathcal{A}}\Sigma_\alpha\right).&lt;/math&gt;
:A œÄ-system that generates the join is
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}=\left \{\bigcap_{i=1}^nA_i:A_i\in\Sigma_{\alpha_i},\alpha_i\in\mathcal{A},\ n\ge1 \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
:'''Sketch of Proof:''' By the case ''n'' = 1, it is seen that each &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_\alpha\subset\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;, so
::&lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathcal{A}}\Sigma_\alpha\subset\mathcal{P}.&lt;/math&gt;
:This implies
::&lt;math&gt;\sigma\left(\bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathcal{A}}\Sigma_\alpha\right)\subset\sigma(\mathcal{P})&lt;/math&gt;
:by the definition of a œÉ-algebra [[sigma-algebra#œÉ-algebra generated by an arbitrary family|generated]] by a collection of subsets. On the other hand,
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}\subset\sigma\left(\bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathcal{A}}\Sigma_\alpha\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:which, by Dynkin's œÄ-Œª theorem, implies
::&lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathcal{P})\subset\sigma\left(\bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathcal{A}}\Sigma_\alpha\right).&lt;/math&gt;

===œÉ-algebras for subspaces===
Suppose ''Y'' is a subset of ''X'' and let (''X'', Œ£) be a measurable space.
* The collection {''Y'' ‚à© ''B'': ''B'' ‚àà Œ£} is a œÉ-algebra of subsets of ''Y''.
* Suppose (''Y'', Œõ) is a measurable space. The collection {''A'' ‚äÇ ''X'' : ''A'' ‚à© ''Y'' ‚àà Œõ} is a œÉ-algebra of subsets of ''X''.

===Relation to œÉ-ring===
A ''œÉ''-algebra Œ£ is just a [[Sigma-ring|''œÉ''-ring]] that contains the universal set ''X''.&lt;ref name=Vestrup2009&gt;{{cite book| last=Vestrup |first=Eric M. |title=The Theory of Measures and Integration |year=2009 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-470-31795-2 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''œÉ''-ring need not be a ''œÉ''-algebra, as for example measurable subsets of zero Lebesgue measure in the real line are a ''œÉ''-ring, but not a ''œÉ''-algebra since the real line has infinite measure and thus cannot be obtained by their countable union. If, instead of zero measure, one takes measurable subsets of finite Lebesgue measure, those are a [[Ring of sets|ring]] but not a ''œÉ''-ring, since the real line can be obtained by their countable union yet its measure is not finite.

===Typographic note===
''œÉ''-algebras are sometimes denoted using [[calligraphic]] capital letters, or the [[Fraktur (typeface)|Fraktur typeface]]. Thus {{math|(''X'', Œ£)}} may be denoted as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle(X,\,\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt; or  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle(X,\,\mathfrak{F})&lt;/math&gt;.

==Particular cases and examples==

===Separable œÉ-algebras===
A '''separable &amp;sigma;-algebra''' (or '''separable &amp;sigma;-field''') is a &amp;sigma;-algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; that is a [[separable space]] when considered as a [[metric space]] with [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] &lt;math&gt;\rho(A,B) = \mu(A \mathbin{\triangle} B)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;A,B \in \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; and a given [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; (and with &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; being the [[symmetric difference]] operator).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D≈æamonja|first1=Mirna|last2=Kunen|first2=Kenneth|authorlink2=Kenneth Kunen|title=Properties of the class of measure separable compact spaces| journal=[[Fundamenta Mathematicae]]|year=1995|pages=262|url=https://archive.uea.ac.uk/~h020/fundamenta.pdf|quote=If &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a Borel measure on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the measure algebra of &lt;math&gt;(X,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; is the Boolean algebra of all Borel sets modulo &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;-null sets. If &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is finite, then such a measure algebra is also a metric space, with the distance between the two sets being the measure of their symmetric difference. Then, we say that &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is ''separable'' [[if and only if|iff]] this metric space is separable as a topological space.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that any &amp;sigma;-algebra generated by a [[countable]] collection of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] is separable, but the converse need not hold. For example, the Lebesgue &amp;sigma;-algebra is separable (since every Lebesgue measurable set is equivalent to some Borel set) but not countably generated (since its cardinality is higher than continuum).

A separable measure space has a natural [[pseudometric space|pseudometric]] that renders it [[separable space|separable]] as a [[pseudometric space]].  The distance between two sets is defined as the measure of the [[symmetric difference]] of the two sets.  Note that the symmetric difference of two distinct sets can have measure zero; hence the pseudometric as defined above need not to be a true metric.  However, if sets whose symmetric difference has measure zero are identified into a single [[equivalence class]], the resulting [[equivalence class|quotient set]] can be properly metrized by the induced metric.  If the measure space is separable, it can be shown that the corresponding metric space is, too.

===Simple set-based examples===
Let ''X'' be any set.
* The family consisting only of the empty set and the set ''X'', called the minimal or '''trivial œÉ-algebra''' over ''X''.
* The [[power set]] of ''X'', called the '''discrete œÉ-algebra'''.
* The collection {‚àÖ, ''A'', ''A''&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;, ''X''} is a simple œÉ-algebra generated by the subset ''A''.
* The collection of subsets of ''X'' which are countable or whose complements are countable is a œÉ-algebra (which is distinct from the power set of ''X'' if and only if ''X'' is uncountable). This is the œÉ-algebra generated by the [[Singleton (mathematics)|singletons]] of ''X''. Note: "countable" includes finite or empty.
* The collection of all unions of sets in a countable [[partition of a set|partition]] of ''X'' is a œÉ-algebra.

===Stopping time sigma-algebras===
{{main article|Œ£-Algebra of œÑ-past}}
A [[stopping time]] &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; can define a &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{\tau}&lt;/math&gt;, the
so-called &lt;math&gt;\sigma &lt;/math&gt;-Algebra of œÑ-past, which in a [[Filtration (probability theory)|filtered probability space]] describes the information up to the random time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; in the sense that, if the filtered probability space is interpreted as a random experiment, the maximum information that can be found out about the experiment from arbitrarily often repeating it until the time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{\tau}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Fischer (2013)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Tom|title=On simple representations of stopping times and stopping time sigma-algebras|journal=Statistics and Probability Letters|year=2013|volume=83|issue=1|pages=345‚Äì349|doi=10.1016/j.spl.2012.09.024|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spl.2012.09.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==œÉ-algebras generated by families of sets==

===œÉ-algebra generated by an arbitrary family===
{{main article|Generated œÉ-algebra (by sets)}}
{{anchor}}
Let ''F'' be an arbitrary family of subsets of ''X''. Then there exists a unique smallest œÉ-algebra which contains every set in ''F'' (even though ''F'' may or may not itself be a œÉ-algebra). It is, in fact, the intersection of all œÉ-algebras containing ''F''. (See intersections of œÉ-algebras above.) This œÉ-algebra is denoted œÉ(''F'') and is called '''the œÉ-algebra generated by ''F'''''.

If ''F'' is empty, then œÉ(''F'')={{math|{''X'', ‚àÖ}}}.  Otherwise œÉ(''F'') consists of all the subsets of ''X'' that can be made from elements of ''F'' by a countable number of complement, union and intersection operations.

For a simple example, consider the set ''X'' = {1, 2, 3}. Then the œÉ-algebra generated by the single subset {1} is {{math|œÉ(&lt;nowiki&gt;{{1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;) {{=}} {‚àÖ, {1}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}. By an [[abuse of notation]], when a collection of subsets contains only one element, ''A'', one may write œÉ(''A'') instead of œÉ({''A''}); in the prior example œÉ({1}) instead of œÉ(&lt;nowiki&gt;{{1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;). Indeed, using {{math|œÉ(''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...)}} to mean {{math|œÉ({''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...})}} is also quite common.

There are many families of subsets that generate useful œÉ-algebras. Some of these are presented here.

===œÉ-algebra generated by a function===
If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a function from a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to a set &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra of subsets of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, then the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;'''-algebra generated by the function''' &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\sigma (f)&lt;/math&gt;, is the collection of all inverse images &lt;math&gt;f^{-1} (S)&lt;/math&gt; of the sets &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. i.e.

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma (f) = \{ f^{-1}(S) \, | \, S\in B \}. &lt;/math&gt;

A function ''f'' from a set ''X'' to a set ''Y'' is [[Measurable function|measurable]] with respect to a œÉ-algebra Œ£ of subsets of ''X'' if and only if œÉ(''f'') is a subset of Œ£.

One common situation, and understood by default if ''B'' is not specified explicitly, is when ''Y'' is a [[metric space|metric]] or [[topological space]] and ''B'' is the collection of [[Borel set]]s on ''Y''.

If ''f'' is a function from ''X'' to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; then œÉ(''f'') is generated by the family of subsets which are inverse images of intervals/rectangles in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(f)=\sigma\left(\{f^{-1}((a_1,b_1]\times\cdots\times(a_n,b_n]):a_i,b_i\in\mathbb{R}\}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

A useful property is the following. Assume ''f'' is a measurable map from (''X'', Œ£&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) to (''S'', Œ£&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;) and ''g'' is a measurable map from (''X'', Œ£&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) to (''T'', Œ£&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;). If there exists a measurable map ''h'' from (''T'', Œ£&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;) to (''S'', Œ£&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;) such that ''f''(''x'') = ''h''(''g''(''x'')) for all ''x'', then œÉ(''f'') ‚äÇ œÉ(''g''). If ''S'' is finite or countably infinite or, more generally, (''S'', Œ£&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a [[standard Borel space]] (e.g., a separable complete metric space with its associated Borel sets), then the converse is also true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Kallenberg | first=Olav | authorlink=Olav Kallenberg | title=Foundations of Modern Probability |edition=2nd | publisher=[[Springer Publishing|Springer]] | year=2001 | isbn=0-387-95313-2|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of standard Borel spaces include '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with its Borel sets and '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;‚àû&lt;/sup&gt; with the cylinder œÉ-algebra described below.

===Borel and Lebesgue œÉ-algebras===
An important example is the [[Borel algebra]] over any [[topological space]]: the œÉ-algebra generated by the [[open set]]s (or, equivalently, by the [[closed set]]s). Note that this œÉ-algebra is not, in general, the whole power set. For a non-trivial example that is not a Borel set, see the [[Vitali set]] or [[Borel set#Non-Borel sets|Non-Borel sets]].

On the [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, another œÉ-algebra is of importance: that of all [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue measurable]] sets. This œÉ-algebra contains more sets than the Borel œÉ-algebra on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and is preferred in [[Integral|integration]] theory, as it gives a [[complete measure|complete measure space]].

===Product œÉ-algebra===
Let &lt;math&gt;(X_1,\Sigma_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(X_2,\Sigma_2)&lt;/math&gt; be two measurable spaces. The œÉ-algebra for the corresponding [[product space]] &lt;math&gt;X_1\times X_2&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''product œÉ-algebra''' and is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1\times\Sigma_2=\sigma(\{B_1\times B_2:B_1\in\Sigma_1,B_2\in\Sigma_2\}).&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that &lt;math&gt;\{B_1\times B_2:B_1\in\Sigma_1,B_2\in\Sigma_2\}&lt;/math&gt; is a œÄ-system.

The Borel œÉ-algebra for '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is generated by half-infinite rectangles and by finite rectangles. For example,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n)=\sigma \left(\left \{(-\infty,b_1]\times\cdots\times(-\infty,b_n]:b_i\in\mathbb{R} \right \}\right) = \sigma\left(\left \{(a_1,b_1]\times\cdots\times(a_n,b_n]:a_i,b_i\in\mathbb{R} \right \}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

For each of these two examples, the generating family is a œÄ-system.

===œÉ-algebra generated by cylinder sets===
Suppose

:&lt;math&gt;X\subset\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{T}}=\{f:f(t)\in\mathbb{R},\ t\in\mathbb{T}\}&lt;/math&gt;

is a set of real-valued functions. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; denote the Borel subsets of '''R'''. A [[cylinder set|cylinder subset]] of {{mvar|X}} is a finitely restricted set defined as

:&lt;math&gt;C_{t_1,\dots,t_n}(B_1,\dots,B_n)=\{f\in X:f(t_i)\in B_i, 1\le i \le n\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Each

:&lt;math&gt;\{C_{t_1,\dots,t_n}(B_1,\dots,B_n):B_i\in\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}), 1\le i \le n\}&lt;/math&gt;

is a œÄ-system that generates a œÉ-algebra &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\Sigma_{t_1,\dots,t_n}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the family of subsets

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_X=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty\bigcup_{t_i\in\mathbb{T},i\le n}\Sigma_{t_1,\dots,t_n}&lt;/math&gt;

is an algebra that generates the '''cylinder œÉ-algebra''' for {{mvar|X}}. This œÉ-algebra is a subalgebra of the Borel œÉ-algebra determined by the [[product topology]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{T}}&lt;/math&gt; restricted to {{mvar|X}}.

An important special case is when &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of natural numbers and {{mvar|X}} is a set of real-valued sequences. In this case, it suffices to consider the cylinder sets

:&lt;math&gt;C_n(B_1,\dots,B_n)=(B_1\times\cdots\times B_n\times\mathbb{R}^\infty)\cap X=\{(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n,x_{n+1},\dots)\in X:x_i\in B_i,1\le i\le n\},&lt;/math&gt;

for which

:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_n=\sigma(\{C_n(B_1,\dots,B_n):B_i\in\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}), 1\le i \le n\})&lt;/math&gt;

is a non-decreasing sequence of œÉ-algebras.

===œÉ-algebra generated by random variable or vector===
Suppose &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\Sigma,\mathbb{P})&lt;/math&gt; is a [[probability space]]. If &lt;math&gt;\textstyle Y:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is measurable with respect to the Borel œÉ-algebra on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; then {{mvar|Y}} is called a '''[[random variable]]''' (''n = 1'') or '''random vector''' (''n'' &gt; 1). The œÉ-algebra generated by {{mvar|Y}} is

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma (Y) = \{ Y^{-1}(A): A\in\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n) \}.&lt;/math&gt;

===œÉ-algebra generated by a stochastic process===
Suppose &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\Sigma,\mathbb{P})&lt;/math&gt; is a [[probability space]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of real-valued functions on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\textstyle Y:\Omega\to X\subset\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; is measurable with respect to the cylinder œÉ-algebra &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathcal{F}_X)&lt;/math&gt; (see above) for {{mvar|X}} then {{mvar|Y}} is called a '''[[stochastic process]]''' or '''random process'''. The œÉ-algebra generated by {{mvar|Y}} is

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(Y) = \left \{ Y^{-1}(A): A\in\sigma(\mathcal{F}_X) \right \}= \sigma(\{ Y^{-1}(A): A\in\mathcal{F}_X\}),&lt;/math&gt;

the œÉ-algebra generated by the inverse images of cylinder sets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9168">In mathematics, a '''Stanley‚ÄìReisner ring''' is a quotient of a [[polynomial ring|polynomial algebra]] over a [[field (algebra)|field]] by a square-free [[monomial ideal|monomial]]  [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]. Such ideals are described more geometrically in terms of finite [[simplicial complex]]es. The Stanley‚ÄìReisner ring construction is a basic tool within [[algebraic combinatorics]] and [[combinatorial commutative algebra]].&lt;ref name=MS19&gt;Miller &amp; Sturmfels (2005) p.19&lt;/ref&gt;  Its properties were investigated by [[Richard P. Stanley|Richard Stanley]], [[Melvin Hochster]], and Gerald Reisner in the early 1970s.

== Definition and properties ==

Given an [[abstract simplicial complex]] Œî on the vertex set {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} and a field '''k''', the corresponding '''Stanley‚ÄìReisner ring''', or '''face ring''', denoted '''k'''[Œî], is obtained from the polynomial ring '''k'''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] by quotienting out the ideal ''I''&lt;sub&gt;Œî&lt;/sub&gt; generated by the square-free monomials corresponding to the non-faces of&amp;nbsp;Œî:

: &lt;math&gt; I_\Delta=(x_{i_1}\ldots x_{i_r}: \{i_1,\ldots,i_r\}\notin\Delta), \quad k[\Delta]=k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I_\Delta. &lt;/math&gt;

The ideal ''I''&lt;sub&gt;Œî&lt;/sub&gt; is called the '''Stanley‚ÄìReisner ideal''' or the '''face ideal''' of&amp;nbsp;Œî.&lt;ref name=MS35&gt;Miller &amp; Sturmfels (2005) pp.3‚Äì5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Properties ===

* The Stanley‚ÄìReisner ring '''k'''[Œî] is multigraded by '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, where the degree of the variable ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''i''th standard basis vector ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of&amp;nbsp;'''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.
* As a vector space over '''k''', the Stanley‚ÄìReisner ring of Œî admits a direct sum decomposition

:: &lt;math&gt; k[\Delta] = \bigoplus_{\sigma\in\Delta}k[\Delta]_\sigma,&lt;/math&gt;

: whose summands '''k'''[Œî]&lt;sub&gt;''œÉ''&lt;/sub&gt; have a basis of the monomials (not necessarily square-free) supported on the faces ''œÉ'' of&amp;nbsp;Œî.

* The [[Krull dimension]] of '''k'''[Œî] is one larger than the dimension of the simplicial complex&amp;nbsp;Œî.
* The multigraded, or ''fine'', [[Hilbert series]] of '''k'''[Œî] is given by the formula

:: &lt;math&gt; H(k[\Delta]; x_1,\ldots,x_n) = 
\sum_{\sigma\in\Delta}\prod_{i\in\sigma}\frac{x_i}{1-x_i}. &lt;/math&gt;

* The ordinary, or ''coarse'', Hilbert series of '''k'''[Œî] is obtained from its multigraded Hilbert series by setting the degree of every variable ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; equal to&amp;nbsp;1:

:: &lt;math&gt; H(k[\Delta]; t,\ldots,t) = 
\frac{1}{(1-t)^n}\sum_{i=0}^d f_{i-1} t^i(1-t)^{n-i}, &lt;/math&gt;

: where ''d'' = dim(Œî)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is the Krull dimension of '''k'''[Œî] and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of ''i''-faces of Œî. If it is written in the form

:: &lt;math&gt; H(k[\Delta]; t,\ldots,t) = 
\frac{h_0 + h_1 t + \cdots + h_d t^d}{(1-t)^d} &lt;/math&gt;

:then the coefficients (''h''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;) of the numerator form the ''h''-vector of the simplicial complex&amp;nbsp;Œî.

== Examples ==

It is common to assume that every vertex {''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;} is a simplex in Œî. Thus none of the variables belongs to the Stanley‚ÄìReisner ideal&amp;nbsp;''I''&lt;sub&gt;Œî&lt;/sub&gt;.

* Œî is a [[simplex]] {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}. Then ''I''&lt;sub&gt;Œî&lt;/sub&gt; is the zero ideal and

:: &lt;math&gt; k[\Delta]=k[x_1,\ldots,x_n] &lt;/math&gt;

:is the polynomial algebra in ''n'' variables over&amp;nbsp;'''k'''.

* The simplicial complex Œî consists of ''n'' isolated vertices {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}, ..., {''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}. Then

:: &lt;math&gt;I_\Delta=\{x_i x_j: 1\leq i &lt; j \leq n\} &lt;/math&gt;

:and the Stanley‚ÄìReisner ring is the following truncation of the polynomial ring in ''n'' variables over '''k''': 
 
:: &lt;math&gt; k[\Delta] = k\oplus\bigoplus_{1\leq i\leq n} x_i k[x_i]. &lt;/math&gt;

* Generalizing the previous two examples, let Œî be the ''d''-skeleton of the simplex {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}, thus it consists of all (''d''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-element subsets of {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}. Then the Stanley‚ÄìReisner ring is following truncation of the polynomial ring in ''n'' variables over '''k''':

:: &lt;math&gt; k[\Delta] = 
k\oplus\bigoplus_{0\leq r\leq d}
\bigoplus_{i_0&lt;\ldots&lt;i_r}x_{i_0}\ldots x_{i_r} k[x_{i_0},\ldots,x_{i_r}]. &lt;/math&gt;

* Suppose that the abstract simplicial complex Œî is a simplicial join of abstract simplicial complexes Œî&lt;sup&gt;&amp;prime;&lt;/sup&gt; on ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and Œî&lt;sup&gt;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&lt;/sup&gt;  on ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''+1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Then the Stanley‚ÄìReisner ring of Œî is the [[tensor product]] over '''k''' of the Stanley‚ÄìReisner rings of Œî&lt;sup&gt;&amp;prime;&lt;/sup&gt; and&amp;nbsp;Œî&lt;sup&gt;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&lt;/sup&gt;:

:: &lt;math&gt; k[\Delta]\simeq k[\Delta']\otimes_k k[\Delta'']. &lt;/math&gt;

== Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay condition and the upper bound conjecture ==

The face ring '''k'''[Œî] is a multigraded algebra over '''k''' all of whose components with respect to the fine grading have dimension at most 1. Consequently, its homology can be studied by combinatorial and geometric methods. An abstract simplicial complex Œî is called '''Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay''' over '''k''' if its face ring is a [[Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay ring]].&lt;ref name=MS101&gt;Miller &amp; Sturmfels (2005) p.101&lt;/ref&gt;  In his 1974 thesis, Gerald Reisner gave a complete characterization of such complexes. This was soon followed up by more precise homological results about face rings due to Melvin Hochster. Then Richard Stanley found a way to prove the [[Upper Bound Conjecture]] for [[simplicial sphere]]s, which was open at the time, using the face ring construction and Reisner's criterion of Cohen‚ÄìMacaulayness. Stanley's idea of translating difficult conjectures in [[algebraic combinatorics]] into statements from [[commutative algebra]] and proving them by means of [[homological algebra|homological]] techniques was the origin of the rapidly developing field of [[combinatorial commutative algebra]].

=== Reisner's criterion ===

A simplicial complex Œî is Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay over '''k''' if and only if for all simplices ''œÉ'' ‚àà Œî, all reduced [[simplicial homology]] groups of the link of ''œÉ'' in Œî with coefficients in '''k''' are zero, except the top dimensional one:&lt;ref name=MS101/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \tilde{H}_{i}(\operatorname{link}_\Delta(\sigma); k)=0\quad \text{for all} \quad
i&lt;\dim \operatorname{link}_\Delta(\sigma). &lt;/math&gt;

A result due to Munkres then shows that the Cohen‚ÄìMacaulayness of Œî over '''k''' is a topological property: it depends only on the [[homeomorphism]] class of the simplicial complex Œî. Namely, let |Œî| be the [[geometric realization]] of Œî. Then the vanishing of the simplicial homology groups in Reisner's criterion is equivalent to the following statement about the reduced and relative [[singular homology]] groups of |Œî|:

: &lt;math&gt; \text{For all } p\in|\Delta|\text{ and for all }
i&lt;\dim |\Delta| = d-1, \quad 
\tilde{H}_i(\operatorname |\Delta|; k) = 
H_i(\operatorname |\Delta|, \operatorname |\Delta| - p; k) = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

In particular, if the complex Œî is a [[simplicial sphere]], that is, |Œî| is homeomorphic to a [[n-sphere|sphere]], then it is Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay over any field. This is a key step in Stanley's proof of the Upper Bound Conjecture. By contrast, there are examples of simplicial complexes whose Cohen&amp;ndash;Macaulayness depends on the characteristic of the field&amp;nbsp;'''k'''.

'''Stefan Bergman''' (5 May 1895 ‚Äì 6 June 1977) was a [[Poland|Polish]]-born American [[mathematician]] whose primary work was in [[complex analysis]]. His name is also written '''Bergmann'''; he dropped the second "n" when he came to the U. S. He is best known for the [[positive-definite kernel|kernel function]] he discovered while at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin University]] in 1922. This function is known today as the [[Bergman kernel]]. Bergman taught for many years at [[Stanford University]], and served as an advisor to several students.&lt;ref name="Gen"&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=13649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Czƒôstochowa]], [[Congress Poland]], [[Russian Empire]], Bergman received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at Berlin University in 1921 for a [[thesis|dissertation]] on [[Fourier analysis]]. His advisor, [[Richard von Mises]], had a strong influence on him, lasting for the rest of his career.&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Bergman}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, Bergman was forced to leave his post at the Berlin University because he was a [[Jews|Jew]]. He fled first to [[Russia]], where he stayed until 1939, and then to [[Paris]].

In [[computer programming]], a '''trait''' is a concept used in [[object-oriented programming]], which represents a set of [[Method (computer programming)|methods]] that can be used to extend the functionality of a [[Class (computer science)|class]].&lt;ref name="schaerli-ecoop-2003"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Nathanael | last1=Sch√§rli | first2=St√©phane | last2=Ducasse | first3=Oscar | last3=Nierstrasz | author-link3=Oscar Nierstrasz | first4=Andrew P. | last4=Black | url=http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/papers/Scha03aTraits.pdf | title=Traits: Composable Units of Behaviour | journal=Proceedings of the European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming (ECOOP). | series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science | volume=2743 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | year=2003 | pages=248‚Äì274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=St√©phane | last1=Ducasse | first2=Oscar | last2=Nierstrasz | first3=Nathanael | last3=Sch√§rli | first4=Roel | last4=Wuyts | first5=Andrew P. | last5=Black | url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1119479.1119483 | title=Traits: A mechanism for fine-grained reuse. | journal= ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems | volume=28 | issue=2 | pages=331‚Äì388 | date=March 2006 | doi=10.1145/1119479.1119483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Traits both provide a set of methods that implement behaviour to a class, and require that the class implement a set of methods that [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameterize]] the provided behaviour.

For inter-object communication, traits are somewhat between an object-oriented [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|protocol (interface)]] and a [[mixin]]. An interface may define one or more behaviors via [[Function prototype|method signatures]], while a trait defines behaviors via full method definitions: i.e., it includes the [[Class implementation file|body of the methods]]. In contrast, mixins include full method definitions and may also carry [[State (computer science)|state]] through member variable, while traits usually don't.

Hence an object defined as a trait is created as the composition of methods, which can be used by other classes without requiring [[multiple inheritance]]. In case of a [[naming collision]], when more than one trait to be used by a class has a method with the same name, the programmer must explicitly disambiguate which one of those methods will be used in the class; thus manually solving the ''[[Multiple inheritance#The diamond problem|diamond problem]]'' of multiple inheritance. This is different from other composition methods in object-oriented programming, where conflicting names are automatically resolved by [[Scope (computer science)|scoping rules]].

Whereas mixins can be composed only using the [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]] operation, traits offer a much wider selection of operations, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* ''symmetric sum'': an operation that merges two disjoint traits to create a new trait
* ''override'' (or ''asymmetric sum''): an operation that forms a new trait by adding methods to an existing trait, possibly overriding some of its methods
* ''alias'': an operation that creates a new trait by adding a new name for an existing method
* ''exclusion'': an operation that forms a new trait by removing a method from an existing trait. (Combining this with the alias operation yields a ''shallow rename'' operation).

Traits are composed in the following ways:
* Trait composition is commutative; the ordering of adding traits does not matter. For example, given trait ''S'' = ''A'' + ''B'', then trait ''T'' = ''B'' + ''A'' is the same as ''S''.
* Conflicting methods are excluded from the composition.
* Nested traits are equivalent to flattened traits; the composition hierarchy does not affect the traits behaviour. For example, given trait ''S'' = ''A'' + ''X'', where ''X'' = ''B'' + ''C'', then trait ''T'' = ''A'' + ''B'' + ''C'' is the same as ''S''.&lt;ref name="schaerli-ecoop-2003"/&gt;

== Examples ==

=== PHP ===
This example uses a trait to enhance other classes:
&lt;source lang="php"&gt;
// The template
trait TSingleton
{
    private static $_instance = null;

    private function __construct(){} // Must have private default constructor and be aware not to open it in the class

    public static function getInstance()
    {
        if (null === self::$_instance)
        {
            self::$_instance = new self();
        }

        return self::$_instance;
    }
}

class FrontController
{
    use TSingleton;
}

// Can also be used in already extended classes
class WebSite extends SomeClass
{
    use TSingleton;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This allows simulating aspects of multiple inheritance:
&lt;source lang="php"&gt;
trait TBounding
{
    public $x, $y, $width, $height;
}

trait TMoveable
{
    public function moveTo($x, $y)
    {
        // ‚Ä¶
    }
}

trait TResizeable
{
    public function resize($newWidth, $newHeight)
    {
        // ‚Ä¶
    }
}

class Rectangle
{
    use TBounding, TMoveable, TResizeable;

    public function fillColor($color)
    {
        // ‚Ä¶
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Rust ===
A trait in Rust declares a set of methods that a type must implement&lt;ref&gt;http://gradebot.org/doc/ipur/trait.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Rust compilers require traits to be explicated, which ensures the safety of [[Generic programming|generics]] in Rust. It also helps to avoid major problems of [[Template (C++)|template in C++]]. 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="rust"&gt;
// type T must have the "Ord" trait
// so that "&gt;" and "&lt;" operations can be done
fn get_max&lt;T: Ord&gt;(a: &amp;[T]) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;T&gt; {
	let mut result = a.get(0)?;
	for n in a {
		if *n &gt; *result {
			result = &amp;n;
		}
	}
	Some(result)
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

To simplify tedious and repeated implementation of traits like &lt;code&gt;Debug&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Ord&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;derive&lt;/code&gt; can be used to request compilers to generate certain codes automatically&lt;ref&gt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/traits.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Derivable traits include: &lt;code&gt;Clone&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Copy&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Debug&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Default&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PartialEq&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PartialOrd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Ord&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Hash&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3579">In the [[mathematical]] subfields of [[numerical analysis]] and [[mathematical analysis]], a '''trigonometric polynomial''' is a finite [[linear combination]] of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] sin(''nx'') and cos(''nx'') with ''n'' taking on the values of one or more [[natural number]]s. The coefficients may be taken as real numbers, for real-valued functions. For [[complex number|complex coefficients]], there is no difference between such a function and a finite [[Fourier series]].

Trigonometric polynomials are widely used, for example in [[trigonometric interpolation]] applied to the  [[interpolation]] of [[periodic function]]s. They are used also in the [[discrete Fourier transform]].

The term ''trigonometric polynomial'' for the real-valued case can be seen as using the [[analogy]]: the functions sin(''nx'') and cos(''nx'') are similar to the [[monomial basis]] for [[polynomial]]s. In the complex case the trigonometric polynomials are spanned by the positive and negative powers of ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''ix''&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Formal definition==
Any function ''T'' of the form

:&lt;math&gt;T(x) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^N a_n \cos (nx) + i\sum_{n=1}^N b_n \sin(nx) \qquad (x \in \mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;a_n, b_n \in \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;0 \leq n \leq N&lt;/math&gt;, is called a '''complex trigonometric polynomial''' of degree ''N'' {{harv|Rudin|1987|p=88}}. Using [[Euler's formula]] the polynomial can be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;T(x) = \sum_{n=-N}^N c_n e^{inx} \qquad (x \in \mathbb{R}).&lt;/math&gt;

Analogously, letting &lt;math&gt;a_n,  b_n \in \mathbb{R}, \quad 0 \leq n \leq N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_N \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b_N \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;t(x) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^N a_n \cos (nx) + \sum_{n=1}^N b_n \sin(nx) \qquad (x \in \mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;

is called a '''real trigonometric polynomial''' of degree ''N'' {{harv|Powell|1981|p=150}}.

==Properties==

A trigonometric polynomial can be considered a [[periodic function]] on the [[real line]], with [[Periodic function|period]] some multiple of 2{{pi}}, or as a function on the [[unit circle]].

A basic result is that the trigonometric polynomials are [[dense set|dense]] in the space of [[continuous function]]s on the unit circle, with the [[uniform norm]] {{harv|Rudin|1987|loc=Thm 4.25}}; this is a special case of the [[Stone‚ÄìWeierstrass theorem]]. More concretely, for every continuous function &amp;fnof; and every &amp;epsilon; &gt; 0, there exists a trigonometric polynomial ''T'' such that |&amp;fnof;(''z'') &amp;minus; T(''z'')| &lt; ''&amp;epsilon;'' for all ''z''. [[Fej√©r's theorem]] states that the arithmetic means of the partial sums of the [[Fourier series]] of &amp;fnof; converge uniformly to &amp;fnof;, provided &amp;fnof; is continuous on the circle, thus giving an explicit way to find an approximating trigonometric polynomial ''T''.

A trigonometric polynomial of degree ''N'' has a maximum of 2''N'' roots in any open interval &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''a'', ''a'' + 2{{pi}}&lt;nowiki&gt;)&lt;/nowiki&gt; with a in '''R''', unless it is the zero function {{harv|Powell|1981|p=150}}.

The [[Ordered weighted averaging aggregation operator|Yager's OWA (ordered weighted averaging) operators]]{{R|yagerOWA}} are used to aggregate the crisp values in decision making schemes (such as multi-criteria decision making, multi-expert decision making and  multi-criteria/multi-expert decision making).{{R|Yager|YagerBeliakov}} It is widely accepted that [[Fuzzy set]]s{{R|Zadeh}} are more suitable for representing preferences of criteria in decision making.

The type-1 OWA operators{{R|fssT1OWA|kdeT1OWA}} have been proposed for this purpose. The type-1 OWA operators provides a technique for directly aggregating uncertain information with uncertain weights via OWA mechanism in soft decision making and [[data mining]], where these uncertain objects are modelled by fuzzy sets.

The two definitions for type-1 OWA operators are based on Zadeh's Extension Principle and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-cuts of fuzzy sets. The two definitions lead to equivalent results.

==Definitions==

===Definition 1===
Let &lt;math&gt;F(X)&lt;/math&gt; be the set of fuzzy sets with domain of discourse &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, a type-1 OWA operator is defined as follows:{{R|kdeT1OWA}}

Given n linguistic weights &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {W^i} \right\}_{i = 1}^n &lt;/math&gt; in the form of fuzzy sets defined on the domain of discourse &lt;math&gt;U = [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, a type-1 OWA operator is a mapping, &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi \colon F(X)\times \cdots \times F(X)  \longrightarrow  F(X)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A^1 , \cdots ,A^n)  \mapsto   Y&lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;\mu _{Y} (y) =\displaystyle \sup_{\displaystyle \sum_{k =1}^n \bar {w}_i a_{\sigma (i)}  = y }\left({\begin{array}{*{1}l}\mu _{W^1 } (w_1 )\wedge \cdots \wedge \mu_{W^n } (w_n )\wedge \mu _{A^1 } (a_1 )\wedge \cdots \wedge \mu _{A^n } (a_n )\end{array}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar {w}_i = \frac{w_i }{\sum_{i = 1}^n {w_i } }&lt;/math&gt;,and &lt;math&gt;\sigma \colon \{1, \cdots ,n\} \longrightarrow \{1, \cdots ,n\}&lt;/math&gt; is a permutation function such that &lt;math&gt;a_{\sigma (i)} \geq a_{\sigma (i + 1)},\ \forall i = 1, \cdots ,n - 1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;a_{\sigma(i)} &lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th highest element in the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {a_1 , \cdots ,a_n } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Definition 2===
Using the alpha-cuts of fuzzy sets:{{R|kdeT1OWA}}

Given the n linguistic weights &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {W^i} \right\}_{i =1}^n &lt;/math&gt; in the form of fuzzy sets defined on the domain of discourse &lt;math&gt;U = [0,\;\;1]&lt;/math&gt;, then for each &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in [0,\;1]&lt;/math&gt;, an &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;-level type-1 OWA operator with &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;-level sets &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {W_\alpha ^i } \right\}_{i = 1}^n &lt;/math&gt; to aggregate the &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;-cuts of fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {A^i} \right\}_{i =1}^n &lt;/math&gt; is:

: &lt;math&gt;
\Phi_\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \ldots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right) =\left\{ {\frac{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\sigma (i)} } }{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i } }\left| {w_i \in W_\alpha ^i ,\;a_i } \right. \in A_\alpha ^i ,\;i = 1, \ldots ,n} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;W_\alpha ^i= \{w| \mu_{W_i }(w) \geq \alpha \}, A_\alpha ^i=\{ x| \mu _{A_i }(x)\geq \alpha \}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma :\{\;1, \cdots ,n\;\} \to \{\;1, \cdots ,n\;\}&lt;/math&gt; is a permutation function such that &lt;math&gt;a_{\sigma (i)} \ge a_{\sigma (i + 1)} ,\;\forall \;i = 1, \cdots ,n - 1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;a_{\sigma (i)} &lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th largest
element in the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {a_1 , \cdots ,a_n } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Representation theorem of Type-1 OWA operators==

Given the ''n'' linguistic weights &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {W^i} \right\}_{i =1}^n &lt;/math&gt; in the form of fuzzy sets defined on the domain of discourse &lt;math&gt;U = [0,\;\;1]&lt;/math&gt;, and the fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A^1, \cdots ,A^n&lt;/math&gt;, then we have that{{R|kdeT1OWA}}
:&lt;math&gt;Y=G&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the aggregation result obtained by Definition 1, and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the result obtained by in Definition 2.

==Programming problems for Type-1 OWA operators==

According to the Representation Theorem of Type-1 OWA Operators, a general type-1 OWA operator can be decomposed into a series of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-level type-1 OWA operators. In practice, this series of  &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-level type-1 OWA operators is used to construct the resulting aggregation fuzzy set. So we only need to compute the left end-points and right end-points of the intervals &lt;math&gt;\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the resulting aggregation fuzzy set is constructed with the membership function as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu _{G} (x) = \operatorname{ \bigvee} \limits_{\alpha :x \in \Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots
,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_\alpha } \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

For the left end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:
:&lt;math&gt; \Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_{-} = \operatorname {\min }\limits_{\begin{array}{l} W_{\alpha - }^i \le w_i \le W_{\alpha + }^i A_{\alpha - }^i \le a_i \le A_{\alpha + }^i  \end{array}} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\sigma (i)} / \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i } } &lt;/math&gt;

while for the right end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots , A_\alpha ^n } \right)_{+} = \operatorname {\max }\limits_{\begin{array}{l} W_{\alpha - }^i \le w_i \le W_{\alpha + }^i  A_{\alpha - }^i \le a_i \le A_{\alpha + }^i  \end{array}} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\sigma (i)} / \sum\limits_{i =
1}^n {w_i } } &lt;/math&gt;

A fast method has been presented to solve two programming problem so that the type-1 OWA aggregation operation can be performed efficiently, for details, please see the paper.{{R|kdeT1OWA}}

==Alpha-level approach to Type-1 OWA operation==

Three-step process:{{R|kdeT1OWA}}
* Step 1&amp;mdash;To set up the &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;- level resolution in [0, 1].
* Step 2&amp;mdash;For each &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;,
:*Step 2.1&amp;mdash;To calculate &lt;math&gt;\rho _{\alpha +} ^{i_0^\ast } &lt;/math&gt;
# Let &lt;math&gt;i_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;;
# If &lt;math&gt;\rho _{\alpha +} ^{i_0 } \ge A_{\alpha + }^{\sigma (i_0 )} &lt;/math&gt;, stop, &lt;math&gt;\rho _{\alpha +} ^{i_0 } &lt;/math&gt; is the solution; otherwise go to Step 2.1-3.
# &lt;math&gt;i_0 \leftarrow i_0 + 1&lt;/math&gt;, go to Step 2.1-2.

:*Step 2.2 To calculate&lt;math&gt;\rho _{\alpha -} ^{i_0^\ast } &lt;/math&gt;
# Let &lt;math&gt;i_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;;
# If &lt;math&gt;\rho _{\alpha -} ^{i_0 } \ge A_{\alpha - }^{\sigma (i_0 )} &lt;/math&gt;, stop, &lt;math&gt;\rho _{\alpha -} ^{i_0 } &lt;/math&gt; is the solution; otherwise go to Step 2.2-3.
#&lt;math&gt;i_0 \leftarrow i_0 + 1&lt;/math&gt;, go to step Step 2.2-2.

* Step 3&amp;mdash;To construct the aggregation resulting fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; based on all the available intervals &lt;math&gt;\left[ {\rho _{\alpha -} ^{i_0^\ast } ,\;\rho _{\alpha +} ^{i_0^\ast } } \right]&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu _{G} (x) = \operatorname \bigvee \limits_{\alpha :x \in \left[ {\rho _{\alpha -} ^{i_0^\ast } ,\;\rho _{\alpha +} ^{i_0^\ast } } \right]} \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

==Special cases==
* Any OWA operators, like maximum, minimum, mean operators;&lt;ref name="yagerOWA" /&gt;
* Join operators of (type-1) fuzzy sets,{{R|MT}} i.e., fuzzy maximum operators;
* Meet operators of (type-1) fuzzy sets,{{R|MT|zadehJ}} i.e., fuzzy minimum operators;
* Join-like operators of (type-1) fuzzy sets;{{R|kdeT1OWA|bookT1OWA}}
* Meet-like operators of (type-1) fuzzy sets.{{R|kdeT1OWA|bookT1OWA}}

==Generalizations==
Type-2 OWA operators{{R|Zhou}} have been suggested to aggregate the [[Type-2 fuzzy sets and systems|type-2 fuzzy sets]] for soft decision making.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20906">In mathematics, a '''uniformly bounded representation'''  &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of a [[locally compact group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on a [[Hilbert space]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a homomorphism into the bounded invertible operators which is continuous for the [[strong operator topology]], and such that &lt;math&gt;\sup_{g\in G} \|T_g\|_{B(H)}&lt;/math&gt; is finite. In 1947 [[B√©la Sz≈ëkefalvi-Nagy]] established that any uniformly bounded representation of the integers or the real numbers is '''unitarizable''', i.e. conjugate by an invertible operator to a [[unitary representation]]. For the integers this gives a criterion for an invertible operator to be similar to a unitary operator: the [[operator norm]]s of all the positive and negative powers must be uniformly bounded. The result on unitarizability of uniformly bounded representations was extended in 1950 by [[Jacques Dixmier|Dixmier]], Day and Nakamura-Takeda to all locally compact [[amenable group]]s, following essentially the method of proof of Sz-Nagy. The result is known to fail for non-amenable groups such as  SL(2,'''R''') and the free group on two generators. {{harvtxt|Dixmier|1950}} conjectured that a locally compact group is amenable if and only if every uniformly bounded representation is unitarizable.

==Statement==
Let ''G'' be a locally compact [[amenable group]] and let ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; be a homomorphism of ''G'' into ''GL''(''H''), the group of an invertible operators on a Hilbert space such that

*for every ''x'' in ''H'' the vector-valued ''gx'' on ''G'' is continuous;
*the operator norms of the operators ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; are uniformly bounded.

Then there is a positive invertible operator ''S'' on ''H'' such that ''S'' ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; ''S''&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt; is unitary for every ''g'' in ''G''.

As a consequence, if ''T'' is an invertible operator with all its positive and negative powers uniformly bounded in operator norm, then ''T'' is conjugate by a positive invertible operator to a unitary.

==Proof==
By assumption the continuous functions

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{f_{x,y}(g)=(T_g^{-1}x,T_g^{-1}y),}&lt;/math&gt;

generate a separable unital C* subalgebra ''A'' of the uniformly bounded continuous functions on ''G''. By construction the algebra is invariant under left translation. By amenability there is an invariant state œÜ on ''A''. It follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(x,y)_0 =\varphi(f_{x,y})}&lt;/math&gt;

is a new inner product on ''H'' satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{M^{-1}\|x\| \le \|x\|_0 \le M\|x\|}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{M=\sup_g \|T_g\| &lt; \infty.}&lt;/math&gt;

So there is a positive invertible operator ''P'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(x,y)_0 =(Px,y).}&lt;/math&gt;

By construction

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(T_gx,T_gy)_0=(x,y)_0.}&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''S'' be the unique positive square root of ''P''. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(ST_g x,ST_gy)=(PT_gx,T_gy)=(Px,y) =(Sx,Sy).}&lt;/math&gt;

Applying ''S''&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt; to ''x'' and ''y'', it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(ST_gS^{-1} x, ST_gS^{-1} y)=(x,y).}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the operators

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{U_g=ST_gS^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;
 
are invertible, it follows that they are unitary.

==Examples of non-unitarizable representations==

===SL(2,R)===
The [[complementary series representation|complentary series]] of irreducible unitary representations of SL(2,R) was introduced by {{harvtxt|Bargmann|1947}}. These representations can be realized on functions on the circle or on the real line: the Cayley transform provides the unitary equivalence between the two realizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sugiura|1980|391-393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact for 0 &lt; œÉ &lt; 1/2 and ''f'', ''g'' continuous functions on the circle define

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(f,g)_\sigma={1\over 4\pi^2} \int_{-\pi}^\pi\int_{-\pi}^\pi f(s)\overline{g(t)} k_\sigma(s-t) \,ds\, dt,}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{k_\sigma(s)=(1-\cos s)^{\sigma-1/2}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the function ''k''&lt;sub&gt;œÉ&lt;/sub&gt; is integrable, this integral converges. In fact

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(f,g)_\sigma \le \|f\|\cdot \|g\|,}&lt;/math&gt;

where the norms are the usual L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; norms.

The functions

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{f_m(t)=e^{imt}}&lt;/math&gt;

are orthogonal with

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(f_m,f_m)_\sigma=\prod_{i=1}^{|m|} {i-1/2-\sigma\over i-1/2+\sigma}= {\Gamma(1/2 +\sigma)\Gamma(|m|+1/2-\sigma)\over \Gamma(1/2-\sigma)\Gamma(m+1/2+\sigma)}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Since these quantities are positive, (''f'',''g'')&lt;sub&gt;œÉ&lt;/sub&gt; defines an inner product. The Hilbert space completion is denoted by ''H''&lt;sub&gt;œÉ&lt;/sub&gt;.

For ''F'', ''G'' continuous functions of compact support on '''R''', define

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(F,G)_\sigma^\prime=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\int_{-\infty}^\infty F(x)\overline{G(y)} |x-y|^{2\sigma-1}\,dx\, dy.}&lt;/math&gt;

Since, regarded as distributions, the Fourier transform of |''x''|&lt;sup&gt;2œÉ ‚Äì 1&lt;/sup&gt; is C&lt;sub&gt;œÉ&lt;/sub&gt;|''t''|&lt;sup&gt;‚àí2œÉ&lt;/sup&gt; for some positive constant C&lt;sub&gt;œÉ&lt;/sub&gt;, the above expression can be rewritten:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(F,G)_\sigma^\prime=C_\sigma\int_{-\infty}^\infty \widehat{F}(t)\overline{\widehat{G}(t)} |t|^{-2\sigma}\, dt.}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence it is an inner product. Let ''H'''&lt;sub&gt;œÉ&lt;/sub&gt; denote its Hilbert space completion.
 
The Cayley transform gives rise to an operator ''U'':

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{Uf(x)=2^{\sigma/2 - 3/4} \pi^{-1} |x+i|^{1-2\sigma} f\left({x-i\over x+i}\right).}&lt;/math&gt;

''U'' extends to an isometry of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;œÉ&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''H'' '&lt;sub&gt;œÉ&lt;/sub&gt;. Its adjoint is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{U^*F(e^{it})=2^{3/4-\sigma/2} \pi |1- e^{it}|^{1-2\sigma} F\left({1+e^{it}\over 1-e^{it}}\right).}&lt;/math&gt;

The Cayley transform exchanges the actions by [[M√∂bius transformation]]s of SU(1,1) on '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and of SL(2, '''R''') on '''R'''.

The operator ''U'' interwtines corresponding actions of SU(1,1) on ''H''&lt;sub&gt;œÉ&lt;/sub&gt; and SL(2,'''R''') on ''H'' '&lt;sub&gt;œÉ&lt;/sub&gt;.

For ''g'' in SU(1,1) given by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{g=\begin{pmatrix} \alpha &amp; \beta \\ \overline{\beta} &amp; \overline{\alpha}\end{pmatrix},}&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{|\alpha|^2 - |\beta|^2=1,}&lt;/math&gt;

and ''f'' continuous, set

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\pi_\sigma(g^{-1}) f(z)=|\overline{\beta}z+\overline{\alpha}|^{1-2\sigma}f\left({\alpha z +\beta\over\overline{\beta}z +\overline{\alpha}}\right).}&lt;/math&gt;

For ''g''' in SL(2,'''R''') given by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{g^\prime=\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{pmatrix},}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''ad'' ‚Äì ''bc'' = 1, set

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\pi^\prime_\sigma((g^\prime)^{-1}) F(x) =|cx+d|^{1-2\sigma} F\left({ax+b\over cx +d}\right).}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''g'' ' corresponds to ''g'' under the Cayley transform then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{U\pi_\sigma(g)U^* =\pi^\prime_\sigma(g^\prime).}&lt;/math&gt;

Polar decomposition shows that SL(2,R) = ''KAK'' with ''K'' = SO(2) and ''A'' the subgroup of positive diagonal matrices. ''K'' corresponds to the diagonal matrices in SU(1,1). Since evidently ''K'' acts unitarily on ''H''&lt;sub&gt;œÉ&lt;/sub&gt; and ''A'' acts unitarily on ''H'' '&lt;sub&gt;œÉ&lt;/sub&gt;, both representations are unitary. The representations are irreducible because the action of the Lie algebra on the basis vectors ''f''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is irreducible. This family of irreducible unitary representations is called the '''complementary series'''.

{{harvtxt|Ehrenpreis|Mautner|1955}} constructed an analytic continuation of this family of representations as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lohou√©|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''s'' = œÉ + iœÑ, g lies in SU(1,1) and ''f'' in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;œÉ&lt;/sub&gt;, define

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\pi_s(g^{-1}) f(z)=|\overline{\beta}z+\overline{\alpha}|^{1-2s}f\left({\alpha z +\beta\over\overline{\beta}z +\overline{\alpha}}\right).}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly if ''g'' ' lies in SL(2,'''R''') and ''F'' in  ''H'' '&lt;sub&gt;œÉ&lt;/sub&gt;, define

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\pi^\prime_s((g^\prime)^{-1}) F(x) =|cx+d|^{1-2s} F\left({ax+b\over cx +d}\right).}&lt;/math&gt;

As before the unitary ''U'' intertwines these two actions. ''K'' acts unitarily on ''H''&lt;sub&gt;œÉ&lt;/sub&gt; and ''A'' by a uniformly bounded representation on ''H'' '&lt;sub&gt;œÉ&lt;/sub&gt;. The action of the standard basis of the complexification Lie algebra on this basis can be computed:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bargmann|1947|p=613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\pi_s(L_0)f_m=mf_m, \,\, \pi_s(L_{-1})f_m=-(m+1/2+s)f_{m+1},\,\, \pi_s(L_1)f_m=-(m-1/2-s)f_{m-1}.}&lt;/math&gt;

If the representation were unitarizable for œÑ ‚â† 0, then the similarity operator ''T'' on ''H''&lt;sub&gt;œÉ&lt;/sub&gt; would have to commute with ''K'', since ''K'' preserves the original inner product. The vectors ''Tf''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; would therefore still be orthogonal for the new inner product and  
the operators

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{L_i^\prime=TL_iT^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

would satisfy the same relations for

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{f_m^\prime = Tf_m=\lambda_m f_m.}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{[L_m^\prime,L_n^\prime]=(m-n)L_{m+n}^\prime,\,\,(L_i^\prime)^*=L_{-i}^\prime.}&lt;/math&gt;

It is elementary to verify that infinitesimally such a representation cannot exist if œÑ ‚â† 0.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Bargmann|1947}}
*{{harvnb|Howe|Tan|1992}}
*{{harvnb|Lang|1985|pp=122‚Äì123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, let ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f'' '&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and set

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{v_1=L^\prime_{-1}v_0.}&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{L^\prime_1 v_1=c v_{0}}&lt;/math&gt;

for some constant ''c''. On the other hand,

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|v_{1}\|^2=(L_{-1}^\prime v_0,v_{1})=(v_0,L_1^\prime v_{1})=\overline{c}\|v_0\|^2.}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus ''c'' must be real and positive. The formulas above show that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{c={1\over 4}-s^2={1\over 4}-\sigma^2 +\tau^2 -2i\sigma\tau,}&lt;/math&gt;

so the representation œÄ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is unitarizable only if œÑ = 0.

===Free group on two generators===
The group ''G'' = SL(2,'''R''') contains the discrete group Œì = SL(2,'''Z''') as a closed subgroup of finite covolume, since this subgroup acts on the upper half plane with a fundamental domain of finite hyperbolic area.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Serre|1977}}
*{{harvnb|Gelfand|Graev|Pyatetskii-Shapiro|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group SL(2,'''Z''') contains a subgroup of index 12 isomorphic to '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the free group on two generators.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Magnus|Karrass|Solitar|1976}}
*{{harvnb|Serre|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence ''G'' has a subgroup Œì&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of finite covolume, isomorphic to '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. If ''L'' is a closed subgroup of finite covolume in a locally compact group ''G'', and œÄ is non-unitarizable uniformly bounded representation of ''G'' on a Hilbert space ''L'', then its restriction to ''L'' is uniformly bounded and non-unitarizable. For if not, applying a bounded invertible operator, the inner product can be made invariant under ''L''; and then in turn invariant under ''G'' by redefining

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(x,y)_1=\int_{H\backslash G} (gx,gy) \, dg.}&lt;/math&gt;

As in the previous proof, uniform boundedess guarantees that the norm defined by this inner product is
equivalent to the original inner product. But then the original representation would be unitarizable on ''G'', a contradiction. The same argument works for any discrete subgroup of ''G'' of finite covolume. In particular the [[surface group]]s, which are cocompact subgroups, have uniformly bounded representations that are not unitarizable.

There are more direct constructions of uniformly bounded representations of free groups that are non-unitarizable: these are surveyed in {{harvtxt|Pisier|2001}}. The first such examples are described in 
{{harvtxt|Fig√†-Talamanca|Picardello|1983}}, where an analogue of the complementary series is constructed.

Later {{harvtxt|Szwarc|1988}} gave a related but simpler construction, on the Hilbert space ''H'' = &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), of a holomorphic family of uniformly bounded representations œÄ&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; of '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for  |z| &lt; 1; these are non-unitarizable when  1/‚àö3 &lt; |''z''| &lt; 1 and ''z'' is not real. Let ''L''(''g'') denote the reduced word length on '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for a given set of generators ''a'', ''b''. Let ''T'' be the bounded operator defined on basis elements by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{Te_1=0,\,\, Te_g=e_{g^\prime},}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g'' ' is obtained by erasing the last letter in the expression of ''g'' as a reduced word; identifying ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with the vertices of its [[Cayley graph]], a rooted tree,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Serre|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; this corresponds to passing from a vertex to the next closest vertex to the origin or root. For |z| &lt; 1

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\pi_z(g) = (I-zT)^{-1}\lambda(g)(I-zT)}&lt;/math&gt;

is well-defined on finitely supported functions. {{harvtxt|Pytlik|Szwarc|1986}} had earlier proved that it extends to a uniformly bounded representation on ''H'' satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|\pi_z(g)\|\le {1+|z|\over 1-|z|}.}&lt;/math&gt;

In fact it is easy to check that the operator 
Œª(''g'')''T''Œª(''g'')&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt; ‚Äì ''T'' has finite rank, with range''V''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;, the finite-dimensional space of functions supported on the set of vertices joining ''g'' to the origin. For on any function vanishing on this finite set, ''T'' and Œª(''g'')''T''Œª(''g'')&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt; are equal; and they both leave invariant ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;, on which they acts as contractions and adjoints of each other. Hence if ''f'' has finite support and norm 1,

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|\pi_z(g)f\|=\|\lambda(g)f+\sum_{n=0}^\infty z^{n+1} T^n[T,\lambda(g)]f\|\le 1 + 2 \sum_{n=0}^n |z|^{n+1} ={1+|z|\over 1-|z|}.}&lt;/math&gt;

For |z| &lt; 1/‚àö3, these representations are all similar to the regular representation Œª. If on the other hand 1/‚àö3 &lt; |z| &lt;1, then the operator

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{D=\pi_z(a)+\pi_z(a^{-1}) + \pi_z(b) +\pi_z(b^{-1})}&lt;/math&gt;

satisfies

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{Df=(3z +z^{-1})f}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' in ''H'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{f(1)=1,\,\, f(g)={3\over 4} (3z)^{-L(g)} \,\,(g\ne 1).}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, if ''z'' is not real, ''D'' has an eigenvalue which is not real. But then œÄ&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; cannot be unitarizable, since otherwise ''D'' would be similar to a self-adjoint operator.

==The Dixmier Problem==
[[Jacques Dixmier]] asked in 1950 whether amenable groups are characterized by '''unitarizability''', i.e. the property that all their uniformly bounded representations are unitarizable.  This problem remains open to this day.

An elementary [[induced representation|induction]] argument shows that a subgroup of a unitarizable group remains unitarizable.  Therefore, the [[von Neumann conjecture]] would have implied a positive answer to Dixmier's problem, had it been true.  In any case, it follows that a counter-example to Dixmier's conjecture could only be a non-amenable group without free subgroups. In particular, Dixmier's conjecture is true for all [[linear group]]s by the [[Tits alternative]].

A criterion due to Epstein and [[Nicolas Monod|Monod]] shows that there are also non-unitarizable groups without free subgroups. In fact, even some [[Burnside group]]s are non-unitarizable, as shown by Monod and Ozawa.

Considerable progress has been made by [[Gilles Pisier|Pisier]] who linked unitarizability to a notion of factorization length. This allowed him to solve a modified form of the Dixmier problem.

The potential gap between unitarizability and amenability can be further illustrated by the following open problems, all of which become elementary if "unitarizable" were replaced by "amenable":

*Is the [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of two unitarizable groups unitarizable?
*Is a directed union of unitarizable groups unitarizable?
*If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; contains a normal amenable subgroup &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such &lt;math&gt;G/N&lt;/math&gt; is unitarizable, does it follow that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is unitarizable? (It is elementary that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is unitarizable if &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is so and &lt;math&gt;G/N&lt;/math&gt; is amenable.)

In [[geometry]], a '''[[ball (mathematics)|ball]]''' is a region in space comprising all points within a fixed distance from a given point; that is, it is the region enclosed by a [[sphere]] or [[hypersphere]]. An {{math|''n''}}-ball is a ball in {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. The '''volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball''' is an important constant that occurs in formulas throughout mathematics; it generalizes the notion of the volume enclosed by a sphere in 3-dimensional space.

== Formulas ==

=== The volume ===
The {{math|''n''}}-dimensional volume of a Euclidean ball of radius {{math|''R''}} in {{math|''n''}}-dimensional Euclidean space is:&lt;ref&gt;Equation 5.19.4, ''NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions.'' http://dlmf.nist.gov/, Release 1.0.6 of 2013-05-06.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) = \frac{\pi^\frac{n}{2}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2} + 1\right)}R^n,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|Œì}} is [[Leonhard Euler]]'s [[gamma function]] (which can be thought of as an extension of the [[factorial]] function to noninteger arguments). Using explicit formulas for [[particular values of the gamma function]] at the integers and half integers gives formulas for the volume of a Euclidean ball that do not require an evaluation of the gamma function. These are:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}V_{2k}(R) &amp;= \frac{\pi^k}{k!}R^{2k}, \\
V_{2k+1}(R) &amp;= \frac{2^{k+1}\pi^k}{(2k+1)!!}R^{2k+1} = \frac{2(k!)(4\pi)^k}{(2k+1)!}R^{2k+1}.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
In the formula for odd-dimensional volumes, the [[double factorial]] {{math|(2''k'' + 1)!!}} is defined for odd integers {{math|2''k'' + 1}} as {{math|(2''k'' + 1)!! {{=}} 1 ¬∑ 3 ¬∑ 5 ¬∑ ‚Ä¶ ¬∑ (2''k'' ‚àí 1) ¬∑ (2''k'' + 1)}}.

Instead of expressing the volume {{math|''V''}} of the ball in terms of its radius {{math|''R''}}, the formula can be [[Inverse function|inverted]] to express the radius as a function of the volume:
:&lt;math&gt;R_n(V) = \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2} + 1\right)^\frac{1}{n}}{\sqrt{\pi}}V^\frac{1}{n}.&lt;/math&gt;
This formula, too, can be separated into even- and odd-dimensional cases using factorials and double factorials in place of the gamma function:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}R_{2k}(V) &amp;= \frac{(k!V)^\frac{1}{2k}}{\sqrt{\pi}}, \\
R_{2k+1}(V) &amp;= \left(\frac{(2k+1)!!V}{2^{k+1}\pi^k}\right)^\frac{1}{2k+1}.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Recursions ===
The volume satisfies several recursive formulas. These formulas can either be proved directly or proved as consequences of the general volume formula above. The simplest to state is a formula for the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball in terms of the volume of an {{math|(''n'' ‚àí 2)}}-ball of the same radius:
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) = \frac{2\pi R^2}{n} V_{n-2}(R).&lt;/math&gt;

There is also a formula for the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball in terms of the volume of an {{math|(''n'' ‚àí 1)}}-ball of the same radius:
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) = R\sqrt{\pi}\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2} + 1\right)} V_{n-1}(R).&lt;/math&gt;
Using explicit formulas for the gamma function again shows that the one-dimension recursion formula can also be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
V_{2k}(R) &amp;= R\pi \frac{(2k - 1)!!}{2^k k!} V_{2k-1}(R) = R\pi \frac{(2k-1)(2k-3) \cdots 5 \cdot 3 \cdot 1}{(2k)(2k - 2) \cdots 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 2} V_{2k-1}(R), \\[10px]
V_{2k+1}(R) &amp;= 2R\frac{2^k k!}{(2k+1)!!} V_{2k}(R) = 2R\frac{(2k)(2k - 2) \cdots 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 2}{(2k-1)(2k-3) \cdots 5 \cdot 3 \cdot 1} V_{2k}(R).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The radius of an {{math|''n''}}-ball of volume {{math|''V''}} may be expressed recursively in terms of the radius of an {{math|(''n'' ‚àí 1)}}-ball or an {{math|(''n'' ‚àí 2)}}-ball.  These formulas may be derived from the explicit formula for {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''V'')}} above.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
R_n(V) &amp;= \frac{\Gamma(\frac{n}{2} + 1)^{1/n}}{\Gamma(\frac{n-1}{2} + 1)^{1/(n-1)}}V^{-1/(n(n-1))}R_{n-1}(V), \\
R_n(V) &amp;= \left(\frac{n}{2}\right)^{1/n}\left(V \cdot \Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)\right)^{-2/(n(n-2))}R_{n-2}(V).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Using explicit formulas for the gamma function shows that the one-dimension recursion formula is equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
R_{2k}(V)
&amp;= \frac{(2^kk!)^{1/(2k)}}{(2k-1)!!^{1/(2k-1)}}\left(\frac{2}{\pi}\right)^{1/(4k-2)}V^{-1/(2k(2k-1))} R_{2k-1}(V) \\
&amp;= \frac{\big((2k)(2k - 2) \cdots 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 2\big)^{1/(2k)}}{\big((2k - 1)(2k - 3) \cdots 5 \cdot 3 \cdot 1\big)^{1/(2k-1)}} \left(\frac{2}{\pi}\right)^{1/(4k-2)}V^{-1/(2k(2k-1))} R_{2k-1}(V), \\
R_{2k+1}(V)
&amp;= \frac{(2k+1)!!^{1/(2k+1)}}{(2^k k!)^{1/(2k)}} \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{1/(4k+2)} V^{-1/((2k+1)2k)} R_{2k}(V) \\
&amp;= \frac{\big((2k + 1)(2k - 1) \cdots 5 \cdot 3 \cdot 1\big)^{1/(2k+1)}}{\big((2k)(2k - 2) \cdots 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 2\big)^{1/(2k)}} \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{1/(4k+2)} V^{-1/((2k+1)2k)} R_{2k}(V), \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and that the two-dimension recursion formula is equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
R_{2k}(V)
&amp;= k^{1/(2k)} (V \cdot (k-1)!)^{-1/(2(k-1)k)} R_{2k-2}(V) \\
&amp;= k^{1/(2k)} (V \cdot (k-1) \cdot (k-2) \cdots 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1)^{-1/(2(k-1)k)} R_{2k-2}(V), \\
R_{2k+1}(V)
&amp;= (2k + 1)^{1/(2k+1)} \left(V \cdot (2k - 1)!!\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\right)^{-2/(4k^2 - 1)} R_{2k-1}(V) \\
&amp;= (2k + 1)^{1/(2k+1)} \left(V \cdot (2k - 1)(2k - 3) \cdots 5 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\right)^{-2/(4k^2-1)} R_{2k-1}(V).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Low dimensions ===
In low dimensions, these volume and radius formulas simplify to the following, which demonstrates that the volume of the unit ''n''-sphere peaks at dimension 5.

=== High dimensions ===

Suppose that {{math|''R''}} is fixed. Then the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball of radius {{math|''R''}} approaches zero as {{math|''n''}} tends to infinity. This can be shown using the two-dimension recursion formula. At each step, the new factor being multiplied into the volume is proportional to {{math|1 / ''n''}}, where the constant of proportionality {{math|2œÄ''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is independent of {{math|''n''}}. Eventually, {{math|''n''}} is so large that the new factor is less than 1. From then on, the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball must decrease at least geometrically, and therefore it tends to zero. A variant on this proof uses the one-dimension recursion formula. Here, the new factor is proportional to a quotient of gamma functions. [[Gautschi's inequality]] bounds this quotient above by {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1/2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The argument concludes as before by showing that the volumes decrease at least geometrically.

A more precise description of the high dimensional behavior of the volume can be obtained using [[Stirling's approximation]]. It implies the [[asymptotic formula]]:
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{n\pi}}\left(\frac{2\pi e}{n}\right)^\frac{n}{2}R^n.&lt;/math&gt;
The error in this approximation is a factor of {{math|1 + O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. Stirling's approximation is in fact an underestimate of the gamma function, so the above formula is an upper bound. This provides another proof that the volume of the ball decreases exponentially: When {{math|''n''}} is sufficiently large, the factor {{math|''R''{{sqrt|2œÄ''e''/''n''}}}} is less than one, and then the same argument as before applies.

If instead {{math|''V''}} is fixed while {{math|''n''}} is large, then by Stirling's approximation again, the radius of an {{math|''n''}}-ball of volume {{math|''V''}} is approximately
:&lt;math&gt;R_n(V) \sim (\pi n)^{\frac{1}{2n}}\sqrt{\frac{n}{2\pi e}}V^{\frac{1}{n}}.&lt;/math&gt;
This expression is a lower bound for {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''V'')}}, and the error is again a factor of {{math|1 + O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. As {{math|''n''}} increases, {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''V'')}} grows as {{math|O({{sqrt|n}})}}.

=== Relation with surface area ===

Let {{math|''A{{sub|n}}''(''R'')}} denote the surface area of the [[n-sphere|{{math|''n''}}-sphere]] of radius {{math|''R''}}. The {{math|''n''}}-sphere is the boundary of the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball of radius {{math|''R''}}. The {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball is a union of concentric spheres, and consequently the surface area and the volume are related by:
:&lt;math&gt;A_n(R) = \frac{d}{dR}V_{n+1}(R).&lt;/math&gt;

Since the volume is proportional to a power of the radius, the above relation leads to a simple recurrence equation relating the surface area of an {{math|''n''}}-ball and the volume of an {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball. By applying the two-dimension recursion formula, it also gives a recurrence equation relating the surface area of an {{math|''n''}}-ball and the volume of an {{math|(''n'' ‚àí 1)}}-ball:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
V_0(R) &amp;= 1, \\
A_0(R) &amp;= 2, \\
V_{n+1}(R) &amp;= \frac{R}{n+1}A_n(R), \\
A_{n+1}(R) &amp;= (2\pi R)V_n(R).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Proofs ==
There are many proofs of the above formulas.

=== The volume is proportional to the {{math|''n''}}th power of the radius ===
An important step in several proofs about volumes of {{math|''n''}}-balls, and a generally useful fact besides, is that the volume of the {{math|''n''}}-ball of radius {{math|''R''}} is proportional to {{math|''R''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}:
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) \propto R^n.&lt;/math&gt;
The proportionality constant is the volume of the unit ball.

This is a special case of a general fact about volumes in {{math|''n''}}-dimensional space: If {{math|''K''}}
is a body (measurable set) in that space and {{math|''RK''}} is the body obtained by stretching in all directions by the factor {{math|''R''}} then the volume of {{math|''RK''}} equals {{math|''R''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} times the volume of {{math|''K''}}. This is a direct consequence of the change of variables formula:
:&lt;math&gt; V(RK) = \int_{RK} dx = \int_K R^n\, dy = R^n V(K) &lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|1=''dx'' = ''dx''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;‚Ä¶''dx&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and the substitution {{math|1=''x'' = ''Ry''}} was made.

Another proof of the above relation, which avoids multi-dimensional integration, uses induction: The base case is {{math|''n'' {{=}} 0}}, where the proportionality is obvious. For the inductive case, assume that proportionality is true in dimension {{math|''n'' ‚àí 1}}. Note that the intersection of an {{math|''n''}}-ball with a hyperplane is an {{math|(''n'' ‚àí 1)}}-ball. When the volume of the {{math|''n''}}-ball is written as an integral of volumes of {{math|(''n'' ‚àí 1)}}-balls:
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) = \int_{-R}^R V_{n-1}\left(\sqrt{R^2 - x^2}\right) \,dx,&lt;/math&gt;
it is possible by the inductive assumption to remove a factor of {{math|''R''}} from the radius of the {{math|(''n'' ‚àí 1)}}-ball to get:
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) = R^{n-1} \int_{-R}^R V_{n-1}\left(\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{x}{R}\right)^2}\right) \,dx.&lt;/math&gt;
Making the change of variables {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''{{sfrac|x|R}}''}} leads to:
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) = R^n \int_{-1}^1 V_{n-1}\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) \,dt = R^n V_n(1),&lt;/math&gt;
which demonstrates the proportionality relation in dimension {{math|''n''}}. By induction, the proportionality relation is true in all dimensions.

=== The two-dimension recursion formula ===
A proof of the recursion formula relating the volume of the {{math|''n''}}-ball and an {{math|(''n'' ‚àí 2)}}-ball can be given using the proportionality formula above and integration in [[Cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]]. Fix a plane through the center of the ball. Let {{math|''r''}} denote the distance between a point in the plane and the center of the sphere, and let {{math|''Œ∏''}} denote the azimuth. Intersecting the {{math|''n''}}-ball with the {{math|(''n'' ‚àí 2)}}-dimensional plane defined by fixing a radius and an azimuth gives an {{math|(''n'' ‚àí 2)}}-ball of radius {{math|{{sqrt|''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}. The volume of the ball can therefore be written as an iterated integral of the volumes of the {{math|(''n'' ‚àí 2)}}-balls over the possible radii and azimuths:
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^R V_{n-2}\left(\sqrt{R^2 - r^2}\right) \,r\,dr\,d\theta,&lt;/math&gt;
The azimuthal coordinate can be immediately integrated out. Applying the proportionality relation shows that the volume equals:
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) = 2\pi V_{n-2}(R) \int_0^R \left(1 - \left(\frac{r}{R}\right)^2\right)^\frac{n-2}{2}\,r\,dr.&lt;/math&gt;
The integral can be evaluated by making the substitution {{math|''u'' {{=}} 1 ‚àí (''{{sfrac|r|R}}''){{su|p=2}}}} to get:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
V_n(R) &amp;= 2\pi V_{n-2}(R) \cdot \left[-\frac{R^2}{n}\left(1 - \left(\frac{r}{R}\right)^2\right)^\frac{n}{2}\right]_{r=0}^{r=R} \\
&amp;= \frac{2\pi R^2}{n} V_{n-2}(R),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
which is the two-dimension recursion formula.

The same technique can be used to give an inductive proof of the volume formula. The base cases of the induction are the 0-ball and the 1-ball, which can be checked directly using the facts {{math|Œì(1) {{=}} 1}} and {{math|Œì({{sfrac|3|2}}) {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}} ¬∑ Œì({{sfrac|1|2}}) {{=}} {{sfrac|{{sqrt|œÄ}}|2}}}}. The inductive step is similar to the above, but instead of applying proportionality to the volumes of the {{math|(''n'' ‚àí 2)}}-balls, the inductive assumption is applied instead.

=== The one-dimension recursion formula ===
The proportionality relation can also be used to prove the recursion formula relating the volumes of an {{math|''n''}}-ball and an {{math|(''n'' ‚àí 1)}}-ball. As in the proof of the proportionality formula, the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball can be written as an integral over the volumes of {{math|(''n'' ‚àí 1)}}-balls. Instead of making a substitution, however, the proportionality relation can be applied to the volumes of the {{math|(''n'' ‚àí 1)}}-balls in the integrand:
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) = V_{n-1}(R) \int_{-R}^R \left(1 - \left(\frac{x}{R}\right)^2\right)^\frac{n-1}{2} \,dx.&lt;/math&gt;
The integrand is an [[even function]], so by symmetry the interval of integration can be restricted to {{math|[0, ''R'']}}. On the interval {{math|[0, ''R'']}}, it is possible to apply the substitution {{math|''u'' {{=}} (''{{sfrac|x|R}}''){{su|p=2}}}}. This transforms the expression into:
:&lt;math&gt;V_{n-1}(R) \cdot R \cdot \int_0^1 (1-u)^\frac{n-1}{2}u^{-\frac12}\,du&lt;/math&gt;
The integral is a value of a well-known [[special function]] called the [[beta function]] {{math|Œí(''x'')}}, and the volume in terms of the beta function is:
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) = V_{n-1}(R) \cdot R \cdot B\left(\tfrac{n + 1}{2}, \tfrac12\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The beta function can be expressed in terms of the gamma function in much the same way that factorials are related to [[binomial coefficient]]s. Applying this relationship gives:
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) = V_{n-1}(R) \cdot R \cdot \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n + 1}{2}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac12\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2} + 1\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;
Using the value {{math|Œì({{sfrac|1|2}}) {{=}} {{sqrt|œÄ}}}} gives the one-dimension recursion formula:
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) = R\sqrt{\pi}\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2} + 1\right)} V_{n-1}(R).&lt;/math&gt;

As with the two-dimension recursive formula, the same technique can be used to give an inductive proof of the volume formula.

=== Direct integration in spherical coordinates ===
The volume can be computed by integrating the volume element in [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]]. The spherical coordinate system has a radial coordinate {{math|''r''}} and angular coordinates {{math|''œÜ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ‚Ä¶, ''œÜ''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' ‚àí 1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where the domain of each {{math|''œÜ''}} except {{math|''œÜ''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' ‚àí 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is {{math|[0, œÄ)}}, and the domain of {{math|''œÜ''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' ‚àí 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is {{math|[0, 2œÄ)}}. The spherical volume element is:
:&lt;math&gt;dV = r^{n-1}\sin^{n-2}(\varphi_1)\sin^{n-3}(\varphi_2) \cdots \sin(\varphi_{n-2})\,dr\,d\varphi_1\,d\varphi_2 \cdots d\varphi_{n-1},&lt;/math&gt;
and the volume is the integral of this quantity over {{math|''r''}} between 0 and {{math|''R''}} and all possible angles:
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) = \int_0^R \int_0^\pi \cdots \int_0^{2\pi} r^{n-1}\sin^{n-2}(\varphi_1) \cdots \sin(\varphi_{n-2})\,d\varphi_{n-1} \cdots d\varphi_1\,dr.&lt;/math&gt;
Each of the factors in the integrand depends on only a single variable, and therefore the iterated integral can be written as a product of integrals:
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) = \left(\int_0^R r^{n-1}\,dr\right)\left(\int_0^\pi \sin^{n-2}(\varphi_1)\,d\varphi_1\right)\cdots\left(\int_0^{2\pi} d\varphi_{n-1}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The integral over the radius is {{math|''{{sfrac|R&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;|n}}''}}. The intervals of integration on the angular coordinates can, by symmetry, be changed to {{math|[0, {{sfrac|œÄ|2}}]}}:
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) = \frac{R^n}{n} \left(2\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \sin^{n-2}(\varphi_1)\,d\varphi_1\right) \cdots \left(4\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} d\varphi_{n-1}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
Each of the remaining integrals is now a particular value of the beta function:
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) = \frac{R^n}{n} \textstyle B\left(\frac{n-1}{2}, \frac12\right) B\left(\frac{n-2}{2}, \frac12\right) \cdots B\left(1, \frac12\right) \cdot 2B\left(\frac12, \frac12\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The beta functions can be rewritten in terms of gamma functions:
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) = \frac{R^n}{n} \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac12\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)} \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n-2}{2}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac12\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n - 1}{2}\right)} \cdots \frac{\Gamma\left(1\right)\Gamma\left(\frac12\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac32\right)} \cdot 2 \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac12\right)\Gamma\left(\frac12\right)}{\Gamma\left(1\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;
This product telescopes. Combining this with the values {{math|Œì({{sfrac|1|2}}) {{=}} {{sqrt|œÄ}}}} and {{math|Œì(1) {{=}} 1}} and the functional equation {{math|''z''Œì(''z'') {{=}} Œì(''z'' + 1)}} leads to:
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) = \frac{2\pi^\frac{n}{2}R^n}{n\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)} = \frac{\pi^\frac{n}{2}R^n}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2} + 1\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Gaussian integrals ===
The volume formula can be proven directly using [[Gaussian integral]]s. Consider the function:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \exp\left(-\tfrac12 \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\right).&lt;/math&gt;
This function is both rotationally invariant and a product of functions of one variable each. Using the fact that it is a product and the formula for the Gaussian integral gives:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbf{R}^n} f \,dV = \prod_{i=1}^n \left(\int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp\left(-\tfrac12 x_i^2\right)\,dx_i\right) = (2\pi)^\frac{n}{2},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''dV''}} is the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional volume element. Using rotational invariance, the same integral can be computed in spherical coordinates:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbf{R}^n} f \,dV = \int_0^\infty \int_{S^{n-1}(r)} \exp\left(-\tfrac12 r^2\right) \,dA\,dr,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' ‚àí 1&lt;/sup&gt;(''r'')}} is an {{math|(''n'' ‚àí 1)}}-sphere of radius {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''dA''}} is the area element (equivalently, the {{math|(''n'' ‚àí 1)}}-dimensional volume element). The surface area of the sphere satisfies a proportionality equation similar to the one for the volume of a ball: If {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' ‚àí 1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'')}} is the surface area of an {{math|(''n'' ‚àí 1)}}-sphere of radius {{math|''r''}}, then:
:&lt;math&gt;A_{n-1}(r) = r^{n-1} A_{n-1}(1).&lt;/math&gt;
Applying this to the above integral gives the expression:
:&lt;math&gt;A_{n-1}(1) \int_0^\infty \exp\left(-\tfrac12 r^2\right)\,r^{n-1}\,dr.&lt;/math&gt;
By substituting {{math|''t'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|2}}}}, the expression is transformed into:
:&lt;math&gt;A_{n-1}(1) 2^\frac{n-2}{2} \int_0^\infty e^{-t} t^\frac{n-2}{2}\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;
This is the gamma function evaluated at {{math|{{sfrac|''n''|2}}}}.

Combining the two integrations shows that:
:&lt;math&gt;A_{n-1}(1) = \frac{2\pi^\frac{n}{2}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;
To derive the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball of radius {{math|''R''}} from this formula, integrate the surface area of a sphere of radius {{math|''r''}} for {{math|0 ‚â§ ''r'' ‚â§ ''R''}} and apply the functional equation {{math|''z''Œì(''z'') {{=}} Œì(''z'' + 1)}}:
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) = \int_0^R \frac{2\pi^\frac{n}{2}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)} \,r^{n-1}\,dr = \frac{2\pi^\frac{n}{2}}{n\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)}R^n = \frac{\pi^\frac{n}{2}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2} + 1\right)}R^n.&lt;/math&gt;

== Balls in {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} norms ==
There are also explicit expressions for the volumes of balls in [[Lp space|{{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} norm]]s. The {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} norm of the vector {{math|''x'' {{=}} (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ‚Ä¶, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is:
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\sum_{i=1}^n | x_i |^p \right)^\frac{1}{p},&lt;/math&gt;
and an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} ball is the set of all vectors whose {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} norm is less than or equal to a fixed number called the radius of the ball. The case {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}} is the standard Euclidean distance function, but other values of {{math|''p''}} occur in diverse contexts such as [[information theory]], [[coding theory]], and [[dimensional regularization]].

The volume of an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} ball of radius {{math|''R''}} is:
:&lt;math&gt;V^p_n(R) = \frac{\left(2\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{p} + 1\right)R\right)^n}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{p} + 1\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;
These volumes satisfy a recurrence relation similar to the one dimension recurrence for {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}}:
:&lt;math&gt;V^p_n(R) = \left(2\Gamma\left(\tfrac{1}{p} + 1\right) R\right) \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n-1}{p} + 1\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{p} + 1\right)} V^p_{n-1}(R).&lt;/math&gt;
For {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}}, one recovers the recurrence for the volume of a Euclidean ball because {{math|2Œì({{sfrac|3|2}}) {{=}} {{sqrt|œÄ}}}}.

For example, in the cases {{math|''p'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''p'' {{=}} ‚àû}}, the volumes are:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} V^1_n(R) &amp;= \frac{2^n}{n!}R^n, \\ V^\infty_n(R) &amp;= (2R)^n. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
These agree with elementary calculations of the volumes of [[cross-polytope]]s and [[hypercubes]].

=== Relation with surface area ===
For most values of {{math|''p''}}, the surface area of an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} sphere (the boundary of an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} ball) cannot be calculated by differentiating the volume of an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} ball with respect to its radius. While the volume can be expressed as an integral over the surface areas using the [[coarea formula]], the coarea formula contains a correction factor that accounts for how the {{math|''p''}}-norm varies from point to point. For {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}} and {{math|''p'' {{=}} ‚àû}}, this factor is one. However, if {{math|''p'' {{=}} 1}} then the correction factor is {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}}}: the surface area of an {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} sphere of radius {{math|''R''}} in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}}} times the derivative of the volume of an {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} ball.  This can be seen most simply by applying the [[divergence theorem]] to the vector field {{math|'''F'''(x) {{=}} x}} to get

:&lt;math&gt;nV^1_n(R) = &lt;/math&gt;{{oiint
| preintegral = &lt;math&gt;\iiint_V\left(\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{F}\right)\,dV=&lt;/math&gt;
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{n})\,dS &lt;/math&gt;
}} &lt;math&gt; = &lt;/math&gt; {{oiint
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}(x_1+\cdots+x_n)\,dS &lt;/math&gt;
}}  &lt;math&gt; = \frac{R}{\sqrt{n}} &lt;/math&gt;{{oiint
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;\,dS &lt;/math&gt;
}} &lt;math&gt; = \frac{R}{\sqrt{n}} A^1_n(R) &lt;/math&gt;.
For other values of {{math|''p''}}, the constant is a complicated integral.

=== Generalizations ===
The volume formula can be generalized even further. For positive real numbers {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ‚Ä¶, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, define the unit {{math|(''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ‚Ä¶, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} ball to be:
:&lt;math&gt;B_{p_1, \ldots, p_n} = \left\{ x = (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \in \mathbf{R}^n : \vert x_1 \vert^{p_1} + \cdots + \vert x_n \vert^{p_n} \le 1 \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
The volume of this ball has been known since the time of Dirichlet:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dirichlet|first=P. G. Lejeune|title=Sur une nouvelle m√©thode pour la d√©termination des int√©grales multiples|trans-title=On a novel method for determining multiple integrals|journal=Journal de Math√©matiques Pures et Appliqu√©es|volume=4|date=1839|pages=164‚Äì168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Xianfu|title=Volumes of Generalized Unit Balls|journal=Mathematics Magazine|volume=8|issue=5|date=Dec 2005|pages=390‚Äì395}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V(B_{p_1, \ldots, p_n}) = 2^n \frac{\Gamma\left(1 + \frac{1}{p_1}\right) \cdots \Gamma\left(1 + \frac{1}{p_n}\right)}{\Gamma\left(1 + \frac{1}{p_1} + \cdots + \frac{1}{p_n}\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

In mathematics applied to the study of networks, the '''Wiener connector''', named in honor of chemist [[Harry Wiener]] who first introduced the [[Wiener Index]], is a means of maximizing efficiency in connecting specified "query vertices" in a network. Given a [[connected graph|connected]], [[undirected graph]] and a set of query vertices in a graph, the '''minimum Wiener connector''' is an [[induced subgraph]] that connects the query vertices and minimizes the sum of [[shortest path]] distances among all pairs of vertices in the subgraph. In [[combinatorial optimization]], the '''minimum Wiener connector problem''' is the problem of finding the minimum Wiener connector. It can be thought of as a version of the classic [[Steiner tree problem]] (one of [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems]]), where instead of minimizing the size of the tree, the objective is to minimize the distances in the subgraph.&lt;ref name="steiner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hwang|first1=Frank|last2=Richards|first2=Dana|last3=Winter|first3=Dana|last4=Winter|first4=Pawel|title=The Steiner Tree Problem|journal=Annals of Discrete Mathematics|date=1992|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/bookseries/01675060/53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dimacs"&gt;[http://dimacs11.cs.princeton.edu/ DIMACS Steiner Tree Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimum Wiener connector was first presented by Ruchansky, et al. in 2015.&lt;ref name="sigmod"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bonchi|first2=Francesco|last3=Garcia-Soriano|first3=David|last4=Gullo|first4=Francesco|last5=Kourtellis|first5=Nicolas|date=2015|year=|title=The Minimum Wiener Connector|arxiv=1504.00513|journal=SIGMOD|volume=|pages=|via=|last1=Ruchansky|first1=Natali|bibcode=2015arXiv150400513R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimum Wiener connector has applications in many domains where there is a graph structure and an interest in learning about connections between sets of individuals. For example, given a set of patients infected with a viral disease, which other patients should be checked to find the culprit? Or given a set of proteins of interest, which other proteins participate in pathways with them?

==Problem definition==
The [[Wiener index]] is the sum of shortest path distances in a (sub)graph. Using &lt;math&gt;d(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; to denote the shortest path between &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, the Wiener index of a (sub)graph &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;W(S)&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as
: &lt;math&gt;W(S) = \sum_{(u, v) \in S} d(u,v)&lt;/math&gt;.

The minimum Wiener connector problem is defined as follows. Given an undirected and unweighted graph with vertex set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and edge set &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and a set of query vertices &lt;math&gt;Q\subseteq V&lt;/math&gt;, find a connector &lt;math&gt;H\subseteq V&lt;/math&gt; of minimum Wiener index. More formally, the problem is to compute
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname*{arg\,min}_H W(H\cup Q)&lt;/math&gt;,
that is, find a connector &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes the sum of shortest paths in &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

==Relationship to Steiner tree==
[[File:SteinerExample nicer.pdf|thumb|upright=2.0|The optimal solutions to the Steiner tree problem and the minimum Wiener connector can differ. Define the set of query vertices ''Q'' by ''Q'' = {''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;}. The unique optimal solution to the Steiner tree problem is ''Q'' itself, which has Wiener index 165, whereas the optimal solution for the minimum Wiener connector problem is ''Q'' ‚à™ {''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}, which has Wiener index 142.]]
The minimum Wiener connector problem is related to the [[Steiner tree problem]]. In the former, the [[objective function]] in the minimization is the Wiener index of the connector, whereas in the latter, the objective function is the sum of the weights of the edges in the connector. The optimum solutions to these problems may differ, given the same graph and set of query vertices. In fact, a solution for the Steiner tree problem may be arbitrarily bad for the minimum Wiener connector problem; the graph on the right provides an example.

== Computational complexity ==

===Hardness===
The problem is [[NP-hard]], and does not admit a [[polynomial-time approximation scheme]] unless [[P = NP|'''P''' = '''NP''']].&lt;ref name="sigmod"/&gt; This can be proven using the [[inapproximability]] of [[vertex cover]] in bounded degree graphs.&lt;ref name="dinursafra"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dinur|first1=Irit|last2=Safra|first2=Samuel|title=On the hardness of approximating minimum vertex cover|journal=Annals of Mathematics|date=2005|doi=10.4007/annals.2005.162.439|volume=162|pages=439‚Äì485}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no polynomial-time approximation scheme, there is a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation‚Äîan algorithm that finds a connector whose Wiener index is within a constant multiplicative factor of the Wiener index of the optimum connector. In terms of [[complexity class]]es, the minimum Wiener connector problem is in '''[[APX]]''' but is not in '''PTAS''' unless '''P''' = '''NP'''.

=== Exact algorithms ===
An exhaustive search over all possible subsets of vertices to find the one that induces the connector of minimum Wiener index yields an algorithm that finds the optimum solution in &lt;math&gt;2^{O(n)}&lt;/math&gt; time (that is, [[exponential time]]) on graphs with ''n'' vertices. In the special case that there are exactly two query vertices, the optimum solution is the [[shortest path]] joining the two vertices, so the problem can be solved in [[polynomial time]] by computing the shortest path. In fact, for any fixed constant number of query vertices, an optimum solution can be found in polynomial time.

=== Approximation algorithms ===
There is a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the minimum Wiener connector problem that runs in time &lt;math&gt;O(q (m \log n + n \log^2 n))&lt;/math&gt; on a graph with ''n'' vertices, ''m'' edges, and ''q'' query vertices, roughly the same time it takes to compute shortest-path distances from the query vertices to every other vertex in the graph.&lt;ref name="sigmod"/&gt; The central approach of this algorithm is to reduce the problem to the vertex-weighted Steiner tree problem, which admits a constant-factor approximation in particular instances related to the minimum Wiener connector problem.

==Behavior==

The minimum Wiener connector behaves like [[Centrality#Betweenness centrality|betweenness centrality]].

When the query vertices belong to the same community, the non-query vertices that form the minimum Wiener connector tend to belong to the same community and have high centrality within the community.  Such vertices are likely to be influential vertices playing leadership roles in the community. In a [[social network]], these influential vertices might be good users for spreading information or to target in a viral marketing campaign.&lt;ref name="viral"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Oliver | last1=Hinz | first2=Bernd | last2=Skiera | first3=Christian | last3=Barrot | first4=Jan U. | last4=Becker | title=Seeding Strategies for Viral Marketing: An Empirical Comparison | journal=Journal of Marketing | volume=75 | number=6 | pages=55‚Äì71 | year = 2011 | doi=10.1509/jm.10.0088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the query vertices belong to different communities, the non-query vertices that form the minimum Wiener connector contain vertices adjacent to edges that bridge the different communities. These vertices span a [[Social Network#Structural holes|structural hole]] in the graph and are important.&lt;ref name="structhole"&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Lou|first1=Tiancheng|last2=Tang|first2=Jie|title=Mining Structural Hole Spanners Through Information Diffusion in Social Networks|booktitle=Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web|date=2013|isbn=9781450320351|location=Rio de Janeiro, Brazil|pages=825‚Äì836|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2488388.2488461|publisher=International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The minimum Wiener connector is useful in applications in which one wishes to learn about the relationship between a set of vertices in a graph. For example,
* in [[biology]], it provides insight into how a set of proteins in a [[protein‚Äìprotein interaction]] network are related,
* in [[social network]]s (like [[Twitter]]), it demonstrates the communities to which a set of users belong and how these communities are related,
* in [[computer network]]s, it may be useful in identifying an efficient way to route a [[multicast]] message to a set of destinations.
