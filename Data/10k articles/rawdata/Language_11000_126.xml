==Early life and education==
A. K. Antony was born at [[Cherthala]], near [[Alleppey]] in [[Travancore]]{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} and was the son of Arackaparambil Kurien Pillai and Aleykutty Kurian.&lt;ref name="Antony mother"&gt;{{cite web|title=Antony pays respects to his mother on her anniversary in 2009|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/kerala/article48129.ece|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=2012-02-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331232353/http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/kerala/article48129.ece |archivedate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father died in 1959 and Antony self-financed part of his education through odd jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.timesofindia.com/quickiearticleshow/msid-4569242.cms|title=The Times of India on Mobile|last=|first=|date=2012-06-26|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626221733/http://m.timesofindia.com/quickiearticleshow/msid-4569242.cms|archive-date=2012-06-26|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antony completed his primary education at Holy Family Boys High school (Lower primary) and Government Boys High school (Upper primary), Cherthala (both are mixed higher secondary schools now and the latter has changed its name to Sree Narayana Memorial Government Higher Secondary school) and completed his [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Maharaja's College, Ernakulam]] and [[Bachelor of Law]] from [[Government Law College, Ernakulam]].&lt;ref name="Antony MoD"&gt;{{cite web|title=Antony Takes Over as Defence Minister|url=http://mod.nic.in/samachar/nov1-06/h1.htm|publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (India)|Ministry of Defence]]|accessdate=2012-11-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504125639/http://mod.nic.in/samachar/nov1-06/h1.htm|archivedate=4 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Antony entered politics as a student leader in Cherthala Taluk (Alleppey District) as an activist of the [[Kerala Students Union]] under the guidance of M. A. John.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2011/02/23/stories/2011022358170600.htm M. A. John, Congress leader, passes away], The Hindu, 23 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He has been an active leader of many strikes like ''Oru Ana Samaram'' (Single Penny Strike). He became the youngest president&lt;ref name="Antony appoint Cabinet"/&gt; of [[Kerala Students Union]] in 1966&lt;ref name="Antony appoint Cabinet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Antony: Mr Clean of Indian politics sworn in as Cabinet Minister|url= http://www.whereincity.com/news/3/9998 |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also served in the [[Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee]] (KPCC)  before becoming an All India Congress Committee (AICC) General Secretary in 1984. When he became KPCC president in 1972 he was the youngest person to hold that post. He was elected again as KPCC president in 1987, and was defeated by [[Vayalar Ravi]] in the KPCC presidential elections in 1991.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Congress politics and party faction===
Antony founded the [[Congress (A)]] political party when he split from the [[Indian National Congress (Urs)]], a splinter group of the [[Indian National Congress]] (and opposed [[Indira Gandhi]] in inner party politics during the time when she was prosecuted by the [[Morarji Desai]] government, splitting off from the parent party with [[Devraj Urs]].) The party was primarily active in Kerala and joined the LDF ministry headed by [[E. K. Nayanar]] during 1980-1982. After the fall of the Nayanar ministry, this party merged with the Congress in 1982, but Antony was not given any office until the death of Indira Gandhi. The members of the party have continued as a faction in the local congress afterwards.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Chief Minister of Kerala==

On accusations in the [[Rajan case]], [[K. Karunakaran]] resigned and Antony was made the 8th [[List of Chief Ministers of Kerala|Chief Minister]] of [[Kerala]],&lt;ref name="Antony Delhi"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Hamlet For Delhi: Antony|url= http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?280396 |publisher=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]] |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the youngest [[A.

Again, when Karunakaran resigned in connection with the ISRO case Antony was made the 16th Chief Minister of Kerala, serving from 22 March 1995 to 9 May 1996. He was the Leader of Opposition in the [[Kerala Legislative Assembly]] between 1996-2001. Antony was elected and served a third term from 17 May 2001 to 29 August 2004. He failed to retain power on the first two occasions as Chief minister. In 2004, immediately after the Congress in Kerala suffered a total rout in the Lok Sabha elections amid factional politics and in-fighting within the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]], Antony resigned as Chief Minister.&lt;ref name="Antony appoint Cabinet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Antony Profile"/&gt; He was succeeded by [[Oommen Chandy]].

It was at Antony's behest that the decision to construct the [[Niyamasabha|new Legislature Complex]] was taken  in 1977.  During his tenure, he introduced the Unemployment Allowance, Festival  Allowance for the State Employees, Prohibition of arrack and the steps initiated to revive the economy of Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://niyamasabha.org/codes/Chief%20Ministers%20Book%20Final.pdf |title= Chief Ministers, Ministers and Leaders of Opposition in Kerala: Biographical Sketches and other data |date= 26 February 2011 |publisher=[[Niyamasabha]] |accessdate=2011-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antony carried out [[Asian Development Bank]] aided "Modernization of Government Plan". He also liberalised education by allowing several private engineering and medical colleges to  open in Kerala and championed the state as an investment destination. He also ordered the closure of the Kerala Coca-Cola plant in 2004 citing drought and the non-availability of drinking water.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

V. Narasimha Rao]]. He resigned on moral grounds as food minister in 1994 when his ministry was involved in a sugar import scandal, despite there being no allegations against him.&lt;ref name="Antony appoint Cabinet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/politics/possible-successors-to-manmohan-singh_527957.html: No allegations against AK Antony in Sugar import scandal: Possible successors to Manmohan Singh] [[CNBC]] - 27 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Antony entered the Rajya Sabha and was inducted into the Union Council of Ministers as [[Defence Minister of India|Defence Minister]] following [[Natwar Singh]]'s expulsion from the Congress  and [[Pranab Mukherjee]]'s transfer to the Ministry of External Affairs. After the Congress again won the elections in 2009 and formed the government once again under [[Prime Minister]] [[Manmohan Singh]], Antony retained the portfolio of Defence for the second term becoming the longest-serving Defence Minister of India in a continuous stint for 8 years.&lt;ref name="Antony tenure Defence"&gt;{{cite web|title=AK Antony becomes the longest serving Defence Minister of India at a stretch|url=http://dailypioneer.com/nation/66396-antony-longest-at-helm-of-def-min-at-a-stretch.html|publisher=[[The Pioneer (Indian newspaper)]]|accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Antony longest Defence"&gt;{{cite web|title=AK Antony becomes the longest continuously serving Defence Minister|url=http://newindianexpress.com/nation/article525086.ece|publisher=[[The New Indian Express]]|accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His "Buy and Make Indian" campaign saw the cancellation of billion of dollars in purchases of foreign arms, while at the same time stunting domestic production by restricting investments. The result has been a "critical shortage of ammunition and gaping holes in its air defense systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140412/DEFREG03/304120016 |title=Procurement Problems Await Next Indian Government |last1=RAGHUVANSHI |first1=VIVEK |date=12 April 2014 |website=www.defensenews.com |publisher=Gannett Government Media |accessdate=2014-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other positions===
He held the post of Chairman of the [[Indian Statistical Institute]] in [[Kolkata]] (2012 to 2014), President of the [[Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses]] and [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of [[Defence Institute of Advanced Technology]] (2006 to 2014).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In the [[Second Council of Ministers of Manmohan Singh|Manmohan Singh Cabinet]], Antony was the senior member of the Cabinet Committees on Accommodation, Economic Affairs, Parliamentary Affairs, Political Affairs, and Security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cabsec.nic.in/files/allocation/cabinet_committees.pdf|title= Composition and Functions of the Federal Cabinet Committees (as on August 8, 2012) |date= 8 August 2012 |publisher=[[Cabinet Secretariat of India|Cabinet Secretariat]] |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is considered as political guru of [[Rahul Gandhi]].&lt;ref name=" Antony guru"&gt;{{cite web|title=I consider AK Antony as my guru, says Rahul Gandhi|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/i-consider-ak-antony-as-my-guru-says-rahul-gandhi/1/272561.html|publisher=[[India Today]]|accessdate=2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antony's political skills and long experience in government have also led him to heading a large number of committees of Ministers in the government, a device that has been employed to obtain consensus within the members of the governing coalition on contentious issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cabinet Secretariat, Government of India|url=http://cabsec.nic.in/|accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EGoM Role expansion"&gt;{{cite web|title=P Chidambaram, A K Antony &amp; Sharad Pawar get wider EGoM roles after Pranab Mukherjee's exit|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/p-chidambaram-a-k-antony-sharad-pawar-get-wider-egom-roles-after-pranab-mukherjees-exit/articleshow/15113545.cms|publisher=[[The Economic Times]]|accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Altai''' (also '''Gorno-Altai''') is a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language, spoken officially in the [[Altai Republic]], [[Russia]]. The language was called '''Oyrot''' (ойрот) prior to 1948.

==Classification==
Due to its isolated position in the [[Altai Mountains]] and contact with surrounding languages, the classification of Altai within the Turkic languages has often been disputed. Because of its geographic proximity to the [[Shor language|Shor]] and [[Khakas language]]s, some classifications place it in a Northern Turkic subgroup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=92721
|title = Ethnologue report for Northern Turkic
|accessdate = 2007-09-14
|editor = Gordon, Raymond G. Jr.
|year = 2005
|publisher = SIL International
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to certain similarities with [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], it has been grouped with the [[Kypchak languages]] which is within the Turkic language family. A more recent classification by Talat Tekin places Southern Altai in its own subgroup within Turkic and groups the Northern Altai dialects with Lower [[Chulym language|Chulym]] and the Kondoma dialect of [[Shor language|Shor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Tekin
 | first = Tâlat
 |date=January 1989
 | title = A New Classification of the Chuvash-Turkic Languages
 | journal = Erdem
 | volume = 5
 | issue = 13
 | pages = 129–139
 | issn = 1010-867X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical distribution==
Altai is spoken primarily in the [[Altai Republic]] (Southern Altai) and [[Altai Krai]] (Northern Altai).

===Official status===
Alongside [[Russian language|Russian]], Altai is an official language of the Altai Republic. The official language is based on the Southern dialect spoken by the group called the Altay-Kiži, however in the few years it has also spread to the Northern Altai Republic.

===Varieties===
Though traditionally considered one language, Southern Altai is not fully mutually intelligible with the Northern varieties. Written Altai is based on Southern Altai, and according to ''Ethnologue'' is rejected by Northern Altai children.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed. 2005. ''Ethnologue: Languages of the World''. 15th edition. Dallas: Summer Institute of Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a Cyrillic alphabet was created for the Kumandy variety of Northern Altai for use in [[Altai Krai]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indigenous.ru/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=215 В Алтайском крае издана азбука кумандинского языка. 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dialects are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Banana leaves''' have a wide range of applications because they are large, flexible, waterproof and decorative. They are used for cooking, wrapping and food-serving in a wide range of cuisines in tropical and subtropical areas. They are used for decorative and symbolic purposes in numerous [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ceremonies. In traditional homebuilding in tropical areas, roofs and fences are made with dry banana-leaf thatch.&lt;ref name=Molina&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bw8Ow1H_OocC&amp;pg=PA84 |title=Advancing banana and plantain R &amp; D in Asia and the Pacific |page=84 |author=Molina, A.B. |author2=Roa, V.N. |author3=Van den Bergh, I. |author4=Maghuyop, M.A. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212184856/https://books.google.com/books?id=Bw8Ow1H_OocC&amp;pg=PA84 |archivedate=2017-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Banana and [[palm leaves]] were historically the primary writing surfaces in many nations of South and Southeast Asia.

The dried leaves are called 'Vaazhai-ch- charugu' (வாழைச் சருகு) in Tamil. Some South Indian, Filipino and Khmer recipes use banana leaves as a wrapper for frying. The leaves are later removed. In Vietnamese cuisine, banana leaves are used to wrap foods such as ''[[cha-lua]]''.

==Worldwide cuisine by country==

===In Indian cuisine===
[[File:Lunch from Karnataka on a plantain leaf.jpg|thumb|right|Food served on a banana leaf in [[Karnataka]], [[India]].]]
[[South Indian cuisine]] is traditionally served on a banana leaf, especially in the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]],[[Telangana]],[[Tamil Nadu]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Kerala]] and in the Northern and Eastern parts of [[Sri Lanka]]. In these regions, it is customary to serve food on a banana leaf during festive occasions, and banana is often a part of the food served. In Maharashtra, on special occasions like [[Ganesh chaturthi]], people eat off banana leaves. The banana leaf is also used for wrapping fish, which can then be steamed.

In [[Bengali cuisine]], banana leaf is used to prepare Paturi, which is marinated and seasoned boneless fresh fish steamed and cooked inside a banana leaf and eaten on it. Commonly, [[Bhetki]] and [[Ilish]] are used in making Paturi.

===In Indonesian cuisine===
[[File:Chicken satay on banana leaf in Java.jpg|thumb|right|Chicken [[satay]] served in ''pincuk'', a banana leaf cone-shaped plate.]]
[[File:Wrapped lontong.jpg|thumb|Unwrapped lontong. Different colors depend on the banana leaf which is used as the wrapper.]]
In [[Indonesian cuisine]], banana leaf is employed in cooking methods called ''[[pepes]]'' and ''[[botok]]''; the banana-leaf packets of food are steamed, boiled, or grilled on charcoal. Banana leaves are also used to wrap several kinds of snacks ''[[kue]]'' (delicacies), such as ''[[nagasari]]'' or ''kue pisang'' and ''[[otak-otak]]'', and also to wrap pressed sticky-rice delicacies such as ''[[lemper]]'' and ''[[lontong]]''.

In Java, banana leaf is also used as a shallow conical bowl called ''"pincuk"'', usually to serve ''[[rujak]] tumbuk, [[pecel]]'' or [[satay]]. The ''pincuk'' secured with ''lidi semat'' (small thorn-like pins made from the coconut-leaf midrib). The ''pincuk'' fit in the left palm, while the right hand is used to consume the food. It also functions as a traditional disposable take-away food container. The cleaned banana leaf is often used as a placemat; cut banana-leaf sheets placed on rattan, bamboo or clay plates are used to serve food. Decorated and folded banana leaves on woven bamboo plates are used as serving trays, ''[[tumpeng]]'' rice cones, and holders for ''jajan pasar'' or ''[[kue]]'' delicacies.

===In Malaysian and Singaporean cuisine===
In [[Malaysian cuisine|Malaysian]] and [[Singapore cuisine]], banana leaves are used to wrap certain [[kuih]] and [[otak-otak]]. Malay foods such as [[nasi lemak]] are also commonly wrapped with banana leaves before being wrapped with newspaper, as banana leaves add fragrance to the rice.

===In Philippine cuisine===
[[File:Cassava Suman.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Suman (food)|Sumang kamoteng kahoy]]'' ([[cassava]] ''suman''), wrapped in banana leaves.]]
Banana leaves are the traditional method of serving food in [[Philippine cuisine]], with rice and other dishes laid out on large banana leaves (a ''salo-salo'', reminiscent of a [[buffet]]) and everyone partaking using their bare hands (''kamayan'').&lt;ref name="nol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/115686/have-filipino-food-will-travel/|title=Have Filipino food, will travel|author=Elizabeth Ann Quirino|date=16 December 2014|publisher=Inquirer|accessdate=6 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220233242/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/115686/have-filipino-food-will-travel/|archivedate=20 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/bites/archives/2014/12/11/authentic-filipino-food-comes-to-nashville-for-one-night-salo-project-pop-up|title=Authentic Filipino Food Comes to Nashville for One-Night SALO Project Pop-Up|author=Margaret Littman|publisher=Nola Defender|accessdate=6 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106081631/http://www.nashvillescene.com/bites/archives/2014/12/11/authentic-filipino-food-comes-to-nashville-for-one-night-salo-project-pop-up|archivedate=6 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another traditional method of serving food is by placing it on a banana-leaf liner placed over a woven ''bilao'' (a [[winnowing|winnowing basket]] made of bamboo).

==In tradition and religion==
[[File:Prasadam on banana leaves.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Prasad]]am'' offered on banana leaves after [[Puja (Hinduism)|''Puja'']] at a home in [[Guntur]], [[India]].]]
Banana leaves are used by Hindus and Buddhists as a decorative element for special functions, marriages, and ceremonies in southern [[India]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. [[Balinese Hinduism|Balinese Hindu]] prepared banana leaf as the container for floral offerings called ''[[Canang sari|canang]]'' dedicated for [[hyang]] (spirits or deities) and gods. These floral offerings were placed in various places around the house.

In [[Thailand]], banana leaf is used to create an offering bowl called ''krathong'', it is an important element during traditional festival of ''[[Loy Krathong]]'' day. Thai people will celebrate this on the full-moon day of the twelfth lunar month.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://magazine.culture.go.th/newbook/book/other/loy.pdf|title =ลอยกระทง|date =October 2014|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|author =Department of Cultural Promotion, Ministry of Culture|deadurl =no|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160304123846/http://magazine.culture.go.th/newbook/book/other/loy.pdf|archivedate =2016-03-04|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebration was meant to pay respect to the Mother of Water called ''Phra Mae Kong Kha'' by floating a ''krathong'' on a body of water.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sahavicha.com/?name=knowledge&amp;file=readknowledge&amp;id=3878|title = ภูมิปัญญาไทยกับงานใบตอง|date = 10 May 2011|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Seamlaem|first = S|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072434/http://www.sahavicha.com/?name=knowledge&amp;file=readknowledge&amp;id=3878|archivedate = 4 March 2016|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Asian countries also shares this similar festival such as; Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, India and China.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Krathong'' means lotus-shaped vessel like a leave bowl made of banana leaves and flowers with joss sticks and a candle in the middle. During Loy Krathong festival, people carry their ''krathongs'' to the river. After lighting candles and three joss sticks and making a wish, they will gently place their ''krathongs'' on the water and let them drift away.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; People believed that ''krathongs'' will carry their wickedness and bad luck away, and after that happiness will come to them. In fact, it is the time to be happy as the sufferings are floated away and a time to enjoy dancing, singing, or activities with other people. People use banana leaves to make ''krathongs'' because it is organic material, natural and would decompose easily.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==As a writing surface==
{{see also|Palm-leaf manuscript}}
Banana and palm leaves were historically the primary writing surface in many nations of South and Southeast Asia. This has influenced the evolution of their scripts. The rounded letters of many of the [[Brahmic scripts|scripts of southern India]] (such as [[Oriya script|Oriya]] and [[Sinhala script|Sinhala]]), of [[Burmese script|Burmese]], and of [[Javanese alphabet|Javanese]], for example, are thought to have been influenced by this: Sharp angles and tracing straight lines along the vein of the leaf with a sharp writing implement would risk splitting the leaf and ruining the surface, so rounded letters, or letters with straight lines only in the vertical or diagonal direction, were required for practical daily use.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford Steever, 'Tamil Writing', in Daniels &amp; Bright, ''The World's Writing Systems'', 1996, p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;

In such situations, the ribs of the leaves function as the dividing lines of [[ruled paper]], separating lines of text. It is believed that this was so influential in the development of the [[rongorongo]] script of Easter Island that the more elaborate wood tablets were fluted to imitate the surface of a banana leaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Barthel, Thomas S. |authorlink=Thomas Barthel |year=1971 |title=Pre-contact Writing in Oceania | series = [http://www.sign-lang.uni-hamburg.de/BibWeb/LiDat.acgi?ID=39343 Current Trends in Linguistics] |volume=8 |pages=1169 |location=Den Haag, Paris |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter|Mouton]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2441">The first biblical text in [[Ainu language]] appeared in 1887, when a tentative edition of 250 copies of Matthew 1-9, translated from the Greek with the aid of the Revised Version, by [[John Batchelor (missionary)|John Batchelor]], assisted by a local Ainu, was published.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J.

In 1891 Mr. Batchelor returned to England and published the remaining Gospels. In 1893 a tentative edition of 300 each of Galatians, Ephesians, and Philippians, by the same translator, was prepared, which was published at Yokohama by a joint committee of the three Bible Societies (British and Foreign, American, and National of Scotland) in 1894. The Psalms and revised Gospels were issued in 1895. In 1897 a revised New Testament, by the same translator, with Ainu aid, was published at Yokohama by the joint committee.&lt;ref&gt;George A. King, ''In Our Tongues; A Popular Handbook to the Translation Work of the British and Foreign Bible Society'' (General Books, 2010) page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8142">'''The Cambridge English Corpus''' (formerly the Cambridge International Corpus) is a multi-billion word corpus of [[English language]] (containing both [[text corpus]] and spoken corpus data). The Cambridge English Corpus (CEC) contains data from a number of sources including written and spoken, British and American English. The CEC also contains the Cambridge Learner Corpus, a 40m word corpus made up from English exam responses written by English language learners.

The Cambridge English Corpus is used to inform Cambridge University Press [[English Language Teaching]] publications as well as for research in [[corpus linguistics]]. Access is currently restricted to authors and researchers working on projects and publications for [[Cambridge University Press]], and researchers at [[Cambridge English Language Assessment]].&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge International Corpus, http://www.cambridge.org/us/esl/catalog/subject/custom/item3637700/Cambridge-International-Corpus-Cambridge-International-Corpus/?site_locale=en_US&lt;/ref&gt;

== Written Data ==
The Cambridge English Corpus contains instances of modern written English, taken from newspapers, magazines, novels, letters, emails, textbooks, websites, and many other sources.

== Spoken Data ==
The Cambridge English Corpus contains a wide variety of spoken English language, taken from many sources, including everyday conversations, telephone calls, radio broadcasts, presentations, speeches, meetings, TV programmes and lectures.

== Cambridge Learner Corpus ==
The Cambridge Learner Corpus (CLC) is a collection of exam scripts written by students learning English, built in collaboration with Cambridge English Language Assessment. The CLC contains scripts from over 180,000 students, from around 200 countries, speaking 138 different [[first language]]s and is growing all the time.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Learner Corpus, http://www.cambridge.org/us/esl/catalog/subject/custom/item3646603/Cambridge-International-Corpus-Cambridge-Learner-Corpus/?site_locale=en_US&lt;/ref&gt; The exams currently included are:

* KET [[Cambridge English: Key (KET)|Key English Test]] (and KET for schools)
* PET [[Preliminary English Test]] (and PET for schools)
* FCE [[First Certificate in English]]
* CAE [[Certificate in Advanced English]]
* CPE [[Certificate of Proficiency in English]]
* BEC [[Business English Certificate]] (all levels)
* IELTS [[International English Language Testing System]] (academic and general training)
* CELS Certificates in English Language Skills
* ILEC International Legal English Certificate
* ICFE International Certificate in Financial English
* Skills for Life

A unique feature of the Cambridge Learner Corpus is its error coding system. Language specialists identify and annotate errors in the exam scripts. This means that the Corpus can be used to find out about the frequency of different types of errors, the contexts that the errors are made in and the student groups that find particular language areas difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Nicholls, http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/publications/CL2003/papers/nicholls.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors of Cambridge [[English Language Teaching]] resources can use this information to target common errors – for example, the Cambridge Advanced Learner’s Dictionary contains ‘Common mistake’ features which highlight frequent learner errors.

Conversely, the error coding system also reveals what students can achieve at each level. This is central to the work of [[English Profile]], a collaborative programme to enhance the learning, teaching and assessment of English worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;English Profile project, http://www.englishprofile.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11&amp;Itemid=2&lt;/ref&gt; The founding partners are [[Cambridge University Press]], [[Cambridge English Language Assessment]], the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[University of Bedfordshire]], the [[British Council]] and English UK.&lt;ref&gt;English Profile, http://www.englishprofile.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=24&amp;Itemid=22&lt;/ref&gt; The project’s aim is to describe what learners know and can do in English at each level of the [[Common European Framework of Reference]] (CEFR).&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, CEFR levels,{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/CADRE_EN.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030205032/http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/CADRE_EN.asp |archivedate=2009-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specialized corpora ==
The Cambridge English Corpus contains a number of specialized corpora:

=== Cambridge Business English Corpus ===
The Cambridge Business English Corpus is a large collection of British and American business language, including reports and documents, books relating to different aspects of business, and the business sections from many national newspapers.

The Cambridge Business English Corpus also includes the '''Cambridge and Nottingham Spoken Business English Corpus''' (CANBEC), the result of a joint project between [[Cambridge University Press]] and the [[University of Nottingham]]. This is a collection of recordings of English from companies of all sizes, ranging from big multinational companies to small partnerships. It contains formal and informal meetings, presentations, telephone conversations, lunchtime conversations, and spoken language from other business situations.

=== Cambridge Legal English Corpus ===
The Cambridge Legal English Corpus contains books, journals and newspaper articles relating to the law and legal processes.

=== Cambridge Financial English Corpus ===
The Cambridge Financial English Corpus contains texts relating to economics and finance, including leading financial magazines and newspapers.

=== Cambridge Academic English Corpus ===
The Cambridge Academic English Corpus contains written and spoken academic language at undergraduate and post-graduate level from a range of US and UK institutions, including lectures, seminars, student presentations, journals, essays and text books.

=== CANCODE ===
The Cambridge and Nottingham Corpus of Discourse in English (CANCODE) is a collection of spoken English recorded at hundreds of locations across the British Isles in a wide variety of situations (e.g. casual conversation, socialising, finding out information, and discussions). The CANCODE corpus is the result of a joint project between [[Cambridge University Press]] and the [[University of Nottingham]].

There are about five million words in the CANCODE corpus, and it's a very rich resource for researchers of spoken English.  However, the data does have some limitations.  Most people knew they were being recorded, and are chatting in informal situations such as while relaxing at home, with others of fairly equal social status.  This means the interactions are generally consensual and collaborative, so the corpus has minimal evidence of conflict or adversarial exchanges&lt;ref&gt;Carter (2004) Language and Creativity: The Art of Common Talk. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cambridge-Cornell Corpus of Spoken North American English ===
The Cambridge University Press/Cornell Corpus is a large collection of informal, highly interactive, multiparty conversations between family/friends in North America. The Cambridge-Cornell corpus is the result of a joint project between [[Cambridge University Press]] and [[Cornell University]].

=== CAMSNAE ===
The Cambridge Corpus of Spoken North American English (CAMSNAE) is a large collection of spoken American English. It includes recordings of people going about their everyday life – at work, at home with their families, going shopping, having meals, etc.

'''Car''' is the most widely spoken of the [[Nicobarese languages]] spoken in the [[Nicobar Islands]] of [[India]].

Although related distantly to [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and [[Khmer language|Khmer]], it is typologically much more akin to nearby [[Austronesian languages]] such as [[Nias language|Nias]] and [[Acehnese language|Acehnese]], with which it forms a [[linguistic area]].&lt;ref&gt;Cysouw, Michael; [http://email.eva.mpg.de/~cysouw/pdf/cysouwDGFS2005.pdf Quantitative explorations of the world-wide distribution of rare characteristics, or: the exceptionality of north-western European languages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514195944/http://email.eva.mpg.de/~cysouw/pdf/cysouwDGFS2005.pdf |date=2009-05-14 }}; pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Spanish language}}

'''Colombian Spanish''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''español colombiano'' or ''castellano colombiano'') is a grouping of the varieties of Spanish spoken in [[Colombia]]. The term is of more geographical than linguistic relevance, since the dialects spoken in the various regions of Colombia are quite diverse. The speech of coastal areas tends to exhibit phonological innovations typical of [[Caribbean Spanish]], while highland varieties have been historically more conservative. The [[Caro and Cuervo Institute]] in [[Bogotá]] is the main institution in Colombia to promote the scholarly study of the language and literature of both Colombia and the rest of Spanish America. The educated speech of Bogotá, a generally conservative variety of Spanish, has high popular prestige among Spanish-speakers throughout the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lipski|1994|pp=205–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dialectos Colombia.png|thumb|Spanish Dialects in Colombia.]]

==Phonology==
{{contradiction|section|reason=One section says stops are not fricatized, the other says notates words as fricatized!|date=April 2017}}

*The phoneme {{IPA|/x/}} is realized as [[glottal consonant|glottal]] {{IPA|[h]}} "in all regions [of Colombia]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Canfield|1981|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in southern Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, the Caribbean coast of Venezuela, the Spanish-speaking islands of the Caribbean, the Canary Islands, and southern Spain as well as occasionally in Ecuador, Peru, Chile, and Argentina.
* As in most other American dialects, also, Colombian Spanish has ''[[yeísmo]]'' (the merger of {{IPAslink|ʎ}} into {{IPAslink|ʝ}}). The exception is the traditional speech of Santander and around Pasto (inland Nariño), where {{IPAblink|ʎ}} can still be heard. Until the 20th century, most Andean Colombian dialects maintained {{IPAslink|ʎ}}, including Bogotá (now, only some older speakers retain the traditional distinction).
* As in most of the Americas, the Canary Islands and most of Andalusia, Colombia has ''[[seseo]]'' (the lack of distinction between {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/s/}}), making ''cocer''/''coser'' or ''abrazar''/''abrasar'' homophones. Though ''seseo'' is general in Colombia and {{IPA|/s/}} is usually lamino-alveolar {{IPA|[s̻]}}, an apico-alveolar, Castilian-style /s/, {{IPA|[s̺]}}, made with the tip of the tongue against the alveolar ridge, is current in many Andean regions, especially in [[Antioquia Department]] ([[Medellín]]). That trait (unique in the Americas) is to be associated with a large number of northern Spanish settlers in Andean Colombia.
*The [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] consonants {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} are pronounced as [[stop consonants]] after and sometimes before any consonant, rather than the [[fricative consonant|fricative]] or [[approximant consonant|approximant]] that is characteristic of most other dialects: ''pardo'' {{IPA|[ˈpardo]}}, ''barba'' {{IPA|[ˈbarba]}}, ''algo'' {{IPA|[ˈalɡo]}}, ''peligro'' {{IPA|[peˈliɡɾo]}}, ''desde'' {{IPA|[ˈdezde]}} (dialectally {{IPA|[ˈdeɦde]}} or {{IPA|[ˈdedːe]}}, rather than the {{IPA|[ˈparðo]}}, {{IPA|[ˈbarβa]}}, {{IPA|[ˈalɣo]}}, {{IPA|[peˈliɣɾo]}}, {{IPA|[ˈdezðe]}} (dial. {{IPA|[ˈdeɦðe]}}, {{IPA|[ˈdɛɦðe]}} or {{IPA|[ˈdɛðːe]}}) of most other dialects. A notable exception is [[Nariño Department]]&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Canfield|1981|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most [[:es:Español costeño (Colombia)|''Costeño'' speech]] (Atlantic coastal dialects), which feature the soft, fricative realizations that are common in other dialects.

=== Vowels ===
As most other Spanish dialects, standard Colombian Spanish has five vowels: two high vowels ({{IPA|/[[Close front unrounded vowel|i]], [[Close back rounded vowel|u]]/}}), two mid vowels ({{IPA|/[[mid-front unrounded vowel|e]], [[mid-back rounded vowel|o]]/}}) and one open vowel ({{IPA|/[[open central unrounded vowel|a]]/}}). However, [[vowel shift]]s, [[vowel reduction|reductions]], and [[vowel breaking|breaking]] have taken place in many of Colombia's populous regions, particularly in [[Bogotá]] and the [[Paisa Region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lingref.com/cpp/wss/3/paper1523.pdf|title=Diphthongization of Mid/Low Vowel Sequences in Colombian Spanish|last=|first=|date=|website=Lingref.com|access-date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That means that in Colombian Spanish, there may also be an additional number of vowels, making it one of the most phonologically-rich varieties Spanish.

==Personal pronouns==
*Much of the population in Colombia, especially in Bogotá, is known for using ''usted'' (the second-person singular pronoun considered [[T–V distinction|formal]] in most varieties of Spanish) between friends, family members, and others whose relationship would indicate the use of ''tú'' or ''vos'' in most other dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ringer Uber|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lipski|1994|pp=213–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Characteristic regional usages of pronouns include ''[[voseo]]'' (using ''vos'', the familiar singular "you," rather than the ''tú'' of other dialects) in the [[Paisa Region]] and the [[Valle del Cauca Department]] and using of [[Spanish pronouns#The use of vusted and vuestra merced|''su merced'']] (literally "your grace") in [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] and [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] Departments. Voseo is nonstandard and is prohibited in schools, and its use is decreasing and occurs in informal conversations. In the Eastern Highlands, such as in Bogotá, ''voseo'' was common until the 19th century, when it began to decline.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/product/448526|title=Desarrollo sociolingüístico del voseo en la región andina de Colombia (1555–1976)|website=Degruyter.com|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The second-person plural pronoun ''vosotros'' and its corresponding verb forms (-''áis''/-''éis''), which are common in Spain, are, as in the rest of the Americas, considered [[archaism|archaic]] and so are restricted to ecclesiastical language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La personne grammaticale et la langue espagnole|
first=Jack |last= Schmidely|year= 1983|isbn=2902618476|publisher= Presses Universitares de France}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*There are marked differences in the use of subject personal pronouns (overt vs. null subjects) between the highlands and coast. The highland varieties have overall pronominal rates of approximately 22-26%. The coastal varieties have higher pronominal rates. For instance, the overall pronominal rate in Barranquilla is 34.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Subject Pronoun Expression in Spanish: A Cross-Dialect Perspective|last = Carvalho,|first = Ana M., Rafael Orozco, and Naomi Lapidus Shin, (eds.)|publisher = Georgetown University Press|year = 2015|isbn = 9781626161702|location = Washington, DC|pages = 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diminutives==

*In Colombian Spanish, the diminutive forms ''-ico'', ''-ica'', rather than the more conventional ''-ito'', ''-ita'', are often used in words whose stem ends with "t": ''gato'' ("cat") → ''gatico'' ("kitty"). That is often seen in [[Cuban Spanish|Cuban]], [[Venezuelan Spanish|Venezuelan]], and [[Costa Rican Spanish|Costa Rican]] Spanish as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lipski|1994|pp=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The diminutive form can be applied not only to [[nouns]], as above, but also to [[adjectives]], to [[verbs]]. In their [[gerundive]] form, for example, ''corriendo'' ("running") becomes ''corriendito'' ("scurrying"). In [[adverb]]s, for example, ''ahora'' ("now") becomes ''ahorita'' ("right now"). Even in [[preposition]]s, ''junto a'' ("next to") becomes ''juntico a'' ("right next to").
*Redundant diminutives are used in which the diminutive ending is applied to both the noun and the adjective in the same phrase: ''el chocolate caliente'' ("the hot cocoa") becomes ''el chocolatico calientico'' ("the nice little cup of hot chocolate").
*The emphatic diminutives are used in which two diminutive endings are applied to the same word to emphasize the sentence. For example, with ''ahora'' ("now"), ''Váyase ahora mismo'' ("Get out right now") becomes ''Váyase ahoritica mismo'' ("Get the heck out right now!"). Also, with ''bueno'' ("good"), ''El carro está bueno'' ("The car is in good condition") becomes ''El carro está buenecitico'' ("The car is in tip-top condition").

==Common expressions==
*Paradoxically, in intrafamily speech, it is common for husband and wife to address each other as ''mijo'' and ''mija'' (from ''mi hijo'' "my son" and ''mi hija'' "my daughter"), and sons and daughters are lovingly called ''papito'' ("daddy") and ''mamita'' ("mommy"). 
*A common greeting in Colombia is ''¿Quiubo?'' (sometimes written as ''qui'iubo'' or ''kiubo''), a contraction of the older, still-used greeting ''¿Qué Hubo?''. That phrase, used by younger generations, is usually contracted to ''¿Qu'iubo?'' (sometimes written as ''¿Kiubo?''). The phrase uses the [[preterite]] form of the verb ''haber'', whose present-tense form, ''hay'', means "there is" or "there are." Thus, ''¿Qué Hubo'' translates literally to "what was there?" or "what has there been?" It is used like "what's up?" in English. It originated in the Paisa dialect but has spread throughout Colombia, and it is considered throughout Latin America and the Spanish-speaking world to be a very stereotypical of Colombia. 

===Slang words===
Slang speech is frequent in popular culture. In the Paisa Region and Medellín, the local slang is named "Parlache."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://html.rincondelvago.com/parlache.html|title=Parlache|date=30 August 2004|work=rincondelvago.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many slang expressions have spread outside their original areas and are now commonly understood throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comunicaciones.udea.edu.co/|title=Antioquia University- Communications Portal|work=udea.edu.co}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the words have been popularized by the Colombian media, such as Alonso Salazar's book, ''No nacimos pa' semilla'',&lt;ref&gt;Alonso Salazar, ''No nacimos pa' semilla: La cultura de las bandas juveniles de Medellín'' (CINEP: 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Gaviria]]'s movie ''[[Rodrigo D: No Future]]'', or [[Andrés López Forero]]'s monologue ''La pelota de letras'' ("The Lettered Ball") as well as many other cultural expressions, including [[telenovela]]s, magazines, news coverage, jokes, etc..

==Dialects==
[[John M. Lipski]] groups Colombian dialects phonologically into four major zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lipski|1994|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canfield refers to five major linguistic regions.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Flórez proposes seven dialectal zones, based on phonetic and lexical criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Flórez|1964|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still others recognize eleven dialect areas, as listed below.

===Paisa dialect===
{{Main article|Paisa Region#Language|l1=Paisa dialect}}

The [[Paisa region|Paisa]] dialect is spoken in the [[Colombian coffee]] production areas, such as [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[Quindío]], [[Risaralda Department|Risaralda]] and [[Caldas Department|Caldas]]. Paisa Spanish has an [[apical consonant|apicoalveolar]] {{IPAblink|s̺}}, between {{IPAblink|s}} and {{IPAblink|ʃ}}, as in northern and central Spain.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Paisa Spanish, a "[[voseo|voseante]]" dialect, often uses ''vos'', rather than ''tú'', for the familiar singular "you" pronoun. The role of that [[voseo]] usage in forming the distinct Paisa linguistic identity was reinforced by its use in the works of several Paisa writers, including [[Tomás Carrasquilla]],&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; [[:es:Fernando González (escritor)|Fernando González Ochoa]], [[Manuel Mejía Vallejo]], [[Fernando Vallejo]], and [[Gonzalo Arango]].

===Rolo dialect===
"Rolo" (a name for the dialect of [[Bogotá]]) is also called ''cachaco''. It is an area of strong ''ustedeo'', the familiar use of the pronoun ''usted''. The dialect follows many patterns similar to those of the Cundiboyacense dialect&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lipski|1994|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; (preservation of syllable-final {{IPA|[s]}}, preservation of {{IPA|/d/}} in the ''-ado'' ending, preservation of the ''ll/y'' contrast (i.e., no ''[[yeísmo]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Canfield|1981|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Garrido|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it had ls only marginal use of the formal second-person pronoun ''sumercé''.

===Cundiboyacense dialect===
The Cundiboyacense dialect is spoken mainly in the departments of [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] and [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] ([[Altiplano Cundiboyacense|Cundiboyacense High Plateau]]). It uses the expression ''sumercé'' or ''su merced'' (literally "your grace") often as a formal second-person singular pronoun. The pronoun ''usted'' is used when two people speak in an informal situation. ''Tuteo'' (the use of the pronoun ''tú'') is usual in conversation between a man and woman of similar ages. Occasionally, the pronoun ''usted'' may be used briefly in extremely-informal speech between couples or family members or to reprehend someone, depending on the tone of voice.

===Caribbean dialect===
{{Main article|Caribbean Spanish}}

The Caribbean or Coastal (''costeño'', ''celador'') dialect is spoken in the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia]]. It shares many of the features typical of general [[Caribbean Spanish]] and is phonologically similar to [[Andalusian Spanish|Andalusian]] and [[Canarian Spanish]]. Word-final {{IPA|/n/}} is realized as [[Velar nasal|velar]] {{IPA|[ŋ]}}. Syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} is typically pronounced {{IPA|[h]}} and sk ''costa'' ("coast") is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈkohta]}} and ''rosales'' ("roses") becomes {{IPA|[roˈsaleh]}}. The most notable and distinguishable varieties of Atlantic- Colombian accents are Barranquilla (Considered the most l-articulated Spanish in America and mostly rhotic in upper-class speakers), Cartagena (Mostly non-rhotic and fast-spoken) and Montería (Sinú Valley Accent, strictly non-rhotic, plosive and very marked wording {{what|date=August 2018}} like [[Received Pronunciation]] in British English), and all varieties avoid using r.

====Island dialect====
This is the dialect spoken in the [[Islands]] of [[San Andrés, Providencia, and Santa Catalina]] in Colombia's [[Caribbean Region of Colombia|Caribbean Region]]. It is marked by a mixture of [[Caribbean Spanish]] with some features of [[English language|English]]. Syllable-final {{IPA|/r/}} can be realized, in addition to the [[Flap consonant|flap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}}, the [[Trill consonant|trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}, and the [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] [l], as the [[alveolar approximant]] {{IPAblink|ɹ}}, the last being thought to be an influence of [[British English]]. Thus, ''verso'' ("verse") becomes {{IPA|[ˈbeɹso]}} (alongside  {{IPA|[ˈbeɾso]}}, {{IPA|[ˈberso]}}, or {{IPA|[ˈbelso]}}); ''invierno'' ("winter") becomes {{IPA|[imˈbjeɹno]}} (alongside {{IPA|[imˈbjeɾno]}}, {{IPA|[imˈbjerno]}}, or {{IPA|[imˈbjelno]}}), and ''escarlata'' ("scarlet") becomes {{IPA|[ehkaɹˈlata]}} (alongside {{IPA|[ehkaɾˈlata]}}, {{IPA|[ehkarˈlata]}}, or {{IPA|[ehkaˈlata]}}).

Word-final {{IPA|/r/}}, when followed by a vowel-initial word, is usually realized as a tap, an approximant, or the lateral {{IPA|[l]}}, as in ''amo''{{IPA|[ɾ~ ɹ ~ l]}} ''eterno'' ("eternal love"). If it is when followed by a consonant or a pause, it may be realized as any of those sounds or as a trill or elided, as in ''amo''{{IPA|[r ~ ɾ ~ ɹ ~ l]}} ''paterno'' ("paternal love").

That phonetic characteristic is not exclusive to Colombians, whose ancestry is traced back to the Spanish period before the British invasion, under British territorial rule, and the recovery of Spanish control. It is also used by [[Raizal]]s, by whites of British descent, and by descendants of mainland Colombians. The dialect of native Spanish-speakers in the area is closer to the [[Nicaraguan Spanish|Nicaraguan dialect of the Caribbean coast]], reflecting the geographical location of the archipelago, off the coast of Nicaragua.

===Valluno dialect===
The Valluno dialect, or ''[[español vallecaucano]]'', is spoken in the valley of the [[Cauca River]] between the [[Cordillera Occidental, Colombia|Western]] and [[Cordillera Central, Colombia|Central]] [[cordillera]]s. In Cali, the capital of [[Valle del Cauca Department|Valle del Cauca]], there is strong use of ''[[voseo]]'' (the use of the pronoun ''vos'' instead of other dialects, which use ''tú''), with its characteristic verb forms.

The Valluno dialect has many words and phrases not used outside of the region. People commonly greet one another with the phrase "¿Q'hubo vé, bien o qué?". Also, it is common to be asked "¿Sí o no?" when assessing agreement to rhetorical statements. Thong sandals are referred to as ''chanclas'', and plastic bags (''bolsas'' elsewhere) are called ''chuspas''. As in other areas, a ''chocha'' is another crude word for "vagina," and ''chucha'' refers to an opossum.  A ''pachanguero'' is someone who dances or parties all night long.

Andrés Caicedo was the main writer to depict the vernacular usage of language accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/product/448526|title=Desarrollo sociolingüístico del voseo en la región andina de Colombia (1555–1976)|date=24 April 2015|website=Degruyter.com|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pastuso dialect===
{{Main article|Andean Spanish}}
The [[Pasto|Pastuso]] dialect is spoken in the southwest ll of the country. One feature is [[apical consonant|apicoalveolar]] {{IPA|[s̺]}}, between {{IPAblink|s}} and {{IPAblink|ʃ}}, as in northern and central Spain. However, unlike Paisa, speakers typically conserve the "ll"/"y" distinction (the dialect has no ''[[yeísmo]]''), and in some areas, the ''r'' is pronounced as a [[consonant voicing and devoicing|voiced]] [[apical consonant|apical]] [[sibilant]]. Contrary to the usual tendency in Spanish to weaken or relax the sounds {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} between vowels, Pastuso-speakers tend to tense those sounds with more emphasis than in other dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/thesaurus/pdf/33/TH_33_002_001_1.pdf|format=PDF|title=SOBRE ALGUNAS FORMAS DE PRONUNCIAR MUCHOS COLOMBIANOS EL ESPAÑOL DATOS Y PROBLEMAS|website=Cvc.cervantes.es|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opita dialect===
The Opita dialect is spoken mostly in the departments of [[Tolima Department|Tolima]] and [[Huila Department|Huila]], mostly in the central and southern parts of the [[Magdalena River Valley]]. It is said to show strong influence of indigenous languages and is noted for its slow tempo and unique intonation. As in most of the Americas, the dialect has ''[[yeísmo]]'' and ''[[seseo]]''. The dialect is traditionally characterised by the use of the second-person pronoun ''usted'' (or ''vusted'' in some rural areas) in formal circumstances but also in familiar ones (in which most other dialects would use ''tú'', see "ustedeo" above). However, ''tú'' is gaining ground with young people. The use of ''[[voseo]]'' is rare.

===Santanderean dialect===
Santanderean is spoken mostly in the northeastern part of the country in [[Santander Department|Santander]] and [[Norte de Santander Department|Norte de Santander]] Departments. There is a strong use of ''ustedeo'' in both informal and formal contexts.

===Eastern plains or Llanero dialect===
{{Main article|Llanero Spanish}}
Llanero covers a vast area of the country with a low [[population density]]. It is spoken in the eastern plains of the country from the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Cordillera Oriental]] (the eastern mountain range of the [[Andes]]). It has a characteristic influence of inland Colombian settlers.

===Chocó or Pacific dialect===
{{Main article|Equatorial Spanish|l1=Chocoano Spanish}}

This dialect extends beyond the [[Department of Chocó]] throughout the [[Pacific Region of Colombia|Pacific coast]] and is said to reflect African influence in terms of [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] and [[isochrony|rhythm]]. Characteristically, syllable-final /s/ is frequently either [[debuccalization|debuccalized]] and pronounced as {{IPA|[h]}} or omitted, as in the Caribbean dialect (see above). Like the Caribbean dialect, word-final {{IPA|/n/}} is realized as [[velar nasal|velar]] {{IPA|[ŋ]}}, /d/ is replaced by /r/ in some words, and syllable-final {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} are often merged, as in [[Caribbean Spanish]].  This dialect is also spoken by Afro-Colombians living inland in the departments of [[Cauca Department|Cauca]] and [[Valle del Cauca Department|Valle del Cauca]].

In a study called ''Culturomics 2.0'', Kalev H. Leetaru examined news archives including print and [[broadcast media]] (television and radio transcripts) for words that imparted tone or "mood" as well as geographic data.&lt;ref name="leetaru"&gt;{{cite journal | first=Kalev H. | last=Leetaru | url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3663/3040 | title=Culturomics 2.0: Forecasting Large-Scale Human Behavior Using Global News Media Tone In Time And Space | journal=[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]] | volume=16 | issue=9 | date=5 September 2011 | doi=10.5210/fm.v16i9.3663}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quick"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/culturomics-using-media-coverage/19749/ |title=Culturomics research uses quarter-century of media coverage to forecast human behavior |first=Darren|last=Quick |date=7 September 2011 |work= |publisher=Gizmag.com |accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research was able to retroactively [[prediction|predict]] the 2011 [[Arab Spring]] and successfully estimate the final location of [[Osama Bin Laden]] to within {{convert|124|miles|km}}.&lt;ref name="leetaru" /&gt;&lt;ref name="quick" /&gt;

In a 2012 paper by Alexander M. Petersen and co-authors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Statistical Laws Governing Fluctuations in Word Use from Word Birth to Word Death | first=Alexander M. |last=Petersen | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | date=15 March 2012 | volume=2 |doi=10.1038/srep00313 |url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2012/120315/srep00313/full/srep00313.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; they found a "dramatic shift in the birth rate and death rates of words":&lt;ref name="shea" /&gt; Deaths have increased and births have slowed. The authors also identified a universal "tipping point" in the life cycle of new words at about 30 to 50 years after their origin, they either enter the long-term [[lexicon]] or fall into disuse.&lt;ref name="shea"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304459804577285610212146258 "The New Science of the Birth and Death of Words "], CHRISTOPHER SHEA, ''Wall Street Journal'', March 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 paper by [[Steffen Roth]], culturomic analyses is used to trace the [[decline of religion]], the rise of politics, and the relevance of the economy to modern societies, with one of the major results being that modern societies do not appear to be [[capitalist]] or economized.&lt;ref name="Roth 2014"&gt;Roth, S. (2014), "Fashionable functions. A Google ngram view of trends in functional differentiation (1800-2000)", ''International Journal of Technology and Human Interaction'', Band 10, Nr. 2, S. 34-58 (online: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2491422).&lt;/ref&gt; This paper is likely to be the first application of culturomics in sociology.

Culturomic approaches have been taken in the analysis of newspaper content in a number of studies by I. Flaounas and co-authors. These studies showed macroscopic trends across different news outlets and countries.  In 2012, a study of 2.5 million articles suggested that [[gender bias]] in [[news coverage]] depends on topic and how the readability of newspaper articles is related to topic.&lt;ref&gt;I. Flaounas, O. Ali, T. Lansdall-Welfare, T. De Bie, N. Mosdell, J. Lewis, N. Cristianini, RESEARCH METHODS IN THE AGE OF DIGITAL JOURNALISM, Digital Journalism, Routledge, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A separate study by the same researchers, covering 1.3 million articles from 27 countries,&lt;ref&gt;I. Flaounas, M. Turchi, O. Ali, N. Fyson, T. De Bie, N. Mosdell, J. Lewis, N. Cristianini, The Structure of EU Mediasphere, PLoS ONE, Vol. 5(12), pp. e14243, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; showed macroscopic patterns in the choice of stories to cover. In particular, countries made similar choices when they were related by economic, geographical and cultural links. The cultural links were revealed by the similarity in voting for the [[Eurovision song contest]]. This study was performed on a vast scale, by using [[statistical machine translation]], [[text categorisation]] and [[information extraction]] techniques.

The possibility to detect [[public opinion|mood shifts in a vast population]] by analysing [[Twitter]] content was demonstrated in a study by T. Lansdall-Welfare and co-authors.&lt;ref&gt;Effects of the Recession on Public Mood in the UK; T Lansdall-Welfare, V Lampos, N Cristianini; Mining Social Network Dynamics (MSND) session on Social Media Applications&lt;/ref&gt; The study considered 84 million tweets generated by more than 9.8 million users from the United Kingdom over a period of 31 months, showing how public sentiment in the UK has changed with the announcement of spending cuts.

In a 2013 study by S Sudhahar and co-authors, the automatic parsing of textual corpora has enabled the extraction of actors and their relational networks on a vast scale, turning textual data into network data.  The resulting networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analysed by using tools from Network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as robustness or structural stability of the overall network, or centrality of certain nodes.&lt;ref&gt;Network analysis of narrative content in large corpora; S Sudhahar, G De Fazio, R Franzosi, N Cristianini; Natural Language Engineering, 1-32, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 study by T Lansdall-Welfare and co-authors, 5 million news articles were collected over 5 years&lt;ref&gt;Lansdall-Welfare T, Sudhahar S, Veltri GA, Cristianini N. On the Coverage of Science in the Media: A Big Data Study on the Impact of the Fukushima Disaster. In Big Data (Big Data), 2014 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, New York. 2014. p. 60-66.&lt;/ref&gt; and then analyzed to suggest a significant shift in sentiment relative to coverage of nuclear power, corresponding with the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|disaster of Fukushima]]. The study also extracted concepts that were associated with nuclear power before and after the disaster, explaining the change in sentiment with a change in narrative framing.

In 2015, a study revealed the bias of the Google books data set, which  "suffers from a number of limitations which make it an obscure mask of cultural popularity,"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and calls into question the significance of many of the earlier results.

Culturomic approaches can also contribute towards conservation science through a better understanding of human-nature relationships. In 2016, a publication by Richard Ladle and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Ladle, R. J., Correia, R. A., Do, Y., Joo, G. J., Malhado, A. C. M., Proulx, R., . . . Jepson, P. (2016). Conservation culturomics. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 14(5), 270-276. doi:10.1002/fee.1260&lt;/ref&gt; highlighted five key areas where culturomics can be used to advance the practice and science of conservation, including recognizing conservation-oriented constituencies and demonstrating public interest in nature, identifying conservation emblems, providing new metrics and tools for near-real-time environmental monitoring and to support conservation decision making, assessing the cultural impact of conservation interventions, and framing conservation issues and promoting public understanding. 

In 2017, a study correlated [[Arthralgia|joint pain]] with Google search activity and temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Telfer|first=Scott|last2=Obradovich|first2=Nick|date=2017-08-09|title=Local weather is associated with rates of online searches for musculoskeletal pain symptoms|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181266|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=12|issue=8|pages=e0181266|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0181266|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the study observed higher search activity for hip and knee pain (but not [[arthritis]]) during higher temperatures, it does not (and cannot) control for relevant other factors such as activity. Mass media misinterpreted this as "myth busted: rain does not increase joint pain",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/does-rain-increase-joint-pain-google-says-no-n791226|title=Are achy joints associated with rain?

==Criticism==

[[Linguist]]s and [[lexicographer]]s have expressed skepticism regarding the methods and results of some of these studies, including one by Petersen et al.,&lt;ref name=zimmer&gt;[http://bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/02/10/when-physicists-linguistics/ZoHNxhE6uunmM7976nWsRP/story.html "When physicists do linguistics"], BEN ZIMMER, ''Boston Globe'', February 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; while other have demonstrated bias in the Ngram data set, and their results "call into question the vast majority of existing claims drawn from the Google Books corpus,"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and "instead of speaking about general linguistic or cultural change, it seems to be preferable to explicitly restrict the results to linguistic or cultural change ‘as it is represented in the Google Ngram data’"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; because it is unclear what caused the observed change in the sample.

{{LGBT rights}}
The '''Declaration of Montreal on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Human Rights''' is a document adopted in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada, on July 29, 2006, by the [[2006 World Outgames#International Conference on LGBT Human Rights|International Conference on LGBT Human Rights]] which formed part of the [[2006 World Outgames|first World Outgames]]. The Declaration outlines a number of rights and freedoms pertaining to [[LGBT and intersex]] people that it is proposed be universally guaranteed. It encompasses all aspects of human rights, from the guarantee of fundamental freedoms to the prevention of discrimination against LGBT people in [[healthcare]], [[right to education|education]] and [[immigration]]. The Declaration also addresses various issues that impinge on the global promotion of [[LGBT rights]] and [[intersex human rights]]. Intended as a starting point in listing the demands of the international [[LGBT social movements|LGBT movement]], it will ultimately be submitted to the [[United Nations]].

==Background==
The Conference aimed to raise the [[international community]]'s awareness of [[LGBT rights]] issues. It was held immediately prior to the Outgames themselves and attended by almost 2000 delegates and 600 conference speakers from across the world, making it the largest LGBT rights conference ever held&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vallée|first=Pierre|date=2006-07-15|title=La Conférence veut laisser son empreinte: La Déclaration de Montréal fera état des griefs et revendications de la communauté internationale des LGBT|url=http://collections.banq.qc.ca/ark:/52327/2808847|journal=Le devoir, 1910- (Montréal)|volume=|issue=Cahier F|pages=F6|via=BAnQ Numérique}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A number of international experts took part including distinguished [[jurist]]s, academics, church leaders and [[human rights]] activists. The delegates unanimously approved the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2006-08-08 |title=Gay Games Montreal seen as 1st Class World Success |publisher=A2Mediagroup.com |url=http://www.a2mediagroup.com/?c=126&amp;a=8965 |accessdate=2007-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration aims to address UN failings in consistently applying its [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2006-07-28 |title=L'ONU interpellée |publisher=Radio-Canada |url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/regions/Montreal/2006/07/28/001-Declaration-Montreal.shtml |accessdate=2007-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of fundamental freedoms, including the [[right to life]], are violated in a number of member countries where [[homosexuality]] is criminalised. Homosexual acts are [[death penalty|punishable by death]] in nine jurisdictions:&lt;ref name="1a"&gt;Declaration of Montreal, 1. (a)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]], [[Nigeria]], [[Mauritania]], [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]] and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2000-07-31 |title=The Death Penalty for Homosexual Acts |publisher=[[ILGA]] |url=http://www.ilga.info/Information/Legal_survey/Summary%20information/death_penalty_for_homosexual_act.htm |accessdate=2007-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301150056/http://www.ilga.info/Information/Legal_survey/Summary%20information/death_penalty_for_homosexual_act.htm |archivedate=2007-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They remain illegal in 72 countries,&lt;ref name="1c"&gt;Declaration of Montreal, 1. (c)&lt;/ref&gt; and are in many cases punishable by imprisonment or [[corporal punishment]].

==Essential rights==
The Convention identifies several areas in which action needs to be taken to uphold the essential rights of [[LGBT]] people: "A world where LGBT rights are systematically violated, is a world where nobody can feel safe and free" referring to the principle of [[World Conference on Human Rights]] held in [[Vienna]] affirming that "All [[human rights]] are universal, indivisible, and interdependent and interrelated."&lt;ref name = "2."&gt;Declaration of Montreal, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protection against state and private violence===
The declaration calls for an end to the death penalty and all [[violence against LGBT people]] whether state condoned or by private parties. States are required to take steps to protect LGBT people from all [[hate crimes]]. Forced marriages to persons of the opposite sex are identified as particular human rights violations to be combated.

Finally, violence against [[intersex]] people, in particular unnecessary surgery to force conformity to rigid models of sexual characteristics, is condemned as well as genital surgery to them unless they are old enough to understand it and consent to it.&lt;ref name="1a"/&gt; This gave influence to Principle 18 (protection from medical abuse) of [[The Yogyakarta Principles]].

===Freedom of expression, assembly and association===
Laws which discriminate against LGBT people, such as bans of [[Gay pride|pride marches]], LGBT journalism and registration of non-governmental organisations, are identified as a major stumbling blocks in campaigning for LGBT rights issues. The world community is therefore called upon to guarantee such rights and prevent their being denied by hostile public authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Declaration of Montreal, 1. (b)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the international community is asked to take positive steps in promoting such rights. To this end, the Declaration calls for international [[development aid]] packages to be conditional on improvements in respecting human rights, including those of LGBT people. Financial aid is sought for groups campaigning for LGBT rights in areas where such people still fear for their lives or personal safety.&lt;ref name="1c"/&gt;

===Freedom to engage in consensual same-sex sexual activity===
The repeal of all laws preventing consensual same-sex activity is called for.&lt;ref name="1c"/&gt;

==Freedom from discrimination==
LGBT people face [[discrimination]] in many aspects of their lives. Governments are called upon to take positive actions to promote LGBT rights to freedom from discrimination in the following areas:

===Asylum and immigration rights===
The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] recognises a [[right to asylum]] for those fleeing persecution based on [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]]. All countries are called upon to do the same. In addition, rights of residence for foreign partners are demanded to be free from discrimination against LGBT people.&lt;ref name="2."/&gt;

===Family rights===
Families are stated to be the most important part of many people's lives. The Declaration requires marriages to be opened up to [[same-sex marriage|same-sex couples]], all unmarried couples to have similar partnership rights and ensuring equal access for all to every option for parenthood, including [[LGBT adoption|adoptions by LGBT people]].&lt;ref name="4b"&gt;Declaration of Montreal, 4. (b)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education healthcare, media and employment===
In education, classes on LGBT human rights are sought and schools are required to take action against [[Homophobia|homophobic]] bullying. The media are called upon to assist in breaking down [[LGBT stereotypes|stereotypes]] and to portray LGBT people in a realistic manner. The necessity of access to [[health care]] in general and for the specific needs of LGBT people is stressed. In particular funding for [[sex reassignment surgery]] is expected to be provided to the same extent that it is for other medically necessary treatments. Finally, religious groups are encouraged to be tolerant towards LGBT people.&lt;ref name="4b"/&gt;

===Employment===
The Declaration calls for the development of programmes to promote fair chances in employment and business for LGBT people in order for their economic independence and [[self-esteem]] to be insured. Governments are asked to lead by example in eliminating such [[workplace discrimination|discrimination]] and in promoting the equality and safety of LGBT people in [[public sector]] workplaces and [[trade union]]s.&lt;ref name="4b"/&gt;

==Global issues in promoting LGBT rights==
In order to promote LGBT rights globally, the Declaration requires the international community to engage in a worldwide information campaign and calls upon like-minded [[NGO]]s and governments to assist in preparing and running such a campaign. Part of this campaign would be to provide education about the prevention and treatment of [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] among LGBT people and governments are generally encouraged to include LGBT people in their fight against HIV and AIDS.&lt;ref name="2."/&gt;

The failure of the United Nations to recognise LGBT rights as human rights is condemned, despite the case law "''[[Toonen v. Australia]]''" by [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]].&lt;ref name="1c"/&gt; It is requested that the new [[UN Human Rights Council]] adopt LGBT rights as part of its agenda and that the [[ILGA|International Gay and Lesbian Association]] and other LGBT rights organisations be amongst the NGOs that are able to consult with the Council.&lt;ref name="2."/&gt; And at last, the Declaration calls on all nations in the world and United Nations to recognize an promote the 17 May of each year as the [[International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia]].&lt;ref&gt;Declaration of Montreal, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==

The [[Montreal borough]] of [[Ville-Marie (Montreal)|Ville-Marie]] was the first elected body in the world to officially adopt the Declaration in on August 1, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2006-08-02 |title=Declaration of Montreal endorsed by Ville-Marie Borough! |url=http://fugues.vortex.qc.ca/main.cfm?p=100&amp;Article_ID=7693 |publisher=fugues.com |accessdate=2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] became the first political party to do so, by a unanimous vote of its federal convention on September 10, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2006-09-11 |title=NDP formally adopts Declaration of Montreal on LGBT rights |url=http://action.web.ca/home/billsiksay/en_alerts.shtml?x=91453&amp;AA_EX_Session=6516a5a60989fd16da16f9870319236f |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311141126/http://action.web.ca/home/billsiksay/en_alerts.shtml?x=91453&amp;AA_EX_Session=6516a5a60989fd16da16f9870319236f |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-03-11 |publisher=billsiksay.ca |accessdate=2007-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the NDP's critic for LGBT rights, [[Bill Siksay]], presented a motion in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] calling on the Canadian government to abide by the Declaration on September 20, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2006-09-21 |title=Siksay calls for LGBT rights to be adopted |publisher=New Democratic Party |url=https://www.ndp.ca/page/4355 |accessdate=2007-01-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118152529/http://www.ndp.ca/page/4355 |archivedate=2007-01-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration has also been adopted by the [[City council|City Councils]] of:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2006-12-08 |title=Declaration of Montreal – Support, endorsements etc. |publisher=Declaration of Montreal website |url=http://www.declarationofmontreal.org/support.html |accessdate=2007-01-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218145433/http://www.declarationofmontreal.org/support.html |archivedate=2007-02-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23971">In the field of [[dialectology]], a '''diasystem''' or '''polylectal grammar'''{{efn|Although referentially synonymous, each term can carry different theoretical assumptions; {{Harvcoltxt|Wolfram|1982|p=3}} also lists ''overall pattern''}} is a linguistic analysis set up to encode or represent a range of related{{efn|Some scholars use "related" in a far broader sense than others. For example, {{Harvcoltxt|De Schutter|2010|p=73}} applies ''diasystem'' to "the complete set of varieties (diachronic as well as diatopic-synchronic) supposed to derive from one ancestor."}} [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] in a way that displays their structural differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Trask|1996|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Crystal|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''diasystem'' was coined by linguist and dialectologist [[Uriel Weinreich]] in a 1954 paper as part of an initiative in exploring how to extend advances in [[structural linguistics|structuralist]] [[linguistics|linguistic]] theory to dialectology to explain [[Variation (linguistics)|linguistic variation]] across dialects. Weinreich's paper inspired research in the late 1950s to test the proposal. However, the investigations soon showed it to be generally untenable, at least under structuralist theory. With the advent of [[generative grammar|generative]] theory in the 1960s, researchers tried applying a generative approach in developing diasystemic explanations; this also fell short.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|loc=section 3.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Auer|Di Luzio|1988|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some leading [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguists]],&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=44}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Auer|Di Luzio|1988|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the diasystem idea for incorporating variation into linguistic theory has been superseded by [[William Labov]]'s notion of the [[linguistic variable]]. As such, the concept has not been part of any substantial linguistic theory and the term has limited currency in linguistics.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Origin of the concept==
{{Harvcoltxt|Trubetzkoy|1931}} first suggested comparing accents by their synchronic states, rather than by comparing their different historical developments.{{Sfn|Wells|1982|p=72-73}}{{Sfn|Petyt|1980|p=117}} He classified sound differences between dialects into three types:{{Sfn|Trubetzkoy|1931|p=228}}
*'''Phonological''': the inventory phonemes and [[Phonotactics|contextual restrictions]], which may vary between dialects.  For example, speakers of Castilian Spanish have the phonemes {{IPAslink|θ}} and {{IPAslink|s}}, whereas most Western Hemisphere dialects of Spanish have just the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Martínez-Celdrán|Fernández-Planas|Carrera-Sabaté|2003|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Phonetic''': how phonemes are realized phonetically.  For example, most dialects of English have strongly [[Aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated]] {{IPA|/p t k/}} in words like ''park'', ''tool'', and ''cat'', but some [[Northern England English|Northern English]] accents do not feature such aspiration.{{Sfn|Wells|1970|p=247}}
*'''Etymological distribution''':{{efn|Starting with Kurath, other scholars have used the term ''incidence'' for this.{{Sfn|Pulgram|1964|p=70}}{{Sfn|Petyt|1980|p=122}}{{Sfn|Francis|1983|p=34}}}} the distribution of phonemes among member words in an interdialectal lexical correspondence set.  For example, most English varieties contrast {{IPA|/æ/}} and {{IPA|/ɑː/}}, but some use the former in words like ''bath'' and ''grass'' and others use the latter.{{Sfn|Wells|1982|p=79}}

Despite Trubetzkoy's proposal, linguists continued to consider variation between varieties outside of the scope of inquiry of grammar construction; each variety, in their thinking, should only be studied on its own terms.

Inspired by Trubetzkoy, {{Harvcoltxt|Weinreich|1954}} proposed a synthesis of linguistic geography and descriptive linguistics by applying the structuralist concept of grammar to the description of regular correspondences between different varieties;&lt;ref&gt;Weinreich also proposed the use of ''variety'' to replace ''dialect'' as it was commonly used at the time {{Harvcoltxt|Cadora|1976|p=404}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a resulting supergrammar, which he called a ''diasystem'', would  be consistent with the individual grammars of all the member dialects.{{Sfn|Weinreich|1954|pp=389–390}} A diasystem is a higher order system and its component units of analysis would accordingly be abstractions of a higher order than the units of analysis of the individual systems. That is, just as the phones present within an individual variety are grouped together into abstract [[phoneme]]s, the phonemes present within a group of varieties could be grouped together into even more abstract [[diaphoneme]]s.  Weinreich exemplified the diasystemic approach by a formulaic arrangement of phoneme correspondences in three dialects of [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], focusing on the vowels but arguing that the principle could work for other aspects of language.

Although Weinreich did not elaborate the diasystemic approach, he did consider some theoretical pitfalls to be avoided. He recognized that phonemic mergers and splits with dissimilar results across dialects would pose a difficult challenge for the construction of a diasystem; he cautioned against positing a diasystem when the work of creating all the member systems (e.g. the work of phonemicization) was yet incomplete; and, following the lead of {{Harvcoltxt|Trubetzkoy|1931}}, he noted that the differences in phonological inventory and etymological distribution might prove problematic in the construction of diasystems.

==Subsequent investigation==
A few linguists&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Trudgill|1974|p=134}} mentions {{Harvcoltxt|Cochrane|1959}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Moulton|1960}}, as well as {{Harvcoltxt|Pulgram|1964}}, {{Harvcoltxt|King|1969}}{{incomplete citation|date=March 2012}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Kurath|1969}}{{incomplete citation|date=March 2012}}, and his own dissertation of 1971, which was the basis of {{Harvcoltxt|Trudgill|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; took up Weinreich's challenge&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pulgram|1964|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|{{Harvcoltxt|Francis|1983|pp=165–166}} quotes extensively from {{Harvcoltxt|Francescato|1965a}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Francescato|1965b}}.}} and quickly found it to be inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Francis|1983|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the failures had been anticipated by Weinreich himself, as described above.

{{Harvcoltxt|Moulton|1960}} found an extreme example of divergent incidence in a study of two dialects of [[Swiss German]], Luzerner and Appenzeller, which evolved independently of each other. Although each dialect had the same set of eleven short vowel phonemes, only one pair ({{IPA|/i/}} ~ {{IPA|/i/}}) was shown to have a common parent vowel in earlier stages of German. The remaining phonetic similarities between the Luzerner and Appenzeller phoneme sets were fortuitous results of multiple mergers and splits that each dialect underwent separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Francis|1983|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harvcoltxt|Pulgram|1964}}, examining {{Harvcoltxt|Cochrane|1959}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Moulton|1960}}, noted the need for refinements in the original proposal; different researchers did not seem to agree on definitions, disciplines of study, or objects of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;For extensive theoretical discussion of the implications of Cochrane and Moulton on the original diasystem idea, see {{Harvcoltxt|Pulgram|1964}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Francis|1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The research and debate concluded that multiple dialects could not be described by a common grammar, at least not under structuralist theory.  That is, it would be unfeasible to construct a single grammar for multiple dialects unless their differences were very minor or if it incorporated only a small number of dialects.

Related to Weinreich's proposal were efforts in both American dialectology and [[generative phonology]] to construct an "overall system" that represented the underlying representation for all dialects of English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1977|p=169,226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvcoltxt|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=44}} for a list of major papers in the generativist stream through 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this was the [[diaphoneme|diaphonemic]] analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|McDavid|1952|p=383}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Weinreich argued that {{Harvcoltxt|Trager|Smith|1951}} fell short in constructing an accurate diasystem because the relevant component phonemic systems had not been established yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Weinreich|1954|p=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, {{Harvcoltxt|Stockwell|1959|pp=265–6}}, argues that their analysis is not truly diaphonemic because it includes oppositions without considering the effects of phonetic context.}} made by {{Harvcoltxt|Trager|Smith|1951}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1977|p=224}} points to earlier works by these authors as approaching the same goal but in less detail&lt;/ref&gt; that presumably all American varieties could fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Trager|Smith|1951|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six of the nine simple vowels in this diasystem are common across most dialects: {{IPA|/i/}} occurs in ''pit'', {{IPA|/e/}} in ''pet'', {{IPA|/æ/}} in ''pat'', {{IPA|/ə/}} in ''putt'', {{IPA|/u/}} in ''put'', and {{IPA|/a/}} in ''pot''. The other three are found in specific dialects or dialect groups: {{IPA|/o/}} represents the vowel of ''road'' in [[New England English|New England varieties]]; {{IPA|/ɨ/}} represents a vowel that often appears in stressed syllables in words like ''just'' (when it means 'only'); and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} represents the vowel of ''pot'' in Southern British and New England dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|McDavid|1952|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These nine simple vowels can then be combined with any of three offglides ({{IPA|/j h w/}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Whorf|1943}} proposed that centering diphthongs and vowel length were contextual variants of syllable-final {{IPA|/r/}} rather than {{IPA|/h/}} {{Harvcol|Swadesh|1947|p=146}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) to make 36 possible complex nuclei. This system was popular amongst American linguists (despite criticism, particularly from [[Hans Kurath]]&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Kurath|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;) until {{Harvcoltxt|Sledd|1966}} demonstrated its inadequacy.&lt;ref&gt;cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Allen|1977|pp=224–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most salient criticism of these broad diasystems was the issue of how [[diaphoneme#Cognitive reality|cognitively real]] they are.  That is, whether speakers actually have competence in using or understanding the grammatical nuances of multiple varieties.  In certain sociolinguistic circumstances, speakers' linguistic repertoire contains multiple varieties.{{Sfn|Wells|1982|p=72}} For example, {{Harvcoltxt|Cadora|1970|p=15}} argues that [[Modern Literary Arabic]] is a diasystem of various interference phenomena occurring when speakers of different [[varieties of Arabic|Arabic varieties]] attempt to speak or read [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]].

More concretely, [[Peter Trudgill]] put forth what he considered to be a cognitively real&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Trudgill|1974|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; diasystem in {{Harvcoltxt|Trudgill|1974}}, a book-length sociolinguistic study of [[Norwich]].  As a critic of Weinreich's original proposal, he approached the concept as a generativist, putting forth a series of rules that could generate any possible output reflected in the diversity and variability of sociologically conditioned linguistic variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1975|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because most speakers of Norwich could vary their pronunciation of each variable depending on the circumstances in which they are speaking, the diasystem's rules reflected speakers' actual linguistic abilities.

Cognitively real diasystems are not limited to humans.  For example, [[crow]]s are able to distinguish between different calls that prompt others to disperse, assemble, or rescue; these calls show regional variation so that French crows do not understand recorded American calls. Although captive birds show difficulty understanding the calls of birds from nearby regions, those allowed to migrate are able to understand calls from both, suggesting that they have mentally constructed a diasystem that enables them to understand both call systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Frings|Frings|1959}}, cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Sebeok|1963|p=456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, these sorts of "idiosyncratic" grammars differ in degree from broader diasystems, which are much less likely to be part of speakers' linguistic competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ballard|1971|p=267}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Bailey|1972|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even Trudgill has argued against their cognitive reality, deeming the concept of a broad diasystem to be a "theoretical dead-end."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Trudgill|1983}}, chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the concept did not withstand scrutiny by research linguists, it nevertheless triggered a surge of academic work that used it in applied linguistics (e.g. for [[English as a foreign or second language|ESL]] education materials, composition texts for native speakers, basic linguistics texts, and in the application of linguistics to literary criticism).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Stockwell|1959|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diasystemic representations are also possible in dictionaries. For example, the [[Macquarie Dictionary]] reflects the pronunciation of four phonetically distinct sociolects of [[Australian English]]. Because these sociolects are the same phonemically, readers (at least, those from Australia) can interpret the system as representing their own accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Algeo|1988|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''digerati''' (or '''digirati''') are the elite of [[digitalization]], [[social media]], [[content marketing]], [[computer industry]] and [[online]] communities. The word is a [[portmanteau]], derived from "[[Digital data|digital]]" and "[[wikt:literati|literati]]", and reminiscent of the earlier coinage ''glitterati'' (glitter and literati). Famous [[computer science|computer scientists]], [[Technology|tech]] magazine writers, digital consultants with multi-year experiences and well-known bloggers are included among the digerati.

The word is used in several related but different ways. It can mean:

*Opinion leaders who, through their writings, promoted a vision of digital technology and the Internet as a transformational element in society;
*People regarded as celebrities within the [[Silicon Valley]] computer [[subculture]], particularly during the [[dot-com boom]] years;
*Anyone regarded as influential within the digital technology community.

==Term history==

The first mention of the word ''Digerati'' on [[USENET]] occurred in 1992 by [[Arthur Wang]], and referred to an article by [[George Gilder]] in ''Upside'' magazine. According to the March 1, 1992 "On Language" column by William Safire in the New York Times Magazine, the [[term (language)|term]] was coined by [[New York Times]] editor [[Tim Race]] in a January 1992 [[New York Times]] article.&lt;ref name="urlBUSINESS TECHNOLOGY; Pools of Memory, Waves of Dispute - New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4DE103EF93AA15752C0A964958260 |title=BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY; Pools of Memory, Waves of Dispute – New York Times |author= |authorlink= |author2= |date= January 29, 1992|format= |work= The New York Times|publisher= |pages= |language= |quote= |accessdate= May 1, 2010| first=John | last=Markoff}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Race's words:

:''Actually the first use of "digerati" was in a January 29, 1992 New York Times article, "Pools of Memory, Waves of Dispute", by John Markoff, into which I edited the term. The article was about a controversy engendered by a George Gilder article that had recently appeared in Upside magazine. In a March 1, 1992 "On Language" column in The New York Times Magazine, William Safire noted the coinage and gave me the honor of defining it, which we did like so:''
::''Digerati, n.pl. – people highly skilled in the processing and manipulation of digital information; wealthy or scholarly techno-geeks.''

The '''Dutch Wikipedia''' ({{lang-{{#property:P424}}|{{#property:P1448}}}}) is the [[Dutch language|Dutch-language]] edition of the free online [[encyclopedia]], [[Wikipedia]]. It was started in June 2001. As of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the Dutch Wikipedia is the third-largest Wikipedia edition, with {{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|nl|N}} articles. It was the fourth Wikipedia edition to exceed 1 million articles, after the [[English Wikipedia|English]], [[German Wikipedia|German]] and [[French Wikipedia|French]] editions. In April 2016, 1154 active editors made at least five edits in that month.

==History==
The Dutch Wikipedia was started on 19 June 2001, and reached 100,000 articles on 14 October 2005. It briefly surpassed the [[Polish Wikipedia]] as the sixth-largest edition of Wikipedia, but then fell back to the eighth position. On 1 March 2006, it overtook the [[Swedish Wikipedia|Swedish]] and [[Italian Wikipedia|Italian]] editions in one day to rise back to the sixth position. The edition's 500,000th article was created on 30 November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[[:nl:Wikipedia:Persbericht 2008 - 500.000ste artikel|500.000e artikel]] (in Dutch). Retrieved 7 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 ''Multiscope'' research study, the Dutch Wikipedia was rated the third-best Dutch-language website, after [[Google]] and [[Gmail]], with a score of 8.1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multiscope.nl/organisatie/nieuws/sberichten/nederlandse-wikipedia-groeit-als-kool.html "Nederlandse Wikipedia groeit als kool"] (in Dutch). Multiscope.nl. Retrieved 27 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch language Wikipedia has the largest ratio of Wikipedia pages per native speaker of all of the top 10 largest Wikipedia editions. Its rate of daily article creations spiked in March 2006, rapidly growing to an average of 1,000 a day in early May 2006. After this number was reached, growth dropped to an average of only about 250 a day, comparable to the averages around December 2005. Since then, there have been more article-creation surges, one of the largest peaking at 2,000 new articles per day in September 2007, but the growth rate has always returned to the lowest average of around 250.

In 2008, Dutch [[businessman]] [[Bob Sijthoff]] attempted to sue "the Vereniging Wikimedia Nederland" and "the Stichting Wikimedia Nederland" to force the removal of his Dutch Wikipedia article, which he stated contained "false and abusive" information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dag.nl/10113940/NIEUWS/Artikelpagina-Nieuws/Ik-wil-niet-op-Wikipedia.htm 'Ik wil niet op Wikipedia!'], [[Dag (newspaper)|DAG]], November 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On December 10, 2008, the court rejected his request. The judge ruled that he had sued the wrong entity and that legal responsibility for the content of the articles would not lie in the Netherlands, but with the American [[Wikimedia Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://zoeken.rechtspraak.nl/resultpage.aspx?snelzoeken=true&amp;searchtype=kenmerken&amp;instantie_uz=Rechtbank+Utrecht&amp;veld_datumzoek=datum_gepubliceerd&amp;soort_datumzoek=Tussen&amp;datum_tussen_vanaf=10-12-2008&amp;datum_tussen_tm=10-12-2008&amp;sortby=datum_gepubliceerd Court ruling], Rechtspraak.nl, December 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet bots===
The majority of articles in Dutch Wikipedia (59%) were created by [[internet bots]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/BotActivityMatrixCreates.htm Wikipedia Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, several bots created 80,000 articles (then equivalent to 10% of the entire edition's article count) in only 11 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Wikipedias/Table&amp;oldid=3004770 List of Wikipedias on 20 October 2011 (archived)]. Wikimedia. Retrieved 24 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Wikipedias/Table&amp;oldid=3032297 List of Wikipedias on 31 October 2011 (archived)]. Wikimedia. Retrieved 24 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch Wikipedia's one-millionth article was created in December 2011, after another surge of bot activity saw 100,000 added articles in only 10 days. In late March 2013, the Dutch Wikipedia surpassed the [[French Wikipedia]] to become the third-largest edition of Wikipedia. In June 2013, it overtook the [[German Wikipedia]] to become the second-largest Wikipedia edition.

==Quality==

===Article depth===
The ''depth'' or ''editing depth'' of Wikipedia is a rough indicator of the encyclopedia's collaborative quality, showing how frequently its articles are updated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_article_depth Wikipedia article depth]; Wikimedia&lt;/ref&gt; The depth is measured by taking the average number of edits per article multiplied by the extent in which articles are supported by discussion (among other things, talk pages). Among the nine language editions with one million articles, the Dutch, Swedish, and Polish Wikipedias in that order have [[:m:Depth|depth parameters]] much lower than the other six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias|title=List of Wikipedias|publisher=Wikimedia|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2012|March}}, for the English version the article depth is 666, for the German 88, for the French 153, for the Spanish 160, for the Dutch only 18.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libguides.library.uu.nl/c.php?g=202166&amp;p=1330183 Find out more-Wikipedia]; [[Utrecht University]] Library&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bytes per article===

Compared to most other Wikipedia editions with a similar number of articles, articles on the Dutch Wikipedia have less content with an average of 1,598 bytes per article ({{as of|2014|February|lc=y}}). This is roughly 40% of that of the French, German, Italian, Russian and Spanish editions (3,986-4,277 bytes/article {{as of|2014|February|lc=y}}).&lt;ref&gt;Wikimedia Statistics, [http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesArticlesBytesPerArticle.htm Wikipedia statistics, bytes per article].

'''Federal Standard 1037C''', titled '''Telecommunications: Glossary of Telecommunication Terms''', is a [[United States]] Federal Standard issued by the [[General Services Administration]] pursuant to the [[Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949]], as amended.&lt;ref&gt;Information Administration, National Telecommunication. 1997. Telecommunications Glossary of Telecommunications Terms. Lanham: Government Institutes. http://public.eblib.com/EBLPublic/PublicView.do?ptiID=1385085&lt;/ref&gt;

This document provides federal departments and agencies a comprehensive source of definitions of terms used in [[telecommunications]] and directly related fields by international and U.S. government telecommunications specialists.

As a publication of the U.S. government, prepared by an agency of the U.S. government, it appears to be mostly available as a [[public domain]] resource, but a few items are derived from [[United States copyright law|copyrighted]] sources: where this is the case, there is an attribution to the source.

This standard was superseded in 2001 by [[American National Standards Institute|American National Standard]] T1.523-2001, Telecom Glossary 2000, which is published by  [[Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions|ATIS]]. The old standard is still frequently used, because the new standard is protected by copyright, as usual for ANSI standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ansi.org/news_publications/news_story?menuid=7&amp;articleid=5e86f650-bcb6-4995-b03b-097d5480aa12|title=U.S. District Court Rules in Favor of Copyright Protection for Standards Incorporated by Reference into Federal Regulations|website=www.ansi.org|access-date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A newer proposed standard is the "ATIS Telecom Glossary 2011", ATIS-0100523.2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7706">A '''filtered-popping recursive transition network''' ('''FPRTN'''),&lt;ref name="sastre09jb"&gt;Javier M. Sastre, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-02979-0_28 "Efficient parsing using filtered-popping recursive transition networks"], ''Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence'', '''5642''':241-244, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; or simply '''filtered-popping network''' ('''FPN'''), is a [[recursive transition network]] ([[Recursive transition network|RTN]])&lt;ref name="woods70jb"&gt; William A. Woods, [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/355598.362773 "Transition network grammars for natural language analysis"], ''Communications of the ACM'', ''ACM Press'', '''13''':10:591-606, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; extended with a map of states to keys where returning from a [[subroutine]] jump requires the acceptor and return states to be mapped to the same key. [[Recursive transition network|RTNs]] are [[finite-state machines]] that can be seen as [[finite-state automata]] extended with a [[stack (data structure)|stack]] of return states; as well as consuming transitions and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-transitions, [[Recursive transition network|RTNs]] may define call transitions. These transitions perform a [[subroutine]] jump by pushing the transition's target state onto the stack and bringing the machine to the called state. Each time an acceptor state is reached, the return state at the top of the stack is popped out, provided that the stack is not empty, and the machine is brought to this state.

Throughout this article we refer to filtered-popping recursive transition networks as ''FPNs'', though this acronym is ambiguous (e.g.: [[fuzzy Petri nets]]). ''Filtered-popping networks'' and ''FPRTNs'' are unambiguous alternatives. 

==Formal Definition==
A FPN is a structure &lt;math&gt;(Q, K, \Sigma, \delta, \kappa, Q_I, F)&lt;/math&gt; where

*&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of states,
*&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of keys,
*&lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a finite input alphabet,
*&lt;math&gt;\delta: Q \times (\Sigma \cup \{\varepsilon\} \cup Q) \to Q&lt;/math&gt; is a partial transition function, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; being the empty symbol,
*&lt;math&gt;\kappa: Q \to K&lt;/math&gt; is a map of states to keys,
*&lt;math&gt;Q_I \subseteq Q&lt;/math&gt; is the set of initial states, and
*&lt;math&gt;F \subseteq Q&lt;/math&gt; is the set of acceptance states.

==Transitions==
Transitions represent the possibility of bringing the FPN from a source state &lt;math&gt;q_s&lt;/math&gt; to a target state &lt;math&gt;q_t&lt;/math&gt; by possibly performing an additional action. Depending on this action, we distinguish the following types of ''explicitly''-defined transitions:

*'''&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-transitions''' are transitions of the form &lt;math&gt;\delta(q_s,\varepsilon) \to q_t&lt;/math&gt; and perform no additional action,
*'''consuming transitions''' are transitions of the form &lt;math&gt;\delta(q_s, \sigma) \to q_t&lt;/math&gt; and consume an input symbol &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, and
*'''call transitions''' are transitions of the form &lt;math&gt;\delta(q_s, q_c) \to q_t&lt;/math&gt; and perform a [[subroutine]] jump to called state &lt;math&gt;q_c&lt;/math&gt; before reaching &lt;math&gt;q_t&lt;/math&gt;.

The behaviour of call transitions is governed by two kinds of ''implicitly''-defined transitions:

*for each call transition &lt;math&gt;\delta(q_s, q_c) \to q_t&lt;/math&gt; the FPN implicitly defines a '''push transition''' that brings the machine from &lt;math&gt;q_s&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;q_c&lt;/math&gt; by pushing &lt;math&gt;q_t&lt;/math&gt; onto the [[stack (data structure)|stack]], and
*for each pair of states &lt;math&gt;(q_f, q_r) \in F \times Q&lt;/math&gt; the FPN implicitly defines a '''pop transition''' that brings the machine from &lt;math&gt;q_f&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;q_r&lt;/math&gt; by popping &lt;math&gt;q_r&lt;/math&gt; from the stack [[iff]] &lt;math&gt;q_r&lt;/math&gt; is the state at the top of the stack and &lt;math&gt;\kappa(q_f) = \kappa(q_r)&lt;/math&gt;.

Push transitions initialize [[subroutine]] jumps and pop transitions are equivalent to [[return statements]].

==Purpose==
A ([[natural language]]) text can be enriched with meta-information by the application of a [[RTN with output]]; for instance, a RTN inserting [[XML]] tags can be used for transforming a [[plain text]] into a structured XML document. A RTN with output representing a [[natural language]] [[grammar]] would delimit and add the syntactic structure of each text sentence (see [[parsing]]). Other RTNs with output could simply mark text segments containing relevant information (see [[information extraction]]). The application of a RTN with output representing an [[ambiguous grammar]] results in a set of possible translations or interpretations of the input. Computing this set has an exponential [[worst-case cost]], even for an [[Earley parser]] for RTNs with output,&lt;ref name="sastre09ja"&gt;Javier M. Sastre &amp;amp; Mikel L. Forcada, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04235-5_17 "Efficient parsing using recursive transition networks with output"], ''Lecture Notes in Computer Science'', '''5603''':192-204, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; due to cases in which the number of translations increases exponentially [[wikt:WRT|w.r.t.]] the input length; for instance, the number of interpretations of a [[natural language]] sentence increases exponentially w.r.t. the number of unresolved [[prepositional phrase]] attachments:&lt;ref name="ratnaparkhi98ip"&gt;Adwait Ratnaparkhi, [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P98/P98-2177.pdf "''Statistical models for unsupervised prepositional phrase attachment''"], ACL-36: Proceedings of the 36th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and 17th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pp. 1079-1085, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miriam Butt, [http://ling.uni-konstanz.de/pages/home/butt/main/material/chunk.pdf "''Chunk/Shallow parsing''"], lecture notes, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
* in sentence ''the girl saw the monkey with the telescope'', it is unknown whether the girl used the telescope or the monkey was holding it (2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; interpretations),
* in sentence ''the girl saw the monkey with the telescope in the garden'', it is also unknown whether the monkey was in the garden or the action took place in the garden (2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; interpretations),
* in sentence ''the girl saw the monkey with the telescope in the garden under the tree'', it is unknown as well whether the monkey was under the tree or the action took place under the tree (2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; interpretations),
* etc.

FPNs serve as a compact representation of this set of translations, allowing to compute it in cubic time by means of an Earley-like parser.&lt;ref name="sastre09jb"/&gt; FPN states correspond to execution states (see [[instruction steps]]) of an Earley-parser for [[RTNs]] ''without'' output, and FPN transitions correspond to possible translations of input symbols. The &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; map of the resulting FPN gives the correspondence between the represented output segments and the recognized input segments: given a recognized input sequence &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1\ldots\sigma_l&lt;/math&gt; and a FPN path &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; starting at a state &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and ending at a state &lt;math&gt;q^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; represents a possible translation of input segment &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\kappa(q)+1}\ldots\sigma_{\kappa(q^\prime)}&lt;/math&gt;. The filtered-popping feature is required in order to avoid FPN paths to represent translations of ''disconnected'' or ''overlapping'' input segments: a FPN call may contain several translation paths from the called state to an acceptor state, where the input segments they correspond to share the same start point but do not necessarily have the same length. Only return states corresponding to the same input point than the acceptor state finishing the call are ''valid'' return states.

In [[common law]] [[jurisdictions]] (e.g. [[England and Wales]], [[United States]], [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Freehold Land |url=https://www.austrade.gov.au/land-tenure/Land-tenure/freehold-land |publisher=Australian Trade Commission|access-date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canada]], and [[Ireland]]), a '''freehold''' is the common ownership of [[real property]], or land,{{efn|Strictly speaking, all land in England, Wales, and Scotland belongs to the Crown. Freehold is ownership of an estate in land rather than the land itself.  This distinction dates back to the Middle Ages and makes relatively little difference nowadays, so legal authorities often do not bother to distinguish between ownership of the land and ownership of an estate.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}}} and all immovable structures attached to such land, as opposed to a [[leasehold]], in which the property reverts to the owner of the land after the lease period has expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=Chris |year=2006 |title=Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme |location=Waterville, Maine |publisher=Thorndike Press |isbn=978-0-7862-8517-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an estate to be a freehold, it must possess two qualities: immobility (property must be land or some interest issuing out of or annexed to land) and ownership of it must be of an indeterminate duration. If the time of ownership can be fixed and determined, it cannot be a freehold.

In England and Wales, before the [[Law of Property Act 1925]], a freehold estate transferable to the owner's "[[heirs|heirs and assigns]]" (that is, successors by inheritance, or purchase (including gift), respectively) was a ''[[fee simple]]'' estate. When transfer, by inheritance or otherwise, was limited to lineal descendants ("[[heirs of the body]]" or "heirs of the blood") of the first person to whom the estate was given, it was a ''[[fee tail]]'' estate. There were also freehold estates not of inheritance, such as an [[estate for life]].

[[File:Ghost Light on Stage.JPG|thumb|A ghost light illuminating an empty stage in a darkened theater.]]

A '''ghost light''' is an electric light that is left energized on the stage of a [[theater]] when the theater is unoccupied and would otherwise be completely dark. It typically consists of an exposed [[incandescent light bulb|incandescent bulb]], [[compact fluorescent lamp|CFL lamp]], or [[LED lamp]] mounted in a wire cage on a portable light stand.&lt;ref&gt;Theater Backstage from A to Z 3rd ed. by Warren C. Lounsbury and Norman Boulanger, 1989 University of Washington Press&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually placed near center stage. Ghost lights are also sometimes known as ''equity lights'' or ''equity lamps'', possibly indicating their use was originally mandated by the [[Actors' Equity Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://listverse.com/2010/08/20/top-10-theater-superstitions/|title=Top 10 Theater Superstitions - Listverse|date=20 August 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theatrecrafts.com/page.php?id=610&lt;/ref&gt;

The practical use of a ghost light is mainly for safety. A ghost light enables one to navigate the theater to find the [[lighting control console]] and to avoid accidents such as falling into the [[orchestra pit]] and stepping on or tripping over set pieces. Aside from its obvious practical purpose, there are a number of [[superstition]]s associated with the origin and purpose of ghost lights.

==Origin and superstitions==

The superstitious have various justifications for the ghost light in relation to the supernatural. A popular [[theatrical superstition]] holds that every theater has a ghost, and some theaters have traditions to appease ghosts that reach far back into their history. For example, the [[Palace Theatre, London]] keeps two seats in their balcony permanently bolted open to provide seating for the theater ghosts.&lt;ref name="Finn"&gt;Superstition is the way by Louise Finn from The Stage 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Similar superstitions hold that ghost lights provide opportunities for ghosts to perform onstage, thus appeasing them and preventing them from cursing the theater or sabotaging the set or production. This is also used to explain the traditional one day a week that theaters are closed.&lt;ref name="Finn" /&gt;

'''Hampa Nagarajaiah''' (born 7 October 1936) popularly known by his pen name Hampanā, is a [[Kannada]] scholar on [[Jainism]]. He was born at Hampasandra Village located in [[Gowribidanur]] taluk, Chikkaballapura District in the Indian state of [[Karnataka]].

==Academics==
Hampanā completed his early education at his native village and neighbouring towns such as Gowribidanur, [[Madhugiri]], [[Tumkur]] and [[Mandya]]. Later he moved to [[Maharaja's College, Mysore]] from where he did his graduation in BA (Honours) and completed his post-graduation in [[Kannada]] under the intellectual inspiration of [[Kuvempu]], Theenamshree, D L Narasimhachar, S V Parameshwara Bhatta, K Venkataramappa, DeJaGou at [[University of Mysore]] in 1959. He was soon appointed as lecturer in Kannada and served at Mysore Maharani’s College, Sahyadri College of Shimoga and Government College at Mandya, DRM College at Davanagere and Govt. Arts &amp; Science College at Bengaluru. Meanwhile, he acquired PhD from [[Bangalore University]] for A Comprehensive study of Vaddārādhane.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Lectures==
Hampanā has delivered guest lectures on Jainism at universities in UK, Germany and USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =  | first = | title = Hampanā | url = http://www.jainworld.com/society/speaksch/Hampanāg.htm | publisher = Jain world | accessdate = 26 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also delivered lectures on linguistics, poetics and Jain literature at Bengaluru University, [[Mysore University]], [[Mangalore University]], [[Karnataka University]], [[Kuvempu University]], [[Mumbai University]], [[Madras University]] and Madhurai University.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Administrator==
He served in capacities like professor and dean of arts faculty in Bengaluru University. He also officiated as Director of Jain Research Centre, Director of Institute of Jain Studies, and Director of Department of Kannada and Culture in [[Government of Karnataka]] before retiring in 1996.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

He also served as an honorary secretary of the Kannada Literary Chair called [[Kannada Sahitya Parishat]] from 1966 to 1974 and was elected as its president for three terms during 1978-1986.  During his tenure he has published about 300 books in Kannada authored by scholars. When [[UNESCO]] declared 1979 as [[International Children’s Year]] he published through KaSaPa, 200 books for children written by different writers. He is the man behind erecting a building to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of KaSaPa in the premise of Krishnaraja Parishanmandira.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

'''Hidayat Khudush oglu Orujov''' ({{lang-az|Hidayət Orucov Xuduş oğlu}}; born September 5, 1944) is a notable writer and an [[Azerbaijan]]i politician serving as the [[State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations (Azerbaijan)|Chairman of State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations of Azerbaijan Republic]].

==Early life==
Orujov was born on September 5, 1944 in [[Maralzami]] village of [[Syunik Region]], [[Armenia]]. He graduated from Philology department of [[Azerbaijan State University]]. After graduation, he worked as a teacher in his village and for ''Soviet Armenia'' newspaper for a brief period of time, and in July 1968 he was appointed the Director of ''Jaffar Jabbarli [[Yerevan|Iravan]] State Azerbaijan Drama Theater'' where he worked for 6 years.
As a writer he was known under alias ''Hidayet''. Orujov also headed the [[Azerbaijani literature]] Council of the [[Writers Union of Armenia]] and taught Azerbaijani Literature of 19th-20th centuries at [[Armenian State Pedagogical University]]. He's creditted for publishing numerous books on Azerbaijani and Oghuz literature in Yerevan.&lt;ref name=Min&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scwra.gov.az/view.php?lang=az&amp;menu=193&amp;id=258 |title=Azərbaycan Respublikasının Dini Qurumlarla İş üzrə Dövlət Komitəsi.

In March 1984, he moved to [[Baku]] and was hired as the Assistant Editor of ''Gənclik'' (Youth) Publishing House and in March 1986, he was appointed the Chief Editor of the publishing house, a position which he held until 1992. While an editor, he substantially expanded the library of books on Azerbaijan in international markets. A fifteen volume ''Azerbaijani folklore'', twenty five volume ''Adventures and Mystics'', seventeen volume ''Literature of nations of USSR'' were published under Orujov's leadership. Orujov has also been board member of Azerbaijani Writer's Union and ''Literature'' newspaper.&lt;ref name=Min/&gt;

==Political career==
In the early stages of the [[Karabakh movement]] leading up to the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] and days before the [[Sumgait pogrom]], Hidayat Orujov, a leader of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan, warned Armenians in Sumgait: "If you do not stop campaigning for the unification of Nagorno Karabakh with Armenia, if you don't sober up, 100,000 Azeris from neighboring districts will break into your houses, torch your apartments, rape your women, and kill your children."&lt;ref name="Anti-Armenian 1"&gt;[http://beta.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/2/28/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/E211-2 HONORING THE VICTIMS OF SUMGAIT (Extensions of Remarks - February 28, 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anti-Armenian 2"&gt;[http://www.aaainc.org/fileadmin/aaainc/pdf/2013/SUMGAIT_THE_PUBLIC_RECORD.pdf SUMGAIT POGROM OF 1988: THE PUBLIC RECORD. Armenian Assembly of America 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992-1993, Orujov served as the State Advisor on Interethnic Relations to the [[President of Azerbaijan]]. In 1993-2006, he was the State Advisor on National Policies; in 2005-2006, he served as the State Advisor on Ethnic Minorities and Religious Organizations to the President of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=Min/&gt; On June 27, 2006 he was appointed the Chairman of State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations of Azerbaijan Republic replacing Dr. Rafig Aliyev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://en.trend.az/news/politics/856772.html |title=Azeri president dismissed head of State Committee on Work with Religious Organizations |publisher= [[Trend News Agency]] |author= | date=2006-06-27 |accessdate= 2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the chairman of the state committee, he has paid special attention to preventing registrations of religious organizations allegedly being recommended by foreign special services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.apa.az/en/news.php?id=131625 |title=Hidayat Orujov: "Some religious associations in Azerbaijan build their activities on the basis of recommendations by foreign special services" |publisher=[[Azeri Press Agency]] |author=Ramil Mammadli |date=2010-10-08 |accessdate=2010-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005171101/http://www.apa.az/en/news.php?id=131625 |archivedate=2011-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works and awards==
Orujov has been awarded with ''Honorable Arts Contributor of Armenian SSR'' award in 1978, ''[[Order for Personal Courage]]'' in 1970, and was honored with awards from the [[Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan SSR]]. In 1989, after Armenians laid claims on [[Karabakh]] region of [[Azerbaijan]], Orujov renunciated his award from Armenian SSR. 
Since the independence of Azerbaijan was restored, he has also been awarded with [[Shohrat Order]] of Azerbaijan Republic, ''International Paydulla Iskeyev Literature Award of [[Chuvash Republic]]'' and a number of awards from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Dagestan]].&lt;ref name=Min/&gt;

In 1917 the '''Hosic Report''' on the Reorganization of English in ([[United States]]) Secondary Schools placed courteous letter writing as a number one priority. This might provide rationale for why Pennell and Cusack (1924), writers of a manual for [[teacher]]s of reading activities, included letter writing in suggested instructional activities. Other important activities suggested in the Hosic report were expository writing, analysis of writing pieces, reports, literary composition, and debate.

In 1917, the Hosic Report on the Reorganization of English in the Secondary Schools the first report to cite the relationship between speaking and writing, reported that the purpose of teaching composition was to enable the student to speak and write correctly to convince and interest the reader (Burrows, 1977). The first step was to cultivate sincerity through language; next to develop accuracy; and last to arouse artistic and individual expression. The goals focused on developing effective content and correct form including handwriting, spelling, grammar, capitals, and punctuation. Beyond these goals, importance was placed on enlarging vocabulary through reading. Reading authors with "concise and vigorous style" was encouraged so that the students could imitate "fine writing" (Burrows, 1977, p.&amp;nbsp;28).

From the 1917 Hosic Report, the teacher was urged to focus on developing the individual writer rather than certain forms and rules. The teacher was to observe and respond to the maturing of each student’s growth in thought and expression. This sounds very much like teachers were being instructed to teach in response to the individual learner rather than just deliver a scripted program. Teachers were told to offer many opportunities for students to write and speak on topics that were familiar and of interest to them so that they could give attention to correctness and present thoughts to convince and interest others. The belief was that composition should grow out of the experiences of the child.

The experiences included recent field trips and outside interests such as home activities and sports. Purpose and audience were stressed. In teaching composition, interesting content came first followed in importance by organization and then mechanics (punctuation, spelling, sentence structure, and word choice).

The Hosic report stated that fact writing and imaginative writing came from two types of minds. It went on to say that short story writing should not be a passing standard for students but that they should be given opportunities to see if they had a talent for it. For those that did show talent and interest, special training should be provided. The same was advocated for debating. Teachers were encouraged to use pictures to stimulate writing development using newspaper editorial cartoons as examples. Authentic purposes for letter writing with students’ interest as content were promoted. Letters by Stevenson, Dickens, Carroll, and Lincoln served as models for informal letter writing. Whose letters today would be excellent exemplars? The report mentioned that students who were clever at writing conversations which was a sign of character should have special training in dramatization and material for dramatizations could be used from local history. Smith (2002) reported that in 1920 (soon after this report) that suggestions for dramatizations followed longer stories in readers to support comprehension. Repeatedly, the Hosic Report stressed that the work should spring from the students' interests. It was after this report in the 1920s that Language Experience Charts based on children’s experiences were initiated. Reading material was developed by using students’ own compositions about their firsthand experiences (Smith, 2002). It was also at this time that ability grouping, flexible promotions, differentiated assignments, and promoting individual progression were reported (Smith, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;183). The emphasis in writing and reading instruction at this time seemed to be giving birth to differentiated instruction and responding to student interest. The 1917 Hosic Report proposed that composition activities should come from the life of the student and "develop in him the power to express his individual experiences" (Burrows, 1977, p.&amp;nbsp;32). Developing the skill of oral composition was also a strong emphasis in order to develop the power to think in front of an audience and find language for personal expression.

James Hosic, author of this report, was an Emeritus professor at Teachers College, [[Columbia University]] as well as being the first Secretary (now Executive Director) of the [[National Council of Teachers of English]] from 1911 through 1920.

'''[[ISO 639-3]]''' is an international standard for language codes. In defining some of its language codes, some are classified as '''macrolanguages''', which include other individual languages in the standard. This category exists to assist mapping between another set of languages codes, [[ISO 639-2]], and [[ISO 639-3]]. ISO 639-3 is curated by SIL International, ISO 639-2 is curated by the Library of Congress (USA).

The mapping often has the implication that it covers borderline cases where two language varieties may be considered strongly divergent dialects of the same language or very closely related languages ([[dialect continuum]]s). It may also encompass situations when there are language varieties that are sometimes considered to be varieties of the same language and sometimes different languages for ethnic or political rather than linguistic reasons. However, this is not its primary function and the classification is not evenly applied. For example, "[[Chinese language|Chinese]]" is a macrolanguage encompassing [[Varieties of Chinese|many languages]] that are not mutually intelligible, but the languages "[[Standard German]]", "[[Bavarian language|Bavarian German]]", and other closely related languages do ''not'' form a macrolanguage despite being more mutually intelligible. Other examples include [[Tajik language|Tajiki]] not being part of the [[Persian language|Persian macrolanguage]] despite sharing much lexicon, and [[Urdu]] and [[Hindi]] not forming a macrolanguage. Even all dialects of Hindi are considered as [[Hindi belt|separate languages]]. Basically, ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-3 use different criteria for dividing language varieties into languages, 639-2 uses shared writing systems and literature more whereas 639-3 focuses on mutual intelligibility and shared lexicon. The macrolanguages exist within the ISO 639-3 code set to make mapping between the two sets easier.

There are fifty-six language codes in [[ISO 639-2]] that are considered to be macrolanguages in ISO 639-3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Scope of denotation for language identifiers | publisher = SIL International | url = http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/scope.asp#M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of this category of macrolanguage was applied in ''[[Ethnologue]]'', starting in the 16th edition.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, M. Paul, ed. (2009). ''[[Ethnologue]]''. Dallas: SIL International.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the macrolanguages had no individual language (as defined by 639-3) in ISO 639-2, e.g. "ara" ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]), but ISO 639-3 recognizes different varieties of Arabic as separate languages under some circumstances. Others, like "nor" ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]) had their two individual parts (nno [[Nynorsk]], nob [[Bokmål]]) already in 639-2. That means some languages (e.g. "arb" [[Standard Arabic]]) that were considered by ISO 639-2 to be dialects of one language ("ara") are now in ISO 639-3 in certain contexts considered to be individual languages themselves. This is an attempt to deal with varieties that may be linguistically distinct from each other, but are treated by their speakers as forms of the same language, e.g. in cases of [[diglossia]]. For example,

* Generic Arabic, 639-2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: ara | publisher = SIL International | url = http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=ara}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Standard Arabic, 639-3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: arb | publisher = SIL International | url = http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=arb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISO 639-2 also includes codes for collections of languages; these are not the same as macrolanguages. These collections of languages are excluded from ISO 639-3, because they never refer to individual languages. Most such codes are included in [[ISO 639-5]].

|This code was deprecated in 2000 because there were separate language codes for each individual language represented (Serbian, Croatian, and then Bosnian was added). It was published in a revision of ISO 639-1, but was never included in ISO 639-2. It is considered a macrolanguage (general name for a cluster of closely related individual languages) in ISO 639-3. Its deprecated status was reaffirmed by the ISO 639 JAC in 2005.

'''Interlanguage fossilization''' is a phenomenon of [[second language acquisition]] (SLA) in which [[second language]] learners develop and retain a [[natural language|linguistic]] system, or [[interlanguage]], that is self-contained and different from both the learner's [[first language]] and the target language.&lt;ref name=nemser71&gt;Nemser, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; This linguistic system has been variously called interlanguage,&lt;ref name=selinker72&gt;(Selinker, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt; approximative system,&lt;ref name=nemser71 /&gt; idiosyncratic [[dialect]]s, or transitional dialects.&lt;ref name=corder71&gt;Corder, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of interlanguage==
According to Corder&lt;ref name=corder81&gt;Corder, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; this temporary and changing [[grammar|grammatical system]], interlanguage, which is constructed by the learner, approximates the grammatical system of the target language. In the process of second language acquisition, interlanguage continually evolves into an ever-closer approximation of the target language, and ideally should advance gradually until it becomes equivalent, or nearly equivalent, to the target language. However, during the second language learning process, an interlanguage may reach one or more temporary restricting phases when its development appears to be detained.&lt;ref name=nemser71 /&gt;&lt;ref name=selinker72 /&gt;&lt;ref name=schumann75&gt;Schumann, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; A permanent cessation of progress toward the target language has been referred to as fossilization.&lt;ref name=selinker72 /&gt; This linguistic phenomenon, interlanguage fossilization, can occur despite all reasonable attempts at learning.&lt;ref name=selinker72 /&gt; Fossilization includes those items, rules, and sub-systems that second language learners tend to retain in their interlanguage, that is, all those aspects of interlanguage that become entrenched and permanent, and that  the majority of second language learners can only eliminate  with considerable effort.&lt;ref&gt;Omaggio, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it has also been noticed that this occurs particularly in adult second language learners' interlanguage systems.&lt;ref name=nemser71 /&gt;&lt;ref name=selinker72 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Selinker &amp; Lamendella, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fossilization of interlanguage==
Selinker suggests that the most important distinguishing factor related to second language acquisition is the phenomenon of fossilization.&lt;ref name=selinker72 /&gt; However, both his explanation that "fossilizable linguistic phenomena are linguistic items, rules, and subsystems which speakers of a particular native language will tend to keep in their interlanguage relative to a particular target language, no matter what the age of the learner or amount of explanation or instruction he receives in the target language"&lt;ref name=selinker72 /&gt; and his hypotheses on interlanguage fossilization are fascinating in that they contradict our basic understanding of the human capacity to learn. How is it that some learners can overcome interlanguage fossilization, even if they only constitute, according to Selinker, "a mere 5%",&lt;ref name=selinker72 /&gt; while the majority of second language learners cannot, "no matter what the age or amount of explanation or instruction"?  Or is it perhaps not that they cannot overcome fossilization, but that they will not? Does complacency set in after second language learners begin to communicate, as far as they are concerned, effectively enough, in the target language, and as a result does [[motivation]] to achieve native-like competence diminish?

The concept of fossilization in SLA research is so intrinsically related to interlanguage that Selinker considers it to be a fundamental phenomenon of all SLA and not just to adult learners.&lt;ref name=selinker72 /&gt; Fossilization has received such wide recognition that it has been entered in the ''Random House Dictionary of the English Language'' (1987). Selinker's concept of fossilization is similar to that of Nemser,&lt;ref name=nemser71 /&gt; Tarone,&lt;ref&gt;Tarone (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; and Sridhar,&lt;ref&gt;Sridhar (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; all of whom attempted to explore the causes of fossilization in second language learners' interlanguage.

Fossilization has attracted considerable interest among researchers and has engendered significant differences of opinion. The term, borrowed from the field of [[paleontology]], conjures up an image of dinosaurs being enclosed in residue and becoming a set of hardened remains encased in sediment. The metaphor, as used in SLA literature, is appropriate because it refers to earlier language forms that become encased in a learner's interlanguage and that, theoretically, cannot be changed by special attention or practice of the target language. Despite debate over the degree of permanence, fossilization is generally accepted as a fact of life in the process of SLA.

==Research==
Many researchers have attempted to explain this.&lt;ref name=nemser71 /&gt;&lt;ref name=selinker72 /&gt;&lt;ref name=corder71 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adjemian, 1976"&gt;Adjemian, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Corder, 1978"&gt;Corder, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Prada Creo, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nakuma, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schumann, 1976"&gt;Schumann, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schumann, 1978a"&gt;Schumann, 1978a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schumann, 1978b"&gt;Schumann, 1978b&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schumann, 1990"&gt;Schumann, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Workers have attempted to discover: 1) why fossilization occurs,&lt;ref name="Adjemian, 1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schumann, 1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schumann, 1978a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schumann, 1978b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schumann, 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Naiman, et al., 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seliger, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stern, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Virgil &amp; Oller, 1976"&gt;Virgil &amp; Oller, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; 2) the precipitating conditions,&lt;ref name="Schumann, 1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schumann, 1978a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schumann, 1978b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schumann, 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Virgil &amp; Oller, 1976"/&gt; 3) what kind of linguistic material is likely to be fossilized,&lt;ref&gt;Selinker &amp; Lakshamanan 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todeva, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and 4) what type of learners are more prone to fossilize.&lt;ref name="Adjemian, 1976"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scovel, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scovel, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scovel, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scovel, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Selinker, Swain &amp; Dumas, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Virgil &amp; Oller&lt;/ref&gt; However, there has been almost no investigation by SLA theorists on the possibilities of preventing or overcoming fossilization, and little explanation related to those adult second language learners who overcome one or more "areas of stability" in interlanguage—those learners whose interlanguage does not fossilize, and who reach a high level of proficiency in the second language.&lt;ref name=selinker72 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Acton, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birdsong, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bongaerts, et al., 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ioup, Boustagui, El Tigi, &amp; Mosell, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

One factor of obvious relevance is motivation, and studies have been conducted regarding motivation to learning second language,&lt;ref name="Schumann, 1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schumann, 1978a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schumann, 1978b"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner &amp; Smythe, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; and the relationship of fossilization to the learner's communicative needs.&lt;ref name="Corder, 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nickel, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ushioda, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments have emerged regarding adult learners' general lack of empathy with target language native speakers and culture. According to Guiora et al.,&lt;ref name="Guiora, 1972"&gt;Guiora et al. (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; adults do not have the motivation to change their accent and to acquire native-like pronunciation. Unlike children, who are generally more open to target language culture, adults have more rigid language ego boundaries. Thus, adults may be inclined to establishing their pre-existing cultural and ethnic identity, and this they do by maintaining their stereotypical accent.&lt;ref name="Guiora, 1972" /&gt; Notwithstanding this, there is a lack of needed research, particularly regarding achievement motivation, especially considering that fossilization can be considered the most distinctive characteristic of adult SLA.

'''Judaeo-Georgian''' ({{lang-ka|ყივრული ენა}}) (also known as '''Kivruli''' and '''Gruzinic''') is the traditional [[Georgian dialect]] spoken by the [[Georgian Jews]], the ancient [[Jewish]] community of the [[Caucasus]] nation of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

==Relationship to other languages==
Judaeo-Georgian is the only [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]] Jewish dialect.  Its status as a distinct language from the [[Georgian language]] is the subject of some debate.

With the exception of a significant number of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] [[loanword]]s, the language is reportedly largely mutually intelligible with [[Georgian language|Georgian]].

==Distribution==
Judaeo-Georgian has approximately 85,000 speakers.  These include 20,000 speakers in Georgia (1995 est.), and about 59,800 speakers in Israel (2000 est.).  The language has approximately 4,000 speakers in [[New York (state)|New York]] and undetermined numbers in other communities in [[Russia]], [[Belgium]], the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

==Status==
Judaeo-Georgian is, like many [[Jewish languages]] spoken there, on the decline in [[Israel]].  Its status in Georgia itself is unchanged, except by the rapid decline in the size of the language community, due to emigration beginning in the 1970s, which has seen the departure of some 80% of the community.  Authoritative studies of its continued use by other expatriate communities of Georgian Jews have not been conducted.

The '''Kannada grammar''' ({{lang-kn|ಕನ್ನಡ ವ್ಯಾಕರಣ}}) is primarily based on [[Keshiraja]]'s [[Shabdamanidarpana]] (c. 1260 CE) which provides the fullest systematic exposition of [[Kannada language]].&lt;ref name="GS Gai"&gt;''Studies in Indian History, Epigraphy, and Culture'' &amp;ndash; By Govind Swamirao Gai, pp. 315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="F. Kittel, 'A Grammar of the Kannada Language'"&gt;''A Grammar of the Kannada Language'' F.Kittel (1993), pp. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier grammatical works include portions of ''[[Kavirajamarga]]'' (a treatise on ''alańkāra'') of 9th century, ''Kavyavalokana'' and ''Karnatakabhashabhushana'' both authored by [[Nagavarma II]] in first half of the 12th century.&lt;ref name="F. Kittel, 'A Grammar of the Kannada Language'" /&gt;
The grammar of [[Kannada language|Kannada]] differs greatly from that of the [[Indo-European languages]]. As a [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian language]], Kannada is not genetically related to [[Sanskrit]], [[Hindi]] or any of the [[Indo-Aryan languages]] spoken in [[India]].

Various grammatical aspects of Kannada include, tatsama&amp;ndash;tadbhava, vibhakti pratyaya, kāla (tense-forms), linga (gender-forms), sandhi, samāsa, chandassu, alańkāra; and different [[metre (poetry)|poetrical metres]] such as ''vritta'', ''[[tripadi]]'', ''kanda'' (also called, ''choupadi'' or ''chaturpadi''), ''shatpadi'', sāngatya and others.

The name given for a pure, true letter is ''akshara'', ''akkara'' or ''varna''. Each letter has its own form (''ākāra'') and sound (''shabda''); providing the visible and audible representations, respectively. Kannada is written from left to right.&lt;ref name="F. Kittel, 'A Grammar of the Kannada Language', pp 5" &gt;''A Grammar of the Kannada Language'' F.Kittel (1993), pp. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Kannada alphabet]] (''aksharamale'' or ''varnamale'') now consists of 49 letters.&lt;ref name="urlBhashaIndia.com :: Kannada"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bhashaindia.com/Patrons/LanguageTech/Kannada.aspx |title=BhashaIndia.com :: Kannada |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each sound has its own distinct letter, and therefore every word is pronounced exactly as it is spelt; so the ear is a sufficient guide. After the exact sounds of the letters have been once gained, every word can be pronounced with perfect accuracy. The accent falls on the first syllable. &lt;ref name="F. Kittel, 'A Grammar of the Kannada Language', pp 5" /&gt;

The first treatise on Kannada grammar in English was written in 1864 by [[Thomas Hodson|Rev. Thomas Hodson]], a Wesleyan missionary, as ''An Elementary Grammar of the Kannada, or Canarese Language''&lt;ref name=Grammar&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hodson|first1=T|title=An Elementary Grammar of Kannada or Canarese Language|date=1864|publisher=Wesleyan Mission Press|location=Bangalore|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ozwLAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=An+Elementary+Grammar+of+the+Kannada,+or+Canarese+Language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d3ahaDmGJQ&amp;sig=kwViah-f4GPa3yNadm5NWaJ3eFs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_-b_nkKjJAhXELaYKHcA_ANoQ6AEIJzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=An%20Elementary%20Grammar%20of%20the%20Kannada%2C%20or%20Canarese%20Language&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nouns (ನಾಮಪದ)==

=== Gender (ಲಿಂಗ) ===
According to Keshiraja's ''Shabdamanidarpana'', there are nine gender forms in Kannada. However, in [[modern Kannada literature]] only three gender forms are used in practice: masculine, feminine, and neuter.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Kittel, pp. 39&lt;/ref&gt;
All Kannada nouns code for [[Grammatical gender|gender]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hodson, Thomas. ''An Elementary Grammar of the Kannada Language''. New Delhi: Asian Educational Services, 1979. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Biological sex tends to correspond with the grammatical gender category. However, certain concepts personified by deities, such as ''sūrya'', meaning 'the sun', share the grammatical gender of the deity, which in this case is masculine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

;masculine gender (ಪುಲ್ಲಿಂಗ)
*Examples: ''arasa'' ('king'), ''dore'' ('master, lord'), ''vāyu'' ('wind')

;feminine gender (ಸ್ತ್ರೀಲಿಂಗ)
*Examples: [[Parvati]], [[Lakshmi]], [[Saraswati]], ''amma'' ('mother')

;neuter gender (ನಪುಂಸಕಲಿಂಗ)
Nouns that do not belong to either of the above two classes are considered to have neuter gender.
*Examples: love ({{lang|kn|ಪ್ರೀತಿ}}), world ({{lang|kn|ಲೋಕ}}), tree ({{lang|kn|ಮರ}}), bear ({{lang|kn|ಕರಡಿ}}), river ({{lang|kn|ನದಿ}})

=== Case (ವಿಭಕ್ತಿ) ===
Kannada has seven cases:&lt;ref&gt;Andronov, Mikhail Sergeevich. ''A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian Languages''. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[nominative case]]	(ಕರ್ತೃ, kartr̥)
*[[accusative case]]	(ಕರ್ಮ ವಿಭಕ್ತಿ, karma vibhakti)
*[[Instrumental case|instrumental]]-[[Ablative case|ablative]] case	(ಕರಣ ವಿಭಕ್ತಿ, karaṇa vibhakti)
*[[dative case]]	(ಸಂಪ್ರದಾನ ವಿಭಕ್ತಿ)
*[[genitive case]]	(ಸಂಬಂಧ ವಿಭಕ್ತಿ)
*[[locative case]]	(ಅಧಿಕರಣ ವಿಭಕ್ತಿ)
*[[vocative case]]	(ಸಂಬೋಧನಾ ವಿಭಕ್ತಿ)
Because the traditional study of Kannada grammar is based on Sanskrit grammar, a fifth case (since the dative case is the fourth case and the genitive case is the sixth in the traditional order of the cases) is sometimes considered: the [[ablative case]]	(ಅಪಾದಾನವಿಭಕ್ತಿ). This case is formed periphrastically by combining the genitive case of the noun supposedly in the ablative with the instrumental-case form of the noun 'ದೆಸೆ', meaning 'cause, vicinity, place, point'. Thus the Kannada ablative literally translates to 'from/by the cause/point of the {noun}'. However, this 'ablative' form is not commonly used colloquially, and exists only for propriety—it is not a true case, serving only to provide a parallel to the Sanskrit ablative.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Ziegler, F. ''A Practical Key to the Kannada Language''. New Delhi: Asian Educational Services, 1984. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In its place, the third case, the instrumental-ablative case, is normally used.

*Example: ''Maradiṁda allige hōdenu.'' (''literally:'' 'From the tree to there I went.'; ''idiomatically:'' 'I went there from the tree.')

Of course, ''Marada deseyiṁda allige hōdenu.'' would also be correct.
Note that the nominative-case and accusative-case forms of a noun are often in the colloquial dialect substituted by the crude base.

=== Number (ವಚನ) ===

There are, as in English, two grammatical [[Grammatical number|numbers]]: the [[singular number]] (ಏಕವಚನ) and the [[plural number]] (ಬಹುವಚನ).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Schiffman, Harold F. ''A Reference Grammar of Spoken Kannada''. Seattle: U of Washington, 1983. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In declension, the plural form of a masculine or feminine noun is made by suffixing 'ಅರ್' to the crude base, and then the case-termination, and the plural form of a neuter noun is made by suffixing 'ಗಳ್' to the crude base, and then the case-termination. However, nouns of relationship, such as 'mother', 'great-grandfather', 'son-in-law', and 'younger brother', which are always masculine or feminine, have the plural number marker "ಅಂದಿರ್'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Declension (ವಿಭಕ್ತಿ ಪರಿಣಾಮ) ===

Kannada has ''four'' declensions, or groups of case-terminations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first declension includes all masculine and feminine nouns that end in 'ಅ'; the second declension includes all neuter nouns that end in 'ಅ'; the third declension includes all nouns of all genders that end in 'ಇ', 'ಈ', 'ಎ', 'ಏ', or 'ಐ'; the fourth declension includes all nouns of all genders that end in 'ಉ', ಊ', 'ಋ', 'ೠ', 'ಓ', or 'ಔ'.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Kittel, Ferdinand. ''A Grammar of the Kannaḍa Language in English: Comprising the Three Dialects of the Language (ancient, Mediæval and Modern)''. Mangalore: Basel Mission Book and Tract Depository, 1903. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Below are the 'standard' case-terminations, which are suffixed to the plural number markers to create the full case-termination in the plural. However, in the singular number, all the declensions use variations of the 'standard' case-terminations as the final case-terminations.

==== Declensional sandhi (ವಿಭಕ್ತಿಪರಿಣಾಮದ ಸಂಧಿ) ====

[[Sandhi]] is the mutation of the final or initial letters of a word for euphony. Sandhi occurs very often in declension.

In the first declension and in the second declension, the only sandhi that occurs is the elision (dropping) of the final 'ಅ' ('atva') before a plural marker or case-termination that begins with a vowel.

In the third declension, a euphonic 'ಯ್' ('yatva') must be inserted after the noun before a plural marker or case-termination that begins with a vowel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the fourth declension, a euphonic 'ವ್' ('vatva') must be inserted after the noun before a plural marker or case-termination that begins with a vowel. However, when a Kannada noun ends in a 'ಉ' that was already added for euphony at some original stage, that final vowel is eliminated when the noun is followed by a plural marker or case-termination that begins with a vowel.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, the Kannada word for ‘table’ is ‘ಮೇಜು', from the Persian ‘''mez''’. In transference, the
final ‘z’ of ‘''mez''’ became a ‘j’, since Kannada has no letter to represent the ‘z’ sound. However, ‘ಮೇಜ್’ does not sound good in Kannada—so a euphonic ‘ಉ’ was added to the crude base of the word. However, because technically the true base has no final vowel (although the base still takes the fourth declension endings), that euphonic ‘ಉ’ of ‘ಮೇಜು’ is elided during declension. These words that already have a euphonic 'ಉ' that is elided during declension attached to their end must be learned, but most native Kannada, or originally Kannada, words have this 'euphonic "ಉ" ' on their end, because not many Kannada words originally ended in 'ಉ'.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;McKerrel, John. ''Grammar of the Carnataca Language''. Madras: College, 1820. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that for the instrumental case, the genitive case, and the locative case, the case-termination first given is generally preferred.

== Modifiers (ಪರಿವರ್ತಕಗಳು) ==

Kannada, as does English, uses adjectives and adverbs as modifiers. Kannada does not have articles. However, the adjectives 'ಆ' ('that') and 'ಒಂದು' ('one') can be used as the definite and the indefinite article, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Kannada possess few adjectives that are not derived from some noun. Adjectivalizing suffixes include 'ಆದ' (''literally:'' 'which/that became') and 'ಇಕ'.

''Example: sundaravāda hengasu - ಸುಂದರವಾದ ಹೆಂಗಸು ('a beautiful woman'), aitihāsika dina - ಐತಿಹಾಸಿಕ ದಿನ  ('a historic day')''

Kannada lacks true predicate adjectives. To use an adjective predicatively, suffix the third-person pronoun to the end of the adjective that matches the subject.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

''Example: Ā hengasu sundaravādavaļu - ಆ ಹೆಂಗಸು ಸುಂದರವಾದವಳು. ('That woman (is) beautiful.')''

Adverbs are formed by the suffix 'ಆಗಿ'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Adverbs can be added to adjectives or to nouns,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; unlike in English, where '-ly' can only be suffixed to adjectives.
*Example: ''sundaravāgi'' ('beautifully', from '''&lt;nowiki&gt;sundara'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' ["beauty"] + 'ಆಗಿ')

== Verbs (ಕ್ರಿಯಾಪದಗಳು) ==

~=== Sandhi with verb inflection (ಕ್ರಿಯಾಪದಗಳ ರೂಪನಿಷ್ಪತ್ತಿಯ ಸಂಧಿ) ===

Sandhi is the mutation of the final or initial letters of a word for euphony. Sandhi with verbs applies in any case when the form of a verb is being changed.

When any verb form (ಕ್ರಿಯಾರೂಪ) ends with the vowel 'ಅ' ('atva') or with the vowel 'ಉ' ('utva'), eliminate that final vowel if a suffix that begins with a vowel follows.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

	''ಬರು (crude verb form; 'come') → ಬರ್  + ಅಲಿ (third person singular imperative suffix) = ಬರಲಿ''

When the ''crude form/root'' of the verb (ಕ್ರಿಯಾಪಕೃತಿ) ends with the vowel 'ಇ' ('itva') or with the vowel 'ಎ' ('etva') or with the vowel 'ಆ' ('ātva'), insert a euphonic 'ಯ್' ('yatva') after the form if a suffix that begins with a vowel follows.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''ಬರೆ (crude verb form; 'write') → ಬರೆಯ್ + ಅಲ್ (infinitive form suffix) + ಪಟ್ಟಿತು (past passive third person singular neuter suffix) = ಬರೆಯಲ್ಪಟ್ಟಿತು (past passive third person neuter form of 'ಬರೆ'; 'it was written')''

When any other form of the verb ends with the vowel 'ಇ' ('itva') or with the vowel 'ಎ' ('etva'), eliminate that final vowel if a suffix that begins with a vowel follows.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; No other verb form other than the crude form/root of a verb will end in 'ಆ'.

''ಮಾಡು (crude verb form; 'make') → ಮಾಡಿ (past adverbial participle; 'having made') + ಇತು (past active third person singular imperative suffix) = ಮಾಡಿತು''

=== Finite verb forms (ಆಖ್ಯಾತರೂಪಗಳು) ===

Kannada verbs have several forms: an affirmative form (ನಿಶ್ಚಯರೂಪ), a
contingent-future, or potential, form (ಸಂಭಾವರೂಪ),
an imperative form (ವಿಧಿರೂಪ),
and a negative form (ನಿಷೇಧರೂಪ).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Spencer, Harold, and W. Perston. ''A Kanarese Grammar: With Graduated Exercises''. Mysore: Printed at the Wesley, 1950. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
The action of a verb in the affirmative form does happen, but the action
of a verb in the negative form does not happen. The contingent-future form
expresses the idea of the possibility of an action’s occurrence at the present
or in the future; the imperative form commands, exhorts, or optates.

As in English, the three tenses (ಕಾಲಗಳು)
include the present tense (ವರ್ತಮಾನಕಾಲ),
the past tense (ಭೂತಕಾಲ),
and the future tense (ಭವಿಷ್ಯತ್ತುಕಾಲ).
However, distinct forms for each of these tenses exist only in the
affirmative form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The imperative form, as in English lacks tense, and because
of the meaning of the contingent-future form, it also lacks tense distinctions.
The negative form is peculiar, for its forms can possess a present-tense,
past-tense, or future-tense meaning, to be inferred from context; in the modern
dialect, other modes of negation are employed.

There are two grammatical aspects (ಸ್ಥಿತಿಗಳು)
of verbs—the perfect aspect (ಪೂರ್ಣವಾಚಕ
ಸ್ಥಿತಿ), in which the action has already occurred at the time expressed
by the tense of the verb, and the progressive aspect (ಗತಿಸೂಚಕ ಸ್ಥಿತಿ), in which the
action is ongoing at the time expressed by the tense of the verb.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The expression of voice (ಪ್ರಯೋಗ)
in Kannada is quite different than in English, but the same two voices
exist in both languages—the active voice (ಕರ್ತರೀ ಪ್ರಯೋಗ) and the passive voice (ಕರ್ಮಣಿ ಪ್ರಯೋಗ).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Finite Kannada verbs are conjugated for all these properties as well as
three properties of the subject: person (ಪುರುಷ),
number (ವಚನ), and
gender (ಲಿಂಗ).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There
are three persons in Kannada as in English—the first person (ಉತ್ತಮ ಪುರುಷ), the second person
(ಮಧ್ಯಮ ಪುರುಷ),
and the third person (ಪ್ರಥಮ
ಪುರುಷ)—as well as a singular number (ಏಕವಚನ) and a plural number (ಬಹುವಚನ). Whether a noun is of
the masculine gender (ಪುಲ್ಲಿಂಗ),
of the feminine gender (ಸ್ತ್ರೀಲಿಂಗ),
or of the neuter gender (ನಪುಂಸಕಲಿಂಗ)
is decided semantically. All nouns denoting male entities, including
entities personified—for example, religiously—as male entities, are masculine,
and all feminine nouns denote female entities or femalely personified entities;
the remaining nouns fall into the neuter gender.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Non-finite verb forms (ಕ್ರಿಯಾಪದಗಳ ಅವ್ಯಯರೂಪಗಳು) ===

The first non-finite verb form is the infinitive form (ಭಾವರೂಪ). There are three infinitives, which vary in their uses and their endings.
Other than the infinitive, Kannada has two types of participle—an adjectival participle (ಕೃದ್ವಾಚಿ) and an adverbial participle (ಕ್ರಿಯಾನ್ಯೂನ). While the present participle of English can function both adjectivally and adverbially, and the past participle can function only adjectivally, Kannada participles’ functions are quite consistent.
The Kannada adjectival participle is peculiar, for it takes the place of the relative pronoun that introduces a restrictive relative clause, the verb of the relative clause, and if the relative pronoun is a prepositional complement, of the governing preposition. There is a present-future adjectival participle, as well as a past adjectival participle.
The adverbial participle has a present-tense form and a past-tense form, and modifies the verb of the sentence. The adverbial participle may accept its own nominative, as may the adjectival participle in its clause.
Kannada does not have a gerund, but nouns that express the same idea can be formed by suffixing the third-person neuter pronoun to the present adjectival participle.

=== Inflecting verbs for non-finite forms (ಕ್ರಿಯಾಪದಗಳ ಅವ್ಯಯರೂಪಗಳಿಗೆ ರೂಪನಿಷ್ಪತ್ತಿ) ===

==== Present adverbial participle (ವರ್ತಮಾನಕಾಲದ ಕ್ರಿಯಾನ್ಯೂನ) ====

To form the present adverbial participle of a verb, add the suffix 'ಉತ್ತ' to the crude form of the verb.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There are no exceptions in the modern dialect, but occasionally the forms 'ಉತ' or 'ಉತ್ತಾ' may appear.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

	''ಮಾಡು (“do, make”) → ಮಾಡುತ್ತ (“doing, making”)''

	''ಬರೆ (“write”) → ಬರೆಯುತ್ತ (“writing”)''

==== Past adverbial participle (ಭೂತಕಾಲದ ಕ್ರಿಯಾನ್ಯೂನ) ====

To form the past adverbial participle of a verb that ends in “ಉ,” add the suffix “ಇ” to the crude form of the verb.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To form the past adverbial participle of a verb that ends in any vowel but “ಉ,” add the suffix “ದು” to the crude form of the verb.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

	''ಮಾಡು (“do, make”) → ಮಾಡಿ (“having done, having made”)''

	''ಬರೆ (“write”) → ಬರೆದು (“having written”)''	

There are many oddly formed past adverbial participles, some of them irregular, and some of them following old formations, and others changed for euphony. They are listed below:	

For these verbs, or any modern forms of them:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;	
* ಕವಲು
* ಮಡಲು
* ಬಲಿ
* ಕಲಿ
* ಹೋಲು
* ಸಾಲು
* ಸೋಲು
* ಹೇಲು
* ನೂಲು
* ಕೂರಿ
* ಕೊನರು
* ತಳಿರು
* ಚಿಗುರು
* ಬೆವರು
* ಅಳು
* ಉಳು
* ಕೀಳು
* ಚಳಿ
* ಮೊಳೆ
* ಅರಿ
* ಕುರಿ
* ಬಾ
* ಕೀ
suffix “ತು.”

Certain
final consonants
are replaced with other consonants before the “ದು” or the “ತು”
of the past participle.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Before 'ದು': 
ಲ್ →
ದ್; ಳ್ →
ದ್. Before
“ತು”: ಱ್ →
ತ್; 
ಱು
(in which the
final “ಉ”
was originally euphonic, as with the euphonic “ಉ”
for nouns) →
ತ್

The
following verbs’ past participles can be formed regularly, but there is also
another, irregular form of those verbs:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; ಆಗು
→ ಆಯ್; ಪೋಗು
→ ಪೋಯ್; 
ಹೋಗು
→ ಹೋಯ್

==== Present-future adjectival participle (ವರ್ತಮಾನಕಾಲದ ಮತ್ತು ಭವಿಷ್ಯತ್ತುಕಾಲದ ಕೃದ್ವಾಚಿ) ====

To form the present-future adjectival participle, add the suffix “ಉವ” to the crude form of the verb. There are not irregulars for this form in the modern dialect.

	''ಮಾಡು (“do, make) → ಮಾಡುವ (“who/which/that does, who/which/that makes”)''

	''ಬರೆ (“write”) → ಬರೆಯುವ (“who/which/that writes”)''

==== Past adjectival participle (ಭೂತಕಾಲದ ಕೃದ್ವಾಚಿ) ====

The past adjectival participle of the verb is formed from the past adverbial participle. If the past adverbial participle of a verb ends in 'ಉ', add 'ಅ' to the end of the past adverbial participle to form the past adjectival participle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the past adverbial participle of a verb ends in 'ಇ', add 'ದ' to the end of the past adverbial participle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Affirmative form (ನಿಶ್ಚಯರೂಪ) ====

To conjugate verbs in their present-tense affirmative form, attach the following suffixes to the present adverbial participle.
{| class="wikitable"
| 
| '''singular number''' 
| '''plural number'''
|-
| '''first person''' 
| ಏನೆ 
| ಏವೆ
|-

| ಆನೆ 
| ಆರೆ
|-
| '''third person feminine''' 
| ಆಳೆ 
| ಆರೆ
|-
| '''third person neuter''' 
| ಅದೆ 
| ಅವೆ
|}
To conjugate verbs in their past-tense affirmative form, attach the following suffixes to the past adjectival participle, except for the third person neuter singular suffix, which is attached to the past adverbial participle.
{| class="wikitable"
| 
| '''singular number'''

To conjugate verbs in their future-tense affirmative form, attach the following suffixes to the present-future adjectival participle.
{| class="wikitable"
| 
| '''singular number''' 
| '''plural number'''
|-
| '''first person''' 
| ಇನಿ 
| ಇವಿ

| ಆನೆ 
| ಆರೆ
|-
| '''third person feminine''' 
| ಆಳೆ 
| ಆರೆ
|-
| '''third person neuter''' 
| ಅತ್ತೆ 
| ಅತ್ತೆ
|}

==== Negative form (ನಿಷೇಧರೂಪ) ====

The negative form of the verb does not have any tense. Tense must be told from context. However, more commonly used to negate a verb is the negative word 'ಇಲ್ಲ'.

Suffix these terminations (which are the same as the future tense's suffixes) to the verbal infinitive that ends in "ಅ" for the tenseless negative form:
{| class="wikitable"
| 
| '''singular number''' 
| '''plural number'''
|-
| '''first person''' 
| ಎನು 
| ಎವು
|-
| '''second person''' 
| ಎ 
| ಇರಿ
|-
| '''third person masculine''' 
| ಅನು 
| ಅರು
|-
| '''third person feminine''' 
| ಅಳು 
| ಅರು
|-
| '''third person neuter''' 
| ಅದು 
| ಅವು
|}
The negative form has only the irregular formation that 'ಇಲ್ಲ' may be ''alternatively'' used in place of the regular negative forms of 'ಇರು'.

==== Contingent-future form (ಸಂಭಾವರೂಪ) ====

The contingent-future form expresses the idea that the action of a verb may perhaps occur in the future. For example, 'ಮಾಡಿಯೇನು', which is conjugated in the contingent-future form, may be translated as 'I ''might'' do (it)'.

These are the suffixes for the contingent-future form, suffixed to the past adverbial participle:
{| class="wikitable"
| 
| '''singular number''' 
| '''plural number'''
|-
| '''first person''' 
| ಏನು 
| ಏವು
|-
| '''second person''' 
| ಈಯೆ 
| ಈರಿ
|-
| '''third person masculine''' 
| ಆನು 
| ಆರು
|-
| '''third person feminine''' 
| ಆಳು 
| ಆರು
|-
| '''third person neuter''' 
| ಈತು 
| ಆವು
|}
The contingent-future form does not have irregular formations.

==== Imperative form (ವಿಧಿರೂಪ) ====

The imperative form of the verb optates, exhorts, or commands. For example, the first-person and the third-person imperative expresses the idea of 'may/let {I/we/he/she/it/they} ___'. However, the second-person imperative either is used either to command ('Do something!') or with an optative or jussive sense ('may you ___'), depending on the verb's meaning and the context.

These suffixes are attached to the root of the verb:
{| class="wikitable"
| 
| '''singular number''' 
| '''plural number'''
|-
| '''first person''' 
| ಉವೆ/ಅಲಿ 
| ಉವಾ/ಅಲಿ/ಓಣ
|-
| '''second person''' 
| Ø 
| ಇರಿ
|-
| '''third person masculine''' 
| ಅಲಿ 
| ಅಲಿ
|-
| '''third person feminine''' 
| ಅಲಿ 
| ಅಲಿ
|-
| '''third person neuter''' 
| ಅಲಿ 
| ಅಲಿ
|}
Below are the irregular imperative forms:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* second-person plural imperative 'ಇರಿ', from crude verb root 'ಇರು'
* second-person singular imperative 'ಕೋ', from crude verb root 'ಕೊಳ್ಳು'
* second-person singular imperative 'ಬೋ', from crude verb root 'ಬೋಲು'
* second-person plural imperative 'ತರಿ', from crude verb root 'ತರು'
* second-person singular imperative 'ತಾ', from crude verb root 'ತರು'
* second-person plural imperative 'ಬನ್ನಿರಿ', from crude verb root 'ಬರು'
* second-person singular imperative 'ಬಾ', from crude verb root 'ಬಾ'

=== Word order (ಪದವಿನ್ಯಾಸ) ===

Kannada word order is 'S-O-V', or 'subject-object-verb', as opposed to English, which is a 'S-V-O', or 'subject-verb-object' language. However, in Kannada, due to its highly inflected nature, a sentence's word order may be freely changed for style or emphasis.

=== Sentence constituents (ವಾಕ್ಯದ ಭಾಗಗಳು) ===

Kannada sentences have two basic parts: the subject and the predicate. The subject consists of the central topic of the sentence, declined to the nominative case, while the predicate consists of a verb, often with an object (which formally should be in the accusative case), ''or'' may have no verb and object at all but rather simply have another noun declined in the nominative case, known as the predicate nominative, where an equivalency statement is intended.

''Example: ನಾನು (subject) ಮೇಜನ್ನು (object) ಕಟ್ಟಿದೆನು (verb). ('I built the table.' Here, the subject is 'I' and 'built the table' is the predicate, with 'built' as the verb and 'the table' as the object.''

''&lt;nowiki&gt;Example: ನಾನು (subject) ಕನ್ನಡದ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಯು (predicate nominative). ('I (am) a student of Kannada.' Note that there is no direct Kannada equivalent for the verb 'to be' as a copula [linking verb], because Kannada is a zero-copula language, although the sentence may be alternatively written 'ನಾನು ಕನ್ನಡದ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿ(ಯನ್ನು) ಆಗಿದ್ಧೇನೆ.' literally meaning 'I am/exist having become a student of Kannada.'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''

==== Subject (ಕರ್ತೃ) ====

In Kannada, the subject is declined to the nominative case.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While the subject almost always performs the action in Kannada (use of the passive voice is highly rare), the subject may actually be the patient.

In a sentence with a subject, verb, and object, if the subject has already been made clear or is known from context, the subject may be omitted,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; with the predicate standing alone to make the sentence.

''Example: ಮನೆಗೆ ಹೋಗುವೆನು. ('I will go home.' Here, we can omit the subject 'ನಾನು', meaning 'I' because it is clear by the termination of the verb (a first-person singular termination, the same person and number of 'I') that the subject is 'I'.''

''Example:  ವಿನಯನು ಇವತ್ತು ವಿದ್ಯಾಲಯಕ್ಕೆ ಹೋಗಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಮನೆಗೆ ಬಂದನು. ('Vinay did not go to school today. {Vinay/he} came home.' In the second sentence, the subject 'Vinay' is omitted because it is clear from the previous sentence that the subject is 'Vinay'.)''

==== Verb ====

In Kannada, there cannot be more than one finite, or conjugated, verb in the sentence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, the sentence 'I went to school and came home.' cannot be literally translated into Kannada. The Kannada equivalent of that sentence would be 'Having gone to school, I came home.' In Kannada, adverbial participles must be used.

''Example: ನಾನು ವಿದ್ಯಾಲಯಕ್ಕೆ ಹೋಗಿ ಮನೆಗೆ ಬಂದೆನು. ('I, having gone to school, came home.' / 'I went to school and came home.')''

''Example: ನಾನು ಓಡಿ ಆಡುವೆನು. ('I, having run, will play.' / 'I will run and play.' Note that if the intention is to say that the two actions will happen simultaneously ('I will play as I run.') then the sentence would be written 'ನಾನು ಓಡುತ್ತ ಆಡುವೆನು.')''

==== Object (ಕರ್ಮ) ====

==== Dative construction (ಸಂಪ್ರದಾನಪದ ಕಾರ್ತೃವಾಗಿರುವ ವಾಕ್ಯ) ====

In Kannada, the [[dative construction]] is used often.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The dative construction occurs when the semantic subject is in the dative case and semantic direct object is in the nominative case. For example, in Kannada, one does not say 'I feel cold'; rather, one says the equivalent of 'cold is happening to me' ('ನನಗೆ ಚಳಿಯು ಆಗುತ್ತ ಇದೆ'). Similarly, one says 'dinner is wanted to me' ('ನನಗೆ ಉಟವು ಬೇಕು' or 'ನನಗೆ ಊಟವು ಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ'; the latter literally is broken apart 'ನನಗೆ ಊಟವು ಬೇಕಾಗಿ ಇದೆ', literally meaning 'to me, dinner has become wanted/needed').

Yet another example is the use with 'ಇಷ್ಟ'. For example, one says 'ನನಗೆ ಸೇಬುಗಳು ಇಷ್ಟ ಆಗುತ್ತವೆ' (idiomatically--'I like apples'; literally--'to me, apples become pleasure').

Dative constructions are used to make the equivalent of English sensory linking verbs and with many modal auxiliary verbs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, 'I see him' is translated as 'he causes me to see (him)', with 'me' in the dative case.

=== Interrogation (ಪ್ರಶ್ನಿಸುವುದು) ===

=== Negation (ನಿಷೇಧ) ===

==== Negative words (ನಿಷೇಧಾರ್ಥಕ ಪದಗಳು) ====

Kannada does ''not'' have any semantically negative words such as 'never', 'no one', and 'nothing'. These words are expressed by negating the verb with the positive equivalent of the negative word. For example, in Kannada, one cannot say 'students never go to school on Sundays'; one must say the equivalent of 'students do not go to school on Sundays ever' ('ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳು ಯಾವಾಗಾದರೂ ವಿದ್ಯಾಲಯಕ್ಕೆ ಭಾನವಾರಗಳ ಮೇಲೆ ಹೋಗುವದಿಲ್ಲ'). Similarly, for 'no one goes to school on Sundays', one says 'anyone does not go to school on Sundays' ('ಯರೂ ವಿದ್ಯಲಯಕ್ಕೆ ಭಾನವಾರಗಳ ಮೇಲೆ ಹೋಗುವದಿಲ್ಲ').

''Example:'' 'ಎಲ್ಲೂ ಆ ಘೋಷಣೆಯನ್ನು ಜನರು ಅಂಗೀಕರಿಸಲಿಕ್ಕಿಲ್ಲ.' ('Nowhere will the people accept that declaration.')

==== Negative finite verbs (ನಿಷೇಧಾರ್ಥಕ ಆಖ್ಯಾತಗಳು) ====

Although there is a negative 'mood' or form of the verb in Kannada, it is not used commonly anymore.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, the negative form does not express time distinctions, so [[Analytic language|analytic]] negative forms are employed.

There is no negative adverb like 'not' in Kannada. Analytic verb negation is very peculiar, and it employs a form of 'ಇರು' ('to be, exist'), which is 'ಇಲ್ಲ'. However, negative Kannada verbs with 'ಇಲ್ಲ' do not have personal terminations—they do not indicate the person, gender, or number of the subject.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

To form a past negative verb with 'ಇಲ್ಲ', suffix 'ಇಲ್ಲ' to the infinitive form of the verb ending in 'ಅಲ್'. To form a present negative verb with 'ಇಲ್ಲ', suffix 'ಇಲ್ಲ' to the verbal noun of the verb. To form a future negative verb, either use the present-tense negative form of the verb with 'ಇಲ್ಲ' or suffix 'ಇಲ್ಲ' to the infinitive form of the verb ending in 'ಅಲಿಕ್ಕೆ'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Aspect is expressed by 'ಇಲ್ಲ' in the normal way—by using a negative form of 'ಇರು' with an adverbial participle. For example, 'I will not have been being hit' is 'ಹೊಡಿಯಲ್ಪಡುತ್ತ ಇದ್ದು ಇರಲಿಕ್ಕಿಲ್ಲ'.

''Example:'' 'ಹೋಗುತ್ತ ಇರುವದಿಲ್ಲ.' ('I am not going.')

''Example:'' 'ಹೋಗಿ ಇರಲಿಲ್ಲ.' ('I had not gone.')

However, in the present tense, one can directly use 'ಇಲ್ಲ' after the participle to express aspect.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

''Example:'' 'ಹೋಗುತ್ತ ಇಲ್ಲ.' ('I am not going.')

''Example:'' 'ಹೋಗಿ ಇಲ್ಲ.' ('I have not gone.')

==== Negation of adverbial participles (ಕ್ರಿಯಾನ್ಯೂನಗಳ ನಿಷೇಧ) ====

Adverbial participles have a negative form, created by suffix 'ಅದೆ' to the crude form of the verb. This form is tenseless, and is best translated as 'without ___ing'. For example 'ನೋಡಿ ಹೋದೆನು' means 'I went having seen (it)', 'ನೋಡುತ್ತ ಹೋದೆನು' means 'seeing (it), I went' or 'I went seeing (it)', and 'ನೋಡದೆ ಹೋದೆನು' means 'I went not seeing (it)', "I went not having seen (it)', or 'I went without seeing (it)'.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

However, 'ಇಲ್ಲ', derived from 'ಇರು' has an adverbial participle form – 'ಇಲ್ಲದೆ' – and this can be used to keep tense when the adverbial participle must be negated. For example, one can say 'ನೋಡಿ ಇಲ್ಲದೆ' to definitively mean 'not having seen, and 'ನೋಡುತ್ತ ಇಲ್ಲದೆ' to definitively mean 'not seeing'.

'''Kildin Saami''' (also known by its other synonymous names '''''Saami''''', '''''Kola Saami''''', '''''Eastern Saami''''' and '''''Lappish'''''), is a Saami language that is spoken on the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia that today is and historically was once inhabited by this group. As social and cultural emphasis has been put on the writing and speaking of the various languages that constitute Russia, Kildin Saami has now become a critically endangered language.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rießler |first=Michael |title=Towards a digital infrastructure for Kildin Saami |url=http://www.siberian-studies.org/publications/PDF/sikriessler.pdf |year=2013 |journal=Sustaining Indigenous Knowledge: Learning Tools and community initiatives on preserving endangered languages and local cultural heritage, in SEC Publications.

{{legend|red|Kildin}} ('''K-5''' is Lovozero)
]]

The area around [[Lovozero (rural locality)|Lovozero]] has the highest concentration of speakers. It is the largest of the [[Eastern Sami languages]] by number of speakers. Its future, however, appears to be not as bright as that of [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]] or [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sami]] because the language is used actively by only very few people today. The Sami languages closest to Kildin are [[Ter Sami language|Ter Sami]] and [[Akkala Sami language|Akkala Sami]]. The latter is sometimes considered to be a dialect of Kildin Sami. Originally, Kildin Saami was spoken in the mainland areas with the largest pockets of these people in clustered areas and in the coastal parts of the Kola Peninsula.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kildin Saami speakers can be found in rural and urban areas, with one of them being in the administrative center of the Murmansk area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kildin Saami enclaves can be found throughout villages in Lovozero, Revda, Kola, Loparskaja, Teriberka, but can also be found in larger more sizable areas of Russia such as Olenegorsk and Apatity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilbur |first1=Joshua |last2=Rießler |first2=Michael |year=2013 |title=Språk og språkforhold i Sápmi: Documenting the endangered Kola Saami languages |journal=Band |volume=11 |url=http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/skandinavistik/11/riessler-michael-39/PDF/riessler.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blokland |first1=Rogier |last2=Rießler |first2=Michael |year=2011 |title=Komi-Saami–Russian contacts on the Kola peninsula |journal=Studies in Slavic and General Linguistics |pages=5–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovozero is known as the area where the Kildin Saami are dominantly present and where the language is still widely spoken amongst the small population: 700–800 ethnic Kildin Saami among a total village population of approximately 3,000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Today, the language has only about 100 active and perhaps 600 passive speakers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a result of relocation, migration, and forced movement of the group, the community has really fragmented and become divided over other areas in Russia, thus leading to an inability for the revival and sustenance of their language, traditions, customs, and beliefs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From a strictly geographical point of view, only Kildin and Ter, spoken on the Peninsula, should be regarded as Kola Saami.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==History==

===The early period ===
The Kildin Saami (Kola Saami) first came into contact and had more subsequent meetings with the Russians in the 12th century, when Pomor traders from the empire of Novgorod landed on the southern shores of the Kola Peninsula.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Russians themselves inhabited and set up shelters in the Kola and the Ter Coast as it was known then during the 13th–14th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pineda |first=David |year=2008 |title=Куэссь не получается сāмас, рyшас полегче”–codeswitching on the Kola Peninsula |journal=Poljarnyj vestnik |volume=11 |pages=47–62 |url=http://septentrio.uit.no/index.php/vestnik/article/viewFile/1301/1239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 15th and 16th centuries, Russians started heavily occupying and building their own communities in northern Karelia and increased exposure between the Kildin Saami and Russians naturally blossomed as a result.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the 19th century, Kola Saami were organized and advocated for themselves through "tight-knit familial communities" where they worked in pastures, lived by fishing, and survived through hunting all in a concrete set around defined territory with extended family.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wheelersburg |first1=Robert. P. |last2=Gutsol |first2=Natalia |year=2008 |title=Babinski and Ekostrovski: Saami pogosty on the western Kola Peninsula, Russia from 1880 to 1940 |journal=Arctic Anthropology |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=79–96 |jstor=40316703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, they community shared in spiritual customs and held similar ideologies on their language and community.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the Russian empire, the Kildin Saami had no authority, rights or privileges, or liberties of autonomy and independence to control their affairs and to educate and teach their language through schools.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kotljarchuk |first=Andrej |year=2012 |title=Kola Sami in the Stalinist Terror: A Quantitative Analysis |journal=Journal of Northern Studies |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=59–82 |url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:606912/FULLTEXT01.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1917 Revolution which overthrew the tsarist regime of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and led to the rise of the Bolsheviks, party systems, and emphasis towards a village-centered, peasant-centered, society, the Soviet state implemented laws or statutes that encouraged the development and protection of Saami language and Saami culture.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scheller |first=Elisabeth |year=2013 |title=Kola Sami language revitalisation — opportunities and challenges |journal=Humanistica Oerebroensia. Artes et linguae 16 |publisher=Örebro University |pages=392–421 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Stalinist era ===
During the 1930s, with an orientation toward Russian nationalism ("[[Russification]]") and Russian identity that came about more dramatically with Joseph Stalin's rise to power and his oppressive tactics, 20 years of repression, relocations, murders, and the extinguishment of certain languages came about, which had a quite negative influence on the Kola Sami languages and culture.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As Stalins' reign went on in Soviet Russia, his paranoia, frustrations, anger, and delusions grew, emotions he would act on as leader. Resistance and refusal to submit to the collectivized farms, villages and working conditions of the reindeer Kildin Saami community led to arrests by Stalin in the 1930s of those who lived in the Kola tundras.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As Russia entered World War II, Kildin Saami youth were drafted and impressed to serve in the Red Army, which lessened hardships and prejudices they faced for a temporary period.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although the repression ended after the death of Stalin in 1953, Russification policies continued and the work with the Sami languages started again only in the beginning of the 1980s when new teaching materials and dictionaries were published.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Opportunities and challenges for the Kildin Sami==
===Opportunities ===
There is an opportunity to revitalize, reintegrate, and have Kildin Sami be more widely spoken such as reintroducing and raising awareness and support for Kildin Saami as an everyday language for communication—like in the Saami community of Lovozero.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Youth and adolescents are expressing more interest now to speak Kildin Saami which can help in the languages survival.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A sizable portion of political and cultural Kildin Saami groups are pushing for policies and local measures that help to maintain and protect Saami tradition, which is important if the language is to survive the test of time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The federal Russian legislation guarantees the Sami several legal rights giving them language sovereignty and rights to use and develop their languages.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; But for the practical realization of these rights the Kola Sami community needs to hold a constant constructive dialogue with the municipal and regional authorities, which have expressed their willingness to cooperate with the Sami in the development of the Sami language and culture.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Challenges ===
A majority of children hold no knowledge of their languages, traditions, customs, or beliefs, and have had no formal or informal teaching which may give them a base of knowledge from which to work from.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Antiquated materials, ineffective or inaccessible resources, and old teaching methods are often used to teach the language; there is no efforts towards the transmission of the language to future generations nor is there an active effort to preserve written language for scholarly use or to build opportunities to learn Kildin Saami at higher levels.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Although authorities and some government officials express a desire and willingness to resuscitate and revitalize the language, the community is not using that to their advantage, either because they do not know how to do so or who to reach out to.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There is no collaboration or team effort from language activists, language experts and language users and no coordinated or organized process to make learning the Kildin Saami language a reality for more people.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A language center or another initiative to carry out a more coordinated and well-planned language work could solve that problem.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Writing system==
{{main|Kildin Sami orthography}}

Kildin Sami is written in an extended version of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] since the 1980s. The alphabet has three variants with some minor differences in certain letters, mostly in '''Ҋ''' vs. '''Ј''' and '''’''' (apostrophe) vs. '''Һ'''. Whereas the dictionary of Sammallahti/Khvorostukhina(1991) uses '''Ҋ''' and '''’''' (apostrophe), Kuruč at al. 1985 uses '''Ј''' and '''Һ'''. The third orthographic variant, used, e.g. by Kert (1986), has neither of these letters.

Note that the letters '''Ӓ''', '''Ҋ'''/'''Ј''', '''Һ'''/'''’''' (apostrophe), '''Ӆ''', '''Ӎ''', '''Ӊ''', '''Ӈ''', '''Ҏ''', '''Ъ''', '''Ь''', '''Ҍ''' and '''Ӭ''' do not occur word initially, either because the letters mark features of preceding consonants or the sounds they represent do not occur word initially. So these letters do not normally occur in uppercase, except for [[all caps]] text.

The letter '''Щ''' occurs only in Russian [[loanword]]s.

The orthographic principles are more or less similar to Russian, but note the following special features.

===Palatalization ===
Similar to Russian, palatalization of a consonant in Kildin Sami is marked by the letter [[Ь]] or one of the vowel letters '''Е''', '''Ё''', '''И''', '''Ю''', and '''Я''' following the consonant. Palatalized Д, Т, Н, however, are marked by [[semisoft sign|ҍ]] or one of the vowel letters '''Ӓ''' and '''Ӭ'''. Note also that the consonant letter Н before [[Ь]] or one of the vowel letters '''Е''', '''Ё''', '''И''', '''Ю''', and '''Я''' does not represent palatalization but the palatal nasal {{IPA|/ɲ/}}.

===Long vowels ===
Long vowels are marked with a [[macron (diacritic)|macron]] {{Angbr|¯}} over the vowel letter (and above the [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] in the cases of Ё).

===Preaspiration ===
The letter '''Һ''' occurs before the letters '''П''', '''Т''', '''К''', '''Ц''' and '''Ч''', and marks (historical) [[preaspiration]]. The actual pronunciation, however, varies between true preaspiration {{IPA|[ʰ]}} or the fricative sounds {{IPA|[h]}}, {{IPA|[ç]}}, or {{IPA|[x]}}.

===Voiceless sonorants ===
Voiceless sonorants are represented by the letters '''Ҋ'''/'''Ј''', '''Ӆ''', '''Ӎ''', '''Ӊ''', and '''Ҏ'''.

===Velar nasal===
The velar nasal is written as '''Ӈ'''.

==Phonology==
Below are all of the consonants in Kildin Sami. The symbols in parenthesis are minimal sounds.

== Grammar ==

=== Negation ===
In Kildin Saami negation is formed by a syntagma, which consists of a finite negative auxiliary and a finite main verb in a special case called "connegative" (negative form of the main verb). The negative auxiliary gets inflected by person, number and mood. The connegative is a case for the main verb in a negative clause. The tense (whether present or past) is marked by the main verb in a negative clause. The negative auxiliary has the same form in all tenses.

This is the inflectional paradigm of the negative auxiliary:

Negative clause in present tense&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Clausal complementation in Kildin, North and Skolt Saami|last=Kotcheva|first=Kristina|last2=Rießler|first2=Michael|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|year=2016|isbn=|location=Berlin|pages=499-528|doi=10.1515/9783110416619-015a}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
 Mun   emm     t'ēd'   koal'e   Evvan   li   puadtma.&lt;br /&gt;I     I.not   know    koal'e   Ivan    is   come.&lt;br /&gt;"I don't know if/whether Ivan has come."
Negative clause in present tense:
 Sōnn   ejj       t'ēdtma   koal'e   sōnn   jo        ujjtma    li.&lt;br /&gt;s/he   s/he.not  knew.cn   koal'e   s/he   already   gone      is&lt;br /&gt;"S/he didn't know that s/he was already gone.'
With the negation of the verb "to be" in the third person it comes to an amalgamation of the main verb and the negative auxiliary:

''ell'a'' = "is not", compound of ''ejj'' (3. pers. sg. negative auxiliary) and ''lea'' (connegative, present, main verb: "to be")

''jievla'' = "are not", compound of ''jiev'' (3. pers. pl. negative auxiliary) and ''lea'' (connegative, present, main verb: "to be")

''ell'ij'' = "was not", compound of ''ejj'' (3. pers. sg. negative auxiliary) and ''liijja'' (connegative, past, main verb: "to be")

In the third person plural of the past tense there is no amalgamation of the negative auxiliary and the main verb "to be":

''jiev liijja'' = "were not", compound of ''jiev'' (3. pers. pl. negative auxiliary) and ''liijja'' (connegative, past, main verb: "to be")

Negative indefinite pronouns are formed with the negative prefix ''ni-''. It is the only prefix in Kildin Saami and is borrowed from the Russian language. The prefix ''ni-'' can get used with all interrogative pronouns. The negative indefinite pronouns can stay in different cases. Some examples are&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kildin Saami|last=Rießler|first=Michael|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|year=2007|isbn=|location=Berlin|pages=229-244|doi=10.1515/9783110199192.229}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

''ni-k'ē'' Neg-who? nominative, singular "nobody"

''ni-k'ējn'' Neg-who? comitative, singular "with nobody"

''ni-k'ēnn'' Neg-who? genitive, singular "nobody's"

''ni-mī'' Neg-what? nominative, singular "nothing"

''ni-mēnn'' Neg-what? accusative, singular "nothing"
 ni-mēnn    munn   emm     ujn&lt;br /&gt;what.not   I      I.not   see&lt;br /&gt;"I don't see anything."

==Loanwords to English==
{{see also|List of English words of Sami origin}}

The word ''[[tundra]]'' has been borrowed to English, via Russian. In Kildin Sami, {{lang|sjd|тӯндар}} (''{{lang|sjd-Latn|tūndâr}}'') means "treeless plain", but its [[genitive case]] is {{lang|sjd|тӯндра}} (''{{lang|sjd-Latn|tūndra}}'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="980">A '''limber hole''' is a drain hole through a frame or other structural member of a boat designed to prevent water from accumulating against one side of the frame, and allowing it to drain toward the [[bilge]].  Limber holes are common in the bilges of wooden boats.  The term may be extended to cover drain holes in floors. Limber holes are created in between [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s so that one compartment does not fill with water.  The limber holes allow water to drain into the lowest part of the bilge so that it can be pumped out by a single [[bilge pump]] (or more usually, one electric and one manual pump).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2435">'''Luís Bernado Honwana''' (born 1942) is a [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] author.

==Biography==
Luís Bernardo Honwana was born Luís Augusto Bernardo Manuel in Lourenço Marques (present-day [[Maputo]]), Mozambique. His parents, Raúl Bernardo Manuel (Honwana) and Naly Jeremias Nhaca, belonged to the [[Ronga language|Ronga]] people from Moamba, a town about 55&amp;nbsp;km northwest of Maputo. In 1964 he became a militant with [[FRELIMO]], a front that had the objective to liberate Mozambique from Portuguese colonial rule. Due to his political activities he was arrested by the colonial authorities and was incarcerated for three years.

He studied law in [[Portugal]] and worked for some time as a journalist. He was appointed director of President's office under [[Samora Machel]]. Later in 1981, he became Secretary of State for culture. He served on the Executive Board of [[UNESCO]] from 1987 to 1991 and was chairman of UNESCO's Intergovernmental Committee for the World Decade for Culture and Development. In 1995, he was appointed director of the newly opened UNESCO office in South Africa. Since he retired from the organization in 2002, he has been active in research in the arts, history and ethno-linguistics. &lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=20292&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Luís Bernardo Honwana] at Unesco.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Honwana is the author of a single book, ''Nós Matámos o Cão-Tinhoso'' (1964), translated into English as ''[[We Killed Mangy Dog and Other Stories]]'', and the tale "Hands of the Blacks". This work has proved enormously influential and a case can be made for it being the touchstone of contemporary Mozambican narrative. ''We Killed Mangy Dog'' is a collection of short stories set in the (Portuguese) colonial era at the turn of the sixties and is reflective of the harsh life black Mozambicans lived under the [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar regime]]. Several of the stories are told from the point of view of children or alienated adolescents and most feature the rich mix of races, religions and ethnicities that would later preoccupy Mozambique's most internationally celebrated writer, [[Mia Couto]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8747">'''Manual babbling''' is a [[linguistic]] phenomenon that has been observed in [[deaf]] children and children born to deaf parents and appears at the early stages of [[language acquisition]]. It is characterized by repetitive movements that are confined to a limited area in front of the body similar to the sign-phonetic space used in [[sign languages]].&lt;ref name="Petitto2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Petitto LA, Holowka S, Sergio LE, Ostry D |title=Language rhythms in baby hand movements |journal=Nature |volume=413 |issue=6851 |pages=35–6 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11544514 |doi=10.1038/35092613 |url=http://www.yorku.ca/lsergio/petitto_nature_2001.pdf |accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their 1991 paper, Pettito and Marantette concluded that between 40% and 70% of deaf children's hand movements can be classified as manual [[babbling]].&lt;ref name="MarscharkSpencer2011"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Marc|last1=Marschark|first2=Patricia Elizabeth|last2=Spencer|title=The Oxford Handbook of Deaf Studies, Language, and Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Md9gDfsxYgC&amp;pg=PA230|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=11 January 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-975098-6|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PetittoMarentette1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petitto|first1=L.|last2=Marentette|first2=P.|title=Babbling in the manual mode: evidence for the ontogeny of language|journal=Science|volume=251|issue=5000|year=1991|pages=1493–1496|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.2006424|url=http://pages.pomona.edu/~rt004747/lgcs123read/PetittoMarentette91.pdf|accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All infants are equipped to detect rhythmic patterns and properties of the linguistic input they receive. Where [[hearing]] children are triggered by the sound patterns they hear, [[deaf]] children are more attentive to the movement patterns they see.&lt;ref name=PetittoMarentette1991 /&gt; In other words, vocal babbling is triggered by patterns of the spoken linguistic environment, and manual babbling is triggered by patterns of a signed linguistic environment.&lt;ref&gt;Cormier, K., Mauk, C., &amp; Repp, A. (1998). Manual babbling in deaf and hearing Infants: A longitudinal study. In Proceedings of the Twenty-ninth Annual Child Language Research Forum (pp. 55-61). Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, still leaves room for non-hearing children to piece together what these movements are and what they mean. Because of this lack of clarity, non-hearing infants explore manual gestures like a hearing child may explore phonemes. Petitto and Marentette researched the difference between the manual babbling used by hearing and non-hearing infants, and they discovered that non-hearing babies produce more different kinds of manual babbles than hearing infants do. However, there was not a significant difference between the frequency of communicative gestures between hearing and non-hearing infants.&lt;ref name=PetittoMarentette1991 /&gt;
The difference between manual babbling and signed syllables is that while signed syllables are language-driven, manual babbling is centered on hand shape, location, and movement. In other words, instead of being language-driven, manual babbling is motor-driven.

== Development ==
When an infant is beginning to develop a means of communication, it is often also trying to get a sense of their spatial orientation and [[cognition]]. This means that there will be arm and hand movements outside of what could be categorized as manual babbling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cormier|first1=Kearsy|last2=Mauk|first2=Claude|last3=Repp|first3=Ann|title=Manual Babbling in Deaf and Hearing Infants: A Longitudinal Study|journal=Proceedings of the Twenty-ninth Annual Child Language Research Forum|date=1998|pages=55–61|url=http://kearsy.macmate.me/web/Publications_files/CormierMaukRepp1998.pdf|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when an infant is waving their arm back and forth, they may be transitioning between uncoordinated behaviors and intentional, voluntary behaviors like reaching. The frequency of these arm and hand gestures peaks between 5 and a half months and 9 and a half months, which is the same developmental point as vocal development.

== Differences from ASL ==
In 1995, Meier and Willerman defined the three primary manual gestures as pointing, reaching, and waving, so anything beyond those three could be categorized as manual babbles. Common babbles by this definition include arm waves, body pats, and claps. Common communicative gestures, which are different from babbles because they carry meaning, include reaches, points, conventional waves, and rituals (like [[patty cake]]). 
Identification of manual babbling references [[American Sign Language phonology]]. This means that the babbles have hand shapes, a general place of articulation, movement, and palm orientation.&lt;ref name=PetittoMarentette1991 /&gt;

==Supporting evidence==
Adrianne Cheek, Kearsy Cormier, Christian Rathmarm, Ann Repp, and Richard Meier did testing that yielded similarities between babbles and first signs. The analysis of properties of babbles and signs showed that in hand shape, all infants produced a relaxed hand with all fingers extended more often than any other hand shape; the same held for deaf infants in first signs. For movement, infants displayed downward movements more often for babbles and signs than any other movement category.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheek|first1=Adrianne|last2=Cormier|first2=Kearsy|last3=Rathmann|first3=Christian|last4=Repp|first4=Ann|last5=Meier|first5=Richard|title=Motoric Constraints Link Manual Babbling and Early Signs|journal=Infant Behavior and Development|date=April 1998|volume=21|page=340|doi=10.1016/s0163-6383(98)91553-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the relationship between the hands, babies demonstrated a preference for one-handed babbles over two-handed ones. Deaf babies maintained this preference by producing more one-handed signs than two-handed ones. For palm orientation, subjects predominately babbled or signed with palms down.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Kearsy Cormier, Claude Mauk, and Ann Repp conducted an observational study of the natural behaviors of hearing and deaf infants. They opted to utilize a more global approach to manual babbling in their coding, as suggested by Meier and Willerman. Their two goals are as follows: (1) Determine when manual babbling in deaf and hearing infants during their respective developmental timelines; and (2) Analyze how manual babbling and the onset of communicative gestures are related. The results support the predictions and claims made previously by Meier and Willerman since it was found most of early gestural behavior is a result of motor development in addition to linguistic influences. In addition, deaf children usually produced more referential gestures, specifically referential pointing, than hearing children, which could be caused by their distinct linguistic environments. For instance, points become essential for deaf children learning sign. On the contrary, for hearing children, points will always be added gestures that are not necessary to the spoken language.The study concludes that, while the child’s early communicative gestures are partially determined by linguistic environment, manual babbling is mainly influenced by motor development, which is the same for both deaf and hearing children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cormier, Mauk, Repp|first=Kearsy, Claude, Ann|date=|title=Manual babbling in deaf and hearing Infants: A longitudinal study|url=http://kearsy.macmate.me/web/Publications_files/CormierMaukRepp1998.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Twenty-ninth Annual Child Language Research Forum|volume=|pages=55–61|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence that manual babbling resembles the babbling of hearing children and allows for further communication through sign. As the deaf infant develops, the cyclic increase in manual babble leads to making different handshapes used in sign, such the 5 hand, C hand, and S hand in early babbling. These handshapes become more significant since they allow for the reception of the caretaker’s child-directed signing. The infant soon begins to notice that they are making these handshapes in a manner analogous to how infants with hearing parents listen to speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seal|first=Brenda C.|last2=DePaolis|first2=Rory A.|date=2014-09-05|title=Manual Activity and Onset of First Words in Babies Exposed and Not Exposed to Baby Signing|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/553407|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=14|issue=4|pages=444–465|doi=10.1353/sls.2014.0015|issn=1533-6263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3259">'''Menachem Mendel Lefin''' (also '''Menahem Mendel Levin''') (1749–1826) was an early leader of the [[Haskalah]] movement.  

==Biography==
He was born in [[Satanov]], [[Podolia]], where he had a traditional Jewish education supplemented by studies in science, mathematics, and medieval philosophy.  In the early 1780s he lived in Berlin, where he met [[Moses Mendelssohn]] and other Haskalah leaders. He was later introduced to Prince [[Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski]], and became a tutor to Czartoryski's children in [[Podolia]]. He spent most of his life living in Galicia, and had great influence on [[Nachman Krochmal]] and [[Joseph Perl]]. He is widely regarded as the "father of the Galician [[Haskalah]]."&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein, Avraham  (2007). "Levin (Lefin), Menahem Mendel." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. 2nd ed. Vol. 12. p.&amp;nbsp;710-711.&lt;/ref&gt; He campaigned in favor of adding general education to the standard curriculum in Jewish schools, and he was a fierce opponent of the [[Hasidic]] movement and the [[Kabbalah]], which he viewed as "nonsense." Among his influential works is a [[Musar Literature|Musar text]] titled ''Cheshbon Ha-Nefesh'' (Moral Accounting), which was published in 1809, based in part on the ethical program described in the autobiography of [[Benjamin Franklin#Virtue|Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;Sinkoff, Nancy (2004).

A '''Minister of Everything''', sometimes also called '''Minister for Everything''', refers to a Minister who wields great and wide-reaching power in the government, usually as the head of a powerful and influential ministry (often a "super ministry" combining two or more portfolios), but also can influence government machinery outside his direct control. The title is unofficial, and often assigned by the media or other political figures. Ministers who are seen as holding the title are often regarded as the second most powerful person in the government after the head of government, and often (but not always) this position is cemented by holding the official title of Deputy Prime Minister/Deputy Premier/Deputy First Minister etc. The term can also be used as a criticism of heads of government who take a more hands on approach in governing and give ministers less independence, or a head of government who hold additional powerful cabinet portfolios.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3716">[[Image:Russia 1918 CPA 1 stamp (Hand with a Sword Splitting a Chain against a Rising Sun).jpg|right|thumb|This mint stamp of the 1918 Russian revolution era is much less commonly found used.]][[File:Ceylon 100R stamp.jpg|right|thumb|A mint high value 100 Rupee [[key type stamp]] of Ceylon valid for postage or revenue use and vulnerable to tampering to remove a [[fiscal cancel]] to make it appear to be a more valuable unused stamp.]]

In [[philately]], a '''mint stamp''' is one which is in its original state of issue, is unused, has never been mounted and has full [[postage stamp gum|gum]], if issued with gum.&lt;ref name=mack&gt;[[James A. Mackay|Mackay, James]]. ''Stamp Collecting: Philatelic Terms Illustrated''. 4th edition. London: Stanley Gibbons, 2003, p.88. {{ISBN|0-85259-557-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yng&gt;Youngblood, Wayne L. ''All about Stamps''. Iola WI: Krause Publications, 2000, p.109. {{ISBN|0-87341-963-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term applies equally to [[postage stamps]] and [[revenue stamp]]s.

In practice, the term is used within philately to refer to any stamp that appears to be unused, including those without gum, or previously [[stamp hinge|hinged]].

Unlike other collectibles, a mint stamp may be in poor condition but still be regarded as being in ''mint state'' as long as it is apparently unused.

== Variations ==
Variations of the term ''mint'' include:
*Mint hinged (MH) – the stamp is unused but has been previously hinged. Remains of the hinge or gum disturbance are visible.
*Mounted mint (MM) – the same as Mint hinged.
*Mint no gum (MNG) – the stamp appears to be unused but has no gum. It might have been used but not cancelled, or have been issued without gum.
*Unmounted mint (UM) – the stamp is unused and appears never to have been mounted.
*Mint never hinged (MNH) – the same as unmounted mint but with an assertion that the stamp is not a formerly mounted stamp that has been tampered with to remove traces of mounting.
The hinging referred to in these terms is mounting of the stamp in a [[stamp album]] by the application of a [[stamp hinge]] to the back of the stamp. The highest grade is ''unmounted mint'' or ''mint never hinged''. The term ''mint never hinged'' has developed to provide reassurance to buyers that the stamp has not been tampered with to remove traces of mounting, as the term ''unmounted mint'' was thought to be ambiguous.

== Value ==
Mint stamps are often more valuable than used stamps as in many cases fewer mint stamps survive. A mint stamp may also be in better condition than a used stamp which has passed through the mail. Sometimes, however, used stamps may be more valuable than mint ones where higher numbers of mint stamps have survived, perhaps because large numbers of mint stamps were bought by collectors but few used on letters.&lt;ref name=murr&gt;Robert Murray, [http://www.stamp-shop.com/used-or-unused-stamps.html "Are Used or Unused Stamps Worth More?"]. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Tampering ==
Differences between mint and used values for the same stamp have led to a small industry in removing, or adding, postal cancellations to stamps. Another common practice is to attempt to remove fiscal cancellations, which are often [[pen cancels]], in order to change a stamp used fiscally (for tax purposes) to one apparently unused. Stamps available for both postage and revenue (fiscal) purposes are usually worth more unused or with a postal cancellation. [[Madame Joseph]] specialised in the addition of forged cancels to stamps that were worth more used than unused.

'''Oophagy''' ({{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|ɒ|f|ə|dʒ|i}} {{respell|oh|OFF|ə-jee}}) sometimes '''ovophagy''', literally "egg eating", is the practice of [[embryos]] feeding on eggs produced by the [[ovary]] while still inside the mother's [[uterus]]. The word oophagy is formed from the [[classical Greek]] ᾠόν (ōion, egg) and classical Greek φᾱγεῖν (phāgein, to eat).  In contrast, [[Cannibalism (zoology)#Intrauterine cannibalism|adelphophagy]] is the cannibalism of a multi-celled embryo.

Oophagy is thought to occur in all [[shark]]s in the order [[Lamniformes]] and has been recorded in the [[bigeye thresher]] (''Alopias superciliosus''), the [[pelagic thresher]] (''A. pelagicus''), the [[shortfin mako]] (''Isurus oxyrinchus'') and the [[porbeagle shark|porbeagle]] (''Lamna nasus'') among others.&lt;ref name="EFMT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/organizations/ssg/EFMT/7.pdf|title=Elasmobranch Fisheries Management Techniques Chapter 7|author=Christina L. Conrath|accessdate={{date|2006-08-03}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also occurs in the [[tawny nurse shark]] (''Nebrius ferrugineus''), and in the family [[Pseudotriakidae]].

This practice may lead to larger embryos or prepare it for a predatory lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Wourms, J. P. (1981) ''Viviparity: The maternal-fetal relationship in fishes''. Am. Zool. 21:473-515.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are variations in the extent of oophagy among the different shark species. The [[grey nurse shark]] (''Carcharias taurus'') practices intrauterine cannibalism, the first developed embryo consuming both additional eggs and any other developing embryos. [[Slender smooth-hound]]s
(''Gollum attenuatus''), form egg capsules which contain 30-80 ova within which only one ovum develops while all other ova  are ingested and packed to an external yolk sac. The embryo then develops normally without ingesting further eggs.&lt;ref name="EFMT" /&gt;

Oophagy is also used to refer to more general egg-eating behaviours such as those practised by some [[snakes]]. Similarly, the term can be used to describe the destruction of non-queen eggs in nests of certain social wasps, bees, and ants. This is seen in the wasp species ''[[Polistes|Polistes biglumis]]'' and ''[[Polistes humilis]]''.&lt;ref name = Spring&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=October 9, 2014 |date= June 25, 1986 |title=Spring Behaviour of an Australian Paper Wasp, Polistes humilis synoecus : Colony Founding by Haplometrosis and Utilization of Old Nests|url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110003502326/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oophagy has been observed in ''[[Leptothorax acervorum]]'' and ''[[Parachartergus fraternus]]'', where oophagy is practiced to increase energy circulation and consume more protein.&lt;ref&gt;Mateus, Sidnei, Fernando Barbosa Noll, and Ronaldo Zucchi.

'''Pennsylvania German''' ({{lang|pdc|Deitsch}}, ''Pennsylvania {{lang|pdc|Deitsch|italic=unset}}'', {{lang|pdc|Pennsilfaanisch Deitsch}}, Hinterwäldler Deutsch, {{Audio|GT Penn German.ogg|listen}}; often called '''Pennsylvania Dutch''') is a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of [[West Central German]] spoken by the [[Amish|Old Order Amish]], [[Old Order Mennonites]] and other descendants of German immigrants in the United States and Canada, closely related to the [[Palatine German language|Palatine dialects]]. There are possibly more than 300,000 native speakers in the United States and [[Canada]]. In [[Pennsylvania]] 29.9% of the population currently claim to have German ancestry.

It has traditionally been the dialect of the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]], descendants of late 17th- and early to late 18th-century immigrants to Pennsylvania, [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]] and [[North Carolina]] from southern Germany, eastern France ([[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]), and Switzerland. Although for many, the term "Pennsylvania Dutch" is often taken to refer to the [[Amish]] and related [[Old Order Movement|Old Order]] groups exclusively, the term should not imply a connection to any particular religious group.

In this context, the word "Dutch" does not refer to the [[Dutch people]] or their descendants. Historically, it has been accepted that the "Dutch" in Pennsylvania Dutch is a corruption or "folk-rendering" of the Pennsylvania German [[endonym]] {{lang|pdc|Deitsch}}.&lt;ref&gt;Hostetler, John A. (1993), ''Amish Society'', The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/pennsylvaniagerman.htm|title=Pennsylvania German language, alphabet and pronunciation|author=|date=|website=www.omniglot.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An alternative theory is that it is left over from an archaic sense of the [[English language|English]] word "Dutch"; compare German {{lang|de|Deutsch}} ('German'), Dutch {{lang|nl|Duits}} ('German'), {{lang|nl|Diets}} ('Dutch'), which once referred to any people speaking a non-peripheral continental [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] on the European mainland.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, Kyle R. (2006), "Meet Don Yoder, Dean of Folklife Scholars", ''Pennsylvania Heritage'', vol. 32, no. 2, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

Speakers of the dialect today are primarily found in Pennsylvania, [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], and other [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern states]] of the [[United States]], and in [[Ontario]] in [[Canada]]. Historically, the dialect was also spoken in several other regions where its use has either largely or entirely faded. The practice of Pennsylvania German as a street language in urban areas of Pennsylvania (such as Allentown, Reading, Lancaster, and York) was declining by the arrival of the 20th century, while in more rural areas it continued in widespread use through the World War II era. Since that time, its use has greatly declined. The exception to this decline is in the context of the Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonite communities, and presently the members of these two groups make up the majority of Pennsylvania German speakers {{crossref|printworthy=y|(see "Survival", below)}}.

== European origins ==
[[File:Rheinfrankisch.png|right|thumb|300px|Area where Rhine Franconian is spoken. 1 [[Hessian dialects|Hessian]], 2 [[Palatine German language|Palatinate German]] 3 [[Lorraine Franconian]]]]

The ancestors of Pennsylvania German speakers came from various parts of the southwest corner of the German-speaking region of Europe, mainly the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]], but also including the [[Electoral Palatinate]] ({{lang-de|Kurpfalz}}), the [[Duchy of Baden]], [[Swabia]], [[Württemberg]], [[Alsace]] (German {{lang|de|Elsass}}), [[German Lorraine]], and [[Switzerland]]. Most of them spoke [[Rhine Franconian]], especially [[Palatine German language|Palatinan]] and to a lesser degree [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] dialects, and it is believed that in the first generations after the settlers arrived these dialects merged.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The result of that [[dialect levelling]] was a dialect very close to the eastern dialects of [[Palatine German language|Palatinian]], especially the rural dialects around [[Mannheim]]/[[Ludwigshafen]].

== Modern Palatine German ==
When individuals from the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate ''(Pfalz)'']] region of Germany encounter Pennsylvania German speakers today, conversation is often possible to a limited degree. There are many similarities between the German dialect that is still spoken in this small part of southwestern Germany and Pennsylvania German. There are approximately 2,400,000 Germans in [[Rhein Neckar Area|Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region]] (a region almost identical to the historical Palatinate) speaking [[Palatine German language|Palatinate German]], the specific German dialect from which the "Pennsylvania German" is mainly derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Writing in Pennsylvania German ==
Pennsylvania German has primarily been a spoken dialect throughout its history, with very few of its speakers making much of an attempt to read or write it. Writing in Pennsylvania German can be a difficult task, and there is no spelling standard for the dialect. There are currently two primary, competing models which numerous orthographic (i.e., spelling) systems have been based upon by individuals attempting to write in the Pennsylvania German dialect. One 'school' tends to follow the rules of American English orthography, the other the rules of Standard German orthography.  The choice of writing system is not meant to imply any difference in pronunciation.  For comparison, a translation into Pennsylvania German, using two different spelling systems, of the [[Lord's Prayer]], as found in the Anglican [[Book of Common Prayer]], is presented below. The text in the second column illustrates a system based on American English orthography. The text in the third column uses, on the other hand, a system based on Standard German. The English original is found in the first column, and a [[Standard German]] version appears in the fifth column. (Note: The German version(s) of the Lord's Prayer most likely to have been used by Pennsylvania Germans would have been derived in most cases from Martin Luther's translation of the New Testament.)

== Publications ==

Since 1997, the Pennsylvania German newspaper ''[[Hiwwe wie Driwwe]]''&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Michael (ed.) Hiwwe wie Driwwe. http://hiwwewiedriwwe.wordpress.com/&lt;/ref&gt; allows dialect authors (of whom there are still about 100) to publish Pennsylvania German poetry and prose. ''Hiwwe wie Driwwe'' was founded by [[Michael Werner (publisher)|Michael Werner]]. It is published twice a year (2,400 copies per issue) - since 2013 in cooperation with the Pennsylvania German Cultural Heritage Center at [[Kutztown University]]. Since 2002, the newspaper is published [[Hiwwe wie Driwwe|both online and in print]]. 

In 2006, the German publishing house "Edition Tintenfaß" started to print books in Pennsylvania German.

In 2014, Jehovah's Witnesses began to publish literature in Pennsylvania German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jw.org/pdc/publications/bichah/|title=Online Bichah es Dich Helft di Bivvel Shtodya|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with Standard German ==
Pennsylvania German for the most part does not reflect the origins of the early speakers from different regions along the upper [[Rhine]] River ([[Rhineland]], [[Württemberg]], [[Baden]], [[Saarland]], [[Switzerland]] and the Elsass/[[Alsace]]) but almost exclusively the strong immigrant group from the Palatine.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Rudolf Post: ''Pfälzisch. Einführung in eine Sprachlandschaft''. [[Landau]], 1990, page 44.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pennsylvania German is not a corrupted form of [[Standard German]], since Standard German evolved as an archaic — and for a long time artificial — [[koiné language]] in a very long process that started in the time of classical [[Middle High German]] (1170–1250), see [[Standard German#Origins|Standard German: Origins]]. Pennsylvania German instead reflects the independent development of Palatine German, especially from the region that is called {{lang|de|Vorderpfalz}} in German.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

Several vowel and consonant in Pennsylvania German represent older forms of the German language, e.g. "p" instead of "pf" or "v" instead of "b", while Standard German consonants shifted. They only appear as shifts if Standard German is erroneously seen as the basis from which Pennsylvania German evolved. The correspondence between Standard German and Pennsylvania German occur with a fair degree of regularity. 

The American English influence is most significant on vocabulary&lt;ref&gt;Helga Seel: ''Lexikologische Studien zum Pennsylvaniadeutschen: Wortbildung des Pennsylvaniadeutschen''. Stuttgart, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; and to a much lesser degree on pronunciation; the English influence on grammar is relatively small. The question of whether the large loss of the [[dative case]] — the most significant difference compared with Palatine German — is due to English influence or reflects an inner development, is disputed.

=== Grammar ===
As in Standard German, Pennsylvania German uses three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter). Pronouns inflect into three or four cases, while in Standard German always four cases. Concerning the  article, the nominative and accusative merged, and the dative is mostly lost. As in all other German dialects,{{clarify|date=March 2018}} the genitive is lost and often replaced by a special construction using the dative and the possessive pronoun:  "the man's dog" becomes {{lang|pdc|em Mann sei Hund}} (literally: "to the man his dog"). In most regions, the dative has been gradually replaced by the accusative, so that {{lang|pdc|em Mann sei Hund}}, for example, has frequently become {{lang|pdc|der Mann sei Hund}}.

Adjectival endings exist, but appear simplified compared to [[Standard German]]. As in all other South German dialects, the past tense is generally expressed using the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]]: {{lang|pdc|Ich bin ins Feld glaafe}} ("I have run into the field") and not the simple past ({{lang|de|Ich lief ins Feld}} ["I ran into the field"]), which is only retained in the verb "to be", as {{lang|pdc|war}} or {{lang|pdc|ware}}, corresponding to English "was" and "were". The [[Subjunctive mood]] is only extant as {{lang|de|Konjunktiv I}} ({{lang|de|Konjunktiv II}} is totally lost){{clarify|date=March 2018}} in a limited number of verbs. In all other verbs it is expressed through the form of {{lang|de|Konjunktiv I}} of the verbs "to do" ({{lang|pdc|du}}) and "to have" ({{lang|pdc|hawwe}} / {{lang|pdc|have}}) combined with the [[infinitive]] or the [[participle|past participle]], e.g., {{lang|pdc|ich daet esse}} ("I would eat"), {{lang|pdc|ich hett gesse}} ("I would have eaten"). 

Several Pennsylvania German grammars have been published over the years. Two examples are ''A Simple Grammar of Pennsylvania Dutch'' by [[J. William Frey]] and ''A Pennsylvania German Reader and Grammar'' by [[Earl C. Haag]].

===Pronunciation===
{{IPA notice|section}}
The list below ''appears'' to use IPA symbols to represent sounds used in Standard German (to the left), with an arrow pointing to a sound found to be{{clarify|date=November 2013}} at times its Pennsylvania German equivalent. Following each of these entries is an example of a related word from Standard German, once again with an arrow pointing to its modern Pennsylvania German counterpart.

====Vowels====
* {{IPA|/œ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ɛ/}} Example: {{lang|de|Köpfe}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|Kepp}}
* {{IPA|/øː/}} &gt; {{IPA|/eː/}} Example: {{lang|de|schön}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|schee}}
* {{IPA|/ʏ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ɪ/}} Example: {{lang|de|dünn}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|dinn}}
* {{IPA|/yː/}} &gt; {{IPA|/iː/}} Example: {{lang|de|Kühe}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|Kieh}}
* {{IPA|/aː/}} &gt; {{IPA|/oː/}} (in some words) Example: {{lang|de|schlafen}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|schloofe}}
* {{IPA|/aʊ/}} from [[Middle High German]] {{IPA|/oʊ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ɔː/}} Example:  {{lang|de|auch}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|aa}}
* {{IPA|/aʊ/}} from Middle High German {{IPA|/uː/}} &gt; {{IPA|/aʊ/}} Example:  {{lang|de|Bauer}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|Bauer}} 
* {{IPA|/ɔɪ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/aɪ/}} Example:  {{lang|de|neu}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|nei}}
* {{IPA|/o/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ʌ/}}  Example: {{lang|de|Bodde}} (floor) is thus pronounced somewhat like the American ''butter'', but without the final {{angle bracket|r}}. In contrast, the first vowel of {{lang|pdc|Budder}} (''butter'') rhymes with the American ''took''
* final {{IPA|/iː/}} that corresponds with German {{IPA|/ə/}} in that position refects the Middle High German {{IPA|/yː/}} &gt; {{IPA|/iː/}} (only with feminine and plural endings):  {{lang|de|eine gute Frau}} ({{lang-gmh|eine gutiu Frouwe}}) &gt; {{lang|pdc|e guudi Fraa}} (This is a grammatical feature, not a phonetical one)

====Consonants====
* {{IPA|/b/}} &gt; {{IPA|/v/}} or {{IPA|/wː/}}, depending whether the preceding vowel is short or long (only when between vowels, not in initial or final position) (English: {{IPA|/b/}} &gt; {{IPA|/v/}}).  Example: {{lang|de|Kübel}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|Kiwwel}}
* {{IPA|/ɡ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/j/}} (mostly in some words following {{IPA|/r/}} plus a vowel).  Example: {{lang|de|morgen}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|morje}}. For speakers with an Americanized {{angle bracket|r}} ({{IPA|/ɹ/}}) sound, the {{IPA|/j/}} can disappear.
* {{IPA|/ɡ/}} often becomes silent between vowels. Example: {{lang|de|sagen}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|saage}}.  Since the letter {{angle bracket|g}} has been retained by so many past writers, this sound was presumably pronounced as a {{IPA|/ɣ/}} before it disappeared.
* {{IPA|/k/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ɡ/}} (when followed by consonants such as {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/ɹ/}}). Example: {{lang|de|klein}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|glee}}
* final {{IPA|/n/}} generally disappears, including in infinitives. Example: {{lang|de|waschen}} {{IPA|[ˈva.ʃən]}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|Vase}} {{IPA|[ˈva.ʃə]}}
* {{IPA|/p/}} &gt; {{IPA|/b/}} in many words.  Example: {{lang|de|putzen}} {{IPA|[ˈpʰuːt.tsən]}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|budse}} {{IPA|[ˈbuːd.sə]}}
* {{IPA|/pf/}} &gt; {{IPA|/p/}}. Example: {{lang|de|Pfarrer}} {{IPA|[ˈpfaː.rər]}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|Parrer}} {{IPA|[ˈpaː.rər]}}
* final {{IPA|/r/}} after a vowel is even more strongly vocalized than in modern High German, so that {{lang|de|Budder}} is pronounced *''Buddah''. It often disappears entirely from both spelling and pronunciation, as in {{lang|de|Herz}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|Haaz}}.
* {{IPA|/r/}} in all other positions was originally rolled ({{IPA|/r/}}), except for with some Amish, who tended to gutturalize it as in modern High German.  Today most speakers have migrated to have an American {{IPA|/ɹ/}}, at least in part.
* {{IPA|/s/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ʃ/}} before {{IPA|/p/}} or {{IPA|/t/}}, even at the end of a word.  Example: {{lang|de|bist}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|bischt}}
* {{IPA|/s/}} in all other locations is never voiced (always like the first {{angle bracket|s}} in the English ''Susie'', never like the second)
* {{IPA|/t/}} &gt; {{IPA|/d/}}, especially initially and when followed by {{IPA|/r/}} or a vowel.  Example: {{lang|de|tot}} {{IPA|[ˈtʰoːd]}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|dod}} {{IPA|[ˈdoːd]}}; {{lang|de|Butter}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|Budder}}
* w is for many speakers a rounded sound midway between a German and English {{angle bracket|w}}.  This does not apply to German {{IPA|/b/}} sounds that become {{angle bracket|w}} and {{angle bracket|ww}}, which tend to be a true German {{angle bracket|w}}.  Other speakers use a German {{angle bracket|w}} more consistently.
* final {{IPA|/ts/}} &gt; {{IPA|/s/}} with some speakers. Example: {{lang|de|Holz}} {{IPA|[ˈhoːlts]}} &gt; {{IPA|[ˈhoːls]}}

In [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]], there have been numerous other shifts that can make their Pennsylvania German particularly difficult for modern High German speakers to understand. A word beginning in {{angle bracket|gs}} generally becomes {{angle bracket|ts}} (which is more easily pronounced), so that German {{lang|de|gesund}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|gsund}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|tsund}} and German {{lang|de|gesagt}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|gsaat}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|tsaat}}.  Likewise, German {{lang|de|gescheid}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|gscheid}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|tscheid}} (as if it were English *''chite'').  German {{lang|de|zurück}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|zrick}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|tsrick}} (exactly as in American English ''trick'' but with an extra {{angle bracket|s}}).  This shift is rather common with German children learning to speak.

The softened {{angle bracket|w}} after guttural consonants has mixed with the guttural {{angle bracket|r}} of earlier generations and also turned into an American {{angle bracket|r}}, so that German {{lang|de|gewesen}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|gwest}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|grest}} and German {{lang|de|geschwind}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|gschwind}} &gt; {{lang|pdc|tschrind}} (spoken as *''trint'' would be in American English).  These changes in pronunciation, combined with the general disappearance of declensions as described above, result in a form of the dialect that has evolved somewhat from its early Pennsylvania origins nearly 300 years ago, while still being rather easy to understand by German dialect speakers of the Rhineland-Palatinate area.

==Adoption of English vocabulary==
The people from southern Germany, eastern France and Switzerland, from whom the Pennsylvania German culture and dialect sprang, started to arrive in America in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, before the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} To a more limited extent, this is also true of a second wave of immigration in the mid-19th century, which came from the same regions, but settled more frequently in Ohio, Indiana and other parts of the Midwest.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Thus, an entire industrial vocabulary relating to electricity, machinery and modern farming implements has naturally been borrowed from the English. For Pennsylvania German speakers who work in a modern trade or in an industrial environment, this could potentially increase the challenge of maintaining their mother tongue.

Numerous English words have been borrowed and adapted for use in Pennsylvania German since the first generations of Pennsylvania German habitation of southeastern Pennsylvania. Examples of English loan words that are relatively common are "bet" ({{lang|pdc|Ich bet, du kannscht Deitsch schwetze}} = I bet you can speak Pennsylvania German), "depend" ({{lang|de|Es dependt en wennig, waer du bischt}} = it depends somewhat on who you are); {{lang|pdc|tschaepp}} for "chap" or "guy"; and {{lang|pdc|tschumbe}} for "to jump". Today, many speakers will use Pennsylvania German words for the smaller numerals and English for larger and more complicated numbers, like $27,599.

== Pennsylvania Dutch English ==
Conversely, although many among the earlier generations of Pennsylvania Germans could speak English, they were known for speaking it with a strong and distinctive accent. Such [[Pennsylvania Dutch English]] can still sometimes be heard to this day. Although this more recently coined term is being used in the context of this and related articles to describe this Pennsylvania German-influenced English, it has traditionally been referred to as "Dutchy" or "Dutchified" English.

== Survival ==
Pennsylvania German, which is now in its fourth century on [[North America]]n soil, had more than 250,000 speakers in 2012. It has shifted its center to the West with approximately 160,000 speakers in [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Iowa]] and other Midwest states.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; There is even a small but growing number of Pennsylvania German speakers in [[Upper Barton Creek]] and [[Springfield, Belize|Springfield]] in [[Belize]] among Old Order Mennonites of the [[Noah Hoover Mennonite|Noah Hoover group]]. The dialect is used vigorously by the [[horse and buggy]] Old Order Mennonites in the northern part of the [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo]] in Ontario, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Maple_View_North_Mennonite_Meetinghouse_(Alma,_Ontario,_Canada)|title=Maple View North Mennonite Meetinghouse (Alma, Ontario, Canada) - GAMEO|author=|date=|website=gameo.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While speakers without an [[Anabaptist]] background in general do not pass the dialect to their children today, the [[Amish|Old Order Amish]] and horse-and-buggy [[Old Order Mennonites]] do so in the current generation and there are no signs that this practice will end in the future. There are only two car driving Anabaptist groups who have preserved the dialect: The [[Old Beachy Amish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Midwest_Beachy_Amish_Mennonite_Church|title=Midwest Beachy Amish Mennonite Church - GAMEO|author=|date=|website=gameo.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Kauffman Amish Mennonite]]s, also called Sleeping Preacher Churches.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Kraybill|Donald B. Kraybill]]: ''Concise Encyclopedia of Amish, Brethren, Hutterites and Mennonites'', Baltimore, 2010, page 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Amish and Old Order Mennonites were originally a minority group within the Pennsylvania German-speaking population, today they form the vast majority. According to sociologist [[John A. Hostetler]], less than 10 percent of the original Pennsylvania German population was Amish or Mennonite.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

[[File:Pennsylvania German Sticker.svg|thumb|right|Pennsylvania German Sticker "We still speak the mother tongue"]]
There have been efforts to advance the use of the dialect. [[Kutztown University]] offers a complete minor program in Pennsylvania German Studies. The program includes two full semesters of the Pennsylvania German dialect. In the 2007–2008 school year, the classes were being taught by Professor Edward Quinter. In 2008–2009, Professor Robert Lusch served as the instructor.

Since 2005, Pennsylvania Germans have been working on a [[:pdc:|Pennsylvania German version of Wikipedia]].

According to one scholar, "today, almost all Amish are functionally bilingual in Pennsylvania Dutch and English; however, domains of usage are sharply separated. Pennsylvania Dutch dominates in most in-group settings, such as the dinner table and preaching in church services. In contrast, English is used for most reading and writing. English is also the medium of instruction in schools and is used in business transactions and often, out of politeness, in situations involving interactions with non-Amish. Finally, the Amish read prayers and sing in Standard, or High, German ({{lang|pdc|Hoch Deitsch}}) at church services. The distinctive use of three different languages serves as a powerful conveyor of Amish identity."&lt;ref&gt;''An Amish Paradox: Diversity and Change in the World's Largest Amish Community'' by Charles E. Hurst and David L. McConnell. The Johns Hopkins University Press: 2010. {{ISBN|0-8018-9398-4}} pg 15-16&lt;/ref&gt; Although "the English language is being used in more and more situations," nonetheless Pennsylvania Dutch is "one of a handful of minority languages in the United States that is neither endangered nor supported by continual arrivals of immigrants."&lt;ref&gt;''An Amish Paradox: Diversity and Change in the World's Largest Amish Community'' by Charles E. Hurst and David L. McConnell. The Johns Hopkins University Press: 2010. {{ISBN|0-8018-9398-4}} pg 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it is an isolated dialect and almost all native speakers are bilingual in English, the biggest threat to the dialect is gradual decay of the traditional vocabulary, which is then replaced by English loan words or words corrupted from English.

In the United States, most Old Order Amish and all "horse and buggy" Old Order Mennonite groups speak Pennsylvania German, except the [[Virginia Old Order Mennonite Conference|Old Order Mennonites of Virginia]], where German was already mostly replaced at the end of the 19th century. There are several Old Order Amish communities (especially in Indiana) where [[Bernese German]], a form of Swiss German and [[Low Alemannic]] [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]], not Pennsylvania German, are spoken. Additionally, English has mostly replaced Pennsylvania German among the car driving Old Order [[Weaverland Old Order Mennonite Conference|Horning]] and the [[Ohio-Indiana Mennonite Conference|Wisler]] Mennonites. 

Other religious groups among whose members the Pennsylvania German dialect would have once been predominant, include: [[Lutheran]] and German Reformed congregations of Pennsylvania German background, [[Schwenkfelder Church|Schwenkfelders]], and [[Schwarzenau Brethren|Schwarzenau (German Baptist) Brethren]].&lt;ref name=reed-bbf&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reed|first1=Frank L.|title=Pennsylvania "Dutch"|url=https://biblicalbrethrenfellowship.wordpress.com/2013/03/03/pennsylvania-dutch/|website=Biblical Brethren Fellowship|accessdate=17 December 2015|date=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until fairly recent times, the speaking of Pennsylvania German had absolutely no religious connotations.

In Ontario, Canada, the Old Order Amish, the members of the [[Ontario (Old Order) Mennonite Conference|Ontario Old Order Mennonite Conference]], the [[David Martin Mennonites|David Martin Old Order Mennonites]], the [[Orthodox Mennonites]] and smaller pockets of others (regardless of religious affiliation) speak Pennsylvania German. The members of the car driving Old Order [[Markham-Waterloo Mennonite Conference]] have mostly switched to English. In 2017, there were about 10.000 speakers of Pennsylvania German in Canada, far fewer than in the United States.

There are also attempts being made in a few communities to teach the dialect in a classroom setting; however, as every year passes by, fewer and fewer in these particular communities speak the dialect. There is still a weekly radio program in the dialect whose audience is made up mostly of these diverse groups, and many Lutheran and Reformed congregations in Pennsylvania that formerly used German have a yearly service in Pennsylvania German. Other non-native speakers of the dialect include those persons that regularly do business with native speakers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Among them, the Old Order Amish population was probably around 227,000 in 2008.&lt;ref name="Scolforo"&gt;{{cite news |title=Amish population nearly doubles in 16 years|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-08-20-3770622862_x.htm|author=Mark Scolforo|date=2008-08-20|accessdate=3 February 2011|newspaper=USA Today|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Old Order Mennonite population, a sizable percentage of which is Pennsylvania German-speaking, numbers several tens of thousands. There are also thousands of other Mennonites who speak the dialect, as well as thousands more older Pennsylvania German speakers of non-Amish and non-Mennonite background. The Grundsau Lodge, which is an organization in southeastern Pennsylvania of Pennsylvania German speakers, is said to have 6,000 members. Therefore, a fair estimate of the speaker population in 2008 might be close to 300,000, although many, including some academic publications, may report much lower numbers, uninformed of those diverse speaker groups.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

There are no formal statistics on the size of the Amish population, and most who speak Pennsylvania German on the Canadian and [[US Census|U.S.]] censuses would report that they speak German, since it is the closest option available. Pennsylvania German was reported under ethnicity in the 2000 census.&lt;ref&gt;US Census Bureau, [https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf Ancestry: 2000, Census 2000 Brief C2KBR-35] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040920132346/http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf |date=2004-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution ==

Pennsylvania German speakers live mostly in the United States and Canada, but there are also some speakers who belong to traditional Anapaptist groups in [[Latin America]]. Even though most Mennonite communities in Belize speak Plautdietsch, some few hundreds who came to Belize mostly around 1970 and who belong to the [[Noah Hoover Mennonite]]s speak Pennsylvania German.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Scott (writer)|Stephen Scott]]: ''Old Order and Conservative Mennonites Groups'', Intercourse, PA 1996, page 104.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some recent [[New Order Amish]] immigrants in [[Bolivia]] and [[Argentina]] who speak Pennsylvania German while the great majority of conservative Mennionites in these countries speak Plautdietsch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amishamerica.com/2016-amish-population/ 2016 Amish Population: Two New Settlements In South America] at amishamerica.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

In [[Mario Pei]]'s book ''Language'', a popular poem in the dialect (with significant English influence in the form of loanwords) is printed; the free-translation is, in the main, by J. Cooper.
{{Verse translation |lang=pdc
|1=Heut is 's xäctly zwanzig Johr
Dass ich bin owwe naus; &lt;!-- Should this be "owwen aus" (''cf.'' standard German "oben aus" or haplologized "oben und aus")? --&gt;

Und steh am Schulhaus an d'r Krick
Juscht nächst ans Daddy's Haus.
|2=Today it's exactly twenty years
Since I went up and away;
Now I am back again, alive,
And stand at the schoolhouse by the creek
Just next to Grandpa's house.

Following the links, there are two examples of spoken Pennsylvania German: {{lang|pdc|Die mudder schprooch}} (The mother tongue)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWi6oK4sUNI "Die mudder schprooch"] at youtube.com&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|pdc|Bisht du en Christ gebore?}} (Are you born as a Christian?).&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalrecordings.net/de/program/c10421 Worte des Lebens - Pennsylvania Dutch: ''Bisht du en Christ gebore?''] at globalrecordings.net&lt;/ref&gt; More example of spoken Pennsylvania German can be found at the page "American Languages - our nation's many languages online" of the University of Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csumc.wisc.edu/AmericanLanguages/search_clip_type.php?clip_type=PennDutch ''Pennsylvania Dutch''] at http://csumc.wisc.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a Pennsylvania German song is "{{lang|pdc|Mei Vadder un Mudder sinn Deitsch}}" (My father and mother are German), here sung by [[John Schmid]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dA2icD6Zbw ''Mei Vadder un Mudder sinn Deitsch''] at youtube.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
''[[The Office (U.S.)|The Office]]'' character [[Dwight Schrute]] and his family, including his cousin [[Mose Schrute|Mose]], are frequently mentioned to be speakers of Pennsylvania German. Although Schrute works in the titular office, he also owns and operates an Amish-style beet farm and often alludes to his family's long Pennsylvania German heritage.

''[[Orange is the New Black]]'' character [[List_of_recurring_Orange_Is_the_New_Black_characters#Leanne_Taylor|Leanne Taylor]] and family are featured speaking Pennsylvania Dutch in flashbacks showing her Amish background before ending up in penitentiary.

The '''Power Good signal''' ('''power-good''') prevents a computer from attempting to operate on improper voltages and damaging itself by alerting it to improper power supply.

==ATX Power Good==
The [[ATX]] specification defines the Power-Good signal as a +5-volt (V) signal generated in the power supply when it has passed its internal self-tests and the outputs have stabilized. This normally takes between 0.1 and 0.5 seconds after the power supply is switched on. The signal is then sent to the [[motherboard]], where it is received by the processor timer chip that controls the reset line to the processor.

The ATX specification requires that the power-good signal ("PWR_OK") go high no sooner than {{nowrap|100 ms}} ''after'' the power rails have stabilized, and remain high for {{nowrap|16 ms}} after loss of AC power, and fall (to less than {{nowrap|0.4 V}}) at least {{nowrap|1 ms}} ''before'' the power rails fall out of specification (to 95% of their nominal value).

Cheaper and/or lower quality power supplies do not follow the ATX specification of a separate monitoring circuit; they instead wire the power good output to one of the {{nowrap|5 V}} lines. This means the processor will never reset given bad power unless the {{nowrap|5 V}} line drops low enough to turn off the trigger, which could be too low for proper operation.

==Power Good values==
Power good value is based on the delay in [[Millisecond|ms]], that a power supply takes to become fully ready. Power good values are often considered abnormal if detected lower than 100ms or higher than 500ms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coolmaxusa.com/productDetailsPower.asp?item=PS-228&amp;details=features&amp;subcategory=powertester&amp;category=powertester Manufacturer of a power supply tester]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="733">A '''producing house''' is a [[theatre]] which produces its own shows in-house. Theaters which do not produce their own material are known as [[receiving house]]s.

The term is generally used only in connection to plays, [[opera]], or dance. Some theaters may produce some of their own shows, but also rent its facilities to shows produced elsewhere. These venues are both "producing" and "receiving" houses.

Most [[West End theatre]]s in [[London]] and on [[Broadway theatre]]s are not producing houses as the venue solely provides facilities to the incoming show even though the production may stay for many years.

[[File:Justice statue.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lady Justice]]—allegory of justice—statue at court building in [[Olomouc]]]]
'''Remand''' (also known as '''pre-trial detention''' or '''provisional detention''') is the process of [[Detention (imprisonment)|detaining]] a [[person]] who has been [[arrest]]ed and [[criminal charge|charged]] with an offense until their [[trial]]. A person who is held on remand may be held as a [[prisoner]] in [[prison]]. Varying terminology is used, but "remand" is generally used in [[common law]] jurisdictions. Detention before charge is referred to as [[Police custody|custody]] and continued detention after conviction is referred to as [[Detention (imprisonment)|imprisonment]].

Because imprisonment without trial is contrary to the [[presumption of innocence]], in [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] pre-trial detention is usually subject to safeguards and restrictions. Typically, a suspect will only be remanded if it is likely that they could commit a serious crime, interfere with the investigation, or fail to turn up in court. In the majority of court cases, the suspect will be outside of custody while awaiting trial, often with restrictions such as [[bail]].

Research on pretrial detention in the United States has found that pretrial detention increases the likelihood of convictions, primarily because individuals, who would otherwise be acquitted or have their charges dropped, enter guilty pleas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=Megan T.|title=Distortion of Justice: How the Inability to Pay Bail Affects Case Outcomes|url=https://academic.oup.com/jleo/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jleo/ewy019/5100740|journal=The Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization|language=en|doi=10.1093/jleo/ewy019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Detention before charge==
The pre-charge detention period is the period of time during which an individual can be held and questioned by police, prior to being [[indictment|charged]] with an offence.&lt;ref name="liberty"&gt;{{Citation

The prohibition of prolonged detention without charge, ''[[Habeas corpus#Origins in England|habeas corpus]]'', was first introduced in England about a century after [[Magna Carta]]; the use of ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' in 1305 was cited by [[William Blackstone]].

Under Article 8 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms]] of the [[Czech Republic]], which has the same legal standing as the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|Czech Constitution]], a suspect must be immediately familiarized with the grounds of detention, must be interviewed and within 48 hours either released or charged and handed over to a court.

Detailed rules of detention are included in the Criminal Procedural Code. The [[Police of the Czech Republic|police]] may arrest and detain a suspect after obtaining prosecutor's consent. In an urgent case the police may detain a suspect without the consent. In both cases, however, the police detention may take place only when grounds for pre-trial detention exist ([[Remand in the Czech Republic|see below]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Anybody may detain a person, who was caught while perpetrating a crime (not a misdemeanor) or immediately after it, when capturing of the perpetrator is necessary to either ascertain the perpetrator's identity or to prevent the perpetrator from escaping or to secure evidence. The perpetrator must immediately be handed over to the police, or when that is not possible, detention of the perpetrator must be immediately reported to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], a person is protected by the [[United States Constitution|federal constitution]] from being held in prison unlawfully.  The right to have one's detention reviewed by a judge is called ''[[habeas corpus]]''. The U.S. Constitution states that "The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it". A declaration of a [[state of emergency]] can suspend the right to ''habeas corpus''.

{{quote box|align=right|width=40em|No person shall be held to answer for any capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; ... nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law|salign=right|source={{emdash}}[[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]}}

The [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] requires [[criminal defendant]]s to be "informed of the nature and cause of the accusation". The [[United States Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]] thus grants some protection against being held without criminal charge, subject to the courts' interpretation of what [[due process]] means.  Federal authorities have also exercised the power to arrest people on the basis of being a [[material witness]].  [[Involuntary commitment]] of the mentally ill is another category of detention without criminal prosecution, but the right of ''habeas corpus'' still applies.  The scope of such detentions is also limited by the Bill of Rights.

The executive's military powers have been used to justify holding [[enemy combatant]]s as [[prisoners of war]], [[unlawful combatants]], and [[Civilian Internee|civilian internee]]s; the latter two practices have been controversial, especially with regard to the [[indefinite detention without trial|indefinite detention]] implied by uncertainty as to when the "[[War on Terror]]" might be declared to have ended. [[Administrative detention]], a term applied to many of these categories, is also used to imprison [[illegal immigrants]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Pre-trial supervision ==

===Häktning (Swedish law) ===

''[[:sv:Häktning|Häktning]]'' is a pre-trial supervision measure pursuant to [[Judicial system of Sweden|Swedish law]], meaning that a suspect can be detained by a court in the case of crimes for which there is a prison term of one year or more. There are two degrees of suspicion:
*reasonable suspicion (the lower level of suspicion), or
*[[Probable cause#Other countries|probable cause]] (the higher level of suspicion).&lt;ref&gt;[https://lagen.nu/1942:740#K24P1 Rättegångsbalken, 24 ch. 1-3 §] Anyone suspected on probable cause for a crime with a punishment of one year or more can be detained... Also, anyone suspected on reasonable suspicion can be detained, within the limits set in 19 §...&lt;/ref&gt;

Reason for detention is if the crime is a statutory minimum penalty of at least 1 year, and one of:
#risk of [[recidivism]];
#risk that the suspect will destroy evidence or otherwise [[obstruction of justice|affect the investigation of the crime]];
#risk that the suspect will flee prosecution or punishment,
or, for "probable cause" suspicion and also for lesser crimes:
#the suspect is without permanent residence in Sweden, and can be assumed wanting to leave Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;https://lagen.nu/1942:740#K24P2 Rättegångsbalken, 24 ch. 2-3 §"1. if he is unidentified and refuses to reveal his name and residence or if his statements on this matter can be assumed to be false, or &lt;br&gt;2. if he is without residence in the country and there is a risk that he, by leaving the country, evades trial or punishment."&lt;/ref&gt;
#the identity of the suspect is not established, if he refuses to say it or has given a false identity.

A person may be held in custody for a period of normally not more than 14 days (seven days if only the degree of suspicion "reasonable suspicion" exists), then normally new remand hearing should be held. For suspect who has not yet turned 18 needed "serious reasons" for detention decisions are to be notified of the court.

A person, with less serious crimes, they are given by prosecutors a summary penalty order.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.domstol.se/funktioner/english/legal-proceedings/trials-in-criminal-cases&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who was ''häktad'' but was not charged (or was freed after trial) is entitled to financial compensation, with an amount determined by the [[Chancellor of Justice#Sweden|Chancellor of Justice]]. It is usually around 500 SEK (US$80) per day for the suffering, somewhat more if there was media attention, plus compensation for lost work income. 1200 people were compensated in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&amp;artikel=1933995 “More and more people get compensation after arrest”, Radio Sweden, 05 March, 2008] "close to 1,200 people were compensated last year for being ''häktade'' without being convicted of a crime."&lt;/ref&gt; If the prisoner is sentenced, the time as ''häktad'' counts as a part of the prison time, so that less time will remain after the trial.

The [[Committee for the Prevention of Torture]] of the [[Council of Europe]] has repeatedly criticized pre-trial detention in Sweden for the high percentage of cases where restrictions on communication are applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/documents/swe/2009-34-inf-eng.htm#_Toc248053668 |chapter=Imposition of restrictions on remand prisoners |title=Report to the Swedish Government on the visit to Sweden carried out by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) from 9 to 18 June 2009 |date=11.12.2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such communication restrictions means in Sweden no visits, no telephone calls, no newspapers and no TV.

==Detention after charge==
{{see also|Bail}}
The term "remand" may be used to describe the process of keeping a person in detention rather than granting bail. A prisoner who is denied, refused or unable to meet the conditions of bail, or who is unable to post bail, may be held in a prison on remand. Although remanded prisoners are usually detained separately from sentenced prisoners, due to prison overcrowding they are sometimes held in a shared accommodation with sentenced prisoners. Reasons for being held in custody on remand vary depending on the local legal system, but may include:

*the suspect has been accused of carrying out a particularly serious offence
*the suspect having previous [[conviction (law)|convictions]] for similar offences
*reasons to believe the suspect could leave the court's jurisdiction to avoid its trial and possible punishment
*reasons to believe the suspect may destroy evidence or interfere with [[witness]]es
*the suspect is likely to commit further offences before the trial
*the suspect is believed to be in danger from accomplices, victims, or [[vigilantes]]

In most countries, remand prisoners are considered [[innocent until proven guilty]] by a [[court]] and may be granted greater privileges than sentenced prisoners. For example, most jurisdictions that prohibit convicted criminals from voting in [[election]]s will still allow remand prisoners to vote, unless they have been disqualified from voting for some other reason. Other privileges commonly granted include:

*wearing own clothes rather than prison uniform
*being entitled to additional visiting hours per week

Not all remand prisons grant these privileges, in particular, remand prisoners are often{{Citation needed|reason=Where are the statistics showing this often happens?|date=August 2018}} forced to wear prison uniforms and denied additional visitation rights, supposedly for safety reasons, although some facilities allow remand prisoners to wear a uniform that is a different color or otherwise clearly distinguishable from the uniforms of convicted criminals. Often{{Citation needed|reason=Where are the statistics showing this often happens?|date=August 2018}} they are denied all visits and all newspaper and media access, for risk of interfering with the investigation, such as communicating a story with fellow remand prisoners.

Detailed rules of remand custody are contained in the Criminal Procedural Code. A person may be remanded in custody by the decision of a court only when a number of preconditions is met cumulatively:

Special rules of remand pertain to persons who are processed for extradition, e.g. illegal foreigners, those detained due to international (foreign) [[Arrest warrant|warrant]] or the [[European Arrest Warrant]].

====Conditions in Czech remand prisons====
In the Czech Republic, remand takes place in remand prisons or in separated sections of standard prisons. Remand prisons are often in city centres and appertain to court houses. Most remand prisons are over 80 years old, with some, like [[Pankrác Prison]], being more than 125 years old. Men, women and juveniles are held separately. Also persons charged with committing different types of crimes (e.g. unintentional, intentional, violent, etc.) are held separately.&lt;ref name="omb"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ochrance.cz/ochrana-osob-omezenych-na-svobode/dokumenty/souhrnne-zpravy-z-navstev/|title=Zpráva z návštěvy vazebních věznic [Ombudsperson's Remand Prisons Inspection Report] |publisher=Czech Omudsperson|date=April 2010|accessdate=21 July 2012| language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div style="border: 1px solid #999999; background: #fffffa; text-align: left; padding: 1em 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;'''Deficiencies of remand prisons according to 2010 [[Ombudsman#Czech Republic|Czech ombudsman]]'s report&lt;ref name="omb" /&gt;'''
* insufficient daylight
* too intensive nightlight
* insufficient space for out-walks
* lack of leisure activities
* lack of working opportunities
* presence of prison guards during health care delivery
* restricted access to telephone
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Cells have capacity varying between 1—8 beds, with most having between 2—4 beds. Some remand prisons have rooms intended for watching TV, gyms or chapels, but these are exceptional mainly due to overcrowding and lack of space. All have special areas for interviews between the inmates and their attorneys, visiting rooms and courtyards for out-walks.&lt;ref name="omb" /&gt;

Each cell has a WC divided from the rest of the cell-space and running cold water. Each cell-mate has own bed, storage locker and chair.&lt;ref name="omb" /&gt;

Inmates which are held due to concern of influencing witnesses are held in isolation with very limited possibility of contact with other inmates as well as the outer world (apart from interviews with own attorneys).&lt;ref name="omb" /&gt;

At any given time in 2011, there were around 2.500 inmates in the Czech remand prisons (including ~170 women and ~45 juveniles), compared to some 20.500 convicted inmates (for 10,6 million population).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.vscr.cz/client_data/1/user_files/19/file/spr%C3%A1vn%C3%AD/statistiky/Statistick%C3%A9%20ro%C4%8Denky/Rocenka_2011.pdf|title=Statistická ročenka Vězeňské služby za rok 2011 [2011 annual statistical report of the Prison service]|publisher=Czech Prison Service|year=2012|accessdate=21 July 2012|language=Czech|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231080612/http://vscr.cz/client_data/1/user_files/19/file/spr%C3%A1vn%C3%AD/statistiky/Statistick%C3%A9%20ro%C4%8Denky/Rocenka_2011.pdf|archivedate=31 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average length of remand custody is around 100 days, with few inmates spending in remand more than 2 years.&lt;ref name="omb" /&gt;

More than half of foreign inmates of the Czech remand prisons are from [[Slovakia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Vietnam]]. Other numerous foreigners are from [[Bulgaria]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Moldova]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]] and [[Serbia]]. When it comes to non-European states, there are numerous detainees from [[Nigeria]], [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Mongolia]]. There are mostly only few individuals of other nationalities.&lt;ref name="omb" /&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In [[England and Wales]], a suspect may be remanded after charge if:&lt;ref name="govuk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/charged-crime/remand|title=Being charged with a crime|publisher=[[Gov.uk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The suspect has been charged with a serious crime
*The suspect has been convicted of a serious crime in the past
*The suspect has breached bail conditions or failed to surrender either now or in the past
*The police believe the suspect may not appear in court
*The police believe the suspect may commit another crime if released on bail
Remanding a suspect requires permission from a [[Magistrates' court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]]. After charge, the court can choose to remand the suspect until the first hearing of their trial (if the offence is tried at the [[Crown Court]], there is a [[preliminary hearing]] at a magistrates' court). At the first hearing, the court can then decide whether it necessary to remand the suspect until the end of the trial. Adults will be held on remand at a regular prison, while those below the age of 18 will be held at a secure centre for young people.&lt;ref name="govuk"/&gt; If a remanded suspect is convicted and given a prison sentence, the time they spent on remand is deducted from the length of the sentence. In some cases, a convicted suspect has been released immediately after being sentenced, if the time they spent on remand was longer than or equal to the sentence they received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/16/ukcrime|publisher=The Guardian|title=Craig Meehan sentenced to 20 weeks' jail for possessing child porn|date=16 September 2008|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
The [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] prohibits [[excessive bail]]. Under the [http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sup_01_18_10_II_20_207.html US Code], pretrial detention of federal suspects is allowed only under certain circumstances, such as when the defendant is a danger to witnesses or jurors.&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S.C. § 3142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Two 2018 study in the ''[[The American Economic Review|American Economic Review]]'' and [[The Journal of Law, Economics, &amp; Organization|''the Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization'']] found that pretrial detention significantly increases the probability of conviction, largely because individuals who would otherwise be acquitted in trial enter guilty pleas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dobbie|first=Will|last2=Goldin|first2=Jacob|last3=Yang|first3=Crystal S.|date=2018|title=The Effects of Pre-Trial Detention on Conviction, Future Crime, and Employment: Evidence from Randomly Assigned Judges|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20161503|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=108|issue=2|pages=201–240|doi=10.1257/aer.20161503|issn=0002-8282|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The AER study found that pretrial detention also lowers the defendants' prospects in the labor market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The JLEO study found that pretrial detention caused 42% longer incarceration sentence and 41% higher nonbail court fees owed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The JLEO study notes that "the use of money bail contributes to a “poverty-trap”: those who are unable to pay bail wind up accruing more court debt."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
Pre-trial detention has been described as a "necessary evil".&lt;ref name="JoICJ"/&gt; A 2013 report by the [[Centre for Crime and Justice Studies]] concluded that pre-trial detention was being overused worldwide, and that most were being held for minor crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/publications/cjm/article/overuse-pre-trial-detention-causes-and-consequences|publisher=Centre for Crime and Justice Studies|author=Martin Schönteich|date=29 June 2013|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 report by the [[Open Society Foundations]] called it a "massive and widely ignored pattern of human rights abuse".
&lt;ref name="osf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Presumption of Guilt: The Global Overuse of Pretrial Detention|url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/publications/presumption-guilt-global-overuse-pretrial-detention|publisher=[[Open Society Foundations]]|date=September 2014|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person must be found guilty "beyond [[reasonable doubt]]" in order to be convicted at a trial. However, pre-trial detention requires a lower threshold such as "[[reasonable suspicion]]".&lt;ref name="JoICJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/jicj/article/8/2/407/848174|title=Compensating Acquitted Defendants for Detention before International Criminal Courts|publisher=Journal of International Criminal Justice|date=14 April 2010|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most countries, the prosecution only need to prove that the charges are well-founded and that there is a sufficient threat that the defendant will commit another crime or undermine the judicial process. In the [[United States]], the system of [[Bail|money bail]] means that a defendant can be detained even if neither of these threats can be identified, solely because nobody was willing or able to deposit the bail money for them.

In the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', Stephanie Bibas also noted its impact on [[plea bargain]]ing. Pretrial detention alters a defendant's incentives by making his or her best-case scenario not zero days in jail, but the length of time served pretrial. Therefore, a defendant may be more likely to plead guilty if the chance of acquittal is low, or if the expected sentence on a guilty plea is less than the amount of jail time that would be served pretrial. Pretrial detainees may also find it harder to mount an effective defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Plea Bargaining outside the Shadow of Trial|author=Stephanos Bibas|publisher=Harvard Law Review|volume=117|date=Jun 2004|pages=2463–2547|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Open Society Foundation report also concluded that some detainees face worse conditions than convicted prisoners; for example the suicide rate is three times higher worldwide.&lt;ref name="osf"/&gt;

{{Jainism}}
'''Shivakotiacharya''' (also '''Shivakoti'''), a writer of the 9th-10th century, is considered the author of didactic [[Kannada language]] [[Jainism|Jain]] text ''[[Vaddaradhane]]'' (''lit'', "Worship of elders", ca.&amp;nbsp;900). A prose narrative written in pre-Old-Kannada (''Purva Halegannada''), ''Vaddaradhane'' is considered the earliest [[Extant literature|extant]] work in the prose genre in the Kannada language.&lt;ref name="siva"&gt;Shastri (1955), p. 356&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="siva1"&gt;Zvelebil (2008), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jain"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p. 4027.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars are, however, still divided about when exactly the text was written, with claims ranging from before the 6th century to the 10th century.&lt;ref name="mugali"/&gt;&lt;ref name="period"/&gt;&lt;ref name="khosa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="naro"/&gt;

==Content==
According to the scholar R.S. Mugali, ''Vaddaradhane'' is one of the finest pieces of [[Jainism|Jain]] literature, which stands out by itself in all of [[Kannada literature]].&lt;ref name="mugali"&gt;Mugali (2006), pp. 177&amp;ndash;178&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to religious content describing the lives of Jain saints (''Jainas''),&lt;ref name="siva"/&gt; it treats on Jain tenets regarding the torments of flesh and spirit, interpretations of fate (''[[karma]]''), [[reincarnation|rebirth]] and the plight of humans on earth. The text gives useful information about contemporary society including  education, trade and commerce, magic and superstitions, the [[caste|caste system]] and untouchability, and position of women in society.&lt;ref name="khosa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="naro"/&gt; The text provides details on contemporary urban and rural society: towns with majestic buildings and multi-storied houses; temples (''devalaya''); a street for the prostitutes (''sulegeri''); palaces; streets with people, horses and elephants; homes of cloth merchants (''dusigar''); homes of diamond merchants (''baccara''); feudatories (''samanta'');  royal officials (''niyogi''); grain markets and traders; and various types of settlements such as villages (''grama'') and towns (''nagara'').&lt;ref name="town"&gt;Adiga (2006), p. 71&amp;ndash;72&lt;/ref&gt; The text dwells on the evils of ''[[Kali Yuga]]'' including [[miscegenation]] and takes a critical look at contemporary [[Brahmin]] practices.&lt;ref name="practice"&gt;Adiga (2006), p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; It mentions fierce warriors, royal retainers (''velevali'') who were under oath to lay down their life for the king and royalty.&lt;ref name="royalty"&gt;Adiga (2006), pp. 233&amp;ndash;234&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date controversies==
The dating of the work and its authorship has been a controversy. According to the scholar R.S. Mugali, experts are not unanimous whether the prose piece was written before ''[[Kavirajamarga]]'' (ca.&amp;nbsp;850) or after.&lt;ref name="mugali"/&gt; According to modern Kannada poet and scholar [[M. Govinda Pai]], the ''Vaddaradhane'' dates much further back. Based on his studies of the text and some pre-2nd century inscriptions from [[Shravanabelagola]], Pai authored two scholarly publications in 1960: ''Kannada Sahityada Halame'' ("Antiquity of Kannada literature") and ''Kannada Sahityada Prachinate'' (also meaning "Antiquity of Kannada literature"), in which he argued ''Vaddaradhane'' more accurately dates to the pre-6th century period. However, the scholar D.L.

There is an opinion that Shivakoti was not the author of the work, and that his [[Prakrit]] work ''Bhagavati Aaradhane'' may have been the inspiration for this Kannada writing. However, it has been pointed out that the author's name appears in the concluding section of every story in the writing, and that the Prakrit writer, also named Shivakoti, lived in the 2nd or 3rd century A.D. and was the disciple of [[Acharya Samantabhadra]]. Another name, Revakotiacharya, also appears in some places in the Kannada text.&lt;ref name="jain"/&gt; Historian Jyotsna Kamat is of the opinion that the didactic work comprising 19 stories dates to the 10th century and was inspired by the Sanskrit writing ''Brihatkatha-Khosa''.&lt;ref name="khosa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/deccan/rashtrakutas/literature_kannada.htm|title=Kannada Literature under the Rashtrakutas|publisher=Kamat's Potpourri|accessdate=2009-01-27|first=Jyotsna |last=Kamat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[religion|religious]] context, '''sin''' is an act of transgression against [[divine law|divine]] or [[natural law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=sin|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sin|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sin can also be viewed as any thought or action that endangers the ideal relationship between an individual and [[God]]; or as any diversion from the perceived ideal order for human [[Life|living]]. In [[Jainism]], sin refers to anything that harms the possibility of the ''[[Jiva (Jainism)|jiva]]'' (being) to attain ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'' (supreme emancipation). In [[Islamic ethics]], [[Muslim]]s see sin as anything that goes against the commands of [[Allah]] ([[God in Islam|God]]). [[Judaism]] regards the violation of any of the [[613 commandments]] as a sin.

== Etymology ==
The word derives from "[[Old English]] ''syn(n)'', for original *''sunjō''. The stem may be related to that of Latin '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''sons'', ''sont-is''' guilty. In Old English there are examples of the original general sense, ‘offence, wrong-doing, misdeed'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oed.com/view/Entry/180030?isAdvanced=false&amp;result=1&amp;rskey=9Bb3P3&amp; |title=sin |work=Oxford English Dictionary |accessdate= 16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English Biblical terms translated as "sin" or "syn" from the Biblical Greek and Jewish terms sometimes originate from words in the latter languages denoting the act or state of missing the mark; the original sense of [[New Testament Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἁμαρτία}} ''hamartia'' "sin", is failure, being in error, missing the mark, especially in spear throwing;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a(marti/a|ἁμαρτία}}, {{LSJ|a(marta/nw|ἁμαρτάνω|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jewish views on sin|Hebrew ''hata'' "sin"]] originates in [[archery]] and literally refers to missing the "gold" at the centre of a target, but hitting the target, i.e. error.&lt;ref&gt;
Pagels, Elaine. ''The Gnostic Gospels''. Vintage Books: New York, 1989. p. 123.
&lt;/ref&gt; "To sin" has been defined from a Greek [[Bible concordance|concordance]] as "to miss the mark".&lt;ref&gt;  [http://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/greek/nas/hamartia.html "Hamartia,"] ''The NAS New Testament Greek Lexicon''.&lt;br/&gt;
[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] eventually (after the [[Pelagianism|Pelagian controversy]]) defined sin as a hardened heart, a loss of love for God, a disposition of the heart to depart from God because of inordinate self-love (see Augustine ''On Grace and Free Will'' in ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', trans. P. Holmes, vol. 5, 30-31 [14-15]).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religions ==

=== Bahá'í ===
{{Anchor| Bahá'í faith }}
{{Main|Bahá'í views on sin}}

In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], humans are considered naturally good (perfect), fundamentally spiritual beings. Human beings were created because of God's immeasurable love. However, the Bahá'í teachings compare the human heart to a mirror, which, if turned away from the light of the sun (i.e. God), is incapable of receiving God's love.

=== Buddhism ===
{{Main|Buddhist views on sin}}

[[Buddhism]] believes in the principle of ''[[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]'', whereby [[Dukkha|suffering]] is the inevitable consequence of greed, anger, and delusion (known as the [[Three poisons (Buddhism)|Three poisons]]).&lt;ref&gt;Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, Soka Gakkai, "Three Poisons": "Greed, anger, and foolishness. The fundamental evils inherent in life that give rise to human suffering."&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no direct Buddhist equivalent of the Abrahamic concept of sin, wrongdoing is recognized in Buddhism. The concept of [[Buddhist ethics]] is [[Consequentialism|consequentialist]] in nature and is not based upon duty towards any deity.
Karma means action, and in Buddhist context, motivation is the most important aspect of an action. Whether karma done with mind, body and/or speech is called 'good' or 'bad', depends on whether it would bring pleasant or unpleasant results to the person who does the action. 
One needs to purify negative karma [[Satipatthana Sutta|Four Satipatthanas]] to free oneself from obstacles to liberation from the vicious circle of rebirth. The purification reduces suffering and in the end one reaches [[Nirvana]], the ultimate purification by realizing selflessness or emptiness. An enlightened being is free of all the suffering and karmas, and will not be automatically born again.

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Forbidden fruit.jpg|thumb|A [[Sistine Chapel]] [[fresco]] depicts the [[Expulsion from the Garden of Eden|expulsion]] of [[Adam and Eve]] for [[Original sin|transgressing God's command]] not to eat [[Forbidden fruit|the fruit]] of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]].]]
{{Main|Hamartiology|Christian views on sin}}
{{See also|Christian views on the Old Covenant|Seven deadly sins}}
In the [[Old Testament]], some sins were [[Religion and capital punishment#Christianity|punishable by death]] in different forms, while most sins are forgiven by burnt offerings. [[Christians]] consider the [[Mosaic covenant|Old Covenant]] to be fulfilled by the [[The gospel|Gospel]].

In the [[New Testament]] the [[Atonement in Christianity|forgiveness of sin]] is effected through [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] and [[Repentance (Christianity)|repentance]] ([[Mark 1]]:15).&lt;ref&gt;Mark 1:15&lt;/ref&gt; Sin is [[Forgiveness#Christianity|forgiven]] when the sinner acknowledges, [[Confession (religion)#Christianity|confesses]], and repents for their sin as a part of believing in [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmaus|first1=Michael|title=Dogma: The Church as Sacrament|date=1975|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|isbn=0-7425-3203-8|page=220,222|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5oTziWXEKgC&amp;pg=PA220|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sinner is expected to confess his sins to [[God in Christianity|God]] as a part of an ongoing relationship, which also includes [[Gratitude#Christian conceptions|giving thanks]] to God. The sinful person has never before been in a favorable relationship with God. When, as a part of the process of salvation, a person is forgiven, they enter into a [[Union with Christ|union with God]] which abides forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Willmington|first1=H.L.|title=Willmington's Guide to the Bible|date=1981|publisher=Tyndale House Publishers, Inc.|isbn=0-8423-8804-4|page=725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NeCN2cVnONYC&amp;pg=PA725}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Epistle to the Romans]] [[Romans 6:23|6:23]], it is mentioned that "the wages of sin is death", which is commonly interpreted as, if one repents for his sins, such person will inherit [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Romans 6:23|url=https://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm|website=Biblehub|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jewish Christianity]], sin is believed to alienate the sinner from God even though He has extreme [[Agape|love for mankind]]. It has damaged and completely severed the relationship of humanity to God. That relationship can only be restored through acceptance of Jesus Christ and his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death on the cross]] as a [[Satisfaction theory of atonement|satisfactory sacrifice]] for the sins of humanity. Humanity was [[Destiny#Religion|destined]] for life with God when [[Adam]] disobeyed God. The Bible in [[John 3:16]] says "For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in him, may not perish, but may have life everlasting."

In [[Eastern Christianity]], sin is viewed in terms of its effects on relationships, both among people and likewise between people and God. Also as in Jewish Christianity, Sin is likewise seen as [[Fall of man|the refusal]] to follow [[Will of God|God's plan]] and the desire to be "like God" (as stated in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 3:5) and thus in direct opposition to God's will (see the account of [[Adam and Eve]] in Genesis).

{{Anchor|Original sin}}
[[Original sin]] is a Western concept that states that sin entered the human world through [[Adam and Eve]]'s sin in the [[Garden of Eden]] and that human beings have since lived with the consequences of this first sin.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11312a.htm|title=Original Sin|work=Catholic Encyclopedia|date=1 February 1911 |accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Serpents in the Bible#Eden|The serpent]] who beguiled [[Eve]] to eat of [[Forbidden fruit|the fruit]] was punished by having it and its kind being made to crawl on the ground and God set an enmity between them and [[Genealogies of Genesis|Eve's descendants]] (Genesis 3:14-15). Eve was punished by the pains of childbirth and the sorrow of bringing about life that would eventually age, sicken and die (Genesis 3:16). The second part of the curse about being [[Fall of man#Subordination|subordinate to Adam]] originates from her creation from one of Adam's ribs to be his helper ([[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis 2:18-25]]); the curse now clarifies that she must now obey her [[Christian views on marriage|husband]] and desire only him. Adam was punished by having to work endlessly to feed himself and his family. The land would bring forth both thistles and thorns to be cleared and herbs and grain [[Religion and agriculture|to be planted, nurtured, and harvested]]. The second part of the curse about his mortality is from his origin as red clay - he is from the land and he and his descendants would return to it when [[Christian burial|buried]] after death. When Adam's son [[Cain and Abel|Cain slew his brother Abel]], he introduced murder into the world (Genesis 4:8-10). For his punishment, God banished him as a fugitive, but first [[Curse and mark of Cain|marked him]] with a sign that would protect him and his descendants from harm (Genesis 4:11-16).

One concept of sin deals with things that exist on Earth, but not in [[Heaven in Christianity|Heaven]]. Food, for example, while a necessary good for the (health of the [[Temporality|temporal]]) body, is not of ([[eternity|eternal]]) transcendental living and therefore its ''excessive'' [[Gluttony|savoring]] is considered a sin.&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"&gt;Hanegraaff, Hank. ''The Bible Answer Book'' pp. 18-21. {{ISBN|0-8499-9544-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unforgivable sin (or [[eternal sin]]) is a sin that can never be forgiven;
Matthew 12:30-32 :
" &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; He that is not with me, is against me: and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth. &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; And Therefore I say to you: Every sin and [[Blasphemy#Christianity|blasphemy]] shall be forgiven men, but the blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven. &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; And whosoever shall speak a word against the [[Son of man]], it shall be forgiven him: but he that shall speak against the [[Holy Ghost]], it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come."

In [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Christianity sins are classified into grave sins called [[mortal sin]]s and less serious sins called [[venial sin]]. Mortal sins cause one to lose salvation unless the sinner repents and venial sins require some sort of penance either on Earth or in [[Purgatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church No. 1472|location=The Vatican|url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/1472.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus was said to have paid for the complete mass of sins past, present, and to come in future. Even inevitable sin is said to have already been cleansed.

The [[Lamb of God]] was and is God himself and is therefore sinless. In the Old Testament, [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] 16:21 states that ‘the laying on of hands’ was the action that the High Priest [[Aaron]] was ordered to do yearly by God to take sins of Israel's nation onto a [[sacrificial lamb|spotless young lamb]].

=== Hinduism ===
&lt;!--Section was previously blanked by an IP: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sin&amp;diff=391608941&amp;oldid=391538998 --&gt;
In [[Hinduism]], the term ''sin'' (''{{IAST|pāpa}}'' in [[Sanskrit]]) is often used to describe actions that create negative [[Karma]] by violating moral and ethical codes, which automatically brings negative consequences. This is somewhat  similar to Abrahamic sin in the sense that pāpa is considered a crime against the laws of God, which is known as (1) [[Dharma]], or moral order, and (2) one's own self, but another term ''aparadha'' is used for grave offences. The term papa cannot be taken however, in literal sense as that of a sin. This is because there is no consensus regarding the nature of ultimate reality or God in Hinduism. Only, the vedanta school being unambiguously theistic, whereas no anthropomorphic God exists in the rest five schools namely Samkhya, Nyaya Yoga, Vaishashikha, and  Purva-Mimansa . The term  ''papa'' however in the strictest sense refers to actions which bring about wrong/unfavourable consequences, not relating to a specific divine will in the absolute sense. To conclude, considering a  lack of consensus  regarding the nature of ultimate reality in Hinduism, it can be considered that ''papa'' has lesser insistence on God for it be translated as Sin, and that there is no exact equivalent to Sin in Hinduism.

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Islamic views on sin}}

In [[Islamic ethics]], [[Muslim]]s see sin as anything that goes against the commands of [[Allah]] ([[God in Islam|God]]), a breach of the laws and norms laid down by religion.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2211|work=Sin|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic terms for sin include ''dhanb'' and ''khaṭīʾa'', which are synonymous and refer to intentional sins; ''khiṭʾ'', which means simply a sin; and ''ithm'', which is used for grave sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Wensinck, A. J. | year= 2012 | title=K̲h̲aṭīʾa |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/2214-871X_ei1_SIM_4141|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
In [[Jainism]], the word for sin is the Sanskrit word पाप (''paap''), which is the antithesis of पुण्य (''punya'') meaning merit. A ''[[Jiva (Jainism)|jiva]]'' (a being) acquires sin based on its [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], if it hurts anyone, causes someone to hurt anyone, or commends hurting anyone by thought, speech or action. Anyone, here, refers to literally any living organism, but not limited to human beings.

No ''jiva'' can achieve ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'' (ultimate emancipation) without ceasing to accumulate karma and shedding off the already accumulated karma entirely. A ''jiva'' accumulates karma if it resorts to violence, non-chastity, falsehood, stealing, and possessiveness. A ''jiva'' ceases to accumulate karma if he resorts to the golden trio of ''samyak gyan'' (right knowledge), ''samyak darshan'' (right sight) and ''samyak charitra'' (right character). A ''jiva'' begins to shed off the accumulated karma by resorting to penance, repentance, vows and by exterminating foes of lust, anger, attachment, aversion, ignorance and fallacy.

If a ''jiva'' does not give up sin, his karma will keep accumulating and no sin can be absolved without getting its fruit or repenting for it. Thus such a ''jiva'' is bound to remain in the worldly cycle of constant [[reincarnation]], wherein it will keep taking rebirths, into any of the four broad types of living organisms, depending on the magnitude and nature of karma accumulated in previous birth(s). The four types are ''dev'' (beings of heaven, including deities), ''manushya'' (human), ''tiryanch'' (plants, animals, insects, etc.) and ''naarki'' (beings of hell). 

During this cycle of getting born and dying for infinity, the ''jiva'' will have to then live the life of the organism he is and while living it, the ''jiva'' will again perform more karma. This will again lead to rebirth and again performing more karma. Thus, the cycle continues.

It is important to note that Jains believe that for complete liberation, not only the "sinful karma" but even the "meritorious karma" needs to be shed off. This means that a jiva can truly attain moksha, only if the soul is completely and absolutely pure and devoid of any accumulation. For instance, sins may cause the ''jiva'' to be reborn, inter alia, in hell and merits may cause it to be reborn in heaven. But heaven, like hell is a part of worldly cycle of reincarnation and not supreme moksha of the soul. Thus, if a person hypothetically keeps performing only and exclusively good deeds in his life, he may still not attain ''moksha'', because he has not yet shed off previously accumulated sins through repentance and knowledge.

Jains believe that only a human ''jiva'' has the capacity and the will to attain ''moksha''. Hence the ''jiva'' should use this extremely rare opportunity of being born as a human to walk on the path that brings him closer to ''moksha''. In fact, Jains take the concept of avoiding sin so seriously that not only are they completely [[vegetarian]] but some devout Jains also abstain from eating underground grown food like potatoes, onions, etc. to avoid killing small organisms. Most of the Jains are also nonalcoholics and eat before sunset each day.

=== Judaism ===
{{Main|Jewish views on sin|Golden mean (philosophy)#Judaism}}
Mainstream [[Judaism]] regards the violation of any of the [[613 commandments]] of the [[Mosaic law]] for [[Jews]], or the seven [[Noahide laws]] for [[Gentiles]] as a sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/The_Seven_Noahide_Laws.html|title= The Seven Noachide Laws - Jewish Virtual Library|publisher= Jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate= 14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism teaches that all humans are inclined to sin from birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Rosenberg|first1= A. J.|last2= [[Rashi]]|title= The Book of Genesis (Genesis 8:21 with [[Rashi]]'s commentary)|date= 1969|publisher= The Judaica Press|location= New York|isbn= 1880582082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sin has many classifications and degrees. Some sins are punishable with death by the court, others with death by heaven, others with lashes, and others without such punishment, but no sins with willful intent go without consequence. Unwillful violations of the [[613 commandments|mitzvot]] (without negligence) do not count as sins. "Sins by error" are considered as less severe sins. When the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] yet stood in Jerusalem, people would offer [[Karbanot|sacrifices]] for their misdeeds. The atoning aspect of ''[[korbanot]]'' is carefully circumscribed. For the most part, ''korbanot'' only expiate such "sins by error", that is, sins committed because a person forgot or did not know that this thing was a sin. In some circumstances, lack of knowledge is considered close to deliberate intent. No atonement is needed for violations committed under duress, and for the most part, ''korbanot'' cannot atone for a deliberate sin. In addition, ''korbanot'' have no expiating effect unless the person making the offering sincerely repents his or her actions before making the offering, and makes restitution to any person who suffered harm through the violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/qorbanot.html|title= Sacrifices and Offerings (Karbanot)|publisher= Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate= 1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rabbimichaelskobac"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/answers/jewish-polemics/texts/scriptural-studies/leviticus-1711/|title= Leviticus 17:11|author= Rabbi Michael Skobac|publisher= Jews for Judaism|accessdate= 1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judaism teaches that all willful sin has consequences. The completely righteous suffer for their sins (by humiliation, poverty, and suffering that God sends them) in this world and receive their reward in the world to come. The in-between (not completely righteous or completely wicked), suffer for and repent their sins after death and thereafter join the righteous. The very evil do not repent even at the gates of hell. Such people prosper in this world to receive their reward for any good deed, but cannot be cleansed by and hence cannot leave ''[[Gehenna|gehinnom]]'', because they do not or cannot repent. This world can therefore seem unjust where the righteous suffer, while the wicked prosper. Many great thinkers have contemplated this.&lt;ref name="rabbimichaelskobac"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Delinquent property tax lien list.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Pima County, Arizona]] delinquent property tax list for auction by the County Treasurer]]
A '''tax sale''' is the forced sale of property (usually [[real estate]]) by a governmental entity for unpaid taxes by the property's owner.

The sale, depending on the jurisdiction, may be a '''tax deed sale''' (whereby the actual property is sold) or a '''tax lien sale''' (whereby a lien on the property is sold)  Under the tax lien sale process, depending on the jurisdiction, after a specified period of time if the lien is not redeemed, the lienholder may seek legal action which will result in the lienholder either automatically obtaining the property, or forcing a future tax deed sale of the property and possibly obtaining the property as a result.

==General==
The governmental entity can be any level of government that can assess and collect property taxes or other governmental debt, such as counties (parishes, in the case of Louisiana), cities, townships (in [[New England]] and other jurisdictions), and school districts (in places where they are independent of other governmental jurisdictions, such as in Texas).

State law offers the governmental entity a method of collecting its tax without simply having to "ding" the nonpaying person or business, by (after a specified grace period, whereby the property owner can be charged interest and/or penalties as well as other costs) placing a [[lien]] on the property which, if not paid, will result in future cost and ultimately the seizure and selling of the property.  In most places in the US, a tax lien takes priority, eclipsing other liens such as mortgages.

The requirements to begin the foreclosure process (and to avoid it) must be strictly followed; otherwise, the property owner will lose all rights to the property (or the governmental entity will lose its right to collect the outstanding debt).  Common requirements include:
*sending a letter by certified or registered mail to any and all owners of record as shown on the entity's records (some jurisdictions require an attempt at personal service), as well as to any person shown as having a mortgage, lien, or "other interest" in the property,
*placing a public notice in a [[newspaper of record|newspaper designated to publish legal notices]],
*posting notice at the local courthouse or other public place designated for official notices, and/or
*posting notice on the property itself in such a place and manner that it is visible to the public (such as the outside of an exterior door, or a sign on the property if it is unimproved).

Once the process begins, the property owner can still avoid foreclosure by paying the amount owed plus interest, penalties, and/or other costs or fees.  The amounts can end up being quite high once the process is well under way.&lt;ref&gt;NPR reported on a woman losing her home in Baltimore in May 2010 because she had missed a water payment of $360; over time her obligation multiplied to over $3,000 after penalties, interest, and other fees were added.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even after foreclosure, in some jurisdictions the owner can still recover the property by paying the amounts owed (plus additional interest/penalties/costs) within a specified time.  Alternatively, the owner can file suit to have the sale set aside on grounds that the requirements were not followed (such as proper notice not given).

==Sales==
Two main methods are used to capture delinquent real property tax: the tax deed sale and the tax lien sale.

Both methods operate using an [[auction]] method.  Traditionally, the auctions have been live events held at the county courthouse or another designated official location.  However, online auctions have increased in usage.&lt;ref&gt;Online auctions allow for more sales in less time, as well as allowing bidders from outside the area (such as out-of-state or foreign bidders) to participate.  [[Counties of Florida|Florida counties]], in particular, have embraced Internet auctions in interest.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax deed sale===
In a tax deed sale, the property itself is sold.

At the sale, the minimum bid is generally the amount of back taxes owed plus interest, as well as costs associated with selling the property.  The purchaser making the '''''highest''''' bid for the property takes title.  However, the purchaser usually has a very short period (generally 48–72 hours) to pay the entire amount owed, or else the sale is invalidated.

Depending on the jurisdiction, any amount in excess of the minimum bid may or may not be returned to the original property owner, or the owner may forfeit rights to such excess amount if not claimed within a specified period.  Also, anyone having an interest in the property (such as a governmental entity having weed liens on the property) may, in some cases, claim the excess.

In the event the property is not purchased at auction, title generally reverts to the governmental entity that initiated the sale, which can then offer it for at or even below the original minimum bid (depending on property value and/or interest in the parcel).

Title is generally transferred in a tax deed sale through a form of limited warranty or [[quitclaim deed]] (sometimes styled as '''Tax Deed''' or '''Sheriff's Deed''').  In most jurisdictions, this type of deed is generally insufficient to acquire title insurance.&lt;ref&gt;A notable exception is Illinois, where a "Tax Deed" delivers a clean title, as the issuing court removes all clouds on the title in its order directing the issuance of the deed.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, a purchaser would most likely then need to initiate a [[quiet title]] action in order to resell the property later.  However, the property can be sold from one purchaser to another using a limited warranty or another quitclaim deed, though usually at far less than its market value.

Some jurisdictions allow for a post-sale "redemption period," whereby the former owner has a specified amount of time to reclaim the property by repaying the amount bid at auction plus interest, penalties, and/or other costs.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Texas allows a two year redemption period for homestead or agricultural properties, and a 180-day period for all other properties.  The amount to be paid is the amount paid at the sale (which could be more than the original bid), plus 25% of that amount paid at the sale (for homestead and agricultural properties redeemed after the first year, the penalty is 50% of the amount paid), plus deed recording costs. See http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/TX/htm/TX.34.htm Texas Tax Code, Section 34.21(a) (for homestead/agricultural properties) and (e) (for all other properties).&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, purchasers of properties at tax deed sales are cautioned not to make major improvements on the property until after the redemption period has expired, as such improvements would then become the property of the original owner.

A tax deed sale may also be used in conjunction with a tax lien sale process, whereby the lienholder (instead of a governmental agency) starts the process toward forcing a public sale of the property.&lt;ref&gt;Florida uses tax lien sales at the initial tax delinquency, and the tax deed sale (upon a lienholder's request) to sell the property in order to redeem the lien.&lt;/ref&gt;  In those instances the lienholder's investment (the price of the lien plus any additional costs necessary to start the tax deed sale process, such as required fees and payment of any still-unpaid taxes or buyout of other certificate holders' interests) constitutes the minimum bid; if no other bids are received at the sale then the lienholder will take title to the property subject to redemption periods (if applicable) or any lawsuit to overturn the sale.

====Pitfalls of tax deed investing====
Although the possibility of obtaining property at rates far below market values is promising, there are several pitfalls which must be taken into account before investing:

*Payment is usually required at purchase or within a very short time afterward (often no more than 24–72 hours), and certified funds are required (i.e. financing is not allowed).  Failure to pay the full amount generally results in the sales of '''all''' properties purchased by the investor being cancelled; the investor may also be barred from future sales in that jurisdiction.
*Though touted as a means of obtaining property at very low cost, in practice when a property is placed for auction at a tax deed sale, it is usually sold at a higher price than the original minimum bid of the back taxes, accrued interest, and costs of sale.
*As stated above, in most jurisdictions properties sold in this manner are conveyed to the highest bidder via "tax deed" (or similarly-named deed), a form of quitclaim deed.  Thus, the holder of the tax deed would then have to file a quiet title action, in order to clear any title defects or obtain a mortgage or title insurance.
*Should a property be obtained, it may still be subject to other liens and assessments on the property which are not extinguished at sale.   These liens and assessments (and their related interest) can, in some instances, exceed the value of the property itself, making it virtually worthless.
*Some states allow a post-closing redemption period, during which time the original owner can redeem the property by paying the amount bid plus interest/penalty and costs.  As such, if the purchaser makes improvements on the property and the original owner redeems it within the redemption period, the purchaser may lose those improvements if they are physically attached to the property and cannot be removed.

===Tax lien sale===
In a tax lien sale, instead of selling the actual property, the governmental entity sells a lien on the property.  The lien is generally for the amount of delinquent taxes, accrued interest, and costs associated with the sale.

In the event that more than one investor seeks the same lien, depending on state law the winner will be determined by one of five methods:
# '''Bid Down the Interest'''.  Under this method, the stated rate of return offered by the government is the '''''maximum''''' rate of return allowed.  However, investors can accept lower rates of return, including zero percent in some cases.  The investor accepting the '''''lowest''''' rate of return is the winner.  In the event that more than one investor will accept the same lower rate, the tie may be broken by 1) first bid received, 2) random selection, or 3) rotational method (see below for further discussion of the latter two methods).  (States that use this method include Arizona and Florida&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0100-0199/0197/Sections/0197.432.html Florida Statutes, Section 197.432(6).&lt;/ref&gt;)
# '''Premium'''.  Under this method, the investor willing to pay the highest '''''premium''''' (excess above the lien amount) will be the winner.  The premium may earn interest at a different rate than the base lien value (or may not earn interest at all), and in some cases may not be paid back to the investor upon redemption of the lien.  (States that include this method include Colorado; Colorado does not pay interest on the premium nor does it return it upon redemption)
# '''Random Selection'''.  Under this method, a bidder will be randomly selected from those offering a bid.  Usually, a computer is used to make the selection, but in smaller jurisdictions more rudimentary methods may be used.  (States that use this method include Nevada&lt;ref&gt;Technically per the statutes, Nevada is supposed to award the lien to the first buyer making an offer; however, in practice it is sometimes hard to determine who was the first person bidding &amp;ndash; especially at live auctions where multiple bidders are shouting interest &amp;ndash; and thus the random method is used.&lt;/ref&gt;)
# '''Rotational Selection'''.  Under this method, the first lien offered for sale will be offered to the investor holding bidder number one, who has the right of first refusal.  If bidder number one refuses the lien, bidder number two may then bid.  However, bidder number one will not be offered another lien until his number comes up again in the rotation.  The next lien will go to the next number in line.  Under this method, the investor has virtually no control over which liens s/he will obtain in the bidding, except to take or refuse what is offered.
# '''Bid Down the Ownership'''.  The investor willing to purchase the lien for the '''''lowest percent of encumbrance''''' on the property will be awarded the lien.  For example, a bidder may agree to take a lien on only 95% of the property.  If the lien is not redeemed, the investor would only receive 95% ownership of the property with the remaining 5% owned by the original owner.  In practice, few investors will bid on liens for less than full right to the property or sale proceeds.  Therefore, with multiple owners bidding on 100% encumbrance, the process then generally reverts to a tiebreaker method such as random selection.  (States that use this method include Iowa)

Liens not sold at auction are considered "struck" (sold) to the jurisdiction conducting the auction.  Some jurisdictions allow "over the counter" purchases of liens not sold at auction, subject to some liens being exempt from sale.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Florida allows purchases of liens struck to the various counties; however, per statute certificates for liens of less than $250 on '''homestead''' properties cannot be sold, either at the initial auction or over the counter.  See http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0100-0199/0197/Sections/0197.432.html Florida Statutes, Section 197.432(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

The investor must wait a specified period of time (commonly referred to as the "redemption period") before taking action to foreclose on the property.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in Florida the period is "two years after April 1 of the year of issuance of the tax certificate".  http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0100-0199/0197/Sections/0197.432.html Florida Statutes, Section 197.432(13).  Since Florida counties hold their sales '''''after''''' April 1 (by law, the start date for tax lien certificate sales must be no later than June 1), in Florida the redemption period is roughly 22 months after the date the certificate is sold.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the redemption period, the lien (plus interest and any other fees) may be repaid by the owner or a legal designee of the owner.&lt;ref&gt;In many jurisdictions, technically per statute only the actual property owner or a legal designee are legally permitted to redeem the lien.  In practice, though, jurisdictions usually do not strictly enforce the statute, desiring to have money in their accounts (and liens paid off to lienholders, thus creating future interest in lien sales) as well as not wanting to upset members of the public who desire to pay debts legally owed.&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually the lien holder is '''''not''''' permitted during this period to contact the property owner (or anyone else having an interest in the property, such as the mortgage holder) to demand payment or threaten foreclosure, or else the lienholder can face sanctions (such as: termination of the lien and loss of money spent, being banned from future sales, and/or criminal charges).&lt;ref&gt;For example, see http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0100-0199/0197/Sections/0197.432.html Florida Statutes, Sections 197.432(14).&lt;/ref&gt;

In some jurisdictions,&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Arizona and Colorado&lt;/ref&gt; the lienholder must agree to pay subsequent unpaid property taxes during the redemption period in order to protect his/her interest.  If the lienholder does not pay such taxes, a subsequent lienholder would "buy out" (redeem) the prior lienholder's interest.  Other jurisdictions allow the lienholder first right to pay subsequent taxes, but if the lienholder chooses not to do so, a separate lien is offered for sale.  Still other jurisdictions do not offer subsequent tax payment priority; each lien is sold separately (and can result in multiple liens on a property held by different lienholders).&lt;ref&gt;Florida falls under this category.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the redemption period is over, the lien holder may initiate foreclosure proceedings.  Normally, the cost of the proceedings will include, in addition to statutorily-mandated costs (such as application fees and costs for public notices), buy-outs of other liens and payment of any other unpaid taxes plus accrued interest.  During the period between the initiation of proceedings and actual foreclosure, the property owner still has the opportunity to repay the lien with interest plus the costs incurred to foreclose.

The foreclosure proceedings, depending on the jurisdiction, may be either:
*"self-executing": after the expiration of the redemption period the lienholder will acquire title to the property, or
*"non-self-executing": after the expiration of the redemption period the entity will conduct a tax deed sale of the property; the payments made by the lienholder constitute the opening bid and, if no other bids are received, the lienholder will acquire title to the property (the lienholder may choose to participate in the sale beyond the opening bid and make additional bids on the property if so desired).
In both cases, as with tax deed sales, title to the property will normally be in the form of a quitclaim deed, thus requiring further action to quiet title.

If the lienholder does not act within a specified period of time, as defined by state law, the lien is forfeited and the holder loses his investment.  This period of time cannot be extended unless the tax lien holder is officially in the process of foreclosing on the property or other legal action (such as bankruptcy) is pending.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in Florida a tax lien certificate must be redeemed within 7 years from the date of issuance (which is statutorily defined as the first day of the sale on which the certificate was purchased, even if the certificate was purchased after the first day), unless the lien holder has applied for a tax deed or a legal or administrative proceeding "has existed of record".  http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0100-0199/0197/Sections/0197.482.html Florida Statutes, Section 197.482.&lt;/ref&gt;

A lien issued in error of state law is repaid, but usually at a far lower interest rate than had the lien been valid.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in Florida the interest rate on an errant lien is only 8% (unless a lower rate was bid), vs. the 18% maximum rate allowed.  http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0100-0199/0197/Sections/0197.432.html Florida Statutes, Section 197.432(11),&lt;/ref&gt;

====Popularity of tax lien sales====
The popularity of tax lien sales is driven, in large part, by the maximum rate of returns offered, which can be far higher than other investments, as well as the guarantee that the governmental entity, if the lien is redeemed, will repay the investor.  Examples of such high returns include:
*Iowa, which offers a guaranteed 2% per month simple interest return (24% annual return)
*Florida, which offers a maximum rate of 18%&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0100-0199/0197/Sections/0197.432.html Florida Statutes, Section 197.432(6).&lt;/ref&gt; (with a guaranteed 5% return regardless of time held and regardless of the original rate bid, except if the rate bid was 0%)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0100-0199/0197/Sections/0197.472.html Florida Statutes, Section 197.472(2).  The 5% minimum applies to the redeemer of the certificate; however, except for the additional $6.25 certificate fee assessed at redemption per Section 197.472(3) which is paid to the county, the balance due is remitted to the lien holder.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Arizona, which offers a maximum rate of 16%&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/42/18053.htm&amp;Title=42&amp;DocType=ARS&lt;/ref&gt;

The market in tax liens has been so popular that a number of major banks and hedge funds have invested large amounts of capital in it.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-05-03/news/fl-inside-florida-tax-lien-market-20130428_1_tax-liens-tax-collector-south-florida&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pitfalls of tax lien investing====
Although the rates of return are promising, there are several pitfalls which must be taken into account before investing:

*Some jurisdictions require a large deposit at the outset of the sale, regardless of how many certificates are to be purchased or their value.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Miami-Dade County requires a $5,000 deposit, even if a buyer wants to purchase only one certificate for far less.  https://www.bidmiamidade.com/main?unique_id=vEfCeDAD5hGrBWl0dGFpSA&amp;use_this=view_faqs&lt;/ref&gt;
*Payment is usually required at purchase or within a very short time afterward (often no more than 24–72 hours).  Failure to pay the full amount results in all lien certificates purchased by the investor being cancelled, and may result in the investor losing his/her deposit and/or being barred from future sales.
*In many states, further actions must be taken to protect the lien holder's rights after purchase of a lien, which require additional costs beyond the original investment (and the costs may or may not be repaid upon redemption).  In addition, the actions must be performed within a certain period of time and in strict accordance with legal requirements; failure to comply exactly with such requirements may make the lien worthless and the investment lost.
*In "bid down the interest" jurisdictions, valuable properties are usually bid to the lowest rate possible greater than zero percent.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Florida permits the interest rate to be bid down in 0.25% increments to as low as a minuscule 0.25% &amp;ndash; though it guarantees a minimum 5% return &amp;ndash; while Arizona allows the bid to be bid down in 1% increments to as low as 1%.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, in "premium" states, valuable properties are bid up above the means of an average investor, and further depending on the jurisdiction the premium may not be repaid.
*Unlike a [[certificate of deposit]], tax liens are illiquid. They cannot be "cashed in" (resold to the taxing authority), but must be held until either they are repaid or the holder takes action to foreclose. (It is possible to sell or assign one's interest in a tax lien to another party; such transfers usually require a fee to do so.  However, the acquiring party may or may not wish to purchase the lien for the original amount.)
*Though touted as a means of obtaining property at very low cost, in practice liens are nearly always paid off prior to the auction date, and in those cases where the property is placed for auction, it is usually sold at a higher price than the original minimum bid of the lien, accrued interest, and costs of sale.
*As with tax deed sales, title to property is obtained via a form of quitclaim deed, thus requiring further action to quiet title.
*As with tax deed sales, a property obtained via tax lien may still be subject to other liens and assessments on the property which are not extinguished at sale, which (along with any accrued interest) can, in some instances, exceed the value of the property itself, making it virtually worthless.

'''Universal language''' may refer to a hypothetical or historical language spoken and understood by all or most of the world's population.  In some contexts, it refers to a means of communication said to be understood by all living things, beings, and objects alike.  It may be the idea of an [[international auxiliary language]] for communication between groups speaking different primary languages.  In other conceptions, it may be the primary language of all speakers, or the only existing language.   Some religious and mythological traditions state that there was once a single universal language among all people, or shared by humans and [[supernatural]] beings.

In other traditions, there is less interest in or a general deflection of the question. For example in [[Islam]] the [[Arabic language]] is the language of the [[Qur'an]], and so universal for Muslims. The written [[Classical Chinese|Classical Chinese language]] was and is still read widely but pronounced differently by readers in [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]; for centuries it was a ''[[de facto]]'' universal ''literary'' language for a broad-based culture. In something of the same way [[Sanskrit]] in [[India]] and [[Nepal]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] in [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Pali]] in [[Sri Lanka]] and in [[Theravada]] countries of [[South-East Asia]] ([[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]]), were literary languages for many for whom they were not their [[mother tongue]].

Comparably, the [[Latin|Latin language]] (''qua'' [[Medieval Latin]]) was in effect a universal language of [[Intellectual|literati]] in the [[Middle Ages]], and the language of the [[Vulgate Bible]] in the area of [[Catholicism]], which covered most of Western [[Europe]] and parts of Northern and Central Europe also.

In a more practical fashion, trade languages, such as ancient [[Koine Greek]], may be seen as a kind of ''real'' universal language, that was used for commerce.

In [[historical linguistics]], [[monogenesis (linguistics)|monogenesis]] refers to the idea that all spoken human languages are descended from a single ancestral language spoken many thousands of years ago.

==Mythological and religious universal languages==
{{main|Mythical origins of language|Adamic language|Divine language|Language of the birds}}
Various religious texts, myths, and legends describe a state of humanity in which originally only one language was spoken.

In [[Jews|Jewish]] and [[Christian]] beliefs, the story of the [[Tower of Babel]] tells of a consequent "[[confusion of tongues]]" (the splintering of numerous languages from an original [[Adamic language]]) as a punishment from God.

Myths exist in other cultures describing the creation of multiple languages as an act of a god as well, such as the destruction of a 'knowledge tree' by [[Brahma]] in Indic tradition, or as a gift from the God [[Hermes]] in Greek myth. Other myths describe the creation of different languages as concurrent with the creation of different tribes of people, or due to supernatural events.

== Early modern history ==
{{further|Philosophical language}}
Recognizable strands in the contemporary ideas on universal languages took form only in [[Early Modern]] Europe. A ''[[lingua franca]]'' or trade language was nothing very new; but  an [[international auxiliary language]] was a natural wish in light of the gradual decline of Latin. Literature in vernacular languages became more prominent with the [[Renaissance]]. Over the course of the 18th century, learned works largely ceased to be written in [[Latin]]. According to Colton Booth (''Origin and Authority in Seventeenth-Century England'' (1994) p.&amp;nbsp;174) "The Renaissance had no single view of Adamic language and its relation to human understanding." The question was more exactly posed in the work of [[Francis Bacon]].

In the vast writings of [[Gottfried Leibniz]] can be found many elements relating to a possible universal language, specifically a [[constructed language]], a concept that gradually came to replace that of a rationalized Latin as the natural basis for a projected universal language. Leibniz conceived of a ''[[characteristica universalis]]'' (also see ''[[mathesis universalis]]''), an "algebra" capable of expressing all conceptual thought. This algebra would include rules for symbolic manipulation, what he called a ''[[calculus ratiocinator]]'' . His goal was to put [[reasoning]] on a firmer basis by reducing much of it to a matter of calculation that many could grasp. The ''characteristica'' would build on an [[alphabet of human thought]].

Leibniz's work is bracketed by some earlier mathematical ideas of [[René Descartes]], and the satirical attack of [[Voltaire]] on [[Panglossianism]]. Descartes's ambitions were far more modest than Leibniz's, and also far more successful, as shown by his wedding of [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] to yield what we now know as [[analytic geometry]]. Decades of research on [[symbolic artificial intelligence]] have not brought Leibniz's dream of a ''characteristica'' any closer to fruition.

Other 17th-century proposals for a 'philosophical' (i.e. universal) language include those by [[Francis Lodwick]], [[Thomas Urquhart]] (possibly parodic), [[George Dalgarno]] (''Ars signorum'', 1661), and [[John Wilkins]] (''[[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language]]'', 1668). The classification scheme in [[Peter Mark Roget|Roget]]'s [[Thesaurus]] ultimately derives from Wilkins's ''Essay''.

''[[Candide]]'', a [[satire]] written by [[Voltaire]], took aim at Leibniz as [[Dr. Pangloss]], with the choice of name clearly putting universal language in his sights, but satirizing mainly the [[optimism]] of the projector as much as the project. The argument takes the universal language itself no more seriously than the ideas  of the speculative scientists and ''virtuosi'' of [[Jonathan Swift]]'s [[Laputa]]. For the like-minded of Voltaire's generation, universal language was tarred as [[fool's gold]] with the same brush as [[philology]] with little [[intellectual rigour]], and universal [[mythography]], as futile and arid directions.

In the 18th century, some rationalist natural philosophers sought to recover a supposed [[Edenic language]]. It was assumed that education inevitably took people away from an innate state of goodness they possessed, and therefore there was an attempt to see what language a human child brought up in utter silence would speak. This was assumed to be the Edenic tongue, or at least the [[lapsarian]] tongue.

Others attempted to find a common linguistic ancestor to all tongues; there were, therefore, multiple attempts to relate esoteric languages to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] (e.g. [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Irish language|Irish]]), as well as the beginnings of [[comparative linguistics]].

==Modern history==
{{Further|World language}}
At the end of the 19th century, there was a large profusion of constructed languages intended as genuine, spoken language. There were created languages which don't belong to any country and can be learned by everyone. Among these are [[Solresol]], [[Volapük language|Volapük]], and [[Esperanto]], the most spoken constructed language nowadays. At that time, those ideas were readily accepted. With the advent of World Wars and the Cold War, these successes were buried. {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The constructed language movement produced such languages as  [[Latino Sine Flexione]] (1903), [[Ido (language)|Ido]] (1907), [[Occidental language|Occidental]] (1922), and [[Interlingua]] (1951).&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Gode|Gode, Alexander]], ''[[Interlingua-English Dictionary|Interlingua: A Dictionary of the International Language]]'', New York: Storm Publishers, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

English remains the dominant language of international business and global communication through the influence of global media and the former British Empire that had established the use of English in regions around the world such as North America, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. However, English is not the only language used in global organizations such as in the EU or the UN, because many countries do not recognize English as a universal language.

The early ideas of a universal language with complete conceptual classification by categories is still debated on various levels. [[Michel Foucault]] believed such classifications to be subjective, citing [[Borges]]' fictional [[Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge's Taxonomy]] as an illustrative example.

'''Victor Rodrigues''' ({{lang-knn|विक्टर रोद्रिगुएस &lt;small&gt;([[Devanagari]])&lt;/small&gt;, ವಿಕ್ಟೊರ್ ರೋದ್ರಿಗುಎಸ್ &lt;small&gt;([[Kannada script|Kannada]])&lt;/small&gt;}}; 8 February 1944&amp;nbsp;– 5 July 2010) was a Konkani novelist and short story writer from [[Mangalore]], India. He was among the most prominent novelists in the field of Konkani literature.&lt;ref name="sa1"&gt;{{harvnb|George|1992|p=[https://books.google.com.bh/books?id=m1R2Pa3f7r0C&amp;pg=PA217#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 217]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodrigues specialised in writing serialised novels of extraordinary length running into more than 150 chapters.&lt;ref name="vjp2"&gt;{{harvnb|Sardesai|2000|p=[https://books.google.com.bh/books?id=1YILeUD_oZUC&amp;pg=PA257#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 257]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Victor Rodrigues was born in the Anjelore locality of Mangalore, the eldest child of four children to a [[Mangalorean Catholics|Mangalorean Catholic]] couple, Anthony and Charmine Rodrigues. While he successfully graduated high school, the family's poverty prevented him from enrolling in a college.&lt;ref name="Mithr"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his high school graduation, Rodrigues joined Simon &amp; Company and worked as a painter, where he worked for a short period. He then sought a career in painting, after having learnt painting and art from a drawing master of [[St. Aloysius College (Mangalore)|St. Aloysius College]] named Peter. He received a job at Fr. Mullers Hospital in 1960, where he worked until 1972. Rodrigues later migrated to [[Bahrain]] in 1975, where he worked until 1995.&lt;ref name="Anjelore"/&gt; He was married to Celine D'Souza. The union lasted until his death and produced three children—Lolita, Veena and Santhosh.&lt;ref name="Anjelore"/&gt;

== Literary career ==

While was working at Fr.  Mullers Hospital, Rodrigues began his literary career writing for ''Mithr'' (Friend) and ''Jhelo'' (Garland), respectively Konkani weekly and fortnightly. He wrote his first novel ''Vibhadlelen Gharane'' (Ruined Family) in 1967 for the Konkani periodicals, ''Mithr'' and ''Jhelo''. He wrote his first health related article on the topic of breast cancer which was published on ''Jhelo''.&lt;ref name="Anjelore"/&gt; During his literary tenure, Rodrigues wrote 23 novels,&lt;ref name="Mithr"/&gt; the most notable being ''Andhkarachea Khondkant'' (Fond of Darkness), ''Rogtachi Bobatt'' (Bloodcurdling Screams), ''Don Max'' and ''Paap ani Shiraap'' (Sin and Curse).&lt;ref name="Poinnari"&gt;{{cite web

Rodrigues's stories highlighted his revolutionary views and were usually directed against perceived social evils and social customs and systems, which he found degrading.&lt;ref name="Anjelore"/&gt; He penned his articles with the purpose of creating awareness about social justice.&lt;ref name="Mithr"/&gt;
His novel, ''Pratikar'' was serialised in the Konkani weekly, ''Poinnari,'' for almost 198 weeks, while ''Paap ani Shiraap'' ran for 219 weeks.&lt;ref name="Poinnari"/&gt; Apart from his novels, he wrote six plays and two biographies of Catholic priests, Fr. Sylvester Menezes and Fr. Marian Fernandes. Rodrigues also wrote a book on traditional medicines, entitled ''Bholaike Daiz'' (Treasure of Health).&lt;ref name="Poinnari"/&gt; His famous serial story, ''Paap ani Shiraap'' was selected by 'Mangalore Tele Films' for the first Konkani TV mega serial.&lt;ref name="Anjelore"/&gt; It was telecasted on DD Chandana channel under the title ''Kanni Ashi Mogachi'' (A Hopeful Love Story).&lt;ref name="Poinnari"/&gt;

Rodrigues was honoured by Karnataka Konkani Sahitya Akademi for his contribution to literature, in the year 2000. He also received the Daiji Dubai Award in 2006, and Francis Danthy Literary Award the same year.&lt;ref name="Poinnari"/&gt;

'''Vinod Kumar Shukla''' (born 1 January 1937) commonly known as VK Shukla is a modern [[Hindi]] writer known for his style that often borders on [[magic-realism]]. His works include the novels ''Naukar ki Kameez'' (which has been made into the film ''[[Naukar Ki Kameez]]'' by [[Mani Kaul]]) and ''Deewar Mein Ek Khirkee Rahati Thi'' (''A Window lived in a Wall''), which won the [[Sahitya Akademi]] Award for the best Hindi work in 1999.

== Life and work ==
He was born on 1 January 1937 in [[Rajnandgaon]], Chhattisgarh (then [[Madhya Pradesh]]). His first collection of poems ''Lagbhag Jai Hind'' was published in 1971. ''Vah Aadmi Chala Gaya Naya Garam Coat Pehankar Vichar Ki Tarah'' was his second collection of poems, published in 1981 by [[Sambhavna Prakashan]]. ''Naukar Ki Kameez''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 =Khanna | first1 = Satti | title =Modern Hindi Short Stories | date = | publisher = Har-Anand Publications | location = | isbn =  | page =  | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rS_qXVNdvnIC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=Naukar+Ki+Kameez&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=prdVTJOnDJCGrQeH_dDzAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Naukar%20Ki%20Kameez&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;(The Servant's Shirt) was his first novel, brought out in 1979 by the same publisher. ''Per Par Kamra'' (Room on the Tree), a collection of short stories, was brought out in 1988, and another collection of poems in 1992, ''Sab Kuch Hona Bacha Rahega''.

Vinod Kumar Shukla was a guest littérateur at the Nirala Srijanpeeth in AGRA from 1994 to 1996 during which he wrote two novels ''Khilega To Dekhenge'' and the refreshing ''Deewar Mein Ek Khirkee Rahati Thi''. The latter has been translated into English by Prof. Satti Khanna of [[Duke University]] as  ''A Window Lived in a Wall''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 =Kumar Shukla| first1 = Vinod  |  title =Deevar Mein Ek Khidki Rahti Thi | date = | publisher = Sahitya Akademi| location = New Delhi | isbn =  | page =  |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eQ-dlQfFMkUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Publisher : Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi, 2005). He was presented an artists' residency by Ektara - Takshila's Centre for Children's Literature &amp; Art where he produced a novel for Young Adults called "Ek Chuppi Jagah" &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ektaraindia.in/product/ek-chuppi-jagah/&lt;/ref&gt;.

He did his M.Sc. in agriculture from [[Jawaharlal Nehru Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya]] (JNKVV) in [[Jabalpur]] wherafter he joined as lecturer in Agriculture College Raipur.{{cn|date=July 2017}} He was inspired considerably by the poet [[Gajanan Madhav Muktibodh|Muktibodh]] who was then a lecturer in Hindi at Digvijay College Rajnandgaon where Padumlal Punnalal Buxy was also working. Baldeo Prasad Mishra was also at Rajnandgaon at the same period.

Vinod Kumar Shukl's poems have been widely translated. In 2015, Delhi-based author Akhil Katyal translated Shukl's 'Hatasha se ek vyakti baith gaya' into English:

{{cquote|Desperate, a man sat down,


I didn't know him, 

I knew desperation,

so I went close to him

and reached out my hand –

holding it, he stood up,

he didn't know me, he knew 

my reaching out the hand,

from there, we walked together,

neither of us knew the other –

both knew walking together.}}

In [[mathematics]], an expression is called '''well-defined''' or ''unambiguous'' if its definition assigns it a unique interpretation or value. Otherwise, the expression is said to be ''not well-defined'' or ''ambiguous''.&lt;ref name="MathWorld"&gt;{{cite web | last = Weisstein | first = Eric W. | title = Well-Defined | publisher = From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource | url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Well-Defined.html | accessdate = 2 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A function is well-defined if it gives the same result when the representation of the input is changed without changing the value of the input. For instance if ''f'' takes real numbers as input, and if ''f''(0.5) does not equal ''f''(1/2) then ''f'' is not well-defined (and thus: not a function).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph J. Rotman, ''The Theory of Groups: an Introduction'', p.&amp;nbsp;287 "... a function is "single-valued," or, as we prefer to say ... a function is ''well defined''.", Allyn and Bacon, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''well-defined'' is also used to indicate whether a logical statement is unambiguous.

A function that is not well-defined is not the same as a function that is [[undefined (mathematics)|undefined]]. For example, if ''f''(''x'') = 1/''x'', then ''f''(0) is undefined, but this has nothing to do with the question of whether ''f''(''x'') = 1/''x'' is well-defined.  It is; 0 is simply not in the domain of the function.

==Example==
Let &lt;math&gt;A_0,A_1&lt;/math&gt; be sets, let &lt;math&gt;A = A_0 \cup A_1&lt;/math&gt; and "define" &lt;math&gt;f: A \rightarrow \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;f(a)=0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;a \in A_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(a)=1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;a \in A_1&lt;/math&gt;.

Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is well-defined if &lt;math&gt;A_0 \cap A_1 = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. This is e.&amp;nbsp;g. the case when &lt;math&gt;A_0:=\{2,4\}, A_1:=\{3,5\}&lt;/math&gt; (then ''f''(''a'') happens to be [[Modulo operation|&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{mod}(a,2)&lt;/math&gt;]]).

If however &lt;math&gt;A_0 \cap A_1 \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not well-defined because &lt;math&gt;f(a)&lt;/math&gt; is "ambiguous" for &lt;math&gt;a \in A_0 \cap A_1&lt;/math&gt;. This is e.&amp;nbsp;g. the case when &lt;math&gt;A_0:=\{2\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_1:=\{2\}&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, &lt;math&gt;A_0 \cap A_1=\{2\}\ni 2&lt;/math&gt; and ''f''(2) would have to be 0 as well as 1, which is impossible. Therefore, the latter ''f'' is not well-defined and thus not a function.

=="Definition" as anticipation of definition==
In order to avoid the apostrophes around "define" in the previous simple example, the "definition" of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; could be broken down into two simple logical steps:
{{ordered list
| ''The definition'' of the &lt;ins&gt;[[binary relation]]&lt;/ins&gt;: In the example
:&lt;math&gt;f := \bigl\{(a,i) \mid i \in \{0,1\} \wedge a \in A_i \bigr\} &lt;/math&gt;,
(which so far is nothing but a certain subset of the [[Cartesian product]] &lt;math&gt;A \times \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.)
| ''The assertion'': The binary relation &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;ins&gt;function&lt;/ins&gt;; in the example
:&lt;math&gt;f: A \rightarrow \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.
}}
Whereas the definition in step 1. is formulated with the freedom of any definition and is certainly effective (without the need to classify it as „well-defined“), the assertion in step 2. has to be proved: If and only if &lt;math&gt;A_0 \cap A_1 = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, we get a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, and the &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of "definition" is well-defined (as a function).

On the other hand: if &lt;math&gt;A_0 \cap A_1 \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; then for an &lt;math&gt;a \in A_0 \cap A_1&lt;/math&gt; there is both, &lt;math&gt;(a,0) \in f&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' &lt;math&gt;(a,1) \in f&lt;/math&gt;, and the binary relation &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not ''functional'' as defined in [[Binary relation#Special types of binary relations]] and thus not well-defined (as a function). Colloquially, the "function" &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called ambiguous at point &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; (although there is ''per definitionem'' never an "ambiguous function"), and the original "definition" is pointless.

Despite these subtle logical problems, it is quite common to anticipatorily use the term definition (without apostrophes) for "definitions" of this kind, firstly because it is sort of a short-hand of the two-step approach, secondly because the relevant mathematical reasoning (step 2.) is the same in both cases, and finally because in mathematical texts the assertion is «up to 100%» true.

==Independence of representative==
The question of well-definedness of a function classically arises when the defining equation of a function does not (only) refer to the arguments themselves, but (also) to elements of the arguments. This is sometimes unavoidable when the arguments are [[coset]]s and the equation refers to coset representatives.

===Functions with one argument===
For example, consider the following function
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
f : &amp; \Z/8\Z         &amp; \to     &amp; \Z/4\Z\\
    &amp; \overline{n}_8 &amp; \mapsto &amp; \overline{n}_4,
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;n\in\Z, m\in \{4,8\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Z/m\Z&lt;/math&gt; are the [[modulo arithmetic|integers modulo ''m'']] and &lt;math&gt;\overline{n}_m&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[modulo arithmetic#Congruence classes|congruence class]] of ''n'' mod ''m''.

N.B.: &lt;math&gt;\overline{n}_4&lt;/math&gt; is a reference to the element &lt;math&gt;n \in \overline{n}_8&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\overline{n}_8&lt;/math&gt; is the argument of ''f''.

The function ''f'' is well-defined, because
:&lt;math&gt;n \equiv n' \operatorname{mod} 8 \; \Leftrightarrow \; 8\mid(n-n')  \; \Leftrightarrow \; 2\cdot 4\mid(n-n') \; \Rightarrow \; 4\mid(n-n') \; \Leftrightarrow \; n \equiv n' \operatorname{mod} 4.&lt;/math&gt;

===Operations===
In particular, the term well-defined is used with respect to (binary) [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s on cosets. In this case one can view the operation as a function of two variables and the property of being well-defined is the same as that for a function. For example, addition on the integers modulo some ''n'' can be defined naturally in terms of integer addition. 
:&lt;math&gt;[a]\oplus[b] = [a+b]&lt;/math&gt;
The fact that this is well-defined follows from the fact that we can write any representative of &lt;math&gt;[a]&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;a+kn&lt;/math&gt;, where k is an integer. Therefore, 
:&lt;math&gt;[a+kn]\oplus[b] = [(a+kn)+b] = [(a+b)+kn] = [a+b] = [a]\oplus [b];&lt;/math&gt;
and similarly for any representative of &lt;math&gt;[b]&lt;/math&gt;.

==Well-defined notation==
For real numbers, the product &lt;math&gt;a \times b \times c&lt;/math&gt; is unambiguous because &lt;math&gt;(a \times b)\times c = a \times (b \times c)&lt;/math&gt;. (Therefore, the notation is said to be ''well-defined''.&lt;ref name="MathWorld"/&gt;) Because of this property of the [[operation (mathematics)|operation]] (here &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;), which is known as [[associativity]], the result does not depend on the sequence of multiplications, so that a specification of the sequence can be omitted.

The [[subtraction]] operation, &lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;, is not associative. However, there is a convention (or definition) in that the &lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt; operation is understood as addition of the opposite, thus &lt;math&gt;a-b-c&lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;a + (-b) + (-c)&lt;/math&gt;, and is called "well-defined".

[[Division (mathematics)|Division]] is also non-associative. However, in the case of &lt;math&gt;a/b/c&lt;/math&gt; the convention &lt;math&gt;/b := *b^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is not so well established, so this expression is considered '''ill-defined'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.

Unlike with functions, the notational ambiguities can be overcome more or less easily by means of additional definitions, i.&amp;nbsp;e. rules of [[Operator precedence|precedence]], and/or associativity of the operators. In the programming language [[C (programming language)|C]] e.&amp;nbsp;g. the operator &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; for subtraction is ''left-to-right-associative'' which means that &lt;code&gt;a-b-c&lt;/code&gt; is defined as &lt;code&gt;(a-b)-c&lt;/code&gt; and the operator &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; for assignment is ''right-to-left-associative'' which means that &lt;code&gt;a=b=c&lt;/code&gt; is defined as &lt;code&gt;a=(b=c)&lt;/code&gt;. In the programming language [[APL (programming language)|APL]] there is only one rule: from [[APL (programming language)#Design|right to left]] − but parentheses first.

==Other uses of the term==
A solution to a [[partial differential equation]] is said to be well-defined if it is determined by the boundary conditions in a continuous way as the boundary conditions are changed.&lt;ref name="MathWorld" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11680">The '''Writer's Workbench''' ('''wwb''') was a software package developed for the Unix operating system by [[Lorinda Cherry]] and Nina McDonald of [[Bell Labs]].&lt;ref name=computers-come-of-age/&gt;&lt;ref name="raskin-credit"/&gt; It was perhaps the earliest [[grammar checker]] to receive wide usage on [[Unix]] systems.&lt;ref name="hnlp"/&gt;

==Capabilities==
wwb's utilities were capable of analysing text for [[parts of speech]], and for word and sentence length, and of comparing the results to established norms.&lt;ref name="costanzo-mech"/&gt;

The Writer's Workbench was meant to help students learn to edit their work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;My feeling about a lot of those tools is their value in education is as much pointing out to people who are learning to write that they have choices and make choices when they do it. They don’t think of a writing task as making choices per se. Once they get it on paper they think it’s cast in stone. So it makes them edit.&lt;ref name=oral-history-unix/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Polling at [[Colorado State University]] in the 1980s indicated that wwb was well received by students and faculty.&lt;ref name="costanzo-polls"/&gt; Additional analysis in the 1980s indicated close correlation between wwb's assessments and essay grading rubrics.&lt;ref name="costanzo-polls"/&gt;

==Package contents==
As of 1983, the wwb package contained 29 utilities.&lt;ref name="infoworld"/&gt; As of 1986, this had increased to around 35-40 utilities.&lt;ref name="raskin-utilities"/&gt; wwb's utilities included '''style''' and '''diction'''.&lt;ref name="dsl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gehani"/&gt; It also included a "word choice checker",&lt;ref name="pfaffenberger-choice"/&gt; and a program to help users avoid sexist language.&lt;ref name="infoworld"/&gt;

==History and successors==
The wwb package was included with [[AT&amp;T UNIX]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s and received wide distribution as a result.&lt;ref name="dsl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pfaffenberger-origins"/&gt; However, wwb was not included with [[Version 7 Unix]], and gradually became [[abandonware]].&lt;ref name="dsl"/&gt; Various successors arose, based closely upon wwb, such as the commercial ''[[Grammatik]]'' packages for [[IBM PC]]s.&lt;ref name="grammatik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hnlp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pfaffenberger-origins"/&gt;

The [[GNU/Linux]] operating system contains [[free software]] implementations of several wwb utilities, such as '''look''', '''spell''', '''style''' and '''diction'''.&lt;ref name="dsl"/&gt;

&lt;ref name="costanzo-mech"&gt;{{harvnb|Costanzo|1989|pp=145-146}}: "''Writer's Workbench'' works primarily by counting and comparing. It counts the number of letters in a word (or words in a sentence) and compares the figures to established norms, then calculates a text's 'readability,' it's probability of being understood by a given audience. By matching the text against a data base of linguistic information, the computer identifies parts of speech, possible misspellings, and potential usage problems. The programming tricks for doing this are ingenious, but ultimately limited. What ''Writer's Workbench'' tells writers about the quality of their prose is based chiefly on quantifiable data."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="costanzo-polls"&gt;{{harvnb|Costanzo|1989|pp=157-158}}: "Kiefer and Sutherland polled students who used ''Writer's Workbench'' at Colorado State University, finding that student attitudes toward the program were positive, often enthusiastic (1984). They also polled participating faculty, who generally agreed that the program sensitized their students to the kinds of errors and stylistic weaknesses they stressed in their grading. But what about the ''quality'' of the writing? Reid and Findlay examined the relationships between holistically-scored essays and various stylistic features measured by ''Writer's Workbench'' (1986). They expected to find high correlations between the better essays and the more sophisticated elements of style, such as sentence structure, vocabulary, and parts of speech. Instead, the relatively simple quantitative measurements, like sentence length, word length, essay length, spelling, and readability, turned out to be more significant. This in itself is an intriguing finding. It suggests that the most important outcome of such studies may be what they reveal about our grading policies, not about our software."&lt;/ref&gt;

AT&amp;T therefore gave UNIX (often with Writer's Workbench) to many colleges and universities, and a generation of programmers and computer freaks grew up with it.
