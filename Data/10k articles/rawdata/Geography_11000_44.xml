'''Austria''' ([[minor planet designation]]: '''136 Austria''') is a [[main-belt]] [[asteroid]] that was found by the prolific asteroid discoverer [[Johann Palisa]] on 18 March 1874, from the [[Austrian Naval Observatory]] in [[Pula|Pola]], [[Istria County|Istria]].&lt;ref name="Albrecht2001"/&gt; It was his first asteroid discovery and was given the Latin name of his [[Austria-Hungary|homeland]].

Based upon its spectrum, it is classified as an [[M-type asteroid|M-type spectrum]], although Clark et al. (1994) suggest it may be more like an [[S-type asteroid]].&lt;ref name="Clark1994"/&gt; It shows almost no absorption features in the near infrared, which may indicate an iron or [[enstatite chondrite]] surface composition. A weak hydration feature was detected in 2006.&lt;ref name="Hardersen1983"/&gt;

[[Photometry (astronomy)|Photometric]] observations of this asteroid at the [[European Southern Observatory]] in 1981 gave a [[light curve]] with a period of 11.5 ± 0.1 hours and a brightness variation of 0.40 in [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]].&lt;ref name="Schober1983"/&gt; As of 2013, the estimated rotation period is 11.4969&lt;ref name="Behrend"/&gt; hours.

'''40 Devonshire Street''' is a [[grade II listed]] [[town house]] in [[Devonshire Street]], in the [[City of Westminster]], London.

The house was built around 1910 in red brick with stone dressings in the [[arts and crafts]] Georgian revival style on a tall stone [[plinth]]. It was part of an attempt by the [[Portland Estate]] to revive the residential character of the area which they felt had become too professional.&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1356986|desc=40, Devonshire Street|accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is current used as the health office of the [[Embassy of Kuwait in London]].

The '''A494''' is a [[trunk road]] in [[Wales]]. The route, which is officially known as the '''Dolgellau to South of Birkenhead Trunk Road''', runs between the terminus of the [[M56 motorway]] between [[Mollington, Cheshire|Mollington]] and [[Capenhurst]] and the [[A470 road|A470]] at [[Dolgellau]], [[Gwynedd]]. Its northern sections remain among the busiest roads in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7687340.stm|title=Politicians ponder future of A494 |publisher=[[BBC NEWS]]|date=24 October 2008|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original routes into North Wales meant using [[Ford (crossing)|ford]]s when the Dee estuary was at low tide north west of [[Chester]]. But when the river was [[River Dee, Wales#Canalised section|canalised in the 1730s]] several new coach roads were laid out through [[Sealand, Flintshire|Sealand]], [[Shotton, Flintshire|Shotton]] and [[Queensferry, Flintshire|Queensferry]]. These were built by the Dee Company under the River Dee Act of 1743 to serve the hand-operated ferries which had replaced the fords.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpat.org.uk/projects/longer/ports/ports.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1861 the ferry at Shotton was steam operated, with an engine house on the Queensferry side. In 1897 the ferry was replaced by an innovative [[retractable bridge]] because of increasing mechanised transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=57309|title=ROADS AND ROAD TRANSPORT|publisher=British History Online|date=2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpat.org.uk/projects/longer/ports/ports.htm|title=	
Ports and Harbours in North-east Wales|publisher=The Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust|date=2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen Victoria Jubilee Toll Bridge, which was built from iron, stone and wood, could retract its middle sections for the passage of river traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-east-wales-25444392|title=Connah's Quay dock revival and tall ships funding bid|publisher=[[BBC NEWS]]|date=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the early 1920s, increasing numbers of motor vehicles and the narrowness of the bridge made the area notorious for traffic congestion. These issues prompted its replacement.

[[File:Stone Abutment for the Old Queensferry Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 410716.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The stone abutment for the Queensferry bridge]]
In 1926 a rolling [[bascule bridge]], called the New Jubilee Bridge, was opened by the [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]] for the newly named A494. Its design allowed river traffic to use the wharfs at [[Saltney]]. The original bridge was demolished although the stone abutments can still be seen today. 
The steel bridge remained the sole road crossing at Queensferry until the late 1950s. 

But its size and design had limitations, a news report at the time stated it "is barely wide enough for two lines of vehicles, and five-mile traffic jams are normal".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,869049,00.html Time Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the late 1960s, the A494 was upgraded to a dual carriageway from Drome corner. The original route through Shotton and Queensferry was bypassed after a wider fixed-arched bridge was constructed across the River Dee. This was facilitated by reduction of larger river traffic following the closure of the sea-going wharfs at Saltney.

The present route had remained unchanged until a lane upgrade in 2004.

==Queensferry to Ewloe==

This section forms part of the [[North Wales]] coast route between [[Holyhead]] and the [[M56 motorway]]. The section of the A494 north of the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]] was upgraded to 4-lanes plus hard shoulders in each direction in 2004 as part of a wider scheme, which upgraded the [[A550 road|A550]] as well, although not all of the lanes on the A494 have been opened. 

The next stage of the scheme was to widen a {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of the A494 from the River Dee up Aston Hill to the ''[[Ewloe]] Interchange'', the junction of the [[A55 road|A55]] and A494, to 3 and 4-lane plus hard shoulder standard.  

In April 2006, local residents living at Aston Hill, part of the proposed route, began a campaign to oppose any further widening of the A494.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/north_east/6246209.stm | work=BBC News | title=Protest over road-widening plans | date=2007-01-10 | accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 15 months, protesters' high-profile message had garnered more than 2300 individual letters and numerous petitions rejecting the proposals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eveningleader.co.uk/news?articleid=3014612 Mass protest call by A494 campaigners - Evening Leader&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Planning Inquiry was held in September - October 2007. 

In March 2008 the proposals (in entirety) were ordered to be scrapped by the Ieuan Wyn Jones, Deputy First Minister, responsible for Transport at the Welsh Assembly.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In reaching my decision I have taken account of the concerns raised by the inspector that the overall size of the scheme would have a significant impact on the landscape and would affect walking and cycling routes. I have also noted [the planning inspector's] remarks that while he considers that this section of the A494 will need some form of improvement in the foreseeable future, he considers that the scale of the scheme as originally proposed is greater than required."        [[Ieuan Wyn Jones|Deputy First Minister Ieuan Wyn Jones]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7315973.stm Welsh Minister rejects plans]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This part of the A494 will remain a two-lane dual carriageway and the speed limit will be {{convert|50|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The decision has left a question mark over the future of the remaining upgrade at ''Ewloe Interchange''.

Resentment also remains within the Aston Hill community as thirty households were evicted from their homes earlier in the scheme. These houses were earmarked to be demolished to make way for the road-widening works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eveningleader.co.uk/news/Evicted-man-slams-Welsh-Assembly.3925046.jp |title=Evicted man slams Welsh Assembly over scrapped A494 plans - Evening Leader&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=16 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513141554/http://www.eveningleader.co.uk/news/Evicted-man-slams-Welsh-Assembly.3925046.jp |archive-date=13 May 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; No decision has been made about the future of these properties.

==Ewloe to Corwen==
Just past Ewloe interchange the [[A55 road|A55]] converges with the A494. At this point the dual carriageway becomes the A55 and the A494 diverges onto a single-carriageway trunk road. This section is approximately {{convert|25|mi}} in length. It is largely national speed limit with exceptions through urbanised areas.

The A494, which follows a largely unchanged historic route, passes [[Mold, Flintshire|Mold]] through the [[Clwydian Range|Clwydian Mountains]], down to [[Ruthin]] and on to the market town of [[Corwen]]. Although it follows the traditional coach route, work has been undertaken over many decades to improve various sections of this road. For instance a bypass was completed in 1999 to allow traffic to avoid Mold's town centre. Likewise a dangerous road junction for [[Moel Famau]], just outside [[Loggerheads, Denbighshire|Loggerheads]], that was on a bend and blind brow has now been completely bypassed. 

The A494 enters [[Ruthin]] by traversing the steep side of the Vale of Clwyd. Beyond the town, it heads south through several small villages. Beside the road for much of the way is the disused [[Denbigh, Ruthin and Corwen Railway|Ruthin to Corwen Railway line]]. The A494, up to this point, often remains [[Traffic congestion|congestion]]-free as a lot of traffic follows the parallel shorter [[A5104 road|A5104]] between the A55 and Corwen around Llantysilio Mountain.

The A494 meets the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5 trunk road]] at a [[T-junction]] just outside Corwen. It now makes a short {{convert|1.5|mi}} [[Concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with the A5 to Druid.

==Druid to Dolgellau==
[[File:Bala High Street.jpg|thumb|200px|The A494 through the centre of [[Bala, Gwynedd|Bala]], [[Gwynedd]].]]
The A494 diverges from the concurrency with the A5 at the road junction at Druid, [[Denbighshire]]. It then heads south west for {{convert|27|mi}} to [[Dolgellau]], [[Gwynedd]]. 

This section of the A494 remains single carriageway. It has variable speed limits. [[North Wales Police]] regularly conduct traffic operations on this road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denbighshirefreepress.co.uk/news/Police-are-driving-bikers-away.5200518.jp Police are driving bikers 'away' from North Wales]{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} accessdate=2009-05-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The A494 enters the [[Snowdonia National Park]] just outside the market town of [[Bala, Gwynedd|Bala]]. It then runs adjacent to [[Bala Lake]] ({{lang-cy|Llyn Tegid}}) for {{convert|4|mi}} and past [[Aran Fawddwy]]. 

Beyond the southwest end of the lake, at the summit of the pass at Pant Gwyn, the A494 enters a long steeply graded valley that follows the River Wnion ({{lang-cy|Afon Wnion}}) to [[Dolgellau]]. Again a [[Ruabon to Barmouth Line|former railway]] also runs parallel with the road. The remains of the line can be seen in places. 

The A494 terminates at a T-junction with the [[A470 road|A470]] just outside the [[market town]] of Dolgellau beneath [[Cadair Idris]].

{{pp-pc1|small=yes}}
In [[biology]] and [[ecology]], '''abiotic components''' or '''abiotic factors''' are non-living chemical and [[Physical property|physical]] parts of the [[Natural environment|environment]] that affect living [[organism]]s and the functioning of [[ecosystem]]s. Abiotic factors and the phenomena associated with them underpin all biology. 

Abiotic components include physical conditions and non-living [[Resource (biology)|resources]] that affect living organisms in terms of [[Developmental biology|growth]], [[Maintenance of an organism|maintenance]], and [[reproduction]].  Resources are distinguished as substances or objects in the environment required by one organism and consumed or otherwise made unavailable for use by other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs, R.E. 2005.

Springer, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Abiotic Factors.tif|thumb|These are different settings on earth that are abiotic factors, which mean they are not living organisms, that contribute to the earth in many different ways.]]
Component degradation of a substance occurs by [[chemical process|chemical]] or [[Physical change|physical process]]es, e.g. [[hydrolysis]].  All non-living components of an ecosystem, such as atmospheric conditions and water resources, are called abiotic components.&lt;ref&gt;Water Quality Vocabulary. ISO 6107-6:1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
In biology, abiotic factors can include water, light, radiation, temperature, [[humidity]], [[atmosphere]], and soil. The macroscopic climate often influences each of the above. Pressure and sound waves may also be considered in the context of marine or sub-terrestrial environments.&lt;ref name=EoEarth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 |title=Abiotic factor |publisher=National Council for Science and the Environment |year=2010 |last=Hogan |first=C.

Consider the differences in the mechanics of [[C3 carbon fixation|C3]], [[C4 carbon fixation|C4]], and [[Crassulacean acid metabolism|CAM]] plants in regulating the influx of [[carbon dioxide]] to the [[Calvin-Benson Cycle]] in relation to their abiotic stressors. C3 plants have no mechanisms to manage [[photorespiration]], whereas C4 and CAM plants utilize a separate [[PEP Carboxylase]] enzyme to prevent photorespiration, thus increasing the yield of photosynthetic processes in certain high energy environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Chuali|last2=Guo|first2=Longyun|last3=Li|first3=Yixue|last4=Wang|first4=Zhuo|title=Systematic Comparison of C3 and C4 Plants Based on Metabolic Network Analysis|journal=BMC Systems Biology|date=2012|volume=6|issue=59|doi=10.1186/1752-0509-6-S2-S9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rubisco and C4 Plants|url=http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/content/filerepository/CMP/00/001/066/Rubisco%20and%20C4%20plants.pdf?v=1353967268963|website=RSC: Advancing the Chemical Sciences|publisher=RSC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Archea]] require very high temperatures, pressures or unusual concentrations of chemical substances such as sulfur; this is due to their specialization into extreme conditions. In addition, fungi have also evolved to survive at the temperature, the humidity, and stability of their environment.&lt;ref name=UWC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botany.uwc.ac.za/sci_ed/grade10/ecology/abiotic/abiot.htm |title=Abiotic Components |publisher=Department of Biodiversity and Conservation Biology, [[University of the Western Cape]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050425160041/http://www.botany.uwc.ac.za/SCI_ED/grade10/ecology/abiotic/abiot.htm |archivedate=2005-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, there is a significant difference in access in both water and humidity between [[temperate rain forest]]s and [[desert]]s. This difference in water availability causes a diversity in the types of plants and animals that survive in these areas. These differences in abiotic components alter the species present both by creating boundaries of what species can survive within the environment, as well as influencing competition between two species. Abiotic factors such as salinity can give one species a competitive advantage over another, creating pressures that lead to speciation and alteration of a species to and from generalist and specialist competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunson|first=William A.|date=November 1991|title=The Role of Abiotic Factors in Community Organization|url=https://www.jstor.org.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/stable/pdf/2462508.pdf|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=138 |issue=5|pages=1067–1091|doi=10.1086/285270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Nepal}}
The '''administrative divisions of Nepal''' ([[Nepali language|Nepali]]: नेपालको प्रशासनिक विभाजन ''Nēpālakō praśāsanika vibhājana'') are subnational administrative units of Nepal. The first level of [[country subdivision]]s of Nepal are the [[Provinces of Nepal|Provinces]]. Each province is further subdivided into [[Districts of Nepal|districts]], and each district into [[List of cities in Nepal|municipalities]] and [[List of gaupalikas of Nepal|rural municipalities]]. Before 2015, instead of provinces, Nepal was divided into [[Development regions of Nepal|developmental regions]] and [[List of zones of Nepal|administrative zones]].

Fulfilling the requirement of the new constitution of Nepal in 2015, all old municipalities and villages (which were more than 3900 in number) were restructured into 753 new Municipalities and Villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/new-local-level-structure-comes-effect-today/ |title= New local level structure comes into effect from today |date=10 March 2017 |website=www.thehimalayantimes.com |publisher=[[The Himalayan Times]] |access-date=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-08-11/govt-prepares-to-add-9-more-local-levels-in-province-2.html |title= Govt prepares to add 9 more local levels in Province 2 |date=11 August 2017 |website=www.kathmandupost.ekantipur.com |publisher= [[Kantipur Publication]] |access-date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former 75 district development committees (DDC) were also replaced by 77 new District Coordination Committees (DCC) which have much less power than the DDCs. At present there are 6 Metropolitan Cities, 11 Sub-Metropolitan Cities, 276 Municipalities, and 460 Rural Municipalities.

== Municipalities ==

=== Urban Municipalities ===
{{further|List of cities in Nepal}}
Municipalities are places having at least some minimum criteria of population and infrastructure and declared as a municipality by the government. There are 293 municipalities in Nepal. 

Urban municipalities are categorized into 3 levels:
*Metropolitan city (Mahanagarpalika)
*Sub metropolitan city (Upmahanagarpalika)
*Municipality (Nagarpalika)

There are six metropolitan cities: The capital city [[Kathmandu]], as well as [[Bharatpur, Nepal|Bharatpur]], [[Biratnagar]], [[Pokhara]], [[Patan, Lalitpur|Lalitpur]] and [[Birganj|Birgunj]]. There are 11 Sub-metropolitan Cities and 276 Municipalities.
{{Largest cities of Nepal}}

=== Rural Municipalities ===
{{further|Gaunpalika}}
Rural municipalities (gaunpalikas) were established in 2017, replacing the village development committees. The main purpose of a gaunpalika resembles that of a village development committee, but it has more rights on collection of royalty and taxes and has a higher annual budget than the VDC. Several VDCs were usually combined into each new gaupalika. There are 460 gaunpalikas in Nepal.

==Former developmental regions and zones==
{{Main|Former administrative units of Nepal|Development regions of Nepal|List of zones of Nepal|Village development committee (Nepal)}}
Prior to 10 September 2015, Nepal was divided into five developmental regions and fourteen administrative zones. At the time of the 2001 census, it was further subdivided into seventy-five districts.  Districts were divided into [[Village development committee (Nepal)|village development committees (VDC)]] and municipalities.  In the 2001 census, there were 3,915 VDCs and fifty-eight municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite map|title=Administrative Divisions |year=2001 |location=Kathmandu |publisher=Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Nepal |url=http://cbs.gov.np/image/data/Gis_Maps/General/Administrative%20Divisions.gif |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180902222224/http://cbs.gov.np/image/data/Gis_Maps/General/Administrative%20Divisions.gif |archive-date=2 September 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ary-Mas''' ({{lang-ru|Ары-Мас}}) is a forest in [[Russia]], [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]], southern part of [[Taymyr Peninsula]], southern bank of [[Novaya River]]. Ary-Mas comes from the [[Dolgan language]] and means "forest island".

Considered to be the northernmost [[forest]] of the world although [[Lukunsky grove]] to the east from it extends 6 kilometres further north. Though, while Lukunsky grove is northernmost rim of larger forest massif, Ary-Mas is a forest island separated from the nearest forest by approximately 200 kilometres wide zone of [[tundra]].

==Climate==
Vegetation period is approximately 100 days long. Winter here lasts from late September to early October to June, minimum temperatures often fall below -35 – -45 °C, wind speed in winter often exceeds 50&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taimyrsky.ru/index.htm State Nature Biosphere Reserve "Taymyrsky", accessed on 6 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Polar day lasts from the late June to early August, median temperature in July is 12 °C, often up to 30 °C.

[[Permafrost]] in summer thaws 0.3 – 2 metres deep. Thickness of permafrost here is approximately 200 metres.

==Biodiversity==
The only tree-form species of Ary-Mas is [[Dahurian larch]] (''Larix gmelinii'' (Rupr.) Rupr.)), but in total in Ary-Mas there have been found 306 species of plants, 90 species of birds, 20 species of mammals.

Dahurian larch grows sparsely, separate trees grow up to 5 – 7 metres tall.

==Conservation and scientific investigations==
Ary-Mas is a protected territory with area 156,11 km2. It forms a part of [[Taymyr Nature Reserve|Taymyr State Nature Biosphere Reserve]] and is protected since 1979.

Constant investigations of Dahurian larch started in 1969 and have continued since then. Current scientific studies are led by the Taymyr State Nature Biosphere Reserve and major part of results are compiled in yearly nature reports.

'''Barr Creek Falls''', is a [[waterfall]] located in the Rogue River Canyon within the [[Prospect State Scenic Viewpoint]] in [[Jackson County, Oregon|Jackson County]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]]. The waterfall is located at the south end of Barr Creek as it plunges into the Rogue River over a carved cliff surrounded by walls of petrified volcanic ash as a consequence of the [[Mount Mazama]] eruption. The waterfall has also been called Bear Creek Falls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Plumb|first= Gregory |date= 2013|title= Waterfall Lover's Guide Pacific Northwest: Where to Find Hundreds of Spectacular Waterfalls in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uUQUCgAAQBAJ|location= |publisher= Mountaineers Books|page= |isbn= 1594857547|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The waterfall gets its name from the creek which was called "Barr" for the presence of a fence that prevented cattle from straying out of the local Red Blanket Ranch and that ran adjacent to the creek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lewis |first= McArthur|date= 2003|title= Oregon Geographic Names, Volume 1|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TK0RAQAAIAAJ|location= |publisher= Oregon Historical Society Press|page= 55|isbn= 0875952771|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Barr Creek Falls shares the same rock cliff with [[Mill Creek Falls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Barr Creek Falls | publisher = Northwest Waterfall Survey | year = 2008 | url = http://www.waterfallsnorthwest.com/nws/waterfall.php?st=&amp;num=1517 | accessdate = 2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both waterfalls can be seen next to each other from their respective viewpoints. 

The fall drops in three major steps. First plummets 60-feet, which is not a visible section of the cascade from the trail viewpoint. The second tier drops down another 30 feet, which is half visible from the viewpoint during high water flow. Finally it plummets 150 feet to the canyon floor before meeting with the Rogue River. With a height of 240 feet, Barr Creek Falls is among the tallest waterfalls in Oregon.

== Location ==
Barr Creek Falls is located at the southernmost tip of the Prospect State Scenic Viewpoint. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) places the falls at coordinates {{coord|42.7462386|-122.4955911}} at an elevation of {{convert|2529|ft|m}} above sea level.&lt;ref name="falls"&gt;{{cite web | work = [[Geographic Names Information System]] (GNIS)| publisher = [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) | date = 1993-04-01 | url = https://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=138:3:0::NO::P3_FID,P3_TITLE:1157109,Barr%20Creek%20Falls | title = Barr Creek Falls| accessdate = 2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barr Creek runs from the Western skirt of [[Crater Lake]], bisects the southern end of the Prospect Airfield and plummets down the Rogue River Canyon a few yards before intersecting the Rogue River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.waterfallsnorthwest.com/waterfall/Barr-Creek-Falls-4141 |title=Barr Creek Falls - Jackson County, Oregon|publisher=WaterfallsNorthwest.com |date= |accessdate=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access ==
Access to the waterfall is from a trail that starts on the park's parking lot on the town of Prospect's Mill Creek Drive, the southernmost of two parking lots on the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Richmond|first= Simon |date= 2018|title= Lonely Planet USA's Best Trips|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esBNDwAAQBAJ |location= |publisher= [[Lonely Planet]]|page= |isbn= 178701939X|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trail-head has an illustrative map of the area including the trail to the Avenue of Boulders and Barr Creek Falls.

'''Bedout''' {{IPAc-en|b|ᵻ|ˈ|d|uː}}, or more specifically the '''Bedout High''', is a [[geological]] and [[geophysical]] feature centered about 250&amp;nbsp;km off the northwestern coast of [[Australia]] in the [[Canning Basin|Canning]] and overlying [[Roebuck Basin|Roebuck]] basins. Although not obvious from sea floor topography, it is a roughly circular area about 30&amp;nbsp;km in diameter where older rocks have been uplifted as much as 4&amp;nbsp;km towards the surface.&lt;ref name="Gorter1996"&gt;Gorter J.D. 1996. Speculation on the origin of the Bedout high - a large, circular structure of pre-Mesozoic age in the offshore Canning Basin, Western Australia. PESA News, October/November 1996, p. 32-34.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bedout High was penetrated by two petroleum exploration wells (Bedout-1, Lagrange-1) in the 1970s and 1980s.  It is named after nearby [[Bedout Island]].

== Impact hypothesis ==
In 1996 Australian [[geologist]] John Gorter first suggested that the Bedout High might mark the centre of a very large buried [[impact crater]] up to 250&amp;nbsp;km in diameter, based mainly on its internal geological structure as revealed on a single [[Reflection seismology|seismic]] survey line, and suggested that it may be of near end [[Permian]] age, based on the reported age of volcanic rocks in Lagrange-1.&lt;ref name="Gorter1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gorter1998"&gt;Gorter J.D. 1998. The petroleum potential of Australian Phanerozoic impact structures. The APPEA Journal 38, 159-187.&lt;/ref&gt; The impact hypothesis was developed further by Luanne Becker ([[University of California]]) and coworkers who claimed to have confirmed that the supposed volcanic rocks in the petroleum wells are actually impact melt [[breccia]] showing evidence of [[shock metamorphism]], and re-dated these rocks at 250.1 ± 4.5 [[Annum|Ma]].&lt;ref name="Becker2004"&gt;Becker L., Poreda R.J., Basu A.R., Pope K.O., Harrison T.M., Nicholson C. &amp; Iasky R. 2004. Bedout: A possible end-Permian impact crater offshore of northwestern Australia. Science 304, 1469-1476. [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1093925 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; The new age is essentially coincident with the [[Permian]]-[[Triassic]] boundary and associated [[Permian-Triassic extinction event|extinction event]], and Becker speculates that there is a likely connection. It was subsequently reported, based on very limited preliminary data, that the impact hypothesis is further supported by [[chromium]] [[isotope]] evidence for the presence of extraterrestrial material.&lt;ref name="Becker2006"&gt;Becker L., Shukolyukov A., Macassic C., Lugmair G. &amp; Poreda R. 2006. Extraterrestrial Chromium at the Graphite Peak P/Tr boundary and in the Bedout Impact Melt Breccia. Lunar and Planetary Science XXXVII (2006), abstract # 2321.[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2006/pdf/2321.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rebuttals to the impact hypothesis ==
The Bedout impact hypothesis has not been widely supported by impact cratering specialists. Specific counter claims include:
# The alleged impact melt breccia actually has the characteristics of a volcanic [[basalt]], in part altered by contact with sea water and [[metamorphism]] due to its deep burial, and the evidence for shock metamorphism is likely mistaken.&lt;ref name="Glikson2004a"&gt;Glikson A. 2004.

'''Browns Mountain''', also sometimes spelt '''Brown's Mountain''', is a small submarine mountain – a [[seamount]] – lying in the south-western [[Pacific Ocean]] 38&amp;nbsp;km off the coast of [[New South Wales]], Australia, about 50&amp;nbsp;km east of the city of [[Sydney]]. The waters around the seamount are about 600&amp;nbsp;m in depth, while the mountain itself rises some 133&amp;nbsp;m above the sea floor. It is a popular site for commercial and recreational fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.downriggershop.com.au/FMag/Deepwater_fishing.pdf |title=Deepwater Fishing Brown’s Mountain |accessdate=2013-12-13 |work=The Boat Mag |first=Andrew |last=Hestelow |publisher=Downrigger Shop |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421025132/http://www.downriggershop.com.au/FMag/Deepwater_fishing.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bonzle.com/c/a?a=p&amp;p=280153&amp;cmd=sp|title=Map of Browns Mountain, NSW |accessdate=2013-12-13 |work= |first= |last= |publisher=Bonzle.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It got its name from Ernie Brown, the popular local Sydney fisherman who discovered it.

The '''Colonial Secretary of Van Diemen's Land''' (later '''Colonial Secretary of Tasmania''') was the representative of the [[Great Britain|British]] [[Colonial Office]] in [[Van Diemen's Land]] (later [[Tasmania]]), and was usually appointed from Britain.
In 1884, the role was renamed Chief Secretary.

{{Politics of Romania}}

The '''development regions of Romania''' (Romanian ''Regiunile de dezvoltare ale României'') refer to the eight regional divisions created in [[Romania]] in 1998 in order to better co-ordinate regional development as Romania progressed towards accession to the [[European Union]]. The development regions correspond to [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS II]]-level divisions in European Union member states. Despite becoming increasingly significant in regional development projects, Romania's development regions do not actually have an administrative status and do not have a legislative or executive council or government. Rather, they serve a function for allocating European Union [[PHARE]] funds for regional development, as well as for collection of regional statistics. They also co-ordinate a range of regional development projects and became members of the [[Committee of the Regions]] when Romania joined the EU on January 1, 2007.

==List==
There are 8 development regions in Romania, which (with the exception of București-Ilfov) are named by their geographical position in the country:
*RO1 – [[Macroregiune]]a 1:
**[[Nord-Vest (development region)|Nord-Vest]] – RO11; 6 counties; 2,600,132 inhabitants; {{convert|34159|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}
**[[Centru (development region)|Centru]] – RO12; 6 counties; 2,360,805 inhabitants; {{convert|34082|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}
*RO2 – Macroregiunea 2:
**[[Nord-Est (development region)|Nord-Est]] – RO21; 6 counties; 3,302,217 inhabitants; {{convert|36850|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}
**[[Sud-Est (development region)|Sud-Est]] – RO22; 6 counties; 2,545,923 inhabitants; {{convert|35762|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}
*RO3 – Macroregiunea 3:
**[[Sud (development region)|Sud - Muntenia]] – RO31; 7 counties; 3,136,446 inhabitants; {{convert|34489|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}
**[[București-Ilfov (development region)|București - Ilfov]] – RO32; 1 county and Bucharest; 2,272,163 inhabitants; {{convert|1811|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}
*RO4 – Macroregiunea 4:
**[[Sud-Vest (development region)|Sud-Vest Oltenia]] – RO41; 5 counties; 2,075,642 inhabitants; {{convert|29212|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}
**[[Vest (development region)|Vest]] – RO42; 4 counties; 1,828,313 inhabitants; {{convert|32028|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}

An '''enclave''' is a territory, or a part of a territory, that is entirely surrounded by the territory of one other state.&lt;ref name="Raton"&gt;{{cite web |last=Raton |first=Pierre |title=Les enclaves |work= Annuaire français de droit international |year=1958 |volume= 4 |page= 186 |url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/afdi_0066-3085_1958_num_4_1_1373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Territorial waters have the same sovereign attributes as land, and enclaves may therefore exist within territorial waters.&lt;ref name="Melamid"/&gt;{{rp|60}}

An '''exclave''' is a portion of a state or territory geographically separated from the main part by surrounding alien territory (of one or more states).&lt;ref name=Websters_p497&gt;{{cite dictionary |article=Exclave |title=Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language |year=1989 |page=497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many exclaves are also enclaves. ''Enclave'' is sometimes used improperly to denote a territory that is only partly surrounded by another state.&lt;ref name="Raton"/&gt; [[Vatican City]] and [[San Marino]], enclaved by [[Italy]], and [[Lesotho]], enclaved by [[South Africa]], are the only completely enclaved states. Unlike an enclave, an exclave can be surrounded by several states.&lt;ref name="YRY"/&gt; The [[Azerbaijan]]i exclave of [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] is an example of an exclave.

'''Semi-enclaves''' and '''semi-exclaves''' are areas that, except for possessing an unsurrounded sea border (a coastline contiguous with international waters), would otherwise be enclaves or exclaves.&lt;ref name="YRY"/&gt;{{rp|116}}&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;{{rp|12–14}} Enclaves and semi-enclaves can exist as independent states ([[Monaco]], [[Gambia]] and [[Brunei]] are semi-enclaves), while exclaves always constitute just a part of a sovereign state (like the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]]).&lt;ref name="YRY"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The concepts of enclave and exclave and their use in the political and geographical characteristic of the Kaliningrad region |journal=Baltic Region |year=2013 |first=Yuri |last= Rozhkov-Yuryevsky |doi= 10.5922/2079-8555-2013-2-11 |number= 2 |pages=113–123 |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.5922/2079-8555-2013-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pene-enclave''' is a part of the territory of one country that can be conveniently approached—in particular, by wheeled traffic—only through the territory of another country.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robinson |first=G.

A pene-enclave can also exist entirely on land, such as when intervening mountains render a territory inaccessible from other parts of a country except through alien territory. A commonly cited example is the [[Kleinwalsertal]], a valley part of [[Vorarlberg]], Austria, that is accessible only from Germany to the north.

==Origin and usage==
The word ''enclave'' is French and first appeared in the mid-15th century as a derivative of the verb ''enclaver'' (1283), from the colloquial Latin ''inclavare'' (to close with a key).&lt;ref name="LGR"&gt;Le Grand Robert, ''Dictionnaire de la Langue Française'', 2001, vol.&amp;nbsp;III, p.&amp;nbsp;946.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, it was a term of property law that denoted the situation of a land or parcel of land surrounded by land owned by a different owner, and that could not be reached for its exploitation in a practical and sufficient manner without crossing the surrounding land.&lt;ref name="LGR"/&gt; In law, this created a ''servitude''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |quote=Servitude: '''Law'''. ''A right possessed by one person with respect to another's property, consisting either of a right to use the other's property, or a power to prevent certain uses of it''. |title=Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language |year=1989 |page=1304}}&lt;/ref&gt; of passage for the benefit of the owner of the surrounded land. The first diplomatic document to contain the word ''enclave'' was the [[Treaty of Madrid (1526)|Treaty of Madrid]], signed in 1526.&lt;ref name="Melamid"&gt;{{cite news |first=Alexander |last=Melamid |title=Enclaves and Exclaves |work=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences |volume=5 |year=1968 |editor-first=David |editor-last=Sills |publisher=The Macmillan Company &amp; Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}}

Later, the term enclave began to be used also to refer to parcels of countries, counties, fiefs, communes, towns, parishes, etc. that were surrounded by alien territory. This French word eventually entered the English and other languages to denote the same concept, although local terms have continued to be used. In India, the word "pocket" is often used as a synonym for enclave (such as "the pockets of Puducherry district").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jobresultsnic.in/2014/12/bsnl-recruitment-2014-2015-apply-for.html |title=Government Jobs in BSNL : 01 Jobs Opening |publisher=jobresultsnic.in |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224165814/http://www.jobresultsnic.in/2014/12/bsnl-recruitment-2014-2015-apply-for.html |archivedate=2014-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In British administrative history, subnational enclaves were usually called '''detachments''' or '''detached parts''', and national enclaves as '''detached districts''' or '''detached dominions'''.&lt;ref&gt;As can be seen on 18th. century maps of Germany and other European countries by British cartographers and publishers such as R. Wilkinson.&lt;/ref&gt; In English [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastic]] history, subnational enclaves were known as '''peculiars''' (see also [[Royal Peculiar]]).

The word ''exclave'', modeled on enclave,&lt;ref name=Websters_p497/&gt; is a [[Extension (semantics)|logically extended]] [[back-formation]] of ''enclave''.

Enclaves exist for a variety of [[historical]], [[political]] and [[geographical]] reasons. For example, in the [[feudal system]] in Europe, the ownership of feudal domains was often transferred or partitioned, either through purchase and sale or through inheritance, and often such domains were or came to be surrounded by other domains. In particular, this state of affairs persisted into the 19th century in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and these domains (principalities, etc.) exhibited many of the characteristics of sovereign states. Prior to 1866 Prussia alone consisted of more than 270 discontiguous pieces of territory.&lt;ref name="Melamid"/&gt;{{rp|61}}

Residing in an enclave within another country has often involved difficulties in such areas as passage rights, importing goods, currency, provision of utilities and health services, and host nation cooperation. Thus, over time, enclaves have tended to be eliminated. For example, two-thirds of the then-existing national-level enclaves were extinguished on August 1, 2015, when the governments of [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]] implemented a Land Boundary Agreement that exchanged 162 first-order enclaves (111 Indian and 51 Bangladeshi). This exchange thus effectively de-enclaved another two dozen second-order enclaves and one third-order enclave, eliminating 197 of the [[Indo-Bangladesh enclaves]] in all. The residents in these enclaves had complained of being effectively stateless. Only Bangladesh's Dahagram–Angarpota enclave remained.

===Enclave versus exclave===
For illustration, in the figure (above), A1 is a '''semi-enclave''' (attached to C and also bounded by water that only touches C's territorial water). Although A2 is an exclave of A, it cannot be classed as an enclave because it shares borders with B and C. The territory A3 is both an exclave of A and an enclave from the viewpoint of B. The singular territory D, although an enclave, is not an exclave.

==True enclaves==
{{Further information|List of enclaves and exclaves}}

An enclave is a part of the territory of a state that is enclosed within the territory of another state. To distinguish the parts of a state entirely enclosed in a single other state, they are called '''true enclaves'''.&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;{{rp|10}} A true enclave cannot be reached without passing through the territory of a single other state that surrounds it. ''Vinokurov (2007)'' calls this the restrictive definition of "enclave" given by international law, which thus "comprises only so-called 'true enclaves'".&lt;ref name="EV"&gt;{{cite book |first=Evgeny |last=Vinokurov |title = The Theory of Enclaves |year = 2007 |publisher = Lexington Books, Lanham, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} Two examples are [[Büsingen am Hochrhein]], a true enclave of Germany, and [[Campione d'Italia]], a true enclave of Italy, both of which are surrounded by Switzerland.

The definition of a territory comprises both land territory and territorial waters. In the case of enclaves in territorial waters, they are called maritime (those surrounded by territorial sea) or lacustrine (if in a lake) enclaves.&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;{{rp|10}} Most of the true national-level enclaves now existing are in Asia and Europe. While subnational enclaves are numerous the world over, there are only a few national-level true enclaves in Africa, Australia and the Americas (each such enclave being surrounded by the territorial waters of another country).

An historical example is [[West Berlin]] before the reunification of [[Germany]]. Since 1945, all of Berlin was ruled ''de jure'' by the four Allied powers. However, the East German government and the [[Soviet Union]] treated East Berlin as an integral part of East Germany, so West Berlin was a ''de facto'' enclave within [[East Germany]]. Also, 12 small West Berlin enclaves, such as [[Steinstücken]], were separated from the city, some by only a few meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berlin.enclaves.org/ |title=Berlin Exclaves |accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enclaved countries===
[[File:LocationLesotho.png|frame|Position of [[Lesotho]] within [[South Africa]]]]
{{see also|List of countries that border only one other country}}
Three nations qualify, as completely surrounded by another country's land and/or internal waters:  
* The Republic of [[San Marino]], enclaved within [[Italy]]
* [[Vatican City]], enclaved within the city of [[Rome]], Italy
* The Kingdom of [[Lesotho]], enclaved within [[South Africa]]

Historically, four [[Bantustans]] (or "Black homelands") of South Africa were granted nominal independence, unrecognized internationally, by the [[Apartheid]]ist government from 1976 until their reabsorption in 1994. Others remained under government rule from 1948 to 1994. Being heavily partitioned, various parts of these Bantustans were true enclaves.

The United States' constitutional principle of [[tribal sovereignty]] treats federally-recognized [[Indian reservation]]s as quasi-independent enclaves.

===Temporary enclaves===
To establish jurisdiction, the [[Scottish Court in the Netherlands]], at Camp Zeist near [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], was temporarily declared as sovereign territory of the [[United Kingdom]] under [[Scots law]] for the duration of the trial of those accused in the [[Lockerbie bombing]], and was therefore an exclave of the United Kingdom and of [[Scotland]], and an enclave within the Netherlands. This was also so during the appeal against the conviction. The court was first convened in 1999, and the land returned to the Netherlands in 2002.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/1870685.stm |agency=[[BBC News]] |date=2002-03-14 |accessdate=2011-01-30 |title=Uncertain future for Camp Zeist |quote=The former military base at Camp Zeist in Holland has been under Scottish jurisdiction for more than three years.

==True exclaves==
[[File:Nakhichevan03.png|thumb|[[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]]]]
''True exclave'' is an extension of the concept of ''true enclave''. In order to access a true exclave from the mainland, a traveller must go through the territory of at least one other state. Examples include:
* [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]], which borders [[Turkey]], [[Armenia]] and [[Iran]], is an exclave of [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ataa.org/reference/occupation_az.html |title=Assembly of Turkish American Associations |publisher=Ataa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[United Arab Emirates]], four emirates have five true exclaves: [[Emirate of Dubai|Dubai]] ([[Hatta, United Arab Emirates|Hatta]]), [[Emirate of Ajman|Ajmān]] ([[Masfut|Masfout]] and [[Manama, Ajman|Manama]]), [[Ras al-Khaimah]] (the southerly of the emirate's two non-contiguous sections), and [[Emirate of Sharjah|Sharjah]] ([[Nahwa]], also both a true national-level enclave and a counter-enclave).
* [[Llívia]] is an enclave and exclave of [[Spain]] surrounded by [[France]].
* [[Campione d'Italia]] is an enclave and exclave of [[Italy]] surrounded by [[Switzerland]].
* [[Büsingen am Hochrhein]] is an enclave and exclave of [[Germany]] surrounded by Switzerland. The shortest distance from Büsingen's borders to the main portion of German territory is only about 700 metres (about 2,300&amp;nbsp;ft).
* [[Likoma Island|Likoma]] and [[Chizumulu Island]]s in [[Lake Malawi]] are lacustrine enclaves and exclaves of [[Malawi]], surrounded by [[Mozambique]] territorial waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.malawitourism.com/pages/attractions/the_attraction.asp?AttractionsID=8 |title= Malawi Tourism Guide |publisher=MalawiTMC |accessdate=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related constructs and terms==

=== Semi-enclaves/exclaves===
'''Semi-enclaves''' and '''semi-exclaves''' are areas that, except for possessing an unsurrounded sea border, would otherwise be enclaves or exclaves.&lt;ref name="YRY"/&gt;{{rp|116}}&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;{{rp|12–14}} Semi-enclaves can exist as independent states that border only one other state, such as [[Monaco]], [[the Gambia]] and [[Brunei]].  ''Vinokurov (2007)'' declares, "Technically, [[Portugal]], [[Denmark]], and [[Canada]] also border only one foreign state, but they are not enclosed in the geographical, political, or economic sense. They have vast access to international waters. At the same time, there are states that, although in possession of sea access, are still enclosed by the territories of a foreign state."&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;{{rp|14}} Therefore, a quantitative principle applies: ''the land boundary must be longer than the coastline.'' Thus a state is classified as a ''sovereign semi-enclave'' if it borders on just one state, and its land boundary is longer than its sea coastline.&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;{{rp|14, 20–22}}

Vinokurov affirms that "no similar quantitative criterion is needed to define the scope of non-sovereign semi-enclaves/exclaves."&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;{{rp|14, 26}}&lt;ref&gt;''Vinokurov (2007)'', p. 29, also refers to semi-exclaves as a type of "mere exclave with sea connection to the mainland."&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include:

* [[Alaska]], one of the states in the [[United States|United States of America]], is the largest semi-exclave in the world, separated from the US by Canada.  
* [[Oecusse]], a district on the northwestern side of the island of Timor, is a semi-enclave of [[East Timor]].
* [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] are Spanish semi-enclaves on the Mediterranean coast of [[Morocco]].
* [[Temburong]] is a Bruneian semi-enclave surrounded by [[Malaysia]].
* [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] is a federal subject of [[Russia]] (an oblast), a semi-exclave situated on the Baltic coast. Sea access from mainland is possible from [[Saint Petersburg]] via [[Gulf of Finland]] without passing through other states' territory.
* [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] (also spelled '''Kabinda''', formerly '''Portuguese Congo''') is a semi-exclave and a [[Provinces of Angola|province]] of [[Angola]] on the Atlantic coast of southwestern [[Africa]], separated by the only sea-access port of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. 
* [[French Guiana]] (a [[French overseas department|French Overseas Department]]), in [[South America]], is a semi-exclave that is bounded by [[Suriname]], [[Brazil]], and the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

===Subnational enclaves and exclaves===
Sometimes, administrative divisions of a country, for historical or practical reasons, caused some areas to belong to one division while being attached to another.
* [[Dadra DNH|Dadra]], enclaved within the state of [[Gujarat]], is part of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]] in [[India]].
* [[Pondicherry district]], of the Union Territory of [[Puducherry]], is made of 12 non-contiguous parts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://police.pondicherry.gov.in/Map%20all%20region%20ok/Puducherry%20Map%2025.05.11.htm| title = Map showing the existing police station limits|accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of them true enclaves entirely surrounded by the state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. Before Pondicherry, along with the other territories of [[French India]], was absorbed into India in 1954, they were enclaved within the Union of India, and before that the [[British Raj]]. Also a legacy of the French colonial period, the [[Mahe district]] is made of three non-contiguous parts enclaved within the state of [[Kerala]].
* From 1947 to 1971, [[Bangladesh]] was a part of [[Pakistan]] as its [[East Pakistan]] exclave, separated from [[West Pakistan]] by 1,760 kilometers (1,100 miles) of [[India]]. It eventually gained independence in 1971, during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].
* Before 1974, and especially before 1844, there were many [[List of county exclaves in England and Wales 1844–1974|exclaves of counties in England and Wales]].
* The [[Counties of scotland#Counties until 1890|counties of Scotland]] before reorganisation in 1889 included dozens of exclaves. This was especially notable in the case of [[Cromartyshire]], which was split into at least nine parts spread across [[Ross-shire]].
* The [[France|French]] [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Pyrénées-Atlantiques]], in the southwest of France, surrounds two enclaves of the neighbouring department of [[Hautes-Pyrénées]].
* The French department of [[Vaucluse]] has a rather large exclave to its southeast within the [[Drôme]] department – the [[Canton in France|canton]] of [[Valréas]] (historically known as [[Enclave des Papes]]).
* [[San Colombano al Lambro]] is an exclave of the province of [[Milan]] at the junction between the [[Pavia]] and [[Lodi Province|Lodi]] provinces. The exclave arose when the province of Lodi was carved out of the province of Milan, but a [[referendum]] in San Colombano indicated the locals' wish to stay in Milan. As a result, the commune is the only wine-producing area in the mostly urbanized province of Milan.

The term '''[[Wiktionary:pene-|pene]]-exclave''' was defined in ''Robinson (1959)'' as "parts of the territory of one country that can be approached conveniently – in particular by wheeled traffic – only through the territory of another country."&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;{{rp|283}} Thus, a ''pene-exclave'', although having land borders, is not completely surrounded by the other's land or territorial waters.&lt;ref&gt;''Melamid (1968)'' states, "Contiguous territories of states which for all regular commercial and administrative purposes can be reached only through the territory of other states are called pene-enclaves (pene-exclaves). These have virtually the same characteristics as complete enclaves (exclaves)."&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60}} ''Catudal (1974)''&lt;ref name="HMC"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Honoré M. |last=Catudal |title=Exclaves|journal= Cahiers de géographie du Québec |volume=18 |number=43 |year= 1974 |pages=107–136 |url= http://id.erudit.org/iderudit/021178ar |doi=10.7202/021178ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|113}} and ''Vinokurov (2007)''&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;{{rp|31–33}} further elaborate upon examples, including [[Point Roberts]]. "Although physical connections by water with Point Roberts are entirely within the sovereignty of the United States, land access is only possible through Canada."&lt;ref name="HMC"/&gt;

Pene-enclaves are also called functional enclaves or practical enclaves.&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;{{rp|31}} They can exhibit continuity of state territory across territorial waters but, nevertheless, a discontinuity on land, such as in the case of Point Roberts.&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;{{rp|47}} Along rivers that change course, pene-enclaves can be observed as complexes comprising many small pene-enclaves.&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;{{rp|50}} A pene-enclave can also exist entirely on land, such as when intervening mountains render a territory, although geographically attached, inaccessible from other parts of a country except through alien territory. A commonly cited example is the [[Kleinwalsertal]], a valley part of [[Vorarlberg]], Austria, that is only accessible from Germany to the north, being separated from the rest of Austria by high mountains traversed by no roads. Another example is the Spanish village of [[Os de Civís]], accessible from Andorra.

Hence, such areas are enclaves or exclaves ''for practical purposes'', without meeting the strict definition.  Many pene-exclaves partially border the sea or another body of water, which comprises their own territorial waters (i.e., they are not surrounded by other nations' territorial waters). They border their own territorial waters in addition to a land border with another country, and hence they are not true exclaves. Still, one cannot travel to them on land without going through another country. Attribution of a pene-enclave status to a territory can sometimes be disputed, depending on whether the territory is considered to be practically inaccessible from the mainland or not.&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;{{rp|33}}

* [[Northern Ireland]], an area of the [[United Kingdom]], is bounded by the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[Irish Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]].
* [[Equatorial Guinea]]'s continental portion, [[Rio Muni]], is a semi-exclave surrounded by [[Gabon]], [[Cameroon]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]].
* The [[Northwest Angle]] in Minnesota is geographically separated from the rest of the state (and United States) by [[Lake of the Woods]] and is only accessible on land through [[Canada]], via [[Manitoba]].
* [[Point Roberts]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], is an unincorporated community in [[Whatcom County]]—located on the southernmost tip of the Tsawwassen Peninsula, south of Delta, British Columbia, Canada—that can be reached by land from the rest of the United States only by traveling through Canada.
* [[Vermont]] has two pene-enclaves with Canada. Province Point, a few kilometres to the northeast of the town of [[East Alburgh, Vermont]], is the southernmost tip of a small promontory approximately 2 acres (1 ha) in size ({{coord|45|0|48.07|N|73|11|35.72|W}}). The promontory is cut through by the US-Canada border; as such the area is a practical enclave of the United States contiguous with Canada. Similarly, the southern point of [[Province Island]] ({{coord|45|0|15|N|72|13|52|W}}), a small island mostly in the Canadian province of Quebec, crosses into the American state of Vermont. It is situated in [[Lake Memphremagog]], near [[Newport, Vermont]].
* [[Walvis Bay]], now part of [[Namibia]], was a pene-exclave of the [[Cape Colony]] in [[German South-West Africa]], created in 1878. It became part of the [[Cape Province]] of the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910, but from 1922, it was administered as a ''de facto'' part of [[South-West Africa]], a [[League of Nations]] [[League of Nations Mandate|Mandate]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h1GU1KXstegC&amp;lpg=PA214&amp;ots=l9xeWFz_oy&amp;dq=%22South%20West%20Africa%20Affairs%20Act%20%22%201922&amp;pg=PA213#v=onepage&amp;q=%22South%20West%20Africa%20Affairs%20Act%20%22%201922&amp;f=true Succession of States and Namibian territories], Y.

====Subnational "practical" enclaves, exclaves and inaccessible districts====
* Although the [[Jervis Bay Territory]], which occupies a coastal peninsula in Australia, is not part of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], the laws of the ACT apply to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jervis Bay Territory Governance and Administration |url= http://www.regional.gov.au/territories/jervis_bay/governanceadministration.aspx |work=Although the Jervis Bay Territory is not part of the Australian Capital Territory, the laws of the ACT apply, in so far as they are applicable and, providing they are not inconsistent with an Ordinance, in the Territory by virtue of the Jervis Bay Acceptance Act 1915. |publisher=The Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport |accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Romanian village of [[Nămoloasa]] ([[Galați county]]) can be accessed only through [[Vrancea County|Vrancea county]] (where there is a bridge over the [[Siret river]]), because it is separated by the [[Siret|Siret River]] from the rest of [[Galați county]].
* The southern part of the [[Province of Venice]], Veneto, can be reached directly from the rest of the province only by boat. By land it can be reached only traveling through the [[Province of Padua]] because territorial continuity with the main part of the province exists only through some unconnected islands and islets.
* It is not possible to drive from the northern half of [[County Leitrim]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]] to the southern half without leaving the county; [[Lough Allen]] and the [[River Shannon]] present a water barrier requiring one to drive through [[County Cavan]] to the east or [[County Roscommon]] to the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://maps.google.ie/maps?q=leitrim&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=54.19619,-8.002853&amp;spn=0.248649,0.676346&amp;sll=54.185343,-8.030663&amp;sspn=0.124357,0.338173&amp;hnear=Leitrim,+County+Leitrim&amp;t=m&amp;z=11 |title=Google Maps route out of the county from one point on the county border to the other here}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The community of [[East Kemptville, Nova Scotia]], Canada, is part of the [[Argyle, Nova Scotia|Municipality of Argyle]], but it can only be reached by road from the rest of the municipality by travelling through the [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia (municipal district)|Municipality of Yarmouth]] or the [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia (municipal district)|Municipality of Shelburne]]. The latter route also requires travelling through the [[Barrington, Nova Scotia|Municipality of Barrington]].
* In the United States:
** Several portions of land on the [[New Jersey]] side of the [[Delaware River]] belong to [[Delaware]]. Within the [[Twelve-Mile Circle]], Delaware's border extends to the low-water mark across the river. South of the Circle, the Delaware-New Jersey border follows the middle of the river and bay.
** The [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]] on the southern portion of the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] shares a border with [[Maryland]] but is only connected to the rest of [[Virginia]] by the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel]], which is part of [[U.S. Route 13]]. 
** The city of [[Carter Lake, Iowa]] is separated from the rest of the state of [[Iowa]] by the [[Missouri River]], which changed course during a flood in 1877, cutting the city off from the rest of the state. It is now only accessible through [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska]].
** The village of [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]], the state's first capital, is separated from the rest of Illinois by the [[Mississippi River]] due to a flood in 1881, which shifted the river to flow east of the town, rather than west. This resulted in the only access to the town being from [[Missouri]].
** The [[Upper Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]] is separated from the [[Lower Peninsula]] by the [[Straits of Mackinac]], so until construction of the [[Mackinac Bridge]], the only land routes between them were through the states of [[Wisconsin]], [[Illinois]], and [[Indiana]], or through the Canadian province of [[Ontario]],
** The [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]] is separated from the rest of the borough by the [[Harlem River]].

===Enclaves within enclaves===
[[File:Baarle-Nassau - Baarle-Hertog-en.svg|thumb|Map showing the non-contiguous [[Belgium|Belgian]] exclaves of [[Baarle-Hertog]] in the [[Netherlands]] which, in turn, has Dutch enclaves within it]]
[[File:Cooch-behar-enclaves-schematisch.png|thumb|[[Indo-Bangladesh enclaves]] created by the 1947 [[Partition of India]]]]
It is possible for an enclave of one country to be completely surrounded by a part of another country that is itself an enclave of the first country. These enclaves are sometimes called ''counter-enclaves''.
*The Dutch municipality of [[Baarle-Nassau]] has seven exclaves in two exclaves of the Belgian municipality of [[Baarle-Hertog]].
*The former complex of enclaves at [[Cooch Behar district]] included 24 second-order enclaves and one small '''third-order enclave''' called ''[[Dahala Khagrabari|Dahala Khagrabari #51]]'': a piece of India within Bangladesh, within India, within Bangladesh. The [[Indo-Bangladesh enclaves]] were exchanged on 31 July 2015 by the ratified Land Boundary Agreement, and Dahala Khagrabari was ceded to Bangladesh.
* [[Nahwa]] of the [[United Arab Emirates]] is surrounded by [[Madha]], an exclave of Oman within the U.A.E.
*The Portuguese town of [[Estremoz]] is made up of two civil parishes (''freguesias''): the small ''Santo André'' and the big ''Santa Maria''. Santo André corresponds to the old town (located inside the medieval walls), but excludes the citadel, which is an enclave inside the old town; the citadel belongs to Santa Maria, which also includes the entire new town (outside the walls) and the vast rural area around it. Thus, Santa Maria has an enclave (Santo André, the old town) with a second-order enclave inside it (the citadel).&lt;ref&gt;Instituto Geográfico do Exército: [http://www.igeoe.pt/igeoearcweb/igeoesig/ExecCmd.asp?cmd=SelArea&amp;distrito=%C9VORA&amp;concelho=ESTREMOZ&amp;freguesia=ESTREMOZ%20%28SANTA%20MARIA%29 Territory of Santa Maria (Estremoz)]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic enclaves===
An [[ethnic enclave]] is a community of an ethnic group inside an area in which another ethnic group predominates. [[Ghetto]]s, [[Little Italy]]s, [[barrio]]s and [[Chinatown]]s are examples. These areas may have a separate language, culture and economic system.
* [[Székely Land]] is a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] ethnic enclave within [[Romania]], with its people calling themselves [[Székely]]. Originally, the name ''Székely Land'' denoted an autonomous region within [[Transylvania]]. It existed as a legal entity from medieval times until the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], when the Székely and [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] seats were dissolved and replaced by the [[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)#Modernised counties (1867–1918)|county system]]. Along with Transylvania, it became a part of Romania in 1920, according with the [[Treaty of Trianon]] signed on 4 June 1920 at the Grand Trianon Palace in Versailles, France. In 1938–1940, during [[World War II]], post-Trianon Hungary temporarily expanded its territory and included some additional territories that were formerly part of the pre-war Kingdom of Hungary, under [[Third Reich]] auspices, the [[Second Vienna Award]]. It was later reduced to boundaries approximating those of 1920 by the peace treaties signed after World War II at Paris, in 1947. The area was called [[Magyar Autonomous Region]] between September 8, 1952 and February 16, 1968, a Hungarian autonomous region within Romania, and today there are [[Székely autonomy initiatives|territorial autonomy initiatives]] to reach a higher level of self-governance for this region within Romania.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}
* There are several [[Kosovo Serb enclaves|Serb enclaves in Kosovo]] where the institutions of [[Kosovo]] are not fully operational due to disputes.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Extraterritoriality===
Diplomatic missions, such as embassies and consulates, as well as military bases, are usually exempted from the jurisdiction of the host country, i.e., the laws of the host nation in which an embassy is located do not typically apply to the land of the embassy or base itself. This exemption from the jurisdiction of the host country is defined as [[extraterritoriality]]. Areas and buildings enjoying some forms of extraterritoriality are not true enclaves since, in all cases, the host country retains full sovereignty. In addition to embassies, some other areas enjoy a limited form of extraterritoriality.

Examples of this include:
* [[Pavillon de Breteuil]] in [[France]], used by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]].
* [[United Nations headquarters]] in the [[United States]], used by the [[United Nations]].
* [[United Nations Office at Geneva]] in [[Switzerland]], used by the [[United Nations]].
* [[INTERPOL]] headquarters in [[Lyon]], [[France]], used by [[INTERPOL]].
* [[NATO]] (political) headquarters near [[Evere]] in [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]], a part of the [[City of Brussels]], [[Belgium]].
* Headquarters of [[Allied Command Operations]] ([[NATO]]) at the area designated as [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE), north of [[Mons]], [[Belgium]].
* [[Palazzo Malta]] and the [[Villa del Priorato di Malta]], the headquarters of [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] in Rome. In addition to extraterritoriality, Italy recognizes the exercise by SMOM of all the prerogatives of sovereignty in its headquarters. Therefore, Italian sovereignty and SMOM sovereignty uniquely coexist without overlapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9LDb9lFYjVPUnFkaUVjVVdVUnM/view?usp=sharing |publisher=Analítica.com |location=Caracas, Distrito Capital, Venezuela |accessdate=October 1, 2012 |last=Arocha |first=Magaly |title= La Orden de Malta y su Naturaleza Jurídica (The Order of Malta and Its Legal Nature) |date=May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Properties of the Holy See|Extraterritorial properties of the Holy See]] in Rome and surroundings.
* By treaty of 2 November 1929, [[Czechoslovakia]] obtained the lease for 99 years of two plots of land (in the [[Moldauhafen]] and in the [[Saalehafen]]), both within the perimeter of the free port of [[Hamburg]]. Another plot, in the [[Peutehafen]], was purchased by the Czechoslovak government in 1929; this plot lies just outside the free-port perimeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lode.cz/re/clanek.php?rub=5&amp;ID=419 |title= Notification of the Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Czech Republic |date= 20 August 2001 |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.radio.cz/de/rubrik/wirtschaft/-liegt-boehmen-doch-am-meer- |title= Is Bohemia the sea? |date = 23 October 2002 |first= Jürgen |last= Siebeck |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.radio.cz/cz/rubrika/ekonomika/cesky-pristav-v-hamburku-ceka-na-zmrtvychvstani |date= 28 April 2005 |first = Zdeněk |last = Vališ |title= Czech harbor in Hamburg, waiting for resurrection |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Saalehafen – approximately 2 ha of land on Hallesches Ufer, on the southeastern bank of the Saalehafen.
** Moldauhafen – approximately 0.5 ha of land on Dresdener Ufer, on the southeastern bank of the Moldauhafen.
** Peutehafen – the narrow peninsula between the Peutekanal and the Peutehafen dock, comprising 8.054 ha of land and 0.5 ha of water surface.
* In [[Szczecin]], Poland, a similar provision existed following the [[Treaty of Versailles]] for [[Czechoslovakia]] to have access to the harbor, which until the end of World War II was located in Germany. From 1945, when Szczecin became part of Poland, Czechoslovakia possessed no extraterritorial rights there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/borderpoint/message/123 |title= Czech leased areas in Hamburg and Stettin |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that the German concession ceased at the end of the war and that no successor paid attention to the pre-war rights that Czechoslovakia had under the Versailles Treaty. Neither the Polish nor the occupying Russians appear to have assumed any of Germany's pre-war liabilities. Czechoslovakia gave up the rights to its territory in Szczecin under an agreement signed on 13 January 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Transport Agreement between the Czechoslovak Republic and the Polish People's Republic of 13 January 1956 |url=http://www.mdcr.cz/NR/rdonlyres/8D519E7F-42FF-4A41-A6AD-6753634A5F73/0/v741956.rtf |accessdate=2013-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192133/http://www.mdcr.cz/NR/rdonlyres/8D519E7F-42FF-4A41-A6AD-6753634A5F73/0/v741956.rtf |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Saimaa Canal]]: the longitudinal half of the canal in Russia is leased by Finland until 2063. Russian law is in principle valid, but in reality Finland maintains the area.

===Land owned by a foreign country===
[[File:Cook Monument Kealakekua.jpg|thumb|Land for the [[Kealakekua Bay|Captain Cook Monument]] was deeded outright to the British government by the independent nation of Hawaii in 1877]]
One or more parcels/holdings of land in most countries is owned by other countries. Most instances are exempt from taxes. In the special case of embassies/consulates these enjoy special privileges driven by [[international law|international consensus]] particularly the mutual wish to ensure free [[diplomatic mission]]s, such as being exempt from major hindrances and host-country arrests in ordinary times on the premises. Most non-embassy lands in such ownership are also not enclaves as fall legally short of ''extraterritoriality'', they are subject to alike court jurisdiction as before their grant/sale in most matters. Nonetheless, for a person's offence against the property itself, [[habeas corpus|equally valid jurisdiction]] in criminal matters is more likely than elsewhere, assuming the perpetrator is found in the prosecuting authority's homeland. Devoid of permanent residents, formally defined new [[sovereignty]] is not warranted or asserted in the examples below. Nonetheless, minor laws, especially on [[flag flying days in the United Kingdom|flag flying]], are sometimes relaxed to accommodate the needs of the accommodated nation's monument.

[[Embassy|Embassies]] enjoy many different legal statuses approaching quasi-sovereignty, depending on the agreements reached and in practice upheld from time-to-time by host nations. Subject to hosts adhering to basic due process of [[international law]], including giving warnings, the enforced reduction of scope of a foreign embassy has always been a possibility, even to the point of expelling the foreign embassy entirely, usually on a breakdown of relations, in reaction to extreme actions such as [[espionage]], or as another form of sanction. The same seems to be possible in profit-driven moving or drilling under any of the sites below, providing safeguards as the structure or a new replacement site. The same possible curtailments and alterations never apply to proper exclaves.

Examples of such land other than for diplomatic missions are:

* The [[Tomb of Suleyman Shah]] (of [[Suleyman Shah]], the grandfather of [[Osman I]], the founder of the [[Ottoman Empire]]) in [[Aleppo Governorate]], [[Syria]], is the property of [[Turkey]]. Article 9 of the [[Treaty of Ankara (1921)|Treaty of Ankara]] signed between [[France]] and Turkey in 1921, provides that the tomb "shall remain, with its appurtenances, the property of Turkey, who may appoint guardians for it and may hoist the Turkish flag there".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Franco-Turkish agreement of Ankara |url=http://www.hri.org/docs/FT1921/Franco-Turkish_Pact_1921.pdf |accessdate=8 August 2014 |language=French, English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unusual cross-border transport channels==

===National railway passing through another state's territory===
Changes in borders can make a railway that was previously located solely within a country traverse the new borders. Since diverting a railway is expensive, this arrangement may last a long time. This may mean that doors on passenger trains are locked and guarded to prevent illicit entry and exit while the train is temporarily in another country. Borders can also be in the "wrong" place, forcing railways into difficult terrain.

Examples include:

====Europe====
Current
* [[Salzburg]] to [[Innsbruck]] (Austria) (passes through [[Rosenheim]], Germany). A railway line within Austria exists as well, but trains take about 1.5 hours longer than across German territory.
* Trains on the [[Birsig Valley Line]] from [[Basel]] to [[Rodersdorf]], Switzerland, which passes through [[Leymen]], France. It is operated by [[Baselland Transport]] and serviced by [[10 line (BLT)|line no. 10]], which continues into the [[Trams in Basel|Basel tram network]].
* The [[Hochrheinbahn]] ([[Upper Rhine Railway]]) from [[Basel]] via [[Waldshut-Tiengen|Waldshut]] to [[Schaffhausen]] is part of the [[Deutsche Bahn]] network, and is mostly in Germany, but the two ends are in Switzerland and it is only connected with the rest of the German railway network via Switzerland. At both Basel and Schaffhausen the railway has [[extraterritorial]] status: one can travel by train to and from the rest of Germany without going through Swiss customs. See [[Basel Badischer Bahnhof]].
* Trains from [[Neugersdorf]], [[Saxony]] to [[Zittau]] pass Czech territory at [[Varnsdorf]], while Czech trains from Varnsdorf to [[Chrastava]] pass through German territory at Zittau, and then a small part of Polish territory near the village of [[Porajów]].
* Trains from [[Görlitz]] to [[Zittau]], Germany, pass the border river [[Neisse]] several times (see [[Oder–Neisse line]]); the railway station for [[Ostritz]], Germany, lies in Krzewina Zgorzelecka, Poland.
* [[Belgrade–Bar railway]] crosses into [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] for {{convert|9|km}}, between stations Zlatibor and Priboj (both in [[Serbia]]). There is one station, [[Štrpci]], but there are no border-crossing facilities, and trains do not call at the station.
* The Knin – Bihać railway between Croatia and Bosnia is split by the Croatian–Bosnian border several times. Similarly, the Savski Marof – Imeno railway was split by the Slovenian–Croatian border several times.
* [[Lučenec]] – [[Veľký Krtíš]] line in [[Slovakia]] passes through Hungary from [[Ipolytarnóc]] to [[Nógrádszakál]].
* The local trains on the [[Burgenlandbahn]] in Austria cross the area of Hungary at [[Sopron]]. During the era of the Iron Curtain, the trains had their doors locked as they traversed Hungarian territory.
* The line from [[Ventimiglia]] to [[Limone Piemonte]], Italy, via [[Breil-sur-Roya]], France.
* The railway between France and [[Italy]] briefly leaves France to enter [[Monaco]] in a 150-metre tunnel before entering France once more.
* For the Belgian [[Vennbahn]] (now a cycleway) narrow strips of Belgian territory were created running through Germany, creating five German exclaves.
* The former Soviet republics have numerous examples:{{clarify|date=April 2014}}
** [[Semikhody]] – [[Chernihiv]] line of [[Ukraine]] passes through [[Belarus]] territory.&lt;ref name="RailwayGazette"&gt;[[Railway Gazette International]] April 2008 p 240&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Belarus]]/[[Lithuania]]: [[Adutiškis]] railway station straddles the Lithuania/Belarus border. Trains pass through Lithuanian territory while traveling to and from Belarus, and platforms are in both Belarus and Lithuania. The station is now mainly used for freight.
** [[Druzhba (city)|Druzhba]] – [[Vorozhba]] line of [[Ukraine]] passes through Russian territory.&lt;ref name="RailwayGazette" /&gt;
** In 2009, Russia and Kazakhstan agreed to transfer ownership of a cross-border section of line.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}

Historic
* During the [[Cold War]], underground lines in [[West Berlin]] ran under parts of [[East Berlin]]. [[Ghost station]]s ({{lang-de|Geisterbahnhöfe}}) were stations on Berlin's [[Berlin U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] and [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] metro networks that were closed during this period of Berlin's division.

Proposals
* The shortest and straightest route for a proposed east–west high-speed railway in Austria through [[Linz]], [[Salzburg]] and [[Innsbruck]] would pass under some mountains belonging to Germany.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

====Africa====
[[File:Map Mauritania Railway.png|thumb|The [[Mauritania Railway]]. The inset shows the shorter route cutting through [[Western Sahara]] and the longer route within [[Mauritania]] through difficult terrain.]]
* Due to inability to agree in 1963 on a shorter route through easy terrain, the [[Mauritania Railway|iron ore railway]] in [[Mauritania]] originally had to use a longer route through a tunnel (built through 2&amp;nbsp;km of solid [[granite]]) near [[Choum]] to avoid the territory of [[Spanish Sahara]]. The tunnel is no longer in use and trains now use the shorter route through 5&amp;nbsp;km of [[Western Sahara]]n territory controlled by the [[Polisario Front]].
* In 2012, a [[Rail transport in Angola#Caminho de Ferro do Congo|railway route]] from Angola proper to the enclave of [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] has to cross not only the [[Congo River]] but also the territory of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].
* In 2013, the shortest railway route from coal mines at [[Tete]] to a port at [[Nacala]] passes through [[Malawi]]. A route through all-[[Mozambique]] territory is circuitous.
* In 1928, Congo (Belgium) and Angola (Portugal) exchanged some land to facilitate the new route of the railway to Congo-Kinshasa.&lt;ref&gt;[Railways Africa 2014 issue 5, p29]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Middle East====
* A very short length of the Syrian [[Homs]]–[[Tripoli]] line crosses the border into Lebanon. This happens because the railway was built before this border was defined.

====The Americas====
* [[Bolivia]] is landlocked and has no access to the sea, but a [[Arica–La Paz railway|rail route]] runs through [[Chile]] from La Paz to the port of Arica on the Pacific Ocean. The rail route was built by Chile under the [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1904 between Chile and Bolivia]], with the Bolivian section transferred to Bolivia after 15 years. Bolivia enjoyed duty-free use of the railway and the ports connected.
* The [[International Railway of Maine]] was a railroad constructed by the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) between [[Lac-Mégantic, Quebec|Lac-Mégantic]], [[Quebec]], and [[Mattawamkeag, Maine|Mattawamkeag]], [[Maine]], closing a key gap in the railway's transcontinental main line to the port of [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], [[New Brunswick]].&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{cite book| title=The Best of Maine Railroads |author=Johnson, Ron |publisher=Portland Litho |year=1985 |isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The railway was however, at all times under American jurisdiction with the borders of the United States.
* In order to avoid such a trans-border arrangement, the [[United States]] made the [[Gadsden Purchase]] of land from [[Mexico]], on which it was planned to build a southern route for the [[transcontinental railroad]]. Owing to the topography of the area, acquisition of the land was the only feasible way to construct such a railroad through the southern [[New Mexico Territory]].

===Highway of one state passing through another state's territory===
This arrangement is less common as highways are more easily re-aligned. Examples include:

====Africa====
* [[Congo Pedicle road]]: built to provide access for [[Zambia]]'s [[Luapula Province]] to the [[Copperbelt]] through {{convert|70|km}} of territory of the [[DR Congo]], requiring a change in [[driving on the left]] to driving on the right.
* In [[Guinea]], where 20&amp;nbsp;km long tunnel(s) through a hillspur at [[Naigaya]] (elevation {{convert|411|m}}), [[Sicourou]], [[Bokariadi]] and [[Feraya]] might be avoided by crossing the border into [[Sierra Leone]] at [[Yana, Sierra Leone|Yana]] (elevation {{convert|87|m}}).{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
* [[Senegal]] is practically and inconveniently divided in two by the sovereign territory of [[Gambia]]. The easiest way to travel from northern Senegal to the southern [[Casamance]] region is through Gambia via the [[Trans-Gambia Highway]], with a connecting ferry being the only way to cross the [[Gambia River]]. The fare for the ferry crossing is a source of contention between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4267846.stm | work=BBC News | title=Senegal may tunnel under Gambia | date=2005-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Project-and-Operations/Multinational__The_Gambia-Senegal__-_AR_-_Construction_of_the_Trans-Gambia_Bridge_and_Cross_Border_Improvement_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, a road bridge is under construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statehouse.gm/50th-independence-golden-jubilee_2015/laying-foundation-stone-trans-gambia-bridge_20022015.htm |title=Office of The Gambian President: State House Online: Yahya A.J.J.

====Asia====
* The road from [[Dubai]] to the tourist spot of [[Hatta, United Arab Emirates|Hatta]], an [[exclave]] of the emirate of Dubai, passes through a small stretch of [[Oman]]i territory.
*The highway between [[Bishkek]] and [[Issyk Kul]], both in [[Kyrgyzstan]], skirts the border with [[Kazakhstan]], with the highway and the border crossing each other for short distances at various points.

====Europe====
* Various roads crossing the [[Republic of Ireland–United Kingdom border|border]] back and forth between the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. The N54 in [[County Monaghan|County Monaghan, Ireland]] twice becomes the A3 in [[County Fermanagh|County Fermanagh, NI]], before continuing as the N54. Similarly, the N53 in Monaghan passes through [[County Armagh|County Armagh, NI]] as the A37, before resuming as the N53 at the border between Monaghan and [[County Louth|County Louth, Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;2006 Road Atlas Ireland, AA, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;  No national or county {{dubious|date=September 2015}} border signs are present.
* Between 1963 and 2002 the N274 road from [[Roermond]] to [[Heerlen]], part of Dutch territory, passed through the German [[Selfkant]], which had been annexed by the [[Netherlands]] after the Second World War but returned to Germany in 1963.
* Close to [[Narvik]], a road from [[Norway]] twice enters and leaves [[Sweden|Swedish]] territory, following the southern shore of the [[Kjårdavatnet]] lake. It does not connect with any other Swedish road in either location before it enters Norwegian land once more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geosite.jankrogh.com/borders/other/soerdalen.htm Jan S. Krogh's Geosite on Sørdalen valley]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/68.0965874,17.3893175/68.0972972,17.2465952/@68.0802842,17.2346506,9734m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!4m1!3e0|title=Driving directions|website=Google maps|publisher=[[Google]]|access-date=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Road 402 between [[Podsabotin]] and [[Solkan]] in [[Slovenia]], built when Slovenia was a state of [[Yugoslavia]], passes through part of [[Italy]]. The road is confined by high concrete walls topped by fences; as Slovenia and Italy are now both signatories to the [[Schengen agreement]], the barriers are little more than historical curiosities.
* The [[Saatse Boot]] Road in [[Estonia]], between the villages of [[Lutepää]] and [[Sesniki]], passes through [[Pechory|Russian territory]]. The stretch of road passing through [[Russia]] is flanked by barbed wire fences and guard towers. Stopping and/or getting out of one's vehicle on the stretch of road is forbidden; the rule is enforced by Russian border guards.
* The [[D8 road (Croatia)|D8]] coastal highway of [[Croatia]] passes through a small section of [[Herzegovina]] territory, at the Herzegovinian town of [[Neum]], as it heads south from [[Split, Croatia|Split]] to [[Dubrovnik]].

====The Americas====
* [[East Richford–Glen Sutton Border Crossing|East Richford]] Slide Road in the US state of [[Vermont]] crosses in to the Canadian province of [[Québec]] for a distance of approximately 100 meters (300 feet) before returning to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/maps/place/E+Richford+Slide+Rd,+Richford,+VT+05476/@45.0112337,-72.5815797,18z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4cb604df404aca4f:0x330ba65efe040f37 Google Maps]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subnational highway passing through other internal territory===
* [[India]]
** The highway connecting [[Guwahati]] (capital of [[Assam]] state) to [[Silchar]] (a city in [[Barak valley]] of Assam) passes through [[Meghalaya]] state.
** One has to travel through part of [[West Bengal]] while travelling from [[Jamshedpur]] (Tatanagar), [[Jharkhand]] to few other cities of Jharkahand like [[Ranchi]] or [[Dhanbad]].
** [[Kota, Rajasthan|Kota]], a city in [[Rajasthan]] surrounded by territory of [[Madhya Pradesh]], is connected to other parts of Rajasthan by roads passing through Madhya Pradesh.
** [[Gwalior]] (Madhya Pradesh) is connected to few other cities of Madhya Pradesh by highways passing through [[Uttar Pradesh]], covering the city of [[Jhansi]].
* [[United States]]:
** [[Interstate 684]], connecting various points in [[New York State]], passes through [[Connecticut]] near [[Kensico Reservoir]] and [[Westchester County Airport]] but is maintained entirely by New York State. Motor vehicles cannot enter from nor exit to Connecticut roads, even though a portion of the highway is owned by Connecticut.
** A portion of [[New York State Route 17]]/[[Interstate 86 (Pennsylvania–New York)|Interstate 86]] passes through South Waverly, [[Pennsylvania]] but is maintained entirely by New York State. This includes the roadway and traffic lights at the interchange with [[US Route 220]] and a short portion of [[Pennsylvania Route 199]]. Nevertheless, Pennsylvania police enforce traffic laws on this short stretch, where there is one overpass built and owned by Pennsylvania.
** A {{convert|2.0|mi}} portion of [[New Hampshire Route 153]] runs along the border with and briefly passes through [[Parsonsfield, Maine]] as it sweeps around the eastern shore of [[Province Lake]].
** [[Minnesota State Highway 23]] passes through about {{convert|0.57|mi}} of [[Wisconsin]] just west of [[Duluth, Minnesota]].&lt;ref name="WI Hwys 20-29"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhighways.org/listings/WiscHwys20-29.html#MN-023 |title=Highways 20–29 |author=Bessert, Christopher J |work=Wisconsin Highways |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MN Hwys 1-25"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.steve-riner.com/mnhighways/r1-25.htm#23 |title=Details of Routes 1–25 |author=Riner, Steve |work=The Unofficial Minnesota Highways Page |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintained by the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]], it intersects only a few dead-end local roads while in Wisconsin.

** Hopkins Road north of [[Newark, Delaware]], briefly enters [[Pennsylvania]] where the [[Twelve-Mile Circle]] meets the [[Mason–Dixon Line]]. The road is maintained by [[Delaware]], and it appears that at one time Arc Corner Road in Pennsylvania may have intersected here. Further east, Beaver Dam Road enters [[Chadds Ford Township, Pennsylvania]] at the intersection of Beaver Valley Road and re-enters Delaware about 0.5 miles later. The section of road in Pennsylvania is in rough shape, and it is unclear who is supposed to maintain this section.
*[[Turkey]]:
** The main road for travel to [[Bartın]] via [[Zonguldak]] actually crosses Bartın first, traverses Zonguldak a short distance, then returns to Bartın.

===Border transport infrastructure===
====Europe====
* Several bridges cross the rivers [[Oder]] and [[Neisse]] between Germany and Poland. To avoid needing to coordinate their efforts on a single bridge, the two [[riparian]] states assign each bridge to one or the other; thus Poland is responsible for ''all'' maintenance on some of the bridges, including the German side, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railwaygazette.com/ur_single/article/2008/03/8286/border_bridges_rebuilt.html Railway Gazette: Border bridges rebuilt] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503201143/http://www.railwaygazette.com/ur_single/article/2008/03/8286/border_bridges_rebuilt.html |date=May 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Hallein Salt Mine]] crosses from [[Austria]] into [[Germany]]. Under an 1829 treaty Austria can dig under the then-Kingdom of [[Bavaria]]. In return some salt has to be given to Bavaria, and up to 99 of its citizens can be hired to work in the Austrian mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rVwBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=hallein%2Btreaty%2B1829&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0TGqi_CRLH&amp;sig=frjYjGM2bZDIAsnMICsAEl_n1Qg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qtMyS_-SBoH7nAeM2KD8CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CA0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=hallein%2Btreaty%2B1829&amp;f=false |title=The log of the Water Lily, p. 84 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The twin town of TornioHaparanda or HaparandaTornio lies at the mouth of river Tornio, [[Tornio]] on the [[Finland|Finnish]] side and [[Haparanda]] on the [[Sweden|Swedish]] side. The two towns have a common public transportation, as well as cultural services, fire brigade, sports facilities etc.
* The [[Basel Badischer Bahnhof]] is a railway station in the Swiss city of Basel. Although situated on Swiss soil, because of the 1852 treaty between the Swiss Confederation and the state of Baden (one of the predecessors of today's Germany), the largest part of the station (the platforms and the parts of the passenger tunnel that lead to the German/Swiss checkpoint) is treated administratively as an inner-German railway station operated by the [[Deutsche Bahn]]. The shops in the station hall, however, are Swiss, and the Swiss franc is used as the official currency there (although the euro is universally accepted). The Swiss post office, car rental office, restaurant and a cluster of shops are each separately located wholly within a surrounding station area that is administered by the German railway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bahn.de/extrahtml/pdf/bahnhofsplaene/basel.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930022326/http://www.bahn.de/extrahtml/pdf/bahnhofsplaene/basel.pdf | archivedate=2007-09-30 |title= Ihr Bahnhof Basel Bad Bf |accessdate = 2013-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The customs controls are located in a tunnel between the platforms and the station hall; international trains which continue to [[Basel SBB]] usually have on-board border controls.
*The [[Strasbourg tramway|tram network]] in the French city of [[Strasbourg]] was extended into the neighbouring German city of [[Kehl]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/grand-est/alsace/tram-strasbourg-kehl-bons-rails-1263487.html | title = Le tram Strasbourg-Kehl sur de bons rails ! | date = May 30, 2017 | work = Franceinfo | accessdate = June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Asia====
* The [[Hong Kong–Shenzhen Western Corridor]] on the [[Hong Kong]]–[[mainland China]] border: the [[Port of entry|immigration control point]]s for Hong Kong ([[Shenzhen Bay Control Point]]) and mainland China ([[Shenzhen Bay Port]]) are co-located in the same building on the [[Shenzhen]] side of the bridge in an effective pene-exclave. The Hong Kong portion of the service building and the adjoining bridge are leased to Hong Kong, and are under Hong Kong's jurisdiction for an initial period until 30 June 2047.
* The [[Hong Kong West Kowloon railway station#Mainland Port Area|Mainland Port Area]] in [[Hong Kong West Kowloon railway station|Kowloon High Speed Railway Station]] in downtown [[Hong Kong]] is under the jurisdiction of the Mainland Chinese authorities and courts.  The 30 km long underground tunnel to the border is under Hong Kong jurisdiction, however, the train compartments of any train in operation (that is carrying passengers to or from the Mainland) are subject to Mainland Laws and jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/legis/ord/632/ Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link (Co-Location) Ordinance&lt;/ref&gt;.  This arrangement was created to allow for immigration clearance to occur in Hong Kong for all trains travelling to and from the Mainland of China.
* As a legacy of the British colonial period, the [[Malaysia]]n rail network had its southern terminus at [[Tanjong Pagar railway station]] in central [[Singapore]]. The land on which the station and the rail tracks stood was leased to [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]], the Malaysian state railway operator. Consequently, Malaysia had partial sovereignty over the railway land.&lt;ref name="SingaporeKTM"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/transport/story/the-straits-times-archives-points-agreement-malayan-railway-land-sing |title=From The Straits Times Archives: Malayan Railway land in Singapore |date=31 October 2014 |newspaper=The Straits Times |accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passengers had to clear Malaysian customs and immigration checks at Tanjong Pagar before boarding the train to Malaysia, even after Singapore shifted its border control facility to the actual border in 1998 and objected to the continued presence of Malaysian officials at the station. After a [[Malaysia–Singapore Points of Agreement of 1990|20-year long dispute]], the station was closed in 2011 and the railway land reverted to Singapore.&lt;ref name="SingaporeKTM" /&gt; A remnant of the rail corridor is still in use; KTM trains now terminate at [[Woodlands Train Checkpoint]] in northern Singapore near the border, which houses Malaysian and Singaporean border controls for rail passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/story/?file=%2F2010%2F5%2F24%2Fnation%2F20100524150610 |title=KTM Tg Pagar station will move to Woodlands in S'pore July 1, 2011 (Update) |date=24 May 2010 |newspaper=The Star (Malaysia) |accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rest of Zealandia includes the [[Challenger Plateau]] and [[Lord Howe Rise]], which stretch from Northwest of New Zealand almost to Northern Australia, and the [[Campbell Plateau]] and [[Chatham Rise]], to the southeast of New Zealand.]]
The [[geology]] of [[New Zealand]] is noted for its [[volcanic]] activity, [[earthquake]]s and [[geothermal]] [[Geothermal areas in New Zealand|areas]] because of its position on the boundary of the [[Australian Plate]] and [[Pacific Plate]]s. New Zealand is part of [[Zealandia]], a [[microcontinent]] nearly half the size of Australia that broke away from the [[Gondwana]]n supercontinent about 83 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wallis | first1 = G.

New Zealand's geology can be simplified into three phases. First the [[basement rock|basement rocks]] of New Zealand formed. These rocks were once part of the super-continent of Gondwana, along with [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Madagascar]], [[India]], [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]]. The rocks that now form the, mostly submerged, continent of Zealandia were then nestled between Eastern Australia and [[Western Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/Geology/GeologyOverview/3/ENZ-Resources/Standard/1/en#breadcrumbtop New Zealand within Gondwana] from Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly New Zealand drifted away from Gondwana and many [[sedimentary basins]] formed, which later became the [[sedimentary rock]]s covering the geological basement. The final phase is represented by the uplift of the [[Southern Alps]] and the eruptions of the [[Taupo Volcanic Zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.geotrips.org.nz/downloads/Ballance_NZ_Geology-V2.pdf |title= New Zealand Geology: an illustrated guide |website= www.geotrips.org.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Basement rocks (Cambrian-Cretaceous)==
{{See also|Stratigraphy of New Zealand}}
[[File:New Zealand geology map with key.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5]]

New Zealand's [[basement rocks]] range in age from mid-[[Cambrian]] in north-west [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] to [[Cretaceous]] near [[Kaikoura]]. These rocks were formed in a [[Ocean|marine]] environment before New Zealand separated from Gondwana. They are divided into the "Western Province", consisting mainly of [[greywacke]], [[granite]] and [[gneiss]], and an "Eastern Province", consisting mainly of [[greywacke]] and [[schist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mortimer |first1=N |date=2004 |title=New Zealand's geological foundations. |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1342937X05703245 |journal=Gondwana Research |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=261-272 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The provinces are further divided into [[terranes]] – large slices of crust with different geological histories that have been brought together by tectonic activity ([[subduction]] and [[strike-slip faulting]]) to form New Zealand.

The Western Province is older than the Eastern Province and outcrops along the west coast of the South Island from [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] to [[Fiordland]]. The Western Province is divided into the [[Buller Terrane|Buller]] and [[Takaka Terrane|Takaka]] terranes which formed in mid-Cambrian to [[Devonian]] time (510–400 Ma). This includes New Zealand's oldest rocks, [[trilobite]] containing greywacke, which are found in the [[Cobb River, New Zealand|Cobb Valley]] in north-west Nelson.&lt;ref name="Mortimer2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mortimer|first1=N.|title=New Zealand's Geological Foundations|journal=Gondwana Research|volume=7|issue=1|year=2004|pages=261–272|issn=1342937X|doi=10.1016/S1342-937X(05)70324-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large sections of the of Western Province have been intruded by [[plutonic]] rocks or [[metamorphism|metamorphosed]] to gneiss. These plutonic basement rocks are subdivided into the [[Hohonu Batholith|Hohonu]], [[Karamea Batholith|Karamea]], [[Median Batholith|Median]] and [[Paparoa Batholith|Paparoa]] [[batholith]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://data.gns.cri.nz/ |title= New Zealand Stratigraphic Lexicon |last= |first= |date=|website= |publisher=GNS Science |access-date=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rocks form the foundations beneath offshore [[Taranaki]], and much of the [[West Coast (New Zealand)|West Coast]], [[Buller District|Buller]], north-west [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], [[Fiordland]] and [[Stewart Island]].  Most of these plutonic rocks were formed in [[Devonian]]-[[Carboniferous]] time (380–335 Ma) and [[Jurassic]]-[[Cretaceous]] time (155–100 Ma). The Median Batholith represents a long-lived batholith dividing the Western and Eastern Provinces. Before Zealandia's separation from [[Gondwana]] it stretched from [[Queensland]], through what is now New Zealand, into West Antarctica.  It marks the site of a former subduction zone on the edge of Gondwana.

The Eastern Province underlies more of New Zealand than the Western Province, including the greywacke and schist of the Southern Alps and all of the basement rocks of the North Island. The Eastern Province contains seven main terranes, the [[Drumduan Terrane|Drumduan]], [[Brook Street Terrane|Brook Street]], [[Murihiku Terrane|Murihiku]], [[Dun Mountain-Maitai Terrane|Dun Mountain-Maitai]], [[Caples Terrane|Caples]], [[Torlesse Composite Terrane|Torlesse Composite]] (Rakaia, Aspiring and Pahau terranes) and [[Waipapa Terrane|Waipapa]] Composite (Morrinsville and Hunua Terranes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mortimer |first1=N. |last2=Rattenbury |first2=M. S. |last3=King |first3=P. R.|last4=Bland |first4=K. J.|last5=Barrell |first5= D. J. A.|last6=Bache |first6=F.|last7=Begg  |first7= J. G.|title=High-level stratigraphic scheme for New Zealand rocks. |url= |journal=New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=402-419 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are mostly composed of greywacke together with [[argillite]], except for the Brook Street and Dun Mountain-Maitai Terranes which have significant igneous components (see [[Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt]]). New Zealand's greywacke is mostly from the Caples, Torlesse Composite (Rakaia and Pahau) and Waipapa Composite (Morrinsville and Hunua) terranes formed in Carboniferous-Cretaceous time (330–120 Ma).  Much of these rocks were deposited as [[submarine fan]]s.  They have different origins, as shown by different chemical compositions and different [[fossils]]. In general, the sedimentary basement terranes become younger from West to East across the country, as the newer terranes were scraped off the subducting paleo-[[Pacific Plate]], and [[Accretion (geology)|accreted]] to the boundary of Gondwana over hundreds of millions of years.

Many rocks in the Eastern Province have been metamorphosed into the [[Haast Schist]], due to exposure to high pressures and temperatures.  Rocks grade continuously from greywacke (e.g., in Canterbury) to high-grade schist (e.g., around the Caples-Torlesse boundary in [[Otago]] and [[Marlborough Region|Marlborough]], and [[Torlesse Composite Terrane|Torlesse]] rocks just to the East of the Alpine Fault). The Alpine Fault that corresponds to the line of the [[Southern Alps]] has separated the basement rocks that used to be adjacent by about 480 km.

==Separation from Gondwana (Cretaceous-Eocene)==

The Australia-New Zealand continental fragment of Gondwana split from the rest of Gondwana in the late Cretaceous time (95–90 Ma). Then around 83 Ma, Zealandia started to separate from Australia forming the [[Tasman Sea]], initially separating from the south.  By 75 Ma, Zealandia was essentially separate from Australia and Antarctica, although only shallow seas might have separated Zealandia and Australia in the north. [[Dinosaur]]s continued to live in New Zealand after it separated from Gondwana, as shown by [[sauropod]] footprints from 70 million years ago in Nelson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/science/83962010/dinosaur-footprints-found-in-nelson-on-show-in-lower-hutt |title=Dinosaur footprints found in Nelson on show in Lower Hutt |last= |first= |date= |website=www.stuff.co.nz |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Cretaceous extension large [[Fault (geology)|normal faults]] formed throughout New Zealand. this meant that dinosaurs had about 20 million years to evolve unique New Zealand species. The Hawks Crag Breccia formed next to their [[Fault scarp|scarps]] and it has become New Zealand's best [[uranium]] [[mineral deposit]].&lt;ref name="BeckReed1958"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beck|first1=A. C.|last2=Reed|first2=J. J.|last3=Willett|first3=R. W.|title=Uranium mineralization in the Hawks Crag Breccia of the Lower Buller Gorge Region, South Island, New Zealand|journal=New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics|volume=1|issue=3|year=1958|pages=432–450|issn=0028-8306|doi=10.1080/00288306.1958.10422773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, New Zealand has no native snakes or land mammals (other than bats). Both [[marsupials]] and [[placental]] mammals did not evolve and reach Australia in time to be on New Zealand when it drifted away 85 million years ago. The evolution and dispersal of snakes is less certain, but there is no hard evidence of them being in Australia before the opening of the Tasman Sea.&lt;ref name="ScanlonLee2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scanlon|first1=John D.|last2=Lee|first2=Michael S.Y.|last3=Archer|first3=Michael|title=Mid-Tertiary elapid snakes (Squamata, Colubroidea) from Riversleigh, northern Australia: early steps in a continent-wide adaptive radiation|journal=Geobios|volume=36|issue=5|year=2003|pages=573–601|issn=00166995|doi=10.1016/S0016-6995(03)00056-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[multituberculates]], another type of mammal which is now extinct, may have been in time to cross the land bridge to New Zealand.&lt;ref name="YuanJi2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yuan|first1=C.-X.|last2=Ji|first2=Q.|last3=Meng|first3=Q.-J.|last4=Tabrum|first4=A.

The landmasses continued to separate until early [[Eocene]] times (53 Ma). The Tasman Sea, and part of Zealandia then locked together with Australia to form the [[Australian Plate]] (40 Ma), and a new plate boundary was created between the Australian Plate and [[Pacific Plate]].  Zealandia ended up at a pivot point between the Pacific and Australian Plates, with spreading in the south, and convergence in the north, where the Pacific Plate was subducted beneath the Australian Plate.  A precursor to the [[Kermadec Arc]] was created.  The convergent part of the plate boundary propagated through Zealandia from the north, eventually forming a proto-Alpine Fault in [[Miocene]] times (23 Ma).  The various ridges and basins north of New Zealand relate to previous positions of the [[plate boundary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/Geology/GeologyOverview/6/ENZ-Resources/Standard/1/en#breadcrumbtop New Zealand splits from Gondwana] from Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sedimentary basins and allochthons (Cretaceous-Recent)==
{{See also|Stratigraphy of New Zealand}}
[[File:Cape Farewell Arch.jpg|thumb|left|Sedimentary rocks from an uplifted basin. Cape Farewell, South Island]]
[[Erosion]] and [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] has lead to much of Zealandia now being covered in sedimentary rocks that formed in swamps and [[oceanic basin|marine sedimentary basins]]. Much of New Zealand was low lying around Mid [[Eocene]]-[[Oligocene]] times (40–23 Ma).  Swamps became widespread, forming [[coal]].  The land subsided further, and marine organisms produced [[limestone]] deposits.  Limestone of Oligocene-Early [[Miocene]] age formed in many areas, including the [[King Country]], known for the [[Waitomo Glowworm Cave]]. In the South Island, limestone is present in Buller, Nelson, and the [[West Coast (New Zealand)|West Coast]], including the [[Pancake Rocks]] at [[Punakaiki]] in Oligocene-Early Miocene times (34–15 Ma). It is debated whether all of New Zealand was submerged at this time or if small islands remained as "arcs" preserving fauna and flora.&lt;ref name="KnappMudaliar2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knapp|first1=Michael|last2=Mudaliar|first2=Ragini|last3=Havell|first3=David|last4=Wagstaff|first4=Steven J.|last5=Lockhart|first5=Peter J.|last6=Paterson|first6=Adrian|title=The Drowning of New Zealand and the Problem of Agathis|journal=Systematic Biology|volume=56|issue=5|year=2007|pages=862–870|issn=1076-836X|doi=10.1080/10635150701636412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[allochthon]] is land that formed elsewhere and slid on top of other land (in other words, the material of an enormous landslide).  Much of the land of [[Northland Region|Northland]] and [[East Cape]] were created in this manner.&lt;ref name="JiaoSeward2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiao|first1=Ruohong|last2=Seward|first2=Diane|last3=Little|first3=Timothy A.|last4=Herman|first4=Frédéric|last5=Kohn|first5=Barry P.|title=Constraining provenance, thickness and erosion of nappes using low-temperature thermochronology: the Northland Allochthon, New Zealand|journal=Basin Research|volume=29|issue=1|year=2017|pages=81–95|issn=0950091X|doi=10.1111/bre.12166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 25–22 Ma, Northland and East Cape were adjacent, with East Cape near [[Whangarei]].  Northland-East Cape was an undersea basin. Much of the land that now forms Northland-East Cape was higher land to the Northeast (composed of rocks formed 90–25 Ma).  The Pacific-Australian plate boundary was further to the Northeast, with the Pacific Plate subducting under the Australian Plate. Layers of rocks were peeled off the higher land, from the top down, and slid Southwest under the influence of gravity, to be stacked the right way up, but in reverse order. Most of the material to slide were sedimentary rocks, however, the last rocks to be slid across were slabs of [[oceanic crust]] ([[ophiolite]]s), mainly [[basalt]].  Widespread volcanic activity also occurred (23–15 Ma), and is intermixed with the foreign rocks. Sedimentary basins formed on the allochthons while they were moving.  East Cape was later separated from Northland and moved further south and east to its present position.

==Volcanic activity==
{{Main article|Volcanism of New Zealand}}

Volcanism is recorded in New Zealand throughout its whole geological history. Most volcanism in New Zealand, both modern and ancient, has been caused by the subduction of one tectonic plate under another, this causes melting in the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], the layer of the earth below the crust. This produces a [[volcanic arc]], composed of mainly [[basalt]], [[andesitic]] and [[rhyolitic]]. Basaltic eruptions tend to be fairly placid, producing scoria cones and lava flows, such as the volcanic cones in the [[Auckland volcanic field]], although [[Mount Tarawera]]'s violent 1886 eruption was an exception. Andesitic eruptions tend to form steep [[stratovolcanoes]], including mountains such as [[Mount Ruapehu|Ruapehu]], [[Tongariro]] and [[Taranaki]], islands such as [[Little Barrier Island|Little Barrier]], [[Whakaari / White Island|White]] and [[Raoul Island]]s, or submarine [[seamount]]s like [[Monowai Seamount]].  Rhyolitic eruptions with large amounts of water tend to cause violent eruptions, producing [[calderas]], such as [[Lake Taupo]] and [[Lake Rotorua]]. New Zealand also has many volcanoes which are not clearly related to plate subduction including the extinct [[Dunedin Volcano]] and [[Banks Peninsula]], and the dormant [[Auckland Volcanic Field]].

===Extinct volcanoes===

The South Island has no currently active volcanoes.  However, in the late [[Cretaceous]] (100–65 Ma), there was widespread volcanic activity in Marlborough, West Coast, Canterbury and Otago; and in [[Eocene]] times (40 Ma), there was volcanic activity in [[Oamaru]].  The most well known [[Miocene]] volcanic centres are the intra-plate [[Dunedin Volcano]] and [[Banks Peninsula]]s. The Dunedin Volcano which later eroded to form [[Otago Peninsula]] near [[Dunedin]] was built up by a series of mainly basaltic intra-plate volcanic eruptions in Miocene times (16–10 Ma).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.otago.ac.nz/geology/people/students/martin_u/index.html ''"Eruptions and deposition of volcaniclastic rocks in the Dunedin Volcanic Complex, Otago Peninsula, New Zealand"'', Ulrike Martin]&lt;/ref&gt; Banks Peninsula near [[Christchurch]] was built from two mainly basaltic intra-plate volcanoes in Miocene times (12–6 Ma and 9.5–7.5 Ma), corresponding to the [[Lyttelton Harbour|Lyttelton]] and [[Akaroa]] Harbours. Southland's [[Solander Islands]] were active around 1 to 2 million years ago. There are also minor volcanic from a similar time period throughout Canterbury, Otago and also on the [[Chatham Islands]]. 

[[File:Pillow lava Oamaru New Zealand.jpg|thumb|Ancient underwater volcanic eruptions ([[pillow lava]]) near [[Oamaru]].]] 

Intra-plate basaltic volcanic eruptions also occurred in the North Island, near the [[Bay of Islands]] in Northland, in the Late Miocene (10 Mya), and again more recently (0.5 Mya).  The [[South Auckland volcanic field]] was active in [[Pleistocene]] times (1.5–0.5 Ma).  The [[Auckland volcanic field]] started erupting around 250,000 years ago. It includes around 50 distinct eruptions, with most of the prominent cones formed in the last 30,000 years, and the most recent eruption, which formed [[Rangitoto Island]], around 600 years ago. The field is currently dormant and further eruptions are expected. Over time the volcanic field has slowly been drifting northwards.&lt;ref name="MolloyShane2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Molloy|first1=Catherine|last2=Shane|first2=Phil|last3=Augustinus|first3=Paul|title=Eruption recurrence rates in a basaltic volcanic field based on tephra layers in maar sediments: Implications for hazards in the Auckland volcanic field|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin|volume=121|issue=11-12|year=2009|pages=1666–1677|issn=0016-7606|doi=10.1130/B26447.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volcanism in the North Island has been dominated by a series of volcanic arcs which have evolved into the still active [[Taupo Volcanic Zone]]. Over time, volcanic activity has moved south and east, as the plate boundary moved eastward. This started in Miocene times (23 Ma) when a volcanic arc became active to the west of Northland, and gradually moved South down to [[New Plymouth]], where [[Mount Taranaki/Egmont|Taranaki]] is still active. It produced mainly andesitic strato-volcanoes. The Northland volcanoes include the volcanoes that produced the [[Waipoua Plateau]] (site of [[Waipoua Forest]], with large [[Kauri]] trees) and [[Kaipara District|Kaipara]] volcano. The Waitakere volcano (22–16 Ma) has mainly been eroded, but [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] from the volcano forms the [[Waitakere Ranges]], and produced most of the material that makes up the [[Waitemata sandstones]] and mudstones.&lt;ref name="Hayward1979"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayward|first1=Bruce W.|title=Eruptive history of the early to mid miocene Waitakere volcanic arc, and palaeogeography of the Waitemata Basin, Northern New Zealand|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand|volume=9|issue=3|year=1979|pages=297–320|issn=0303-6758|doi=10.1080/03036758.1979.10419410}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lahars]] produced the coarser Parnell Grit. Notable visible volcanoes in the Waikato include [[Karioi]] and [[Pirongia]] (2.5 Ma). The volcanoes off the West coast of the North Island, together with Taranaki and the Tongariro Volcanic Centre, are responsible for the black iron sand on many of the beaches between Taranaki and [[Auckland]].

Shortly after (18 Ma), a volcanic arc developed further east to create the [[Coromandel Range]]s and undersea [[Colville Ridge]].  The initial activity was andesitic but later became rhyolitic (12 Ma).  In the [[Kauaeranga Valley]],  [[volcanic plugs]] remain, as does a lava lake that now forms the top of [[Table Mountain (New Zealand)|Table Mountain]].  Active [[geothermal systems]], similar to those that now exist near [[Rotorua]], were present around 6 Ma, and produced the [[gold]] and [[silver]] deposits that were later [[Mining|mine]]d in the [[Coromandel gold rush]].  Later (5–2 Ma), volcanic activity moved further south to form the [[Kaimai Range]].

===Active volcanoes and geothermal areas===

After this, activity shifted further East to the Taupo Volcanic Zone, which runs from the [[Tongariro Volcanic Centre]] ([[Mount Ruapehu|Ruapehu]] and [[Tongariro]]), through [[Taupo]], [[Rotorua]], and out to sea to form the Kermadec Ridge.  Activity was initiated around 2 Ma, and continues to this day.  The Tongariro Volcanic Centre is composed of andesitic volcanoes, while the areas around Taupo and Rotorua are largely rhyolitic with minor basalt. Early eruptions between Taupo and Rotorua around 1.25 Ma, and 1 Ma, were large enough to produce an [[ignimbrite]] sheet that reached [[Auckland]], [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]], and [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]]. This includes vast [[pumice]] deposits generated from eruptions in the Taupo Volcanic Zone occur throughout the central North Island, Bay of Plenty, [[Waikato]], [[King Country]] and [[Wanganui]] regions. Every so often, there are swarms of [[earthquakes]] within an area of the Taupo Volcanic Zone, which last for years.  These earthquake swarms indicate that some movement of [[magma]] is occurring below the surface.  While they have not resulted in an eruption in recent times, there is always the potential for a new volcano to be created, or a dormant volcano to come to life.

[[File:1 White Island.jpg|thumb|left|Eruption of [[Whakaari / White Island|White Island]], New Zealand's most active volcano,[[Bay of Plenty]].]]

The Tongariro Volcanic Centre developed over the last 275,000 years and contains the active andesitic volcanic cones of Ruapehu, Tongariro, and [[Ngauruhoe]] (really a side cone of Tongariro).  Ruapehu erupts about once a decade, and while the eruptions cause havoc for skiers, plane flights and hydroelectric dams, the eruptions are relatively minor.  However, the sudden collapse of the crater wall caused major problems when it generated a [[lahar]] in 1953, that destroyed a rail bridge, and caused 151 deaths at [[Tangiwai]].  The last significant eruption was 1995–96.  Ngauruhoe last erupted 1973–75. Taranaki is a perfectly formed andesitic strato-volcano, that last erupted in 1755.

[[Lake Taupo]], the largest lake in the North Island, is a [[volcanic caldera]], responsible for rhyolitic eruptions about once every 1,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Taupo – Eruptive History |url=http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=0401-07=&amp;volpage=erupt | work = Global Volcanism Program | publisher = [[Smithsonian Institution]] |accessdate=2008-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest eruption in the last 65,000 years was the cataclysmic [[Oruanui Eruption]] 26,500 years ago, producing 530 cubic kilometres of magma.  The most recent eruption, around 233 AD was also a major event, the biggest eruption worldwide in the last 5,000 years.  The eruption caused a pyroclastic flow that devastated the land from [[Waiouru]] to [[Rotorua]] in 10 minutes.

The [[Okataina]] volcanic centre, to the East of Rotorua, is also responsible for major cataclysmic rhyolitic eruptions.  The last eruption, of [[Mount Tarawera|Tarawera]] and [[Lake Rotomahana]] in 1886, was a relatively minor eruption, which was  thought to have destroyed the famous [[Pink and White Terraces]], and covered much of the surrounding countryside in ash, killing over 100 people. In 2017 researchers rediscovered the locations of the Pink and White Terraces using a forgotten survey from 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bunn|first=Rex|last2=Nolden|first2=Sascha|date=2017-06-07|title=Forensic cartography with Hochstetter’s 1859 Pink and White Terraces survey: Te Otukapuarangi and Te Tarata|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03036758.2017.1329748|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–18|doi=10.1080/03036758.2017.1329748|issn=0303-6758}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bunn and Nolden|first=Rex and Sascha|date=December 2016|title=Te Tarata and Te Otukapuarangi: Reverse engineering Hochstetter’s Lake Rotomahana Survey to map the Pink and White Terrace locations|url=https://ojs.victoria.ac.nz/jnzs/article/view/3988/3555|journal=Journal of New Zealand Studies|volume=NS23|pages=37–53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many lakes around Rotorua are [[calderas]] from rhyolitic eruptions.  For example, [[Lake Rotorua]] erupted around 13,500 years ago.

A line of undersea volcanoes extends out along the [[Kermadec Ridge]]. [[Whakaari/White Island|White Island]], in the Bay of Plenty, represents the southern end of this chain and is a very active andesitic volcano, erupting with great frequency.  It has the potential to cause a tsunami in the Bay of Plenty, as does the dormant [[Mayor Island]] volcano.

The Taupo Volcanic Zone is known for its [[geothermal]] activity.  For example, Rotorua and the surrounding area have many areas with [[geysers]], [[silica terrace]]s, [[fumaroles]], [[mudpot|mud-pool]]s, [[hot springs]], etc.  Notable geothermal areas include [[Whakarewarewa]], [[Tikitere]], [[Waimangu Volcanic Rift Valley|Waimangu]], [[Waiotapu]], [[Craters of the Moon (geothermal site)|Craters of the Moon]] and [[Orakei Korako]].  Geothermal energy is used to generate electricity at [[Wairakei]], near [[Taupo]].  Hot pools abound throughout New Zealand. [[Geothermal energy]] is used to generate electricity in the Taupo Volcanic Zone.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Hall (2004) [http://www.med.govt.nz/upload/24445/geothermal.pdf Existing and Potential Geothermal Resource for Electricity Generation].

==Modern tectonic setting and earthquakes==

{{Main article|List of earthquakes in New Zealand}}

[[File:NZ faults.png|thumb|250px|Major [[active fault]] zones of New Zealand showing variation in displacement vector of [[Pacific Plate]] relative to [[Indo-Australian Plate|Australian Plate]] along the boundary]]
New Zealand is currently astride the convergent boundary between the Pacific and Australian Plates. Over time, the relative motion of the plates has altered and the current configuration is geologically recent. Currently the Pacific Plate is subducted beneath the Australian Plate from around [[Tonga]] in the north, through the [[Tonga Trench]], [[Kermadec Trench]], and [[Hikurangi Trough]] to the east of the [[North Island]] of New Zealand, down to [[Cook Strait]].  Through most of the [[South Island]], the plates slide past each other ([[Alpine Fault]]), with slight [[obduction]] of the Pacific Plate over the Australian Plate, forming [[Southern Alps]].  From [[Fiordland]] south, the Australian Plate subducts under the Pacific Plate forming the [[Puysegur Trench]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/Geology/GeologyOverview/1/ENZ-Resources/Standard/2/en#breadcrumbtop Diagram showing the Australian-Pacific Plate Boundary]&lt;/ref&gt; This configuration has lead to volcanism and extension in the North Island forming the Taupo Volcanic Zone and uplift in the South Island forming the Southern Alps. 

The Pacific Plate is colliding with the Australian Plate at a rate of about 40&amp;nbsp;mm/yr.&lt;ref name="DeMetsGordon1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeMets|first1=C.|last2=Gordon|first2=R.

The East Coast of the North Island is also rotating clockwise, relative to Northland, [[Auckland]] and [[Taranaki]], stretching the [[Bay of Plenty]], and producing the [[Hauraki Rift]] (Hauraki Plains and Hauraki Gulf) and Taupo Volcanic Zone. The East Coast of the South Island is sliding obliquely towards the Alpine Fault, relative to [[Westland District|Westland]], causing the Southern Alps to rise about 10&amp;nbsp;mm/yr (although they are also worn down at a similar rate).&lt;ref name="LittleCox2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Little|first1=Timothy A.|last2=Cox|first2=Simon|last3=Vry|first3=Julie K.|last4=Batt|first4=Geoffrey|year=2005|title=Variations in exhumation level and uplift rate along the obliqu-slip Alpine fault, central Southern Alps, New Zealand|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin|volume=117|issue=5|pages=707|doi=10.1130/B25500.1|issn=0016-7606}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hauraki Plains]], [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], Bay of Plenty, [[Marlborough Sounds]], and [[Christchurch]] are sinking.  The Marlborough Sounds are known for their sunken mountain ranges.  As [[Wellington]] rises, and Marlborough sinks, [[Cook Strait]] is being shifted further south. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/Geology/GeologyOverview/11/ENZ-Resources/Standard/3/en#breadcrumbtop New Zealand uplift and sinking] from Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt;

Great [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] is built up in the earth's crust due to the constant movement of the tectonic plates. This stress is released by [[earthquake|earthquakes]], which can occur on the plate boundary or on any of thousands of smaller faults throughout New Zealand. Because the Pacific Plate is subducting under the eastern side of the North Island, there are frequent deep earthquakes east of a line from the Bay of Plenty to Nelson (the approximate edge of the subducted plate), with the earthquakes being deeper to the west, and shallower to the east. Because the Australian Plate is subducting under the Pacific Plate in [[Fiordland]], there are frequent deep earthquakes near Fiordland, with the earthquakes being deeper to the east and shallower near the west. 

Shallow earthquakes are more widespread, occurring almost everywhere throughout New Zealand (especially the Bay of Plenty, [[East Cape]] to Marlborough, and Alpine Fault).  However, Northland, [[Waikato]], and [[Otago]] are relatively stable. [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] had been without a major earthquake in recorded history until the {{M|w}} 7.1 [[2010 Canterbury earthquake|Canterbury earthquake]] on 4 September 2010. The volcanic activity in the central North island also creates many shallow earthquakes.

==Paleoclimate of New Zealand==
{{See also|Climate change in New Zealand|}}
[[File:All palaeotemps.svg|thumb|right|600px|Global palaeotemperature graphs (compressed scale) note the warmer Eocene and Miocene in green and the [[Ice Age]] in blue.]]
Since Zealandia separated from Gondwana (80 mya) in the Cretaceous the climate has typically been far warmer than today. However, since the [[Quaternary glaciation]] (2.9 mya) Zealandia has experienced climate either cooler or only slightly warmer than today. 

In the Cretaceous, New Zealand was positioned at 80 degrees south at the boundary between Antarctica and Australia. But it was covered in trees as the climate of 90 million years ago was much warmer and wetter than today.&lt;ref name="McGloneBuitenwerf2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGlone|first1=MS|last2=Buitenwerf|first2=R|last3=Richardson|first3=SJ|title=The formation of the oceanic temperate forests of New Zealand|journal=New Zealand Journal of Botany|volume=54|issue=2|year=2016|pages=128–155|issn=0028-825X|doi=10.1080/0028825X.2016.1158196}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the warm Eocene Period vast swamps covered New Zealand which became coal seams in Southland and [[Waikato]].

Over the past 30,000 years three major climate events are recorded in New Zealand, the [[last glacial maximum|last glacial maximum's]] coldest period from 28-18,000 years ago, a transitional period from 18-11,000 years ago and the Holocene Inter Glacial which has been occurring for the past 11,000 years.&lt;ref name="AllowayLowe2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alloway|first1=Brent V.|last2=Lowe|first2=David J.|last3=Barrell|first3=David J.

The study of New Zealand's paleoclimate has settled some of the debate regarding links between the [[Little Ice Age]] (LIA) in the Northern Hemisphere and the climate in New Zealand at the same time. The key facts to emerge are that New Zealand did experience a noticeable cooler climate, but at a slightly later date than in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. &lt;ref name="NIWA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.niwa.co.nz/our-science/climate/information-and-resources/clivar/pastclimate|title=Past climate variations over New Zealand|author=David Wratt|author2=Jim Salinger|author3=Rob Bell|author4=Drew Lorrey|author5=Brett Mullan|last-author-amp=yes|publisher=NIWA|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geological hazards==
[[File:Christchurch Earthquake 220211.jpg|thumb|right|Earthquake damage in Christchurch (2011).]]

New Zealand suffers from many natural hazards, including [[earthquakes]] and [[tsunamis]], volcanic and hydrothermal eruptions and [[landslides]].

The largest earthquake in New Zealand was an M8.2 event in the [[Wairarapa]], in 1855,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gns.cri.nz/Home/Learning/Science-Topics/Earthquakes/New-Zealand-Earthquakes/Where-were-NZs-largest-earthquakes|title=Where were NZs largest earthquakes? / New Zealand Earthquakes / Earthquakes / Science Topics / Learning / Home - GNS Science|last=Science|first=GNS|website=www.gns.cri.nz|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most deaths (261) occurred in a M7.8 earthquake in [[Hawkes Bay]] in 1931.  Widespread property damage was caused by the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake]], which measured 7.1; The M6.3 aftershock of 22 February 2011 ([[2011 Canterbury earthquake]]) resulted in 185 fatalities.  Most recently, the M7.8 [[2016 Kaikoura earthquake|Kaikoura earthquake]] struck just after midnight on November 14, 2016, killing two people in the remote Kaikoura area northeast of Christchurch  Numerous aftershocks of M5.0 or greater are spread over a large area between Wellington and Culverden.

New Zealand is at risk from tsunamis that are generated from both local and international faults. The eastern coast of New Zealand is most at risk as the [[Pacific Ocean]] is more tectonically active than the [[Tasman Sea]]. Locally the faults along the North Islands east coast provide the greatest risk. Minor tsunamis have occurred in New Zealand from earthquakes in Chile, Alaska and Japan.

There are many potentially dangerous volcanoes in the Taupo Volcanic Zone. The most severe volcanic eruption since the arrival of Europeans is the [[Mount Tarawera|Tarawera]] eruption in 1886. A [[lahar]] from  Mount Ruapehu [[Tangiwai disaster|derailed a train]] in 1955 killing 151 people.  Even a minor eruption at Ruapehu could cause the loss of electricity for Auckland, due to ash on the power lines, and in the [[Waikato River]] (stopping the generation of hydroelectric power).

Many parts of New Zealand are susceptible to landslides, particaly due to deforestaion and the high earthquake risk. Much of the North Island is steep, and composed of soft mudstone known as papa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/rock-and-mineral-names/1 |title=Rock and mineral names – Local names |first=Simon |last=Nathan |date=2 March 2009 |work=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that easily generates landslides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/rock-and-mineral-names/1/5 |title=Rock and mineral names |first=Simon |last=Nathan |date=24 September 2011 |work=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The history of New Zealand geology==
[[Image:AucklandMapHochstetter1859.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Hochstetter's map of the [[Auckland volcanic field]] (1859).]]
The detailed study of New Zealand's geology began with [[Julius von Haast]] and [[Ferdinand von Hochstetter]] who created numerous regional [[geological map]]s of the country during resource exploration in the mid-late 1800's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/287/1/375.abstract Johnston, M. R.; ''Nineteenth-century observations of the Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt, Nelson, New Zealand and trans-Tasman correlations,'' Geological Society, London, Special Publications 2007, v. 287, p. 375-387]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865 [[James Hector]] was appointed to found the [[Geological Survey of New Zealand]]. [[Patrick Marshall]] coined the terms ''[[andesite line]]'' and ''[[ignimbrite]]'' in the early 1900's while working in the Taupo Volcanic Zone. [[Harold Wellman]] discovered the Alpine Fault and its 480 km offset in 1941. Even though Wellman proved that large block of land could move consid erable distances the New Zealand geological survey was largely a late adopter of plate tectonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=5oJPAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=new+zealand+geology&amp;dq=new+zealand+geology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiM8NDT-e3eAhVQFHIKHV66BsYQ6AEIPzAE|title=The Geology of New Zealand|last=Suggate|first=Richard Patrick|last2=Punga|first2=Martin Theodore Te|date=1978|publisher=E.C.

'''Below:''' Which of the three locations should be associated with the resulting photo?[[File:Nationalmuseum.jpg|300px]]]]
A '''geotagged photograph''' is a [[photograph]] which is associated with a geographical location by [[geotagging]]. Usually this is done by assigning at least a [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] to the image, and optionally altitude, compass bearing and other fields may also be included.

In theory, every part of a picture can be tied to a geographic location, but in the most typical application, only the position of the photographer is associated with the entire digital image. This has implications for search and retrieval. For example, photos of a mountain summit can be taken from different positions miles apart. To find all images of a particular summit in an image database, all photos taken within a reasonable distance must be considered. The point position of the photographer can in some cases include the [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]], the direction the camera was pointing, as well as the elevation and the [[Dilution of precision (GPS)|DOP]].

==Methods of geotagging photographs==
There are a few methods of geotagging photographs, either automatic or manual.  Automatic methods provide the easiest and most precise method of geotagging an image, providing that a good signal has been acquired at the time of taking the photo.

===Automatic using a built-in GPS===
Several manufacturers offer cameras with a built-in GPS receiver, but most cameras with this capability are [[camera phone]]s as camera manufacturers after initial experience in the market came to treat GPS cameras as a [[niche market]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/why-dont-more-cameras-offer-gps/ New York Times Gadgetwise 2010/07/28] Why don't more cameras offer GPS?&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2008 Nikon P6000, for example, an early geotagging camera, was replaced in 2010 by the P7000 which lacked that feature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crave.cnet.co.uk/digitalcameras/nikon-coolpix-p7000-nikon-says-no-to-gps-50000673/ CNET UK] Nikon says No to GPS&lt;/ref&gt;  Some models also include a compass to indicate the direction the camera was facing when the picture was taken.

* [[Fujifilm FinePix F550EXR]]
* [[Fujifilm FinePix F770EXR]]
* [[Nikon COOLPIX P330]]

* [[Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ10]]
* [[Sony Alpha 55]]V ([[DSLR]])
* [[Sony Alpha 65]]V ([[DSLR]])
* Some mobile phones with [[assisted GPS]] use the cell phone network to speed GPS [[Time to First Fix|acquisition time]]s.

===Automatic using a connected GPS===
[[File:Solmeta N2 auf Nikon D5000 Rueckansicht.JPG|thumb|Geotagger "Solmeta N2 Compass" + Nikon D5000]]
The [[Nikon D1#D1H and D1X|D1X and D1H]] that Nikon introduced in 2002 included a GPS interface.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nikonsupport.eu/europe/Download/Other%20Downloads/gps_instructions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the first special GPS receiver for Nikon was produced by [[Dawntech]].&lt;ref&gt;http://gps-camera.eu/wissen/29-hardware/202-die-anfaenge-unser-erstes-dawntech-di-gps.html&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009 Nikon has sold its own Geotagger GP-1. Canon uses the USB socket on the wireless file transmitter unit (WFT) as the GPS interface.

Some [[digital camera]]s and [[camera phone]]s support an external [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receiver connected by cable, or inserted into the memory card slot or flash shoe. The Samsung SH100 can connect using [[Wi-Fi]] to get position data from a GPS-enabled [[smartphone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CES: Samsung's SH100 Wi-Fi-enabled camera|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/156989/2011/01/samsung_sh100.html|publisher=MacWorld|date=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the relevant GPS data is automatically stored in the photo's [[Exchangeable image file format|Exif]] information when the photo is taken.  A connected GPS will generally remain switched on continuously, requiring power, and will then have location information available immediately when the camera is switched on.

Many GPS-ready cameras are currently available, made by manufacturers such as [[Nikon]], [[Fujifilm]], [[Sony]] and [[Panasonic]]. Automatic geotagging combined with real-time transfer and publishing results in [[real-time geotagging]].

===Synchronizing with a separate GPS===
Most cameras sold today do not contain a built-in GPS receiver; however, an external location-aware device, such as a hand-held [[GPS_tracking_unit#Data_loggers|GPS logger]], can still be used with a non-GPS digital camera for geotagging.  The photo is taken without geographical information and is processed later using software in conjunction with the GPS data.  [[Timestamp]]s made by the camera can be compared with timestamps in the recorded GPS information, provided that the clocks in the separate devices can be synchronized.  The resulting coordinates can then be added to the Exif information of the photo.

===Manual geotagging===
Location information can also be added to photos, for example via its [[Exif]] specification that has fields for longitude/latitude, even if no GPS device was present when the photo was taken.

The information can be entered by directly giving the coordinates or by selecting a location from a map using software tools.  Some tools allow entry of tags such as city, [[postal code]] or a street address.  [[Geocoding]] and [[reverse geocoding]] can be used to convert between locations and addresses.

Manual geotagging also introduces possibilities of error, where a photograph's location is incorrectly represented by wrong coordinates. An advanced comparative analysis of such photos with the total collection set of all photos available from the surrounding coordinates, needs to be done to single out and flag such photos, but such a software's value, need and purpose could be limited in today's environment where almost every smartphone and camera have geotagging built-in and users do not need to manually enter this information.

===Remote standoff capture===
[[File:Predator screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|Screenshot from a [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] [[General Atomics MQ-1 Predator|Predator UAV]], showing the GPS position of the aircraft (red) and the target (blue)]]
Some manufacturers of military and professional mapping-grade GPS instruments have integrated a GPS receiver with a [[laser rangefinder]] and [[digital camera]]. These multi-functional tools are able to determine a remote subject's GPS position by calculating the subject's geographic location relative to the camera's GPS position.  These instruments are commonly used in military applications when an aircraft or operator is targeting an area, the position is inaccessible (for example over a valley or wetland), there are personal health &amp; safety concerns (motorway traffic), or the user wants to quickly capture multiple targets from a single, safe position (trees, street signage and furniture).

Civilian integrated GPS cameras with rangefinders and remote standoff capability are currently available made by manufacturers such as Ricoh and Surveylab.

==Uses==
When geotagged photos are uploaded to online sharing communities such as [[Flickr]], [[Panoramio]] or [[Moblog]], the photo can be placed onto a map to view the location the photo was taken.  In this way, users can browse photos from a map, search for photos from a given area, and find related photos of the same place from other users.

Many [[smartphone]]s automatically geotag their photos by default. Photographers who prefer not to reveal their location can turn this feature off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nv.ngb.army.mil/Army%20Geotagging%20Safety.pdf US Army] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217152857/http://www.nv.ngb.army.mil/Army%20Geotagging%20Safety.pdf |date=2010-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally smartphones can use their GPS to geotag photos taken with an external camera.

[[File:GPS_location_stamped_with_GPStamper.jpg#file|thumb|Geotagged photo location stamped with GPStamper]]
Geotagged photos may be visually stamped with their GPS location information using software tools.  A stamped photo affords universal and cross-platform viewing of the photo's location, and offers the security of retaining that location information in the event of metadata corruption, or if file metadata is stripped from a photo, e.g. when uploading to various online photo sharing communities.

Geotagging is also being used to determine social patterns. For example, Now app uses geotagged Instagram photos to find nearby events happening now.&lt;ref&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/11/now-app/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Batura valley Passu.jpg|right|thumb|[[Muchu Chhish]] at far left is the tallest peak on earth that is not off limits to climbers that remains still unclimbed as of 2018.]]
An '''unclimbed mountain''' is a mountain peak that has yet to be climbed to the top. Determining which unclimbed peak is highest is often a matter of controversy. In some parts of the world, surveying and mapping are still unreliable, and there are no comprehensive records of the routes of explorers, mountaineers and local inhabitants. In some cases, even modern ascents by larger parties have been poorly documented and, with no universally recognized listing, the best that can be achieved in determining the world's highest unclimbed peaks is somewhat speculative. Most sources indicate that [[Gangkhar Puensum]] ({{convert|7570|m|ft}}) in [[Bhutan]] or on the Bhutan-[[China]] border is the tallest mountain in the world that has yet to be fully summited. Gangkhar Puensum has been off limits to climbers since 1994 when Bhutan prohibited all mountaineering above {{convert|6000|m|ft|abbr=on}} due to spiritual/religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=nuwer&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nuwer|first1=Rachel|title=The mountains we have never climbed|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140703-the-last-mountains-to-climb|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 February 2018|date=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unclimbed mountains are sometimes referred to as "virgin peaks". Many virgin peaks exist because the mountain is unreachable, due to either geographic isolation or political instability. Some mountains remain off limits due to religious beliefs of a country or region that hold such mountains are sacred and should remain inviolate. Additionally, since the endeavor to scale taller mountains of the world is usually a major undertaking, lesser peaks, while still very formidable, simply get less attention than the taller ones, and instead these taller peaks are summited by parties following a new route or perhaps during the winter when conditions are generally more treacherous.&lt;ref name=nuwer/&gt;

==Challenges in definition==
===Definition of a mountain===
[[File:prominence_definition.svg|right|thumb|250px|Figure 1. Vertical arrows show the topographic prominence of three peaks on an island. The dashed horizontal lines show the lowest contours that do not encircle higher peaks. Curved arrows point from a peak to its parent.]]
Many mountains, in addition to their highest point or peak, will also have subsidiary subpeaks. Generally, the [[topographic prominence]] of a peak or subpeak, as well as the general topography, all come into consideration when determining whether such apexes are considered to be independent peaks or subpeaks. Although objective criteria have been proposed for distinguishing peaks from subpeaks, there is no widely agreed standard. In 1994, the [[International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation]] (UIAA) classified 82 mountain peaks in the [[Alps]] whose summits were at least {{convert|4000|m|abbr=on}} above sea level and with at least {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} of topographic prominence over any adjacent [[mountain pass]] or [[col]], as a distinct peak.&lt;ref name="uiaa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mountain Classification|url=http://www.theuiaa.org/mountaineering/mountain-classification/|publisher=UIAA-International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verification of unclimbed status===
It can be difficult sometimes to determine whether or not a mountain peak has been fully summited. Long before modern mountaineering commenced in the middle of the 19th century, evidence indicates that people did indeed travel up to the summits or near to the summits of major mountain peaks. Archaeological excavations in the [[Andes]] have shown that humans travelled up to {{convert|6739|m|ft|abbr=on}} in pre-historic times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reinhard|first1=Johan|last2=Ceruti|first2=Constanza|title=Inca Rituals and Sacred Mountains: A Study of the World's Highest Archaeological Sites|date=2010|publisher=Institute of Archaeology Press|isbn=9781931745765}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent settlements as high as {{convert|4500|m|abbr=on}} were established as long as 12,000&amp;nbsp;years ago in the Andes as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ghose|first1=Tia|title=Oldest High-Altitude Human Settlement Discovered in Andes|url=https://www.livescience.com/48419-high-altitude-setllement-peru.html|publisher=Live Science|accessdate=14 March 2018|date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Greater Himalaya region, [[Lhasa (prefecture-level city)|Lhasa]], in Tibet, sitting at {{convert|3650|m|abbr=on}} has been permanently occupied since the 7th century and many smaller settlements across the Greater Himalaya thrive at elevations exceeding {{convert|4000|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gill|first1=Nicholas|title=Where are the world's highest cities?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/feb/08/where-world-highest-cities-altitude|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=14 March 2018|date=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With humans living at high elevations for many millennia, nearby peaks to such settlements may or may not have been summited at some point in the past. However, many regions away from settlements may have never before been explored, especially since some high peaks in the [[Greater Ranges]] are so remote that they were unknown to local inhabitants when first sighted by European explorers.

The worlds third tallest peak, [[Kangchenjunga]], has been summited a number of times, but after the first climbers of the peak agreed to honor the wishes of locals and not set foot on the topmost part of the mountain, succeeding mountaineering parties may have followed this tradition. Similarly, [[Nanda Devi]] has also been climbed but the topmost summit was not ascended and the primary summit is now off limits to climbers. [[Machapuchare]] had only one summit attempt back in 1957 when climbers came within {{convert|150|m|abbr=on}} of the summit; Nepal then banned future attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Four Forbidden Mountains in the Himalayas|url=http://climbreport.net/4-forbidden-mountains-in-the-himalayas/|publisher=Climb Report|accessdate=16 March 2018|date=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gangkhar Puensum==
[[File:Gangkhar puensum summit.JPG|thumb|Summit of [[Gangkhar Puensum]] from Gophu La pass, [[Bhutan]]]]
The mountain most widely claimed to be the highest unclimbed mountain in the world in terms of [[elevation]] is [[Gangkhar Puensum]] ({{convert|7570|m|ft|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref name="TI_2001"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tsuguyasu Itami|title=Gankarpunzum &amp; First Ascent Of Liankang Kangri|journal=Japanese Alpine News|date=October 2001|volume=1|url=http://www.jac.or.jp/english/jan/vol1/GANKARPUNZUM.pdf|accessdate=14 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in [[Bhutan]], on or near the border with [[People's Republic of China|China]]. In Bhutan, the climbing of mountains higher than {{convert|6000|m|ft|abbr=on}} has been prohibited since 1994. The rationale for this prohibition is based on local customs that consider this and similar peaks to be the sacred homes of protective deities and spirits, and the lack of high-altitude rescue resources from any locale closer than [[India]]. The prohibition was further expanded in 2003 when mountaineering of any kind was disallowed entirely within Bhutan. Gangkhar Puensum will likely remain unclimbed so long as the government of Bhutan prohibits it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jennings|first1=Ken|title=What's The World's Highest Mountain That's Never Been Climbed|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2015-12-14/whats-the-worlds-highest-mountain-thats-never-been-climbed|publisher=Conde Nast|accessdate=14 March 2018|date=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Highest unclimbed non-prohibited peak==
[[File:Kabru2.jpg|left|thumb|A secondary summit of Kabru is one of the tallest that still remain unclimbed]]
It is unclear which is the highest unclimbed non-prohibited mountain. While some recognize only peaks with {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} of topographical prominence as individual summits, the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation uses a {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} as the cutoff for determining individual summits. Based on the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation's criteria, [[Muchu Chhish]] ({{convert|7452|m|ft|abbr=on}} with a prominence of {{convert|263|m|ft|abbr=on}}) in Pakistan is currently the world's tallest that has not been climbed even though it is legal to do so. Other unclimbed summits include one on the massif known as [[Kabru]] ({{convert|7318|m|abbr=on}} prominence c. {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}}), [[Labuche Kang III/East]] ({{convert|7250|m|ft|abbr=on}}) with prominence of {{convert|570|m|abbr=on}} and [[Karjiang]] ({{convert|7221|m|ft|abbr=on}} with a prominence of {{convert|895|m|ft|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref name="newcomb"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newcomb|first1=Tim|title=7 of the Tallest Unclimbed Mountains in the World|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/adventure/outdoors/g13537785/7-of-the-tallest-unclimbed-mountains-in-the-world/|publisher=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=14 March 2018|date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==Most prominent unclimbed peak==
Unclimbed candidates with high [[topographic prominence]] are by definition independent mountains, but some have relatively modest elevations. With such peaks there is a greater possibility of undocumented ascents, perhaps occurring long ago.

[[Sauyr Zhotasy]] ({{convert|3840|m|ft|abbr=on}}, prominence of {{convert|3252|m|ft|abbr=on}}), the highpoint in the [[Saur Mountains|Saur Range]] on the border between [[Kazakhstan]] and [[China]], and [[Mount Siple]] ({{convert|3110|m|ft|abbr=on}}, prominence of {{convert|3110|m|ft|abbr=on}}) on [[Siple Island]] off the coast of [[Antarctica]], have no record of successful ascents, but the unclimbed status of each of these peaks is difficult to confirm.&lt;ref name=newcomb/&gt;

'''''Ley''''' (''the Ley'', plural: the ''Leyen'') is an old German word for [[rock (geology)|rock]], [[cliff]] or [[crag (climbing)|crag]] which often occurs in placenames.

== Etymology ==
''Ley'', also ''lay'', ''lei'', ''lai'', ''laige''&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Woeste: ''Wörterbuch der westfälischen Mundart''. Leipzig, 1882, p. 155 ([http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb11023641_00001.html online])&lt;/ref&gt; or ''lägge'',&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard Pilkmann-Pohl: ''Plattdeutsches Wörterbuch des kurkölnischen Sauerlandes.'' Strobel-Verlag, Arnsberg 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; and, accourding to Grimm, ''leie'', is a commonly occurring name for rocks or crags in the [[Rhenish]] and [[Lower German]] language regions. It is derived from the [[Old Saxon]] word, ''lêia''. It is particularly associated with rock precipices (''Felsabbrüche'') and rock faces (''Felswände''), but also with rock slabs (''Felsplatte''). In addition, it is also used in the sense of [[shale]] or [[slate]] ''(Leienstein)'', and also to mean "slate" in the sense of a blackboard or roofing tile ''([[Leyendecker|Leiendecker]])''. Its [[Dutch language|Dutch]] form is ''leyde'' or ''leye''.&lt;ref name="Grimm-Leie"&gt; Eintrag [http://woerterbuchnetz.de/DWB/wbgui_py?lemid=GL04319 LEIE,LEI, f. fels, stein.] In: Jacob Grimm, Wilhelm Grimm: ''[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]''. Leipzig 1854-1960 (dwb.uni-trier.de)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Celtologists at the [[University of Trier]] the term may have originally come from the Gallic ([[Celtic languages|Celtic]]) word, ''lika, likka'' which means "rock slab/sheet''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uni-trier.de/index.php?id=37329 Forum Keltic Studies zu Lei]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In addition to natural rock walls, an artificial [[quarry]], such as the basalt quarries of the [[Eifel]], may be called a ''Ley'' or ''Lay''. The workers there are known as ''Layer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vulkanschule: Die Museumslay|periodical=|publisher=Vulkanpark, Nationaler Geopark Vulkanland Eifel|url=http://vulkanschule.de/service/vulkanpark-stationen/museumslay|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2015-05-26|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a ''partial'' or ''incomplete'' list of places in countries other than [[Ireland]] named after places in Ireland.

Massive emigration, often called the [[Irish diaspora]], from Ireland in the 19th and 20th centuries resulted in many towns and regions being named or renamed after places in Ireland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28291">The [[landscape architecture]] firm of [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], and later of his sons [[John Charles Olmsted]] and [[Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.]] (known as the [[Olmsted Brothers]]), produced designs and plans for hundreds of parks, campuses and other projects throughout the United States and Canada. This is an non-exhaustive list of those projects.

==Frederick Law Olmsted Sr.==
===Academic campuses===
Olmsted designed numerous school and college campuses between 1857 and 1895.

From 1895 to 1950, the [[Olmsted Brothers]] (his successors) added to some of their father's initial projects, as well as designing new ones. (See {{section link||Olmsted Brothers}} for those projects.) Together, these works totaled 355. Some of the most famous of Frederick Law Olmsted Sr. are listed here.

There are three airports operating in [[Antigua and Barbuda]], a nation lying between the [[Caribbean Sea]] and the Atlantic Ocean. Antigua and Barbuda consists of two major inhabited islands, [[Antigua]] and [[Barbuda]], and a number of smaller islands (including Great Bird, Green, Guinea, Long, Maiden and York Islands). Separated by a few nautical miles, the group is in the middle of the [[Leeward Islands]], part of the [[Lesser Antilles]].

A '''national mapping agency''' is an organisation, usually publicly owned, that produces [[topographic map]]s and [[geographic data|geographic information]] of a country. Some national mapping agencies also deal with [[cadastre|cadastral]] matters.

==History==

===Ordnance Survey===

The first national mapping agency was the [[Ordnance Survey]] in the United Kingdom;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geospatial.blogs.com/geospatial/2012/07/ordnance-survey-forms-os-international.html|title=Ordnance Survey forms OS International to offer national mapping assistance internationally|access-date=2013-12-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111140/http://geospatial.blogs.com/geospatial/2012/07/ordnance-survey-forms-os-international.html|archive-date=2013-12-24|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.charlesclosesociety.org/files/Issue96page14.pdf|title=Ordnance Survey maps that changed the world|author=Nina Morgan|access-date=2013-12-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224090821/http://www.charlesclosesociety.org/files/Issue96page14.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-24|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; its roots go back to 1747, when the compilation of a map of the [[Scottish Highlands]] was proposed.&lt;ref&gt;By Lieutenant-Colonel David Watson to facilitate the subjugation of the clans following the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Porter|first=Whitworth|authorlink=Whitworth Porter|year=1889|title=History of the Corps of Royal Engineers|volume=I|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co|publication-place=London|pages=167–68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqlBAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=2008-08-14|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This survey at a scale of 1&amp;nbsp;inch to 1000 yards (1:36,000)&lt;ref name=MFH114&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maps for Historians |last=Hindle |first=Paul |year=1998 |publisher=Phillimore &amp; Co |isbn=0-85033-934-0 |pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the starting point of the [[Principal Triangulation of Great Britain]] (1783–1853), and led to the creation of the Ordnance Survey itself; work was begun in earnest in 1790, when the [[Board of Ordnance]] began a national military survey at one-[[inch]]-to-the-[[mile]] (1:63,360 scale).&lt;ref name=MFH117&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maps for Historians |last=Hindle |first=Paul |year=1998 |publisher=Phillimore &amp; Co |isbn=0-85033-934-0 |pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the next thirty years, roughly a third of England and Wales was mapped (see [[Principal Triangulation of Great Britain]]), as other military matters took precedence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of the Ordnance Survey|editor-last=Seymour|editor-first=W.A.|year=1980|publisher=Folkestone: Wm Dawson &amp; Sons|page=71|url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/docs/ebooks/a-history-of-the-ordnance-survey/index.html|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

'''Okpofe''' is an autonomous community located in Ezinihitte Mbaise LGA, [[Imo State]], [[Nigeria]] with common boundaries with Itu, Ezeagbogu, Ihitte and Amumara autonomous communities.Okpofe is the very centre of Ezinihitte Mbaise Clan. It is the only town in Ezinihitte Mbaise that does not share a boundary with another local government area in Imo State. It is quite a unique town in Ezinihitte. Most of the general activities of Ezinihitte people hold in Okpofe due to its Central position. It is also on record that the Roman Catholic Church first established in Okpofe town in the whole of Ezinihitte Mbaise(by 2018, the town will be marking the centenary celebration of the existence of the Roman Catholic Church in Okpofe.) The Anglican Juniorate in Mbaise is located in Okpofe.
   Okpofe Town is a very peaceful community in Ezinihitte Mbaise. Its first traditional ruler was Late Eze Ewulonu Modestus C. Anyanka, an amiable, handsome young man who ascended the throne at the age of 42, born by an Umuimee daughter to an Okwu man. He joined his ancestors in 2005 after leading the town to an enviable height. Today, the traditional affairs of the town are under the care of His Royal Highness Eze Sir Reginald Jesse Chukwuma Aguwamba, a gentleman that is being described as "the man of the people" and whose uncle was the last warrant chief that also crowned the Late Eze Anyanka in the late 70's. Eze Reginald Aguwamba was born by an Umuimee man. (Take note of the importance of this village Umuimee in the history of Ezeship in Okpofe). A surveyor by profession, Eze Aguwamba retired voluntarily from the Owerri Capital Development Authority to serve his fatherland as the Eze Oha II. He has so far lead the community to an enviable position in the Oji Ezinihitte Festival that no other community in the clan has attained during the 2013 Oji Festival at Okpofe and the recently concluded one at Ezeagbogu. Within his first few months in office, some other developmental projects from the Imo State Government came into Okpofe. This is the sign of a good choice of traditional ruler!

The story of Okpofe cannot be complete any day without mention to Late Sydney Ngozi Njoku. He almost single-handedly financed the building of Okpofe Secondary School, Okpofe Town Hall, The Okpofe Post Office. He undertook and concluded several human and structural developmental projects in Okpofe, Ezinihitte and Imo State at large. Singoz as he was popularly called died in 1983 at a very youthful age of 42 years.

'''Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1''' is a commercial [[spaceport]] located close to [[Ahuriri Point]] at the southern tip of [[Mahia Peninsula]], on the east coast of [[New Zealand]]'s [[North Island]]. It is owned and operated by [[private spaceflight]] company [[Rocket Lab]] and will support launches of the company's [[Electron (rocket)|Electron]] rocket for [[CubeSat]] nanosatellites. The facility officially opened on 26 September 2016 ([[UTC]]).

== Description ==
Launch Complex 1 features a {{convert|50|t|adj=on}} launch platform and tower, a hangar for the Electron rockets, and storage tanks for [[liquid oxygen]] and [[kerosene]].&lt;ref name="latimes20160926"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-rocket-lab-20160926-snap-story.html |title=Rocket Lab finishes launch complex in New Zealand |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Samantha |last=Masunaga |date=26 September 2016 |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the test phase of launch operations, which began in May 2017,&lt;ref name="sfnow20170525" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roclab20161213"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rocketlab.co.nz/latest/rocket-lab-completes-final-major-technical-milestone-before-first-test-launches/ |title=Rocket Lab Completes Major Technical Milestone Ahead of Test Launches |publisher=Rocket Lab |date=13 December 2016 |accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[exclusion zone]] would likely be an {{convert|8|km|mi|0|adj=on|spell=on}} radius from the pad, and would reduce in size once the site became commercially operational.&lt;ref name="nzherald20160927" /&gt;

== History ==
=== Site options ===
Rocket Lab announced on 1 July 2015 that it had selected [[Kaitorete Spit]] in New Zealand's [[South Island]] near [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] as the site of the launch facility for its [[Electron (rocket)|Electron]] rocket, and that it hoped to have construction finished by the end of the year. While the site would not permit equatorial launches due to the presence of [[Banks Peninsula]] to the east, it was favourable for [[Sun-synchronous orbit]]al flights, which the company believed would be of primary interest to its customers. The site was also logistically favourable as the company wanted to build a rocket production facility in nearby [[Christchurch]].&lt;ref name="spacenews20150601"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spacenews.com/rocket-lab-selects-new-zealand-launch-site/ |title=Rocket Lab Selects New Zealand Launch Site |work=SpaceNews |first=Jeff |last=Foust |date=1 July 2015 |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mahia Peninsula]] site at Onenui Station was mentioned in August 2015 as a possible second launch facility.&lt;ref name="gisborne20150820"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gisborneherald.co.nz/localnews/1900032-135/wairoa-gateway-to-the-galaxy |title='Wairoa - Gateway to the Galaxy' |work=The Gisborne Herald |date=20 August 2015 |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had first been visited by company officials in April 2015 as part of their initial scouting for launch sites,&lt;ref name="gisborne20151014"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gisborneherald.co.nz/localnews/1972121-135/rocket-lab-planning-all-go-at |title=Rocket Lab planning all go at Mahia |work=Wairoa Star ''via'' The Gisborne Herald |first=Suzi |last=Lewis |date=14 October 2015 |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were preparing to submit a [[resource consent]] application.&lt;ref name="gisborne20150820" /&gt; By mid-October, the application had been approved by the [[Wairoa]] District Council and [[Hawke's Bay Region|Hawke's Bay]] Regional Council only seven days after its submission,&lt;ref name="gisborne20151014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nzherald20160628"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11664807 |title=All set for lift off on Mahia Peninsula |work=Hawke's Bay Today ''via'' New Zealand Herald |first=Victoria |last=White |date=28 June 2016 |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]] Chamber of Commerce and the Eastland Community Trust working with Rocket Lab to support its bid for the Mahia site.&lt;ref name="gisborne20151124"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gisborneherald.co.nz/localnews/2028761-135/rocket-lab-chooses-mahia-for-space |title=Rocket Lab chooses Mahia for space launches |work=The Gisborne Herald |first1=Debbie |last1=Gregory |first2=Andrew |last2=Ashton |date=24 November 2015 |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decision for Mahia ===
On 23 November 2015, Rocket Lab stated that the Mahia Peninsula site would be the priority launch facility because of delays in [[Regulatory agency|obtaining resource consents for developing]] at Kaitorete Spit.&lt;ref name="gisborne20151124" /&gt;

While certain authorisations had been obtained for Kaitorete, such as stormwater and air discharge permits from Environment Canterbury, a coastal permit for occupation of the area, and a Department of Conservation permit, the Christchurch City Council had not consented to the development due to an incomplete Cultural Impact Assessment, resulting in no action under Sections 95 and 104 of the [[Resource Management Act 1991]].&lt;ref name="stuff20151122"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/73935090/Kaitorete-Spit-on-the-back-burner-for-Rocket-Lab-launch |title=Canty's Birdlings Flat on the back burner for Rocket Lab launch |website=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |first=Martin |last=Van Beynen |date=22 November 2015 |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company said that efforts would continue to gain consent for a launch pad on Kaitorete Spit due to its logistical superiority and the foreseen need for additional facilities, but that the Mahia site offered superior launch corridor and flight rate opportunities because of its geographical location and relatively sparse air traffic. The Mahia site is licensed for a maximum launch rate of once every 72 hours over a period of 30 years—Rocket Lab believes the actual rate would average once per week—while the Kaitorete site would only have been licensed to launch once per month.&lt;ref name="stuff20151122" /&gt;&lt;ref name="space20160926"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/34195-rocket-lab-opens-private-launch-site-new-zealand.html |title=Rocket Lab Opens Private Orbital Launch Site in New Zealand |work=Space.com |first=Calla |last=Cofield |date=26 September 2016 |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company broke ground at Mahia in December 2015, and by June 2016 most of the infrastructure work had been completed, including upgrades to roads and internet services, and work was progressing on the electrical, mechanical and communications infrastructure.&lt;ref name="nzherald20160628" /&gt; Rocket Lab signed an agreement with [[air traffic service]] provider [[Airways New Zealand]] in early September 2016 to develop "special use airspace" and ensure regular flight activity, which the company estimates could be up to 100 launches per year.&lt;ref name="stuff20160909"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/84057531/Airways-hopes-Rocket-Lab-launch-will-be-first-of-many |title=Airways hopes Rocket Lab launch will be 'first of many' |website=Stuff.co.nz |first=Hamish |last=McNicol |date=9 September 2016 |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mahia Peninsula site, named Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1, was officially opened on 26 September 2016 ([[UTC]]) in a ceremony presided over by [[Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment|Minister for Economic Development]] [[Steven Joyce]]. It was attended by approximately 240 people, including company employees, local landowners, and [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] leader [[Andrew Little (New Zealand politician)|Andrew Little]].&lt;ref name="nzherald20160927"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11717676 |title=Rocket launch site officially opened |work=Hawke's Bay Today ''via'' New Zealand Herald |first=Victoria |last=White |date=27 September 2016 |accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spaceflightinsider-20160930 /&gt;

'''Sociedad Mexicana de Geografía y Estadística''' ('''Mexican Society for Geography and Statistics''') is a national organization founded on 18 April 1833 to promote the mapping and boundary demarcation of the [[History of Mexico#First Republic|newly independent Mexican state]]. The aim of its founders was to aid a number of governmental agencies and through the efforts of liberal head of state, [[Valentín Gómez Farías]]. It was the first geographical society in the Americas and the fourth in the world.

From the beginning, the scope of projects was very broad, covering not only the physiography of the territory but also its natural resources and their potential for development. Also included in their study was the nature of the population, its size, age distribution, ethnic and linguistic makeup. One of the first publications was in 1850, the work of geographer Antonio García Cubas, followed by an atlas of the republic, started in 1841 and completed in 1850, but not published for several years due to lack of funds.

Among the achievements of the Society were:
* Initiatives within the Mexican government to issue laws providing a process for determining the official names of cities and towns.
* Promoted legislation for the care of forests and conservation of archaeological monuments as a national priority.
* Produced a report on the metric system, which allowed Mexico to be among the first countries in Latin America to adopt it.
* Proposed the laying out of a telegraph system for Mexico City.
* Sponsoring the publication of the ''Boletín de la Sociedad Mexicana de Geografía y Estadística'' (Bulletin of the Society) for the dissemination of all the reports and data that the Society accumulated.

Currently the Society contributes to the research, analysis and understanding of the major problems of Mexico through its 55 specialized academies and local societies involved in the various Mexican states.  This includes close ties with [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía]] (INEGI), and working with the various Mexican universities as well as with major [[United States|U.S.]] institutions.

[[Image:Geographic Southpole crop.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The Geographic South Pole is marked by the stake on the right.]]
[[Image:Antarctica 6400px from Blue Marble.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[NASA]] image showing Antarctica and the South Pole in 2005.]]
[[Image:Pole-south.gif|thumb|upright=1.4|{{ordered list |South Geographic Pole |[[South Magnetic Pole]] (2007) |[[South Geomagnetic Pole]] (2005) |[[Pole of Inaccessibility|South Pole of Inaccessibility]]}}]]

The '''South Pole''', also known as the '''Geographic South Pole''' or '''Terrestrial South Pole''', is one of the two points where the [[Earth's rotation|Earth's axis of rotation]] intersects its surface. It is the southernmost point on the surface of the [[Earth]] and lies on the opposite side of the Earth from the [[North Pole]].

Situated on the continent of [[Antarctica]], it is the site of the [[United States]] [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]], which was established in 1956 and has been permanently staffed since that year. The Geographic South Pole is distinct from the [[South Magnetic Pole]], the position of which is defined based on the Earth's magnetic field. The South Pole is at the center of the [[Southern Hemisphere]].

==Geography==
[[Image:Ceremonial South Pole.jpg|thumb|The Ceremonial South Pole in 1998.]]
[[Image:Amundsen-scott-south pole station 2007.jpg|thumb|The Ceremonial South Pole as of February 2008.]]
For most purposes, the Geographic South Pole is defined as the southern point of the two points where the Earth's [[axis of rotation]] intersects its surface (the other being the [[North Pole|Geographic North Pole]]). However, the Earth's axis of rotation is actually subject to very small "wobbles" ([[polar motion]]), so this definition is not adequate for very precise work.

The [[geographic coordinate]]s of the South Pole are usually given simply as 90°S, since its longitude is geometrically undefined and irrelevant. When a longitude is desired, it may be given as {{nowrap|0°.}} At the South Pole, all directions face north. For this reason, directions at the Pole are given relative to "grid north", which points northwards along the [[prime meridian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://quest.nasa.gov/antarctica/background/cara/movpole.html "Moving the South Pole"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716140440/http://quest.nasa.gov/antarctica/background/cara/movpole.html |date=2011-07-16 }}, NASA Quest&lt;/ref&gt; Along tight latitude circles, clockwise is east, and counterclockwise is west, opposite to the [[North Pole]].

The Geographic South Pole is located on the continent of [[Antarctica]] (although this has not been the case for all of [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] because of [[continental drift]]). It sits atop a featureless, barren, windswept and icy plateau at an altitude of 2,835 metres (9,301&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level, and is located about 1,300&amp;nbsp;km (800&amp;nbsp;mi) from the nearest open sea at [[Bay of Whales]]. The ice is estimated to be about 2,700 metres (9,000&amp;nbsp;ft) thick at the Pole, so the land surface under the [[ice sheet]] is actually near sea level.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/support/southp.jsp Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station], National Science Foundation, Office of Polar Programs&lt;/ref&gt;

The polar ice sheet is moving at a rate of roughly 10 metres per year in a direction between 37° and 40° west of grid north,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.southpolestation.com/pole/survey.html | title=Where is the real Pole really? | accessdate=2008-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; down towards the [[Weddell Sea]]. Therefore, the position of the station and other artificial features relative to the geographic pole gradually shift over time.

The Geographic South Pole is marked by a stake in the ice alongside a small sign; these are repositioned each year in a ceremony on [[New Year's Day]] to compensate for the movement of the ice.&lt;ref name=antarcticsun2006&gt;[http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/pastIssues/2005-2006/2006_01_08.pdf "Marker makes annual move"], page 6, Antarctic Sun. January 8, 2006; McMurdo Station, Antarctica.&lt;/ref&gt; The sign records the respective dates that [[Roald Amundsen]] and [[Robert Falcon Scott|Robert F. Scott]] reached the Pole, followed by a short quotation from each man, and gives the elevation as "9,301 ''FT.''"&lt;!-- Please do not convert this number to metres. The sign gives the elevation in feet --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicalarchives.com/prs/astro/Antarctica/0640-Sign_at_the__moving__actual_geographical_South_Pole.jpg |title=Sign at the (ever moving) actual geographical South Pole (a few feet away from the Ceremonial Pole) |publisher=Pierre R.

===Ceremonial South Pole===
The Ceremonial South Pole is an area set aside for photo opportunities at the [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station|South Pole Station]]. It is located some meters from the Geographic South Pole, and consists of a metallic sphere on a short bamboo pole, surrounded by the flags of the original [[Antarctic Treaty]] signatory [[Sovereign state|states]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Historic monuments===

'''Amundsen's Tent''': The tent was erected by the Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen on its arrival on 14 December 1911. It is currently buried beneath the snow and ice in the vicinity of the Pole. It has been designated a [[Historic Sites and Monuments in Antarctica|Historic Site or Monument]] (HSM 80), following a proposal by Norway to the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting]].&lt;ref name=atcm&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ats.aq/documents/ATCM35/WW/atcm35_ww003_e.pdf|title= List of Historic Sites and Monuments approved by the ATCM (2012)|accessdate=2014-01-07 |publisher=Antarctic Treaty Secretariat |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise location of the tent is unknown, but based on calculations of the rate of movement of the ice and the accumulation of snow, it is believed, as of 2010, to lie between 1.8 and 2.5&amp;nbsp;km (1.1 and 1.6 miles) from the Pole at a depth of 17&amp;nbsp;m (56&amp;nbsp;ft) below the present surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=413DE249464BAEBDBF64B335F6B5C576.journals?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8295706] ''Polar Record'' / Volume 47 / Issue 03 / July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploration==
{{see also|History of Antarctica|List of Antarctic expeditions|Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration|Farthest South}}

===Pre-1900===
In 1820, several expeditions claimed to have been the first to have sighted Antarctica, with the very first{{clarify | reason = Very first what? Claim or sighting?|date=September 2016}} being the Russian expedition led by [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]] and [[Mikhail Lazarev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1971 |title=Bellingshausen and the discovery of Antarctica|journal=Polar Record |volume=15 |issue=99 |pages=887–889 |doi=10.1017/S0032247400062112 |last1=Armstrong|first1=Terence}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first landing was probably just over a year later when American Captain John Davis, a sealer, set foot on the ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hurtigruten|title=General Information|url=http://people.rit.edu/~msl7852/webdesign/midterm/antarctica.html|website=hurtigruten.com/us/|publisher=Hurtigruten|accessdate=2014-10-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023171055/http://people.rit.edu/~msl7852/webdesign/midterm/antarctica.html|archivedate=2014-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic geography of the Antarctic coastline was not understood until the mid-to-late 19th century. American naval officer [[Charles Wilkes]] claimed (correctly) that Antarctica was a new continent, basing the claim on his exploration in 1839–40,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Van Doren, Charles Lincoln |author2=McHenry, Robert |title=Webster's Guide to American History: A Chronological, Geographical, and Biographical Survey and Compendium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MVU6DS6Re8gC&amp;pg=PA1326+|year=1971|publisher=Merriam-Webster|isbn=978-0-87779-081-5|page=1326}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[James Clark Ross]], in his expedition of 1839–43, hoped that he might be able to sail all the way to the South Pole. (He was unsuccessful.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Berkman, Paul Arthur |title=Science Into Policy: Global Lessons from Antarctica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LDiGTYXZ9X4C&amp;pg=PA35+|year=2002|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-091560-6|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1900–1950===

British explorer [[Robert Falcon Scott]] on the [[Discovery Expedition]] of 1901–04 was the first to attempt to find a route from the Antarctic coastline to the South Pole. Scott, accompanied by [[Ernest Shackleton]] and [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Edward Wilson]], set out with the aim of travelling as far south as possible, and on 31 December 1902, reached 82°16′ S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Berkman, Paul Arthur |title=Science Into Policy: Global Lessons from Antarctica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LDiGTYXZ9X4C&amp;pg=PA37|year=2002|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-091560-6|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shackleton later returned to Antarctica as leader of the British Antarctic Expedition ([[Nimrod Expedition]]) in a bid to reach the Pole. On 9 January 1909, with three companions, he reached 88°23' S&amp;nbsp;– {{Convert|112|mi|km}} from the Pole&amp;nbsp;– before being forced to turn back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Simpson-Housley, Paul |title=Antarctica: Exploration, Perception and Metaphor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1ql3mx8xYgC&amp;pg=PA24|date= 2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-03602-0|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first men to reach the Geographic South Pole were the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|Roald Amundsen and his party]] on December 14, 1911. Amundsen named his camp [[Polheim]] and the entire plateau surrounding the Pole ''[[King Haakon VII Vidde]]'' in honour of King [[Haakon VII of Norway]]. Robert Falcon Scott returned to Antarctica with his second expedition, the [[Terra Nova Expedition]], initially unaware of Amundsen's secretive expedition. Scott and four other men reached the South Pole on January 17, 1912, thirty-four days after Amundsen. On the return trip, Scott and his four companions all died of starvation and extreme cold.

In 1914 Ernest Shackleton's [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] set out with the goal of crossing Antarctica via the South Pole, but his ship, the ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]'', was frozen in [[Sea ice|pack ice]] and sank 11 months later. The overland journey was never made.

US Admiral [[Richard Evelyn Byrd]], with the assistance of his first pilot [[Bernt Balchen]], became the first person to fly over the South Pole on November 29, 1929.

===1950–present===
[[Image:SPSM.05.jpg|thumb|[[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]].

The ceremonial pole and flags can be seen in the background, slightly to the left of centre, below the tracks behind the buildings. The actual geographic pole is a few more metres to the left. The buildings are raised on stilts to prevent snow build up.]]
It was not until 31 October 1956 that humans once again set foot at the South Pole, when a party led by Admiral [[George J. Dufek]] of the US Navy landed there in an R4D-5L Skytrain ([[C-47 Skytrain]]) aircraft. The US [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]] was established by air over 1956–1957 for the [[International Geophysical Year]] and has been continuously staffed since then by research and support personnel.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

After Amundsen and Scott, the next people to reach the South Pole ''overland'' (albeit with some air support) were [[Edmund Hillary]] (January 4, 1958) and [[Vivian Fuchs]] (January 19, 1958) and their respective parties, during the [[Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition]]. There have been many subsequent expeditions to arrive at the South Pole by surface transportation, including those by Havola, [[Albert P. Crary|Crary]] and [[Ranulph Twistleton-Wykeham Fiennes|Fiennes]]. The first group of women to reach the pole were Pam Young, Jean Pearson, [[Lois Jones (scientist)|Lois Jones]], Eileen McSaveney, Kay Lindsay and Terry Tickhill in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.southpolestation.com/trivia/igy2/welch/jones.html|title=First Women at Pole|last=|first=|date=|website=South Pole Station|publisher=|access-date=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978-79 Michele Eileen Raney became the first woman to winter at the South Pole.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contentHandler.cfm?id=1954|title=Famous Firsts|last=|first=|date=13 November 2009|website=The Antarctic Sun|publisher=United States Antarctic Program|access-date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to the establishment, in 1987, of the logistic support base at [[Patriot Hills Base Camp]], the South Pole became more accessible to non-government expeditions.

On December 30, 1989, [[Arved Fuchs]] and [[Reinhold Messner]] were the first to traverse Antarctica via the South Pole without animal or motorized help, using only skis and the help of wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suedtirol.info/South_Tyrol/Detail_Famous_persons/D-1208-en-Reinhold_Messner.html |title=Südtirol&amp;nbsp;– Diese Seite existiert nicht |publisher=Suedtirol.info |accessdate=2012-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310043609/http://www.suedtirol.info/South_Tyrol/Detail_Famous_persons/D-1208-en-Reinhold_Messner.html |archivedate=March 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/263444/Antarctica-as-discussed-in-Reinhold-Messner-Italian-explorer |title=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=2012-08-13}}{{dead link|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two women, [[Tori Murden|Victoria E.

The fastest unsupported journey to the Geographic South Pole from the ocean is 24 days and one hour from [[Hercules Inlet]] and was set in 2011 by Norwegian adventurer Christian Eide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Explorersweb |url=http://www.explorersweb.com/polar/news.php?id=19887 |title=Breaking news: Christian Eide bags the South Pole solo speed ski world record |publisher=explorersweb.com |date=2011-01-13 |accessdate=2011-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; who beat the previous solo record set in 2009 by American [[Todd Carmichael]] of 39 days and seven hours, and the previous group record also set in 2009 of 33 days and 23 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=The Canadian Press |url=https://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/563312 |title=Canadians break speed record trekking to South Pole |work=Toronto Star |date=2009-01-07 |accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fastest solo (female), unsupported and unassisted trek to the south pole was performed by [[Hannah McKeand]] from the UK in 2006. She made the journey in 39 days 9hrs 33mins. She started on the 19th November 2006 and finished on the 28 December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=The Jim Patison Group|year=2013|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|location=|pages=76|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2011/12 summer, separate expeditions by Norwegian [[Aleksander Gamme]] and Australians [[Cas and Jonesy|James Castrission and Justin Jones]] jointly claimed the first unsupported trek without dogs or kites from the Antarctic coast to the South Pole and back. The two expeditions started from [[Hercules Inlet]] a day apart, with Gamme starting first, but completing according to plan the last few kilometres together. As Gamme traveled alone he thus simultaneously became the first to complete the task solo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ice Trek Expeditions|url=http://www.icetrek.com/?id=432|accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crossing the Ice|url=http://casandjonesy.com.au/expeditions/crossing-the-ice/| accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilson, nå er vi framme!|url=http://gamme.no/x-blogg/entry/antarktis-2011-2012/wilsonnaerviframme|accessdate=2013-05-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130624120302/http://gamme.no/x-blogg/entry/antarktis-2011-2012/wilsonnaerviframme|archivedate=2013-06-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate and day and night==
{{see also|Climate of Antarctica|Midnight sun|Polar night}}

During the southern winter (March–September), the South Pole receives no sunlight at all, and from May 11 to August 1, between extended periods of twilight, it is completely dark (apart from moonlight). In the summer (September–March), the sun is continuously above the horizon and appears to move in a counter-clockwise circle. However, it is always low in the sky, reaching a maximum of 23.5° in December. Much of the sunlight that does reach the surface is reflected by the white snow. This lack of warmth from the sun, combined with the high altitude (about {{convert|2800|m|ft|sigfig=2}}), means that the South Pole has one of the coldest climates on Earth (though it is not quite the coldest; that record goes to the region in the vicinity of the [[Vostok Station]], also in Antarctica, which lies at a higher elevation).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090610045758/http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/scienceques2001/20020118.htm Science question of the week], Goddard Space Flight Center.&lt;/ref&gt; Temperatures at the South Pole are much lower than at the North Pole, primarily because the South Pole is located at altitude in the middle of a continental land mass, while the North Pole is at sea level in the middle of an ocean, which acts as a reservoir of heat.

The South Pole is at an altitude of {{convert|9300|ft|m|sigfig=2}} but feels like {{convert|11000|ft|m|sigfig=2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usap.gov/travelAndDeployment/contentHandler.cfm?id=1819|title=The USAP Portal: Science and Support in Antarctica - Course Material|website=www.usap.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Centrifugal force from the spin of the planet pulls the atmosphere toward the equator. The South Pole is colder than the [[North Pole]] because of the elevation difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-the-south-pole-col/|title=Why is the South Pole colder than the North Pole?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North Pole is a few feet from sea level.

In midsummer, as the sun reaches its maximum elevation of about 23.5 degrees, high temperatures at the South Pole in January average at {{convert|-25.9|C|F|0|abbr=on}}.  As the six-month "day" wears on and the sun gets lower, temperatures drop as well: they reach {{convert|-45|C|F|0|abbr=on}} around sunset (late March) and sunrise (late September). In midwinter, the average temperature remains steady at around {{convert|-58|C|F|0|abbr=on}}. The highest temperature ever recorded at the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station was {{convert|-12.3|C|F|1|abbr=on}} on Christmas Day, 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://amrc.ssec.wisc.edu/blog/2011/12/28/preliminary-report-record-temperatures-at-south-pole-and-nearby-aws-sites/|title=Preliminary Report: Record Temperatures at South Pole (and nearby AWS sites…)|date=2011-12-28|author=Matthew A. Lazzara|accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the lowest was {{convert|-82.8|C|F|1|abbr=on}} on June 23, 1982&lt;ref&gt;[http://quest.nasa.gov/antarctica/background/NSF/sp-stay.html Your stay at Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060202103223/http://quest.nasa.gov/antarctica/background/NSF/sp-stay.html |date=2006-02-02 }}, National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niwa.co.nz/education-and-training/schools/resources/climate/antarctic |title=How cold is the Antarctic? |publisher=NIWA |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icecube.wisc.edu/pole/weather|title=Antarctic Weather|accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (for comparison, the lowest temperature directly recorded anywhere on earth was {{convert|-89.2|C|F|1|abbr=on}} at [[Vostok Station]] on July 21, 1983, though {{convert|-93.2|C|F|1|abbr=on}} was measured indirectly by satellite in [[East Antarctica]] between [[Dome A]] and [[Dome F]] in August 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasa-usgs-landsat-8-satellite-pinpoints-coldest-spots-on-earth/ "NASA-USGS Landsat 8 Satellite Pinpoints Coldest Spots on Earth"], ''NASA'', December 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;).

The South Pole has a [[polar climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''[[Ice cap climate|EF]]''). It resembles a desert, receiving very little precipitation. Air humidity is near zero. However, high winds can cause the blowing of snowfall, and the accumulation of snow amounts to about {{convert|20|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/stis1993/opp93103/opp93103.txt Initial environmental evaluation&amp;nbsp;– development of blue-ice and compacted-snow runways], National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs, April 9, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The former dome seen in pictures of the Amundsen–Scott station is partially buried due to snow storms, and the entrance to the dome had to be regularly bulldozed to uncover it. More recent buildings are raised on stilts so that the snow does not build up against the sides of them.

==Time==
In most places on Earth, local time is determined by [[longitude]], such that the time of day is more-or-less synchronised to the position of the sun in the sky (for example, at midday the sun is roughly at its highest). This line of reasoning fails at the South Pole, where the sun rises and sets only once per year, and all lines of longitude, and hence all time zones, converge. There is no ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' reason for placing the South Pole in any particular time zone, but as a matter of practical convenience the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station keeps [[New Zealand Time]] (UTC+12/UTC+13). This is because the US flies its resupply missions ("[[Operation Deep Freeze]]") out of [[McMurdo Station]], which is supplied from [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]].

==Flora and fauna==
Due to its exceptionally harsh climate, there are no native resident plants or animals at the South Pole. Remarkably, though, off-course [[south polar skua]]s and [[snow petrel]]s are occasionally seen there.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Sabbatini, [http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/pastIssues/2002-2003/2003_01_05.pdf "Non-human life form seen at Pole"], ''The Antarctic Sun'', 5 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 it was reported that [[microbe]]s had been detected living in the South Pole ice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/827063.stm "Snow microbes found at South Pole"], BBC News, 10 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

== Land Lines ==
To dial a land line in [[Cambodia]] all over the country, the format is Area Code + Phone Number. The area code is 3 digits long, followed by a 6 or 7 digit phone number.

Calls made from outside Cambodia must omit the prefix 0. Therefore, to call a land line number in Phnom Penh from other countries, dialing begins with +855 23 followed by 6 or 7 digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to call Cambodia from the USA/Canada|url=http://www.howtocallabroad.com/cambodia/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Area code ==

#[[Phnom Penh]] - 023
#[[Kandal Province|Kandal]] - 024
#[[Kampong Speu Province|Kampong Speu]] - 025
#[[Kampong Chhnang Province|Kampong Chhnang]] - 026

== Mobile Phones ==
Likewise to call mobile phones from land line or other mobile phones, domestic dialing begins a 0 followed by 8 or 9 digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mobile phone networks and prefixes with price links in Cambodia 2009-10|url=http://cambodia-ict.epipe.com/mobile-phone-networks-and-prefixes-with-price-links-in-cambodia-2009-10_14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile numbers in Cambodia take the form: 0TT-AXX-XXXY.

The first two numbers after the leading 0 or 'TT' in the example above identify the operator. For example, 010 234 567 is an example of a 9 digit mobile number from [[#Network Operators|Smart]]. 088 234 5678 on the other hand is an example of a 10 digit mobile number from [[#Network Operators|Metfone]].

The 3rd digit after the leading 0 or 'A' in the example above must be between 1 and 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NNP for Cambodia|url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/02/02/T02020000230001MSWE.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally this value is between 2 and 9 which allows a value of '1' to be used for mobile phones which are roaming in Cambodia. However some operators such as Mobitel are using a '1' in this range to extend their number ranges for certain popular prefixes. For example, 012 123 4567 and 092 123 456 are valid mobile numbers in Cambodia.

'X' can take the values 0 to 9 and 'Y' is an optional extra digit which is used by some operators.

Most mobile numbers are 8 digits long (excluding the leading 0), however some operators are now using 9 digit numbers. 0882345678 is an example of a valid 9 digit mobile number.

Calls made from outside Cambodia must omit the prefix 0. Therefore, to call a mobile number in Cambodia from other countries, dialing begins with +855 1, +855 8, or +855 9 etc.

'''Tussock grassland''' is a form of open [[grassland]] with [[Tussock (grass)|tussock bunchgrass]] species, that is common in some [[Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] ecoregions of the [[Southern hemisphere]].

==Distribution==
Examples are found in: [[New Zealand]] (e.g. [[New Zealand tussock grasslands]]), [[Australia]], [[Argentina]], temperate areas of southern and eastern [[Africa]], and some [[subantarctic]] islands. 

It is usually typified by low rainfall and poor soils, in which few plants other than hardy  [[Tussock (grass)|tussock grasses]] can flourish.

[[File:Ville souterraine (Bonaventure métro, Montréal).jpg|thumb|right|400px|Part of [[Underground City, Montreal|Montreal's underground city]], a concourse in [[Bonaventure (Montreal Metro)|Bonaventure metro station]]]]

An '''underground city''' is a series of linked [[subterranea (geography)|subterranean spaces]] that may provide a defensive refuge; a place for living, working or shopping; a transit system; [[mausoleum|mausolea]]; wine or storage cellars; [[cisterns]] or drainage channels; or several of these.

The term may also refer to a network of [[tunnel]]s that connects buildings beneath street level that may house office blocks, [[shopping mall]]s, [[metro station]]s, [[theatre]]s, and other attractions. These passages can usually be accessed through the public space of any of the buildings connecting to them, and sometimes have separate entries as well. This latter definition encompasses many modern structures, whereas the former more generally covers tunnel systems from ancient times to the present day.

Underground cities are especially functional in cities with very cold or hot climates, because they permit activities to be comfortably accessible year round without regard to the weather. Underground cities are similar in nature to [[skyway]] systems and may include some buildings linked by skyways or above-ground corridors rather than underground.

Some cities also have underground tunnels that have been abandoned.&lt;ref name=statesman&gt;{{cite web|author=Capi Lynn |url=https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/opinion/columnists/capi-lynn/2015/01/31/john-ritter-salem-history/22627533/ |title=From opium dens to bordellos, historian unearths Salem's past |publisher=Statesmanjournal.com |date=2015-01-30 |accessdate=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chicagotribune&gt;{{Citation

==Argentina==
[[Buenos Aires]], capital of [[Argentina]], has an extensive amount of underground cities in its [[Subte]]. Most stations have small shops, bars and kiosks, while main hubs interconnect through underground pedestrian walkways with railroad stations, governmental buildings, or shopping centres. Some have additional mall-like mezzanine levels, with the Centro [[Obelisk of Buenos Aires]] area (3 lines, 4 underground levels), [[Estación Retiro]], [[Estación Constitución]], [[Estación Once]], and [[Federico Lacroze railway station]] being the most important ones.

==Australia==
[[Sydney]] has a series of underground shopping malls around the underground station [[Town Hall railway station, Sydney|Town Hall]]. The tunnels run south to the George Street cinema district, west under the town hall, and north to [[Pitt Street Mall]] through the [[Queen Victoria Building]]. The northern branch links Queen Victoria Building with Galleries Victoria, Sydney Central Plaza (which in turn links underground to Westfield CentrePoint and internally above ground to Centrepoint, Imperial Arcade, Skygarden, Glasshouse, and the [[MLC Centre]]). The linked centres run for over {{convert|3|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. In 2005, Westfield corporation submitted a development application to link Sydney Central Plaza underground with 3 other properties on Pitt Street Mall and extend the tunnel network by a further {{convert|500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} or more.

[[Perth]] has a small network of underground shopping malls running from the [[St Georges Terrace]] entrance to [[Trinity Arcade]] to [[Murray Street Mall]].

The small town of [[Coober Pedy]] in northern [[South Australia]] has numerous underground residences and other facilities. The area was and is extensively mined for [[opal]], and the settlers lived underground to escape the scorching daytime heat, often exceeding {{convert|40|°C|°F}}.

==Canada==
[[File:Toronto path.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]] entrance, [[Toronto, Ontario]]]]
The cold northern continental climate makes underground pedestrian malls quite useful.
*[[Edmonton]], Alberta has a small system of tunnels and above-ground [[skyway]]s called the [[Edmonton Pedway|Pedway]] connecting buildings and [[Edmonton Transit System#LRT|LRT]] stations of the downtown core.
*[[City of Halifax|Halifax]], Nova Scotia (''[[Downtown Halifax Link]]'') where no point is more than 10 minutes casual walking distance from any other one.
*[[Montreal]], Quebec ''[[Underground City, Montreal|Underground city]]'', or ''la ville souterraine'' in French, is the largest underground network in the world. Its {{convert|32|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of tunnel cover more than 41 city blocks (about {{convert|12|sqkm|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}). Access through the RÉSO can be made to apartment buildings, hotels, offices, banks, and universities, as well as public spaces like retail shops and malls, concert halls, cinemas, the [[Bell Centre]] [[Ice hockey|hockey]] [[arena]], [[museum]]s, seven [[Montreal Metro|metro]] stations, two [[train station]]s ([[Lucien-L'Allier (AMT)|Lucien-L'Allier]] and [[Central Station (Montreal)|Gare Centrale]]), a [[Terminus Centre-Ville (AMT)|bus terminal]] ([[Réseau de transport de Longueuil]] and other transit authorities), and other areas. It connects 80% of office space and 35% of commercial space in downtown Montreal.
**The network began as a connection between [[Place Ville Marie]], the [[Queen Elizabeth Hotel]] and the [[Gare Centrale (Montreal)|Gare Centrale]].
**More than 2,000 shops and 40 cinemas line the passageways. Tourists often visit attractions in the underground city, which is used by an average of half a million Montrealers per day.
**Eight [[Montreal Metro|metro]] stations link to smaller networks that are not yet part of the central network, such as [[Berri-UQAM (Montreal Metro)|Berri UQAM]] in the eastern part of downtown and [[Pie-IX (Montreal Metro)|Pie-IX]] which links venues from the [[1976 Summer Olympics]].
*[[Ottawa]], Ontario's [[Carleton University]] has a five kilometer underground [[Carleton University#Carleton Underground|tunnel network]] which connects ten residence buildings with other buildings on its main campus. The city also has an underground concourse at the [[Place de Ville]] office complex in the [[downtown Ottawa|downtown business district]], connecting 4 office buildings containing over one million square feet of leasable space, and 2 hotels with 900 rooms combined. There are plans to expand the underground network after the [[Confederation Line]], a rapid transit line featuring three downtown subway stations, is completed. It is estimated there will be as many as 20 buildings with direct indoor connections to the downtown subway portion, or 4 million square feet of office space, 1.8 million square feet of retail, 1400 hotel rooms and the [[Ottawa Convention Centre]].
*[[Saskatoon]], Saskatchewan – On the campus of the [[University of Saskatchewan]] a tunnel system connects several of the buildings on campus, this is augmented with overhead walkways that further extend the network.
*[[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]] – At the main campus of [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] are the [[MUNnels#MUNnel System|MUNnels]], a tunnel system, in which all the main buildings are connected, though there are also some [[Skyway|elevated walkways]].
*[[Toronto]], Ontario ("[[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]]"), comprises {{convert|29|km|mi}} of walkways and 1,200 shops. It links many important buildings and attractions downtown to six [[Toronto Transit Commission|TTC]] subway stations. PATH accommodates 100,000 pedestrians daily, and PATH businesses host the world's largest underground sidewalk sale once annually.
**The PATH network in Toronto is the largest underground shopping complex in the world with {{convert|sigfig=3|371600|m2|sqft}}.
**Toronto also has a separate, smaller "underground city" connecting several building complexes and two subway stations on [[Bloor Street]].
*[[Vancouver]], British Columbia has two [[shopping mall]]s, [[Pacific Centre]] and Vancouver Centre, that are interconnected and extend over three city blocks, containing more than 200 stores that weaves above and below ground level. These malls have metro access at [[Granville Station (TransLink)|Granville SkyTrain Station]] on the [[Expo Line (TransLink)|Expo Line]] and [[Vancouver City Centre Station|Vancouver City Centre SkyTrain Station]] on the [[Canada Line]]. Other connections exist between SkyTrain stations and surrounding buildings such is the case with the [[Burrard Station]] connections to the [[Bentall Centre, Vancouver|Bentall Centre]] and the [[Royal Centre (Vancouver)|Royal Centre]] and [[Waterfront Station (Vancouver)|Waterfront Station]]'s links with [[Canada Place]] and the [[Sinclair Centre]].
*[[Winnipeg]], Manitoba has a smaller (mainly commercial office) area located underground in the downtown core below [[Portage and Main]]. Several of the downtown office towers have subterranean entrances to the complex allowing employees and visitors to bypass the downtown traffic and avoid the cold winter temperatures Winnipeg regularly experiences. The system links with the [[skyway]] system known as the [[Winnipeg Walkway]]. Also the [[University of Manitoba]] has underground tunnels for the students to travel from building to building.
*[[Charlottetown]], Prince Edward Island has a tiny system. A pedestrian tunnel connects the [[Confederation Centre of the Arts|Confederation Center of the Arts]] with the Confederation Court Mall. The also mall connects to The Holman Grand Hotel. The Mall is separated into a main section and a much smaller section connected by an overground walkway. This small section of the mall connects to a 338 spot [[Multi-storey car park|parking garage]], which itself connects to the Homburg Financial Building, and has a separate public entry. Apart from the hotel, two additional office buildings are on top and can be assessed through the mall, a building owned by [[National Bank of Canada|National Bank]], and a building owned by [[Business Development Bank of Canada|BDC]].

==Chile==
[[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]] has some elements of an underground city in its "Metro" subway system. While all stations have a small mezzanine level above the tracks for ticket purchase, some key stations have extensive areas of shops and kiosks in addition. Some stations even have an additional mall-like level between the street and the mezzanine levels.

==China==
*[[Beijing]] built an extensive tunnel network called the [[Underground City (Beijing)|Underground City]] ({{lang-zh|t=地下城|s=地下城|p=Dìxià Chéng}}) during the [[Sino-Soviet split|Sino-Soviet conflict]], supposedly covering 85&amp;nbsp;km², falling into disuse in the 1970s. It was opened in 2000 to the public and tourists, but closed in 2008 for renovations.&lt;ref name=CNN1&gt;Jiang, Steven. "[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/01/30/oly.journal1/index.html Beijing Journal: An underground 'parallel universe']". Cable News Network (2008-02-01). Retrieved on 2008-07-14.&lt;/ref&gt; There are rumors it was used by the army during the [[Tiananmen incident]]. As of 1 July 2009, all "official" remaining entrances appear to be closed.
*[[Guangzhou]] has a large underground network connecting the office towers malls and metro stations located in [[Zhujiang New Town]]. In addition there are large underground malls surrounding several [[Guangzhou Metro]] stations such as [[Tiyu Xilu Station|Tiyu Xilu]], [[Jiangnan West Station|Jiangnan West]], [[Gongyuanqian Station|Gongyuanqian]], [[Martyrs' Park Station|Martyrs' Park]] and [[Guangzhou East Railway Station]].
*[[Harbin]] has a number of large, multi-level underground shopping areas, originally built for air defense. The largest is at the roundabout intersection of Xida Zhi street and Hongjun street where three levels of markets following streets from four directions meet under the giant snowflake atrium.
*[[Hangzhou]] has an underground mall in [[Wulin Square]] connected to a [[Wulin Square Station|subway station]] of the same name and nearby office buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ori.hangzhou.com.cn/ornews/content/2012-12/28/content_4541276.htm|title=杭州最大的地下商城今天开建 地铁站直通杭州大厦（图） - 杭网原创 - 杭州网|website=ori.hangzhou.com.cn|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hong Kong]]: Many [[MTR]] stations in Hong Kong form extended underground networks connecting to [[building]]s and at the basement of some major [[shopping malls]] in the area above. The stations themselves house a number of retail shops. Notable examples are the [[Central (MTR)|Central]]–[[Hong Kong (MTR)|Hong Kong]] stations and the [[Tsim Sha Tsui (MTR)|Tsim Sha Tsui]]–[[East Tsim Sha Tsui Station|East Tsim Sha Tsui]] stations. Only rarely are there not any shops. Additional underground networks have been proposed for [[Causeway Bay]] in 2006 and in [[Kwun Tong]] under Hoi Yuen Road in 2010. As of 2014, studies are underway for underground networks in [[Tsim Sha Tsui]], [[Kowloon Park]], [[Victoria Park, Hong Kong|Victoria Park]], [[Causeway Bay]], [[Happy Valley, Hong Kong|Happy Valley]], [[Admiralty]], [[Wan Chai]] and [[Hong Kong Park]].
*[[Nanjing]] has an underground mall around [[Xinjiekou station (Nanjing Metro)|Xinjiekou metro station]].
*[[Qingdao]] has two small underground shopping areas, one at the head of the Zhanqiao (pier) and one west of the Qingdao guest house.
*[[Shanghai]] has a few underground networks, most notably at People's Square metro station, wherein the line 2 station has a second mezzanine full of shops and line 1 is connected to a large underground shopping gallery at its south end. Shanghai Science Museum stop on line 2 has a large underground shopping area, known for its imitation goods. Huangpi Road South and Xujiahui stations are directly connected to shopping centers, and the Lujiazui station is connected to the Bank of China tower.
*[[Shenzhen]] has quite a few underground shopping malls:
**Link City ({{lang-zh|t=連城新天地|s=连城新天地}}), between Shenzhen metro stations [[Convention and Exhibition Center Station (Shenzhen)|Convention and Exhibition Center Station]] and [[Shopping Park Station]], used to be an air-raid shelter.
**A network of subterranean retail tunnels surrounding several [[Shenzhen Metro]] stations such as [[Chegongmiao Station|Chegongmiao]], [[Laojie Station|Laojie]], [[Science Museum Station|Science Museum]], [[Luohu Station|Luohu]], [[Civic Center Station (Shenzhen)|Civic Center]], [[Huangbeiling station|Huangbeiling]], and [[Window of the World station|Window of the World]].
**An underground electronics market connecting [[Huaqiang Road Station|Huaqiang Road]], [[Huaqiang North station|Huaqiang North]] and [[Huaxin station|Huaxin]].
*[[Wuhan]] an underground mall is located under Hanyang Avenue.

==Finland==
*[[Helsinki]] underground covers the [[Helsinki Central railway station|central railway station]] area, two subway stations ([[Rautatientori metro station|Rautatientori]], [[Kamppi metro station|Kamppi]]) and shopping malls. The [[Kamppi]] metro station is integrated with the [[Kamppi Center]] ({{convert|55000|m2|sqft|0|abbr=on}}) long-distance bus terminal, freight depot and internal parking area, all underground. It features a six-storey shopping complex and a central bus terminal for local buses. The underground network has connections to the nearby [[Forum (shopping centre)|Forum shopping centre]] and [[Sokos]] and [[Stockmann, Helsinki centre|Stockmann]] department stores.
*Three other subway stations in Helsinki have similar, smaller undergrounds: [[Hakaniemi metro station|Hakaniemi]], [[Kaisaniemi metro station|Kaisaniemi]], and [[Sörnäinen metro station|Sörnäinen]].

==France==
*[[Paris]]:
**The [[mines of Paris]] are several disconnected networks of more than {{convert|300|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of mining tunnels started in the 13th century and dominated by the "large south network" on the [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]], of which {{convert|1.7|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} was repurposed from 1786 as the [[Catacombs of Paris]] ossuary, the final resting place of 6-7 million Parisians.{{ref|http://www.parislogue.com/catacombs}}. Other parts of the tunnel network have long been closed off for safety reasons, but the tunnels have served as safe passageways during war and revolution, routes for [[urban explorer]]s, and venues for unauthorized cultural activities.
**[[La Défense]], the major business district northwest of the city center built in the 1960s, has an extensive network of commercial passageways under a vast plaza centered on the [[Gare de La Défense]] and radiating out to connect with surrounding buildings, notably the large [[Les Quatre Temps]] shopping center and [[CNIT]], but enabling access to many buildings of the district.
**The [[Forum des Halles]] is a partially underground multilevel commercial and shopping center connected to the massive underground transit hub [[Chatelet-Les-Halles]]. Opened in 1979, passageways extend west under the [[Jardin Nelson Mandela]] for several city blocks, and within the fare zone of the [[Paris Metro]], stretch half a kilometer south to the banks of the [[River Seine]].{{ref|http://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/565789plancumule2.png}}
*[[Naours]]: {{convert|33|m|ft|0}} below the [[Picardy]] village of Naours (between Doullens and Amiens), the 28 galleries ({{convert|2000|m|ft|0}} long) of an ancient limestone quarry (exploited since the 3rd century c.e.) have long been used as shelter by the population seeking refuge from invaders. Occupied by the [[Triple Entente]] forces during [[World War I|WWI]], and then used as headquarters by the German Army during the [[World War II|WWII]] occupation of France, the galleries are now open to visitors.
*[[Arras]]: During [[World War I]], the French and British Army built an underground tunnel system (''boves'') based upon the already existing [[adit]]s from a formerly used [[quarry]]. Scots and Englishmen used the quarry below the quarter Saint-Sauveur and called it "Glasgow", "Manchester" and "Liverpool". The [[New Zealand Army]] (bonded with the British Army) used the quarry for constructing another tunnel system below the quarter Ronville and called it "Wellington", "Auckland" and "Nelson".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lavoixdunord.fr/culture-loisirs/notre-tournee-des-visites-souterraines-a-arras-retour-ia0b0n2295600&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers from these armed forces hid in the tunnels for several days. On April 9, 1917, 5:30 am, 24,000 soldiers ran out from there to encounter German troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wegedererinnerung-nordfrankreich.com/die-wege/die-front/arras-der-wellington-steinbruch.html|title=Arras - Der Wellington-Steinbruch- Wege der Erinnerung des Ersten Weltkriegs im Nord-Pas de Calais|website=www.wegedererinnerung-nordfrankreich.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
*[[Berlin]]: Several buildings on the east side of Friedrichstraße, from Quartier 205 (Friedrichstraße 70) northwards up to Galerie Lafayette are connected to each other. Businesses are on both sides of the underground street so that it appears to be inside a building all the time, even when it crosses Taubenstraße underground.

:Extensive underground bunkers still exist all throughout the city centre, although they are largely sealed off and closed to the public.

:All of the buildings at the large Charité Virchow campus are connected via a system of spacious underground tunnels. In addition to employee use, particularly during inclement weather, there is also a rudimentary robotic system via which mail and packages are delivered across campus.

*[[Frankfurt am Main]]: Underground shopping malls, called 'B-Ebene' in Frankfurt, of considerable size are found at Hauptbahnhof (central station) and Hauptwache.
*[[Hamburg]]: The [[Jungfernstieg railway station|Jungfernstieg]] and Rathaus subway stations and several entrances are connected by pedestrian tunnels, some of them contain shops. There is a direct access to the Europapassage shopping mall.
*[[Munich]]: Underground shopping mall at Karlsplatz/Stachus. This combines the underpass that leads to the pedestrian area and the entry to the subway system.
*[[Stuttgart]]: There is a large underground shopping mall (Klettpassage) connecting the Hauptbahnhof (central station) with the main shopping street, the Königstraße.

==Greece==
In [[Thessaloniki]], [[Hellenistic]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Byzantine]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] monuments coexist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.makthes.gr/news/reportage/64182 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120904012857/http://www.makthes.gr/news/reportage/64182 |archivedate=2012-09-04 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that bear witness to the city history and its significance. Several of the underground secrets of Thessaloniki have been discovered and emerged, while restoration work is under process. Although the final result is impressive with underground monuments such as the Catacombs of St. John and the underground museum of the [[Agora]], they do not comprise highlights for the city and access is still very limited or not permitted even to the locals by the Archaeological Department of the Thessaloniki underground [[Metro (rapid transit)|Metro]] project.

==Iran==
*[[Kish, Iran|Kish]]: An underground city by the name of [[Kish Island#Kish Hidden Pearl|Hidden Pearl]] was constructed of roads interlinked 20 meters (66&amp;nbsp;ft.) under the ground. Shops and restaurants are planned to be built.
*[[Tehran]]: Tehran has made a series of underground pathways in and around [[Vali-e Asr Metro Station]] and is in planning stage to increase commercial activity in newly built buildings in the central part of the city. The priorities for future development are expansion of underground connections around [[Haft-e Tir Metro Station]] and [[Meydan-e Vali-e Asr Metro Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khabaronline.ir/(X(1)S(0uk2gswgejx1axjzleh03jcn))/detail/473009/society/453|title=سال آینده میدان هفت تیر زیرزمینی می شود|website=www.khabaronline.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Isfahan]]: With the completion of [[Imam Hosein Metro Station (Isfahan)|Imam Hosein Metro Station]], and [[Jahan Nama Complex]], and their eventual underground connection, there would be an underground complex of a length of 300 m formed in Isfahan downtown area. Also, not underground per se, with [[Imam Ali Square]]'s street network being dug underground and a large open space plaza being constructed on the top, the plaza is connected through a series of covered bazaar pathways of a length exceeding 4&amp;nbsp;km, connecting it to [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]].

==Italy==
[[File:Shiodome City Center underground.jpg|right|thumb|[[Shiodome City Center]] underground in [[Minato, Tokyo]], Japan]]
*[[Ancient Rome]] had [[catacombs of Rome|a network of catacombs]], ancient Jewish and Christian underground burial places near the city.
*[[Naples]] has [[Beneath Naples|many chambers and tunnels]] beneath the city, including channels and reservoirs for water, and [[Catacombs of San Gennaro|catacombs]].

==Japan==
The top five largest underground "cities" (地下街, ''chikagai'') in Japan are all shopping districts:
[[File:Tenjin Chikagai(Tenjin Underground City) - 02.JPG|right|thumb|Tenjin Underground City in [[Chūō-ku, Fukuoka|Chūō-ku]], [[Fukuoka]], [[Fukuoka Prefecture]], [[Japan]]]]

*Diamor Osaka in [[Kita-ku, Osaka]] — {{convert|42977|sqm|sqft|0|abbr=on}}
*[[Osaka]] has enormous underground networks in the [[Umeda]], [[Namba]], and [[Shinsaibashi]] districts, in which Umeda alone includes over 1,200 retail stores and restaurants, as well as subway and intercity rail stations.
*See also [[Alice City]].
*[[Tokyo]]'s subway lines are owned by [[Tokyo Metro]] (9 lines) and [[Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation|Toei]] (4 lines), mostly within the [[23 special wards]]. Near the center of the city, connecting passages between stations that span a few blocks exist for commuters. Stations such as [[Shinjuku Station|Shinjuku]] and [[Shibuya Station|Shibuya]] have underground shopping malls. Tokyo's network of tunnels is seen as one of the many [[metropolitan area|megalopolis]] features of the city.

==Jordan==
[[Jordan]] boasts the city of [[Petra]] — "rose-red city, half as old as time" — carved from the [[Rock-cut architecture|living rock]].

==Mexico==
[[Guanajuato]] city was built over old silver mines, some of which are used as roads. The [[Mexico DF]] metro system has many underground pedestrian walkways connecting stations.

==Netherlands==

*[[Cappadocia]] contains several historical underground cities carved out of unusual geological formations formed via the eruptions of ancient volcanoes. The cities were initially inhabited by the [[Hittites]], then later by early [[Christian]]s as hiding places (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20061211161101/http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Cappadocia/history.htm]). They are now archeological and tourist sites but are not generally occupied (see [[Kaymakli Underground City]], [[Derinkuyu underground city]], [[Özkonak Underground City]], [[Mazı Underground City]]). The latest large underground city was discovered in 2007 in Gaziemir, Güzelyurt.

*[[Dayton, Ohio]]: [[Wright State University]] Main Campus. The Wright State tunnel system is believed to be one of the most extensive collegiate pedestrian tunnel systems in the United States. Nearly two miles of tunnels (10,436 feet)&lt;ref name="webapp2.wright.edu"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://webapp2.wright.edu/web1/newsroom/2013/02/13/digging-into-the-history-of-wright-states-tunnels/|title=Wright State mythbuster: the tunnel system|newspaper=Wright State Newsroom|language=en-us|access-date=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; snake their way beneath Wright State’s Dayton campus linking 20 of 22 buildings in the academic section of campus. Wright State’s founders realized just how valuable a tunnel system could be for the university’s future physical organization. The idea of a passageway that connects most buildings on campus "fit with the urban-centered university concept" that was originally envisioned for Wright State.&lt;ref name="webapp2.wright.edu"/&gt; The tunnels provide the university with a consolidated campus core with a minimal physical imprint on the surrounding land. Moreover, the founders considered the added levels of handicap accessibility the tunnel system would provide. As the tunnels began to expand concurrently with Wright State’s development, so did the disability services program.&lt;ref name="webapp2.wright.edu"/&gt; Now, Wright State is recognized nationally as one of the most accessible and disability-friendly universities. Out of 2,500 four-year colleges in the US, only five provide academic and personal services comprehensive enough for a student with serious physical disabilities to live on campus — and Wright State is one of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityfriendlycolleges.com|title=disabilityfriendlycolleges.com|website=www.disabilityfriendlycolleges.com|access-date=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tunnel system is a major part of why the campus is so friendly to handicapped students, faculty, and employees.

*[[Richmond, Virginia]]: There are a series of connected tunnels between state government buildings in the city of Richmond. Certain passageways are locked off but a good portion of the tunnels are accessible from buildings. The purpose of the tunnels is not generally known; the two most common explanations are that they were built to allow people to move between buildings in inclement weather or that they were built as part of an emergency evacuation plan.
*[[Rochester, Minnesota]]: The [[Mayo Clinic]]'s buildings in the downtown area are interconnected with tunnels and skyways.

*[[File:ShirleysWhiteHouseVicksburg1863.jpg|right|thumb|Shirley's White House Vicksburg in 1863]][[Vicksburg, Mississippi]] During the [[Siege of Vicksburg]] in 1863, Union gunboats lobbed over 22,000 shells into the town and army artillery fire was even heavier. As the barrages continued, suitable housing in Vicksburg was reduced to a minimum. A ridge, located between the main town and the rebel defense line, provided a diverse citizenry with lodging for the duration. Over 500 caves were dug into the yellow clay hills of Vicksburg. Whether houses were structurally sound or not, it was deemed safer to occupy these dugouts. People did their best to make them comfortable, with rugs, furniture, and pictures. They tried to time their movements and foraging with the rhythm of the cannonade, sometimes unsuccessfully. Because of these dugouts or caves, the Union soldiers gave the town the nickname of "Prairie Dog Village." Despite the ferocity of the Union fire against the town, fewer than a dozen civilians were known to have been killed during the entire siege.
*[[Walt Disney World]], [[Florida]] (southwest of [[Orlando, Florida]]) has a network of [[utility tunnel]]s used by its employees (cast members) for transportation between venues, rest areas, staff preparation, and first aid.

The '''Universal Transverse Mercator''' ('''UTM''') [[Map projection#Projections by preservation of a metric property|conformal projection]] uses a [[2-dimensional]] [[Cartesian coordinate system]] to give locations on the surface of the [[Earth]]. Like the traditional method of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]], it is a [[horizontal position representation]], i.e. it is used to identify locations on the Earth independently of [[altitude|vertical position]]. However, it differs from that method in several respects.

The UTM system is not a single [[map projection]]. The system instead divides the Earth into sixty zones, each being a six-degree band of longitude, and uses a [[Secant line|secant]] [[transverse Mercator projection]] in each zone.
[[image:Utm-zones.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The UTM grid.]]

==History==
Most American published sources do not indicate an origin for the UTM system. The [[NOAA]] website states the system to have been developed by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], starting in the early 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/stories_tales/geod1.html|title=NOAA History - Stories and Tales of the Coast &amp; Geodetic Survey - Technology Tales/Geodetic Surveys in the US The Beginning and the next 100 years|author=|date=|website=www.history.noaa.gov|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published material{{specify}} that does state an origin apparently based on that account. However, a series of aerial photos found in the Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv (the military section of the [[German Federal Archives]]) apparently dating from 1943–1944 bear the inscription UTMREF followed by grid letters and digits, and projected according to the transverse Mercator,&lt;ref name="Buchroithner"&gt;[[Manfred Buchroithner|BUCHROITHNER, Manfred F.]]; PFAHLBUSCH, René. Geodetic grids in authoritative maps–new findings about the origin of the UTM Grid. Cartography and Geographic Information Science, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; a finding that would indicate that something called the UTM Reference system was developed in the 1942–43 time frame by the [[Wehrmacht]]. It was probably carried out by the Abteilung für Luftbildwesen (Department for Aerial Photography). From 1947 onward the US Army employed a very similar system, but with the now-standard 0.9996 scale factor at the central meridian as opposed to the German 1.0.&lt;ref name="Buchroithner" /&gt; For areas within the [[contiguous United States]] the [[Alexander Ross Clarke|Clarke]] [[Earth ellipsoid#Historical Earth ellipsoids|Ellipsoid]] of 1866&lt;ref&gt;Equatorial radius 6,378,206.4 meters, polar radius 6,356,583.8 meters&lt;/ref&gt; was used. For the remaining areas of Earth, including [[Hawaii]], the [[International Ellipsoid]]&lt;ref&gt;Equatorial radius 6,378,388 meters, reciprocal of the flattening 297 exactly&lt;/ref&gt; was used. The [[World Geodetic System|WGS84]] ellipsoid is now generally used to model the Earth in the UTM coordinate system, which means current UTM northing at a given point can differ up to 200 meters from the old. For different geographic regions, other datum systems (e.g.: ED50, NAD83) can be used.

Prior to the development of the Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system, several European nations demonstrated the utility of grid-based conformal maps by mapping their territory during the [[interwar period]]. Calculating the distance between two points on these maps could be performed more easily in the field (using the [[Pythagorean theorem]]) than was possible using the trigonometric formulas required under the graticule-based system of [[Geographic coordinate system|latitude and longitude]]. In the post-war years, these concepts were extended into the Universal Transverse Mercator/[[Universal Polar Stereographic]] (UTM/UPS) coordinate system, which is a global (or universal) system of grid-based maps.

The transverse Mercator projection is a variant of the [[Mercator projection]], which was originally developed by the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] geographer and cartographer [[Gerardus Mercator]], in 1570. This projection is [[Conformal map projection#Conformal|conformal]], which means it preserves angles and therefore shapes across small regions. However, it distorts distance and area.

==Definitions==

===UTM zone===
[[File:Utm-zones-USA.svg|thumb| Simplified view of [[Contiguous United States|contiguous US]] UTM zones, projected with Lambert conformal conic.]]
The UTM system divides the Earth into 60 zones, each 6° of longitude in width. Zone 1 covers longitude 180° to 174° W; zone numbering increases eastward to zone 60, which covers longitude 174°E to 180°. The polar regions south of [[80th parallel south|80°S]] and north of [[84th parallel north|84°N]] are excluded.

Each of the 60 zones uses a [[transverse Mercator]] projection that can map a region of large north-south extent with low distortion.  By using narrow zones of 6° of longitude (up to 668&amp;nbsp;km) in width, and reducing the [[Scale (map)|scale]] factor along the central [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] to 0.9996 (a reduction of 1:2500), the amount of distortion is held below 1 part in 1,000 inside each zone.  Distortion of scale increases to 1.0010 at the zone boundaries along the [[equator]].

In each zone the scale factor of the central meridian reduces the diameter of the transverse cylinder to produce a secant projection with two [[standard line]]s, or lines of true scale, about 180&amp;nbsp;km on each side of, and about parallel to, the central meridian (Arc cos 0.9996 = 1.62° at the Equator).  The scale is less than 1 inside the standard lines and greater than 1 outside them, but the overall distortion is minimized.

===Overlapping grids===
[[File:Modified UTM Zones.png|thumb|Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Grid Zones 31N thru 37N differ from the standard 6° wide by 84° zone for the northern hemisphere, in part to accommodate the southern half of the Kingdom of Norway. For more on its history, see Clifford J. Mugnier's article on Grids &amp; Datums of The Kingdom of Norway that appeared in the October 1999 issue of PE&amp;RS http://www.asprs.org/a/resources/grids/10-99-norway.pdf]]

Distortion of scale increases in each UTM zone as the boundaries between the UTM zones are approached. However, it is often convenient or necessary to measure a series of locations on a single grid when some are located in two adjacent zones. Around the boundaries of large scale maps (1:100,000 or larger) coordinates for both adjoining UTM zones are usually printed within a minimum distance of 40&amp;nbsp;km on either side of a zone boundary. Ideally, the coordinates of each position should be measured on the grid for the zone in which they are located, but because the scale factor is still relatively small near zone boundaries, it is possible to overlap measurements into an adjoining zone for some distance when necessary.

==Latitude bands==
Latitude bands are not a part of UTM, but rather a part of the [[military grid reference system]] (MGRS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=2002-05-29 | title=Military Map Reading 201 | url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/coordsys/mmr201.pdf | publisher=[[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] | format=PDF | accessdate=2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are however sometimes used.

===Latitude bands===
Each zone is segmented into 20 latitude bands. Each latitude band is 8 degrees high, and is lettered starting from "C" at [[80th parallel south|80°S]], increasing up the [[English language|English]] [[alphabet]] until "X", omitting the letters "I" and "O" (because of their similarity to the numerals one and zero). The last latitude band, "X", is extended an extra 4 degrees, so it ends at [[84th parallel north|84°N latitude]], thus covering the northernmost land on Earth.

Latitude bands "A" and "B" do exist, as do bands "Y" and "Z". They cover the western and eastern sides of the Antarctic and Arctic regions respectively. A convenient [[mnemonic]] to remember is that the letter "N" is the first letter in "northern hemisphere", so any letter coming before "N" in the alphabet is in the southern hemisphere, and any letter "N" or after is in the northern hemisphere.

===Notation===
The combination of a zone and a latitude band defines a grid zone. The zone is always written first, followed by the latitude band. For example, (see image, top right), a position in [[Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]], would find itself in zone 17 and latitude band "T", thus the full grid zone reference is "17T". The grid zones serve to delineate irregular UTM zone boundaries. They also are an integral part of the [[military grid reference system]].

A note of caution: A method also is used that simply adds N or S following the zone number to indicate North or South hemisphere (the easting and northing coordinates along with the zone number supplying everything necessary to geolocate a position except which hemisphere). However, this method has caused some confusion since, for instance, "50S" can mean southern hemisphere but also ''grid zone'' "50S" in the northern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;See "The Letter after the UTM Zone Number: Is that a Hemisphere or a Latitudinal Band?", [http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/coordsys/grids/utm_basics_2005.doc page 7],&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many possible ways to disambiguate between the two methods, two of which are demonstrated later in this article.&lt;!-- No others will be mentioned here, as per WP:NOR --&gt;

===Exceptions===
These grid zones are uniform over the globe, except in two areas. On the southwest coast of [[Norway]], grid zone 32V (9° of longitude in width) is extended further west, and grid zone 31V (3° of longitude in width) is correspondingly shrunk to cover only open water. Also, in the region around [[Svalbard]], the four grid zones 31X (9° of longitude in width), 33X (12° of longitude in width), 35X (12° of longitude in width), and 37X (9° of longitude in width) are extended to cover what would otherwise have been covered by the seven grid zones 31X to 37X. The three grid zones 32X, 34X and 36X are not used.

==Locating a position using UTM coordinates==
A position on the Earth is given by the UTM zone number and the [[easting and northing]] planar coordinate pair in that zone. The [[origin (mathematics)|point of origin]] of each UTM zone is the intersection of the equator and the zone's central meridian. To avoid dealing with negative numbers, the central meridian of each zone is defined to coincide with {{gaps|500|000}} meters East. In any zone a point that has an easting of {{gaps|400|000}} meters is about 100&amp;nbsp;km west of the central meridian. For most such points, the true distance would be slightly more than 100&amp;nbsp;km as measured on the surface of the Earth due to the distortion of the projection. UTM eastings range from about {{gaps|167|000}} meters to {{gaps|833|000}} meters at the equator.

In the northern hemisphere positions are measured northward from zero at the equator. The maximum "northing" value is about {{gaps|9|300|000}} meters at latitude 84 degrees North, the north end of the UTM zones. In the southern hemisphere northings decrease southward from the equator to about {{gaps|1|100|000}} meters at 80 degrees South, the south end of the UTM zones. The northing at the equator is set at {{gaps|10|000|000}} meters so no point has a negative northing value.

The [[CN Tower]] is at {{coord|43|38|33.24|N|79|23|13.7|W|name=CN Tower}}, which is in UTM zone 17, and the grid position is {{gaps|630|084}}&amp;nbsp;m east, {{gaps|4|833|438}}&amp;nbsp;m north. Two points in Zone 17 have these coordinates, one in the northern hemisphere and one in the south; one of two conventions is used to say which:
#Append a hemisphere designator to the zone number, "N" or "S", thus "17N 630084 4833438". This supplies the minimum information to define the position uniquely.
#Supply the grid zone, i.e., the latitude band designator appended to the zone number, thus "17T 630084 4833438". The provision of the latitude band along with northing supplies redundant information (which may, as a consequence, be contradictory if misused).
Because latitude band "S" is in the northern hemisphere, a designation such as "38S" is unclear. The "S" might refer to the latitude band ([[32nd parallel north|32°N]]–[[40th parallel north|40°N]]) or it might mean "South". It is therefore important to specify which convention is being used, e.g., by spelling out the hemisphere, "North" or "South", or using different symbols, such as &amp;minus; for south and + for north.

=== Simplified formulae ===

These formulae are truncated version of [[Transverse Mercator: flattening series]], which were originally derived by [[Johann Heinrich Louis Krüger]] in 1912.&lt;ref name=kruger&gt;Krüger, L. (1912). ''[https://dx.doi.org/10.2312/GFZ.b103-krueger28 Konforme Abbildung des Erdellipsoids in der Ebene]''. Royal Prussian Geodetic Institute, New Series 52.&lt;/ref&gt; They are accurate to around a [[millimeter]] within 3,000&amp;nbsp;km of the central meridian.&lt;ref name=karney&gt;{{cite journal |last=Karney |first=Charles F. F. |date=2011 |title=Transverse Mercator with an accuracy of a few nanometers |journal=J. Geodesy |volume=85 |issue=8 |pages=475–485 |doi=10.1007/s00190-011-0445-3 |arxiv=1002.1417|bibcode=2011JGeod..85..475K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concise commentaries for their derivation have also been given.&lt;ref name=kawase2012&gt;Kawase, K. (2012): [http://www.gsi.go.jp/common/000065826.pdf Concise Derivation of Extensive Coordinate Conversion Formulae in the Gauss-Krüger Projection], Bulletin of the [[Geospatial Information Authority of Japan]], '''60''', pp&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kawase2011&gt;Kawase, K.

The [[WGS 84]] [[spatial reference system]] describes Earth as an [[oblate spheroid]] along north-south axis with an [[equatorial radius]] of &lt;math&gt;a=6378.137&lt;/math&gt; km and an inverse [[flattening]] of &lt;math&gt;1/f=298.257\,223\,563&lt;/math&gt;. Let's take a point of latitude &lt;math&gt;\,\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and of longitude &lt;math&gt;\,\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and compute its UTM coordinates as well as [[Transverse Mercator projection#Point scale|point scale factor]] &lt;math&gt;k\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and [[Transverse Mercator projection#Convergence|meridian convergence]] &lt;math&gt;\gamma\,\!&lt;/math&gt; using a reference meridian of longitude &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{0}&lt;/math&gt;. By convention, in the [[northern hemisphere]] &lt;math&gt;N_{0}=0&lt;/math&gt; km and in the [[southern hemisphere]] &lt;math&gt;N_{0}=10000&lt;/math&gt; km. By convention also &lt;math&gt;k_{0}=0.9996&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{0}=500&lt;/math&gt; km.

In the following formulas, the distances are in [[kilometer]]s. In advance let's compute some preliminary values:

:&lt;math&gt;n=\frac{f}{2-f},\quad 
A=\frac{a}{1+n}\left(1+ \frac{n^2}{4} +\frac{n^4}{64} +\cdots\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_1=\frac{1}{2}n-\frac{2}{3}n^2+\frac{5}{16}n^3,\,\,\,\alpha_2=\frac{13}{48}n^2-\frac{3}{5}n^3,\,\,\,\alpha_3=\frac{61}{240}n^3,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta_1=\frac{1}{2}n-\frac{2}{3}n^2+\frac{37}{96}n^3,\,\,\,\beta_2=\frac{1}{48}n^2+\frac{1}{15}n^3,\,\,\,\beta_3=\frac{17}{480}n^3,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_1=2n-\frac{2}{3}n^2-2n^3,\,\,\,\delta_2=\frac{7}{3}n^2-\frac{8}{5}n^3,\,\,\,\delta_3=\frac{56}{15}n^3.&lt;/math&gt;

==== From latitude, longitude (φ, λ) to UTM coordinates (E, N) ====
First let's compute some intermediate values:

:&lt;math&gt;t=\sinh\left(\tanh^{-1}\sin\varphi-\frac{2\sqrt n}{1+n}\tanh^{-1}\left(\frac{2\sqrt n}{1+n}\sin\varphi\right)\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\xi'=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{t}{\cos(\lambda-\lambda_0)}\right), \,\,\,\eta'=\tanh^{-1}\left(\frac{\sin(\lambda-\lambda_0)}{\sqrt{1+t^2}}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=1+\sum_{j=1}^{3}2j\alpha_j\cos\left(2j\xi'\right)\cosh\left(2j\eta'\right),\,\,\,\tau=\sum_{j=1}^{3}2j\alpha_j\sin\left(2j\xi'\right)\sinh\left(2j\eta'\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The final formulae are:

:&lt;math&gt;E=E_{0}+k_{0}A\left(\eta'+\sum_{j=1}^{3}\alpha_j\cos\left(2j\xi'\right)\sinh\left(2j\eta'\right)\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;N=N_{0}+k_{0}A\left(\xi'+\sum_{j=1}^{3}\alpha_j\sin\left(2j\xi'\right)\cosh\left(2j\eta'\right)\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k=\frac{k_0 A}{a}\sqrt{\left\{1+\left(\frac{1-n}{1+n}\tan\varphi\right)^2\right\}\frac{\sigma^2+\tau^2}{t^2+\cos^2(\lambda-\lambda_0)}},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\tau\sqrt{1+t^2}+\sigma t\tan(\lambda-\lambda_0)}{\sigma\sqrt{1+t^2}-\tau t\tan(\lambda-\lambda_0)}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

==== From UTM coordinates (E, N, Zone, Hemi) to latitude, longitude (φ, λ) ====
Note: Hemi=+1 for Northern, Hemi=-1 for Southern

First let's compute some intermediate values:

:&lt;math&gt;\xi=\frac{N-N_0}{k_0 A},\,\,\,\eta=\frac{E-E_0}{k_0 A},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\xi'=\xi-\sum_{j=1}^{3}\beta_j\sin\left(2j\xi\right)\cosh\left(2j\eta\right), \,\,\,\eta'=\eta-\sum_{j=1}^{3}\beta_j\cos\left(2j\xi\right)\sinh\left(2j\eta\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma'=1-\sum_{j=1}^{3}2j\beta_j\cos\left(2j\xi\right)\cosh\left(2j\eta\right), \,\,\,\tau'=\sum_{j=1}^{3}2j\beta_j\sin\left(2j\xi\right)\sinh\left(2j\eta\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\chi=\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\sin\xi'}{\cosh\eta'}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The final formulae are:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi=\chi+\sum_{j=1}^{3}\delta_j\sin\left(2j\chi\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_{0}=\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{o}\mathrm{n}\mathrm{e}\times 6^\circ - 183^\circ\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda=\lambda_{0}+\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\sinh\eta'}{\cos\xi'}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k=\frac{k_0 A}{a}\sqrt{\left\{1+\left(\frac{1-n}{1+n}\tan\varphi\right)^2\right\}\frac{\cos^2\xi'+\sinh^2\eta'}{\sigma'^2+\tau'^2}},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=\mathrm{H}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{m}\mathrm{i}\times\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\tau'+\sigma'\tan\xi'\tanh\eta'}{\sigma'-\tau'\tan\xi'\tanh\eta'}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

'''Vladimir Afanasyevich Obruchev''' ({{lang-ru|Влади́мир Афана́сьевич О́бручев}}; {{OldStyleDate|October 10|1863|September 28}}, Klepenino near [[Rzhev]], [[Tver Oblast]], [[Russian Empire]]&amp;nbsp;– June 19, 1956, [[Moscow]], [[USSR]]) was a [[Russia]]n and [[USSR|Soviet]] [[geologist]] who specialized in the study of [[Siberia]] and [[Central Asia]]. He was also one of the first [[Russian science fiction]] authors.

==Scientific research==
Vladimir Obruchev graduated from the [[Petersburg Mining Institute]] in 1886. His early work involved the study of gold-mining, which led him to come up with a theory explaining the origin of gold deposits in [[Siberia]]. He also gave advice on construction of the [[Central Asian Railway|Central Asian]] and [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]s and consulted [[Sven Hedin]] on his projected journey to Siberia. While working for the railway, Obruchev explored the [[Karakum Desert]], the shores of the [[Amu Darya]] River, and the old riverbeds of the [[Uzbois]].&lt;ref name="A Word"&gt;''Plutonia'' A Word about the author. p. 404. Translated by Fainna Solasko. Raduga Publishers. Moscow. 1988. 2d printing.&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked as a geologist on [[Lake Baikal]], on the [[Lena River]], and in gold fields near the Vitim.&lt;ref name="A Word"/&gt;

Between 1892 and 1894, Obruchev "was a member of the [[Grigory Potanin]]'s expedition into ... Mongolia, [and] to the mountains of [[Qilian Mountains|Nan Shan]] and Northern China." He also explored the [[Transbaikal]] area, [[Dzhungaria]], and [[Altai Mountains|Altai]].&lt;ref name="A Word" /&gt; Largely as a result of his participation in this expedition he became interested in [[loess]] and made considerable contributions to the study of loess deposits.&lt;ref&gt;Smalley, I., Markovic.S.B. 2017. Four loess pioneers: Charles Lyell, F.von Richthofen, V.A.Obruchev, L.S.Berg. Quaternary International http://dx.doi/10.1016.J.quaint.2016.07.031{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, Obruchev was elected to the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.&lt;ref name="A Word" /&gt;

Having spent half a century in exploring Siberia and Inner Asia, Obruchev summarized his findings with a three-volume [[monograph]], ''The Geology of Siberia'' (1935–1938), followed by ''The History of Geological Exploration of Siberia''. Many of his works deal with the origins of [[loess]] in Central Asia and Siberia, [[ice]] formation and [[permafrost]] in Siberia, problems of Siberian [[tectonics]], and Siberian [[Gold mining|goldfields]]. He also authored many popular scientific works, such as ''Formation of Mountains and Ore Deposits'' (1932), ''Fundamentals of Geology'' (1944), ''Field Geology'' (1927), ''Ore Deposits'' (1928–1929), and others. All together, Obruchev authored
&lt;blockquote&gt;
over a thousand scientific works, among which are a most extensive geological study of Siberia and a five-volume history of the geological exploration of Siberia, which have been awarded the [[Lenin Prize]] as well as the prizes and medals of several scientific societies.&lt;ref name="A Word"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During 1954, he completed an extensive geographical study of [[Qilian Mountains|Nan Shan Mountains]] in [[China]] based on his own and previous expeditions to the region and spent his last years working up a geological study of the mountains.&lt;ref name="A Word"/&gt;

==Popular fiction==

In his native country Obruchev is best known as the author of two perennially popular [[science fiction]] novels, ''[[Plutonia (novel)|Plutonia]]'' (''Плутония'', 1915) and ''[[Sannikov Land]]'' (''Земля Санникова'', 1924). Both of these stories, imitating the pattern of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]'', depict in vivid detail the discovery of an isolated world of prehistoric animals in hitherto unexplored large islands north of Alaska or Siberia. In ''Plutonia'', dinosaurs and other Jurassic species are found in a fictional underground area north of Alaska. The descriptive passages are made more credible by Obruchev's extensive knowledge of [[paleontology]]. "Sannikov Land" is named for a phantom island of the Arctic Ocean, reported historically by Yakov Sannikov in 1811. [[Paul J. McAuley]] praised the novel in a 1999 column, saying "It's true that the characters are indistinguishably wooden mouthpieces for the author's opinions, and the plot is pure [[pulp magazine|pulp]], but all this is redeemed by the novel's rigorous scientific sensibility."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2000/cur0002.htm Curiosities], ''[[F&amp;SF]]'', February 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Soviet period, Obruchev attempted to emulate Edwardian models of boys' [[adventure novel|adventure stories]] in his novels ''Golddiggers in the Desert'' (1928) and ''In the Wilds of Central Asia'' (1951).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9099">The '''water supply in Miyakojima''' involves the history and development of the current water supply on [[Miyakojima]], a small coral island with only one river, which is administered by [[Okinawa Prefecture]] of southwestern [[Japan]].

==Overview==
The water supply in Miyakojima depends mainly on [[Spring (hydrology)|spring water]] or [[ground water]], since there are almost no rivers. Although the yearly rainfall amounts to {{convert|2250|mm|in}}, 40% of it evaporates, 10% flows into the ground and 50% penetrates deep into the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Hirara City History[1979:11]Nakanishi[2002:64]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there is almost no source of surface water.

==Geology==
Beneath the soil of Miyakojima is a [[Ryukyu limestone]] layer which is porous, highly permeable, and does not preserve rainwater. Under the limestone layer is a Shimajiri [[mudstone]] layer of [[bedrock]], which is an impermeable rock. In the local dialect, it is called ''kucha''. Tectonic movements accompanied by several faults have formed underground valleys, and groundwater flows along these valleys. The underground basins are divided into 22 valleys.&lt;ref&gt;''Nihon no Chikei''2001, {{ISBN|4-13-064717-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, 40 per cent of the abundant rainfall on Miyakojima penetrates the surface and quickly flows underground out into the ocean, unused. In addition, the strong subtropical sunshine evaporates as much as 50 per cent of the rainfall. The result is that only 10 per cent of the precipitation flows along the surface. Using natural water resources on Miyakojima has been quite difficult, owing to these natural conditions.

==History==
[[File:Miyako yamato ga.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Entrance to Yamatu-gā]]
[[File:Yamato-ga.jpg|thumb|Yamatu-gā]]

In the past, water in deep [[caves]] was used, as suggested by their language. Namely, the spring is called ''urigā'', which means "going down into the cave and drawing water from the spring".

It was usually several meters deep into the ground, in some cases, 20 meters by stepping down the stone steps.&lt;ref&gt;Tokuyama[2008:]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 13th century, excavation of wells started&lt;ref&gt;Miyakojima Water Committee[1967:17]&lt;/ref&gt; and in an early 18th-century document,&lt;ref&gt;Hirara City History[1979:190]&lt;/ref&gt; 59 wells were recorded. Among them, Yamatsugā which was developed in 1720, was designated as an important site by the Hirara City (now Miyakojima City) education committee. It was a rich spring, and was used only by the government officials at the time. There was a guard posted at the spring.&lt;ref&gt;Nakasone[1988:261-262]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the duty of women to go down to the caves and draw water, and since the [[Meiji era]], girls went down to the caves and draw water, as adult women had other duties.&lt;ref&gt;Nakasone[1988:264]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the increase in population, it became a business to sell water from neighboring places.&lt;ref&gt;Nakasone[1988:255]&lt;/ref&gt;

Collecting rainwater in large vases and tanks started in the [[Taishō era]] (1912–1925). The first water supply by manpower was made in 1924; men walked inside a [[tredmill]] 5 meters in diameter, which drew up a chain of water vases continuously from a well, 23 meters deep. The inventor was Chōgi Itosu, who sold the obtained water. A modern water supply plan was proposed in 1934 in Hirara, but in vain. In 1943, the Japanese Navy completed the first water supply from the Susakadā Well, and after 1945, US forces improved and used it.&lt;ref&gt;Miyakojima Water Committee [1967:31]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1951, a formal construction plan for a water supply from Susakadā to Sodeyama was made and the construction started on March 27, 1952. Many citizens participated in the construction with pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Nakanishi[2002:19]&lt;/ref&gt; Service started on May 4, 1953. In 1954, the construction of water supply started in Gusukube town and by 1977, water supply service covered the entire Miyakojima.&lt;ref&gt;Miyakojima Water Committee[1967:33]12,15&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1964, the US government established the Miyakojima water supply agency, but it was abolished by the inhabitants. On July 1, 1965, a Miyakojima water supply and sewage organization was established&lt;ref&gt;Miyakojima Water Committee[1967:37]16&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the increase in the demand of water, investigations on the situation of ground water were started in 1962. On July 15, 1965, Miyakojima ground water control regulations were determined; which were renewed on May 23, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Miyakojima Water Organization[1996:242]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, there was a considerable [[drought]] in Miyakojima; leading to the investigation for new water sources. Projects for an [[underground dam]] and the conversion of Yonaha Bay into a fresh water lake were considered. The Yonaha Bay project met an opposition campaign in 1981 and was cancelled in 1983. The underground dam project continued and the Fukuzato underground dam and Sunakawa underground dam were completed in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Miyakojima Water Organization[1996:248]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, rainfall dropped to two-thirds of the annual mean. Water restrictions continued from January 21 to April 1.&lt;ref&gt;Miyakojima Water Organization[1996:103]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present water sources==
There are springs in the caves such as Yamatu-gā, Susakadā, Bisa-gā, Bora-gā and Kubaka-gā. There is only one river flowing on the surface, Sakida-gā, only {{convert|3|km}} long. The largest spring, called Susakadā, covered all areas of Miyakojima; but after the drought of 1971, the water source of Sodeyama was developed. After the drought of 1993, water sources of Ōno, Nyātsu, Sokohara were developed. There are ''Sodeyama Purification Plant'' and ''Kajidō Purification Plant'', and service reservoirs are at Hisamatsu, Shijō, Karimata and Bora.&lt;ref&gt;Miyakojima Water Organization[1996:103]&lt;/ref&gt; Two underground reservoirs were completed in 1989 in Susakadā, both 40,000 cubic meters.&lt;ref&gt;Miyakojima Water Organization[1996:219]&lt;/ref&gt; The water in Miyakojima is [[hard water]], which is unsatisfactory both in taste and in the handling of metallic tableware. In 1999, adjustments to the [[pH]] were started at Sodeyama with [[water softening]] using [[lime softening]] in a pellet-reactor.&lt;ref&gt;Shimoji[2001:72]&lt;/ref&gt; Strict surveillance of the quality of the water supply is being done to prevent contamination through infiltration by [[fertilizer]]s and other sources of local drainage.&lt;ref&gt;Shimoji[2001:72]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''What Remains of Edith Finch''''' is a [[adventure game]] developed by [[Giant Sparrow]] and published by [[Annapurna Interactive]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] in 2017. 

The game is centered around the character of Edith Finch, the last in the Finch family line which have a perceived curse that causes all but one member of each generation to die in unusual ways. Edith has returned to her family's home off the coast of Washington state following her mother's death to explore the house they had hastily abandoned years before. She learns about her relatives and their own deaths by visiting their bedrooms, sealed off and treated as shrines to them, with each death played out in a short gameplay sequence to the player. The game is presented as an [[anthology]] of these mini-experiences, wrapped in the [[Drama (film and television)|dramatic]] retelling of the family's history and fate through Edith's narration.

''What Remains of Edith Finch'' was met with very positive reception from critics, who praised its story and presentation, and is considered an example of [[video games as an art form]]. It won [[14th British Academy Games Awards|British Academy Games Award for Best Game 2017]], and won the Best Narrative category at both the 2018 [[Game Developers Choice Awards]] and [[The Game Awards 2017]], among other awards and nominations.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Edith finch lewis story screencap.jpg|thumb|left|In one mini-experience for Lewis Finch, the player must manipulate Lewis' imaginary fantasy setting on the left side of the screen, while continuing to bring the fish to the right side to a slicer to decapitate them with a separate set of controls.]]
The game is a first-person exploration game, as the player explores the Finch house and surrounding wilderness through a linear series of rooms, footpaths and secret crawlspaces. Players are guided through the house by expository voice narration from Edith Finch herself, her words visually displayed to the player as part of the scene in a manner to direct the player's attention. Through the house they encounter a series of memorials and shrines dedicated to deceased relatives. Players make progress by interacting with these shrines and experiencing the death of these family members (or embellished or fictionalized accounts thereof) in various forms, including [[flip book]]s, [[cutscene]]s, and first-person [[minigame]]s.

== Story ==
In the present, the player-character takes a ferry to [[Orcas Island]] off the coast of [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] with the journal of Edith Finch in their hands. As they wait, they read through the journal that describes Edith Finch Jr.'s last visit to her family's home on the island in 2016. 

Edith's writings explain that she is from the latest generation of the Finch family which has a perceived family curse going back at least five generations, in that all but one of the children of that generation die from unusual causes, leaving a sole child to continue the family. Her great-great-grandfather Odin, after losing his wife and their newborn child, tried to escape the curse by moving from Norway to the United States with his remaining daughter Edith "Edie" and her family, husband Sven and daughter Molly, in 1937. Odin insisted on bringing their home with them, tethered to their ship, but just off the shore of Orcas, high tidal waves capsized the house, and Odin drowned. The remaining family was safe, and they built a new home on Orcas, overlooking the ocean and within sight of the original house wreckage, while continuing to grow their family, giving birth to Barbara, twin brothers Calvin and Sam, and Walter. Edie also insisted they build a graveyard for their family nearby.

While the family enjoyed some normalcy for a while, with Edie believing they have avoided the curse, calamity soon hit. Molly died as a ten-year-old after ingesting toxic [[holly]] berries. Barbara was killed during an unsolved home invasion, and Walter became traumatized by her death, moving into a secret bunker below the house. Calvin died after falling off a rope swing into the ocean. Sven was killed while trying to construct a dragon-themed slide onto the house. Edie decided that to memorialize each death, they would make each of their bedrooms a shrine to them, and she would leave writings about their death, typically exaggerating the details to make the death seem more fantastical than it really was. For example, Edie described Sven's death as having died while fighting a dragon.

Sam eventually married Kay Carlisle, and they had their set of children, Dawn, Gus, and Gregory. Edie refused to repurpose the bedrooms in the Finch home, and instead they constructed additional stories atop the home for Sam and his family to move into. Gregory, as an infant, drowned in a bathtub when Kay became distracted from a call from Sam. Sam and Kay ended up divorcing. Sam married another woman but during the ceremony, Gus was killed by a fallen [[totem]] statue knocked over by a storm. Sam later was killed while on a hunting trip with Dawn, knocked off a cliff by a deer.

Once old enough, Dawn traveled to do humanitarian work in India where she met Sanjay Kumar, and the two married and had three children, Lewis, Milton, and Edith Jr. Following Sanjay's death, Dawn brought her family back to the Finch home. Milton, an aspiring artist, went missing,{{efn|Ian Dallas of Giant Sparrow asserts that Milton escaped into his artwork and became the king character of ''[[The Unfinished Swan]]'', the team's previous game.&lt;ref name="gamespot dev"/&gt;}} and caused Dawn to become paranoid. Dawn sealed off each of the memorial bedrooms from the outside, not wanting the other children learning of their past, though Edie insisted they leave a peephole in each door so that her great-grandchildren can know the family's history. Walter, who had been forgotten by all but Edie, decided to come out from the bunker via a new tunnel, but ended up being run over by a train, killing him. 

Lewis committed suicide in 2010, following an episode of derealization caused by drug withdrawal. On the night following his funeral, Dawn decided that the remaining Finches, herself, Edie, and Edith, must leave the home, but Edie refused. As Dawn and Edie argued, Edith went to the home's library to find Edie's own journal of their family history. Before she could read it, Dawn tore the journal from her hands against Edie's wishes. Dawn and Edith left immediately that night, leaving all their belongings behind and having made arrangements for a nursing home to pick up Edie the next day. However, by the time the nursing home's van arrived, Edie had gone missing.

Roughly six years later, Dawn eventually succumbed to an illness. In her will, she left Edith a key to the Finch home, leading Edith to travel back there, and explore the house while writing her journal. Edith discovered the key helped to unlock several secret passages between each of the sealed-off bedrooms, which she believes were constructed by Edie in the house's original design, and discovered by Milton which led to him to find a way to escape the family curse. Edith wrote her own thoughts and eulogies to the departed family in her journal. She eventually reached her own old bedroom, and wrote to her yet-born child that she carried, hoping her journal will help them understand their family's lineage.

In the present, the player-character is revealed to be Edith's son Christopher and the sole-surviving Finch, Edith having died from complications at childbirth. Debarking the ferry, he travels to the Finch home and places flowers at the newly-constructed gravestone for Edith.

''What Remains of Edith Finch'' is the second game developed by the team at [[Giant Sparrow]], led by creative director Ian Dallas, with their debut effort being the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]-award-winning ''[[The Unfinished Swan]]''. The concept of the game grew out from trying to create something sublime, as described by Dallas, "an interactive experience that evokes what it feels like to have a moment of finding something beautiful, yet overwhelming". Dallas embodied this concept by using his own experience as a scuba diver while he had lived in Washington State, and seeing the ocean fall off into darkness into the distance.&lt;ref name="gamespot dev"/&gt; The game initially was based on this scuba diving approach, but this created a number of problems with conveying narrative. While the game was in this state, they came up with the idea of using floating text captions of the narrative to be seen by the player, which remained as a key gameplay element through the game's ongoing changes.&lt;ref name="pcgamer making"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/the-making-of-what-remains-of-edith-finch/ | title = The making of What Remains of Edith Finch | first = Chris | last = Shilling | date = June 2, 2018 | accessdate = November 6, 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team struggled on the diver idea until Dallas came up with the idea of a shark falling into a forest with a child uttering the line "and suddenly I was a shark", which sparked the idea of moving into more strange and unnatural scenarios; this specific one would eventually become the mini-experience for Molly, the first bedroom the player explores in the game.&lt;ref name="pcgamer making"/&gt; While the Molly scenario was fleshed out further, the team broke out to develop other scenarios that captured the same sense, giving the player something interesting to watch or do but knowing that their characters were about to die, creating the type of experience they wanted to evoke.&lt;ref name="gamespot dev"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-remains-of-edith-finch-dev-discusses-the-game/1100-6449846/ | title = What Remains of Edith Finch Dev Discusses The Game's Ending | first= Matt | last =Espineli | date = May 7, 2017 | accessdate = November 6, 2018 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pcgamer making"/&gt;

[[File:Edith_finch_house_screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|The Finch's home, with new additions built atop it in a seemingly haphazard manner. The game guides the player by presenting the voice-over narration as text within the game's setting.]]
To link these mini-experiences, they had to come up with a framing device. Initially, they considered a scenario similar to ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' but set in a modern-day high school,&lt;ref name="gamespot dev"/&gt; but soon recognized that placing these deaths in context of a cursed family would work better, forming an [[anthology]] work like ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', while borrowing concepts from the novel ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'' which similarly involved the overlapping stories of various family members.&lt;ref name="pcgamer making"/&gt; With this approach set, the team then only had to determine the genealogical nature of this family and how the house should be styled.&lt;ref name="gamespot dev"/&gt; For the house itself, Dallas stated they had three words they worked from, sublime, intimate and murky. Their goal was to make the house itself feel like "a natural force. It begins to look almost like the bark of a tree; something that has an order to it, but it’s too chaotic for us to be able to follow."&lt;ref name="pcgamer making"/&gt; While they had designed all the bedrooms in roughly the same order the player experienced them in the game, it was not until the second-to-last bedroom, that of Lewis who had been into [[marijuana]] use, that they realized that these bedrooms can be used to say much more about each family member by how they were decorated. Lewis' had been heavily decorated with posted and other items that indicated his drug addiction, and the team realized this shared a lot about his character they did not have to communicate via narration or the death sequence. Major changes were made to all the previous bedrooms to provide similar expository elements for each character over the last few months of release.&lt;ref name="gdc2018"/&gt;

{{external media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0O9JSu9BzY Greenlight trailer for ''What Remains of Edith Finch'']}}
The team also recognized that from some of these mini-experiences they created, they wanted to leave them open-ended as to exactly what happened, following the convention of [[weird fiction]] to leave the player questioned if the mini-experiences they had played through were grounded in reality or not.&lt;ref name="gamespot dev"/&gt; They did not want to make a [[Horror fiction|horror]] game, where their purpose would be to intentionally scare the player, but wanted to borrow concepts common in the horror genre, such as [[H. P. Lovecraft|Lovecraftian]] elements. The game had started out titled ''The Nightmares of Edith Finch'', and its greenlight trailer has a spookier nature to it, such as the protagonist exploring the house mostly in the dark with a flashlight, but the team eventually backed off on these elements to leave the more eerie elements, remaining the game to its final title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/317087/Take_a_look_back_at_some_of_the_early_concepts_for_What_Remains_of_Edith_Finch.php | title = Take a look back at some of the early concepts for What Remains of Edith Finch | first= Alissa | last =McAloon | date = April 26, 2018 | accessdate = November 8, 2018 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's ending was considered the most difficult part for the team, according to Dallas, as they did not know if they should end the game on a mini-experience that elevated the sense of unease from previous ones. Eventually, they opted to go with something completely different, a closure on the story that was intended to give time for the player to reflect on what they had just played through.&lt;ref name="gamespot dev"/&gt; Dallas credits suggestions made by Dino Patti of [[Playdead]] and [[Jenova Chen]] of [[thatgamecompany]], following a playtest of the game, of inspiring the pregnancy and childbirth facets to close out the story after all the death that they had experienced.&lt;ref name="gdc2018"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1025016/Weaving-13-Prototypes-into-1 | title = Weaving 13 Prototypes into 1 Game: Lessons from 'Edith Finch' | first = Ian | last = Dallas | date = March 21, 2018 | accessdate = November 9, 2018 | publisher = [[Game Developers Conference]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an unusual move, the player is able to look down at Edith's body and see her belly, hinting about her pregnancy. Though Dallas had not wanted to have the player see parts of the character's body, their tech artist Chelsea Hash insisted on keeping this in, which Dallas found later to be a pleasant surprise for players that discovered this on their own.&lt;ref name="pcgamer making"/&gt;

The game had been in development since at least 2013, when Giant Sparrow partner with [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], and was first announced with an on-stage trailer at the 2014 [[PlayStation Experience]] event as a title to be published by [[SIE Santa Monica Studio|SCE Santa Monica Studio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2014/12/06/introducing-what-remains-of-edith-fitch-a-new-ps4-exclusive/|title=Introducing What Remains of Edith Finch, a New PS4 Exclusive|website=PlayStation.Blog|access-date=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a subsequent trailer released prior to [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=PlayStation|title=What Remains of Edith Finch – House Introduction Trailer {{!}} PS4|date=2015-05-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc_2NOLQNIg|accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interim, Sony started to wane on its support for independently-developed video games, and Santa Monica Studios dropped the title from its lineup. However, several of those that had been at Santa Monica Studios and working with Giant Sparrow on a daily basis for ''What Remains of Edith Finch'' left the studio to form [[Annapurna Interactive]], which then became the game's new publisher.&lt;ref name="pcgamer making"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/games/annapurna-pictures-video-game-megan-ellison-1201931131/|title=Megan Ellison's Annapurna Pictures Launches Video Game Division|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2016-12-01|newspaper=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annapurna relaxed some of the deadlines that Sony had originally had for the title, allowing Giant Sparrow to keep and refine some of the more significant mini-experiences they created that they would have otherwise had to cut under a tighter schedule. These included Gregory's, his drowning sequence set to "The Waltz of the Flowers" from ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], and Lewis', a mini-adventure game taking place in Lewis' mind while at the same time decapitating fish at a cannery that was inspired by "The Coronation of Mr. Thomas Shap" from ''[[The Book of Wonder]]''.&lt;ref name="pcgamer making"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcv"/&gt; Gregory's story was particularly one of concern since it involved the death of an infant, which raised concerns with their publisher. To help alleviate these, Giant Sparrow specifically brought in parents to help playtest as to make sure the story handled the topic in a sensitive manner.&lt;ref name="mcv"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.mcvuk.com/development/when-we-made-what-remains-of-edith-finch | title = When we made... What Remains of Edith Finch | first = Jem | last = Alexander | date = June 18, 2018 | accessdate = November 8, 2018 | work = [[The Market for Computer &amp; Video Games]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most-changed stories was Walter's. Originally, once in the bunker, Walter would have experienced still people that moved when he looked away, similar to ''[[Doctor Who]]''{{'}}s [[Weeping Angel]]s or ''[[The Prisoner]]'', and then would imaging himself living on a model trainset where an invisible hand would move pieces around on the set. Both aspects were to represent the passage of time for the decades Walter lived there, and out of paranoia, Walter would then escape through the tunnel and to his demise. This was ultimately trimmed down to showing Walter going through the same routine each day, eating peaches from a can, until one day he decides to escape.&lt;ref name="pcgamer making"/&gt; Another scrapped idea for the game was to bring in [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] to compose a song about Edie. Inspired by the story of [[Harry R. Truman]], a man that had stubbornly refused to leave his home prior to the [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|eruption of Mount St. Helens]], the team had envisioned a scenario that Edie would have also refused to leave her family home despite the threat of a nearby forest fire sometime in the 1980s. With this concept, her story made national news and made her a national icon which, in the timeline, Yankovic would have made a song about her that would have been included as part of Edie's story. However, this idea came too late in the development without enough time to follow up on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-08-21-what-remains-of-edith-finch-dev-wanted-weird-al-yankovic-in-the-game | title = What Remains of Edith Finch creator wanted Weird Al Yankovic in the game | first = Jeffrey | last = Matulef | date = August 21, 2017 | accessdate = November 6, 2018 | work = [[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Composer [[Jeff Russo]], whose previous works include the soundtracks to the ''[[Fargo (TV series)|Fargo]]'' TV series, ''[[The Night Of]]'', and ''[[Power (TV series)|Power]]'', composed the soundtrack for ''What Remains of Edith Finch''. For Barbara's sequence, which is played out in the pages of a comic book styled after ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', Dallas had Rosso to try to create a soundtrack similar to the theme from [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]''. Dallas had considered asking Carpenter to narrate this section, but at the time, the [[2016–17 video game voice actor strike|video game voice actor strike]] was ongoing, making this impossible, but Carpenter did agree to license the use of the ''Halloween'' theme for this sequence.&lt;ref name="pcgamer making"/&gt;

''What Remains of Edith Finch'' received "generally positive" reviews, according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MCPC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPS4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCXONE"/&gt;

''[[Destructoid]]''{{'}}s Brett Makedonski scored the game a 9/10 with the consensus "A hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage."&lt;ref name="Destruct"/&gt;

Marty Sliva's 8.8/10 score on [[IGN]] stated that "''What Remains of Edith Finch'' is a gorgeous experience and one of the finest magical-realism stories in all of games."&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;
 
Andy Chalk's gave a score of 91 out of 100 on ''[[PC Gamer]]'' and said it was "Touching, sad, and brilliant; a story worth forgiving the limited interactivity to experience."&lt;ref name="PCGUS"/&gt;

Josh Harmon of [[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGMNow]] awarded it 7/10, stating that "''Edith Finch'' is "a brilliant accomplishment. It's also a game that repeatedly fails to live up to its potential in serious, heartbreaking ways. Until now, I'd never realized it was possible to be both at the same time."&lt;ref name="EGM"/&gt;

Griffin Vacheron from [[Game Revolution]] gave the game a score of 3.5 stars out of 5, saying that "If you're more like me, though, and deviate from the assessment of tragic events as an inherently higher form, then you may find the Finch's tale doesn't activate your almonds as much as it probably should. Still, as a spooky, logical evolution of the Gone Homes and Firewatches of the world, with an impressive short-story style to boot, ''What Remains of Edith Finch'' is ultimately worth your time if its premise grabs you."&lt;ref name="GameRev"/&gt;

"In ''What Remains of Edith Finch'', death is a certainty and life is the surprise. Its stories are enchanting, despite their unhappy ends. I was sad I never had the chance to know the Finches while they were alive, but thankful for the opportunity, however brief, to learn a bit about them. The final farewell left me crying, but ''What Remains of Edith Finch'' is, without doubt, love," was Susan Arendt's conclusion on ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' with a score of 9/10.&lt;ref name="Poly"/&gt;

Colm Ahern's score of 9/10 on VideoGamer.com said that "First-person, narrative-driven games generally follow a pattern. What Remains of Edith Finch plays with those established conventions to create a beautiful story that breaks your heart, while making you smile just as much. A triumph in the genre."&lt;ref name="VG"/&gt;

The '''Women's Environment &amp; Development Organization''' ('''WEDO''') is an international [[non-governmental organization]] based in [[New York City]], [[United States|U.S.]] that advocates [[women's rights|women's equality]] in global policy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wedo.org/about-us-2/|title=HerStory - WEDO|website=wedo.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1990 by [[Bella Abzug]] and [[Mim Kelber]] to take action in the [[United Nations]] and other international policymaking forums. Its early successes included achieving gender [[sexual equality|equality]] in the final documents of [[Agenda 21]] and the [[Rio Declaration]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2006, the organization was named as an international [[Champions of the Earth|Champion of the Earth]] by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The mission of WEDO is to ensure that women's rights, the social, economic and environmental justice, and sustainable development principles (and the links between them) are invested at the heart of global/national policies, the programs initiated and practices established.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wedo.org/about-us-2/vision-mission-2/|title=Vision &amp; Mission - WEDO|website=wedo.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way that WEDO is approaching these issues of environmental change is by addressing those complex environmental problems by incorporating women's humans rights to secure sustainable development for future generations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There are two main goals of the Women's Environment and Development Organization: to make sure women feel empowered enough to claim their rights as advocates and leaders (especially on certain problems related to the environment) and to develop sustainable development policies and plans that are gender-responsive and socially just and are implemented in a way that is effective.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

WEDO and the [[Center for Women's Global Leadership]] launched the [[Gender Equality Architecture Reform]] (GEAR) Campaign in February 2008 to mobilize women's groups and allies to push for the adoption of the new UN entity for gender equality and women's empowerment.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.un-ngls.org/IMG/pdf_ROUNDUP.2.pdf
 |title=Strengthening the UN Gender Architecture: New Momentum behind Gender equality and the empowerment of women
 |work=RoundUp
 |accessdate=2011-09-25
 |date=March 2010
 |publisher=[[United Nations Non-Governmental Liaison Service]] (NGLS).}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center for Women's Global Leadership is a non-governmental organization that works on policy and advocacy and to facilitate women's leadership worldwide.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; To be able to advocate for women in the UN, together WEDO and the Center for Women's Global Leadership brought 50 activists together from all around the world to develop comprehensive strategies to gain the UN's approval of a fully resourced women's entity in the UN.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

WEDO focuses its work in three programmatic areas: Gender &amp; Governance, Sustainable Development, and Economic &amp; Social Justice. Priority projects include MisFortune500.org, climate change advocacy, and UN Reform.

== Climate policy ==
There is agreement that climate change does threaten to set back the efforts that have taken decades to put in place, placing least developed countries and vulnerable populations in an even more precarious position.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wedo.org/what-we-do/our-focus-areas/climate-change/|title=Climate Policy - WEDO|website=wedo.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC AR5 concluded with more than 95% certainty, that humans have caused most of the climate change since the 1950s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Climate change erodes human freedom and limits choice.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although the impact of climate change affects everyone, only certain area will feel the most impact from this occurring. Those with the fewest resources, be it countries or individuals, will feel the impact of the changes the most and those that are wealthy will reap the benefits of a low-carbon society as the economy shifts towards that route.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There is a lot of intersectionality when thinking of climate policy and climate changes. Climate change impacts solutions and encompasses a large diversity of experiences due to age, ethnicity, class, and especially, gender.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Women, in comparison to men, have limited voices, more restricted rights, and limited access to resources.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

WEDO is calling for a global pathway to save the planet, a commitment to stay away from a fossil fuel based economy, have adequate climate finance for developing countries, have gender quality respected in all climate action, phase-out harmful technologies, and have women's leadership in all aspects of the decision-making.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Sustainable cities and transport ==
Sustainable cities are safe, ensure access to resources, and provide economic opportunities for all.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wedo.org/what-we-do/our-focus-areas/sustainable-cities-transport/|title=Sustainable Cities &amp; Transport - WEDO|website=wedo.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inclusive actions at a local level that promotes gender equality and women's rights in a sustainable development frame for all.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; WEDO also wants to ensure a capacity building of city officials on women's humans rights and policy design at a local level, want a rights-based framework, and macroeconomic policies to increase equity through progressive tax reforms.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

WEDO believes that sustainable development and gender equality should be pursued to address gender-differentiated needs- to make sure transportation, infrastructure, policy development, and environmental sustainability respond to everyone at every stage in their lives.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Disaster risk reduction ==
[[Disaster risk reduction]] (DRR) is to reduce disasters and their risks. It wants to build resilient people, men and women alike, and reduce vulnerability and build on the strengths and knowledge of people.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wedo.org/what-we-do/our-focus-areas/disaster-risk-reduction/|title=Disaster Risk Reduction - WEDO|website=wedo.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender roles limit women and girls with resilience for themselves and their families, while the protection mechanisms and law can affect them the most.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  WEDO wants gender analysis (use of gender-specific data to understand disaster risk), allocation of resources (gender-responsive research and training), understanding and action (protecting women's rights throughout the entire process), accountability (private sector investments and funding), and funding to go directly to women's organizations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2132">A '''women-only bank''' is a financial institution catering exclusively to women.

==Development==
In 2001, [[Dubai Islamic Bank]] opened a women-only bank branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1066760.stm | date = 2 January 2001 |title = Women-only bank in Gulf | publisher = BBC | first=Julia |last=Wheeler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran opened such a bank in [[Mashhad]] on June 7, 2010. The bank's director stated, "the aim is not [[sex segregation]] but respect for women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-07-02/iran-s-bank-melli-to-expand-women-only-branch-network.html |title=Iran's Bank Melli to Expand Women Only Branch Network |magazine=Businessweek |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316200923/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-07-02/iran-s-bank-melli-to-expand-women-only-branch-network.html |archivedate=March 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Iran's Bank Melli to Expand Women-Only Branches to All Provincial Capitals | first=Ali |last=Sheikholeslami |date = 2 July 2010| publisher = Bloomberg L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government-owned bank is [[Bank Melli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.forbes.com/2010/06/10/women-only-banking-iran-bank-melli-forbes-woman-net-worth-financial-discrimination.html | title = A Women-Only Bank For America | first=Joan Indiana |last=Rigdon | date= 10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Saudi Arabia]], most banks have some sort of women-only branch within the main branch. Not necessarily all branches and banks have this. Albeit the main branch can usually be accessed by both men and women.

The '''World Wide Fund for Nature''' ('''WWF''') is an [[Internationalism (politics)|international]] [[non-governmental organization]] founded in 1961, working in the field of the wilderness preservation, and the reduction of [[human impact on the environment]]. It was formerly named the '''World Wildlife Fund''', which remains its official name in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. The [[Living Planet Report]] is published every two years by WWF since 1998; it is based on a [[Living Planet Index]] and [[ecological footprint]] calculation. 

It is the world's largest [[environmental organization|conservation organization]] with over five million supporters  worldwide, working in more than 100 countries, supporting around 1,300&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/project/|title=WWF conservation projects around the world|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; conservation and environmental projects.  They have invested over $1 billion in more than 12,000 conservation initiatives since 1995.  &lt;ref name="WorldWildLife"&gt;{{cite web|title=WWF - Endangered Species Conservation|url=https://www.worldwildlife.org|website=World Wildlife Fund|accessdate=April 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; WWF is a foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How is WWF run? |url=http://wwf.panda.org/who_we_are/organization/  |accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with 55% of funding from individuals and bequests, 19% from government sources (such as the [[World Bank]], [[Department for International Development|DFID]], [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]]) and 8% from corporations in 2014.&lt;ref name="WWF-INT Annual Review"&gt;{{cite book |title = WWFN-International Annual Review|year = 2014|publisher = World Wide Fund for Nature|url = http://d2ouvy59p0dg6k.cloudfront.net/downloads/ar2014_v13_final_lr_sp.pdf|accessdate = 2015-09-17|page = 37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group aims to "stop the degradation of the planet’s natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature."&lt;ref name=quickfacts/&gt; Currently, their work is organized around these six areas: food, climate, freshwater, wildlife, forests, and oceans.&lt;ref name="WorldWildLife" /&gt;

== The Conservation Foundation ==
'''The Conservation Foundation''', a precursor to WWF, was founded in 1948 by [[Henry Fairfield Osborn, Jr.|Fairfield Osborn]] as an affiliate of the New York Zoological Society (today known as the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]]) with an aim of protecting the world's natural resources. The advisory council included leading scientists such as [[Charles Sutherland Elton]], [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]], [[Aldo Leopold]], [[Carl Sauer]], and [[Paul Sears]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=97juQSbKZhQC&amp;pg=RA1-PT280|page=280|title=Conservation and Environmentalism: An Encyclopedia|last=Paehlke|first=Robert C|author-link=Robert C. Paehlke|date=2013|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; It supported much of the scientific work cited by [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'', including that of [[John L. George (biologist)|John L. George]], [[Roger Hale]], [[Robert Rudd]], and [[George Woodwell]]. 

Dutch [[Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld]] helped found the World Wildlife Fund, becoming its first President in 1961, and in 1970 established the WWF's [[financial endowment]] "[[The 1001: A Nature Trust]]". He resigned his post after being involved in the [[Lockheed Bribery Scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary: HRH Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1478171/HRH-Prince-Bernhard-of-the-Netherlands.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=30 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108050115/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1478171/HRH-Prince-Bernhard-of-the-Netherlands.html|archivedate=8 November 2008|date=4 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the Foundation held a conference and published a major report warning of [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[global warming]], written by [[Noel Eichhorn]] based on the work of [[Frank Fraser Darling]] (then foundation vice president), [[Edward Deevey]], [[Erik Eriksson (scientist)|Erik Eriksson]], [[Charles Keeling]], [[Gilbert Plass]], [[Lionel Walford]], and [[William Garnett (photographer)|William Garnett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001495147|title=Implications of Rising Carbon Dioxide Content of the Atmosphere: A statement of trends and implications of carbon dioxide research reviewed at a conference of scientists|date=1963|place=New York |publisher=The Conservation Foundation|last=Eichhorn|first=Noel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the Conservation Foundation was merged into WWF, after becoming an affiliate of WWF in 1985, when&lt;!-- When 1990 or 1985 ? This reverse order of years is confusing too, please fix if you know what "when" refers to. --&gt; it became a distinct legal entity but with the same staff and board. The organization now known as the Conservation Foundation in the United States is the former [[The Conservation Foundation (Illinois)|Forest Foundation of DuPage County]].&lt;ref name="wwfhistory" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconservationfoundation.org/page.php?PageID=2|title=The Conservation Foundation|website=theconservationfoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morges Manifesto ==
The idea for a fund on behalf of endangered animals was officially proposed by [[Victor Stolan]] to [[Julian Huxley|Sir Julian Huxley]] in response to articles he published in the British newspaper ''[[The Observer]]''. This proposal led Huxley to put Stolan in contact with [[Max Nicholson]], a person who had had thirty years experience of linking [[progressivism|progressive]] intellectuals with [[big business]] interests through the [[Political and Economic Planning]] [[think tank]].&lt;ref name="WWF history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwf.panda.org/who_we_are/history/sixties/ |title=WWF in the 60s |publisher=World Wide Fund for Nature |date= |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kellaway"&gt;Kate Kellaway (7 November 2010).

The launching of a new ark: first report of the President and Trustees of the World Wildlife Fund, an international foundation for saving the world's wildlife and wild places; 1962-1965 (Collins).&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholson thought up the name of the organization. WWF was conceived on 29 April 1961, under the name of ''World Wildlife Fund'', and its first office was opened on 11 September that same year in [[Morges]], Switzerland. WWF was conceived to act as a funding institution for existing conservation groups such as the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature|International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] and The Conservation Foundation.&lt;ref name="wwfhistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/about/history|title=History - WWF|website=World Wildlife Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Godfrey A.

== Later history ==

WWF has set up offices and operations around the world. It originally worked by fundraising and providing grants to existing non-governmental organizations, based on the best-available scientific knowledge and with an initial focus on the protection of [[endangered species]]. As more resources became available, its operations expanded into other areas such as the preservation of [[Extinction|biological diversity]], sustainable use of [[natural resources]], the reduction of [[pollution]], and [[climate change]]. The organization also began to run its own conservation projects and campaigns, and by the 1980s started to take a more strategic approach to its conservation activities.

In 1986, the organization changed its name to ''World Wide Fund for Nature'', while retaining the WWF initials. However, it continued at that time to operate under the original name in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name=quickfacts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panda.org/wwf_quick_facts.cfm|title=WWF in Brief|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That year was the 25th anniversary of WWF's foundation, an event marked by a gathering in Assisi, Italy to which the organization's International President HRH Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, invited religious authorities representing Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam and Judaism. These leaders produced The Assisi Declarations, theological statements showing the spiritual relationship between their followers and nature that triggered a growth in the engagement of those religions with conservation around the world.&lt;ref&gt;WWF Archive website [http://wwf.panda.org/who_we_are/history/eighties/ who_we_are–history–eighties] retrieved June 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, WWF revised its mission statement to:
{{quote|Stop the degradation of the planet's natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature, by:
* conserving the world's biological diversity;
* ensuring that the use of renewable natural resources is sustainable; [and]
* promoting the reduction of pollution and wasteful consumption.}}

WWF scientists and many others identified 238 [[ecoregions]] that represent the world's most biologically outstanding [[earth|terrestrial]], [[freshwater]] and [[oceans|marine]] habitats, based on a worldwide biodiversity analysis which the organization says was the first of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/about/ |title=About global ecoregions |publisher=World Wide Fund for Nature |date= |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s (decade), its work was focused on a subset of these ecoregions, in the areas of forest, freshwater and marine [[habitat conservation]], endangered species conservation, climate change, and the elimination of the most toxic chemicals.

{{quote|"We shan't save all we should like to, but we shall save a great deal more than if we had never tried." – Sir [[Peter Scott]] &lt;ref name="WWF Finland"/&gt;}}
In 1996, the organization obtained general [[consultative status]] from [[UNESCO]].

== Panda symbol ==
[[File:Grosser Panda.JPG|thumb|The giant panda has become the symbol of WWF.]]

WWF's [[giant panda]] logo originated from a panda named [[Chi Chi (giant panda)|Chi Chi]] that had been transferred from [[Beijing Zoo]] to [[London Zoo]] in 1958, three years before WWF became established.  Being famous as the only panda residing in the Western world at that time, its uniquely recognisable physical features and status as an endangered species were seen as ideal to serve the organization's need for a strong recognisable symbol that would overcome all language barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/who_we_are/history/sixties/ |title=WWF - WWF in the 60's |publisher=WWF |date= |accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also needed an animal that would have an impact in black and white printing. The logo was then designed by [[Peter Scott (conservationist)|Sir Peter Scott]] from preliminary sketches by Gerald Watterson, a Scottish naturalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/who_we_are/history/sixties/|title=WWF in the 60's|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/finder/giantpanda/panda.html |title=WWF - Giant Panda - Overview |publisher=Worldwildlife.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo was slightly simplified and made more geometric in 1978, and was revised significantly again in 1986, at the time that the organization changed its name, with the new version featuring solid black shapes for eyes.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.logodesignlove.com/world-wildlife-fund World Wildlife Fund logo sketches]".

== 21st century ==

WWF's strategy for achieving its mission specifically concentrates on restoring populations of 36 [[species]] (species or species groups that are important for their [[ecosystem]] or to people, including [[elephant]]s, [[tuna]]s, [[Cetacea|whales, dolphins and porpoises]]), and [[ecological footprint]] in 6 areas (carbon emissions, cropland, grazing land, fishing, forestry and water).{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The organization also works on a number of [[global issue]]s driving biodiversity loss and unsustainable use of natural resources, including finance, business practices, laws, and consumption choices. Local offices also work on national or regional issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panda.org/what_we_do/ |title=What does the World Wild Life Fund do? |publisher=World Wide Fund for Nature |date= |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WWF works with a large number of different groups to achieve its goals, including other NGOs, governments, business, investment banks, scientists, fishermen, farmers and local communities. It also undertakes public campaigns to influence decision makers, and seeks to educate people on how to live in a more environmentally friendly manner.It urges people to donate funds to protect the environment. The donors can also choose to receive gifts in return.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

== Publications ==

WWF publishes the ''[[Living Planet Index]]'' in collaboration with the [[Zoological Society of London]]. Along with [[ecological footprint]] calculations, the ''Index'' is used to produce a bi-yearly ''[[Living Planet Report]]'' giving an overview of the impact of human activity on the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panda.org/about_our_earth/all_publications/living_planet_report/ |title=Living Planet Report |publisher=World Wide Fund for Nature |date= |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization also regularly publishes reports, fact sheets and other documents on issues related to its work, to raise awareness and provide information to policy and decision makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panda.org/about_our_earth/all_publications/|title=Publication &amp; Resources|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policy-making===
Policies of the WWF are made by board members elected for three-year terms. An Executive Team guides and develops WWF's strategy. There is also a National Council which stands as an advisory group to the board and a team of scientists and experts in conservation who research for WWF.

National and international law plays an important role in determining how habitats and resources are managed and used. Laws and regulations become one of the organization’s global priorities.

The WWF has been opposed to the extraction of oil from the Canadian [[tar sands]] and has campaigned on this matter. Between 2008 and 2010 the WWF worked with [[The Co-operative Group]], the [[UK]]'s largest [[consumer co-operative]] to publish reports which concluded that: (1) exploiting the Canadian tar sands to their full potential would be sufficient to bring about what they described as 'runaway climate change;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.co-operative.coop/upload/ToxicFuels/docs/WWF_CFS_Unconventionals_report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708080954/http://www.co-operative.coop/upload/ToxicFuels/docs/WWF_CFS_Unconventionals_report.pdf |archivedate=8 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2) carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology cannot be used to reduce the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to a level comparable to that of other methods of oil extraction;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.co-operative.coop/upload/ToxicFuels/docs/CCS-in-the-Alberta-oil-sands-a-dangerous-myth.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923205501/http://www.co-operative.coop/upload/ToxicFuels/docs/CCS-in-the-Alberta-oil-sands-a-dangerous-myth.pdf |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (3) the $379 billion which is expected to be spent extracting oil from [[tar sands]] could be better spent on research and development in renewable energy technology;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.co-operative.coop/upload/ToxicFuels/docs/opportunity-cost-report.pdf |title=Opportunity cost of tar sands development |work=co-operative.coop |accessdate=25 September 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906001129/https://www.co-operative.coop/upload/ToxicFuels/docs/opportunity-cost-report.pdf |archivedate=September 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and (4) the expansion of tar sands extraction poses a serious threat to the caribou in Alberta .&lt;ref&gt;http://www.co-operative.coop/upload/ToxicFuels/docs/caribou-report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization convinces and helps governments and other political bodies to adopt, enforce, strengthen and/or change policies, guidelines and laws that affect biodiversity and natural resource use. It also ensures government consent and/or keeps their commitment to international instruments relating to the protection of biodiversity and natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/how_we_work/tackling_the_causes/|title=Tackling the Causes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/how_we_work/policy/|title=Advocacy &amp; policy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, David Nussbaum, Chief Executive of WWF-UK, spoke out against the way [[shale gas]] is used in the UK, saying: "...the Government must reaffirm its commitment to tackling climate change and prioritise renewables and energy efficiency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securingthefuture.co.uk/energy/12572-take-foot-off-the-pedal-on-shale-gas-charities-warn-government|title='Take foot off the pedal on shale gas', charities warn Government|first=Scott|last=Buckler|website=www.securingthefuture.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

===Corporate partnerships===

WWF has been accused by the campaigner [[Corporate Watch]] of being too close to business to campaign objectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corporatewatch.org/?lid=1873 |title=PANDA-ING TO THE SOYA BARONS? |author= |date=2009-09-30 |work= |publisher=Corporate Watch |accessdate=2009-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/2009/apr/02/greenwash-ikea-diy-earth-hour |title=Ikea – you can't build a green reputation with a flatpack DIY manual |author=Fred Pearce |date=2009-04-02 |work= |publisher=Guardian UK |accessdate=2009-12-09 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; WWF claims partnering with corporations such as [[Coca-Cola]], [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]], [[Carlos Slim]]'s and [[IKEA]] will reduce their effect on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panda.org/what_we_do/how_we_work/businesses/ |title=Changing the nature of business |publisher=World Wide Fund for Nature|date= |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WWF received €56 million (US$80 million) from corporations in 2010 (an 8% increase in support from corporations compared to 2009), accounting for 11% of total revenue for the year.&lt;ref name="WWF-INT Annual Review"/&gt;

===Project "Lock"===
In 1988, Prince Bernhard, previously WWF's first President, sold paintings for [[Pound sterling|GBP]]&amp;nbsp;700,000 to raise money for the World Wildlife Fund. The money was deposited in a Swiss WWF bank account. In 1989, Charles de Haes, then WWF Director-General, transferred GBP&amp;nbsp;500,000 back to Bernhard for what he (de Haes) called a "private project". It was then revealed, in 1991, that Prince Bernhard had used the money to hire KAS International, owned by [[Special Air Service|SAS]] founder [[David Stirling]], for an operation called Project "Lock" during which [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] (mostly British) fought [[Poaching|poachers]] in nature reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/pretoria-inquiry-confirms-secret-battle-for-the-rhino-1324553.html |title=Pretoria inquiry confirms secret battle for the rhino |work=The Independent |date=18 January 1996 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mekong River dolphins report===
In June 2009, Touch Seang Tana, chairman of [[Cambodia]]'s Commission for Conservation and Development of the [[Mekong River]] Dolphins Eco-tourism Zone, argued that the WWF had misrepresented the danger of extinction of the [[Irrawaddy dolphin|Mekong dolphin]] to boost fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.cri.cn/6966/2009/06/24/2001s496246.htm |title=Cambodia Rejects CNN, WWF Reports about Mekong Dolphin |publisher=CRIEnglish.com |date=2009-06-24 |accessdate=2013-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report stated that the deaths were caused by a bacterial disease that became fatal due to environmental contaminants suppressing the dolphins' immune systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?167401/Mekong-dolphins-on-the-brink-of-extinction|title=Mekong dolphins on the brink of extinction|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called the report unscientific and harmful to the Cambodian government and threatened the WWF's Cambodian branch with suspension unless they met with him to discuss his claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://khmerization.blogspot.com/2009/06/cambodia-threatens-to-suspend-wwf-after.html |title=Cambodia threatens to suspend WWF after dolphin report |accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Touch Seang Tana later said he would not press charges of supplying false information and would not make any attempt to prevent WWF from continuing its work in Cambodia, but advised WWF to adequately explain its findings and check with the commission before publishing another report. After this, in January 2012, Touch Seang Tana signed the "Kratie Declaration on the Conservation of the Mekong River Irrawaddy Dolphin" along with WWF and the Cambodian Fisheries Administration, an agreement binding the parties to work together on a "roadmap" addressing dolphin conservation in the Mekong River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/authors-report-dolphins-will-not-face-charges-official-says|title=Authors of report on dolphins will not face charges official says|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pandaleaks===
In 2012, German investigative journalist Wilfried Huissmann published a book called "The Silence of the Pandas". It became a bestseller in [[Germany]], but was banned from Britain until 2014, when it was released under the title of "Pandaleaks", after a series of injunctions and court orders.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/04/wwf-international-selling-its-soul-corporations|title=WWF International accused of 'selling its soul' to corporations|first=John|last=Vidal|date=4 October 2014|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book criticizes WWF for its supposed involvement with corporations that are responsible for large-scale destruction of the environment, such as [[Coca-Cola]], and gives details into the existence of the secret [[1001 Club]], whose members, Huismann claims, continue to have an unhealthy influence on WWF's policy making.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; However, WWF has sought to deny the allegations made against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/press_releases/a_quick_guide_to_the_silence_of_the_pandas_documentary.cfm|title=A quick guide to the silence of the pandas documentary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ARD documentary===
{{Disputed-section|talk=Talk:World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature/Archive_1#ARD_documentary|date=July 2011}}
The German public television [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] aired a documentary on 22 June 2011 that claimed to show how the WWF cooperates with corporations such as [[Monsanto]], providing sustainability certification in exchange for donations{{nbsp}}– essentially [[greenwashing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Der Pakt mit dem Panda: Was uns der WWF verschweigt'' (Pact with the Panda: What the WWF conceals) |work=DasErste.de |publisher=tagesschau.de ARD |date=22 June 2011 |url=http://www.ardmediathek.de/ard/servlet/content/3517136?documentId=7495082 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728032810/http://www.ardmediathek.de/ard/servlet/content/3517136?documentId=7495082 |archive-date=28 July 2011 |accessdate=2011-07-25}} See also: [http://programm.ard.de/TV/Programm/Sender/?sendung=281117723794509 program overview for rebroadcast], 2&amp;nbsp;April 2012, programm.ARD.de, noting the objections raised by WWF supporters after the initial broadcast, and retracting two claims made in the film; retrieved 2017-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt; WWF has denied the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WWF-Mitarbeiter treffen Chief Kasimirus Sangara |last=WWF |url=http://www.wwf.de/themen/huismann-kritik-pakt-mit-dem-panda-faktencheck |accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; By encouraging high-impact eco-tourism, the program alleges that WWF contributes to the destruction of habitat and species it claims to protect. WWF-India is not active at the tiger reserve given as the example,{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} but it is active elsewhere seeking to limit adverse tourism effects and better sharing of tourism benefits to local communities. The program also alleges WWF certified a palm oil plantation operated by [[Wilmar International]], a Singaporean company, on the Indonesian island of [[Borneo]], even though the establishment of the plantation led to the destruction of over 14,000 hectares of rainforest. Only 80 hectares were ultimately conserved, the ARD documentary claims. According to the programme, two orangutans live on the conserved land, but have very slim chances of survival because no fruit trees remain and the habitat is too small to sustain them. To survive, they steal palm nuts from the neighbouring plantation, thereby risking being shot by plantation workers. WWF notes that the plantation filmed is PT Rimba Harapan Sakti, which has not been certified as a sustainable producer by the [[Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil]].

===Hunting===
The President of Honor of WWF in Spain used to be [[King Juan Carlos I]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Desde nuestros comienzos hasta hoy |last=WWF |url=http://www.wwf.es/wwf_adena/historia_y_logros/ |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has been a known hunting enthusiast. In 1962, when he was 24, he was invited by the German Baron Werner [[House of Alvensleben|von Alvensleben]] to a hunt in [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cazador blanco, sangre azul |last=WWF |url=http://www.publico.es/ciencias/238318/cazador-blanco-sangre-azul |accessdate=2012-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418152635/http://www.publico.es/ciencias/238318/cazador-blanco-sangre-azul |archivedate=18 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the king has taken part in hunting forays in [[Africa]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. In October 2004, he was a member of a hunt in [[Romania]] that killed a [[wolf]] and nine [[brown bear]]s, including one that was pregnant, according to the Romanian newspaper [[Romania Libera]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/01/23729b67-d43a-4711-89aa-afef9326c53c.html Romania: Elite Hunting Spree Sparks Calls For Better Animal Protection], ''[[RFE/RL]]'', 27 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He was also accused by a Russian official of killing a bear called Mitrofan, supposedly after giving vodka to the animal, in an episode that sparked controversy in Spain, although the claim was never proven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6070656.stm "Royal row over Russian bear fate"], [[BBC News]], 20 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, according to ''[[The Guardian]]'', the Polish government allowed him to kill a [[European bison]] in [[Białowieża Forest]], even though it is an [[endangered species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=King's bison shoot stirs anger of conservation groups |last=WWF |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2004/mar/24/conservationandendangeredspecies.internationalnews |accessdate=2012-04-15 |location=London |work=The Guardian |date=2004-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further controversy arose in April 2012 when the king's participation in an elephant hunt in [[Botswana]] was discovered only after he returned to Spain on an emergency flight after tripping over a step and fracturing his hip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=El Rey es operado tras romperse la cadera en un viaje de caza en Botsuana |last=WWF |url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/04/14/actualidad/1334391118_898284.html |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Spanish environmental groups and [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] parties criticized the monarch's hobby,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=La izquierda ve "una falta de respeto" en el viaje del rey a Botsuana |last=WWF |url=http://www.publico.es/espana/429497/la-izquierda-ve-una-falta-de-respeto-en-el-viaje-del-rey-a-botsuana |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the WWF stripped him of the honorary position in July 2012, in an extraordinary assembly by 94% of the votes of the members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/9417840/King-Juan-Carlos-of-Spain-ousted-from-WWF-presidency-after-row-over-hunting-trip.html |title=King no longer president |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2012-07-21 |accessdate=2012-08-19 |location=London |first=Martin |last=Roberts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The 1001: A Nature Trust ==
{{main|The 1001: A Nature Trust}}

In the early 1970s, Prince Bernhard, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] and a few associates set up [[The 1001: A Nature Trust]] to handle the WWF's administration and fund-raising. 1001 members each contributed $10,000 to the trust.&lt;ref name="WWF Finland"&gt;{{en icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20100715155311/http://www.wwf.fi/english/international/history WWF Finland - History of WWF International]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Initialism dispute ==
{{see also|WWE#Legal disputes and controversies}}

In 2000, the World Wide Fund for Nature sued the [[World Wrestling Federation]] (now named [[WWE]]) for unfair trade practices. Both parties had shared the initials "WWF" since 1979. The conservation organization claimed that the [[professional wrestling]] company had violated a 1994 agreement regarding international use of the WWF initials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3_1038611 InternetNews Realtime IT News – Wildlife Fund Pins Wrestling Federation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114234625/http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3_1038611 |date=14 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://contracts.corporate.findlaw.com/agreements/wwf/worldwildlife.1997.01.20.html Text of the 1994 legal agreement with the World Wrestling Federation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013110155/http://contracts.corporate.findlaw.com/agreements/wwf/worldwildlife.1997.01.20.html |date=13 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 August 2001, a UK court ruled in favour of the World Wide Fund for Nature. The World Wrestling Federation filed an appeal in October 2001. However, on May 10, 2002, the World Wrestling Federation changed its [[Web address]] from ''WWF.com'' to ''WWE.com'', and replaced every "WWF" reference on the existing site with "WWE", as a prelude to changing the company's name to "World Wrestling Entertainment." Its stock ticker also switched from WWF to WWE.

The wrestling organization's abandonment of the "WWF" [[initialism]] did not end the two organizations' legal conflict. Later in 2002, the World Wide Fund for Nature petitioned the court for $360 million in damages, but was not successful. A subsequent request to overturn by the World Wide Fund for Nature was dismissed by the British [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] on June 28, 2007. In 2003, World Wrestling Entertainment won a limited decision which permitted them to continue marketing certain pre-existing products with the abandoned WWF logo. However, WWE was mandated to issue newly branded merchandise such as apparel, action figures, video games, and [[DVD]]s with the "WWE" initials. Additionally, the court order required the company to remove both auditory and visual references to "WWF" in its library of video footage outside the United Kingdom.

Starting with the 1,000th episode of ''Raw'' in July 2012, the WWF "scratch" logo is no longer censored in archival footage. In addition, the WWF initials are no longer censored when spoken or when written in plain text in archival footage.  In exchange, WWE is no longer permitted to use the WWF initials or logo in any new, original footage, packaging, or advertising, with any old-school logos for retro-themed programming now using a modification of the original WWF logo without the F.

== In music ==

''[[No One's Gonna Change Our World]]'' was a charity album released in 1969, for the benefit of the WWF.

[[Peter Rose and Anne Conlon]] are music theatre writers, well known for their environmental musicals for children, who were commissioned by WWF-UK to write several environmental musicals as part of an education plan. Some were narrated by [[David Attenborough]], and broadcast on television in numerous countries.

The British pop group [[S Club|S Club 7]] were ambassadors for WWF-UK during their time together as a band (1999-2003). Each of the members sponsored an endangered animal, and in 2000, traveled to the various locations around the world of their chosen animals for a seven-part [[BBC]] documentary series entitled ''[[S Club 7 Go Wild!|S Club 7 Go Wild]]''.

''Environmentally Sound: A Select Anthology of Songs Inspired by the Earth'' is a benefit album released in 2006, for WWF-Philippines, featuring artists that included [[Up Dharma Down]], [[Radioactive Sago Project]], [[Kala (band)|Kala]], [[Cynthia Alexander]], and [[Joey Ayala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The Harmonics of being Environmentally Sound|work=|publisher=[[World Wildlife Fund]] - Philippines|date=18 August 2006|url=http://www.wwf.org.ph/newsfacts.php?pg=det&amp;id=25|doi=|accessdate=2010-06-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720233747/http://www.wwf.org.ph/newsfacts.php?pg=det&amp;id=25|archivedate=20 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, WWF launched an online [[music download]] store with [[fairsharemusic]] from which 50% of the profit goes to the charity.

In April 2015, [[Hailey Gardiner]] released her solo EP, titled The Woods. In honor of [[Earth Day]], 15% of the proceeds made towards the purchase of the EP would be donated to the WWF.
