Above the line deductions are also known as "adjustments to income" and are shown on lines 23-36 of [[Form 1040]].

In the United States tax law, an '''above-the-line deduction''' is a deduction that the [[Internal Revenue Service]] allows a taxpayer to subtract from his or her [[gross income]] in arriving at "adjusted gross income" for the taxable year.  These deductions are set forth in Internal Revenue Code Section 62. A taxpayer's gross income minus his or her above-the-line deductions is equal to the [[adjusted gross income]].  Because these deductions are taken before [[adjusted gross income]] is calculated, they are designated "above-the-line."  Thus, those deductions allowed in computing "taxable income" under section 63 of the IRC are "below the line deductions" (thus, adjusted gross income represents "the line").  Above-the-line deductions may be more valuable to high income taxpayers than below-the-line deductions.

==Impact==
Above-the-line deductions are generally more advantageous for a high income taxpayer than so-called below-the-line deductions.  Below the line deductions are subtracted from a taxpayer's [[adjusted gross income]].  Above-the-line deductions may also be subject to income-sensitive phaseouts or limitations, e.g., MAGI limits on Tuition and Fees  deduction on line 34.  Certain below the line deductions are also phased out for high income taxpayers pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 68.  Medical and dental expenses are below the line deductions pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 67.  These expenses may only be deducted, however, to the extent they exceed 10% (7.5 % for 65 and over ) of a taxpayer's AGI. (&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/213&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, if a taxpayer had an adjusted gross income of $100,000 and medical expenses of $11,000, he or she would only be entitled to deduct the amount by which these expenses exceed 10% of $100,000, or $10,000.  Because these expenses exceed $10,000 by $1,000, the taxpayer is only entitled to a $1,000 deduction.
Above-the-line deductions are also preferred because they can be taken by ALL taxpayers regardless of whether they take standard or [[itemized deduction]]s (see attached tax ladder). Moreover, they are desirable because they reduce adjusted gross income (AGI). Generally, the smaller the AGI, the greater the percentage of deductibility of itemized deductions.

==List of the above-the-line deductions==

Internal Revenue Code Section 62(a)(1) allows above-the-line deductions for most ordinary and necessary business expenses which are attributable to a trade or business carried on by the taxpayer, if such trade or business does not consist of the performance of services by the taxpayer as an employee. I.R.C. 162(a). This includes reasonable allowance for salaries or other compensation for personal services rendered, traveling expenses (including amounts expended for meals and lodging other than amounts which are lavish or extravagant under the circumstances) while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business; and rentals or other payments required to be made as a condition to the continued use or possession, for purposes of the trade or business, of property to which the taxpayer has not taken or is not taking title or in which he has no equity.

Internal Revenue Code Sections 62 states that the following items are allowable as above-the-line deductions:

*Contribution to Traditional IRA  (Form 1040 Line 32)
*Certain expenses of performing artists  (Form 1040 Line 24)
*Certain expenses of state officials (162) (Form 1040 Line 24)
*Certain expenses for books and supplies incurred by teachers (162)  (Form 1040 Line 23)
*Certain expenses for Army Reserve members  (Form 1040 Line 24)
*Certain deductions of life tenants and income beneficiaries of property  
*Retirement plan savings for the self-employed (219) (Form 1040 Line28)
*Penalties forfeited because of premature withdrawal of funds  (Form 1040 Line 30)
*Alimony payments (215)  (Form 1040 Line 31a)
*Reforestation expenses
*Required repayments of supplemental unemployment compensation
*Jury duty pay given to the employer  (Form 1040 Line 36)
*Clean fuel vehicles (for tax years 2003-2006)
*Moving expenses (217)  (Form 1040 Line 26)
*Archer Medical Savings Accounts  
*Interest on student loans (221)  (Form 1040 Line 33)
*Higher Education expenses (222)  (Form 1040 Line 34)
*Health savings accounts (223)  (Form 1040 Line 25)
*Costs involving discrimination suits
*One-half of self-employment tax

See also IRS Publication 17.

==Formulas==
*Adjusted gross income (AGI) = Gross Income IRC (61)(a) − Above the line Deductions (62)(a)
*Taxable income = AGI − Personal Exemptions (151) − Standard Deduction 63(c) or Itemized Deductions 63(d)

'''Anonymous Internet banking''' is the proposed use of strong [[financial cryptography]] to make electronic [[bank secrecy]] (or more precisely [[pseudonymity|pseudonymous]] banking) possible. The bank issues currency in the form of electronic tokens that can be converted on presentation to the bank to some other currency. This concept has a long history in which [[free banking]] institutions have issued their own paper currency often backed by a physical commodity.

==History==
While the academic study of trust relationships and systems has long been the domain of [[intelligence services]] such as the [[NSA]], the growth of the Internet in the 1990s and the contemporary declassification of related knowledge allowed for greater public discussion of the potential for anonymous banking services by groups such as the [[Cryptoanarchy|cryptoanarchists]] and [[cypherpunk|cypherpunks]].

==The underlying mathematics==
Anonymous internet banking depends on the mathematics of [[public key cryptography]] and [[blind signature]] algorithms.  In this simple example we have [[Alice and Bob]] and a banker.  The banker generates an [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] public key with modulus &lt;math&gt;n= P Q&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are large [[Prime number|primes]], making &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; a [[semiprime]].  As described in [[RSA (algorithm)#Operation|RSA operation]], the bank also generates public key exponent &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and private key exponent &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

Bob asks the banker for a $100 [[deposit slip]] in anticipation of Alice wanting to transfer money to him.  To generate a deposit slip the bank selects a large, globally unique [[random number generation|random number]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and encrypts it using the bank's public key; this means that it can only be decrypted with the bank's secret key:

&lt;math&gt;R' = R^e\pmod n&lt;/math&gt;

This encrypted value &lt;math&gt;R'&lt;/math&gt; is sent to Bob with the promise to deposit $100 into his account when Bob sends the value &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; back to the bank.  The bank is confident that Bob won't be able to break RSA to generate &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;R'&lt;/math&gt; within a reasonable period without knowledge of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, so it does not worry about handing out the deposit slips without receiving anything from Bob.

When Alice wants to pay Bob $100 she asks for the deposit slip and Bob sends her &lt;math&gt;R'&lt;/math&gt;.  Alice selects a large random value &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; coprime with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (so as to have an inverse modulo &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) and uses it to blind &lt;math&gt;R''=w^e*R'&lt;/math&gt; and sends it to the bank to be blind signed.  The Bank charges Alice $100 for this operation and returns the blind signed value &lt;math&gt;R'''&lt;/math&gt;.  Due to the symmetric properties of RSA, this provides her with &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
R''' &amp; = (w^e*R')^d \pmod n \\
     &amp; = (w^e*R^e)^d \pmod n \\
     &amp; = (w*R)^{ed} \pmod n  \\
     &amp; = w * R \pmod n\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Because of the blinding process, the Bank is not able to associate &lt;math&gt;R''&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;R'''&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;R'&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. The only possible way for the bank to do this is to trial divide &lt;math&gt;R''&lt;/math&gt; by all the values of &lt;math&gt;R'&lt;/math&gt; that it gave out or &lt;math&gt;R'''&lt;/math&gt; by all values of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. This means the bank is unable to determine that Bob and Alice are doing business together, preserving the anonymity of the transaction.  Alice unblinds &lt;math&gt;R'''&lt;/math&gt; (by dividing it by &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;) to generate the original value &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, which she sends to Bob.
Bob verifies that &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; can be encrypted with the bank's public key by computing &lt;math&gt;R' = R^e \pmod n&lt;/math&gt;, which means that Alice has deposited $100 into the bank.  Bob then sends this value to the bank and the bank checks its records to be sure that &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; has not been already used. If &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is confirmed to be unused the bank then deposits $100 into Bob's account and updates its database that the unique value &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; has been redeemed.

Different public keys can be used for different denominations of currency so this system doesn't take appreciably longer for large transactions.

Note that if neither Alice nor Bob wishes the bank to know that they performed a transaction with each other, then it is hard for the bank to find out.  However, in order to ensure this is the case many people need to be making transactions at the same time.  Otherwise the bank can figure it out by the timing of the transactions, using [[traffic analysis]].

The '''''Bank guarantee case''''' or '''''Bürge''''' (19 October 1993) BVerfGE [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/dfr/bv089214.html 89, 214] is a [[German contract law]] case, concerning the interpretation of [[private law]], and particularly the law of [[contract]], in a way that is compatible with basic human rights principles. It was held that the power of [[freedom of contract]] must be interpreted in a way that protects people's genuine (rather than formal) autonomy, in those situations where there is a structural [[inequality of bargaining power]].

==Facts==
The case concerned a series of claimants, including spouses and children, of a party which had mortgaged the family home, in order to secure a loan from a bank. The banks had required that, in return for the loans, the family would guarantee the debts. The validity of these contracts were challenged.

==Judgment==

{{Cquote|56. In contract law, a just balance of interests results from a concurrence of wills among the contracting parties. Both bind themselves and in doing so protect their own individual freedom of action. If one contracting party has such a strong presence that he can factually determine the contract’s content unilaterally, this means that the other party loses autonomy (cf. BVerfGE 81, 242 [255]). Admittedly, the legal order cannot envisage all situations where negotiating parity is more or less compromised. For reasons of legal certainty a contract cannot be brought into question or be corrected with every disruption of negotiating parity. However, in cases of typical types, where one party to a contract may be recognised as being structurally weaker, and if the consequences for the weaker contracting party are significantly imbalanced, the civil law order must react and make correction possible. This follows from the fundamental guarantee of private autonomy (Article 2(1) GG) and the principle of the social state (Article 20(1), Article 28(1) GG).

[...]

59. [...] If the content of a contract is significantly onerous and obviously unreasonable as a balance of interests, a court may not content itself with the conclusion that: “contract is contract”. On the contrary, it must clarify whether the provision is the consequence of structurally unequal bargaining strength, and where appropriate make correction within the framework of the general principles of the civil law.}}

The '''Bus Services Act 2017''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It provides for local transport authorities to create partnership schemes to improve bus services in their areas, and to introduce advanced ticketing schemes.
The Act also provides for [[Combined Authority|mayoral combined authorities]] to partially re-regulate bus services by creating franchise schemes similar to the one operated by [[Transport for London]]. It, however, prohibits local authorities from reversing complete [[Bus deregulation in Great Britain|bus deregulation]] by forming a [[Municipal bus company|company for the purpose of providing local services]].

A '''business prohibition''' is a prohibition issued by a court that prohibits an individual from holding a position of responsibility in a [[corporation]].&lt;ref name="Define"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/prohibition.html|title=Definition from BusinessDictionary|accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business prohibitions are given as punishments and as preemptive measures following aggravated offences while in office, such as [[false accounting]], or gross neglect of duties. The objective is to ascertain public trust in corporations: if the offender's actions are liable to damage the trust of debtors, partners or other parties of contracts, a business prohibition is issued.

An individual with a business prohibition may not found or run any sort of a corporation, be in a corporate executive board, be employed as a [[CEO]] or even use one's powers as a [[Shareholder|stock owner]], even by proxy. If a proxy agrees to circumvent the prohibition, he may be convicted as an accessory to a crime.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9788">A '''central securities depository''' ('''CSD''') is a specialist financial organization holding [[securities]] such as [[Share (finance)|shares]] either in certificated or uncertificated ([[Dematerialization (securities)|dematerialized]]) form so that ownership can be easily transferred through a [[book entry]] rather than the transfer of physical certificates.  This allows [[brokerage firm|brokers]] and financial companies to hold their securities at one location where they can be available for [[clearing (finance)|clearing]] and [[Settlement (finance)|settlement]].  This is usually done electronically, making it much faster and easier than was traditionally the case where physical certificates had to be exchanged after a trade had been completed.

In some cases these organizations also carry out centralized comparison, and transaction processing such as clearing and settlement of securities.

== Scope ==
A CSD can be national or international in nature, and may be for a specific type of security, such as [[government bond]]s.

===Domestic central securities depository===
Many countries have one domestic CSD that was traditionally associated with the national stock exchange.  These organizations are typically heavily regulated by the government and may or may not be separate from the exchanges where trading in securities occurs.

===International central securities depository (ICSD)===
An international CSD is a central securities depository that settles trades in international securities such as [[eurobond]]s although many also settle trades in various domestic securities, usually through direct or indirect (through local agents) links to local CSDs.  Examples of international CSDs include [[Clearstream]] (previously [[Cedel]]), [[Euroclear]] and SIX SIS.  While viewed as a national CSD rather than an ICSD, the US [[Depository Trust Company|Depository Trust Company (DTC)]] does hold over $2 trillion in non-US securities and in [[American depositary receipt]]s from over 100 nations.

==Functions==
* '''Safekeeping''' Securities may be in dematerialized form, book-entry only form (with one or more "global" certificates), or in physical form immobilized within the CSD.  
* '''Deposit and withdrawal''' Supporting deposits and withdrawals involves the relationship between the transfer agent and/or issuers and the CSD.  It also covers the CSD's role within the [[underwriting]] process or listing of new issues in a market.
* '''Dividend, interest, and principal processing, as well as corporate actions including proxy voting''' Paying and transfer agents, as well as issuers are involved in these processes, depending on the level of services provided by the CSD and its relationship with these entities. 
* '''Other services''' CSDs offer additional services aside from those considered core services.  These services include  securities [[lending]] and borrowing, matching, and [[repurchase agreement|repo]] settlement, or ISIN assistance.
* '''Pledge''' - Central depositories provide pledging of share and securities.  Every country is required to provide legal framework to protect the interest of the pledger and pledgee.

However, there are risks and responsibilities regarding these services that must be taken into consideration in analyzing and evaluating each market on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exchange-handbook.co.uk/articles_story.cfm?id=38756&amp;search=1  exchange-handbook.co uk article] on the risks associated with Depositories, at the ''Handbook of world stock, derivative and commodity exchanges'' website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chartered Institute of Loss Adjusters (CILA) is a Chartered Professional Body that sets the professional and ethical standards for Claims handling.  The aims of the Institute's Charter are to promote the education of its members and it therefore provides its members with a range of qualifications from a Level 3 Certificate recognised on the [http://ofqual.gov.uk/qualifications-and-assessments/qualification-frameworks/# Qualification Credit Framework] in the UK to a Masters level 7 qualification.  Accreditation for the highest level qualification which is required to become a Chartered Loss Adjuster is provided by Bournemouth University.  [http://courses.bournemouth.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate-degree/professional-development-loss-adjusting/none/3741/]{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}

The Institute has a Guide to Professional Conduct, a Royal Charter and Bye-Laws.  All of these can be found via their web site [http://www.cila.co.uk www.cila.co.uk]

Loss Adjusting can to an extent be traced back to the Great Fire of London in 1666 following which Judges decided on compensation payments to the victims.  When the Association of Fire Loss Adjusters was formed in 1941, the founding President, J McMullen-Brooks had the outstanding idea for the coat of arms of the Association. It was the scale of justice upon the sword of truth, elaborated with bundles of rods bound around an axe to symbolise the strength of members uniting together and surmounted by a crest of a lamp to indicate learning.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The Chartered Institute of Loss Adjusters obtained its Royal Charter in December 1961 and is governed by its Council.  Amendments to Charters can be made only with the agreement of The Queen in Council, and amendments to the body’s by-laws require the approval of the Council (though not normally of Her Majesty). This effectively means a significant degree of Government regulation of the affairs of the body, and the Privy Council will therefore wish to be satisfied that such regulation accords with public policy .  There are strict rules concerning Royal Charters and the CILA can be found listed as a body holding a Royal Charter via http://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/royal-charters/chartered-bodies/

Being an Institute of individual members a President and Officers are elected each year at the Annual General Meeting.  In 2013 the Institute elected its first lady President [https://web.archive.org/web/20140913144832/http://www.echelonccl.com/our-people/the-claims-team/candy-holland/ Candy Holland] who took over from [https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=42891081&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=P2gw&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah2&amp;trkInfo=tarId%3A1410605292640%2Ctas%3Akevin%20wood%2Cidx%3A1-1-1 Kevin Wood] in September 2013.

Loss Adjusters help to resolve claims mainly but not always insurance claims.  The Association of British Insurers makes reference to Loss Adjuster in the handling of claims in such areas as  the 2011 Riots and their website includes guidance to those affected by the riots https://www.abi.org.uk/~/media/Files/Documents/Publications/Public/Migrated/Riots/Recovering%20after%20riots%20ABI%20guidance%20for%20property%20owners%20and%20businesses.pdf

The Institute has a small Secretariat with an Executive Director [https://www.linkedin.com/in/malcolmjhyde Malcolm Hyde], appointed in 2009 who authored a key Loss Adjusting text book [https://web.archive.org/web/20140913131237/http://www.cila.co.uk/node/1660 Property Insurance Law and Claims]

The Institute holds a number of events to supports its members' learning and has a number of Special Interest Groups to aid members in specific areas of interest.  These can be found via [https://web.archive.org/web/20140913145659/http://www.cila.co.uk/about-us/special-interest-groups special-interest-groups]

At the very heart of the Institute is the requirement to act in an ethical and fair way.  This is exampled in the Guide to Professional Conduct which states, amongst other things,

 2. ETHICS &amp; CORE PRINCIPLES

2.1 A member shall act fairly and justly when acting on instructions from an insurer in relation to a policyholders claim under a policy issued by that insurer. Members should understand that they are trusted by Insurers to ensure that their Insurance promise is fairly and speedily delivered. Members should be objective in considering the facts in an impartial way to establish whether the Policy operates and to what extent.

The Institute carries out  work to support its members in key issues and further details can be found via https://web.archive.org/web/20140913150854/http://www.cila.co.uk/node/2013

The CILA is recognised worldwide and has members throughout the globe.  Examinations for the prestigious qualifications are sat by members in many areas including [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Kenya, Nigeria, Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Members achieving the highest level are entitled to use the designation Associate or Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Loss Adjusters.  The designations used are ACILA or FCILA.  The Institute seeks to promote professional standards and therefore has steps toward the highest level and therefore the public may see designations such as Cert CILA and Dip CILA.

The Institute can be contacted via [http://www.cila.co.uk/contact Contact] and a list of events the Institute is holding can be found via http://www.cila.co.uk/news-events

The Institute is considered to be thought leaders in many areas of Insurance Claims settlements.  This is exampled by a book authored by Harry Roberts and Damien Glynn [https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215750/http://www.cila.co.uk/files/265BIsinglePdf.pdf Business Interruption Policy Wordings]

The Chartered Institute of Loss Adjusters
It is an established practice of insurers to instruct independent firms of loss adjusters to deal with serious material and consequential loss claims. They investigate the circumstance in which the fire or other insured peril occurred, establish that a valid claim within the terms of the policy  has arisen, and by negotiation reach agreement with the Insured on the measure of the loss and of Insurers' liability (if any), when they report to the Insurers giving their recommendation as to payment. The adjusters' duties extend to the apportionment of advantage, the collection of evidence to support repudiation of a claim, if this is necessary, or for the prosecution or rebuttal of third party claims, and generally to dealing with all matters that arise when claims are made.
It became clear that it would be to advantage of all concerned if there could be friendly co-operation among the individual firms of adjusters, and in 1941 the Association of Fire Loss Adjusters was formed. The widening scope of the duties of its members led to a realization that the world 'Fire' was too limiting, and on the granting of a royal charter (in 1961) the Association was renamed The Chartered Institute of Loss Adjusters. (Many theft claims are dealt with by adjusters.)
The object of the Institute, as laid down in its charter, include the securing of the observance of strict professional conduct, the co-ordination of the activities of its members for the better execution of their work, and by providing the necessary facilities, the establishing of high standards of education and knowledge.

'''Coca-Cola''', or '''Coke''' is a [[Carbonation|carbonated]] [[soft drink]]&lt;ref&gt;In June 2012, Coca-Cola announced its intentions to begin distributing in [[Myanmar]]. {{cite news|title=Coca-Cola to spend $30 billion to grow globally|first=Leon|last=Stafford|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/business/coca-cola-to-spend-30-billion-to-grow-globally/nR6YS/|newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=September 9, 2012|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; manufactured by [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. Originally intended as a [[patent medicine]], it was invented in the late 19th century by [[John Pemberton]] and was bought out by businessman [[Asa Griggs Candler]], whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century. The drink's name refers to two of its original ingredients: [[coca]] leaves, and [[kola nut]]s (a source of [[caffeine]]). The current [[Coca-Cola formula|formula of Coca-Cola]] remains a [[trade secret]], although a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published.

The Coca-Cola Company produces [[concentrate]], which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola bottlers throughout the world. The bottlers, who hold exclusive territory contracts with the company, produce the finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate, in combination with filtered water and sweeteners. A typical {{convert|12|USfloz|adj=on}} can contains {{convert|38|g}} of sugar (usually in the form of [[high fructose corn syrup]]). The bottlers then sell, distribute, and merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores, restaurants, and [[vending machine]]s throughout the world. The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for [[soda fountain]]s of major restaurants and [[foodservice]] distributors.

The Coca-Cola Company has on occasion introduced other cola drinks under the Coke name. The most common of these is [[Diet Coke]], along with others including [[Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola]], [[Diet Coke Caffeine-Free]], [[Coca-Cola Zero Sugar]], [[Coca-Cola Cherry]], [[Coca-Cola Vanilla]], and special versions with [[Coca-Cola with Lemon|lemon]], [[Coca-Cola with Lime|lime]], and coffee. Based on [[Interbrand]]'s "best global brand" study of 2015, Coca-Cola was the world's third most valuable brand, after Apple and Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2015 Ranking  |url=http://interbrand.com/best-brands/best-global-brands/2015/ranking/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Coke products were sold in over 200 countries worldwide, with consumers drinking more than 1.8 billion company beverage servings each day.&lt;ref&gt;Elmore, 2013, p 717&lt;/ref&gt; Coca-Cola ranked No. 87 in the 2018 [[Fortune 500]] list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/fortune500/list/|title=Fortune 500 Companies 2018: Who Made the List|website=Fortune|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confederate Colonel [[John Pemberton]], who was wounded in the [[American Civil War]] and became addicted to [[morphine]], began a quest to find a substitute for the problematic drug.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gardiner, "The Civil War Origin of Coca-Cola in Columbus, Georgia," ''Muscogiana: Journal of the Muscogee Genealogical Society'' (Spring 2012), Vol. 23: 21–24.&lt;/ref&gt; The prototype [[Coca-Cola formula|Coca-Cola recipe]] was formulated at Pemberton's Eagle Drug and Chemical House,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://facstaff.columbusstate.edu/gardiner_Richard/columbus/John_Pemberton_files/pemberton_1.jpg|accessdate=April 26, 2014|archive-date=September 8, 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130908005438/http://facstaff.columbusstate.edu/gardiner_Richard/columbus/John_Pemberton_files/pemberton_1.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; a drugstore in [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], originally as a [[coca wine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/ga/muscogee/photos/pemberto13411gph.txt |title=Coca-Cola Inventor was Local Pharmacist |work=Columbus Ledger |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/2011/03/27/1514591/columbus-helped-make-cokes-success.html |title=Columbus helped make Coke's success|work=Columbus Ledger-Enquirer|date=March 27, 2011|accessdate=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may have been inspired by the formidable success of [[Vin Mariani]], a French-[[Corsica]]n coca wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast|authorlink=Mark Pendergrast|title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = 25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also worth noting that a Spanish drink called "Kola Coca" was presented at a contest in Philadelphia in 1885, a year before the official birth of Coca-Cola. The rights for this Spanish drink were bought by Coca-Cola in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/08/10/newser-spanish-town-coca-cola/2638515/|title=Spanish town claims origins of Coca-Cola|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885, Pemberton registered his [[Pemberton's French Wine Coca|French Wine Coca]] nerve tonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W4JGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA423&amp;dq=%22pemberton,+john+s.+atlanta%22+nerve#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pemberton%2C%20john%20s.%20atlanta%22%20nerve |title=Annual Report of the Patent Office, 1885 |publisher= |accessdate=April 26, 2014|last1=Patent Office |first1=United States |year=1886 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, when Atlanta and [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]] passed [[prohibition]] legislation, Pemberton responded by developing Coca-Cola, a nonalcoholic version of [[Pemberton's French Wine Coca|French Wine Coca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jack |last=Hayes |title=Coca-Cola Television Advertisements: Dr. John S.

The first sales were at Jacob's Pharmacy in Atlanta, Georgia, on May 8, 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cocacolaweb.online.fr/chronicle/01.php |author=The Coca-Cola Company |title=The Chronicle Of Coca-Cola |accessdate=January 7, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5msXBI0mb?url=http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/heritage/chronicle_birth_refreshing_idea.html |archivedate=January 18, 2010 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially sold as a [[patent medicine]] for five [[Cent (currency)|cents]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2165787/ |title=The Mystery of the 5-Cent Coca-Cola: Why it's so hard for companies to raise prices |first=Tim |last=Harford |work=Slate |date=May 11, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QDrW0o9d?url=http://www.slate.com/id/2165787/ |archivedate=July 10, 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; a glass at [[soda fountain]]s, which were popular in the United States at the time due to the belief that [[carbonated water]] was good for the health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/ccmphtml/colatime1.html |title=Themes for Coca-Cola Advertising (1886–1999) |accessdate=February 11, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5msXBPJgs?url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/ccmphtml/colatime1.html |archivedate=January 18, 2010 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pemberton claimed Coca-Cola cured many diseases, including morphine addiction, indigestion, nerve disorders, headaches, and [[impotence]]. Pemberton ran the first advertisement for the beverage on May 29 of the same year in the ''[[Atlanta Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = 32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1888, three versions of Coca-Cola – sold by three separate businesses – were on the market. A co-partnership had been formed on January 14, 1888 between Pemberton and four Atlanta businessmen: J.C. Mayfield, A.O. Murphey, C.O. Mullahy, and E.H. Bloodworth. Not codified by any signed document, a verbal statement given by Asa Candler years later asserted under testimony that he had acquired a stake in Pemberton's company as early as 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = 42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Pemberton declared that the ''name'' "Coca-Cola" belonged to his son, Charley, but the other two manufacturers could continue to use the ''formula''.&lt;ref name="Pendergrast1"&gt;{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| pages = 45&amp;nbsp;–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charley Pemberton's record of control over the "Coca-Cola" name was the underlying factor that allowed for him to participate as a major shareholder in the March 1888 Coca-Cola Company incorporation filing made in his father's place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = 45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Charley's exclusive control over the "Coca-Cola" name became a continual thorn in Asa Candler's side.
Candler's oldest son, Charles Howard Candler, authored a book in 1950 published by [[Emory University]]. In this definitive biography about his father, Candler specifically states: "..., on April 14, 1888, the young druggist Asa Griggs Candler purchased a one-third interest in the formula of an almost completely unknown proprietary elixir known as Coca-Cola."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Candler, Charles Howard | title = Asa Griggs Candler | year = 1950 | publisher = Emory University | page = 81 | location = Georgia }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:- Coca-Cola - Old bottle opener -.jpg|right|thumb|Old German Coca-Cola [[bottle opener]].]]
The deal was actually between John Pemberton's son Charley and Walker, Candler &amp; Co. – with John Pemberton acting as cosigner for his son. For $50 down and $500 in 30 days, Walker, Candler &amp; Co. obtained all of the one-third interest in the Coca-Cola Company that Charley held, all while Charley still held on to the name. After the April 14 deal, on April 17, 1888, one-half of the Walker/Dozier interest shares were acquired by Candler for an additional $750.&lt;ref name=ForGodCountryandCocaColapg44-45&gt;{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| pages = 44&amp;nbsp;–45  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Coca-Cola Company===
In 1892, Candler set out to incorporate a second company; "The Coca-Cola Company" (the current corporation). When Candler had the earliest records of the "Coca-Cola Company" burned in 1910, the action was claimed to have been made during a move to new corporation offices around this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = 49  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Candler had gained a better foothold on Coca-Cola in April 1888, he nevertheless was forced to sell the beverage he produced with the recipe he had under the names "Yum Yum" and "Koke". This was while Charley Pemberton was selling the elixir, although a cruder mixture, under the name "Coca-Cola", all with his father's blessing. After both names failed to catch on for Candler, by the middle of 1888, the Atlanta pharmacist was quite anxious to establish a firmer legal claim to Coca-Cola, and hoped he could force his two competitors, Walker and Dozier, completely out of the business, as well.&lt;ref name="ForGodCountryandCocaColapg44-45" /&gt;

On August 16, 1888, Dr. John Stith Pemberton suddenly died; Asa G. Candler then sought to move swiftly forward to attain his vision of taking full control of the whole Coca-Cola operation.

Charley Pemberton, an alcoholic, was the one obstacle who unnerved Asa Candler more than anyone else. Candler is said to have quickly maneuvered to purchase the exclusive rights to the name "Coca-Cola" from Pemberton's son Charley right after Dr. Pemberton's death. One of several stories was that Candler bought the title to the name from Charley's mother for $300; approaching her at Dr. Pemberton's funeral. Eventually, Charley Pemberton was found on June 23, 1894, unconscious, with a stick of opium by his side. Ten days later, Charley died at Atlanta's Grady Hospital at the age of 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| pages = 48&amp;nbsp;–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Charles Howard Candler's 1950 book about his father, he stated: "On August 30th [1888], he [Asa Candler] became sole proprietor of Coca-Cola, a fact which was stated on letterheads, invoice blanks and advertising copy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Candler, Charles Howard | title = Asa Griggs Candler | year = 1950 | publisher = Emory University | page = 81 | location = Georgia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this action on August 30, 1888, Candler's sole control became technically all true. Candler had negotiated with Margaret Dozier and her brother Woolfolk Walker a full payment amounting to $1,000, which all agreed Candler could pay off with a series of notes over a specified time span. By May 1, 1889, Candler was now claiming full ownership of the Coca-Cola beverage, with a total investment outlay by Candler for the drink enterprise over the years amounting to $2,300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = 46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, Margaret Dozier, as co-owner of the original Coca-Cola Company in 1888, came forward to claim that her signature on the 1888 Coca-Cola Company bill of sale had been forged. Subsequent analysis of certain similar transfer documents had also indicated John Pemberton's signature was most likely a forgery, as well, which some accounts claim was precipitated by his son Charley.&lt;ref name="Pendergrast1" /&gt;

On September 12, 1919, Coca-Cola Co. was purchased by a group of investors for $25 million and reincorporated. The company publicly offered 500,000 shares of the company for $40 a share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/thisday/gahistory/09/12/coca-cola-sale-completed|title=This Day in Georgia History – Coca-Cola Sale Completed – GeorgiaInfo|work=usg.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/business-economy/robert-w-woodruff-1889-1985|title=Robert W.

In 1986, The Coca-Cola Company merged with two of their bottling operators (owned by JTL Corporation and BCI Holding Corporation) to form Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE).&lt;ref name="cokecce.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cokecce.com/about-cce/our-story|title=Coca-Cola Enterprises : Our Story|publisher=Coca-Cola Enterprises|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150417095329/http://www.cokecce.com/about-cce/our-story|archivedate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1991, Coca-Cola Enterprises merged with the Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group, Inc.&lt;ref name="cokecce.com" /&gt;

===Origins of bottling===
[[File:Commercial. At the Coca Cola Plant BAnQ P48S1P06539.jpg|thumb|Bottling plant of Coca-Cola Canada Ltd. January 8, 1941. [[Montreal]], Canada.]]
The first bottling of Coca-Cola occurred in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], Mississippi, at the Biedenharn Candy Company in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/our-company/history-of-bottling|title=History of Bottling|author=The Coca-Cola Company|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proprietor of the bottling works was [[Joseph A. Biedenharn]]. The original bottles were [[Hutchinson Patent Stopper|Hutchinson]] bottles, very different from the much later hobble-skirt design of 1915 now so familiar.

It was then a few years later that two entrepreneurs from [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], namely [[Benjamin Thomas (Coca-Cola bottler)|Benjamin F. Thomas]] and [[Joseph B. Whitehead]], proposed the idea of bottling and were so persuasive that Candler signed a contract giving them control of the procedure for only one dollar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coca-Cola History|website=worldofcoca-cola.com|url=https://www.worldofcoca-cola.com/about-us/coca-cola-history}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candler never collected his dollar, but in 1899, Chattanooga became the site of the first Coca-Cola bottling company. Candler remained very content just selling his company's syrup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cocacolaunited.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/HISTORY-OF-CHATTANOOGA-COCA-COLA-WORLDS-FIRST-BOTTLING-COMPANY.pdf |title= Chattanooga Coca-Cola History |accessdate=August 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The loosely termed contract proved to be problematic for The Coca-Cola Company for decades to come. Legal matters were not helped by the decision of the bottlers to subcontract to other companies, effectively becoming parent bottlers.&lt;ref name="history-of-bottling"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/our-company/history-of-bottling |title=History Of Bottling |accessdate=January 7, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5msXCIx46?url=http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/ourcompany/historybottling.html |archivedate=January 18, 2010 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This contract specified that bottles would be sold at 5¢ each and had no fixed duration, leading to [[the fixed price of Coca-Cola from 1886 to 1959]].

===20th century===
The first outdoor wall advertisement that promoted the Coca-Cola drink was painted in 1894 in [[Cartersville, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM2DK6 First painted wall sign to advertise Coca-Cola : Cartersville, GA] – Waymarking&lt;/ref&gt;  Cola syrup was sold as an over-the-counter [[dietary supplement]] for upset stomach.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, The Doctors Book of Home Remedies.

This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease."&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time of its 50th anniversary, the soft drink had reached the status of a national icon in the USA. In 1935, it was certified [[kosher]] by Atlanta Rabbi [[Tobias Geffen]], after the company made minor changes in the sourcing of some ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ajhs.org/scholarship/chapters/chapter.cfm?documentID=270 | title=Beyond Seltzer Water: The Kashering of Coca-Cola | publisher = American Jewish Historical Society |accessdate=February 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Coke===

[[File:World-of-coca-cola.jpg|thumb|The [[Las Vegas Strip]] ''[[World of Coca-Cola]]'' museum in 2003]]
On April 23, 1985, Coca-Cola, amid much publicity, attempted to change the [[Coca-Cola formula|formula]] of the drink with "New Coke". Follow-up taste tests revealed most consumers preferred the taste of New Coke to both Coke and [[Pepsi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1913612_1913610_1913608,00.html|title=New Coke – Top 10 Bad Beverage Ideas|date=April 23, 2010|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Coca-Cola management was unprepared for the public's [[nostalgia]] for the old drink, leading to a [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]]. The company gave in to protests and returned to a variation of the old formula using high fructose corn syrup instead of cane sugar as the main sweetener, under the name Coca-Cola Classic, on July 10, 1985.

===21st century===
On July 5, 2005, it was revealed that Coca-Cola would resume operations in Iraq for the first time since the [[Arab League]] boycotted the company in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rory Carroll in Baghdad |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jul/05/iraq.rorycarroll |title=Cola wars as Coke moves on Baghdad |work=The Guardian   |date= July 5, 2005|accessdate=March 13, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, in Canada, the name "Coca-Cola Classic" was changed back to "Coca-Cola". The word "Classic" was removed because "New Coke" was no longer in production, eliminating the need to differentiate between the two.&lt;ref&gt;According to a Coca-Cola customer-service representative.&lt;/ref&gt; The formula remained unchanged. In January 2009, Coca-Cola stopped printing the word "Classic" on the labels of {{convert|16|USfloz|ml|adj=on}} bottles sold in parts of the southeastern United States.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news |title=Coke to Omit 'Classic' |first=Betsy |last=McKay |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=January 30, 2009 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123332768434033495 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The change is part of a larger strategy to rejuvenate the product's image.&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt; The word "Classic" was removed from all Coca-Cola products by 2011.

In November 2009, due to a dispute over wholesale prices of Coca-Cola products, [[Costco]] stopped restocking its shelves with Coke and Diet Coke for two months; a separate pouring rights deal in 2013 saw Coke products removed from Costco food courts in favor of Pepsi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bevnet.com/news/2013/pepsicos-in-the-club-store-that-is-capturing-costco-food-service-account|title=PepsiCo's In The Club… Store, that is, Capturing Costco Food Service Account|last=Klinemann|first=Jeffrey|date=January 31, 2013|publisher=[[BevNET]]|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Costco locations (such as the ones in [[Tucson, Arizona]]) additionally sell [[Mexican Coke|imported Coca-Cola from Mexico]] with cane sugar instead of corn syrup from separate distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Fredrix, Emily and Sarah Skidmore |title=Costco nixes Coke products over pricing dispute |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hC_n50ZLyl8FLDBIkGfCn7-110BwD9C1F1C80 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=November 17, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.li/20091120184311/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hC_n50ZLyl8FLDBIkGfCn7-110BwD9C1F1C80 |archivedate=November 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coca-Cola introduced the 7.5-ounce mini-can in 2009, and on September 22, 2011, the company announced price reductions, asking retailers to sell eight-packs for $2.99. That same day, Coca-Cola announced the 12.5-ounce bottle, to sell for 89 cents. A 16-ounce bottle has sold well at 99 cents since being re-introduced, but the price was going up to $1.19.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Formula of natural flavorings===
{{Main|Coca-Cola formula}}

The exact formula of Coca-Cola's natural flavorings (but not its other ingredients, which are listed on the side of the bottle or can) is a [[trade secret]]. The original copy of the formula was held in [[SunTrust Bank]]'s main vault in Atlanta for 86 years. Its predecessor, the Trust Company, was the [[underwriter]] for the Coca-Cola Company's [[initial public offering]] in 1919. On December 8, 2011, the original secret formula was moved from the vault at SunTrust Banks to a new vault containing the formula which will be on display for visitors to its [[World of Coca-Cola]] museum in downtown Atlanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Latest-News-Wires/2011/1208/Coca-Cola-formula-after-86-years-in-vault-gets-new-home | title=Coca-Cola formula, after 86 years in vault, gets new home | journal=Christian Science Monitor | date=December 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Snopes, a popular myth states that only two executives have access to the formula, with each executive having only half the formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/ |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Cokelore |accessdate=February 10, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QDrZGjcI?url=http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/ |archivedate=July 10, 2007 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several sources state that while Coca-Cola does have a rule restricting access to only two executives, each knows the entire formula and others, in addition to the prescribed duo, have known the formulation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/formula.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Cokelore (Have a Cloak and a Smile) |accessdate=February 22, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5msXBxkB7?url=http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/formula.asp |archivedate=January 18, 2010 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 11, 2011, [[Ira Glass]] said on his [[Public Radio International|PRI]] radio show, ''[[This American Life]]'', that ''TAL'' staffers had found a recipe in "Everett Beal's Recipe Book", reproduced in the February 28, 1979, issue of ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', that they believed was either Pemberton's original formula for Coca-Cola, or a version that he made either before or after the product hit the market in 1886. The formula basically matched the one found in Pemberton's diary.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Rogers, [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/blog-post/2011/02/this_american_life_bursts_coca.html "'This American Life' bursts Coca-Cola's bubble: What's in that original recipe, anyway?,"] ''[[Washington Post]]'' BlogPost, February 15, 2011.

===Use of stimulants in formula===
[[File:Pembertoncokeanzeige.jpg|thumb|An early Coca-Cola advertisement.]]

When launched, Coca-Cola's two key ingredients were [[cocaine]] and [[caffeine]]. The cocaine was derived from the [[coca]] leaf and the caffeine from [[kola nut]] (also spelled "cola nut" at the time), leading to the name Coca-Cola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pponline.co.uk/encyc/0204.htm |title=Coca-cola |publisher=Pponline.co.uk |accessdate=March 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115102804/http://www.pponline.co.uk/encyc/0204.htm |archivedate=November 15, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/cstartinventions/a/coca_cola.htm |title=The History of Coca-Cola |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QDrW0eoP?url=http://inventors.about.com/od/cstartinventions/a/coca_cola.htm |archivedate=July 10, 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coca – cocaine====
Although Coca Cola denies usage of cocaine,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.coca-cola.co.uk/faq/does-coca-cola-contain-cocaine|title=Does Coca-Cola contain cocaine? {{!}} FAQ {{!}} Coca-Cola GB|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pemberton called for five [[ounce]]s of coca leaf per gallon of syrup (approximately 37&amp;nbsp;g/L), a significant dose; in 1891, Candler claimed his formula (altered extensively from Pemberton's original) contained only a tenth of this amount. Coca-Cola once contained an estimated nine milligrams of cocaine per glass. (For comparison, a typical dose or "line" of cocaine is 50–75&amp;nbsp;mg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegooddrugsguide.com/cocaine/faq.htm|title=Cocaine Facts - How to Tell Use of Cocaine - Questions, Myths, Truth|website=thegooddrugsguide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) In 1903, it was removed.&lt;ref&gt;Liebowitz, Michael, R. (1983). ''The Chemistry of Love''. Boston: Little, Brown, &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1904, instead of using fresh leaves, Coca-Cola started using "spent" leaves&amp;nbsp;– the leftovers of the cocaine-extraction process with trace levels of cocaine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_033.html |title=Is it true Coca-Cola once contained cocaine? |accessdate=February 27, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5msXBwkls?url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_033.html |archivedate=January 18, 2010 |deadurl=no  |date=1985-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Coca-Cola uses a cocaine-free coca leaf extract prepared at a [[Stepan Company]] plant in [[Maywood, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="mayclifford"&gt;May, Clifford D. [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/01/business/how-coca-cola-obtains-its-coca.html "How Coca-Cola Obtains Its Coca"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 1, 1988. Accessed April 11, 2008. "A Stepan laboratory in Maywood, N.J., is the nation's only legal commercial importer of coca leaves, which it obtains mainly from Peru and, to a lesser extent, Bolivia. Besides producing the coca flavoring agent sold to The Coca-Cola Company, Stepan extracts [[cocaine]] from the coca leaves, which it sells to [[Mallinckrodt]] Inc., a St. Louis pharmaceutical manufacturer that is the only company in the United States licensed to purify the product for medicinal use." See links for more information&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the Stepan Company is the only manufacturing plant authorized by the Federal Government to import and process the coca plant,&lt;ref name="mayclifford" /&gt; which it obtains mainly from Peru and, to a lesser extent, Bolivia. Besides producing the coca flavoring agent for Coca-Cola, the Stepan Company extracts cocaine from the coca leaves, which it sells to [[Mallinckrodt]], a [[St. Louis, Missouri]], [[pharmaceutical]] manufacturer that is the only company in the United States licensed to purify cocaine for medicinal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Drew |last=Benson |title=Coca kick in drinks spurs export fears |url=http://www.mindfully.org/Food/2004/Kdrink-Coca-Drink19apr04.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120530045600/http://www.mindfully.org/Food/2004/Kdrink-Coca-Drink19apr04.htm |archivedate=May 30, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long after the syrup had ceased to contain any significant amount of cocaine, in the southeastern U.S., "dope" remained a common colloquialism for Coca-Cola, and "dope-wagons" were trucks that transported it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncpedia.org/dope-wagons|title=Dope Wagons|work=ncpedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional shape of the bottle is said to resemble the seed-pod of the coca bush, memorializing the cocaine recipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sophie D.

====Kola nuts – caffeine====
Kola nuts act as a flavoring and the source of caffeine in Coca-Cola. In Britain, for example, the ingredient label states "Flavourings (Including Caffeine)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/yourhealth/what_our_labels_tell_you/ |title=Coca-Cola Your Health – You and Your Family's GDA Questions Answered |publisher=Coca-cola.co.uk |date=April 13, 2010 |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kola nuts contain about 2.0 to 3.5% caffeine, are of bitter flavor, and are commonly used in [[cola]] [[soft drinks]]. In 1911, the U.S. government initiated ''[[United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola]]'', hoping to force Coca-Cola to remove caffeine from its formula. The case was decided in favor of Coca-Cola. Subsequently, in 1912, the U.S. Pure Food and Drug Act was amended, adding caffeine to the list of "habit-forming" and "deleterious" substances which must be listed on a product's label.

Coca-Cola contains 34&amp;nbsp;mg of caffeine per 12 fluid ounces (9.8&amp;nbsp;mg per 100&amp;nbsp;ml).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Gene A. Spiller| title = Caffeine Content of Some Cola Beverages| url = https://books.google.com/?id=WxmBmvhsoZ8C&amp;pg=PA363&amp;lpg=PA363&amp;dq=caffeine+coca+cola| year = 1998| publisher = CRC| isbn = 978-0-8493-2647-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Franchised production model===
The actual production and distribution of Coca-Cola follows a franchising model. The Coca-Cola Company only produces a syrup concentrate, which it sells to bottlers throughout the world, who hold Coca-Cola franchises for one or more geographical areas. The bottlers produce the final drink by mixing the syrup with filtered water and sweeteners, and then carbonate it before putting it in cans and bottles, which the bottlers then sell and distribute to retail stores, vending machines, restaurants, and food service distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/ourcompany/aboutbottling.html |title=Offices &amp; Bottling Plants |accessdate=January 7, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216144908/http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/ourcompany/aboutbottling.html |archivedate=February 16, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coca-Cola Company owns minority shares in some of its largest franchises, such as [[Coca-Cola Enterprises]], [[Coca-Cola Amatil]], [[Coca-Cola Hellenic]] Bottling Company, and [[Coca-Cola FEMSA]], but fully independent bottlers produce almost half of the volume sold in the world.

Coca-Cola has been a point of legal discussion in the Middle East. In the early 20th century, a [[fatwa]] was created in Egypt to discuss the question of "whether Muslims were permitted to drink Coca-Cola and Pepsi cola."&lt;ref name="Liebesny 1975 42–43"&gt;{{cite book|last=Liebesny|first=Herbert J.|title=The law of the Near and Middle East readings, cases, and materials|year=1975|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fatwa states: "According to the Muslim Hanefite, Shafi'ite, etc., the rule in Islamic law of forbidding or allowing foods and beverages is based on the presumption that such things are permitted unless it can be shown that they are forbidden on the basis of the Qur'an."&lt;ref name="Liebesny 1975 42–43" /&gt; The Muslim jurists stated that, unless the Qu'ran specifically prohibits the consumption of a particular product, it is permissible to consume. Another clause was discussed, whereby the same rules apply if a person is unaware of the condition or ingredients of the item in question.

==={{anchor|Logo}} Logo design===
The Coca-Cola logo was created by John Pemberton's bookkeeper, [[Frank Mason Robinson]], in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/advertisingmedia/ss/Coca_Cola_Comp_2.htm |title=Coca-Cola Company&amp;nbsp;— Red Spencerian Script |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5msXCGA2o?url=http://inventors.about.com/od/advertisingmedia/ss/Coca_Cola_Comp_2.htm |archivedate=January 18, 2010 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson came up with the name and chose the logo's distinctive cursive script. The writing style used, known as [[Spencerian Script|Spencerian script]], was developed in the mid-19th century and was the dominant form of formal handwriting in the United States during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.coca-colajourney.com.au/stories/trace-the-130-year-evolution-of-the-coca-cola-logo |title=The 130-year Evolution of the Coca-Cola logo |website=The Coca-Cola Company |language=en-AU |access-date=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson also played a significant role in early Coca-Cola advertising. His promotional suggestions to Pemberton included giving away thousands of free drink coupons and plastering the city of [[Atlanta]] with publicity banners and [[streetcar]] signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Frank Robinson, creator of the Coca-Cola logo| url=http://coca-cola-art.com/2008/06/05/frank-robinson/| accessdate = December 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contour bottle design===
{{redirect|Coke bottle|the song|Coke Bottle (song)}}
The  Coca-Cola bottle, called the "contour bottle" within the company, was created by bottle designer [[Earl R. Dean]] and Coca-Cola's [[general counsel]], [[Harold Hirsch]]. In 1915, The Coca-Cola Company was represented by their general counsel to launch a competition among its bottle suppliers as well as any competition entrants to create a new bottle for their beverage that would distinguish it from other beverage bottles, "a bottle which a person could recognize even if they felt it in the dark, and so shaped that, even if broken, a person could tell at a glance what it was."&lt;ref name="vigo.lib.in.us"&gt;{{cite web |title=Inventory: Earl R. Dean Collection |url=http://www.vigo.lib.in.us/archives/inventories/business/dean.php|publisher=[[Vigo County Public Library]]|accessdate=December 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/the-story-of-the-coca-cola-bottle | title=The Story of the Coca-Cola Bottle | work=[[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]] | date=February 26, 2015 | accessdate=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ccbanet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TBL_Spring-Summer_324.pdf | title=The Contour Bottle Celebrates Its 100th Birthday! | work= Coca Cola Bottlers Association | date=2015 | accessdate=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="His Life and Madness"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bSAChoqpnHUC&amp;q=harold+hirsch#v=snippet&amp;q=harold%20hirsch |author=Mark Pendergrast |title= For God, Country, and Coca-Cola |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |year=2004 |pages=104 |isbn= 9780684826790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman J. Root, president of [[the Root Glass Company]] of [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], turned the project over to members of his supervisory staff, including company auditor T. Clyde Edwards, plant superintendent Alexander Samuelsson, and [[Earl R. Dean]], bottle designer and supervisor of the bottle molding room. Root and his subordinates decided to base the bottle's design on one of the soda's two ingredients, the [[coca leaf]] or the [[kola nut]], but were unaware of what either ingredient looked like. Dean and Edwards went to the [[Emeline Fairbanks Memorial Library]] and were unable to find any information about coca or kola. Instead, Dean was inspired by a picture of the gourd-shaped [[cocoa pod]] in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. Dean made a rough sketch of the pod and returned to the plant to show Root. He explained to Root how he could transform the shape of the pod into a bottle. Root gave Dean his approval.&lt;ref name="vigo.lib.in.us" /&gt;

Faced with the upcoming scheduled maintenance of the mold-making machinery, over the next 24 hours Dean sketched out a concept drawing which was approved by Root the next morning. Dean then proceeded to create a bottle mold and produced a small number of bottles before the glass-molding machinery was turned off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Bottle |last=Lundy |first=Betty |year=1986 |publisher=American Heritage Inc. |issn=0002-8738 |pages=98–101 |url=http://contourbottle.angelfire.com/The_Bottle.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman Root approved the prototype bottle and a [[design patent]] was issued on the bottle in November 1915. The prototype never made it to production since its middle diameter was larger than its base, making it unstable on [[conveyor belt]]s. Dean resolved this issue by decreasing the bottle's middle diameter. During the 1916 bottler's convention, Dean's contour bottle was chosen over other entries and was on the market the same year. By 1920, the contour bottle became the standard for The Coca-Cola Company. A revised version was also patented in 1923. Because the Patent Office releases the ''Patent Gazette'' on Tuesday, the bottle was patented on December 25, 1923, and was nicknamed the "Christmas bottle." Today, the contour Coca-Cola bottle is one of the most recognized packages on the planet..."even in the dark!".&lt;ref name="history-of-bottling" /&gt;

As a reward for his efforts, Dean was offered a choice between a $500 bonus or a lifetime job at [[the Root Glass Company]]. He chose the lifetime job and kept it until the [[Owens-Illinois Glass Company]] bought out [[the Root Glass Company]] in the mid-1930s. Dean went on to work in other Midwestern glass factories.{{citation needed|date = May 2014}}

One alternative depiction has [[Raymond Loewy]] as the inventor of the unique design, but, while Loewy did serve as a designer of Coke cans and bottles in later years, he was in the [[French Army]] the year the bottle was invented and did not emigrate to the United States until 1919. Others have attributed inspiration for the design not to the cocoa pod, but to a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] [[Hoop skirt|hooped dress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/bottle.asp |title=Snopes urban legend of the Coca-Cola bottle shape |publisher=Snopes.com |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, Associate Justice [[Roger J. Traynor]] of the [[Supreme Court of California]] took advantage of a case involving a waitress injured by an exploding Coca-Cola bottle to articulate the doctrine of [[strict liability]] for [[product liability|defective products]]. Traynor's [[concurring opinion]] in ''[[Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co.]]'' is widely recognized as a landmark case in U.S. law today.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Lawrence M. Friedman, ''American Law in the 20th century'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004), 356–357, and Jay M. Feinman, ''Law 101: Everything You Need to Know About the American Legal System'', rev. ed. (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), 165–168.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Lagerfeld]] is the latest designer to have created a collection of aluminum bottles for Coca-Cola. Lagerfeld is not the first fashion designer to create a special version of the famous Coca-Cola Contour bottle. A number of other limited edition bottles by fashion designers for Coca-Cola Light soda have been created in the last few years.

In 2009, in Italy, Coca-Cola Light had a Tribute to Fashion to celebrate 100 years of the recognizable contour bottle. Well known Italian designers Alberta Ferretti, Blumarine, Etro, Fendi, Marni, Missoni, Moschino, and Versace each designed limited edition bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifitshipitshere.blogspot.com/2010/04/coca-cola-light-get-dressed-by-another.html|title=Coca-Cola Light Gets Dressed By Another Designer, Karl Lagerfeld|accessdate=May 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coca-Cola's advertising has significantly affected [[Culture of the United States|American culture]], and it is frequently credited with inventing the modern image of [[Santa Claus]] as an old man in a red-and-white suit. Although the company did start using the red-and-white Santa image in the 1930s, with its winter advertising campaigns illustrated by [[Haddon Sundblom]], the motif was already common.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Mikkelson and David P.

Coca-Cola's first such advertisement appeared in 1895, featuring the young Bostonian actress [[Hilda Clark (model)|Hilda Clark]] as its spokeswoman.

1941 saw the first use of the nickname "Coke" as an official trademark for the product, with a series of advertisements informing consumers that "Coke means Coca-Cola".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coca-colaconversations.com/my_weblog/2008/06/coke-means-coca.html |title=Coke means Coca-Cola |publisher=Coca-Cola Conversations |date=June 16, 2008 |accessdate=March 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226184252/http://www.coca-colaconversations.com/my_weblog/2008/06/coke-means-coca.html |archivedate=February 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, a song from a Coca-Cola commercial called "[[I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing]]", produced by [[Roquel Billy Davis|Billy Davis]], became a [[hit single]].

Coke's advertising is pervasive, as one of [[Ernest Woodruff|Woodruff]]'s stated goals was to ensure that everyone on Earth drank Coca-Cola as their preferred beverage. This is especially true in southern areas of the United States, such as [[Atlanta]], where Coke was born.

Some Coca-Cola [[Television advertisement|television commercials]] between 1960 through 1986 were written and produced by former Atlanta radio veteran [[Don Naylor]] ([[WGST]] 1936–1950, [[WAGA (TV)|WAGA]] 1951–1959) during his career as a producer for the [[McCann Erickson]] [[advertising agency]]. Many of these early television commercials for Coca-Cola featured movie stars, sports heroes, and popular singers.

During the 1980s, [[Pepsi-Cola]] ran a series of television advertisements showing people participating in taste tests demonstrating that, according to the commercials, "fifty percent of the participants who said they preferred Coke ''actually'' chose the Pepsi." Statisticians pointed out the problematic nature of a 50/50 result: most likely, the taste tests showed that in blind tests, most people cannot tell the difference between Pepsi and Coke. Coca-Cola ran ads to combat Pepsi's ads in an incident sometimes referred to as the ''[[cola wars]]''; one of Coke's ads compared the so-called [[Pepsi challenge]] to two [[chimpanzee]]s deciding which [[tennis ball]] was furrier. Thereafter, Coca-Cola regained its leadership in the market.

[[Selena]] was a spokesperson for Coca-Cola from 1989 until the time of her death. She filmed three commercials for the company. During 1994, to commemorate her five years with the company, Coca-Cola issued special Selena coke bottles.&lt;ref&gt;Orozco, Cynthia E.

The Coca-Cola Company purchased [[Columbia Pictures]] in 1982, and began inserting Coke-product images into many of its films. After a few early successes during Coca-Cola's ownership, Columbia began to under-perform, and the studio was sold to [[Sony]] in 1989.

Coca-Cola has gone through a number of different [[advertising slogan]]s in its long history, including "The pause that refreshes", "I'd like to buy the world a Coke", and "Coke is it".

In 2006, Coca-Cola introduced [[My Coke Rewards]], a customer loyalty campaign where consumers earn points by entering codes from specially marked packages of Coca-Cola products into a website.

In Australia in 2011, Coca-Cola began the "share a Coke" campaign, where the Coca-Cola logo was replaced on the bottles and replaced with first names. Coca-Cola used the 150 most popular names in Australia to print on the bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jessica Burke |url=http://www.foodmag.com.au/news/sharing-your-coke--marketing-genius-or-just-entire |title=Sharing your Coke: marketing genius or just entirely weird? |work=Foodmag.com.au |date=September 26, 2011 |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxy.co.nz/lifestyle/whats-name/240/105315 |title=What's in a Name? |publisher=Voxy.co.nz |date=October 25, 2011 |accessdate= April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designtaxi.com/news/350737/For-Summer-Campaign-Coke-Prints-150-Popular-First-Names-on-Bottles/?page=1 |title=For Summer Campaign, Coke Prints 150 Popular First Names on Bottles |publisher=[[DesignTAXI.com]] |date=October 6, 2011 |accessdate= April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was paired with a website page, Facebook page, and an online "share a virtual Coke".

Coca-Cola has also advertised its product to be consumed as a breakfast beverage, instead of coffee or tea for the morning caffeine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/20/business/a-morning-cola-instead-of-coffee.html | title=A Morning Cola Instead of Coffee? | publisher=''The New York Times'' | date=January 20, 1988 | accessdate=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=665JAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sw4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4053,80769&amp;dq=coca-cola+breakfast | title=Soft drink for breakfast could be your cup of tea | publisher=''Bangor Daily News'' | date=November 30, 1987 | accessdate=April 9, 2013 | author=McGrath, Karen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===5 cents===

From 1886 to 1959, the price of Coca-Cola was fixed at five cents, in part due to an advertising campaign.

===Holiday campaigns===

Throughout the years, Coca-Cola has released limited time collector bottles for Christmas.

[[File:Weihnachtstruck.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Freightliner Trucks|Freightliner]] Coca-Cola Christmas truck in [[Dresden]], Germany, 2004.]]

The "Holidays are coming!" advertisement features a train of red delivery trucks, emblazoned with the Coca-Cola name and decorated with [[Christmas lights]], driving through a snowy landscape and causing everything that they pass to light up and people to watch as they pass through.&lt;ref name="Sandison"&gt;{{cite news|title=Coca-Cola revives popular 'holidays are coming' ad|author=Nikki Sandison|work=[[Brand Republic]]|date=November 16, 2007|url=http://brandrepublic.com/News/767575/Coca-Cola-revives-popular-holidays-coming-ad/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertisement fell into disuse in 2001, as the Coca-Cola company restructured its advertising campaigns so that advertising around the world was produced locally in each country, rather than centrally in the company's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Guardian  |author=Stephen Armstrong|date=May 14, 2001|url=http://guardian.co.uk./media/2001/may/14/mondaymediasection6|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|title=Coke goes for broke}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the company brought back the campaign after, according to the company, many consumers telephoned its information center saying that they considered it to mark the beginning of Christmas.&lt;ref name=Sandison /&gt; The advertisement was created by U.S. advertising agency Doner, and has been part of the company's global advertising campaign for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Coca-Cola Challenge|work=Campaign|date=October 22, 2004|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7140327_ITM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keith Law, a producer and writer of commercials for [[Belfast CityBeat]], was not convinced by Coca-Cola's reintroduction of the advertisement in 2007, saying that "I don't think there's anything Christmassy about [[Heavy Goods Vehicle|HGVs]] and the commercial is too generic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Do TV campaigns ad up?|author=Jane Hardy|date=December 27, 2007|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk./lifestyle/do-tv-campaigns-ad-up-13505247.html|work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120530045617/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/do-tv-campaigns-ad-up-13505247.html|archivedate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, singer [[Melanie Thornton]] recorded the campaign's advertising jingle as a single, ''Wonderful Dream (Holidays are Coming)'', which entered the pop-music charts in Germany at no. 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Der Spiegel|language=German|date=November 25, 2001|title=Melanie Thornton: "Ich wollte immer Musik"|url=http://spiegel.de./panorama/0,1518,169615,00.html|publisher=SPIEGELnet GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charleston native Thornton to be buried on Saturday.|work=[[The Post and Courier]]|location=Charleston, SC|date=December 7, 2001|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-2079594_ITM|author=Prentiss Findlay}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Coca-Cola expanded the advertising campaign to radio, employing several variations of the jingle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coca-Cola restructures in healthy drinks focus|author=Nicola Clark|date=November 29, 2005|work=[[Brand Republic]]|url=http://brandrepublic.com./News/530102/Coca-Cola-restructures-healthy-drinks-focus/|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708090950/http://brandrepublic.com./News/530102/Coca-Cola-restructures-healthy-drinks-focus/ |archivedate = July 8, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Coca-Cola launched a campaign for the Indian holiday [[Diwali]]. The campaign included commercials, a song, and an integration with Shah Rukh Khan's film ''[[Ra.One]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestmediainfo.com/2011/10/coca-cola-launches-its-diwali-campaign/ |title=Coca-Cola launches its Diwali campaign « Best Media Info, News and Analysis on Indian Advertising, Marketing and Media Industry |publisher=Bestmediainfo.com |date=October 13, 2011 |accessdate= April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJeC_XTBSiQ |title=Coca-Cola Diwali! |publisher=YouTube |date=November 12, 2010 |accessdate= April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Pia Heikkila |url=http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/industry-insights/media/from-bollywood-to-the-world |title=From Bollywood to the world |publisher=The National |date=May 25, 2010 |accessdate=April 23, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721134145/http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/industry-insights/media/from-bollywood-to-the-world |archivedate=July 21, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports sponsorship===
Coca-Cola was the first commercial [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]] of the Olympic games, at the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 games]] in Amsterdam, and has been an Olympics sponsor ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/sponsors/coca-cola |title=Coca-Cola|publisher=Olympic Movement|accessdate = August 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This corporate sponsorship included the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] hosted in [[Atlanta]], which allowed Coca-Cola to spotlight its hometown. Most recently, Coca-Cola has released localized commercials for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver; one Canadian commercial referred to Canada's hockey heritage and was modified after Canada won the gold medal game on February 28, 2010 by changing the ending line of the commercial to say "Now they know whose game they're playing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99msEwWpJBE |title=YouTube Post of Coca-Cola 2010 Olympic Hockey Commercial |accessdate=March 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]], Coca-Cola has sponsored the [[FIFA World Cup]], and other competitions organized by FIFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/marketing/sponsorship/partners/coca-cola.html|title=FIFA Partners - FIFA.com|last=FIFA.com|website=FIFA.com|language=en-GB|access-date=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One [[FIFA]] tournament trophy, the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup|FIFA World Youth Championship]] from Tunisia in [[1977 FIFA World Youth Championship|1977]] to Malaysia in [[1997 FIFA World Youth Championship|1997]], was called "FIFA&amp;nbsp;— Coca-Cola Cup". In addition, Coca-Cola sponsors the annual [[Coca-Cola 600]] and [[Coke Zero 400]] for the [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]] at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] in [[Concord, North Carolina]] and [[Daytona International Speedway]] in Daytona, Florida.

Coca-Cola has a long history of sports marketing relationships, which over the years have included [[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Football League]], the [[National Basketball Association]], and the [[National Hockey League]], as well as with many teams within those leagues. Coca-Cola has had a longtime relationship with the NFL's [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], due in part to the now-famous [[Hey Kid, Catch!|1979 television commercial]] featuring [[Joe Greene (American football)|"Mean Joe" Greene]], leading to the two opening the Coca-Cola Great Hall at [[Heinz Field]] in 2001 and a more recent [[Coca-Cola Zero]] commercial featuring [[Troy Polamalu]].

Coca-Cola is the official soft drink of many [[College football|collegiate football]] teams throughout the nation, partly due to Coca-Cola providing those schools with upgraded athletic facilities in exchange for Coca-Cola's sponsorship. This is especially prevalent at the high school level, which is more dependent on such contracts due to tighter budgets.

Coca-Cola was one of the official sponsors of the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]] held on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Coca-Cola is also one of the associate sponsors of [[Delhi Daredevils]] in the [[Indian Premier League]].

In England, Coca-Cola was the main sponsor of [[The Football League]] between 2004 and 2010, a name given to the three professional divisions below the [[Premier League]] in [[association football|soccer]] (football). In 2005, Coca-Cola launched a competition for the 72 clubs of The Football League&amp;nbsp;— it was called "Win a Player". This allowed fans to place one vote per day for their favorite club, with one entry being chosen at random earning £250,000 for the club; this was repeated in 2006. The "Win A Player" competition was very controversial, as at the end of the 2 competitions, [[Leeds United A.F.C.]] had the most votes by more than double, yet they did not win any money to spend on a new player for the club. In 2007, the competition changed to "Buy a Player". This competition allowed fans to buy a bottle of Coca-Cola or Coca-Cola Zero and submit the code on the wrapper on the Coca-Cola website. This code could then earn anything from 50p to £100,000 for a club of their choice. This competition was favored over the old "Win a Player" competition, as it allowed all clubs to win some money.  Between 1992 and 1998, Coca-Cola was the title sponsor of the [[Football League Cup]] (Coca-Cola Cup), the secondary cup tournament of England.

Between 1994 and 1997, Coca-Cola was also the title sponsor of the [[Scottish League Cup]], renaming it the Coca-Cola Cup like its English counterpart. From 1998 to 2001, the company were the title sponsor of the [[Northern Ireland Football League Cup|Irish League Cup]] in [[Northern Ireland]], where it was named the Coca-Cola League Cup.

Coca-Cola is the presenting sponsor of the [[Tour Championship]], the final event of the [[PGA Tour]] held each year at [[East Lake Golf Club]] in [[Atlanta]], GA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pgatour.com/tournaments/tour-championship-by-coca-cola.html|title=TOUR Championship by Coca-Cola|work=PGATour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduced March 1, 2010, in Canada, to celebrate the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], Coca-Cola sold gold colored cans in packs of 12 {{convert|355|mL|0|abbr=on}} each, in select stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coca-Cola to Release Gold Can Commemorating the 2010 Olympics|url=http://bevwire.wordpress.com/2010/03/01/coca-cola-to-release-gold-can-commemorating-the-2010-olympics/|publisher=BevWire|accessdate=March 22, 2010|date=March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coca-Cola has been prominently featured in many films and television programs. It was a major plot element in films such as [[One, Two, Three]], [[The Coca-Cola Kid]], and [[The Gods Must Be Crazy]], among many others. In music, in [[the Beatles]]' song, "[[Come Together]]", the lyrics say, "He shoot Coca-Cola", he say....

Not all musical references to Coca-Cola went well.  A line in "[[Lola (song)|Lola]]" by [[the Kinks]] was originally recorded as "You drink champagne and it tastes just like Coca-Cola."  When the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] refused to play the song because of the commercial reference, lead singer [[Ray Davies]] re-recorded the lyric as "it tastes just like cherry cola" to get airplay for the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1158 |title=Lola by The Kinks Songfacts |publisher=Songfacts.com |accessdate= April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medicinal application ==

Coca-Cola is sometimes used for the [[Coca-Cola treatment of phytobezoars|treatment]] of gastric [[phytobezoar]]s. In about 50% of cases studied, Coca-Cola alone was found to be effective in gastric phytobezoar dissolution. Unfortunately, this treatment can result in the potential of developing small bowel obstruction in a minority of cases, necessitating surgical intervention.&lt;ref name=Iwamuro2015&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Iwamuro M. |author2=Okada H. |author3=Matsueda K. |author4=Inaba T. |author5=Kusumoto C. |author6=Imagawa A. |author7=Yamamoto K. | year = 2015 | title = Review of the diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal bezoars | url = | journal = World Journal of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy | volume = 7 | issue = 4| pages = 336–345 | doi = 10.4253/wjge.v7.i4.336 |pmc=4400622 | pmid=25901212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Stomach, Definition and Patient Education |publisher=Healthline| url = http://www.healthline.com/health/stomach#Overview1 | accessdate = July 10, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of Coca-Cola}}

Criticism of Coca-Cola has arisen from various groups around the world, concerning a variety of issues, including [[health effects]], [[environmental issues]], and [[business practice]]s. The drink's coca flavoring, and the nickname "Coke", remain a common  theme of criticism due to the relationship with the illegal drug [[cocaine]]. In 1911, the US government seized 40 barrels and 20 kegs of Coca-Cola syrup in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], alleging the caffeine in its drink was "injurious to health", leading to amended food safety legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benjamin|first=Ludy T.|last2=Rogers|first2=Anne M.|last3=Rosenbaum|first3=Angela|date=January 1, 1991|title=Coca-Cola, caffeine, and mental deficiency: Harry Hollingworth and the Chattanooga trial of 1911|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1520-6696(199101)27:13.0.CO;2-1/abstract|journal=Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=42–55|doi=10.1002/1520-6696(199101)27:13.0.CO;2-1|pmid=2010614|issn=1520-6696|doi-broken-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coca-Cola Company, its subsidiaries and products have been subject to sustained criticism by both [[consumer group]]s, [[Left-wing politics|leftist activists]], and [[Consumer watchdog|watchdogs]], particularly since the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Delshad |first1=Irani |title=Is Coca-Cola an easy target?

Coca-Cola Classic is rich in sugar (or sweetners in some countries) especially [[sucrose]], which causes [[dental caries]] when consumed regularly. Besides this, the high caloric value of the sugars themselves can contribute to [[obesity]].

==Colombian death-squad allegations==

In July 2001, the Coca-Cola company was sued over its alleged use of political [[far-right]] wing [[death squads]] (the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia]]) to kidnap, torture, and kill Colombian bottler workers that were linked with trade union activity. Coca-Cola was sued in a US federal court in Miami by the Colombian food and drink union Sinaltrainal. The suit alleged that Coca-Cola was indirectly responsible for having "contracted with or otherwise directed [[paramilitary]] security forces that utilized extreme violence and murdered, tortured, unlawfully detained or otherwise silenced trade union leaders". This sparked campaigns to boycott Coca-Cola in the UK, US, Germany, Italy, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coca-Cola Accused|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/29/weekinreview/july-22-28-coca-cola-accused.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jul/24/marketingandpr.colombia |title=Coca-Cola boycott launched after killings at Colombian plants |date=July 24, 2003 |newspaper=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian |access-date=February 2, 2016|last1=Brodzinsky |first1=Sibylla }}&lt;/ref&gt; Javier Correa, the president of Sinaltrainal, said the campaign aimed to put pressure on Coca-Cola "to mitigate the pain and suffering" that union members had suffered.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

Speaking from the Coca-Cola company's headquarters in Atlanta, company spokesperson Rafael Fernandez Quiros said "Coca-Cola denies any connection to any human-rights violation of this type" and added "We do not own or operate the plants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1448962.stm |title=Coke sued over death squad claims |date=July 20, 2001 |website=bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC |access-date=February 2, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary on the controversy, titled ''The Coca-Cola Case'', was released in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/story/146579/coca_cola's_role_in_the_assassinations_of_union_leaders_explored_in_powerful_new_documentary Coca Cola's Role in the Assassinations of Union Leaders Explored in Powerful New Documentary].

Coca-Cola has a high degree of identification with the United States, being considered by some an "American Brand" or as an item representing America. During [[World War II]], this gave rise to brief production of the [[White Coke]] as a neutral brand.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/15/business/viewpoints-a-brief-history-of-coca-colonization.html|title=Viewpoints; A Brief History of Coca-Colonization|author=[[Mark Pendergrast]]|date=August 15, 1993|accessdate=September 12, 2012|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drink is also often a [[metonymy|metonym]] for the Coca-Cola Company.

Coca-Cola was introduced to China in 1927, and was very popular until 1949. After the [[Chinese Civil War]] ended in 1949, the beverage was no longer imported into China, as it was perceived to be a symbol of decadent [[Western culture]] and the [[capitalism|capitalist]] lifestyle. Importation and sales of the beverage resumed in 1979, after diplomatic relations between the United States and China were restored.&lt;ref name=weibo&gt;{{cite web|last=Koetse|first=Manya|title=Coca Cola in China|work=Marketing|publisher=whatsonweibo.com|location=Netherlands|date=September 24, 2015|url=http://www.whatsonweibo.com/coca-cola-in-china/|accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some consumer boycotts of Coca-Cola in [[Arab world|Arab countries]] due to Coke's early investment in Israel during the [[Arab League boycott of Israel]] (its competitor Pepsi stayed out of Israel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inminds.co.uk/boycott-coca-cola.html |title= Boycott Israel Campaign page on Coca-Cola|accessdate=August 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mecca Cola]] and Pepsi have been successful{{vague|date=February 2012}} alternatives in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/31/international/europe/31FRAN.html|title=They Choke on Coke, But Savor Mecca-Cola|last1= Tagliabue|first1=John |last2= |first2= |date=December 31, 2002 |website=NYTimes.com |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Coca-Cola fountain dispenser (officially a Fluids Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus or FGBA) was developed for use on the [[Space Shuttle]] as a test bed to determine if carbonated beverages can be produced from separately stored carbon dioxide, water, and flavored syrups and determine if the resulting fluids can be made available for consumption without bubble nucleation and resulting foam formation. FGBA-1 flew on [[STS-63]] in 1995 and dispensed pre-mixed beverages, followed by FGBA-2 on [[STS-77]] the next year. The latter mixed CO₂, water, and syrup to make beverages.  It supplied 1.65&amp;nbsp;liters each of Coca-Cola and Diet Coke.&lt;ref name="CokeInSpace"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum14/HTML/000692.html |title=Coke machines on-board the space shuttle |last=Pearlman |first=Robert |website=CollectSpace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Orloff |first=Richard W. |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/shuttle_pk/pk/Flight_077_STS-077_Press_Kit.pdf |title=Space Shuttle Mission STS-77 |date=January 2001 |origyear=Press Kit May 1996 |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |accessdate=June 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Common Fisheries Policy''' ('''CFP''') is the [[fishery|fisheries]] policy of the [[European Union]] (EU).  It sets quotas for which [[Member state of the European Union|member states]] are allowed to catch each type of fish, as well as encouraging the [[fishing industry]] by various market interventions. In 2004 it had a budget of €931&amp;nbsp;million, approximately 0.75% of the [[Budget of the European Union|EU budget]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

When it came into force, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] formally enshrined fisheries ''conservation'' policy as one of the handful of "exclusive competences" reserved for the European Union, to be decided by [[Qualified Majority Voting]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 3 (d) of the [http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/08/st06/st06655.en08.pdf Consolidated Treaty on the functioning of the European Union ]&lt;/ref&gt; However, general fisheries policy remains a "shared competence" of the Union and its member states.&lt;ref&gt;Article 4 (d) of the Consolidated Treaty on the functioning of the European Union&lt;/ref&gt; Thus decisions are still made primarily by the [[Council of the European Union]], as was the case previously.

The common fisheries policy was created to manage fish stock for the European Union as a whole. Article 38 of the 1957 [[Treaty of Rome]], which created the [[European Communities]] (now [[European Union]]), stated that there should be a common policy for fisheries.

==Importance of fishing==
Fishing is a relatively unimportant economic activity within the EU. It contributes generally less than 1% to gross national product. In 2007 the fisheries sector employed 141,110 fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/documentation/publications/pcp_en.pdf Employment in the fisheries sector (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, 6.4&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of fish were caught by EU countries.&lt;ref name="Main world producers 2007"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/documentation/publications/pcp_en.pdf Main world producers (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; The EU fleet has 97,000 vessels of varying sizes. [[Fish farm]]ing produced a further 1&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of fish and shellfish and employed another 85,000 people. The shortfall between fish catches and demand varies, but there is an EU trade deficit in processed fish products of €3&amp;nbsp;billion.
[[File:Fisheryexpenditure2004.png|right|250px]]

The combined EU fishing fleets land about 6 million tonnes of fish per year,&lt;ref name="Main world producers 2007"/&gt; of which about 700,000 tonnes are from [[Exclusive economic zone|UK waters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK fishermen may not win waters back after Brexit, EU memo reveals|author=Daniel Boffey|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/15/uk-fishermen-may-not-win-waters-back-after-brexit-eu-memo-reveals|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 February 2017|accessdate=3 July 2017|quote=Source: House of Lords, NAFC Marine Centre, University of the Highlands and Islands.|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's share of the overall EU fishing catch in 2014 was 752,000 tonnes, the second largest catch of any country in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-pinching-our-fish |title=Is the EU ‘pinching our fish’? |last=Milne |first=Claire |date=21 June 2017 |website=fullfact.org/ |publisher=Full Fact|access-date=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proportion is determined by the [[Fisheries Convention|London Fisheries Convention of 1964]] and by the EU's Common Fisheries Policy.

In [[Fraserburgh]], Scotland, the fishing industry creates 40% of employment and a similar figure in [[Peterhead]]. They are the EU's largest fishing ports and home to the [[pelagic]] vessel fleet. It is often in areas where other employment opportunities are limited. For this reason, community funds have been made available to fishing as a means of encouraging regional development.

The market for fish and fish products has changed in recent years. Supermarkets are now the main buyers of fish and expect steady supplies. Fresh fish sales have fallen, but demand for processed fish and prepared meals has grown. Despite this, employment in [[fish processing]] has been falling, with 60% of fish consumed in the EU coming from elsewhere. This is partly due to improvements in the ability to transport fresh fish internationally.  Competitiveness of the EU fishing industry has been affected by overcapacity and shortages of fish to catch.

===Aquaculture===
Fish farming is the fastest growing area of world food production. In 1995 it produced {{frac|1|3}} in value of world production of fish and shellfish. The main species in the EU are trout, salmon, mussels and oysters, but interest has been shown in sea bass, sea bream and turbot. Community support began in 1971 for inland fish farming, but was extended to other areas in the late 1970s. EU support covers similar areas to other land installations, but with additional concerns of technical and environmental problems caused by introducing major fish concentrations where farms are built. The industry suffers problems due to fluctuating demand for farmed fish.

==Mechanisms of the CFP==
{{Politics of the European Union}}
The CFP currently has four components:
*Regulation of production, quality, grading, packaging and labelling
*Encouraging producer organisations intended to protect fishermen from sudden market changes
*Setting minimum fish prices and financing buying up of unsold fish
*Set rules for trade with non-EU countries

===Total allowable catch (TAC)===
The CFP sets quotas for how much of each species can be caught in a certain [http://geo.ices.dk/viewer.php?add_layers=ices_ref:ices_areas ICES Statistical Area] or groups of areas on a yearly or two-yearly basis. Each country is given a quota based upon the total available (Total Allowable Catch, TAC) and their traditional share (percentage). TACs are fixed annually by the Council of Ministers. They consider proposals drawn up by the European Commission, which consults its own scientific advisers (Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee of Fisheries, STECF). STECF generally provides its advice to the European Commission taking account of the work conducted by the [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea]] (ICES). The Council of Ministers furthermore (when relevant) takes account of the views of non-EU fishing nations and the advice coming directly from ICES, which is independent of EU institutions. After quotas are fixed by the Council of Ministers, each EU member state is responsible for policing its own quota. Countries distribute their quotas among fishermen using different systems.

===Fishing controls===
The Basic Regulation sets the common principles for the EU management, under which each Member State can use different management approaches as licences, limited entry or individual fishing quota. Catches and landings must be recorded. Regulations cover the kind of fishing gear that may be used. Areas may be closed from fishing to allow stocks to recover.

A [[Minimum landing size|minimum size]] for catch led to fishermen dumping dead fish that were too small to land legally, so a minimum mesh size was introduced, which let small fish escape to replenish stocks. Choice of mesh is complicated, because mature fish of different species are naturally different sizes and require different nets.

===Structural policy and onshore fishing industry===
In 1977 an aid programme was introduced to improve the fish processing industries. This includes such things as fish filleting, salting, drying, smoking, cooking, freezing and canning.  It was intended to indirectly assist the catching industry.  There has been an attempt to introduce new technologies to the sector, improve hygiene conditions, and also fund conversions of fish processing factories to other uses.

Each country is given a target for the size of its fleet. Funding is available to assist modernisation of boats and installations, but also to buy-out fishermen to reduce the fleet size. Money is available for advertising campaigns to encourage consumption of fish species that are not over-fished, or are unfamiliar to the public. Also, grants are available to assist the industry in improving product quality and managing quotas.

===Producer organisations===
[[File:Fishing Trawler.jpg|thumb|left|The EU's fishing fleet numbers 88,000 – the second largest in the world – and can fish freely across the European Union, catching nearly six million metric tonnes a year&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp_en.htm About the Common Fisheries Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/fisheries_sector_en.htm About the Common Fisheries Policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225054421/http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/fisheries_sector_en.htm |date=25 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There are now more than 160 producer organisations (PO) in the EU. These are voluntary organisations set up by fishermen or fish farmers to assist in selling their product. Their members must include a minimum percentage of vessels in that sector, not discriminate in terms of nationality or location of their members within the EU, and must comply with other EU regulations. Organisations are required to develop plans to adjust fish catches to market demand. They may require non-members fishing in the same areas to follow the same restrictions as members.

They are empowered to take produce out of the market if prices fall below levels set by the Council of Ministers and receive compensation from the EU. Levels of compensation are set such that price falls as the amount of fish involved increases. Fish stocks may be stored and later returned to the market, or sold for animal feed. Buying-up of stocks must only be to cover occasional surpluses.

Tuna fishermen have a scheme where surplus stock is not bought up, but fishermen receive direct compensation if their income falls.

==International relations==
Fishing rights to fisheries outside the EU were significantly reduced when [[exclusive economic zone]]s were [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|defined]] in 1982. The EU has negotiated agreements to recover some of these fishing grounds in return for alternative trading rights with the EU. External trade is now affected by the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), regulated by the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).

===Areas of co-operation===
Responsibility for fisheries in the [[Baltic sea]] was shared with the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission (IBFC), to which the EU belonged until 1 January 2006.  The Commission ceased to exist on 1 January 2007.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/external_relations/rfos/ibsfc_en.htm European Commission – Fisheries – The International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission (IBSFC)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312230134/http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/external_relations/rfos/ibsfc_en.htm |date=12 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Mediterranean fishing is confined to a 12-mile (22-km) strip considered territorial waters. The EU belongs to the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna, which also makes recommendations for Mediterranean tuna. In 1994 conservation regulations were introduced banning certain fishing methods. In 1997 targets were set for tuna catches.

==Compliance==
Enforcement is the responsibility of member states, but there is a community level inspection service to ensure that member states enforce the rules within their own country. Member states are also under an obligation to ensure that their vessels observe EU agreements when operating outside the EU. The regulations are also intended to harmonise penalties for breaking the regulations in different countries.

Enforcement involves managing quotas and implementing technical measures to preserve fish stocks. Inspectors may check fishing gear and inspect the register of fish caught. The type of fish caught is checked and compared to quotas of total permitted catch for a vessel. Checks may be made in port or at sea, and using aerial photography.

Inspectors may also check fish processing factories to ensure that all fish is documented and can be traced to its source. EU inspectors check that hygiene and processing regulations in any country exporting to the EU are satisfactory and of an equal standard to controls within the EU.

Non-compliance remains a significant problem. In a number of EU fisheries, illegal fishing accounts for one-third to one-half of all catches.

==Funding provision==
Fishing was initially funded under the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF). In 1993 a separate fund was established (FIFG), the Financial Instrument for Fisheries. From 1994 to 1999 the budget for FIFG totalled 700&amp;nbsp;million ECU. Any grant from FIFG must be accompanied by a minimum contribution from the national government. A grant to business must include a proportionate contribution from the business itself. Different rates of aid are applied to different regions.

From 2007 to 2013, the [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds|European Fisheries Fund]] (EFF) will provide approximately 4.3&amp;nbsp;billion Euro to the European fishing sector. The adoption of the EFF was not uncontested, in particular by environmental groups, as it includes the possibility to fund vessel modernisation and other measures, which might increase pressure on already [[overfished]] stocks.

==Fishing and the environment==
In 1997 [[North Sea]] states and EU representatives agreed a joint approach to identifying risks to the marine environment. A precautionary approach was adopted to seek to prevent pollution before damage was caused to the environment. Studies are being undertaken to monitor stocks of all fish, not just commercially important species.

==Criticism==
The Common Fisheries Policy has been argued by certain commentators to have had disastrous consequences for the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1570439/Fishing-quotas-are-an-ecological-catastrophe.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Christopher | last=Booker | title=Fishing quotas are an ecological catastrophe | date=25 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/brunowaterfield/9604035/The_human_cost_of_the_EUs_fishing_failure/ | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=The human cost of the EU's fishing failure | date=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is contradicted by historical evidence revealing that fishing stocks have been in chronic decline over the last century as a result of intensive [[Bottom trawling|trawl fishing]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | first=Richard | last=Black | title='Profound' decline in fish stocks shown in British records | date=4 May 2010 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science_and_environment/10096649.stm |work=BBC News  | pages = | accessdate = 5 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to scientific research published in 2010, the depletion of fishing stocks is a consequence of mismanagement long before the Common Fisheries Policy came into being, a statement illustrated by the fact that British catches have declined by 94% over the last 118 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thurstan | first1 = Ruth H. | last2 = Brockington | first2 = Simon | last3 = Roberts | first3 = Callum M. | title = The effects of 118 years of industrial fishing on UK bottom trawl fisheries | journal = [[Nature Communications]] | volume = 1 | pages = 15 | publisher = [[Nature Publishing Group]] | doi = 10.1038/ncomms1013 | date = 4 May 2010 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms1013 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Common Fisheries Policy has continued the trend of ineffective fisheries management in European waters. Indeed, the Common Fisheries Policy has done little if anything to reverse the decline of European fish stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Khalilian | first1 = Setareh | last2 = Froese | first2 = Rainer | last3 = Proelss | first3 = Alexander | last4 = Requate | first4 = Till | title = Designed for failure: a critique of the Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union | journal = [[Marine Policy]] | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 1178–1182 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.marpol.2010.04.001 | date = November 2010 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2010.04.001 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common fisheries policy has been criticised by some fishermen who believe it is threatening their livelihoods.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

EU quotas can mean that fish are thrown overboard after being caught; yet as they are dead, this does not alleviate the problem as it was intended to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/6122954/EU-fisheries-minister-calls-for-an-end-to-dumping-millions-of-dead-fish.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=EU fisheries minister calls for an end to dumping millions of dead fish | first=Louise | last=Gray | date=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Common Fisheries Policy has been a major reason for countries with both substantial fish resources and small home markets, like Norway,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.euronews.com/2013/03/29/norway-and-the-eu/ | work=Euronews | title=Why isn’t Norway in the EU? | date=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Nordic States and European Unity|last = Ingebritsen|first = Christine|publisher = Cornell University Press|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Iceland and European Integration: On the Edge|last = Thorhallsson|first = Baldur|publisher = Routledge|year = 2004|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/978-1-137-56703-1_4|title=Nordic Nationalism and Right-Wing Populist Politics|last=Bergmann|first=Eirikur|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=9781137567024|pages=93–124|language=en|doi=10.1057/978-1-137-56703-1_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Danish dependencies ([[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/9/21516|title=Fish keep Faroe Islands at a distance from EU|author=|date=|website=euobserver.com|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and some other dependencies, to stay outside the European Union.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} 

=== Management ===

==== Subsidiarity ====

A common criticism of the CFP is its [[Centralisation|centralised]], top-down approach to management; although [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]] are responsible for the policy's implementation and enforcement, members have given the European Commission sole competence in the creation of proposals and the making of decisions. The Commission is not exclusively responsible for the setting of [[Total Allowable Catch|total allowable catches]]. These are proposed by the commission but ultimately determined by the Council of [Fisheries] Ministers.  Allocation of national catch quotas to Member States is on a pre-determined basis—the so-called relative stability—giving each member state pre-determined percentages of the available fishing opportunities. Although Member States hold some responsibilities, such as the distribution of quotas, it is argued that the EU retains too much authority over fisheries management. Furthermore, critics maintain that the organisation is ill-suited to the task of fisheries management as it lacks sufficient understanding of fisheries, and is too far removed from the realities of the industry to set accurate TACs and quotas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sissenwine|first=M.|author2=Symes, D.|title=Reflections on the Common Fisheries Policy|journal=EU commissioned report|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[command-and-control]] method characterised by the CFP is no longer deemed an effective form of fisheries management, and advocates of CFP reform consider a shift from traditional government to participatory third-order [[governance]], incorporating the fisheries industry and Member States, to be vital to the success of the policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sellke|first=P.|author2=Dreyer, M.|title=Enhancing Regionalisation of the Common Fisheries Policy: An Opportunity and Challenge for Participatory Fisheries Governance in the EU|journal=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association Annual Conference "Global Governance: Political Authority in Transition"|year=2011|url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p500182_index.html|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, it is suggested that the management of the CFP could be improved through the application of the theory of [[subsidiarity]]—the principle that political decisions should be handled at the lowest, least-centralised competent level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=Andrew|last2=Jeppersen |first2 = Tim|title=EU Environmental policy: adapting to the principle of subsidiarity?|journal=Environmental Policy and Governance |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=64–74 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1099-0976(200003/04)10:2&lt;64::AID-EET219&gt;3.0.CO;2-Z | date = March–April 2000 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/%28SICI%291099-0976%28200003/04%2910:2%3C64::AID-EET219%3E3.0.CO;2-Z | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsidiarity principle was introduced into EU policies as part of the 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]]; however, it does not apply to areas such as the CFP over which the [[European Economic Community|Community]] retains exclusive competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coffey|first=C.|title=Good Governance and the Common Fisheries Policy: An Environmental Perspective|journal=Institute for European Environmental Policy Report|year=2000|url=http://www.ieep.eu/assets/235/goodgovernanceandthecommonfisheriespolicy.pdf|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partial [[devolution]] of authority, for example involving Member States in the decision-making process and delegating the day-to-day management of fisheries to industry-based organisations, could potentially facilitate the inclusion of industry concerns into the CFP, involving those directly affected by the policy in management decisions and creating to a CFP which encourages compliance and collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Symes | first1 = David | last2 = Phillipson | first2 = Jeremy | title = Whatever became of social objectives in fisheries policy? | journal = [[Marine Policy]] | volume = 95 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–5 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.fishres.2008.08.001 | date = March 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2008.08.001 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The call for application of the subsidiarity principle to the CFP lies within the argument for its [[decentralisation]]. De-centralisation featured prominently in discussions related to the 2002 CFP reform, but the reform itself actually increased centralisation within the CFP, removing the right of Member States to block quota proposals and increasing the EU's role in enforcement. This increasing monopoly and disregard for the wishes of the fisheries industry led to alienation of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] and resulted in reduced compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = Tim | last2 = Hatchard | first2 = Jenny | title = The 2002 reform of the Common Fisheries Policy's system of governance—rhetoric or reality? | journal = [[Marine Policy]] | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 545–554 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/S0308-597X(03)00066-6 | date = November 2003 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-597X(03)00066-6 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of this increasingly centralised reform has proved to de-centralisation advocates that stakeholder participation in the governance process is crucial to the future success of fisheries governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Participation in Fisheries Governance|publisher=Springer|location=Netherlands|author=Hatchard, J.|authorlink=Engaging stakeholder preferences through deliberative democracy in North Sea fisheries governance|editor=T. Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some critics argue that applying the subsidiarity principle to the CFP may not improve the policy's effectiveness, as it may lead to what de Vivero ''et al.'' term the "participation paradox"—the theory that the greater the number of actors involved in the decision-making process, the less significant the contribution made by each actor, and the smaller the participatory role played in the policy process. Greater devolution within CFP decision-making may therefore silence the voice of the fisheries industry as it competes with other state, private and civil actors to whom authority is also granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Suárez de Vivero | first1 = Juan L. | last2 = Rodríguez Mateos | first2 = Juan C. | last3 = del Corral | first3 = D. Florido | title = The paradox of public participation in fisheries governance.

==History==

===1970===
{{POV section|date=July 2016}}
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
The first rules were created in 1970. The original six Common Market members realised that four countries applying to join the Common Market at that time (Britain, Ireland, Denmark including Greenland, and Norway) would control the richest fishing grounds in the world. The original six therefore drew up Council Regulation 2141/70 giving all Members equal access to all fishing waters, even though the Treaty of Rome did not explicitly include fisheries in its agriculture chapter. This was adopted on the morning of 30 June 1970, a few hours before the applications to join were officially received. This ensured that the regulations became part of the acquis communautaire before the new members joined, obliging them to accept the regulation. In its accession negotiations, the UK at first refused to accept the rules but by the end of 1971 the UK gave way and signed the Accession Treaty on 22 January 1972, thereby bringing into the CFP joint management an estimated four fifths of all the fish off Western Europe.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Norway decided not to join. Greenland left the EC in 1985, after having gained partial independence from Denmark in 1979.

When the fisheries policy was originally set up the intention was to create a free trade area in fish and fish products with common rules. It was agreed that fishermen from any state should have access to all waters, except Irish fishermen that were refused access to fish any waters east of 4 deg west, thus closing the north sea to them. An exception was made for the coastal strip, which was reserved for local fishermen who had traditionally fished those areas. A policy was created to assist modernisation of fishing vessels and on-shore installations.

===1976===
In 1976 the EC extended its fishing waters from 12 nautical miles to 200 nautical miles ({{cvt|12|nmi|km|1|disp=out}} to {{cvt|200|nmi|km|1|disp=out}}) from the coast, in line with other international changes. This required additional controls and the CFP as such was created in 1983. This now had four areas of activity: conservation of stocks, vessels and installations, market controls, and external agreements with other nations.

===1992===
It was determined that there had been over-investment in vessels, over-fishing and that numbers of fish landed were decreasing.  The review identified a need to improve compliance with the regulations. This led to a tightening of regulations and better monitoring of individual vessels. A second review was planned for 2002.

===1995===
Although fishing could be managed by reducing the fleet size, available fish vary from year to year too much to make this sensible. So a permit system was introduced stating where and when boats are allowed to fish. Scientific studies were commissioned to better-determine available stocks and guide allocation of permits.

===2009===
In 2009, the EU Commission launched a wide-ranging debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =  Common Fisheries Policy Reform | url = http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/reform/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the way that EU fisheries are managed. It received input from EU citizens, organisations and EU-countries and published a report on the consultation.

===2013===
In February 2013 the European Parliament voted for reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, including measures to protect endangered stocks, and the ending of discards. The new CFP came into effect from 1 January 2014, though more talks with EU governments are involved. In presenting the reform package, the German Social Democrat MEP Ulrike Rodust stated: "As of 2015 the principle of  [[maximum sustainable yield]] shall apply ... Our objective is that depleted fish stocks recover by 2020. Not only nature will benefit, but also fishermen: bigger stocks produce higher yields."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21352617 BBC News: Euro MPs back large-scale fishing reform to save stocks]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 reform led to a greater role for the European Parliament, involving the convening of a trilateral dialogue (or "trilogue") between the European Council, European Commission and the Parliament, to work towards general agreement on reforming the CFP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agritrade.cta.int/Fisheries/Topics/EU-common-fisheries-policy/Executive-Brief-Update-2013-EU-Common-Fisheries-Policy-and-Fisheries-Partnership-Agreements-Challenges-for-ACP-countries EU Common Fisheries Policy and Fisheries Partnership Agreements – Challenges for ACP countries.

{{Competition law}}
'''Competition law''' is a [[law]] that promotes or seeks to maintain [[market competition]] by regulating [[anti-competitive]] conduct by companies.&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2281756|title=The Role of Competition Law: An Asian Perspective|first1=Rita Yi Man|last1=Li|first2=Yi Lut|last2=Li|date=1 June 2013|publisher=|accessdate=27 June 2017|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor 2006 1"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Taylor| first = Martyn D.| title = International competition law: a new dimension for the WTO?| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2006| pages = 1| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=wTsfwxMvz_MC&amp;dq=competition+law&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-521-86389-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Competition law is implemented through public and private enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cartel Damage Claims (CDC)|title=Cartel Damage Claims (CDC)|url=http://www.carteldamageclaims.com/|website=www.carteldamageclaims.com/|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competition law is known as "[[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]]" in the [[United States]] for historical reasons, and as "anti-[[monopoly]] law" in [[China]]&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"/&gt; and [[Russia]]. In previous years it has been known as trade practices law in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]]. In the [[European Union]], it is referred to as both antitrust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/overview_en.html|title=Antitrust: Overview – Competition - European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and competition law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/consumers/agreements_en.html|title=Anti-competitive agreements – European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/competition/publications/factsheets/antitrust_procedures_101_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of competition law reaches back to the [[Roman Empire]]. The business practices of market traders, [[guild]]s and governments have always been subject to scrutiny, and sometimes severe sanctions. Since the 20th century, competition law has become global.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Topping|first1=Simon|last2=Tweedale|first2=Patrick|title=UAE Competition Law: New Regulations and Potential Effect on M&amp;A Transactions |url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/uae-competition-law-new-regulations-and-potential-effect-ma-transactions|publisher=Transaction Advisors|ISSN=2329-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two largest and most influential systems of competition regulation are [[United States antitrust law]] and [[European Union competition law]]. National and regional competition authorities across the world have formed international support and enforcement networks.

Modern competition law has historically evolved on a country level to promote and maintain fair competition in markets principally within the territorial boundaries of [[nation-states]]. National competition law usually does not cover activity beyond territorial borders unless it has significant effects at nation-state level.&lt;ref name="Taylor 2006 1"/&gt; Countries may allow for [[extraterritorial jurisdiction]] in competition cases based on so-called effects doctrine.&lt;ref name="Taylor 2006 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JG Castel, 'The Extraterritorial Effects of Antitrust Laws' (1983) 179 Recueil des Cours 9&lt;/ref&gt; The protection of international competition is governed by international competition agreements. In 1945, during the negotiations preceding the adoption of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) in 1947, limited international competition obligations were proposed within the ''Charter for an International Trade Organisation''. These obligations were not included in GATT, but in 1994, with the conclusion of the [[Uruguay Round]] of GATT Multilateral Negotiations, the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) was created. The ''Agreement Establishing the WTO'' included a range of limited provisions on various cross-border competition issues on a sector specific basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Taylor| first = Martyn D.| title = International competition law: a new dimension for the WTO?| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2006| page = 2| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=wTsfwxMvz_MC&amp;dq=competition+law&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-521-86389-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==
Competition law, or antitrust law, has three main elements:
* prohibiting agreements or practices that restrict free trading and competition between business. This includes in particular the repression of free trade caused by [[cartel]]s.
* banning abusive behavior by a firm dominating a market, or anti-competitive practices that tend to lead to such a dominant position. Practices controlled in this way may include [[predatory pricing]], [[Tying (commerce)|tying]], [[price gouging]], [[refusal to deal]], and many others.
* supervising the [[mergers and acquisitions]] of large corporations, including some [[joint venture]]s. Transactions that are considered to threaten the competitive process can be prohibited altogether, or approved subject to "remedies" such as an obligation to divest part of the merged business or to offer licenses or access to facilities to enable other businesses to continue competing.

Substance and practice of competition law varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Protecting the interests of consumers ([[welfare economics|consumer welfare]]) and ensuring that entrepreneurs have an opportunity to compete in the [[market economy]] are often treated as important objectives. Competition law is closely connected with law on deregulation of access to markets, state aids and subsidies, the [[privatization]] of state owned assets and the establishment of independent sector regulators, among other market-oriented supply-side policies. In recent decades, competition law has been viewed as a way to provide better [[public services]].&lt;ref&gt;see, [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]'s [http://www.oecd.org/department/0,3355,en_2649_34753_1_1_1_1_1,00.html Regulation and Sectors] page.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bork]] argued that competition laws can produce adverse effects when they reduce competition by protecting inefficient competitors and when costs of legal intervention are greater than benefits for the consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Bork (1993), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of competition law}}

===Roman legislation===
An early example was enacted during the [[Roman Republic]] around 50&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;This is Julius Caesar's time according to Babled in ''De La Cure Annone chez le Romains''.&lt;/ref&gt; To protect the grain trade, heavy fines were imposed on anyone directly, deliberately, and insidiously stopping supply ships.&lt;ref name="Wilberforce 1966 p. 20"&gt;Wilberforce (1966) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Diocletian]] in 301 A.D., an [[Edict on Maximum Prices|edict]] imposed the death penalty for anyone violating a tariff system, for example by buying up, concealing, or contriving the scarcity of everyday goods.&lt;ref name="Wilberforce 1966 p. 20"/&gt; More legislation came under the constitution of [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] of 483 A.D., which can be traced into Florentine municipal laws of 1322 and 1325.&lt;ref&gt;Wilberforce (1966) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; This provided for confiscation of property and banishment for any trade combination or joint action of monopolies private ''or'' granted by the Emperor. Zeno rescinded all previously granted exclusive rights.&lt;ref name="Wilberforce 1966 p. 21"&gt;Wilberforce (1966) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justinian I]] subsequently introduced legislation to pay officials to manage state monopolies.&lt;ref name="Wilberforce 1966 p. 21"/&gt;

===Middle Ages===
Legislation in England to control monopolies and restrictive practices was in force well before the [[Norman Conquest]].&lt;ref name="Wilberforce 1966 p. 21"/&gt; The [[Domesday Book]] recorded that "[[Engrossing (law)|foresteel]]" (i.e. forestalling, the practice of buying up goods before they reach market and then inflating the prices) was one of three [[Asset forfeiture|forfeitures]] that [[King Edward the Confessor]] could carry out through England.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Pollock]] and [[Frederic William Maitland|Maitland]], ''History of English Law'' Vol. II, 453&lt;/ref&gt; But concern for fair prices also led to attempts to directly regulate the market. Under [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] an act was passed in 1266&lt;ref&gt;51 &amp; 52 Hen. 3, Stat. 1&lt;/ref&gt; to fix bread and ale prices in correspondence with grain prices laid down by the [[assize]]s. Penalties for breach included [[amercement]]s, [[pillory]] and [[cucking stool|tumbrel]].&lt;ref&gt;51 &amp; 52 Hen. 3, Stat. 6&lt;/ref&gt; A 14th century statute labelled forestallers as "oppressors of the poor and the community at large and enemies of the whole country".&lt;ref&gt;Wilberforce (1966) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]] the [[Statute of Labourers 1351|Statute of Labourers]] of 1349&lt;ref&gt;23 Edw. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; fixed wages of artificers and workmen and decreed that foodstuffs should be sold at reasonable prices. On top of existing penalties, the statute stated that overcharging merchants must pay the injured party double the sum he received, an idea that has been replicated in [[Punitive damages|punitive]] [[treble damages]] under [[US antitrust law]]. Also under Edward III, the following statutory provision outlawed trade combination.&lt;ref&gt;27 Edw. 3, Stat. 2, c. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;we have ordained and established, that no merchant or other shall make Confederacy, Conspiracy, Coin, Imagination, or Murmur, or Evil Device in any point that may turn to the Impeachment, Disturbance, Defeating or Decay of the said Staples, or of anything that to them pertaineth, or may pertain.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In continental Europe, competition principles developed in ''[[lex mercatoria]]''. Examples of legislation enshrining competition principles include the ''constitutiones juris metallici'' by [[Wenceslaus II]] of [[Bohemia]] between 1283 and 1305, condemning combination of ore traders increasing prices; the Municipal Statutes of Florence in 1322 and 1325 followed [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]]'s legislation against state monopolies; and under [[Emperor Charles V]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] a law was passed "to prevent losses resulting from monopolies and improper contracts which many merchants and artisans made in the Netherlands". In 1553, [[Henry VIII of England]] reintroduced tariffs for foodstuffs, designed to stabilize prices, in the face of fluctuations in supply from overseas. So the legislation read here that whereas,

&lt;blockquote&gt;it is very hard and difficult to put certain prices to any such things&amp;nbsp;... [it is necessary because] prices of such victuals be many times enhanced and raised by the Greedy Covetousness and Appetites of the Owners of such Victuals, by occasion of ingrossing and regrating the same, more than upon any reasonable or just ground or cause, to the great damage and impoverishing of the King's subjects.&lt;ref&gt;25 Hen. 8, c. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Around this time organizations representing various tradesmen and handicrafts people, known as [[guild]]s had been developing, and enjoyed many concessions and exemptions from the laws against monopolies. The privileges conferred were not abolished until the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.

===Early competition law in Europe===
[[File:Edward coke.jpg|thumb|Judge [[Edward Coke|Coke]] in the 17th century thought that general restraints on trade were unreasonable.]]
The English common law of [[restraint of trade]] is the direct predecessor to modern competition law later developed in the US.&lt;ref&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;the modern common law of England [has] passed directly into the legislation and thereafter into the judge-made law of the United States." Wilberforce (1966) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the prohibition of agreements that ran counter to public policy, unless the [[Reasonable person|reasonableness]] of an agreement could be shown. It effectively prohibited agreements designed to restrain another's trade. The 1414 ''Dyer's'' is the first known restrictive trade agreement to be examined under English common law. A dyer had given a bond not to exercise his trade in the same town as the plaintiff for six months but the plaintiff had promised nothing in return. On hearing the plaintiff's attempt to enforce this restraint, Hull J exclaimed, "per Dieu, if the plaintiff were here, he should go to prison until he had paid a fine to the King". The court denied the collection of a bond for the dyer's breach of agreement because the agreement was held to be a restriction on trade.&lt;ref&gt;(1414) 2 Hen. 5, 5 Pl. 26&lt;/ref&gt; English courts subsequently decided a range of cases which gradually developed competition related case law, which eventually were transformed into [[statute law]].&lt;ref name="Papadopoulos 2010 7"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Papadopoulos| first = Anestis S| title = The International Dimension of EU Competition Law and Policy | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2010| page = 7 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BpCqNMPNxeoC&amp;dq=eu+competition+law| isbn = 978-0-521-19646-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elizabeth I (Armada Portrait).jpg|thumb|left|Elizabeth I assured monopolies would not be abused in the early era of [[globalization]].]]
Europe around the 16th century was changing quickly. The [[new world]] had just been opened up, overseas trade and plunder was pouring wealth through the international economy and attitudes among businessmen were shifting. In 1561 a system of Industrial Monopoly Licenses, similar to modern [[patent]]s had been introduced into England. But by the reign of [[Queen Elizabeth I]], the system was reputedly much abused and used merely to preserve privileges, encouraging nothing new in the way of innovation or manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;according to [[William Searle Holdsworth]], 4 Holdsworth, 3rd ed., Chap. 4 p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; In response English courts developed case law on restrictive business practices. The statute followed the unanimous decision in ''Darcy v. Allein'' 1602, also known as the [[Case of Monopolies]],&lt;ref&gt;(1602) 11 Co. Rep. 84b&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[King's bench]] to declare void the sole right that Queen Elizabeth I had granted to Darcy to import playing cards into England.&lt;ref name="Papadopoulos 2010 7"/&gt;  Darcy, an officer of the Queen's household, claimed damages for the defendant's infringement of this right. The court found the grant void and that three characteristics of [[monopoly]] were (1) price increases, (2) quality decrease, (3) the tendency to reduce artificers to idleness and beggary. This put an end to granted monopolies until [[James I of England|King James I]] began to grant them again. In 1623 Parliament passed the [[Statute of Monopolies]], which for the most part excluded [[patent]] rights from its prohibitions, as well as guilds. From [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], through the civil war and to [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], monopolies continued, especially useful for raising revenue.&lt;ref&gt;For example one John Manley paid p.a. from 1654 to the Crown for a tender on the "postage of letters both inland and foreign" Wilberforce (1966) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1684, in ''East India Company v. Sandys'' it was decided that exclusive rights to trade only outside the realm were legitimate, on the grounds that only large and powerful concerns could trade in the conditions prevailing overseas.&lt;ref&gt;(1685) 10 St. Tr. 371&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of early competition law in England and Europe progressed with the diffusion of writings such as ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' by [[Adam Smith]], who first established the concept of the ''[[market economy]]''. At the same time [[industrialisation]] replaced the individual [[artisan]], or group of artisans, with paid labourers and machine-based production. Commercial success increasingly dependent on maximising production while minimising cost. Therefore, the size of a company became increasingly important, and a number of European countries responded by enacting laws to regulate large companies which restricted trade. Following the [[French Revolution]] in 1789 the law of 14–17 June 1791 declared agreements by members of the same trade that fixed the price of an industry or labour as void, unconstitutional, and hostile to liberty. Similarly the Austrian Penal Code of 1852 established that "agreements ... to raise the price of a commodity ... to the disadvantage of the public should be punished as misdemeanours". Austria passed a law in 1870 abolishing the penalties, though such agreements remained void. However, in Germany laws clearly validated agreements between firms to raise prices. Throughout the 18th and 19th century, ideas that dominant private companies or legal monopolies could excessively restrict trade were further developed in Europe. However, as in the late 19th century, a depression spread through Europe, known as the [[Panic of 1873]], ideas of competition lost favour, and it was felt that companies had to co-operate by forming [[cartels]] to withstand huge pressures on prices and profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Papadopoulos| first = Anestis S| title = The International Dimension of EU Competition Law and Policy | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2010| pages =8–9 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BpCqNMPNxeoC&amp;dq=eu+competition+law| isbn = 978-0-521-19646-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern competition law==
While the development of competition law stalled in Europe during the late 19th century, in 1889 [[Canada]] enacted what is considered the first competition statute of modern times. The ''Act for the Prevention and Suppression of Combinations formed in restraint of Trade'' was passed one year before the United States enacted the most famous legal statute on competition law, the [[Sherman Act]] of 1890. It was named after [[Senator John Sherman]] who argued that the Act "does not announce a new principle of law, but applies old and well recognised principles of common law."&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Papadopoulos| first = Anestis S| title = The International Dimension of EU Competition Law and Policy | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2010| pages =9–10 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BpCqNMPNxeoC&amp;dq=eu+competition+law| isbn = 978-0-521-19646-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States antitrust===
{{Main article|United States antitrust law}}
[[File:Senatorial Round House by Thomas Nast 1886.jpg|thumb|left|Senatorial Round House by [[Thomas Nast]], 1886]]
The [[Sherman Act]] of 1890 attempted to outlaw the restriction of competition by large companies, who co-operated with rivals to fix outputs, prices and market shares, initially through ''pools'' and later through ''trusts''. Trusts first appeared in the US railroads, where the capital requirement of railroad construction precluded competitive services in then scarcely settled territories. This trust allowed railroads to discriminate on rates imposed and services provided to consumers and businesses and to destroy potential competitors. Different trusts could be dominant in different industries. The [[Standard Oil Company]] trust in the 1880s controlled a number of markets, including the market in [[fuel oil]], [[lead]] and [[whiskey]].&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; Vast numbers of citizens became sufficiently aware and publicly concerned about how the trusts negatively impacted them that the Act became a priority for both major parties. A primary concern of this act is that competitive markets themselves should provide the primary regulation of prices, outputs, interests and profits. Instead, the Act outlawed anticompetitive practices, codifying the common law restraint of trade doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Papadopoulos| first = Anestis S| title = The International Dimension of EU Competition Law and Policy | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2010| page =11 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BpCqNMPNxeoC&amp;dq=eu+competition+law| isbn = 978-0-521-19646-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof Rudolph Peritz has argued that competition law in the United States has evolved around two sometimes conflicting concepts of competition: first that of individual liberty, free of government intervention, and second a fair competitive environment free of excessive economic power. Since the enactment of the Sherman Act enforcement of competition law has been based on various economic theories adopted by Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Papadopoulos| first = Anestis S| title = The International Dimension of EU Competition Law and Policy | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2010| page =12 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BpCqNMPNxeoC&amp;dq=eu+competition+law| isbn = 978-0-521-19646-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 1 of the Sherman Act declared illegal "every contract, in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations." Section 2 prohibits [[monopolies]], or attempts and conspiracies to monopolize. Following the enactment in 1890 US court applies these principles to business and markets. Courts applied the Act without consistent economic analysis until 1914, when it was complemented by the [[Clayton Act]] which specifically prohibited exclusive dealing agreements, particularly tying agreements and interlocking directorates, and mergers achieved by purchasing stock. From 1915 onwards the ''[[rule of reason]]'' analysis was frequently applied by courts to competition cases. However, the period was characterized by the lack of competition law enforcement. From 1936 to 1972 courts' application of anti-trust law was dominated by the ''[[Industrial organization#Structure, conduct, performance|structure-conduct-performance]]'' paradigm of the Harvard School. From 1973 to 1991, the enforcement of anti-trust law was based on efficiency explanations as the Chicago School became dominant, and through legal writings such as Judge [[Robert Bork]]'s book ''[[The Antitrust Paradox]]''. Since 1992 [[game theory]] has frequently been used in anti-trust cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Papadopoulos| first = Anestis S| title = The International Dimension of EU Competition Law and Policy | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2010| pages =11–12 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BpCqNMPNxeoC&amp;dq=eu+competition+law| isbn = 978-0-521-19646-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union law===
{{Main article|European Union competition law}}
Competition law gained new recognition in Europe in the inter-war years, with Germany enacting its first anti-cartel law in 1923 and Sweden and Norway adopting similar laws in 1925 and 1926 respectively. However, with the [[Great Depression]] of 1929 competition law disappeared from Europe and was revived following the [[Second World War]] when the United Kingdom and Germany, following pressure from the United States, became the first European countries to adopt fully fledged competition laws. At a regional level [[EU competition law]] has its origins in the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) agreement between France, [[Italy]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]] and Germany in 1951 following the Second World War. The agreement aimed to prevent Germany from re-establishing dominance in the production of [[coal]] and [[steel]] as it was felt that this dominance had contributed to the outbreak of the war. Article 65 of the agreement banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations, or mergers, and the abuse of a dominant position by companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Papadopoulos| first = Anestis S| title = The International Dimension of EU Competition Law and Policy | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2010| pages =12–13 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BpCqNMPNxeoC&amp;dq=eu+competition+law| isbn = 978-0-521-19646-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time that competition law principles were included in a [[plurilateral]] regional agreement and established the trans-European model of competition law. In 1957 competition rules were included in the [[Treaty of Rome]], also known as the EC Treaty, which established the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC). The Treaty of Rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the EEC through the "institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted." The two central provisions on EU competition law on companies were established in article 85, which prohibited anti-competitive agreements, subject to some exemptions, and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position. The treaty also established principles on competition law for member states, with article 90 covering public undertakings, and article 92 making provisions on state aid. Regulations on mergers were not included as member states could not establish consensus on the issue at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Papadopoulos| first = Anestis S| title = The International Dimension of EU Competition Law and Policy | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2010| page =14 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BpCqNMPNxeoC&amp;dq=eu+competition+law| isbn = 978-0-521-19646-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] prohibits anti-competitive agreements in Article 101(1), including [[price fixing]]. According to Article 101(2) any such agreements are automatically void. Article 101(3) establishes exemptions, if the collusion is for distributional or technological innovation, gives consumers a "fair share" of the benefit and does not include unreasonable restraints that risk eliminating competition anywhere (or compliant with the [[general principle of European Union law]] of [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]]). Article 102 prohibits the abuse of [[dominance (economics)|dominant position]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vandenborre|first1=Ingrid|last2=Goetz|first2=Thorsten|last3=Dionnet|first3=Stephane|title=EU Nonmerger Antitrust Enforcement Gets Stricter|url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/eu-nonmerger-antitrust-enforcement-gets-stricter|publisher=Transaction Advisors|ISSN=2329-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as price discrimination and exclusive dealing. Article 102 allows the [[European Council]] [[European Union regulation|regulations]] to govern mergers between firms (the current regulation is the [[European Union merger law|Regulation 139/2004/EC]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R0139:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 32004R0139 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general test is whether a concentration (i.e. merger or acquisition) with a community dimension (i.e. affects a number of EU member states) might significantly impede [[effective competition]]. Articles 106 and 107 provide that member state's right to deliver public services may not be obstructed, but that otherwise public enterprises must adhere to the same competition principles as companies. Article 107 lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidize private parties in distortion of free competition and provides exemptions for [[charities]], regional development objectives and in the event of a [[natural disaster]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

India responded positively by opening up its economy by removing controls during the [[Economic liberalisation in India|Economic liberalisation]]. In quest of increasing the efficiency of the nation's economy, the [[Government of India]] acknowledged the [[Liberalization]] [[Privatization]] [[Globalization]] era. As a result, Indian market faces competition from within and outside the country.&lt;ref name="Competition"&gt;Warrier VS, Conflict between Competition Law and Intellectual Property Rights [http://lex-warrier.in/2010/09/competition-law-and-ipr/ Citation: 2010 (1) LW 2] The Lex-Warrier: Online Law Journal, {{ISSN|2319-8338}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the need of a strong legislation to dispense justice in commercial matters and [[the Competition Act, 2002]] was passed. The history of competition law in India dates back to the 1960s when the first competition law, namely the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act (MRTP) was enacted in 1969. But after the economic reforms in 1991, this legislation was found to be obsolete in many aspects and as a result, a new competition law in the form of [[the Competition Act, 2002]] was enacted in 2003. The [[Competition Commission of India]], is the quasi judicial body established for enforcing provisions of the Competition Act.&lt;ref name="CCI formation"&gt;{{cite web|title=CCI formation|url=http://www.cci.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=18|publisher=CCI|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International expansion===
By 2008 111 countries had enacted competition laws, which is more than 50 percent of countries with a population exceeding 80,000 people. 81 of the 111 countries had adopted their competition laws in the past 20 years, signaling the spread of competition law following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and the expansion of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Papadopoulos| first = Anestis S| title = The International Dimension of EU Competition Law and Policy | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2010| page =15 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BpCqNMPNxeoC&amp;dq=eu+competition+law| isbn = 978-0-521-19646-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently [[Competition Authority (disambiguation)|competition authorities]] of many states closely co-operate, on everyday basis, with foreign counterparts in their enforcement efforts, also in such key area as information / evidence sharing.&lt;ref&gt;Marek Martyniszyn, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2436467 Inter-Agency Evidence Sharing in Competition Law Enforcement], 19(1) International Journal of Evidence and Proof 11 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WTO members and observers.svg|right|thumb|There is considerable controversy among [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] members, in green, whether competition law should form part of the agreements]]
At a national level competition law is enforced through competition authorities, as well as private enforcement. The [[United States Supreme Court]] explained:&lt;ref&gt;''Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of California'', {{ussc|405|251|1972}}, 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every violation of the antitrust laws is a blow to the free-enterprise system envisaged by Congress. This system depends on strong competition for its health and vigor, and strong competition depends, in turn, on compliance with antitrust legislation. In enacting these laws, Congress had many means at its disposal to penalize violators. It could have, for example, required violators to compensate federal, state, and local governments for the estimated damage to their respective economies caused by the violations. But, this remedy was not selected. Instead, Congress chose to permit all persons to sue to recover three times their actual damages every time they were injured in their business or property by an antitrust violation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[European Union]], the Modernisation Regulation 1/2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R0001:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 32003R0001 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; means that the [[European Commission]] is no longer the only body capable of public enforcement of [[European Union competition law]].

Some EU Member States enforce their competition laws with criminal sanctions.

Antitrust administration and legislation can be seen as a balance between:
* guidelines which are clear and specific to the courts, regulators and business but leave little room for discretion that prevents the application of laws from resulting in unintended consequences.
* guidelines which are broad, hence allowing administrators to sway between improving economic outcomes versus succumbing to political policies to redistribute wealth.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Office of Fair Trading]] Director and Professor Richard Whish wrote sceptically that it "seems unlikely at the current stage of its development that the WTO will metamorphose into a global competition authority."&lt;ref&gt;Whish (2003) p. 448&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that, at the ongoing [[Doha round]] of trade talks for the [[World Trade Organization]], discussion includes the prospect of competition law enforcement moving up to a global level. While it is incapable of enforcement itself, the newly established [[International Competition Network]]&lt;ref&gt;see, http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (ICN) is a way for national authorities to coordinate their own enforcement activities.

==Theory==
{{Main article|Competition law theory}}

===Classical perspective===
{{See also|Classical economics}}

Under the doctrine of [[laissez-faire]], antitrust is seen as unnecessary as competition is viewed as a long-term dynamic process where firms compete against each other for market dominance. In some markets a firm may successfully dominate, but it is because of superior skill or innovativeness. However, according to laissez-faire theorists, when it tries to raise prices to take advantage of its monopoly position it creates profitable opportunities for others to compete. A process of [[creative destruction]] begins which erodes the monopoly. Therefore, government should not try to break up monopoly but should allow the market to work.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell R. McConnell, Stanley L. Brue. Economics: Principles, Problems, and Policies. McGraw-Hill Professional, 2005. pp. 601–02&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John-stuart-mill-sized.jpg|right|thumb|[[John Stuart Mill]] believed the [[restraint of trade]] doctrine was justified to preserve [[liberty]] and [[competition]].]]
The classical perspective on competition was that certain agreements and business practice could be an unreasonable restraint on the [[individual liberty]] of tradespeople to carry on their livelihoods. Restraints were judged as permissible or not by courts as new cases appeared and in the light of changing business circumstances. Hence the courts found specific categories of agreement, specific clauses, to fall foul of their doctrine on economic fairness, and they did not contrive an overarching conception of market power. Earlier theorists like Adam Smith rejected any monopoly power on this basis.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A monopoly granted either to an individual or to a trading company has the same effect as a secret in trade or manufactures. The monopolists, by keeping the market constantly under-stocked, by never fully supplying the effectual demand, sell their commodities much above the natural price, and raise their emoluments, whether they consist in wages or profit, greatly above their natural rate.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1776) Book I, Chapter 7, para 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776) [[Adam Smith]] also pointed out the cartel problem, but did not advocate specific legal measures to combat them.

&lt;blockquote&gt;People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices. It is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings, by any law which either could be executed, or would be consistent with liberty and justice. But though the law cannot hinder people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together, it ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies; much less to render them necessary.&lt;ref name="Book I, Chapter 10"&gt;Smith (1776) Book I, Chapter 10, para 82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the latter half of the 19th century it had become clear that large firms had become a fact of the market economy. [[John Stuart Mill]]'s approach was laid down in his treatise ''[[On Liberty]]'' (1859).

&lt;blockquote&gt;Again, trade is a social act. Whoever undertakes to sell any description of goods to the public, does what affects the interest of other persons, and of society in general; and thus his conduct, in principle, comes within the jurisdiction of society... both the cheapness and the good quality of commodities are most effectually provided for by leaving the producers and sellers perfectly free, under the sole check of equal freedom to the buyers for supplying themselves elsewhere. This is the so-called doctrine of Free Trade, which rests on grounds different from, though equally solid with, the principle of individual liberty asserted in this Essay. Restrictions on trade, or on production for purposes of trade, are indeed restraints; and all restraint, qua restraint, is an evil...&lt;ref&gt;Mill (1859) Chapter V, para 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Neo-classical synthesis===
{{See also|Neoclassical synthesis}}
[[File:Paul Samuelson.gif|right|thumb|[[Paul Samuelson]], author of the 20th century's most successful economics text, combined mathematical models and [[Keynesian]] macroeconomic intervention. He advocated the general success of the market but backed the American government's antitrust policies.]]
After Mill, there was a shift in economic theory, which emphasized a more precise and theoretical model of competition. A simple neo-classical model of free markets holds that production and distribution of goods and services in competitive free markets maximizes [[social welfare]]. This model assumes that new firms can freely enter markets and compete with existing firms, or to use legal language, there are no [[barriers to entry]]. By this term economists mean something very specific, that competitive free markets deliver [[allocative efficiency|allocative]], [[productive efficiency|productive]] and dynamic efficiency. Allocative efficiency is also known as [[Pareto efficiency]] after the Italian economist [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and means that resources in an economy over the [[long run]] will go precisely to those who are [[Consumerism|willing]] and [[Poverty|able]] to pay for them. Because rational producers will keep producing and selling, and buyers will keep buying up to the last [[Marginalism|marginal unit]] of possible output – or alternatively rational producers will be reduce their output to the margin at which buyers will buy the same amount as produced – there is no waste, the greatest number wants of the greatest number of people become satisfied and [[Utilitarianism|utility]] is perfected because resources can no longer be reallocated to make anyone better off without making someone else worse off; society has achieved allocative efficiency. Productive efficiency simply means that society is making as much as it can. Free markets are meant to reward those who [[Protestant work ethic|work hard]], and therefore those who will put society's resources towards the [[Production possibility frontier|frontier of its possible production]].&lt;ref&gt;for one of the opposite views, see [[Kenneth Galbraith]], ''[[The New Industrial State]]'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamic efficiency refers to the idea that business which constantly competes must research, create and innovate to keep its share of consumers. This traces to Austrian-American political scientist [[Joseph Schumpeter]]'s notion that a "perennial gale of creative destruction" is ever sweeping through [[capitalism|capitalist]] economies, driving enterprise at the market's mercy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Schumpeter]], ''The Process of Creative Destruction'' (1942)&lt;/ref&gt; This led Schumpeter to argue that monopolies did not need to be broken up (as with [[Standard Oil]]) because the next gale of economic innovation would do the same.

Contrasting with the allocatively, productively and dynamically efficient market model are monopolies, oligopolies, and cartels. When only one or a few firms exist in the market, and there is no credible threat of the entry of competing firms, prices rise above the competitive level, to either a monopolistic or oligopolistic equilibrium price. Production is also decreased, further decreasing [[social welfare]] by creating a [[deadweight loss]]. Sources of this market power are said{{By whom|date=October 2009}} to include the existence of [[externalities]], [[barriers to entry]] of the market, and the [[free rider problem]]. Markets may [[market failure|fail]] to be efficient for a variety of reasons, so the exception of competition law's intervention to the rule of ''[[laissez faire]]'' is justified if [[government failure]] can be avoided. Orthodox economists fully acknowledge that [[perfect competition]] is seldom observed in the real world, and so aim for what is called "[[workable competition]]."&lt;ref&gt;Whish (2003), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=John M. |year=1940 |month= |title=Towards a Concept of Workable Competition |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=241–56 |jstor=1807048 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This follows the theory that if one cannot achieve the ideal, then go for the second best option&lt;ref&gt;c.f. {{cite journal |last=Lipsey |first=R.

A group of economists and lawyers, who are largely associated with the [[University of Chicago]], advocate an approach to competition law guided by the proposition that some actions that were originally considered to be anticompetitive could actually promote competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hovenkamp |first=Herbert |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1985 |month= |title=Antitrust Policy after Chicago |journal=Michigan Law Review |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=213–84 |doi=10.2307/1289065|publisher=The Michigan Law Review Association |jstor=1289065}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] has used the Chicago School approach in several recent cases.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc.]]'', {{ussc|433|36|1977}}; ''[[Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.]]'', {{ussc|441|1|1979}}; ''[[National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v.

Trinko]]'', {{ussc|540|398|2004}}; ''[[Leegin Creative Leather Products Inc. v. PSKS Inc.]]'', 551 U.S. ___ (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; One view of the Chicago School approach to antitrust is found in United States Circuit Court of Appeals Judge [[Richard Posner]]'s books ''Antitrust Law''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Antitrust Law |last=Posner |first=R. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |edition=2nd |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-67576-9 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Economic Analysis of Law''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Economic Analysis of Law |last=Posner |first=R. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |edition=7th |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business |location=Austin, TX |isbn=978-0-7355-6354-4 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Bork]] was highly critical of court decisions on United States antitrust law in a series of law review articles and his book ''[[The Antitrust Paradox]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Antitrust Paradox |last=Bork |first=Robert H. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1978 |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |isbn=0-465-00369-9 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bork argued that both the original intention of antitrust laws and economic efficiency was the pursuit ''only'' of consumer welfare, the protection of competition rather than competitors.&lt;ref name="Bork1978p405"&gt;Bork (1978), p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, only a few acts should be prohibited, namely cartels that fix prices and divide markets, mergers that create monopolies, and dominant firms pricing predatorily, while allowing such practices as vertical agreements and price discrimination on the grounds that it did not harm consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Bork (1978), p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; Running through the different critiques of US antitrust policy is the common theme that government interference in the operation of free markets does more harm than good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Easterbrook |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Easterbrook |coauthors= |year=1984 |month= |title=The Limits of Antitrust |journal=Texas Law Review |volume=63 |issue= |page=1 |issn=0040-4411 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The only cure for bad theory," writes Bork, "is better theory."&lt;ref name="Bork1978p405" /&gt; The late [[Harvard Law School]] Professor [[Philip Areeda]], who favours more aggressive antitrust policy, in at least one Supreme Court case challenged Robert Bork's preference for non-intervention.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brooke Group v.

===Collusion and cartels===
{{Main article|Collusion|Cartel}}
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|right|thumb|[[Scottish Enlightenment]] philosopher [[Adam Smith]] was an early enemy of cartels.]]

===Dominance and monopoly===
{{Main article|Dominance (economics)|Monopoly}}
[[File:Monopoly-surpluses.svg|thumb|right|The economist's depiction of [[deadweight loss]] to efficiency that monopolies cause]]
When firms hold large market shares, consumers risk paying higher prices and getting lower quality products than compared to competitive markets. However, the existence of a very high market share does not always mean consumers are paying excessive prices since the threat of new entrants to the market can restrain a high-market-share firm's price increases. Competition law does not make merely having a monopoly illegal, but rather abusing the power that a monopoly may confer, for instance through exclusionary practices.

First it is necessary to determine whether a firm is dominant, or whether it behaves "to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors, customers and ultimately of its consumer."&lt;ref&gt;C-27/76 ''United Brands Continental BV v. Commission'' [1978] ECR 207&lt;/ref&gt; Under EU law, very large market shares raise a presumption that a firm is dominant,&lt;ref&gt;C-85/76 ''Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co AG v. Commission'' [1979] ECR 461&lt;/ref&gt; which may be rebuttable.&lt;ref&gt;''AKZO'' [1991]&lt;/ref&gt; If a firm has a dominant position, then there is "a special responsibility not to allow its conduct to impair competition on the common market."&lt;ref&gt;''Michelin'' [1983]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly as with collusive conduct, market shares are determined with reference to the particular market in which the firm and product in question is sold. Then although the lists are seldom closed,&lt;ref&gt;''Continental Can'' [1973]&lt;/ref&gt; certain categories of abusive conduct are usually prohibited under the country's legislation. For instance, limiting production at a shipping port by refusing to raise expenditure and update technology could be abusive.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 82 (b) ''Porto di Genova'' [1991]&lt;/ref&gt; Tying one product into the sale of another can be considered abuse too, being restrictive of consumer choice and depriving competitors of outlets. This was the alleged case in ''Microsoft v. Commission''&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62004B0201(02):EN:NOT Case T-201/04] ''Microsoft v. Commission'' Order, 22 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; leading to an eventual fine of  million for including its [[Windows Media Player]] with the [[Microsoft Windows]] platform. A refusal to supply a facility which is essential for all businesses attempting to compete to use can constitute an abuse. One example was in a case involving a medical company named ''[[Commercial Solvents]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Commercial Solvents]]'' [1974]&lt;/ref&gt; When it set up its own rival in the [[tuberculosis]] drugs market, Commercial Solvents were forced to continue supplying a company named Zoja with the raw materials for the drug. Zoja was the only market competitor, so without the court forcing supply, all competition would have been eliminated.

Forms of abuse relating directly to pricing include price exploitation. It is difficult to prove at what point a dominant firm's prices become "exploitative" and this category of abuse is rarely found. In one case however, a French funeral service was found to have demanded exploitative prices, and this was justified on the basis that prices of funeral services outside the region could be compared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;numdoc=61987J0030&amp;lg=en C-30/87] ''Corinne Bodson v. SA Pompes funèbres des régions libérées'' [1987] ECR 2479&lt;/ref&gt; A more tricky issue is [[predatory pricing]]. This is the practice of dropping prices of a product so much that one's smaller competitors cannot cover their costs and fall out of business. The [[Chicago School (economics)]] considers predatory pricing to be unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g. Posner (1998) p. 332; "While it is possible to imagine cases in which predatory pricing would be a rational stragy, it should be apparent by now why confirmed cases of it are rare."&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''France Telecom SA v. Commission''&lt;ref&gt;Case T-340/03 ''France Telecom SA v. Commission''&lt;/ref&gt; a broadband internet company was forced to pay $13.9 million for dropping its prices below its own production costs. It had "no interest in applying such prices except that of eliminating competitors"&lt;ref&gt;''AKZO'' [1991] para 71&lt;/ref&gt; and was being cross-subsidized to capture the lion's share of a booming market. One last category of pricing abuse is [[price discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;in the EU under Article 82(2)c)&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this could be offering rebates to industrial customers who export your company's sugar, but not to customers who are selling their goods in the same market as you are in.&lt;ref&gt;''Irish Sugar'' [1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mergers and acquisitions===
{{Main article|Mergers and acquisitions}}
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Aoltw.jpg|thumb|The world's biggest ever [[merger]], valued at $165,747,000,000 was between [[AOL]] and [[Time Warner]] in 2000]] --&gt;
A merger or acquisition involves, from a competition law perspective, the concentration of economic power in the hands of fewer than before.&lt;ref&gt;Under EC law, a concentration is where a "change of control on a lasting basis results from (a) the merger of two or more previously independent undertakings... (b) the acquisition... if direct or indirect control of the whole or parts of one or more other undertakings." Art. 3(1), Regulation 139/2004, the [[European Community Merger Regulation]]&lt;/ref&gt; This usually means that one firm buys out the [[share (finance)|shares]] of another. The reasons for oversight of economic concentrations by the state are the same as the reasons to restrict firms who abuse a position of dominance, only that regulation of mergers and acquisitions attempts to deal with the problem before it arises, ''ex ante'' prevention of market dominance.&lt;ref&gt;In the case of [T-102/96] ''Gencor Ltd v. Commission'' [1999] ECR II-753 the EU [[Court of First Instance]] wrote merger control is there "to avoid the establishment of market structures which may create or strengthen a dominant position and not need to control directly possible abuses of dominant positions"&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States merger regulation began under the Clayton Act, and in the European Union, under the Merger Regulation 139/2004 (known as the "ECMR").&lt;ref&gt;The authority for the Commission to pass this regulation is found under Art. 83 TEC&lt;/ref&gt; Competition law requires that firms proposing to merge gain authorization from the relevant government authority. The theory behind mergers is that transaction costs can be reduced compared to operating on an open market through bilateral contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coase |first=Ronald H.|authorlink=Ronald H. Coase |date=November 1937 |title=The Nature of the Firm |journal=Economica |volume=4 |issue=16|pages=386–405 |url=http://www.cerna.ensmp.fr/Enseignement/CoursEcoIndus/SupportsdeCours/COASE.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2007-02-10 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070113063048/http://www.cerna.ensmp.fr/Enseignement/CoursEcoIndus/SupportsdeCours/COASE.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 13 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrations can increase [[economies of scale]] and scope. However often firms take advantage of their increase in market power, their increased market share and decreased number of competitors, which can adversely affect the deal that consumers get. Merger control is about predicting what the market might be like, not knowing and making a judgment. Hence the central provision under EU law asks whether a concentration ''would'', if it went ahead, "significantly impede effective competition... in particular as a result of the creation or strengthening off a dominant position..."&lt;ref&gt;Art. 2(3) Reg. 129/2005&lt;/ref&gt; and the corresponding provision under US antitrust states similarly,

&lt;blockquote&gt;No person shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital... of the assets of one or more persons engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce, where... the effect of such acquisition, of such stocks or assets, or of the use of such stock by the voting or granting of proxies or otherwise, may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton Act Section 7, codified at {{usc|15|18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What amounts to a substantial lessening of, or significant impediment to competition is usually answered through empirical study. The market shares of the merging companies can be assessed and added, although this kind of analysis only gives rise to presumptions, not conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;see, for instance para 17, ''Guidelines on the assessment of horizontal mergers'' (2004/C 31/03)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Herfindahl index|Herfindahl-Hirschman Index]] is used to calculate the "density" of the market, or what concentration exists. Aside from the maths, it is important to consider the product in question and the rate of technical innovation in the market.&lt;ref&gt;C-68/94 ''France v. Commission'' [1998] ECR I-1375, para. 219&lt;/ref&gt; A further problem of collective dominance, or [[oligopoly]] through "economic links"&lt;ref&gt;''Italian Flat Glass'' [1992] ECR ii-1403&lt;/ref&gt; can arise, whereby the new market becomes more conducive to [[collusion]]. It is relevant how transparent a market is, because a more concentrated structure could mean firms can coordinate their behavior more easily, whether firms can deploy deterrents and whether firms are safe from a reaction by their competitors and consumers.&lt;ref&gt;T-342/99 ''Airtours plc v. Commission'' [2002] ECR II-2585, para 62&lt;/ref&gt; The entry of new firms to the market, and any barriers that they might encounter should be considered.&lt;ref&gt;''Mannesmann, Vallourec and Ilva'' [1994] CMLR 529, OJ L102 21 April 1994&lt;/ref&gt; If firms are shown to be creating an uncompetitive concentration, in the US they can still argue that they create efficiencies enough to outweigh any detriment, and similar reference to "technical and economic progress" is mentioned in Art. 2 of the ECMR.&lt;ref&gt;see the argument put forth in Hovenkamp H (1999) ''Federal Antitrust Policy: The Law of Competition and Its Practice'', 2nd Ed, West Group, St. Paul, Minnesota. Unlike the authorities however, the courts take a dim view of the efficiencies defense.&lt;/ref&gt; Another defense might be that a firm which is being taken over is about to fail or go insolvent, and taking it over leaves a no less competitive state than what would happen anyway.&lt;ref&gt;''Kali und Salz AG v. Commission'' [1975] ECR 499&lt;/ref&gt; Mergers vertically in the market are rarely of concern, although in ''AOL/Time Warner''&lt;ref&gt;''Time Warner/AOL'' [2002] 4 CMLR 454, OJ L268&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Commission]] required that a joint venture with a competitor [[Bertelsmann]] be ceased beforehand. The EU authorities have also focused lately on the effect of [[conglomerate merger]]s, where companies acquire a large portfolio of related products, though without necessarily dominant shares in any individual market.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''Guinness/Grand Metropolitan'' [1997] 5 CMLR 760, OJ L288; Many in the US disapprove of this approach, see W. J. Kolasky, ''Conglomerate Mergers and Range Effects: It's a long way from Chicago to Brussels'' 9 November 2001, Address before George Mason University Symposium Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual property, innovation and competition===
Competition law has become increasingly intertwined with [[intellectual property]], such as [[copyright]], [[trademark]]s, [[patent]]s, [[industrial design right]]s and in some jurisdictions [[trade secret]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/hearings/ip/222655.pdf |title=Antitrust Enforcement and Intellectual Property Rights: Promoting Innovation and Competition |date=April 2007 |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that promotion of [[innovation]] through enforcement of intellectual property rights may promote as well as limit competitiveness. The question rests on whether it is legal to acquire monopoly through accumulation of intellectual property rights. In which case, the judgment needs to decide between giving preference to intellectual property rights or to competitiveness:
* Should antitrust laws accord special treatment to intellectual property.
* Should intellectual rights be revoked or not granted when antitrust laws are violated.

Concerns also arise over anti-competitive effects and consequences due to:
* Intellectual properties that are collaboratively designed with consequence of violating antitrust laws (intentionally or otherwise).
* The further effects on competition when such properties are accepted into industry standards.
* Cross-licensing of intellectual property.
* Bundling of intellectual property rights to long term business transactions or agreements to extend the market exclusiveness of intellectual property rights beyond their statutory duration.
* [[Trade secrets]], if they remain a secret, having an eternal length of life.

Some scholars suggest that a prize instead of patent would solve the problem of deadweight loss, when innovators got their reward from the prize, provided by the government or non-profit organization, rather than directly selling to the market, see [[Millennium Prize Problems]]. However innovators may accept the prize only when it is at least as much as how much they earn from patent, which is a question difficult to determine.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Scotchmer: "Innovation and Incentives" the MIT press, 2004 (Chapter 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Credit Reporting Privacy Code''' (CRPC) was issued by the Privacy Commissioner Marie Shroff on 6 December 2004. It is one of several Codes of Practice issued by the Privacy Commissioner under section 46 of the [[Right to privacy in New Zealand#Privacy Act 1993|Privacy Act]].

The Code has been amended 6 times, with a 7th amendment pending, with the amendments as follows:

* Amendment No 1 – 1 April 2006 (now expired)
* Amendment No 2 – 1 April 2006
* Amendment No 3 – 22 February 2010; 
* Amendment No 4 – 1 October 2011 and 1 April 2012
* Amendment No 5 – 1 December 2011 and 1 April 2012
* Amendment No 6 – 1 April 2012

The Code replaces the Privacy Act’s 12 Privacy Principles, with 12 Privacy Rules specifically customised for [[credit reporting]] matters.

==Summary of the Code==

The Code regulates into law matters related to credit reporting. The Code is however only limited to credit reporters that actually sell credit information, so at current the Code only applies to 3 credit reporting firms, [[Veda (NZ)|Veda Limited]], [[Dun &amp; Bradstreet]] Limited, and recent newcomer Centrix Group Limited.

One of the most important aspects of the Code is that individuals now have the right to a free copy of their credit record. Not only that, individuals also have a right to a copy of all their Credit Information, which includes not only includes the normal credit record, but also other things such as a copy of your [[credit score]], access log, and even the credit reporters internal file notes.

Other things the Code covers is procedures to handle complaints, maintaining an access log to your credit record, maximum time frames to report bad debts, credit inquiries, etc., having adequate subscriber agreements, allowing certain inquiries to your credit record without a consent being required, prohibiting debt collection agencies from bad debt listing debts under their account, requiring credit suppression where a person is a victim of identity fraud, and most recently, allowing positive reporting.

==The 12 Privacy Rules of the Code==

Rule 1: Purpose of Collection of Credit Information
Rule 2: Source of Credit Information
Rule 3: Collection of Credit Information from Individual
Rule 4: Manner of Collection of Credit Information
Rule 5: Storage and Security of Credit Information
Rule 6: Access to Credit Information 
Rule 7: Correction of Credit Information
Rule 8: Accuracy, etc., of Credit Information
Rule 9: Retention of Credit Information
Rule 10: Limits on Use of Credit Information
Rule 11: Limits on Disclosure of Credit Information 
Rule 12: Unique Identifiers

==Rule 1: Purpose of Collection of Credit Information==

Personal information must not be collected by a credit reporter unless the information is collected for a lawful purpose connected with a function or activity of the credit reporter and also that the collection of the information is necessary for that purpose.

Also a credit reporter must not collect personal information for the purpose of credit reporting unless it is Credit Information as defined under the Code, so such things as criminal records and ethnicity can not be included on a credit check.

==Rule 2: Source of Credit Information==

Where a credit reporter collects credit information, it must collect the information directly from the individual concerned, unless the credit reporter believes, on reasonable grounds:
(a)	that the information is publicly available information; 
(b)	that the individual concerned authorises collection of the information from another source; 
(c)	that it is required for any investigation under the law by any public sector agency, including the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution, and punishment of offences;
(d)	that it is required for the collection of fines or taxes
(e)	for the conduct of proceedings before any court or tribunal (being proceedings that have been commenced or are reasonably in contemplation); 
(f)	the collection is from a debt collector that is enforcing a debt owed by the individual concerned

This Rule effectively lets the credit reporter to update someone’s new address if it is supplied by other sources than from a normal credit inquiry.

==Rule 3: Collection of Credit Information from Individual==

Where a credit reporter such as Veda collects credit information directly from the individual concerned, such as a request for a copy of your own credit report, the credit reporter must take such steps (if any) as are, in the circumstances, reasonable to ensure that the individual concerned is aware of:

(a)	the fact that the information is being collected; 
(b)	the purposes for which the information is being collected; 
(c)	the intended recipients of the information;
(d)	the name and address of;
(i)	the agency that is collecting the information; and
(ii)	the agency that will hold the information;
(e)	whether or not the supply of the information is voluntary or mandatory and if mandatory the particular law (if any) under which it is required;
(f)	the consequences (if any) for that individual if all or any part of the requested information is not provided; and
(g)	the rights of access to, and correction of, credit information held by the credit reporter provided by rules 6 and 7.

A credit reporter must conspicuously display on the credit reporter’s website a statement that sets out the purposes for which it collects credit information and the purposes for which the information will be used and disclosed.

It is worth noting that the credit reporter can not update your credit record with information you supply (e.g. residential address) supplied by the individual in order to get a copy of your own credit record, unless the individual consents to this. However such a consent is hidden in most credit reporters official application forms.

==Rule 4: Manner of Collection of Credit Information==

This rule states that Credit information must not be collected by a credit reporter by either unlawful means,	by means that, in the circumstances of the case, are unfair or intrude to an unreasonable extent upon the personal affairs of the individual concerned.

==Rule 5: Storage and Security of Credit Information==

A credit reporter that holds credit information must ensure that the information is protected, by such security safeguards as it is reasonable in the circumstances to take, against loss, unauthorised access and use, as well as any other misuse, including misuse by anyone with authorised access such as a subscriber.

That if it is necessary for the information to be given to a person in connection with the provision of a service to the credit reporter, everything reasonably within the power of the credit reporter is done to prevent unauthorised use or unauthorised disclosure of the information.

A credit reporter must take the following measures to safeguard the credit information it holds against unauthorised access or misuse:
(a)	develop written policies and procedures to be followed by its employees, agents and contractors; 
(b)	impose access authentication controls such as the use of passwords, credential tokens or other mechanisms; 
(c)	provide information and training to ensure compliance with the policies, procedures and controls; 
(d)	ensure that a subscriber agreement that complies with Schedule 3 is in place before disclosing information under rule 11(2); 
(e)	monitor usage and regularly check compliance with the agreement, policies, procedures and controls and the requirements of this code; 
(f)	identify and investigate possible breaches of the agreement, policies, procedures and controls; 
(g)	take prompt and effective action in respect of any breaches that are identified; 
(h)	systematically review the effectiveness of the policies, procedures and controls and promptly remedy any deficiencies; and 
(i)	maintain an access log.

The access log required by subrule (2)(i) must include a record of the time, date, subscriber purpose in relation to each access and must identify, or provide a means to identify, the specific user and must also include a record of the time, date, subscriber purpose in relation to each access and must identify, or provide a means to identify, the specific user.

==Rule 6: Access to Credit Information==

This rules states that an individual has the right of access to all of their Credit Information held by a credit reporter, and when provided with this information, the credit reporter must advise the individual that under rule 7, the individual may request the correction of that information.

The Code and the Privacy Commissioner have made it quite clear that an individual has the right of access to ones Credit information, and not just merely one’s credit report, as Credit information (as defined under the Code) includes far more information, such as an access log, credit score, and even the credit reporters internal file notes.

While the Privacy Act does not allow a credit reporter to refuse an access request due to not using an official application form, unfortunately most creditor reporters do not abide by this. Legally, all they need is your full name, and your date of birth to identify your credit record, plus some ID to legally obtain your credit record.

Furthermore, section 7 of the Code states that the credit reporter is not able to charge for providing this information, unless the individual requests the information be provided within 5 working days, in which case a reasonable charge may be made.

Despite the Code expressly stating the 5 working days, credit reporter both Veda and Dun &amp; Bradstreet instead use a time period of 20 working days contrary to this law.

==Rule 7: Correction of Credit Information==

Where a credit reporter holds credit information, the individual concerned is entitled to both request correction of the information; and to request that there be attached to the information a statement of the correction sought but not made.

A credit reporter that holds credit information must, if so requested by the individual concerned or on its own initiative, take such steps (if any) to correct that information as are, in the circumstances, reasonable to ensure that, having regard to the purposes for which the information may lawfully be used, the information is accurate, up to date, complete, and not misleading.

With regards to disputed debts, the Code requires the credit reporter at the very least flag it on its database as "disputed" (but still listed). Alternatively, the Credit reporter can remove the bad debt listing altogether. However the Privacy Commissioner has made it quite clear that if they merely flag it as "disputed", may mitigate the harm but does not constitute a correction under the law.

==Rule 8: Accuracy, etc, of Credit Information==

A credit reporter that holds credit information must not use or disclose that information without taking such steps (if any) as are, in the circumstances, reasonable to ensure that, having regard to the purpose for which the information is proposed to be used or disclosed, the information is accurate, up to date, complete, relevant, and not misleading.

A credit reporter must, when undertaking a comparison of personal information with other personal information for the purpose of producing or verifying information about an identifiable individual, take such measures as are reasonably practicable to avoid the incorrect matching of the information.

A credit reporter must ensure that a subscriber agreement that complies with Schedule 3 is in place before disclosing information under rule 11(2) as well as	establish and maintain controls to ensure that, as far as reasonably practicable, only information that is accurate, up to date, complete, relevant, and not misleading is used or disclosed;

==Rule 9: Retention of Credit Information==

A credit reporter that holds credit information must not keep that information for longer than is required for the purposes for which the information may lawfully be used, with Schedule 1 of the Code effectively stating the maximum time periods that credit information can be included on credit records.

The main maximum time periods are:

Repayment History Information – 2 years (for positive credit reporting)
Credit Applications – 5 years
Previous Inquiries – 5 years
Defaults / Collections – 5 years from the date of default
Court Judgments – 5 years
Bankruptcy – 5 years from the date of discharge, but where a person has been bankrupted more than once, it can be reported indefinitely

==Rule 10: Limits on Use of Credit Information==

Under Rule 10, a credit reporter that holds credit information that was obtained in connection with one purpose must not use the information for any other purpose unless the credit reporter believes, on reasonable grounds:
(a)	that the source of the information is a publicly available publication;
(b)	that the use of the information for that other purpose is authorised by the individual concerned;
(c)	that non-compliance is necessary to avoid prejudice to the maintenance of the law by any public sector agency, such as the Police, the IRD, or  for the conduct of proceedings before any court or tribunal (being proceedings that have been commenced or are reasonably in contemplation)

==Rule 11: Limits on Disclosure of Credit Information==

Under Rule 11, a credit reporter that holds credit information must not disclose the information unless the credit reporter believes, on reasonable grounds that the disclosure is authorised by the individual concerned (e.g. such as in a credit agreement) and is made to only a credit provider for the purposes of making a credit decision, by a prospective landlord, by a prospective employer where the position involves significant financial risk, or by a prospective insurance company.

Authorisation must be express and fully informed. It is not sufficient for a subscriber to simply notify an individual that a credit check will be undertaken as part of a credit application process. The authorisation need not be in writing, but the absence of written evidence may present a problem if the credit reporter is later required to prove that it believed on reasonable grounds that an authorisation existed.

Also, a credit reporting agency can disclose credit information to the Police, any enforcing Government agency, the IRD, and if required for any court proceedings, without the requiring of the individuals consent.

==Rule 12: Unique Identifiers==

To allay  "Big Brother" concerns, Rule 12 states that a credit reporter must not assign a unique identifier to an individual unless the assignment of that identifier is necessary to enable the credit reporter to carry out one or more of its functions efficiently (i.e. an internal reference number).

This reference number can not be the same used by any other organisation. However, the code has been since amended that a Credit reporter can now retain an individual’s drivers licence number.

==Criticism of the Code==

The Code has several shortfalls such as:
*	If you pay for your credit record, and find incorrect information, there is no legal obligation whatsoever for the credit reporter to refund the fee.
*	The credit reporters subscribers are not even required to take the simple step notify the individual that a bad listing has been listed on your credit record. This is particularly troublesome where an account is in dispute and you will only find out if it has been listed on your credit record, through applying for credit, or paying the credit reporter for a credit monitoring service. One would imagine this gives the credit reporter a financial incentive to not keep accurate or open records.
*	Furthermore, also when a bad debt listing occurs, one would think it is prudent for the subscriber to also at least notify the individual what information has been listed on their credit record, such as the date of default and the amount claimed as owed, just in case it is incorrect.
*	In cases where a bad listing has proven to have been wrongly listed, the Code does not even require that any money wrongly paid to the creditor due to the bad debt listing to be refunded.
*	Furthermore, where a subscriber or credit reporter has proven to of wrongly listed credit information, the Code does not require any of the sometimes substantial costs the individual may incur to get this information corrected to be reimbursed.
*	While the Code specifically covers Credit Information, and not merely just credit records, the Code does not prohibit credit providers misleading individuals that they are only entitled to a copy of their credit report, as exhibited by both Veda’s website and their application form.

The Privacy Commission is well aware of these shortfall’s, and whilst the Commissioner has made numerous amendments to this Code in the past, she has chosen not to rectify any of these shortfalls in the Code.

The '''Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Act (1943)''' was federal Australian law passed on 26 January 1943 which extended the area in which the [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] were obliged to serve from Australia and its territories to the South-Western Pacific Zone (SWPZ),  a triangle bounded by the equator and the [[110th meridian east|110th]] and [[159th meridian east|159th meridians]] of longitude, for the duration of the war and up to six months of Australia ceasing to be involved in hostilities. 

==History of the Act==
On 20 October 1939, a decade after the [[James Scullin|Scullin]] government abolished universal military training, and some six weeks after Australia had entered World War II, Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] issued a press statement announcing the reintroduction of compulsory military training with effect from 1 January 1940. The arrangements required unmarried men turning 21 in the call up period to undertake three months training with the Militia. Under the ''Defence Act (1903)'', they could not be compelled to serve outside Australia or its territories. For this purpose, a separate, volunteer force, the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) was raised for service overseas. 

Then [[List of Australian Opposition Leaders|Leader of the Opposition]] and leader of the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP), [[John Curtin]], voiced his opposition in Parliament to the move by the Menzies’ Government and reiterated ALP opposition to compulsory military service overseas. 

However, as Prime Minister, Curtin sought to amend the ALP platform in order to allow members of the Militia to serve overseas. There were several reasons for this. For the purpose of military efficiency, the Commander in Chief, Sir [[Thomas Blamey]] had transferred large numbers of combat-experienced officers from the AIF to the Militia; the limits on where conscripts could serve hampered military planning; and there were large numbers of American conscripts arriving in Australia to assist in its defence. Despite rumours at the time, there is no evidence that Generals Blamey or [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] or the United States government ever recommended any change to the Australian government but there was vocal criticism of the government's policy in parliament led by [[Arthur Fadden]]. 

Curtin argued that:&lt;blockquote&gt;The US had saved Australia, and the Government had had a desperate fight to get aid for Australia. He did not want to live those months again. Now the position was that there was a barrage of criticism in Australia and United States was directed at Australia that it would have Americans defend Darwin, but not Australians fight for the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/31/chapters/06.pdf Australia in the War of 1939–1945, Series 4 (Civil), Volume II – The Government and the People, 1942–1945, p. 337]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 5 January 1943 the Federal Conference of the ALP passed the following compromise resolution:&lt;blockquote&gt;That, having regard to the paramount necessity of Australia's defence, the Government be authorised to add to the definition of the territories to which the Defence Act extends the following words: ‘and such other territories in the South-west Pacific Area as the Governor-General proclaims as being territories associated with the defence of Australia’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/fact-sheets/fs162.aspx  National service and war, 1939–45 – National Archive of Australia Fact sheet 162]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

War Cabinet approved a bill to give effect to the motion on 26 January 1943. The bill provided for the use of Australian conscripts in the South-Western Pacific Zone (SWPZ) during the period of war. It also provided that this approval would lapse within six months of Australia ceasing to be involved in hostilities. Efforts by the opposition to amend the bill to allow the [[Governor General]] to alter the zone by proclamation, and by Labor MPs to add a clause requiring a [[referendum]] failed.

==Effect of the Act==
The overall military effect of the amendment was not great, as the Militia could already serve in Australian territories and it only extended the limits slightly. In the event, only a few militiamen served outside Australian territory, at [[Merauke]] in Dutch [[Western New Guinea]] and in the British [[Solomon Islands]].

      <comment>Noted that H1B1 visas are not dual intent. See 9 FAM 402.10-10(A)(a)(U)</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5211">'''Dual intent''' is a [[United States]] immigration law concept.  It generally refers to the fact that certain U.S. visas allow foreigners to be temporarily present in the U.S. with lawful status and immigrant intent.  This allows those visa holders, particularly H-1B professionals, to enter the U.S. while simultaneously seeking [[Permanent residence (United States)|lawful permanent resident status]] (green card status) at a port of entry.  Otherwise, visa holders may be presumed to have immigrant intent and can be kept from entry (summarily excluded) as a matter of law.  

If immigrant intent is presumed based upon inferences made by consular or [[Department of Homeland Security]]'s border review, this is grounds for termination of non-immigrant visas issued, refusal of the visa application, refusal of admission at the port of entry, refusal of readmission, or removal (deportation).  Further, if a border or consular official believes that a visa holder is intentionally misrepresenting himself, then the applicant for entry into the U.S. can also be permanently barred for [[visa fraud]].  Unless the foreigner holds a dual intent type visa, (s)he is subject to review for immigrant intent on each visit to the United States.

Certain types of foreign visitors are allowed dual intent, and other categories of visitors are not. Persons with [[H-1B visa]]s (for specialty workers and their spouses and minor children with [[H-4 visa]]s), [[K-1 visa|K visa]]s (for fiancees or foreign spouses of US citizens and their minor children), [[L-1 visa|L visa]]s (for corporate transferees &amp; their spouses and minor children), and [[V visa]]s (spouses and minor children of [[Permanent residency|lawful permanent residents]]) are permitted to have dual intent under the Immigration and Nationality Act.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.f6da51a2342135be7e9d7a10e0dc91a0/?vgnextoid=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&amp;CH=act&lt;/ref&gt; Federal regulations also appear to recognize dual intent [[O-1 visa|O visa]]s (for workers who have extraordinary ability and their spouses and minor children), [[P visa]]s (for athletes, artists or entertainers and their spouses and minor children), and [[E-2 visa|E visa]]s (for treaty traders or treaty investors and their spouses and minor children).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanlaw.com/dintent.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most other foreign visitors and workers, like those on [[H-2B visa|H-2B]] worker, H-3 trainee/worker, [[B-1 visa|B-1]] business, [[B-2 visa|B-2]] tourist, [[Visa Waiver Program|VWP]] visitor, [[F visa|F-1]] student, [[J-1 visa|J-1]] exchange visitor, [[M-1 visa|M-1]] student, journalism, and entertainer visas should not have immigrant intent, as discussed above.  Such visa holders can be denied admission if the consular or port official reasonably believes that they have interest in permanently remaining in the United States (i.e., in pursuing a [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green card]]). Certain activities may appear likely to lead to U.S. permanent resident status in the belief of an experienced Government Official.  

While similar to the H-1B visa, the H-1B1 visa (for Chilean and Singaporean nationals) is not dual intent. &lt;ref&gt;https://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM040210.html&lt;/ref&gt;

One such questionable situation is an upcoming marriage with a U.S. citizen without a K-1 fiance visa.   

Some confuse an example of immigrant intent presented in a footnote within the Foreign Affairs Manual.  This footnote is called the 30- to 60-day rule.  This relates to the presumption of immigration fraud by consular officials.[http://www.asianjournal.com/?c=129&amp;a=13053&amp;sid=b3bb02aa4219d1ec91fc97b32be830a2] If a person enters on a non-immigrant visa, such as a B-2 visa, but soon after works without USCIS authorization or marries a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, then a consular official may presume visa fraud and deny all future visa applications. This 30- to 60-day concept has little to do with dual intent.  This footnote guides consular officials on the intention of the U.S. government to deter those from entering, who intend to abuse the non-immigrant visa system based upon Immigration and Naturalization Sections 214(b) or 212(a)(6)(C)(i).

There are times when individuals who are married to U.S. citizens are allowed into the U.S. on tourist visas or visa waivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://london.usembassy.gov/faq-imm-proc.html Visa FAQs Immigrant Visa Process and Interview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710052423/http://london.usembassy.gov/faq-imm-proc.html |date=July 10, 2010 }} Embassy of the United States, London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; Such applicants for entry must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the consular or port official that their trip is temporary.  That is, that they are likely to return to their country of citizenship, because they have no interest in immigrating for the purposes of the entry in question. 

Most visas, including B-1/B-2 and Visa Waivers, do not allow dual intent.

The '''Energy Charter Treaty''' ('''ECT''') is an international agreement which establishes a multilateral framework for cross-border cooperation in the [[energy industry]]. The treaty covers all aspects of commercial energy activities including trade, transit, investments and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. The treaty is legally binding and includes dispute resolution procedures.&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/energy/external_dimension_enlargement/l27028_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the Energy Charter process aimed to integrate the [[energy sector]]s of the [[Soviet Union]] and Eastern Europe at the end of the [[Cold War]] into the broader European and world markets. Its role, however, extends beyond East-West cooperation and through legally binding instruments strives to promote principles of openness of global energy markets and non-discrimination to stimulate [[foreign direct investment]]s and global cross-border trade.

Awards and settlements of the [[international arbitration]]s put forward by breaking the [[international law|law]] of the Energy Charter Treaty are sometimes in the hundreds of millions of dollars. In 2014, the nearly 10-year-long [[Yukos shareholders vs. Russia|Yukos]] case was decided in favour of the claimants on the basis of the treaty, with a record-breaking $50 billion award.

Full versions of the treaty, both consolidated and official, can be found [http://www.energycharter.org/process/energy-charter-treaty-1994/energy-charter-treaty/ here].

==History==

===European Energy Charter===

The beginnings of the Energy Charter date back to a political initiative launched in Europe in the early 1990s. The end of the [[Cold War]] offered an unprecedented opportunity to overcome previous economic divisions between the nations on both sides of the [[Iron Curtain]]. The brightest prospect for mutually co-dependent beneficial cooperation was the [[Energy industry|energy sector]], given [[Russia in the European energy sector|Europe's growing energy demand]] and [[Energy superpower|vast resource availability in post-Soviet nations]]. Additionally, there was a recognised need to establish a commonly accepted foundation for energy cooperation among the states of [[Eurasia]]. By these considerations, the Energy Charter process was born.&lt;ref name=konoplyanik&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The original European Energy Charter declaration was signed in [[The Hague]] on 17 December 1991. It was a political declaration of principles for international energy cooperation in trade, transit and investment, together with the intention to negotiate a legally binding Treaty, setting the beginning of the development of the Energy Charter Treaty. One of the final hurdles was to find language to ensure national sovereignty over natural resources while enshrining the principle of international cooperation to allow outside access to those resources. Negotiators also succeeded in assuring Austria and Switzerland that they would not bear an undue transit burden for energy resources.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Goldsmith (22 November 1991), [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/22/business/worldbusiness/22iht-ec__2.html To Help Soviets Tap Vast Resources: 36 Nations Agree on Energy Charter] "[[International Herald Tribune]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy Charter Treaty===

The treaty is a legally binding multilateral agreement covering investment promotion and protection, trade, transit, energy efficiency and dispute resolution. The treaty was signed in Lisbon in December 1994, together with a "protocol on [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and related environmental aspects" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20131024073327/http://www.encharter.org/fileadmin/user_upload/document/EN.pdf#page=141 PEEREA]).
The treaty and the protocol came into effect in April 1998. An amendment to the trade-related provisions reflecting the change from the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] to [[World Trade Organization]] processes was also agreed at that time.&lt;ref name=konoplyanik/&gt;

===International Energy Charter===

The International Energy Charter is a non-binding political declaration underpinning key principles for international energy cooperation. The declaration attempts to reflect the changes in the energy world that have emerged since the development of the original Energy Charter Treaty in the early 1990s. The International Energy Charter was signed on 20 May 2015, by 72 Countries plus the EU, [[European Atomic Energy Community|Euratom]] and [[Economic Community of West African States|ECOWAS]] at a Ministerial conference hosted by the government of The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=72 Countries plus the EU, Euratom, and ECOWAS Adopt the International Energy Charter |url=http://www.energycharter.org/news/article/72-countries-plus-the-eu-euratom-and-ecowas-adopt-the-international-energy-charter/?tx_news_pi1%255Bcontroller%255D=News&amp;tx_news_pi1%255Baction%255D=detail&amp;cHash=6c41bf6940672cf5b390ced07fc5b0e5 |accessdate=2015-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001233843/http://www.energycharter.org/news/article/72-countries-plus-the-eu-euratom-and-ecowas-adopt-the-international-energy-charter/?tx_news_pi1%255Bcontroller%255D=News&amp;tx_news_pi1%255Baction%255D=detail&amp;cHash=6c41bf6940672cf5b390ced07fc5b0e5 |archivedate=1 October 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy Charter Conference==

Article 33 of the treaty establishes the Energy Charter Conference, which is the governing and decision-making body of the Organisation&lt;ref&gt;https://energycharter.org/fileadmin/DocumentsMedia/Legal/ECTC-en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and has [[United Nations General Assembly observers]] status in the resolution 62/75 adopted by the General Assembly on 6 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/62/75&lt;/ref&gt; Members consist of Countries and Regional Economic Integration Organisations that have signed or acceded to the treaty and are represented in the Conference and its subsidiary bodies. The Conference meets on a regular basis to discuss issues affecting energy cooperation among Members and to review the implementation of the treaty and PEEREA provisions, and to consider new activities within the Energy Charter framework. The Energy Charter Conference has following subsidiary bodies:

*Strategy Group
*Implementation Group
*Budget Committee
*Legal Advisory Committee

Additionally, a consultative board—the Industry Advisory Panel—presents the private sector's views on relevant issues related to energy investments, cross-border flows and energy efficiency to the Conference and its groups.

The Legal Advisory Task Force was set up by the Energy Charter Secretariat in 2001 to assist in the drafting of balanced and legally coherent Model Agreements for cross-border oil and gas pipelines.

==Legal scope of the treaty==
The treaty's provisions focus on four broad areas: [[Energy Trade]], Investment, [[Efficient energy use|Energy Efficiency]], [[Dispute resolution|Dispute Settlement]], Energy Transit.

===Trade===
The Energy Charter Treaty's purpose in [[Energy Trade]] is to create open and non-discriminatory energy markets throughout its member states. This framework follows the rules of the multilateral trading system as embodied in the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), which later became the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).
The Energy Charter Treaty extends the GATT and later the WTO rules in the energy sector amongst its members. Additionally the treaty covers the trade of all energy materials (e.g. [[Petroleum|crude oil]], natural gas, [[wood fuel]], etc.) all final energy products (e.g. petroleum, electricity, etc.) and energy-related equipment. The rules of trade only cover trade in goods, not trade in [[Tertiary sector of the economy|services]], nor does it concern itself with intellectual property rights.

===Investment===
The treaty is responsible for the protection of [[foreign direct investment]]. Its provisions protect investors and their investments from political risks involved in investing into a foreign country such as [[Economic discrimination#Against businesses|discrimination]], [[expropriation]], [[Nationalization|nationalisation]], [[breach of contract]], damages due to war, etc. The legally binding nature of the Energy Charter Treaty makes it the world's only [[Multilateral treaty|multilateral framework]] for matters specifically related to Energy.

===Dispute settlement===
Whereas Article 27 sets out the provisions for dispute resolution between two contracting states, Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty provides express provisions for resolving disputes arising under the treaty between an investor of a Contracting State and another Contracting State. The choice of arbitration rules are:

* [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|ICSID]] Rules
* ICSID Additional Facilities Rules
* [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law|UNCITRAL]] ''Ad hoc'' Rules
* The Arbitration Rules of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce

The most significant claims against Russia, pertaining to the Yukos decision, arose under the provisions of Article 26.

The drafting of the treaty has raised some difficult questions in the area of Investor-State Disputes by academics&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Roe, Matthew Happold and James Dingemans QC, Settlement of Investor-State Disputes under the Energy Charter Treaty (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been called ambiguous at instances by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encharter.org/fileadmin/user_upload/document/Petrobart.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Some areas of discussion are:

* the standards of protection granted by the treaty;
* the international responsibility of States for breaches of the treaty;
* the various procedures available for the vindication of rights under the treaty;
* the conditions to be satisfied before a claimant's complaint may be considered on the merits;
* the impact of EU law on claims under the treaty; and
* the treaty's provisions concerning taxation.

===Energy efficiency===
The Energy Charter's involvement in matters of [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and its relation to a cleaner environment was introduced in the 1991 European Energy Charter. The subsequent Energy Charter Treaty, and in particular Article 19 of the treaty, requires that each Contracting Party "... shall strive to minimise in an economically efficient manner, harmful Environmental Impacts arising from energy use."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encharter.org/fileadmin/user_upload/document/EN.pdf#page=64 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024073327/http://www.encharter.org/fileadmin/user_upload/document/EN.pdf |date=24 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on article 19 of the Energy Charter Treaty, the Protocol on Energy Efficiency and Related Environmental Aspects (PEEREA) defines in more detail the policy principles that can promote [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and provides guidance on the development of energy efficiency programmes. PEEREA was negotiated, opened for signature and entered into force at the same time (16 April 1998) as the Energy Charter Treaty.

In contrast to other activities in the Charter process, the emphasis in the work on energy efficiency is not [[Law of obligations|legally binding]], but rather on practical implementation of a political commitment to improve energy efficiency. This is promoted through policy discussions based on analysis and exchange of experience between the member countries, invited independent experts and other international organisations.

The implementation of PEEREA, provides its member countries with a range of best practices and a forum in which to share experiences and policy advice on [[Environmental impact of the energy industry|energy efficiency issues]]. Within this forum, particular attention is paid to national energy efficiency strategy, taxation, pricing policy in the energy sector, environmentally related subsidies and other mechanisms for [[Renewable energy commercialization|financing energy efficiency objectives]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encharter.org/fileadmin/user_upload/document/EN.pdf#page=141 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024073327/http://www.encharter.org/fileadmin/user_upload/document/EN.pdf |date=24 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy transit===
The Energy Charter Treaty provides a set of rules that covers the entire energy chain, including not only investments in production and generation but also the terms under which energy can be traded and transported across various national jurisdictions to international markets. As such, the agreement is intended to prevent disruption of fuel passing between countries.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew E. Kramer (1 January 2006), [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/01/international/europe/01cnd-russia.html/  Russia Cuts Flow of Natural Gas to Ukraine] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transit Protocol====
The Energy Charter Transit Protocol is a draft protocol which negotiations are not finalised yet. The Protocol would amplify and strengthen the treaty provisions on energy transit issues to mitigate some specific operational risks that continue to affect energy transit flows. Negotiations on the text of the Transit Protocol began in early 2000 and a compromise text reflecting an extended discussion between the European Union and Russia was tabled for adoption at the meeting of the Energy Charter Conference on 10 December 2003. It became clear during the meeting that a unanimous decision could not be reached on the basis of the compromise text; a complicating factor was that energy issues, including transit, were a subject on the bilateral agenda for the European Union and Russia in the context of Russian negotiations for accession to the World Trade Organization. The Protocol negotiations were then temporarily suspended.

In December 2007, the Energy Charter Conference reaffirmed its support for the finalisation of negotiations and adoption of the Energy Charter Protocol on Transit to expand the existing provisions of the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encharter.org/index.php?id=37 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210191510/http://www.encharter.org/index.php?id=37 |archivedate=10 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This work proceeded until October 2011, when the [[European Union]] argued that, given current developments in the international energy situation and the lack of progress in negotiations and consultations, it appeared no longer opportune to continue talks. A review of the issue at the end of 2015 noted the continued demand for a multilateral legally-binding framework for energy transit, and recommended further exploring the basis for negotiations of such an agreement, which could address various aspects of oil, gas and electricity transportation and transit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.energycharter.org/fileadmin/DocumentsMedia/CCDECS/2015/CCDEC201522.pdf|title = DECISION OF THE ENERGY CHARTER CONFERENCE|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Energy Charter Treaty includes an obligation of member countries to facilitate energy transit across their territory, in line with the principle of freedom of transit, and to secure established transit flows. At the same time, the treaty provisions do not oblige any country to introduce mandatory third-party access.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.energycharter.org/fileadmin/DocumentsMedia/Legal/ECT_Guide_en.pdf|title = THE ENERGY CHARTER TREATY: A READER’S GUIDE|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Principle of national sovereignty===
The principle of the Energy Charter are based on the idea that international flows of investments and technologies in the energy sector are mutually beneficial. But at the same time, national sovereignty over energy resources is a core principle of the treaty (ECT Article 18). An objective of the treaty is to promote transparency and efficiency in the operation of energy markets, but it is for governments to define the structure of their domestic energy sector. Each country is free to decide whether and how its national energy resources are developed, and the extent to which its energy sector is open to foreign investors. The treaty does not deal with the ownership issues of the energy companies–there is no obligation to privatise state-owned energy companies, or to break up vertically integrated energy companies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Membership==
Members include countries and Regional Economic Integration Organisations that have signed or acceded to the Trety. As 1 January 2018, the treaty has been signed or acceded to by fifty-four countries and Regional Economic Integration Organisations.&lt;ref&gt;https://energycharter.org/who-we-are/members-observers&lt;/ref&gt; All Members have ratified the treaty except for Australia, Belarus, Norway, and the Russian Federation. Belarus has accepted [[provisional application (treaty)|provisional application]] of the treaty,&lt;ref name="Belarus"/&gt;

===Observers===
Observers status is granted to countries and Regional Economic Integration Organisations that have signer either the European Energy Charter or the International Energy Charter. Observers have the right to attend all Charter meetings and to receive all related documentation, reports and analysis, and to participate in the working debates taking place within the Energy Charter. Also, International Organisations can be granted Observer status by decision of the Energy Charter Conference. The intention is that Observer status should provide the chance for a country to familiarise itself with the Charter and its functions, to facilitate its assessment of the benefits of accession to the Energy Charter Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petform.org.tr/images/yayinlar/ozel_raporlar/petform_energy_charter_treaty_memorandum.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126004021/http://www.petform.org.tr/images/yayinlar/ozel_raporlar/petform_energy_charter_treaty_memorandum.pdf |archivedate=26 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian participation===
{{See also|Russia in the European energy sector|Energy policy of Russia}}
The Russian Federation signed the treaty and applied it provisionally but did not ratify it. It linked the ratification of the treaty to negotiations on an Energy Charter Transit Protocol. In October 2006, German chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] and French president [[Jacques Chirac]] proposed the creation of a ''balanced energy partnership'' between France and Germany, representing the [[European Union]], and Russia. Under the agreement, Russia would have to sign the European Energy Charter, something President [[Vladimir Putin|Vladimir V. Putin]], has said impinges on Russia's national interests.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schwirtz (13 October 2006), [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E2D81130F930A25753C1A9609C8B63 Putin Must Eye Energy Plan of Germany and France] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, Russia indicated that the ratification of the treaty was unlikely due to the provisions requiring third-party access to Russia's pipelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/12/12/news/energy.php Russia gets tough on energy sales to Europe: No foreign access to pipelines, official says], by Judy Dempsey, [[International Herald Tribune]] 12 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 August 2009, it officially informed the depository of the treaty ([[Government of Portugal]]) that it did not intend to become a contracting party to the treaty and the related protocol terminating the provisional application of the treaty and the PEEREA starting from 18 October 2009.&lt;ref name=skadden&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom]] |title=Arbitration Panel Holds That the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty Protects Foreign Energy Sector Investments in Former Soviet Union |date=5 February 2010 | url= https://www.skadden.com/insights/arbitration-panel-holds-1994-energy-charter-treaty-protects-foreign-energy-sector-investmen |accessdate=8 May 2010 |deadurl= no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716080855/https://www.skadden.com/content/Publications/Publications1978_0.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding the termination of provisional application of the treaty by Russia, the provisions regarding dispute settlements and investment protection are still in force for additional twenty years. On 30 November 2009, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, which had been considering this case since 2005 under the UNCITRAL Rules, ruled that former [[Yukos]] shareholders can move on to the merits phase of their arbitration claim against the Russian government.&lt;ref name=skadden/&gt; GML, previously known as Menatep, the principle shareholder in Yukos, is suing Russia for more than $100 billion in an international arbitration case under the treaty. The hearings took place in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;James Marson (27 July 2012), [https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390443931404577551010116886418 Yukos Investors Win Over $2 Million in Damages from Russia] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014, the international arbitration panel in The Hague unanimously ruled in favour of the shareholders, awarding $50 billion damages for the seizure of assets and dismantling of Yukos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Russia Stole Yukos and Owes $50 Billion, International Panel Rules|url = https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/07/28/russia-stole-yukos-and-owes-50-billion-international-panel-rules/|website = Foreign Policy|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian government has vowed not to comply with the ruling, setting off an international legal dispute which has resulted in France and Belgium seizing Russian assets for possible use as restitution for the claimants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What’s Really Happening With the Yukos Case|url = https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/06/19/whats-really-happening-with-the-yukos-case-russia-putin-belgium-france/|website = Foreign Policy|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a French court ruled against the seizure by the French authorities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = French court rules in favor of Russia’s Roscosmos in Yukos assets seizure case|url = http://www.bilaterals.org/?french-court-rules-in-favor-of&amp;lang=en|website = Bilaterals.org|accessdate = 2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Dutch court later overturned the $50 billion ruling, arguing Russia had not ratified the Energy Charter Treaty and so was not bound by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dutch court overturns $50 billion ruling against Russia in Yukos case|url = http://www.bilaterals.org/?dutch-court-overturns-50-billion&amp;lang=en|website = Bilaterals.org|accessdate = 2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secretariat==
[[File:ECS-Building.jpg|thumb|The Secretariat is located in [[Brussels]].]]

The Energy Charter Treaty established the creation of a permanent Secretariat that was originally set up to accommodate the dialogue amongst the contracting parties during the negotiation of the treaty. The Secretariat is mandated by the Energy Charter Conference Primarily to provide the Conference with all necessary assistance for the performance of its duties including promotion, organisation and legal support along with meeting space for subsidiary body meetings hosted at the Secretariat.

Since 1 January 2012, the Secretary General is Dr [[Urban Rusnák]], and since January 2017, the Assistant Secretary General is Dr Masami Nakata.

===Organisation===
One of the primary [[Mandate (international law)|mandates]] given by the Energy Charter Conference to the Secretariat is to organise and administer meetings of the Conference and its subsidiary bodies. In addition, the Secretariat organises conferences and energy forums related to the global ongoing energy dialogues.

===Monitor ECT and PEEREA obligations===
Article 19 of the treaty, requires that each Contracting Party minimise, in an economically efficient manner, harmful environmental impacts arising from energy use.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ena.lt/pdfai/Treaty.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretariat monitors the enforcement of these obligations in the contracting parties of the treaty and creates various publicly available reports on each of the contracting parties such as [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] [http://www.encharter.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/BiH_EE_2012_ENG.pdf] and the investment [http://www.encharter.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/Poland_ICMS_2011_ENG.pdf] climate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encharter.org/index.php?id=20&amp;L=0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal support===
The Energy Charter Treaty contains a comprehensive system for settling disputes on matters covered by the treaty. The two primary forms of binding dispute settlement are [[International arbitration#Interstate Arbitration|state-state arbitration]] on the interpretation or application of almost all aspects of the treaty (except for competition and environmental issues), and [[International arbitration#International Investment Arbitration|investor-state arbitration]] (Article 26) for investment disputes. There are special provisions, based on the WTO model, for the resolution of inter-state trade issues and the treaty also offers a conciliation procedure for transit disputes. The Secretariat maintains legal advice to these arbitrations as well as has responsibility for maintaining the [[Travaux préparatoires]] used to clarify the intentions of the treaty by Article 32 of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]].

The Secretariat maintains a publicly available list of cases that have been brought by investors to international arbitration. These cases have been litigated under the arbitration regulations of the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|ICSID]], Arbitration Institute of the SCC, and [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law|UNCITRAL]]. The Arbitration Awards or Settlements are sometimes in the hundred of millions of dollars.&lt;ref name="dlapiper.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dlapiper.com/tribunal-in-yukos-case-holds-russia-is-bound-by-energy-charter-treaty/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021213707/http://www.dlapiper.com/tribunal-in-yukos-case-holds-russia-is-bound-by-energy-charter-treaty/ |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encharter.org/index.php?id=213&amp;L=0&lt;/ref&gt; Disputes concerning competition (Article 6) and environmental issues (Article 19) the Secretariat provides for bilateral (in the case of competition) or multilateral (in the case of environmental protection) non-binding consultation mechanisms.

{{European patent law}}
The '''European Patent Convention''' ('''EPC'''), also known as the '''Convention on the Grant of European Patents''' of 5 October 1973, is a multilateral [[treaty]] instituting the [[European Patent Organisation]] and providing an autonomous legal system according to which '''European patents''' are granted.  The term ''European patent'' is used to refer to patents granted under the European Patent Convention. However, a European patent is not a unitary right, but a group of essentially independent nationally-enforceable, nationally-revocable patents,&lt;ref name="SingerArt2andScourfield"&gt;The view that a European patent issues as independent national patents in each designated Contracting state is very convenient from a practical point of view. Some however consider this view as incorrect:
:"''The view that, after grant, a European patent breaks up into a bundle of national patents in designated Contracting States may appear plausible, but it is incorrect both in law and systematically''", Singer/Stauder, ''The European Patent Convention, A Commentary'', Munich, 2003, under Article 2.
Singer/Stauder's view seems in turn rather theoretical in view of decisions ''Roche Nederland BV v Primus'' and ''GAT v LUK'' of the [[European Court of Justice]] (see also "Enforcement and validity" section), which reinforced the independent character of a European patent in each Contracting State. As Tom Scourfield wrote in an article commenting on these two decisions:
:"''(...) a European patent is no more than a bundle of national patents pursuant to a single application. Until a true community patent becomes a reality it seems likely that true community enforcement will continue to elude patent owners.''" Tom Scourfield, ''Jurisdiction and Patents: ECJ rules on forum for validity and cross-border patent enforcement'', The CIPA Journal, August 2006, Volume 35 No. 8, p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt; subject to central revocation or narrowing as a group pursuant to two types of unified, post-grant procedures: a time-limited [[opposition procedure before the European Patent Office|opposition procedure]], which can be initiated by any person except the patent proprietor, and [[limitation and revocation procedures]], which can be initiated by the patent proprietor only.

The EPC provides a legal framework for the granting of European patents,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|2|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; via a single, harmonised procedure before the [[European Patent Office]]. A single [[patent application]], in one language,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|14}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be filed at the European Patent Office in [[Munich]],&lt;ref name="Art75-1-a"&gt;{{EPC Article|75|1|a}}&lt;/ref&gt; at its branch in [[The Hague]],&lt;ref name="Art75-1-a"/&gt;{{refn|The Hague branch of the EPO is actually located in [[Rijswijk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/g880007ep1.html Enlarged Board of Appeal decision G 7/88 (Administrative Agreement) of 16.11.1990], Summary of Facts and Submissions, V.(3)&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} at its sub-office in [[Berlin]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://archive.epo.org/epo/pubs/oj1989/p189_270.pdf Decision of the President of the European Patent Office dated 10 May 1989 on the setting up of a Filing Office in the Berlin sub-office of the European Patent Office]'', OJ 1989, 218&lt;/ref&gt; or at a national patent office of a Contracting State, if the national law of the State so permits.&lt;ref name="Art75-1-b"&gt;{{EPC Article|75|1|b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and rationale==
Before 1978, two important problems when seeking to obtain patent protection in Europe in a number of countries were first the need to file a separate patent application in each country, with a subsequent distinct grant procedure in each country, and secondly the need to translate the text of the application into a number of different languages. Different languages are indeed utilised across the European countries and there is substantial expense in preparing translations into each of those languages.  While the European Patent Convention does not totally overcome the need for translations (since a translation may be required after grant to validate a patent in a given EPC Contracting State), it does centralise the prosecution in one language and defers the cost of translations until the time of grant.

== History ==

In September 1949, French Senator [[Henri Longchambon]] proposed to the [[Council of Europe]] the creation of a European Patent Office. His proposal, known as the "Longchambon plan", marked the beginning of the work on a European patent law aimed at a "European patent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bossung |first=Otto |title=The Return of European Patent Law in the European Union |journal=IIC |volume=27 |issue=3/1996 |accessdate=30 June 2012 |url=http://www.suepo.org/public/background/bossung_en.htm |quote=Work on a European patent law aimed at a "European patent" had begun in Strasbourg in 1949 with the Longchambon plan. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304232011/http://www.suepo.org/public/background/bossung_en.htm |archivedate=4 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His plan was however not found to be practicable by the Council's Committee of Experts in patent matters. The meetings of the Committee nevertheless led to two Conventions, one on the [[European Convention relating to the Formalities required for Patent Applications|formalities required for patent applications]] (1953) and one on the [[European Convention on the International Classification of Patents for Invention|international classification of patent]] (1954).&lt;ref name="Tookey"&gt;G. W. Tookey, ''Patents in the European Field'' in Council of Europe, Council of Europe staff, ''European Yearbook 1969'', Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1971, pages 76–97, {{ISBN|90-247-1218-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Council's Committee then carried on its work on substantive patent law, resulting in the signature of the [[Strasbourg Patent Convention]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="Tookey"/&gt;

In 1973, the ''Munich Diplomatic Conference for the setting up of a European System for the Grant of Patents'' took place and the Convention was then signed in Munich (the Convention is sometimes known as the "Munich Convention"). The signature of the Convention was the accomplishment of a decade-long discussion during which [[Kurt Haertel]], considered by many as the father of the European Patent Organisation, and [[François Savignon]] played a decisive role.

The Convention entered into force on 7 October 1977 for the following first countries: [[Belgium]], Germany (then [[West Germany]]), France, [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]] and United Kingdom, and on 1 May 1978 for [[Sweden]]. However, the first patent applications were filed on 1 June 1978 (date fixed by the [[European Patent Organisation#Administrative Council|Administrative Council]] which held its first meeting on 19 October 1977).  Subsequently, other countries have joined the EPC.

The EPC is separate from the European Union (EU), and its membership is different; [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Turkey]], [[Monaco]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[San Marino]], [[Albania]] and [[Serbia]] are members of the EPO but are not members of the EU. The Convention is, as of January 2015, in force in 38 countries.&lt;ref name="members"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/about-us/epo/member-states.html|title=Member states of the European Patent Organisation|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serbia became the 38th state on 1 October 2010.&lt;ref name="serbia"/&gt;

A diplomatic conference was held in November 2000 in Munich to revise the Convention, amongst other things to integrate in the EPC new developments in [[international law]] and to add a level of judicial review of the [[Appeal procedure before the European Patent Office|Boards of Appeal]] decisions. The revised text, informally called the [[EPC 2000]], entered into force on 13 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[[Official Journal of the European Patent Office|Official Journal of the EPO]], 2/2006, [http://archive.epo.org/epo/pubs/oj006/02_06/02_1386.pdf ''Notice from the European Patent Office dated 27 January 2006 concerning deposit of the fifteenth instrument of ratification of the EPC Revision Act'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooperation agreements with non-contracting states: extension and validation agreements===
Throughout the history of the EPC, some non-contracting States have concluded cooperation agreements with the European Patent Organisation, known as extension or validation agreements. These states then became "extension states" or "validation states", which means that European patents granted by the EPO may be extended to those countries through the payment of additional fees and completion of certain formalities. Such cooperation agreements are concluded by the President of the European Patent Office on behalf of the European Patent Organisation pursuant to {{EPC Article|33|4}}, are not based on a "direct application of the EPC but solely on national law modelled on the EPC",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/natlaw/en/a/index.htm|title=National Law relating to EPC|publisher=EPO|quote=The extension system largely corresponds to the EPC system operating in the EPC contracting states, except that it is based not on direct application of the EPC but solely on national law modelled on the EPC. It is therefore subject to the national extension rules of the country concerned.|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and exist to assist with the establishment of national property rights in these states.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Case law book|vii|2|1}}: "Extension agreements and ordinances", "Legal nature"&lt;/ref&gt; As is the case in EPO contracting states, the rights conferred to European patents validated/extended to these states are the same as national patents in those states. However, the extension of a European patent or patent application to these states is "not subject to the jurisdiction of the [EPO] boards of appeal."&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Case law book|vii|2|2}}: "No jurisdiction of the boards of appeal"&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2015, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Montenegro]]&lt;ref name="ME"/&gt; have extension agreements with the EPO so that, in effect, these states can be designated in a European patent application. Several other "extension states" have since become states parties to the EPC. Furthermore, so-called "validation agreements" with Morocco, Moldova, Tunisia, and Cambodia are also in effect since 1 March 2015, 1 November 2015, 1 December 2017, and 1 March 2018, respectively.&lt;ref name=MA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/news-issues/news/2015/20150119.html|title=Morocco recognises European patents as national patents|accessdate=25 January 2015|date=19 January 2015|work=European Patent Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/news-issues/news/2015/20150302.html|title=Validation agreement with Morocco enters into force|date=1 March 2015|publisher=EPO|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moldova-2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epo.org/news-issues/news/2015/20151008.html|title=European patents to cover Moldova|date=8 October 2015|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tunisia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/news-issues/news/2017/20171004.html|title=Brevets européens en Tunisie : L’accord de validation entre l’OEB et la Tunisie entrera en vigueur le 1er décembre|trans-title=European patents in Tunisia: The validation agreement between the EPO and Tunisia will enter into force on December 1|date=3 October 2017|publisher=European Patent Office|language=French|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.epo.org/about-us/foundation/validation-states.html|title=Validation states|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="validation-agreement-KH"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/official-journal/information-epo/archive/20180209.html|title=Validation of European patents in Cambodia (KH) with effect from 1 March 2018|date=9 February 2018|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal nature and content ==
{{EPC requirements}}
The European Patent Convention is "a special agreement within the meaning of Article 19 of the [[Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]], signed in Paris on 20 March 1883 and last revised on 14 July 1967, and a regional patent treaty within the meaning of Article 45, paragraph 1, of the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] of 19 June 1970."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2013/e/apre.html|title=Preamble [of the European Patent Convention]|publisher=EPO|accessdate=25 January 2015}} See also [http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/pdf/g980002ep1.pdf Enlarged Board of Appeal opinion G2/98], "Reasons for the Opinion", point 3, first sentence: "The EPC constitutes, according to its preamble, a special agreement within the meaning of Article 19 of the Paris Convention".&lt;/ref&gt; The European Patent Convention currently does not lead to the grant of centrally enforceable patents in all 38 countries, although the [[European Union patent]] would allow for unitary effect: centrally enforceability throughout 24 of the 27 countries of the European Union.

The content of the Convention includes several texts in addition to the main 178 articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2013/e/ma1.html|title=The European Patent Convention|publisher=EPO|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These additional texts, which are integral parts of the Convention,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|164|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; are:
* the "Implementing Regulations to the Convention on the Grant of European patents", commonly known as the "Implementing Regulations". The function of the Implementing Regulations is "to determine in more detail how the Articles should be applied".&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Case law book|iii|h|6}}: "Implementing Regulations"&lt;/ref&gt; In case of conflict between the provisions of the EPC and those of the Implementing Regulations, the provisions of the EPC prevail.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|164|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the "Protocol on Jurisdiction and the recognition of decisions in respect of the right to the grant of a European patent", commonly known as the "Protocol on Recognition". This protocol deals with the right to the grant of a European patent but exclusively applies to European patent applications.
* the "Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of the European Patent Organisation", commonly known as the "Protocol on Privileges and Immunities";
* the "Protocol on the Centralisation of the European Patent System and on its Introduction", commonly known as the "Protocol on Centralisation";
* the "Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 of the Convention";
* the "Protocol on the Staff Complement of the European Patent Office at The Hague", commonly known as the "Protocol on Staff Complement".

== Substantive patent law ==
One of the most important articles of the Convention, {{EPC Article|52|1}}, entitled  "''Patentable [[invention]]s''", states:
{{quotation|European patents shall be granted for any inventions, in all fields of technology, providing that they are [[Novelty under the European Patent Convention|new]], involve an [[inventive step under the European Patent Convention|inventive step]], and are susceptible of [[industrial applicability|industrial application]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{EPC Article|52|1}}. The state of the art is further defined in Articles 54(2)-(5), and a limited grace period is specified in {{EPC Article|55}}, but this is only relevant in cases of breach of confidence or disclosure of the invention in a recognised international exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This article constitutes the "fundamental provision of the EPC which governs the patentability of inventions".&lt;ref name="T 154/04-r6"&gt; [http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/t040154ex1.htm Decision T 154/04] of 15 November 2006, Reasons 6, to be published at the [[Official Journal of the European Patent Office]].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the EPC provides further indications on what is patentable. There are exclusions under Article 52(2) and (3) EPC and exclusions under Article 53 EPC.

First, [[discovery (observation)|discoveries]], [[theory|scientific theories]], mathematical methods,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2|a}}&lt;/ref&gt; aesthetic creations,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2|b}}&lt;/ref&gt; schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business, programs for computers&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2|c}}&lt;/ref&gt; and presentations of information&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2|d}}&lt;/ref&gt; are not regarded as inventions&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are excluded from patentability only to the extent that the invention relates to those areas ''as such''.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is "a negative, non-exhaustive list of what should not be regarded as an invention within the meaning of Article 52(1) EPC."&lt;ref name="T 154/04-r6"/&gt; ''(For further information, see also: [[Software patents under the European Patent Convention|Software patents under the EPC]]).''

The second set of exclusions, or exceptions, include
* inventions contrary to "''ordre public''" or morality,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|53|a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* plant or animal varieties and essentially biological processes for the production of plants and animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|53|b}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* methods for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy, and [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] methods practised on the human or animal body,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|53|c}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have been excluded for "socio-ethical considerations and considerations of [[public health]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.epo.org/projects/babylon/eponet.nsf/0/cdd5fb0c3153e9c3c12576cb00563d2d/$FILE/G1_07_en.pdf Decision G 1/07 of February 15, 2010], Reasons 3.3.6. See also [[G 1/07]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unified prosecution phase ==
{{main|Grant procedure before the European Patent Office}}

The Convention also includes provisions setting out filing requirements of European applications, the procedure up to grant, the opposition procedure and other aspects relating to the prosecution of patent applications under the Convention.

European patent applications may be filed in any language, but they are prosecuted only in one of the three official languages of the EPO – English, French and German. If an application is filed in a language other than an official language, a translation must be filed into one of the three official languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|14|2}}; {{EPO Guidelines|a|vii|1|1}}: "Admissible languages; time limit for filing the translation of the application"; "European patent applications can be filed in any language."&lt;/ref&gt; within two months from the date of filing.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Rule|6|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official language of filing (or of the translation) is adopted as the "language of proceedings" and is used by the EPO for communications.

European patent applications are [[patent prosecution|prosecuted]] in a similar fashion to most patent systems – the invention is searched and published, and subsequently examined for compliance with the requirements of the EPC.

During the prosecution phase, a European patent is a single regional proceeding, and "the grant of a European patent may be requested for one or more of the Contracting States."&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An applicant for a European patent designates those Contracting States in which protection for the [[invention]] is desired,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|79}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Update after|2010|11}} &lt;!-- To be converted to EPC 2000 --&gt; and the designations need to be "confirmed" later during the procedure through the payment of designation fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|79|2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once granted by the EPO,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; a European patent comes into existence effectively as a group of national patents in each of the designated Contracting States.

==Opposition==
{{main|Opposition procedure before the European Patent Office}}

There are only two types of centrally executed procedures after grant, the opposition procedure and the [[limitation and revocation procedures before the European Patent Office|limitation and revocation procedures]]. The opposition procedure, governed by the EPC, allows third parties to file an opposition against a European patent within 9 months of the date of grant of that patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|99}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]] process, subject to appeal, which can lead to maintenance, maintenance in amended form or revocation of a European patent. Simultaneously to the opposition, a European patent may be the subject of litigation at a national level (for example an infringement dispute).  National courts may suspend such infringement proceedings pending outcome of the opposition proceedings to avoid proceedings running in parallel and the uncertainties that may arise from that.

== Grant, effect and need for translations ==

In contrast to the unified, regional character of a European patent application, the granted European patent does not comprise, in effect, any such unitary character, except for the opposition procedure.&lt;ref&gt;In addition to the opposition procedure and even after it has ended, particular acts can still be performed before the European Patent Office, such as requesting a rectification of an incorrect designation of inventor under {{EPC Rule|19|1}}. {{Update after|2010|11}} &lt;!-- To be converted to EPC 2000 --&gt; "Rectification may [indeed] be requested after the proceedings before the EPO are terminated" (Guid. A III 5.6).&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, one European patent in one Contracting State&lt;ref&gt;There is no consistent usage of a particular expression to refer to "the European patent in a particular designated Contracting State for which it is granted". The article uses the expression "a European patent in a Contracting State" which is considered to be the most consistent with the authoritative text, i.e. the EPC.&lt;/ref&gt; is effectively independent of the same European patent in each other Contracting State, except for the opposition procedure.

A European patent confers rights on its proprietor, in each Contracting State in respect of which it is granted, from the date of publication of the mention of its grant in the [[European Patent Bulletin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|64|1}}: EP patent has same effect as national patent in "each Contracting State in respect of which it is granted"; {{EPC Article|97|2) and (4}}: decision to grant "for the designated Contracting States" is made by the examining division.&lt;/ref&gt; That is also the date of publication of the B1 document, i.e. the European patent specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|98}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the European patent is granted and confers rights in all its designated Contracting States at the date of mention of the grant, whether or not a prescribed translation is filed with a national patent office later on (though the right may later be deemed never to have existed in any particular State if a translation is not subsequently filed in time, as described below).

A translation of a granted European patent must be filed in some EPC Contracting States to avoid loss of right. Namely, in the Contracting States which have "prescribe[d] that if the text, in which the European Patent Office intends to grant a European patent (...) is not drawn up in one of its official languages, the applicant for or proprietor of the patent shall supply to its central industrial property office a translation of this text in one of its official languages at his option or, where that State has prescribed the use of one specific official language, in that language".&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|65|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European patent is ''[[void ab initio]]'' in a designated Contracting State where the required translation (if required) is not filed within the prescribed time limit after grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|65|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other Contracting States, no translation needs to be filed, for example in Ireland if the European patent is in English. In those Contracting States where the [[London Agreement (2000)|London Agreement]] is in force the requirement to file a translation of the European patent has been entirely or partially waived.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Veronese|Watchorn|2011|}}, Chapter XI.4&lt;/ref&gt; If a translation is required, a fee covering the publication of said translation may be due as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|65|2}}; [http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/national/html/en/iv/index.htm National law, Chapter IV, Filing of translations of the patent specification under Article 65 EPC] (regarding implementation in EPC Contracting States)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enforcement and validity ==
{{main|Enforcement of European patents}}
Almost all attributes of a European patent in a Contracting State, i.e. ownership, validity, and infringement, are determined independently under respective national law, except for the opposition procedure, limitation procedure, and revocation procedure as discussed above. Though the EPC imposes some common limits, the EPC expressly adopts national law for interpretation of all substantive attributes of a European patent in a Contracting State, with a few exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{EPC Article|2|2}}, {{EPC Article|64|1) and(3}}, {{EPC Article|66}}, {{EPC Article|74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, almost all post-grant proceedings – including [[renewal (patent)|renewal]], revocation proceedings (when initiated by somebody else than the proprietor), and [[patent infringement|infringement enforcement]] are determined under national law.

EPO Boards of Appeal decisions are not precedential at all upon national courts, which have exclusive jurisdiction on validity and infringement after a European patent has been granted (except during the 9-month opposition period, which can only relate to validity). However, national courts will tend to take note, and may find 'persuasive', decisions of the EPO Boards, though they can disagree with them.

===Infringement===
[[patent infringement|Infringement]] is remitted almost entirely to national law and to national courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|64|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of its very few substantive interventions into national law, the EPC requires that national courts must consider the "direct product of a patented process" to be an infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|64|2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "extent of the protection" conferred by a European patent is determined primarily by reference to the claims of the European patent (rather than by the disclosure of the specification and [[patent drawing|drawing]]s, as in some older patent systems), though the description and drawings are to be used as interpretive aids in determining the meaning of the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|69|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 EPC" provides further guidance, that claims are to be construed using a "fair" middle position, neither "strict, literal" nor as mere guidelines to considering the description and drawings, though of course even the protocol is subject to national interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''Southco Inc v Dzus'', [1992] R.P.C. 299 CA; ''Improver Corp. v Remington Products Inc'' [1990] FSR 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The authentic text of a European patent application and of a European patent are the documents in the language of the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SingerArt2Precedence"&gt;{{harvnb|Singer|Stauder|2003}}, under Article 2, section "EPC provisions on European patents that take precedence over national law"&lt;/ref&gt;

All other substantive rights attached to a European patent in a Contracting State, such as what acts constitute infringement (indirect and divided infringement, infringement by equivalents, extraterritorial infringement, infringement outside the term of the patent with economic effect during the term of the patent, infringement of product claims by processes for making or using, exports, assembly of parts into an infringing whole, etc.), the effect of prosecution history on interpretation of the claims, remedies for infringement or bad faith enforcement (injunction, damages, attorney fees, other civil penalties for wilful infringement, etc.), equitable defences, coexistence of an EP national daughter and a national patent for identical subject matter, ownership and assignment, extensions to patent term for regulatory approval, etc., are expressly remitted to national law.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|2|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a period in the late-1990s, national courts issued cross-border injunctions covering all EP jurisdictions, but this has been limited by the [[European Court of Justice]].  In two cases in July 2006 interpreting Articles 6.1 and 16.4 of the [[Brussels Regime|Brussels Convention]], the European Court of Justice held that European patents are national rights that must be enforced nationally, that it was "unavoidable" that infringements of the same European patent have to be litigated in each relevant national court, even if the lawsuit is against the same group of companies, and that cross-border injunctions are not available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=Rechercher$docrequire=alldocs&amp;numaff=C-4/03&amp;datefs=&amp;datefe=&amp;nomusuel=&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100 Case C-4/03, ''Gesellschaft für Antriebstechnik  v Lamellen und Kupplungsbau Beteiligungs KG'', (European Ct. of Justice 13 July 2006)]; [http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=Rechercher$docrequire=alldocs&amp;numaff=C-539/03&amp;datefs=&amp;datefe=&amp;nomusuel=&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100 Case C-539/03, ''Roche Nederland BV v Primus'', (European Ct. of Justice 13 July 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Validity===
Validity is also remitted largely to national law and national courts. {{EPC Article|138|1}} limits the application of national law to only the following grounds of invalidity, and specifies that the standards for each ground are those of national law:

* if the subject-matter of the European patent is not patentable within the terms of Articles 52 to 57 EPC (see "Substantive patent law" section above);
* if the [[disclosure of the invention under the European Patent Convention|disclosure does not permit the invention to be carried out by a person skilled in the art]];&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|138|1|b}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* if [[amendments under the European Patent Convention|amendments have been made]] such that the subject-matter extends beyond the content of the application as filed;&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|138|1|c}}, {{EPC Article|123|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* if the claims have been broadened post-grant, e.g. in opposition proceedings;&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|138|1|d}}, {{EPC Article|123|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* an improper proprietor&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|138|1|e}}, {{EPC Article|60}}&lt;/ref&gt;—in some jurisdictions, only the person pretending to be entitled to the European patent can raise this specific ground, so that the resulting nullity of the patent may be relative to some persons only&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Laurent Teyssedre, [http://europeanpatentcaselaw.blogspot.com/2012/03/la-nullite-tiree-du-motif-de-lart-1381.html ''La nullité tirée du motif de l'Art 138(1) e) est relative''], Le blog du droit européen des brevets, 5 March 2012. Consulted on 10 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;—.

A national court may partially invalidate a European patent in a Contracting State, e.g., by revoking only some claims, or by permitting amendment to the claims, the description or the drawings, as allowed by national law.

A European patent is also non-unitary in that it may be revoked in one Contracting State while maintained in another. However, a national court in one Contracting State may not revoke a European patent in another Contracting State.

== Term (duration) of a European patent ==

The EPC requires all jurisdictions to give a European patent a [[Term of patent|term]] of 20 years from the filing date,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|63|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the filing date being the actual date of filing an application for a European patent or the date of filing of an international application under the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty|PCT]] designating the EPO. The filing date is not necessarily the [[priority right|priority date]], which can be up to one year earlier.  The term of a granted European patent may be extended under national law if national law provides term extension to compensate for pre-marketing regulatory approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|63|2|b}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[European Economic Area|EEA]] member states this is by means of a [[supplementary protection certificate]].

== Relation with the Patent Cooperation Treaty ==

A European patent application may result from the filing of an international application under the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] (PCT), i.e. the filing of a PCT application, and then the entry into "European regional phase",&lt;ref&gt;See {{PCT Article|11|3}}, which provides a [[legal fiction]] according to which an international application, i.e. a PCT application, has the effect of a regular European patent application as of the international filing date under certain conditions (see for instance [http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/j090018ex1.html Decision J 18/09 of the Legal Board of Appeal 3.1.01 of 1 September 2010], Reasons 7 and 8); and {{EPC Article|150|2), (first sentence}}: "International applications filed under the PCT may be the subject of proceedings before the European Patent Office."&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the transition from the international to the European procedural stages. The European patent application is therefore said to be a "Euro-PCT application" and the EPO is said to act as a designated or elected Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Guidelines|e|viii|2}}: "EPO as designated or elected Office".&lt;/ref&gt; In case of conflict between the provisions of the EPC and those of the PCT, the provisions of the PCT and its Regulations prevail over those of the EPC.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|150|2), (third sentence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve EPC Contracting States, namely [[Belgium]], [[Cyprus]], France, [[Greece]], Ireland, Italy, [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Malta]], [[Monaco]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Slovenia]] have "closed their national route".&lt;ref&gt;For Malta, source: "European Patent Office web site, [http://www.epo.org/patents/law/legal-texts/InformationEPO/archiveinfo/02012007.html ''Accession to the PCT by Malta (MT)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926220506/http://www.epo.org/patents/law/legal-texts/InformationEPO/archiveinfo/02012007.html |date=26 September 2007 }}, Information from the European Patent Office, January 2, 2007; for Latvia, source: [http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2007/pct_news_2007_4.pdf ''Latvia: Closing of the National Route via the PCT''], [[PCT Newsletter]] of April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that it is no longer possible to obtain a national patent protection through the international (PCT) phase without entering into the regional European phase and obtaining a European patent. Lithuania closed its "national route" most recently, on 4 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2012/pct_news_2012_02.pdf ''Lithuania: Closing of the National Route via the PCT''], [[PCT Newsletter]] No. 02/2012, p. 1.; {{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2014/pct_news_2014_05.pdf|title=Lithuania: Reminder re the Closing of the National Route via the PCT|work=PCT Newsletter No. 05/2014|publisher=WIPO|page=3|accessdate=11 May 2014}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/newslett/2014/article_0005.html|title=Lithuania: Reminder re the Closing of the National Route via the PCT|date=July–August 2014|work=PCT Newsletter No. 07-08/2014|accessdate=13 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714142535/http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/newslett/2014/article_0005.html|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia''' ('''FAS''') ({{lang-ru|Федеральная антимонопольная служба России, ФАС России}}) is the federal-level [[executive (government)|executive]] governmental organ that controls the execution of the [[Russian competition law|antitrust law]] and related areas. It is headed by [[Igor Artemyev|Igor Artemiev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.fas.gov.ru/|title=FAS Russia|first=Федеральная Антимонопольная Служба - ФАС|last=России|website=en.fas.gov.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was established by the Decree of [[President of Russia]] #314 by March 9, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fas.gov.ru/about/overview/obshhee.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, on a proposal of the Prime-Minister of Russia [[Dmitry Medvedev]] President Vladimir Putin approved the merger of the Federal Tariffs Service with the FAS Russia, adding thus to the competences of the latter mandate with price and tariff regulation, regulation of electricity tariffs, gas prices and certain other tariffs and some functions of natural monopoly regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/putin-approves-plan-to-merge-anti-monopoly-watchdog-with-rival-agency/525718.html|title=Putin Approves Plan to Merge Anti-Monopoly Watchdog With Rival Agency|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
Among the departments of the FAS Central authority there are:
* Department for Control over Construction and Natural Resources
* Department for Industry Control
* Department for Regulation over Electric Power Industry
* Department for Regulation of [[Telecommunication]]s and Information Technologies
* Department for Control over Financial Markets
* Department for Control over Advertising and Unfair Competition

== International Cooperation ==
The FAS Russia cooperates with international organizations and foreign authorities in the sphere of the antimonopoly policy, combating unfair competition practices and governmental regulation of natural monopolies.

The international activity of the FAS Russia includes:

- Contribution to integration of the Russian economy into the [[Global economy|global economic area]];

- Realization of economic liabilities of the Russian Federation on issues, related to the competence of the FAS Russia;

- Participation in development of conception of united [[European economic space]];

- Protection of Russian interests by participation in field-oriented [[international organization]]s;

- Implementation of the best foreign experience to the Russian practice, advanced training of employees of the FAS Russia;

- Preparation and realization of technical assistance from international organizations on behalf of the FAS Russia

The FAS Russia participates in International Working Groups. On its initiative 3 groups were created:

- Working Group on Investigatory Issues of Pricing in Oil and Oil Product Markets and Methods of Their Functioning (the Working Group on oil) – was created in cooperation with the [[Wettbewerbsgesetz|Austrian Federal Competition Authority]] in 2011 and closed down in 2014 since all its goals were achieved;

- International Working Group on Research of Competition Issues in the Market of International Telecommunications (Roaming) – was created in 2012 for the purpose of meeting the Recommendations for [[Developing country|Developing Markets]] of International Telecommunications in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] Member-States contained in the Report on the State of Competition in the CIS Mobile Communication Markets;

- International Working Group for Studying Competition Problems on [[Pharmaceutics|Pharmaceutical Sector]] – was created in cooperation with the [[Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato|Italian Competition Authority]] in 2012; aimed at elaboration of specific proposals on forming the competition environment in the pharmaceutical market and ensuring the availability of medicines to the consumers.

The FAS Russia has established ties and participates in the work of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)]], Interstate Council for Antimonopoly Policy (ICAP) uniting 10 CIS Countries and [[Ukraine]], [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)]], [[Eurasian Economic Union|Eurasian Economic Union (EEU)]], [[International Competition Network|International Competition Network (ICN)]], [[BRICS]], [[European Union]] (basing on the Agreement on partnership and cooperation between Russia and the EU entered into force in 1997), [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)]], [[Energy Regulators Regional Association|Energy Regulators Regional Association (ERRA)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unctad.org/meetings/en/Contribution/CCPB_IGE2014_RTInfCoop_Russia_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

To enhance international cooperation in the competition field, the FAS Russia holds annually the event [[“Russian Competition Week”]] which in 2015 gathered heads of competition authorities of the countries all across the globe and was attended by Vladimir Putin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/50352|title=Federal Anti-Monopoly Service Competition Week in Russia forum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prominent cases ==
'''a)     Google'''

On September 14, 2015 the FAS Russia's Commission arrived to the conclusion on abuse by the [[Google]] group of companies of its dominant position on the market of pre-installed application stores, based on investigating the case against Google Inc, Google Ireland Ltd., Google Ltd., following the Russian Internet company [[Yandex]]' complain that Google’s search engine was compulsorily installed as the default on mobile devices and that its icons enjoyed preferential placement on the screen. To restore competition on the market, Google, in accord with the FAS Russia's determination, must adjust its contracts with mobile devices vendors within a month – exclude anticompetitive requirements from the contracts that restrict installing applications and services of other vendors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/news/317732-google-monopoly-fas-russia/|title=|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
Among U.S.&amp;nbsp;government information, FOUO is primarily used by the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Department of Defense]] as a handling instruction for [[Controlled Unclassified Information]] (CUI) which may be exempt from release under exemptions two through nine of the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA).&lt;ref name="USDoD_Issuances"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pub1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822052147/http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pub1.html |archivedate=2008-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the various sub-categorizations for strictly unclassified information which, on 24 February 2012, was officially consolidated as CUI. Other departments using this designation include the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/foia/mgmt_directive_110421_safeguarding_sensitive_but_unclassified_information.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Department of Defense===
On 24 February 2012, the [[Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence]] published the publicly available [http://www.esd.whs.mil/Directives/issuances/dodm/ DoDM 5200.01], a four-volume manual consolidating all marking of information used by the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Department of Defense.&lt;ref name="dodm5200.01-v1"&gt;[http://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodm/520001_vol1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a lot more information on the marking, access, and protection of "For Official Use Only" information. Most of the information is in the [http://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodm/520001_vol4.pdf fourth volume], but the [http://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodm/520001_vol2.pdf second volume] also contains guidelines on FOUO information.

==Australia==
For Official Use Only (FOUO) is one of five categories of the Dissemination Limiting Marker (DLM) defined by the Australian Government Information Security Management Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/rwpattach.nsf/VAP/%28689F2CCBD6DC263C912FB74B15BE8285%29~Australian+Government+information+security+management+guidelines-+Australian+Government+Security+classification+system.pdf/$file/Australian+Government+information+security+management+guidelines-+Australian+Government+Security+classification+system.pdf Australian Government Information Security Management Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt; The guidelines state that FOUO should only be used on unclassified information, when its compromise may cause limited damage to national security, Australian Government agencies, commercial entities or members of the public. However unlike the United States usage, the presence or absence of an FOUO marker expressly does not provide any information about the document's status under the [[Freedom of Information Act 1982|Freedom of Information Act]].

The '''forms of action''' were the different procedures by which a [[legal claim]] could be made during much of the history of the [[English common law]]. Depending on the court, a [[plaintiff]] would purchase a [[writ]] in [[Chancery (medieval office)|Chancery]] (or file a bill) which would set in motion a series of events eventually leading to a trial in one of the medieval common law courts. Each writ entailed a different set of procedures and remedies which together amounted to the "form of action".

The forms of action were abolished during the 19th century, but they have left an indelible mark on the law. In the early [[Middle Ages]], the focus was on the procedure that was employed to bring one's claim to the royal courts of [[Court of King's Bench (England)|King's Bench]] or [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Common Pleas]]: it was the ''form'' of one's action, not its substance, which occupied legal discussion. This restrictive approach is one of the reasons which attracted litigants to petition the King directly, which eventually led to the development of a separate court known as the Court of Chancery, from which the body of law known as [[Equity (law)|equity]] derives. Modern [[English law]], as in most other legal systems, now looks to substance rather than to form: a claimant need only demonstrate that he or she has a valid [[cause of action]].

==Forms of action==

The substantive law lay buried beneath the various actions: medieval practitioners and judges thought procedurally, not substantively.&lt;ref&gt;See generally [[John Baker (legal historian)|Sir John Baker]], ''An Introduction to English Legal History'' (4th ed); [[S. F. C. Milsom]], ''Historical Foundations of the Common'' Law (2nd ed).&lt;/ref&gt; Rights and duties which we would consider to be part of the law of [[English property law|property]], [[English tort law|tort]], [[English contract law|contract]] or [[English unjust enrichment law|unjust enrichment]] were not conceptualised as such.

In the early medieval period, justice was administered at a local level. Following the [[Norman conquest of England]] in the 11th century, a system of royal central justice gradually took shape. The principal royal courts were King's Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer. These royal courts were initially only interested in matters relating to the feudal system: that is, to land law. Accordingly, many of the earliest writs dealt with real property. For example:

* Writ of right
* [[assize of novel disseisin]]
* [[assize of mort d'ancestor]]
* Writ of entry sur [[disseisin]] in the per and cui
* Writ of besaiel
* Writ of [[quare impedit]]
* [[Ejectment]]
Over time, the royal courts began to take notice of other cases. These early writs were in the ''praecipe'' form: they commanded that the defendant perform a certain act or else appear and explain why he had not done so. Examples include the writs of covenant, debt and account. Such writs ''demanded something as of right''.&lt;ref&gt;See [[John Baker (legal historian)|Sir John Baker]], ''An Introduction to English Legal History'' (4th ed)&lt;/ref&gt; The royal courts were initially only concerned with ''complaints of wrong'' if the wrong involved a forcible breach of the King's Peace. Such wrongs were enforced by a writ of trespass ''vi et armis contra pacem regis''. During the 14th century the royal courts gradually allowed actions which did not involve breaches of the King's Peace. Instead, the plaintiff would set out his 'special case' in an extra clause, specifying the damage sustained which justified the bringing of an action. This was known as a trespass on the case. From the trespass on the case developed many other forms of action. Apart from the actions which dealt with real property, other significant forms of action include:
* Action of covenant
* Action of debt ''sur obligation'' ("Debt on an obligation")
* Action of debt ''sur contract'' ("Debt on a contract")
* Action of [[detinue]]
* Action of account
* Trespass ''vi et armis contra pacem regis'' ("Trespass with force and arms against the King's peace")
* Trespass ''sur la case'' ("Trespass on the case" or "action on the case")
** Conversion
** Nuisance
** Negligence
** Deceit
** Action on the case for words (Defamation, Slander) 
** [[Assumpsit]]
*** Special assumpsit
*** Indebitatus assumpsit 
**** [[Money had and received|Action for money had and received to the plaintiff's use]]
**** Action for money paid to the defendant's use
**** [[Quantum meruit]]
**** Quantum valebant 
Many actions developed from the action on the case during the later history of the common law. The three most significant of these were:&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Sir John Baker, ''An Introduction to Legal History'' (4th ed); David Ibbetson, ''Historical Introduction to the Law of Obligations'' (2nd ed).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''The action of assumpsit'', the rapid expansion of which is traced to ''[[Slade's Case]]'' (1602). The medieval law of contract developed in a fractured way through the old actions of covenant, debt and account. In the 1500s litigants began to use the action on the case to enforce contractual agreements (with the exception of contracts under seal, for which debt ''sur obligation'' was required), a shift vindicated in ''Slade's Case''. The modern [[English contract law|law of contract]] then gradually began to take shape.
* ''The action of indebitatus assumpsit''. Following the recognition in ''Slade's Case'' (1602) that assumpsit could be brought in lieu of debt ''sur contract'', a form of action known as indebitatus assumpsit took shape. This action developed several sub-forms known as the common money counts. These actions were initially used to enforce what we would call contractual liability, but they rested on the court implying that a defendant had promised to pay a sum of money to the plaintiff. This promise initially reflected reality, but came to be used fictitiously. Thus where A mistakenly paid money to B, the law would imply a promise by B that B would repay the money: A could then bring an action for money had and received and recover the mistaken payment. The defendant's obligation was not consensually undertaken, but imposed by law. From such actions came the [[Quasi-contract|law of quasi-contract]].  This area of law is now known as the [[English unjust enrichment law|law of unjust enrichment]]. 
* ''The action on the case for negligence'', the rapid expansion of which is traced to [[Donoghue v Stevenson]] [1932]. The tort of negligence lies at the heart of the modern [[English tort law|law of tort]], which also includes obligations enforced via the old actions of trespass (to the person, to goods, and to land), actions on the case, conversion, deceit, and defamation.

==England==
One of the reasons for the crystallisation of particular forms of action in English common law is the fact that actions in the royal courts were commenced by use of a writ purchased in Chancery. Initially, the clerks of the Chancery were permitted to devise new writs to deal with new situations. This freedom was drastically curtailed by the [[Provisions of Oxford]].

By the 14th century the common law had begun to show some of its defects. First, different forms of action would result in different procedures, hence one's chance of success could depend critically on the form of action which was used. The forms were mandatory: if the wrong form were used, a case could fail. Secondly, the common law had strict rules of evidence. For example, a deed was conclusive proof of a defendant's liability to pay. If a plaintiff brought a writ of debt ''sur obligation'' against the defendant, but the defendant had already paid the debt, the defendant would still be held liable to pay unless he could produce a deed of acquittance. Problems such as these prompted litigants to turn to the [[Equity (law)|Court of Chancery]], which had begun to develop judicial functions in the early 14th century.

===Abolition of the forms===

Because the forms of action remained largely static from the 13th century, English lawyers and judges formulated a number of [[legal fiction]]s in order to fit new types of cases within the existing forms.

For example, in a writ of debt ''sur contract'', the defendant could generally elect between having a jury trial or [[wager of law]]. The latter was a particularly undesired option for a plaintiff because the defendant could ''hire'' oath-helpers. This and other restrictions (for example, that the sum the plaintiff sued for had to be a fixed rather than an [[Liquidated damages|unliquidated]] sum) made debt ''sur contract'' undesirable for enforcing oral contracts. In the 16th century, litigants began to bring an action on the case instead: an action of assumpsit. The plaintiff would allege that, because the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff, the defendant had undertook (''assumpsit'') to pay the money. The Court of King's Bench gradually accepted that the subsequent promise did not need not be proven: the defendant's alleged promise to pay the antecedent debt would be supplied by law. This view was vindicated in ''[[Slade's Case]]'' (1602).

The forms themselves remained unchallenged. The Court of Chancery eventually ceased to be the answer to the restrictive approach at common law. By the 16th century the intervention of the Chancellor was increasingly said to depend on principles, rather than on some unbounded discretion. Chancery developed a stronger system of precedent and, in the words of [[John Baker (legal historian)|Professor Sir John Baker]], "hardened into law".&lt;ref&gt;See [[John Baker (legal historian)|Sir John Baker]], ''An Introduction to English Legal History'' (4th ed)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] passed several laws to simplify legal procedure, and the old forms of action were gradually swept away:
* For personal forms of action, the ''Uniformity of Process Act 1832'' (2 Will. IV, c.39) imposed a single uniform process. The older forms of writ were abolished and a new form of writ was to be used, although the writ had to state the form of action that was being used.
* The next year, most real and mixed actions were abolished, by the ''Real Property Limitation Act 1833'' (3 and 4 Will. IV, c. 27, sec 36).
* There then followed the ''Common Law Procedure Act 1852'' (15 and 16 Vic., c. 76), which dropped the requirement that any particular form of action should be mentioned within a writ. 
* Finally, with the passage of the [[Judicature Act 1873]], the last vestiges of the forms of action were removed. The flexible bill procedure of Chancery was adopted by the common law courts. It was now only necessary to state the facts sufficient to give rise to one's [[cause of action]].

=== The substantive law ===
With the abolition of the forms of action, it became necessary (and for the first time truly possible) to perceive the substantive law beneath the various actions. In terms of the private law of obligations, the following points can be noted.
* ''Contract.'' The various writs by which agreements could be enforced became part of a modern [[English contract law|law of contract]], explicable in terms of consensually assumed obligation. But traces of the old forms of action remain. For example, it is not necessary to show that a claimant has provided consideration where she sues on a deed. This is because consideration was never a requirement in the action of debt ''sur obligation''.
* ''Tort.'' The various writs which involved complaint of a civil wrong and a demand for a remedy came together in a [[English tort law|law of tort]]. 
* ''Unjust enrichment.'' At first, common law restitutionary obligations were appended to the law of contract and said to form a law of [[quasi-contract]]. Motivated by the writing of scholars from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge university|Cambridge]] the courts gradually accepted that such obligations were of another kind, underpinned by the concept of [[unjust enrichment]].&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Robert Goff and Gareth Jones, ''The Law of Restitution'' (1st ed, 1966); Peter Birks, ''An Introduction to the Law of Restitution'' (1985); Virgo, ''Principles of the Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2011); Andrew Burrows, ''Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd]]'' [1991] the House of Lords explicitly recognised the independent existence of the [[English unjust enrichment law|law of unjust enrichment]].

==South Australia==

The ''Common Law Procedure Act 1852'' (15 and 16 Vic., c. 76) was enacted prior to the promulgation of the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 and while it was repealed in England, continued to apply by paramount force in South Australia.
The Supreme Court Act 1935&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/sca1935183/ | title=Supreme Court Act 1935 (South Australia) | publisher=Austlii | accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; grants to the Supreme Court of South Australia the like jurisdiction exercised by both the common law and equity courts of England prior to the enactment of the Judiciary Acts which included the initiation of a personal jurisdiction over a person in a case by virtue of the issue of a writ of summons. The judges of the Court were given power to regulate the procedure of the Court within jurisdiction and preserved the Rules of Court extant at 1935 in cases not otherwise provided for. The writ of summons is the common originating process, but takes a form approved under the present rules.

==United States==

The forms of action survived much longer in the United States.  New York was the first to abolish them, by enacting a Code of Civil Procedure in 1850 at the suggestion of [[David Dudley Field II]].  Twenty-three other states eventually followed.  Section 307 of the [[California Code of Civil Procedure]] is a typical example of how the forms of action were abolished in those states: "There is in this State but one form of civil actions for the enforcement or protection of private rights and the redress or prevention of private wrongs."

However, the forms of action persisted in the federal courts until 1938, when the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] were promulgated pursuant to the [[Rules Enabling Act]]. Rule 2, at that time, stated: "There shall be one form of action to be known as 'civil action.'"  Since 35 U.S. states now use versions of the FRCP in their state courts and the remaining 15 states are all "code pleading" states{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}, so the forms of action are now obsolete in the United States.

The '''Global Maritime Distress and Safety System''' ('''GMDSS''') is an internationally agreed-upon set of safety procedures, types of equipment, and communication protocols used to increase safety and make it easier to rescue distressed ships, boats and aircraft.

GMDSS consists of several systems, some of which are new, but many of which have been in operation for many years. The system is intended to perform the following functions: alerting (including position determination of the unit in distress), [[search and rescue]] coordination, locating (homing), [[maritime safety information]] broadcasts, general communications, and [[bridge-to-bridge communications]]. Specific radio carriage requirements depend upon the ship's area of operation, rather than its [[tonnage]]. The system also provides redundant means of distress alerting, and emergency sources of power.

Recreational vessels do not need to comply with GMDSS radio carriage requirements, but will increasingly use the [[Digital Selective Calling]] (DSC)Wwsos [[Marine VHF radio]]s. Offshore vessels may elect to equip themselves further. Vessels under 300 [[gross tonnage]] (GT) are not subject to GMDSS requirements.

==History==
Since the [[invention of radio]] at the end of the 19th century, ships at sea have relied on [[Morse code]], invented by [[Samuel Morse]] and first used in 1844, for distress and safety telecommunications. The need for ship and coast radio stations to have and use radiotelegraph equipment, and to listen to a common radio frequency for Morse encoded distress calls, was recognized after the sinking of the liner [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] in the North Atlantic in 1912. The [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] enacted legislation soon after, requiring U.S. ships to use Morse code radiotelegraph equipment for distress calls. The [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU), now a United Nations agency, followed suit for ships of all nations. Morse encoded distress calling has saved thousands of lives since its inception almost a century ago, but its use requires skilled radio operators spending many hours listening to the radio distress frequency. Its range on the [[medium frequency]] (MF) distress band ([[500 kHz]]) is limited, and the amount of traffic Morse signals can carry is also limited.

Not all ship-to-shore radio communications were short range. Some radio stations provided long-range radiotelephony services, such as radio [[telegram]]s and radio [[teleprinter#Telex|telex]] calls, on the [[high frequency|HF]] bands (3–30&amp;nbsp;[[MHz]]) enabling worldwide communications with ships. For example, [[Portishead Radio]], which was the world's busiest radiotelephony station, provided HF long-range services.&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{cite journal

 | accessdate=January 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such large radiotelephony stations employed large numbers of people and were expensive to operate. By the end of the 1980s, satellite services had started to take an increasingly large share of the market for ship-to-shore communications.

For these reasons, the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO), a United Nations agency specializing in safety of shipping and preventing ships from polluting the seas, began looking at ways of improving maritime distress and safety communications. In 1979, a group of experts drafted the [[International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue]], which called for development of a global search and rescue plan. This group also passed a resolution calling for development by IMO of a Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) to provide the communication support needed to implement the search and rescue plan. This new system, which the world's maritime nations are implementing, is based upon a combination of [[satellite]] and terrestrial radio services, and has changed international distress communications from being primarily ship-to-ship based to ship-to-shore (Rescue Coordination Center) based. It spelled the end of Morse code communications for all but a few users, such as [[amateur radio operator]]s. The GMDSS provides for automatic distress alerting and locating in cases where a radio operator doesn't have time to send an [[SOS]] or [[Mayday (distress signal)|MAYDAY]] call, and, for the first time, requires ships to receive broadcasts of maritime safety information which could prevent a disaster from happening in the first place. In 1988, IMO amended the Safety of Life at Sea ([[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea|SOLAS]]) Convention, requiring ships subject to it fit GMDSS equipment. Such ships were required to carry NAVTEX and satellite EPIRBs by August 1, 1993, and had to fit all other GMDSS equipment by February 1, 1999. US ships were allowed to fit GMDSS in lieu of Morse telegraphy equipment by the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]].

==Components of GMDSS==
The main types of equipment used in GMDSS are:

===Emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB)===
{{Main|Emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station}}

[[Cospas-Sarsat]] is an international [[satellite]]-based search and rescue system, established by Canada, France, the United States, and Russia. These four countries jointly helped develop the 406&amp;nbsp;MHz  [[Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon]] (EPIRB), an element of the GMDSS designed to operate with Cospas-Sarsat system. These automatic-activating EPIRBs, now required on [[SOLAS Convention|SOLAS]] ships, commercial fishing vessels, and all passenger ships, are designed to transmit to alert rescue coordination centers via the satellite system from anywhere in the world. The original COSPAS/SARSAT system used polar orbiting satellites but in recent years the system has been expanded to also include 4 geostationary satellites. Newest designs incorporate [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers to transmit highly accurate positions (within about 20 metres) of the distress position. The original COSPAS/SARSAT satellites could calculate EPIRB position to within about {{convert|3|nmi|km}} by using Doppler techniques. By the end of 2010 EPIRB manufacturers may be offering AIS ([[automatic identification system]]) enabled beacons. The serviceability of these items is checked monthly and annually and they have limited battery shelf life, between two and five years using mostly lithium-type batteries. 406&amp;nbsp;MHz EPIRB's transmit a registration number which is linked to a database of information about the vessel.

===NAVTEX===
{{Main|Navtex}}

[[Navtex]] is an international, automated system for instantly distributing [[maritime safety information]] (MSI) which includes navigational warnings, weather forecasts and weather warnings, search and rescue notices and similar information to ships. A small, low-cost and self-contained "smart" printing radio receiver is installed on the bridge, or the place from where the ship is navigated, and checks each incoming message to see if it has been received during an earlier transmission, or if it is of a category of no interest to the ship's master. The frequency of transmission of these messages is 518&amp;nbsp;kHz in English, while 490&amp;nbsp;kHz is sometime used to broadcast in a local language.
The messages are coded with a header code identified by the using single letters of the alphabet to represent broadcasting stations, type of messages, and followed by two figures indicating the serial number of the message.
For example:
'''FA56''' where '''F''' is the ID of the transmitting station, '''A''' indicates the message category ''navigational warning'', and '''56''' is the consecutive message number.

===Satellite===
As of April 2018 the only provider of GMDSS satellite services is INMARSAT. However [[Iridium satellite constellation]]/HIBLEO 2 is in the process of applying to become a GMDSS service provider. [[Thuraya]] has also indicated that it may be interested in becoming a GMDSS service provider in the future.
Satellite systems operated by the [[Inmarsat]] company, overseen by the [[International Mobile Satellite Organization]] (IMSO) are important elements of the GMDSS. The types of Inmarsat ship earth station terminals recognized by the GMDSS are: Inmarsat C and F77. Inmarsat F77, an updated version of the now redundant Inmarsat A and B, provide [[ship-to-shore]], [[ship-to-ship]] and [[shore-to-ship]] telephone, [[telex]] and high-speed data services, including a distress priority telephone and telex service to and from rescue coordination centers. Fleet 77 fully supports the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) and includes advanced features such as emergency call prioritisation. Unfortunately Fleet 77 has an end of life scheduled for 1st of December 2020. No definite alternatives are currently defined. The Inmarsat C provides ship/shore, shore/ship and ship/ship store-and-forward data and email messaging, the capability for sending preformatted distress messages to a rescue coordination center, and the Inmarsat C SafetyNET service. The Inmarsat C SafetyNET service is a satellite-based worldwide maritime safety information broadcast service of high seas weather warnings, [[NAVAREA]] navigational warnings, [[radionavigation]] warnings, ice reports and warnings generated by the USCG-conducted [[International Ice Patrol]], and other similar information not provided by NAVTEX. SafetyNET works similarly to NAVTEX in areas outside NAVTEX coverage.

Inmarsat C equipment is relatively small and lightweight, and costs much less than a F77 station. A F77 ship earth station requires a relatively large gyro-stabilized unidirectional antennas; the antenna size of the Inmarsat C is much smaller and is omnidirectional. Inmarsat C being a low power system allows for its operation from the vessels emergency 24volt battery supply under emergency conditions. This coupled to the omni directional antenna arrangements allow for a guaranteed response to a distress alert between 76 degrees North and 76 degrees South (Sea area A3).

Under a cooperative agreement with the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), combined meteorological observations and [[AMVER]] reports can now be sent to both the USCG AMVER Center, and NOAA, using an Inmarsat C ship earth station, at no charge.

SOLAS now requires that Inmarsat C equipment have an integral satellite navigation receiver, or be externally connected to a satellite navigation receiver. That connection will ensure accurate location information to be sent to a rescue coordination center if a distress alert is ever transmitted.

Also the new LRIT long range tracking systems are upgraded via GMDSS Inmarsat C which are also compliant along with inbuilt SSAS, or ship security alert system. SSAS provides a means to covertly transmit a security alert distress message to local authorities in the event of a mutiny, pirate attack, or other hostile action towards the vessel or its crew.

===High frequency===
A GMDSS system may include [[high-frequency]] (HF) radiotelephone and [[radioteletype|radiotelex]] (narrow-band direct printing) equipment, with calls initiated by [[digital selective calling]] (DSC). Worldwide broadcasts of maritime safety information can also be made on HF narrow-band direct printing channels. All ships trading in Sea area A4 must carry HF DSC and NDBP equipment which can also operate from the ships reserve energy supply (typically a 24v battery supply). This HF provision is necessary as the Inmarsat coverage does not extend to the polar regions.

===Search and rescue locating device===
{{Main|Search and rescue transponder}}

The GMDSS installation on ships include one (two on vessels over 500 GT) search-and-rescue locating device called Search and Rescue Radar Transponders (SART) which are used to locate survival craft or distressed vessels by creating a series of twelve dots on a rescuing ship's 3&amp;nbsp;cm [[radar]] display. The detection range between these devices and ships, dependent upon the height of the ship's radar mast and the height of the Search and Rescue Locating device, is normally about 15&amp;nbsp;km (8 nautical miles).
Once detected by radar, the Search and Rescue Locating device will produce a visual and aural indication to the persons in distress.

===Digital selective calling ===
{{Main|Digital selective calling}}
The IMO also introduced digital selective calling (DSC) on MF, HF and [[VHF maritime radio]]s as part of the GMDSS system. DSC is primarily intended to initiate ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore and shore-to-ship radiotelephone and MF/HF radiotelex calls. DSC calls can also be made to individual stations, groups of stations, or "all stations" in one's radio range. Each DSC-equipped ship, shore station and group is assigned a unique 9-digit [[Maritime Mobile Service Identity]].

DSC distress alerts, which consist of a preformatted distress message, are used to initiate emergency communications with ships and rescue coordination centers. DSC was intended to eliminate the need for persons on a ship's bridge or on shore to continuously guard radio receivers on voice radio channels, including VHF channel 16 (156.8&amp;nbsp;MHz) and [[2182 kHz]] now used for distress, safety and calling. A listening watch aboard GMDSS-equipped ships on 2182&amp;nbsp;kHz ended on February 1, 1999. In May 2002, IMO decided to postpone cessation of a VHF listening watch aboard ships. That watchkeeping requirement had been scheduled to end on February 1, 2005.

IMO and ITU both require that the DSC-equipped MF/HF and VHF radios be externally connected to a satellite navigation receiver (GPS). That connection will ensure accurate location information is sent to a rescue coordination center if a distress alert is transmitted. The FCC requires that all new VHF and MF/HF maritime radiotelephones type accepted after June 1999 have at least a basic DSC capability.

VHF digital selective calling also has other capabilities beyond those required for the GMDSS. The US Coast Guard uses this system to track vessels in Prince William Sound, Alaska, Vessel Traffic Service. IMO and the USCG also plan to require ships carry a Universal Shipborne [[automatic identification system]], which will be DSC-compatible. Countries having a GMDSS A1 Area should be able to identify and track AIS-equipped vessels in its waters without any additional radio equipment. A DSC-equipped radio cannot be interrogated and tracked unless that option was included by the manufacturer, and unless the user configures it to allow tracking.

GMDSS telecommunications equipment should not be reserved for emergency use only. The International Maritime Organization encourages mariners to use GMDSS equipment for routine as well as safety telecommunications.

===Power supply requirements===
GMDSS equipment is required to be powered from three sources of supply:

* ship's normal alternators/generators;
* ship's emergency alternator/generator (if fitted); and
* a dedicated radio battery supply.

The batteries are required to have a capacity to power the equipment for 1 hour on ships with an emergency generator or built prior to February 1995, and 6 hours on ships not fitted with an emergency generator or built after February 1995 in order to comply with SOLAS. The batteries must be charged by an automatic charger, which is also required to be powered from the main and emergency generators. Changeover from AC to battery supply must be automatic, and effected in such a way that any data held by the equipment is not corrupted ("no break").

During Coast Guard inspections, the batteries must be able to go from 100% discharge to fully charged in no longer than 10 hours in order to pass certification. The charger too must be obtainable at all times during vessel operation and should be inspected to make sure it functions properly. When the reserve source of energy consists of batteries, the battery capacity must be checked at intervals not exceeding 12 months. If not completed within past 12 months, this must be done during inspection.

Storage batteries provided as a reserve source of energy must be installed in accordance with applicable electrical codes and good engineering practice. They must be protected from adverse weather and physical damage. They must be readily accessible for maintenance and replacement.

==GMDSS sea areas==
GMDSS sea areas serve two purposes: to describe areas where GMDSS services are available, and to define what radio equipment GMDSS ships must carry (carriage requirements). Prior to the GMDSS, the number and type of radio safety equipment ships had to carry depended upon its tonnage. With GMDSS, the number and type of radio safety equipment ships have to carry depends upon the GMDSS areas in which they travel. GMDSS sea areas are classified in four areas: A1, A2, A3 and A4.

In addition to equipment listed below, all GMDSS-regulated ships must carry a satellite EPIRB, a NAVTEX receiver (if they travel in any areas served by NAVTEX), an Inmarsat-C SafetyNET receiver (if they travel in any areas not served by NAVTEX), a DSC-equipped VHF radiotelephone, two (if between 300 and less than 500 GRT) or three VHF handhelds (if 500 GRT or more), and two 9&amp;nbsp;GHz search and rescue radar transponders (SART).

===Sea Area A1===
An area within the radiotelephone coverage of at least one VHF coast station in which continuous digital selective calling (Ch.70/156.525&amp;nbsp;MHz) alerting and radiotelephony services are available. Such an area could extend typically {{convert|30|to|40|nmi|km}} from the Coast Station.

=== Sea area A2 ===
An area within a coverage of at least one coast station continuous  listening on MF (2187.5 kHz) other than Area A1

===Sea Area A3===
An area, excluding sea areas A1 and A2, within the coverage of an Inmarsat [[geostationary satellite]]. This area lies between about latitude 76 Degrees North and South, but excludes A1 and/or A2 designated areas. Inmarsat guarantees their system will work between 70 South and 70 North though it will often work to 76 degrees South or North.

===Sea Area A4===
An area outside Sea Areas A1, A2 and A3 is called Sea Area A4. This is essentially the polar regions, north and south of about 76 degrees of [[latitude]], excluding any A1, A2 and A3 areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.imo.org/blast/blastDataHelper.asp?data_id=10750&amp;filename=32.pdf| title=Harmonization of GMDSS Requirements for Radio Installations on Board SOLAS Ships| publisher=IMO| date=16 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GMDSS radio equipment required for U.S. coastal voyages===
Presently, until an A1 or A2 Sea Area is established, GMDSS-mandated ships operating off the U.S. coast must fit to Sea Areas A3 (or A4) regardless of where they operate. U.S. ships whose voyage allows them to always remain within VHF channel 16 coverage of U.S. Coast Guard stations may apply to the Federal Communications Commission for an individual waiver to fit to Sea Area A1 requirements. Similarly, those who remain within 2182&amp;nbsp;kHz coverage of U.S. Coast Guard stations may apply for a waiver to fit to Sea Area A2 requirements.

As of August 2013, the U.S. Coast Guard provides a Sea Area A1 service through its [[Rescue 21]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GMDSS AREAS AND SEARCH AND RESCUE AREAS|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=gmdssArea|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RESCUE 21 DISTRESS SYSTEM COVERAGE|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=mtNds|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licensing of operators==
National maritime authorities may issue various classes of licenses.
The General Operator’s Certificate is required on SOLAS vessels operating also outside GMDSS Sea Area A1, while a Restricted Operator’s Certificate is needed on SOLAS vessels operated solely within GMDSS Sea Area A1,

[[Long Range Certificate]] may be issued, and is required on non-SOLAS vessels operating outside GMDSS Sea Area A1, while a [[Short Range Certificate]] is issued for non-SOLAS vessels operating only inside GMDSS Sea Area A1.

Finally there is a restricted radiotelephone operator's certificate, which is similar to the [[Short Range Certificate]] but limited VHF DSC radio operation. Some countries do not consider this adequate for GMDSS qualification.

In the United States four different GMDSS certificates are issued:

* A GMDSS Radio Maintainer's License allows a person to maintain, install, and repair GMDSS equipment at sea.
* A GMDSS Radio Operator's License is necessary for a person to use required GMDSS equipment.
* The holder of both certificates can be issued one GMDSS Radio Operator/Maintainer License.
* Finally, the '''GMDSS Restricted License''' is available for VHF operations only within {{convert|20|nmi|km}} of the coast.

To obtain any of these licenses a person must be a U.S. citizen or otherwise eligible for work in the country, be able to communicate in English, and take written examinations approved by the [[Federal Communications Commission]]. Like the [[amateur radio]] examinations, these are given by private, FCC-approved groups. These are generally not the same agencies who administer the ham tests. Written test elements 1 and 7 are required for the Operator license, and elements 1 and 7R for the Restricted Operator. (Passing element 1 also automatically qualifies the applicant for the Marine Radiotelephone Operator Permit, the MROP.)

For the Maintainer license, written exam element 9 must be passed. However, to obtain this certificate an applicant must also hold a [[General radiotelephone operator license]] (GROL), which requires passing commercial written exam elements 1 and 3 (and thus supersedes the MROP). Upon the further passing of optional written exam element 8 the ship radar endorsement will be added to both the GROL and Maintainer licenses. This allows the holder to adjust, maintain, and repair shipboard [[radar]] equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wireless.fcc.gov/commoperators/ FCC – Commercial Radio Operator Licenses&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until March 25, 2008 GMDSS operator and maintainer licenses expired after five years but could be renewed upon payment of a fee. On that date all new certificates were issued valid for the lifetimes of their holders. For those still valid but previously issued with expiration dates, the FCC states:

Any GMDSS Radio Operator's License, Restricted GMDSS Radio Operator's License, GMDSS Radio Maintainer's License, GMDSS Radio Operator/Maintainer License, or Marine Radio Operator Permit that was active, i.e., had not expired, as of March 25, 2008, does not have to be renewed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wireless.fcc.gov/commoperators/index.htm?job=terms_license Commercial Radio Operator License Program: Term of Licenses]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since an older certificate does show an expiration date, for crewmembers sailing internationally it may be worth paying the fee (as of 2010 it was $60) to avoid any confusion with local authorities.

Finally, to actually serve as a GMDSS operator on most commercial vessels the [[United States Coast Guard]] requires additional classroom training and practical experience beyond just holding a license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pdf/gmdss/taskForce/Training_and_Certification_of_GMDSS_Radio_Operators.pdf GMDSS Training and Certification]&lt;/ref&gt;

  |Holding=Restrictions on speech that take place in a limited public forum must not discriminate on the basis of the speaker's viewpoint and be reasonable in light of the forum's purpose.  Because the school's exclusion of the Good News Club violated this principle, the school violated the Club's free speech rights guaranteed by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].  Furthermore, the school's claim that allowing the club to meet on its property would violate the [[Establishment Clause]] lacked merit and thus was no defense to the club's First Amendment claim.

'''''Good News Club v. Milford Central School''''', 533 U.S. 98 (2001), held that when a government operates a "[[limited public forum]]," it may not discriminate against speech that takes place within that forum on the basis of the viewpoint it expresses—in this case, against religious speech engaged in by an [[evangelical Christian]] club for children.&lt;ref name=GoodNewsClub&gt;{{ussc|name=Good News Club v. Milford Central School|link=|volume=533|page=98|pin=|year=2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
Under New York law, public schools may adopt regulations under which they open their facilities to public use during non-school hours.  In 1992, Milford Central -School adopted regulations under this law, allowing district residents to use the school for "instruction in any branch of education, learning, or the arts," and making the school available for "social, civic, and recreational meetings and entertainment events, and other uses pertaining to the welfare of the community, provided that such uses shall be nonexclusive and shall be opened to the general public."

The Fourniers, who reside in the district, applied to use the Milford Central School for meetings of a [[Good News Club]].  Their proposed use—to have "a fun time of singing songs, hearing a Bible lesson and memorizing scripture"—was deemed to be the equivalent of religious worship, and the Fourniers' application was denied on that basis; the school also claimed that its community use policy forbade use "by any individual or organization for religious purposes."  The Fourniers contacted the school superintendent stating that they did not believe it was lawful for the school to allow other groups to use the school building, yet because they were religious in nature, teaching morals and values from a Christian perspective, they were denied access.  The school concluded that "the kinds of activities proposed to be engaged in by the Good News Club were not a discussion of secular subjects such as child rearing, development of character and development of morals from a religious perspective, but were in fact the equivalent of religious instruction itself."  The full school board rejected the club's application to use Milford's facilities.

The Fourniers and the Good News Club filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York]] under [[Civil Rights Act of 1871|42 U.S.C. § 1983]] against the school.  The club alleged that the school's denial of its application violated its free speech rights under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], as well as its right to religious freedom under the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]].  The club won a preliminary injunction allowing it to conduct its meetings at the school from April 1997 to August 1998.  In August 1998, however, the district court ruled against the club, finding that the club's "subject matter is decidedly religious in nature, and not merely a discussion of secular matters from a religious perspective that is otherwise permitted" by the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Good News Club v. Milford Central School |vol=21 |reporter=F. Supp. 2d |opinion=147 |pinpoint= |court=N.D.N.Y. |date=1998 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/21/147/2577722/ |accessdate=2018-11-19 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the school forbade all religious instruction under its policy, the court ruled that it was not engaging in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.

The club appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit]].  The Second Circuit affirmed, holding that the school's restriction was not unreasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Good News Club v. Milford Central School |vol=202 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=502 |pinpoint= |court=2d Cir. |date=2000 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/202/502/592617/ |accessdate=2018-11-19 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In light of the "quintessentially religious" nature of the club's activities, the court further held that the school district was engaging in "constitutional subject discrimination" rather than "unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination" when it excluded the club from meeting on its premises.  In light of a split among the federal appeals courts regarding whether speech may be excluded from a limited public forum by reason of its religious content, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the Second Circuit's ruling in this case. Thomas Marcelle represented the Good News Club at oral argument, and Frank Miller represented Milford Central School.&lt;ref name=GoodNewsClub/&gt;

==Majority opinion==
When the government establishes a "[[limited public forum]]," it is not required to permit any and all speech within that forum.  It may "reserve its forum for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics".  However, the government may not discriminate against speech on the basis of its viewpoint, and any restriction it imposes must be reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum.&lt;ref name=GoodNewsClub/&gt;

The Court saw no distinction between the viewpoint discrimination in this case and the viewpoint discrimination in two of its earlier cases:  ''[[Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School District]]'', {{ussc|508|384|1993|el=no}},&lt;ref name=Lamb&gt;{{ussc|name=Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School District|link=|volume=508|page=384|pin=|year=1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Rosenberger v. University of Virginia]]'', {{ussc|515|819|1995|el=no}}.&lt;ref name=Rosenberger&gt;{{ussc|name=Rosenberger v. University of Virginia|link=|volume=515|page=819|pin=|year=1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Lamb's Chapel'', the Court held that a school district violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment's]] Free Speech Clause when it excluded a private group from presenting films at the school solely on the basis of the religious perspective of the films on family values.&lt;ref name=Lamb/&gt; And in ''Rosenberger'', the Court held that a university's refusal to fund a student publication because of that publication's religious perspective violated the Free Speech Clause.&lt;ref name=Rosenberger/&gt; Milford's exclusion is indistinguishable from the exclusions at issue in ''Lamb's Chapel'' and ''Rosenberger'', and so the Court did not need to decide "whether it is unreasonable in light of the purposes served by the forum."

"Milford has opened its limited public forum to activities that serve a variety of purposes, including events pertaining to the welfare of the community."  Milford had asserted before the Second Circuit that it would have allowed a public group to use [[Aesop's fables]] to impart moral values to children.  Milford also allowed the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] to "influence a boy's character, development, and spiritual growth".  Likewise, the Good News Club also sought to teach moral values to children, albeit from an explicitly Christian viewpoint.

According to the majority, the Court's prior decisions in ''Lamb's Chapel'' and ''Rosenberger'' determined the outcome of the Good News Club's free speech claim.  In ''Lamb's Chapel'', the Court had ruled that a different New York public school had engaged in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination when it forbade a religious group from using its facilities to show films that taught "family values from a Christian perspective".  It saw no difference between the films that the religious group in ''Lamb's Chapel'' proposed to show and the songs and lessons the Good News Club used in this case.  And in ''Rosenberger'', the fact that a state university subsidized the publication of some student newspapers but refused to subsidize a student newspaper with a religious viewpoint was also unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.

In spite of these decisions, the Second Circuit had ruled in this case that the religious nature of the Good News Club's message meant that it "fell outside the bounds of" speech related to "pure moral and character development", and hence was not entitled to First Amendment protection.  The majority on the Supreme Court "disagreed that something that is 'quintessentially religious' or 'decidedly religious in nature' cannot also be characterized properly as the teaching of morals and character development from a particular viewpoint.  What matters for purposes of the Free Speech Clause is that we can see no logical difference in kind between the invocation of Christianity by the Club and the invocation of teamwork, loyalty, or patriotism by other associations to provide a foundation for their lessons."  Instruction related to morals and values from a religious perspective does not somehow "taint" that instruction so as to alter the viewpoint such instruction takes.  Accordingly, Milford's exclusion of the Good News Club constituted unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.

===The Establishment Clause claim===
Milford also argued that its interest in not violating the [[Establishment Clause]] justified its excluding the Good News Club from its facilities.  In ''[[Widmar v. Vincent]]'', {{ussc|454|263|1981|el=no}}, the Court held that "a state interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation may be characterized as compelling, and therefore may justify content-based discrimination" on the part of the state entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Widmar v. Vincent|link=|volume=454|page=263|pin=|year=1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  But in ''Lamb's Chapel'', the Court left open the question of whether such a concern could also justify ''viewpoint'' discrimination.  The Court ruled that it could not, and gave four reasons for distinguishing content-based discrimination from viewpoint discrimination on this score.

First, the exception created in ''Widmar'' rested on the fact that the government program was neutral toward religion.  "The Good News Club seeks nothing more than to be treated neutrally and given access to speak about the same topics as are other groups."  Milford's policy was not neutral with respect to religious speech—it allowed some speech that took a particular viewpoint, but forbade speech that took the same viewpoint on the basis of the religious nature of the speech.

Second, to the extent the Club's speech would be perceived as coercive, that coercion would be felt by the parents rather than the children.  After all, parents must give their children permission to attend the Club's activities.  Milford did not suggest that the parents would be confused about the religious nature of the Club's message.

Third, and relatedly, the Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence never "extended ... to foreclose private religious conduct during nonschool hours merely because it takes place on school premises where elementary school children may be present."  In ''[[Lee v. Weisman]]'', {{ussc|505|577|1992|el=no}}, the religious speech involved was a prayer at a mandatory high school graduation function.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Lee v. Weisman|link=|volume=505|page=577|pin=|year=1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe]]'', {{ussc|530|290|2000|el=no}}, the religious speech involved was a student-led prayer before a high school football game which, of course, is a school-sponsored event.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe|link=|volume=530|page=290|pin=|year=2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'', {{ussc|482|578|1987|el=no}}, the religious speech involved was a prohibition on teaching evolution in public school science classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Edwards v. Aguillard|link=|volume=482|page=578|pin=|year=1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike these three cases, the religious speech at issue in this case took place after school and not during a school-sponsored event.

Fourth, the children required their parents permission to attend the Club's activities; they were not permitted to "loiter outside classrooms after the schoolday has ended".  The Club was using space on the school grounds into which elementary school children did not typically venture during school hours, and elementary school students of all grade levels attended the Club's activities.  The instructors are not schoolteachers.  The Court doubted that even small children would perceive that the school was endorsing religion in these circumstances, and that doubt was even more attenuated by the fact that the children were just as likely to perceive official condemnation of religion from the school's excluding the Club from its facilities.

All these considerations suggested that there was no Establishment Clause violation involved in Milford's permitting the Club to meet on its premises after school hours.  Accordingly, Milford's fear of an Establishment Clause violation did not justify forbidding the Club from using its facilities.

===Scalia's concurring opinion===
[[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]] concurred in the Court's opinion, but wrote separately to express his own views.  He did not believe that the Club's activities were coercive at all.  "As to endorsement, I have previously written that religious expression cannot violate the Establishment Clause where it (1) is purely private and (2) occurs in a traditional or designated public forum, publicly announced and open to all on equal terms.  The same is true of private speech that occurs in a limited public forum, publicly announced, whose boundaries are not drawn in favor of religious groups but instead permit a cross-section of uses."  Milford could not justify excluding the Club simply because its speech was religious in nature, and so Scalia did not worry whether the discrimination was content-based or viewpoint-based.  In any event, Scalia stressed that Milford was engaging in viewpoint discrimination.

===Breyer's concurring opinion===
[[Stephen Breyer|Justice Breyer]] disputed the majority's assumption that the perception of the children was irrelevant.  Even in ''Lamb's Chapel'', the Court had relied in part on the perception of the children in determining whether there had been an Establishment Clause violation.  "The critical Establishment Clause question here may well prove to be whether a child, participating in the Good News Club's activities, could reasonably perceive the endorsement of religion" on the part of the school.  Breyer pointed out that the Court's decision merely overturned a grant of [[summary judgment]] in favor of Milford, and denying summary judgment to one party was not the same as granting it to the other party.  Denials of summary judgment simply mean that there are "genuine issues of material fact" that require a trial.  The extent of the coercion perceived by the children was, in Breyer's view, one such issue.

==Dissenting opinions==
For [[John Paul Stevens|Justice Stevens]], speech that embodied a religious purpose fell into three categories.  One category included speech that approached a particular topic from a religious perspective.  Another category included speech that "amounts to worship, or its equivalent."  Between these two categories, Stevens posited a third category—religious proselytizing.  This case, then, involved a government entity attempting to open its facilities to allow the first category of religious speech on its property but not the other two categories.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;Distinguishing speech from a religious viewpoint, on the one hand, from religious proselytizing, on the other, is comparable to distinguishing meetings to discuss political issues from meetings whose principal purpose is to recruit new members to join a political organization.  If a school decides to authorize afterschool discussions of current events in its classrooms, it may not exclude people from expressing their views simply because it dislikes their particular political opinions.  But must it therefore allow organized political groups—for example, the Democratic Party, the Libertarian Party, or the Ku Klux Klan—to hold meetings, the principal purpose of which is not to discuss the current-events topic from their own unique point of view but rather to recruit others to join their respective groups?  I think not.  Such recruiting meetings may introduce divisiveness and tend to separate young children into cliques that undermine the school's educational mission.  School officials may reasonably believe that evangelical meetings designed to convert children to a particular religious faith may pose the same risk.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

Even if the Club's speech was not properly classified as religious worship, it certainly was religious proselytism, and the school was within its rights to exclude the Club from campus.

[[David Souter|Justice Souter]] was more direct.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is beyond question that Good News intends to use the public school premises not for the mere discussion of a subject from a particular, Christian point of view, but for an evangelical service of worship calling children to commit themselves in an act of Christian conversion.  The majority avoids this reality only by resorting to the bland and general characterization of Good News's activity as 'teaching of morals and character, from a religious standpoint'.  If the majority's statement ignores reality, as it surely does, then today's holding may be understood only in equally generic terms.  Otherwise, indeed, this case would stand for the remarkable proposition that any public school opened for civic meetings must be opened for use as a church, synagogue, or mosque.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Souter also disputed that it was proper for the Court to reach the Establishment Clause claim.  Neither the district court nor the Second Circuit had based their rulings on the Establishment Clause, because they had found no First Amendment violation stemming from Milford's actions.  Consequently, the facts relating to the Establishment Clause claim were not as well developed as they otherwise might have been.  Furthermore, Souter disagreed that this case was so similar to ''Widmar'' and ''Lamb's Chapel'' as the majority claimed.  ''Widmar'' involved a university student group, one of over a hundred on campus, that used university space for religious worship.  In that case, Souter pointed out, the risk of the university being seen as endorsing the worship was low in light of the number of student groups on campus and the level of maturity of the students.  The film in ''Lamb's Chapel'' was open to the general public and aimed at adults, not children, and the school facilities had been used by a wide variety of private organizations, just as there were a large number of student groups in ''Widmar''.  The Good News Club, by contrast, began setting up its meetings almost half an hour before the school day ended and in a classroom adjacent to the third- and fourth-grade classroom, so that those students, at least, would see the Club every time it came to campus.  In view of the state of the recorde, the "facts we know (or think we know) point away from the majority's conclusion, and while the consolation may be that nothing really gets resolved when the judicial process is so truncated, that is not much to recommend today's result."

'''The DNA Based Technology (Use and Regulation) Bill, 2017''' or the '''Human DNA Profiling Bill''' is a proposed legislation in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Lokniti Foundation: Behind's Centre's Aadhaar-Mobile Linking Policy Is A Petrol-Pump Owner, A Serving Cop, And A Retired CBI Officer |url=https://m.huffingtonpost.in/2018/04/27/lokniti-foundation-behinds-centres-aadhaar-mobile-linking-policy-is-a-petrol-pump-owner-a-serving-cop-and-a-retired-cbi-officer_a_23421900/ |work=[[Huffpost]] |date=28 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill will allow the government to establish a National DNA Data Bank and a DNA Profiling Board, and use the data for various specified forensic purposes. The bill has raised concerns of [[privacy]] among citizen rights groups.&lt;ref name=Roadblock&gt;{{cite news|title=Centre's ambitious DNA Profiling Bill hits privacy roadblock   |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/modi-government-ambitious-dna-profiling-bill-roadblock-ngos/1/383041.html|accessdate=5 January 2015|work=[[India Today]]|date=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was expected to be presented in the parliament in the monsoon session of 2015.&lt;ref name=FEx-DNA&gt;{{cite news|title=Human DNA Profiling Bill: A tool that could be misused|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/article/fe-columnist/human-dna-profiling-bill-a-tool-that-could-be-misused/108561/|accessdate=4 August 2015|date=27 July 2015|work=[[The Financial Express (India)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The bill was originally proposed in 2007 and in 2012 drafting of the bill began.&lt;ref name=Roadblock/&gt; The draft bill was prepared by the [[Department of Biotechnology]].&lt;ref name=Coming&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill to create bank for DNA profiling of accused coming|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bill-to-create-bank-for-dna-profiling-of-accused-coming/article4019621.ece|accessdate=5 January 2015|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill proposes to form a National DNA Data Bank and a DNA Profiling Board, and use the data for various specified purposes.&lt;ref name=Roadblock/&gt;

The proposed DNA Profiling Board will consist of molecular biology, human genetics, population biology, bioethics, social sciences, law and criminal justice experts. The Board will define standards and controls for DNA profiling. It will also certify labs and handle access of the data by law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name=Roadblock/&gt; There will be similar bodies at state levels.&lt;ref name=Coming/&gt;

The bill will also create a National DNA Data Bank, which will collect data from offenders, suspects, missing persons, unidentified dead bodies and volunteers.&lt;ref name=Moot/&gt; It will profile and store DNA data in criminal cases like homicide, sexual assault, adultery and other crimes. The data will be restricted and will be available only to the accused or the suspect. A person facing imprisonment or death sentence can send a request for DNA profiling of related evidence to the court that convicted him.&lt;ref name=Coming/&gt;

The bill has the provision that any misuse of data will carry a punishment of up to three years imprisonment and also fine.&lt;ref name=Coming/&gt;

==Criticism and support==
The bill has been criticised for not addressing the concerns of privacy.&lt;ref name=Roadblock/&gt; The Citizens Forum for Civil Liberties has opposed the bill on privacy concerns and sent a complaint to the [[National Human Rights Commission of India]] in 2012.&lt;ref name=Coming/&gt;

===A. P. Shah committee report===
In October 2012, an expert committee headed by [[Ajit Prakash Shah]] presented its report. It said that there should be safeguards to prevent illegal collection and use of DNA data. There should be also safeguards to prevent the proposed body from misusing them. The report also suggested that there should a mechanism using which citizens can appeal against the retention of data. There should also be a mechanism of appeal under which citizens under trial can request a second sample to be taken. The samples must be taken after consent in case of victims and suspects. However, samples can also be taken from crime scenes. The committee noted that although the bill allows volunteers to submit samples, there is no proper procedure to obtain consent and there is no mechanism under which volunteer can withdraw their data. The committee proposed that before giving the data to a third party, the person must be notified and consent must be sought, if the third party is not an authorised agency. The report said that purpose for which data is being collected should be state publicly, and the data should be destroyed after the purpose has been served and the time frame has expired. The report said bodies collecting, analysing and storing DNA data should be made to release an annual report, detailing their practices and organisational structure.&lt;ref name=Moot&gt;{{cite news|title=Experts moot more transparency in bill on DNA profiling|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/experts-moot-more-transparency-in-bill-on-dna-profiling/article4023389.ece?ref=relatedNews|accessdate=5 January 2015|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lokniti Foundation vs Union of India===

In 2012, a [[non-government organization]] (NGO) called Lokniti Foundation filed a [[public interest litigation]] against the government in the [[Supreme Court of India]], Writ Petition (Civil) No.491 of 2012, stating that India does not have a national DNA database to address the issue of thousands of unclaimed dead bodies in India that are reported annually. The Supreme Court asked the government to present a roadmap detailing how the bill will implement mandatory DNA profiling of unclaimed bodies.&lt;ref name=Unclaimed&gt;{{cite news|title=SC wants roadmap for DNA profiling of all unclaimed bodies|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-wants-roadmap-for-DNA-profiling-of-all-unclaimed-bodies/articleshow/38399944.cms|accessdate=5 January 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government replied to concern by stating that the bill will establish a national database which will help identify unclaimed bodies, and returned rescued children and adults to their families. The database would store DNA profiles from the relatives of missing persons, and also from convicts, accused and volunteers.&lt;ref name=DNAbank&gt;{{cite news|title=DNA bank plan unveiled|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1140923/jsp/nation/story_18863201.jsp|accessdate=5 January 2015|work=[[The Telegraph (India)]]|date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government also added in the affidavit that India also lacks trained personnel to implement it &lt;ref name=BillStuck&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill stuck so cannot create DNA data bank: Centre to SC|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/bill-stuck-so-cannot-create-dna-data-bank-centre-to-sc/|accessdate=5 January 2015|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been stated that the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, India was in the process of acquiring specialized software from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), USA for cross matching of DNA profiling data. India has 30-40 DNA examiners and a DNA examiner can handle 100 cases per year. However, India gets 40,000 unclaimed bodies annually, the purpose will require at least 400 DNA examiners. Since, a single case requires {{currency|20,000|INR}}, annually {{currency|80|INR}} [[crore]] will be required for 40,000 cases, excluding salaries of the examiners and support personnel.&lt;ref name=Roadblock/&gt;

The government also said that the final bill will be presented in March 2015. It has been halted due to privacy concerns raised by some NGOs and expert committee set up by the [[Department of Biotechnology]] is addressing them.&lt;ref name=DNAbank/&gt;&lt;ref name=BillStuck/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22193">In [[insurance]], the '''insurance policy''' is a [[contract]] (generally a [[standard form contract]]) between the insurer and the insured, known as the policyholder, which determines the [[claim (legal)|claims]] which the insurer is [[law|legally]] required to pay. In exchange for an initial payment, known as the premium, the insurer promises to pay for loss caused by perils covered under the policy language.

Insurance contracts are designed to meet specific needs and thus have many features not found in many other types of contracts. Since insurance policies are standard forms, they feature [[boilerplate (text)|boilerplate]] language which is similar across a wide variety of different types of insurance policies.&lt;ref name="Mowbray485171"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mowbray|first1=Albert H.|last2=Blanchard|first2=Ralph H.|title=Insurance: Its Theory and Practice in the United States|date=1961|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=48, 51, 71|edition=5th}} Available through [[HeinOnline]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The insurance policy is generally an integrated contract, meaning that it includes all forms associated with the agreement between the insured and insurer.&lt;ref name=Wollner1999&gt;Wollner KS. (1999). How to Draft and Interpret Insurance Policies. Casualty Risk Publishing LLC.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} In some cases, however, supplementary writings such as letters sent after the final agreement can make the insurance policy a non-integrated contract.&lt;ref name=Wollner1999/&gt;{{rp|11}} One insurance textbook states that generally "courts consider all prior negotiations or agreements ... every contractual term in the policy at the time of delivery, as well as those written afterward as policy riders and endorsements ... with both parties' consent, are part of the written policy".&lt;ref name=Porter2007&gt;Porter K. (2007). ''The Legal Environment of Insurance'', §5.17. AICPCU.&lt;/ref&gt; The textbook also states that the policy must refer to all papers which are part of the policy.&lt;ref name=Porter2007/&gt; Oral agreements are subject to the [[parol evidence rule]], and may not be considered part of the policy if the contract appears to be whole. Advertising materials and circulars are typically not part of a policy.&lt;ref name=Porter2007/&gt; Oral contracts pending the issuance of a written policy can occur.&lt;ref name=Porter2007/&gt;

==General features==
The insurance contract or agreement is a contract whereby the insurer promises to pay benefits to the insured or on their behalf to a third party if certain defined events occur. Subject to the "fortuity principle", the event must be uncertain. The uncertainty can be either as to when the event will happen (e.g. in a life insurance policy, the time of the insured's death is uncertain) or as to if it will happen at all (e.g. in a fire insurance policy, whether or not a fire will occur at all).&lt;ref name=" Mowbray54"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mowbray|first1=Albert H.|last2=Blanchard|first2=Ralph H.|title=Insurance: Its Theory and Practice in the United States|date=1961|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|page=54|edition=5th}} Available through [[HeinOnline]].&lt;/ref&gt;

* Insurance contracts are generally considered [[standard form contract|contracts of adhesion]] because the insurer draws up the contract and the insured has little or no ability to make material changes to it.  This is interpreted to mean that the insurer bears the burden if there is any ambiguity in any terms of the contract. Insurance policies are sold without the policyholder even seeing a copy of the contract.&lt;ref name=Wollner1999/&gt;{{rp|27}} In 1970 [[Robert Keeton]] suggested that many courts were actually applying 'reasonable expectations' rather than interpreting ambiguities, which he called the 'reasonable expectations doctrine'. This doctrine has been controversial, with some courts adopting it and others explicitly rejecting it.&lt;ref&gt;Rahdert MC. (1998). [http://insurancejournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/522.pdf Reasonable Expectations Revisited]. ''Conn. Ins. Law Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In several jurisdictions, including California, Wyoming, and Pennsylvania, the insured is bound by clear and conspicuous terms in the contract even if the evidence suggests that the insured did not read or understand them.&lt;ref&gt;''Hadland v. NN Investors Life Ins. Co''., [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/CA4/24CA4t1578.htm 24 Cal. App. 4th 1578] (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. v.

* Insurance contracts are '''aleatory''' in that the amounts exchanged by the insured and insurer are unequal and depend upon uncertain future events.&lt;ref name="Mowbray53"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mowbray|first1=Albert H.|last2=Blanchard|first2=Ralph H.|title=Insurance: Its Theory and Practice in the United States|date=1961|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|page=53|edition=5th}} Available through [[HeinOnline]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clore"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clore|first1=Duncan L.|title=Financial Institution Bonds|date=1998|publisher=American Bar Association|location=Chicago|isbn=9781570736209|page=431|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cZ2lC3L38hcC&amp;pg=PA431}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, ordinary non-insurance contracts are commutative in that the amounts (or values) exchanged are usually intended by the parties to be roughly equal.&lt;ref name="Mowbray53" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clore" /&gt; This distinction is particularly important in the context of exotic products like [[finite risk insurance]] which contain "commutation" provisions.
* Insurance contracts are '''unilateral''', meaning that only the insurer makes legally enforceable promises in the contract.  The insured is not required to pay the premiums, but the insurer is required to pay the benefits under the contract if the insured has paid the premiums and met certain other basic provisions.&lt;ref name="Mowbray69"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mowbray|first1=Albert H.|last2=Blanchard|first2=Ralph H.|title=Insurance: Its Theory and Practice in the United States|date=1961|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|page=69|edition=5th}} Available through [[HeinOnline]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Insurance contracts are governed by the principle of '''utmost good faith''' ([[uberrima fides]]) which requires both parties of the insurance contract to deal in good faith and in particular it imparts on the insured a duty to disclose all material facts which relate to the risk to be covered.&lt;ref name="Mowbray61"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mowbray|first1=Albert H.|last2=Blanchard|first2=Ralph H.|title=Insurance: Its Theory and Practice in the United States|date=1961|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|page=61|edition=5th}} Available through [[HeinOnline]].&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with the legal doctrine that covers most other types of contracts, [[caveat emptor]] (let the buyer beware).  In the [[United States]], the insured can sue an insurer in [[tort]] for acting in [[insurance bad faith|bad faith]].

==Structure==

Insurance contracts were traditionally written on the basis of every single type of risk (where risks were defined extremely narrowly), and a separate premium was calculated and charged for each. Only those individual risks expressly described or "scheduled" in the policy were covered; hence, those policies are now described as "individual" or "schedule" policies.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Eugene R.|last2=Stanzler|first2=Jordan S.|last3=Masters|first3=Lorelie S.|title=Insurance Coverage Litigation|date=2013|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|location=New York|isbn=9780735511736|page=1-31|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2PcKmPjcQTIC&amp;pg=SA1-PA31|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system of "named perils"&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10521634281876024055 Corban v. United Services Auto. Ass'n]'', 20 So.3d 601 (Miss. 2009) (analyzing "named perils" coverage).&lt;/ref&gt; or "specific perils"&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10518192893149844219 Vision One v. Philadelphia Indem. Ins. Co.]'', 174 Wash. 2d 501, 276 P.3d 300 (2012) (analyzing "named perils" and "specific perils" coverage).&lt;/ref&gt; coverage proved to be unsustainable in the context of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]], in that a typical large [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] might have dozens of types of risks to insure against. For example, in 1926, an insurance industry spokesman noted that a bakery would have to buy a separate policy for each of the following risks: manufacturing operations, elevators, [[teamster]]s, product liability, contractual liability (for a spur track connecting the bakery to a nearby railroad), premises liability (for a retail store), and owners' protective liability (for negligence of contractors hired to make any building modifications).&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt;

In 1941, the insurance industry began to shift to the current system where covered risks are initially defined broadly in an "all risk"&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6962614039948217401 Intermetal Mexicana v. Insurance Co. of North America]'', 866 F.2d 71 (3d Cir. 1989) (analyzing "all risks" coverage).&lt;/ref&gt; or "all sums"&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10148034652307303525 JH France Refractories Co. v. Allstate Ins. Co.]'', 626 A.2d 502, 534 Pa. 29 (1993) (analyzing "all sums" coverage).&lt;/ref&gt; insuring agreement on a general policy form (e.g., "We will pay all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages..."), then narrowed down by subsequent exclusion clauses (e.g., "This insurance does not apply to...").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stempel|first1=Jeffrey W.|title=Stempel on Insurance Contracts|date=2007|publisher=Aspen Publishers|location=New York|isbn=0735554366|pages=2-113—2-116|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the insured desires coverage for a risk taken out by an exclusion on the standard form, the insured can sometimes pay an additional premium for an endorsement to the policy that overrides the exclusion.

Insurers have been criticized in some quarters for the development of complex policies with layers of interactions between coverage clauses, conditions, exclusions, and exceptions to exclusions. In a case interpreting one ancestor of the modern "products-completed operations hazard" clause,&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=824319478082890975 Baker v. National Interstate Ins. Co.]'' 180 Cal. App. 4th 1319, 103 Cal. Rptr. 3d 565 (2009). This case explains how the modern clause more clearly excludes both the "products" and "completed operations" hazards as separate things (i.e., each hazard is separately excluded), as opposed to the prior version which was held to apply only when ''both'' hazards were present.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of California]] complained: 
{{cquote|The instant case presents yet another illustration of the dangers of the present complex structuring of insurance policies. Unfortunately the insurance industry has become addicted to the practice of building into policies one condition or exception upon another in the shape of a linguistic [[Tower of Babel]]. We join other courts in decrying a trend which both plunges the insured into a state of uncertainty and burdens the judiciary with the task of resolving it. We reiterate our plea for clarity and simplicity in policies that fulfill so important a public service. &lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5651962945453831529 Insurance Co. of North America v. Electronic Purification Co.]'', 67 Cal. 2d 679, 63 Cal. Rptr. 382, 433 P.2d 174 (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Parts of an insurance contract==
* Declarations - identifies who is an insured, the insured's address, the insuring company, what risks or property are covered, the policy limits (amount of insurance), any applicable deductibles, the policy period and premium amount.&lt;ref name="Mowbray73"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mowbray|first1=Albert H.|last2=Blanchard|first2=Ralph H.|title=Insurance: Its Theory and Practice in the United States|date=1961|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|page=73|edition=5th}} Available through [[HeinOnline]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mathias, Jr.|first1=John H.|last2=Shugrue|first2=John D.|last3=Thomas A.|first3=Marrinson|last4=Daniel J.|first4=Struck|title=Insurance Coverage Disputes|date=2006|publisher=Law Journal Press|location=New York|isbn=1588520757|page=1-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pm8l1HSp0b8C&amp;pg=SA1-PA2|accessdate=8 March 2017|chapter=§ 1.01, Components of an Insurance Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are usually provided on a form that is filled out by the insurer based on the insured's application and attached on top of or inserted within the first few pages of the policy.   
* Definitions - Defines important terms used in the rest of the policy.&lt;ref name="Mathias16"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mathias, Jr.|first1=John H.|last2=Shugrue|first2=John D.|last3=Thomas A.|first3=Marrinson|last4=Daniel J.|first4=Struck|title=Insurance Coverage Disputes|date=2006|publisher=Law Journal Press|location=New York|isbn=1588520757|page=1-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pm8l1HSp0b8C&amp;pg=SA1-PA6|accessdate=8 March 2017|chapter=§ 1.01, Components of an Insurance Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Insuring agreement - Describes the covered perils, or risks assumed, or nature of coverage.  This is where the insurance company makes one or more express promises to [[Indemnity|indemnify]] the insured.&lt;ref name="Mowbray72"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mowbray|first1=Albert H.|last2=Blanchard|first2=Ralph H.|title=Insurance: Its Theory and Practice in the United States|date=1961|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|page=72|edition=5th}} Available through [[HeinOnline]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mathias, Jr.|first1=John H.|last2=Shugrue|first2=John D.|last3=Thomas A.|first3=Marrinson|last4=Daniel J.|first4=Struck|title=Insurance Coverage Disputes|date=2006|publisher=Law Journal Press|location=New York|isbn=1588520757|page=1-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pm8l1HSp0b8C&amp;pg=SA1-PA5|accessdate=8 March 2017|chapter=§ 1.01, Components of an Insurance Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Exclusions - Takes coverage away from the insuring agreement by describing property, perils, hazards or losses arising from specific causes which are not covered by the policy.
* Conditions - These are specific provisions, rules of conduct, duties, and obligations which the insured must comply with in order for coverage to incept, or must remain in compliance with in order to keep coverage in effect. If policy conditions are not met, the insurer can deny the claim.&lt;ref name="Mowbray7374"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mowbray|first1=Albert H.|last2=Blanchard|first2=Ralph H.|title=Insurance: Its Theory and Practice in the United States|date=1961|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=73-74|edition=5th}} Available through [[HeinOnline]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mathias16" /&gt;
* Policy form - The definitions, insuring agreement, exclusions, and conditions are typically combined into a single integrated document called a policy form, coverage form, or coverage part.  When multiple coverage forms are packaged into a single policy, the declarations will state as much, and then there may be additional declarations specific to each coverage form.  Traditionally, policy forms have been so rigidly standardized that they have no blank spaces to be filled in.  Instead, they always expressly refer to terms or amounts stated in the declarations.  If the policy needs to be customized beyond what is possible with the declarations, then the underwriter attaches endorsements or riders. 
* Endorsements - Additional forms attached to the policy that modify it in some way, either unconditionally or upon the existence of some condition.&lt;ref name="Mowbray65"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mowbray|first1=Albert H.|last2=Blanchard|first2=Ralph H.|title=Insurance: Its Theory and Practice in the United States|date=1961|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|page=65|edition=5th}} Available through [[HeinOnline]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mathias, Jr.|first1=John H.|last2=Shugrue|first2=John D.|last3=Thomas A.|first3=Marrinson|last4=Daniel J.|first4=Struck|title=Insurance Coverage Disputes|date=2006|publisher=Law Journal Press|location=New York|isbn=1588520757|page=1-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pm8l1HSp0b8C&amp;pg=SA1-PA7|accessdate=8 March 2017|chapter=§ 1.01, Components of an Insurance Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Endorsements can make policies difficult to read for nonlawyers; they may revise, expand, or delete clauses located many pages earlier in one or more coverage forms, or even modify each other.  Because it is very risky to allow nonlawyer underwriters to directly rewrite policy forms with word processors, insurers usually direct underwriters to modify them by attaching endorsements preapproved by counsel for various common modifications.  
* Riders - A rider is used to convey the terms of a policy amendment and the amendment thereby becomes part of the policy.  Riders are dated and numbered so that both insurer and policyholder can determine provisions and the benefit level.  Common riders to group medical plans involve name changes, change to eligible classes of employees, change in level of benefits, or the addition of a managed care arrangement such as a Health Maintenance Organization or [[Preferred Provider Organization]] (PPO).&lt;ref&gt;"Pricing Medical Expense Insurance," in Medical Expense Insurance, (Washington: The Health Insurance Association of America, 1997), 89.&lt;/ref&gt;   
* Jackets - The term has several distinct and confusing meanings.  In general, it refers to some set of standard [[Boilerplate (text)|boilerplate]] provisions which accompanies all policies at the time of delivery. Some insurers refer to a package of standard documents shared across an entire family of policies as a "jacket." Some insurers extend this to include policy forms, so that the only parts of the policy not part of the jacket are the declarations, endorsements, and riders.  Other insurers use the term "jacket" in a manner closer to its ordinary meaning: a binder, envelope, or [[presentation folder]] with pockets in which the policy may be delivered, or a cover sheet to which the policy forms are stapled or which is stapled on top of the policy.  The standard boilerplate provisions are then printed on the jacket itself.

==Industry standard forms ==
In the United States, property and casualty insurers typically use similar or even identical language in their standard insurance policies, which are drafted by advisory organizations such as the [[Insurance Services Office]] and the [[American Association of Insurance Services]].&lt;ref name=CRS&gt;[http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RS22639_20070406.pdf Impact of the Abolition of McCarran-Ferguson Antitrust Exemption for the “Business of Insurance”]. CRS.&lt;/ref&gt; This reduces the regulatory burden for insurers as policy forms must be approved by states; it also allows consumers to more readily compare policies, albeit at the expense of consumer choice.&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt; In addition, as policy forms are reviewed by courts, the interpretations become more predictable as courts elaborate upon the interpretation of the same clauses in the same policy forms, rather than different policies from different insurers.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman M. (2006). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=995282 Contra Proferentem: The Allure of Ambiguous Boilerplate]. ''Michigan Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, however, insurers have increasingly modified the standard forms in company-specific ways or declined to adopt changes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.propertycasualty360.com/2013/08/02/policy-issues-iso-program-revisions Policy Issues: ISO Program Revisions]. ''PropertyCasualty360''.&lt;/ref&gt;  to standard forms. For example, a review of [[home insurance]] policies found substantial differences in various provisions.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzc D. (2011). [https://lawreview.uchicago.edu/sites/lawreview.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/78_4/Schwarcz.pdf Reevaluating Standardized Insurance Policies]. ''The University of Chicago Law Review''. See also: [http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/not-all-homeowners-policies-are-alike/?_r=0 Not All Homeowners’ Policies Are Alike]. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas such as [[directors and officers liability insurance]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2013/05/14/291814.htm E&amp;O Insights: Directors &amp; Officers Liability Is Not Your Normal Insurance Product]. ''Insurance Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[umbrella insurance|personal umbrella insurance]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irmi.com/expert/articles/2008/hungelmann02.aspx Time To Standardize Personal Umbrella Insurance Policies]. IRMI.&lt;/ref&gt; there is little industry-wide standardization.

===Manuscript policies and endorsements===

For the vast majority of insurance policies, the only page that is heavily custom-written to the insured's needs is the declarations page.  All other pages are standard forms that refer back to terms defined in the declarations as needed. However, certain types of insurance, such as media insurance, are written as '''manuscript policies''', which are either custom-drafted from scratch or written from a mix of standard and nonstandard forms.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4870106663100984151 Dart Industries, Inc. v. Commercial Union Insurance Co.]'', 28 Cal. 4th 1059, 124 Cal. Rptr. 2d 142, 52 P.3d 79 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mathias, Jr.|first1=John H.|last2=Shugrue|first2=John D.|last3=Thomas A.|first3=Marrinson|last4=Daniel J.|first4=Struck|title=Insurance Coverage Disputes|date=2006|publisher=Law Journal Press|location=New York|isbn=1588520757|page=1-16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pm8l1HSp0b8C&amp;pg=SA1-PA16|accessdate=8 March 2017|chapter=§ 1.03, Types of Insurance Policies}}&lt;/ref&gt; By analogy, policy endorsements which are not written on standard forms or whose language is custom-written to fit the insured's particular circumstances are known as manuscript endorsements.

{{unreferenced|date=August 2013}}

In the [[legal theory]], reception is chiefly defined as ''the transfer of a legal phenomenon 'of a different [[legal culture]]', other area or other period of time 'to a new legal climate'.''&lt;ref name="Marju Luts"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Luts|first1=Marju|title=Jurisprudential Reception as a Field of Study|url=http://www.juridicainternational.eu/?id=12458|website=http://www.juridicainternational.eu|publisher=JURIDICA INTERNATIONAL. LAW REVIEW. UNIVERSITY OF TARTU (1632)|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voluntary reception==
According to Max Rheinstein term "reception" should preferably be preserved to those situations in which legal phenomena of one legal climate are consciously and willingly adopted into another legal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalanthology.ch/globalization/3-contributions/types-of-reception/|title=Types of Reception - The Anthology of Swiss Legal Culture:}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal necessity reception===

Where there is an apparent need for a change of legal system in one culture and another existing culture provides an opportunity to satisfy the need &lt;ref name="Marju Luts"/&gt;

===Legal veneration reception===

Veneration reception is one example which occurs if alien norms, institutes or a whole system is adopted for their venerated position and prestige of cultural background.&lt;ref name="Marju Luts"/&gt;

==Imposed legal  reception==

If a legal phenomenon is imposed upon another nation by force, this is referred to as imposed legal reception, in few instances  under certain  conditions imposed reception may transform into a voluntary process and thus become genuine reception but usually imposed legal phenomenon would not be considered genuine legal  reception.&lt;ref name="Marju Luts"/&gt;

==Legal transplantation==

Is a process whereby a legal phenomenon transfers to another geographic area or culture together with people. A situation where a norm of another legal culture is established in a different legal climate by enacting legislation regardless of its original implementation background may also be interpreted as a mere transplantation of a legal phenomenon. Transplantation also occurs where a legal theory is taken to another geographical area. As in the case of imposed reception or voluntary reception, an original transplantation may become true reception: of course not among the group or nation which is the carrier of transplantation but among the legal culture surrounding it in the new area. The transformation of transplantation into reception is perhaps of greater significance in the history of legal science than it is in [[positive law]].&lt;ref name="Marju Luts"/&gt;

==Methodological and systematic  reception==

in which the spread of ''legal [[Legal doctrine|doctrines]] and [[legal theory|theories]]'' plays an especially important role. It is quite clear that the spread of methods brings about the spread of their conceptual and systematic basis. In this regard, system not only refers to a certain classification of legal material, but an internally consistent and systematic approach to law.&lt;ref name="Marju Luts"/&gt;

=='Doctrine of reception' in common law==

In [[common law]], the ''doctrine of reception'' (properly, ''reception of the common law of England in a colony'') refers to the process in which the [[English law]] becomes applicable to a British [[Crown Colony]], [[protectorate]], or [[protected state]].

In ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (Bk I, ch.4, pp 106–108), Sir [[William Blackstone]] described the doctrine as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Plantations or colonies, in distant countries, are either such where the lands are claimed by right of occupancy only, by finding them [[terra nullius|desert and uncultivated]], and peopling them from the mother-country; or where, when already cultivated, they have been either gained by [[conquest (military)|conquest]], or ceded to us by [[treaty|treaties]]. And both these rights are founded upon the law of nature, or at least upon that of nations. But there is a difference between these two species of colonies, with respect to the laws by which they are bound. For it hath been held, that if an uninhabited country be discovered and planted by English subjects, all the English laws then in being, which are the birthright of every subject, are immediately there in force... But in conquered or ceded countries, that have already laws of their own, the [[List of British monarchs|king]] may indeed alter and change those laws; but, till he does actually change them, the ancient laws of the country remain, unless such as are against the law of God, as in the case of an infidel country.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(Note: the 'infidel country' reference here was mainly intended to prohibit customs considered [[barbaric]] by the British, such as [[cannibalism]], once a territory was colonized, in an age when communications between the British government and her far-flung colonies could take months on end.)

In other words, if an 'uninhabited' territory is colonised by Britain, then the English law automatically applies in this territory from the moment of colonisation; however if the colonised territory has a pre-existing legal system, the native law would apply (effectively a form of [[indirect rule]]) until formally superseded by the English law, through [[Royal Prerogative]] subjected to the [[Westminster Parliament]].

==Hong Kong==
In practice, it could take years or even decades for the native law in a colony to be gradually superseded by the English law. The legal history of [[Hong Kong]] provides an illustration of this point: after the colonization by the British Empire in 1841, the [[Great Qing Legal Code]] remained in force for the local Chinese population. Until the end of the 19th Century, Chinese offenders were still executed by [[decapitation]], whereas the British would be put to death by [[hanging]]. Even deep into the 20th Century and well after the fall of the Qing dynasty in China, Chinese men in Hong Kong could still practice [[polygamy]] by virtue of the Qing Code—a situation that was ended only with the passing of the Marriage Act of 1971.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7069">{{Judicial interpretation}}
'''Legislative history''' includes any of various materials generated in the course of creating [[legislation]], such as committee reports, analysis by legislative counsel, committee hearings, floor debates, and histories of actions taken. Legislative history is used for discovering sources of information about a [[legislative intent|legislature's intent]] in enacting a law, although jurists disagree widely about the extent (if any) to which a statute's legislative history has bearing on the meaning of its text.

==Sweden==
Swedish courts frequently avail themselves of the legislative history ({{lang-sv|förarbeten}}, literally "[[travaux préparatoires]]") in interpreting the law. Valid documents of legislative history are often taken to be [[Statens offentliga utredningar|official government reports]], the bills (''proposition'') presented by the [[Government of Sweden|Government]] before the [[Riksdag]], statements made by the responsible minister at the Government session where the bill was adopted (''regeringssammanträde''), the report on the bill by the relevant Riksdag committee (''utskottsbetänkande''), and statements made by the responsible minister during the debate in the Riksdag.

==United Kingdom==
Prior to 1993, looking into the [[Hansard|Parliamentary records]] to aid interpretation would have been perceived as a breach of [[Parliamentary privilege]]; however the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] ruled in [[Pepper v Hart|&lt;nowiki&gt;Pepper v Hart [1993] AC 593&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] that it could do so in specific circumstances.

==United States==
{{POV-section|date=December 2012}}
Whether and to what extent courts should use legislative history when deciding cases is disputed in the United States. [[Textualists]] reject any use of legislative history, while [[Original intent|intentionalists]] and [[Purposive approach|purposivists]] look to legislative history to determine the legislative intent or the goals of the law, respectively.  Many legal scholars believe consulting legislative history is acceptable only when the text of the law is ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=J.|title=DISSENT, Princeton University Press v. Michigan Document Services, Inc.|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/99_F3d_1381.htm|publisher=US Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit|accessdate=24 May 2014|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge [[Alex Kozinski]] summed up the concerns as follows:

:#The two Houses and the President agree on the text of statutes, not on committee reports or floor statements. To give substantive effect to this [[flotsam and jetsam]] of the legislative process is to short-circuit the constitutional scheme for making law.
:#Collective intent is an oxymoron. Congress is not a thinking entity; it is a group of individuals, each of whom may or may not have an "intent" as to any particular provision of the statute. But to look for congressional intent is to engage in anthropomorphism--to search for something that cannot be found because it does not exist.
:#Even if there were such a thing as congressional intent, and even if it could be divined, it wouldn't matter. What matters is what Congress does, not what it intends to do. So, in our hypothetical case, it matters not that Congress intended to delete section 666 from the crime bill; what matters is what it did, and what it did was to pass the bill with the section included.
:#Even if the other obstacles could be overcome, reliance on legislative history actually makes statutes more difficult to interpret by casting doubt on otherwise clear language. This makes it much more difficult for people to conform their conduct to the law, as no one can tell what the law is until a court has weighed the language, the legislative history, the policy considerations, and other relevant information. This increases litigation costs and undermines the rule of law.
:#Legislative history is often contradictory, giving courts a chance to pick and choose those bits which support the result the judges want to reach. In Judge Leventhal's immortal phrase, consulting legislative history is like "looking over a crowd of people and picking out your friends." n24 This shifts power from the Congress and the President--who, after all, are charged with writing the laws--to unelected judges. The more sources a court can consult in deciding how to interpret a statute, the more likely the interpretation will reflect the policy judgments of the judges and not that of the political branches.
:#Allowing legislative history to do work that should be done by statutory language leads to political unaccountability. Members of Congress who reach an impasse can agree on murky language, then salt the legislative record with clues and hints hoping to shift the process of interpretation their way. Elected officials can thus achieve substantive results without having to take the political responsibility that would come from passing clear-cut statutory language.
:# Shifting important policy judgments to the courts brings the judiciary into disrepute and undermines the notion that judges apply the law objectively. When the public comes to understand that judges are simply unelected, life-tenured bureaucrats dressed in black, making policy decisions just like other government officials, the [[moral authority]] of the courts will be seriously undermined and popular obeisance to the courts' constitutional judgments will be jeopardized.
(A. Kozinski, ''Should Reading Legislative History Be an Impeachable Offense?'',31 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 807 (1998) at 813-814)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3579">{{Politics of Liechtenstein}}

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Liechtenstein]] on 1 July 2012&lt;ref name=DD&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=li012012 Liechtenstein, 1 July 2012: Decreased veto of the Prince] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; concerning limiting the extensive veto powers held by the [[Prince of Liechtenstein]]. The proposals were rejected by 76% of voters.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

==Background==
Prior to the [[Liechtenstein referendums, 2011|2011 referendum]] on abortion, Regent [[Alois, Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein|Alois]] had threatened to veto the change to the law to allow voluntary abortion in the first twelve weeks of pregnancy even if the referendum passed.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=li022011 Liechtenstein, 18 September 2011: deadline solution to abortion] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question was agreed on 9 February, and 1,732 signatures were collected between 29 March and 9 May.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; Of these, 1,726 were declared valid, exceeding the 1,500 required to force a referendum.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; The [[Landtag of Liechtenstein|Landtag]] rejected the law on 23 May by a vote of 18 to 7 and subsequently set the date of the referendum.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

==Proposed changes==
The proposed changes would have modified articles 9, 65, 66 and 112 of the constitution.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; Article 9  stated "Every law requires for its validity the sanction of the Prince", and would have been amended to add "or approval in a referendum." Article 65 would have had the sentence "If the sanction of the Prince is not received within six months, it shall be deemed to be denied" removed.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

==Campaign==
As a result, an initiative called "''Damit deine Stimme zählt''" ("So that your voice counts") was launched to change the [[Constitution of Liechtenstein|constitution]] to prevent the Prince from vetoing legislation approved in referendums.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; To counter the campaign, opponents of the change set up a group called "''Für Gott, Fürst und Vaterland''" ("For God, prince and fatherland").&lt;ref name="G&amp;M"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/liechtenstein-for-god-the-prince-and-the-country/article4384292/ | title=Liechtenstein: ‘For God, the prince and the country’ | work=Glode and Mail | date=July 1, 2012 | accessdate=July 3, 2012 | author=Copley, Caroline | location=Vaduz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Princely family threatened to veto the referendum if it resulted in a vote in favour of removing the veto,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501714_162-57375820/liechtenstein-royals-rejects-plan-to-remove-veto/ Liechtenstein royals rejects plan to remove veto] CBS News, 11 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; whilst [[Alois, Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein|Alois]] threatened to resign if it passed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.ch/3652/20120702/ Liechtenstein votes to keep royal veto] The Local, 2 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maltese nationality law''' is based primarily on the principles of [[Jus sanguinis]], although prior to 1 August 1989 the principle of [[Jus soli]] was the basis of the law.

[[multiple citizenship|Dual citizenship]] was severely restricted under Maltese law from independence in 1964 until 10 February 2000, when all restrictions were removed.  Dual citizenship had been allowed in limited circumstances from 1989, but only for persons born in Malta who met specific residence criteria.

Prior to 21 September 1964, [[Malta]] was a British [[Crown colony]] and Maltese persons held [[History of British nationality law|British nationality]].

==Maltese citizenship at independence (1964) ==
{{British subjects}}
Maltese citizenship was conferred at independence, 21 September 1964, upon persons born in Malta who had a Maltese-born parent.

Persons acquiring Maltese citizenship at independence generally lost their British nationality (''Citizenship of the UK and Colonies'') unless they had ties by way of birth or descent (father or paternal grandfather) to the [[United Kingdom]] itself or a place which remained a colony.

Any ''[[Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies|Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies]] (CUKC)'' connected with Malta who did not acquire Maltese citizenship at independence retained their CUKC status.  Based on their ties with the United Kingdom, they became either British citizens or [[British Overseas citizen]]s on 1 January 1983.  See [[History of British nationality law]]

==Birth in Malta==

The [http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lom&amp;itemid=12466&amp;l=1 Malta Independence Order 1964] provided that any person born in Malta between 21 September 1964 and 31 July 2001 automatically acquired Maltese citizenship at birth.

From 1 August 2001, a person born in Malta only acquires Maltese citizenship at birth if a parent of that person is

* a Maltese citizen; or 
* born in Malta.

==Maltese citizenship by descent==

Persons born outside Malta between 21 September 1964 and 31 July 1989 only acquired Maltese citizenship by descent if the father was:

* a Maltese citizen born in Malta; or
* a Maltese citizen by registration or naturalisation

Women could not pass on their Maltese citizenship unless they were unmarried.

From 1 August 1989, children born outside Malta to Maltese born or naturalised mothers acquired Maltese citizenship by descent automatically.

From 10 February 2000, a person born outside Malta between 21 September 1964 and 31 July 1989 to a Maltese born or naturalised mother may apply for Maltese citizenship by registration.

===Changes to the Maltese Citizenship Act in 2007===
Amendments to the Maltese Citizenship Act, which came into force on 1 August 2007, make it possible for all persons of Maltese descent to obtain Maltese citizenship by registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.maltamedia.com/artman2/publish/govt_politics/article_2905.shtml | title=Citizenship law changes come into effect | publisher=MaltaMedia | date=1 August 2007 | accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person has to provide only documentary evidence such as birth, marriage or death certificates to be registered as a citizen. This documentation must show direct descent from an ancestor born in Malta of a parent who was also born in Malta. If a person has parents, grandparents, etc. who are alive and are direct descendants themselves, they will also have to make applications (direct line cannot be broken).

The registration procedure may take place at any Maltese Embassy, High Commission, Consulate or at the Department for Citizenship and Expatriate Affairs in Malta. Residence in Malta is not required.

==Naturalisation as a Maltese citizen==

Prior to 1 August 1989, the residence period for naturalisation was 6 years (5 years for citizens of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries). This period is now 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lom&amp;itemid=8702&amp;l=1 Art. 10(1) of the Maltese Citizenship Act&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the reforms of 2000, persons acquiring Maltese citizenship by naturalisation or registration are no longer obliged to prove they had lost or renounced any other citizenship they held. The same reforms also allowed all former citizens of Malta (who were not automatically given Maltese citizenship back) to re-acquire Maltese citizenship by registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.mt/Library/Cit/CEA3-NAT.pdf |title=ACQUISITION OF MALTESE CITIZENSHIP BY NATURALISATION |publisher=DEPARTMENT FOR CITIZENSHIP &amp; EXPATRIATE AFFAIRS |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes to the Maltese Citizenship Act in 2013 in view of Malta Individual Investor Programme===

Act XV of 2013 introduced amendments to the main act and made it possible for the Minister responsible for citizenship to assign citizenship by naturalisation to a person and his or her dependants who are contributors to the [[Immigrant investor programs|Malta Individual Investor Programme]] (MIIP), a [[Economic citizenship|citizenship-by-investment program]] designed and implemented by [[Henley &amp; Partners]], a global citizenship advisory firm, together with the [[Government of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2016-05-12/local-news/Malta-s-citizenship-scheme-ranks-number-one-in-Henley-Partners-report-6736157746|title=Malta's citizenship scheme ranks number one in Henley &amp; Partners report - The Malta Independent|website=www.independent.com.mt|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendments also provided for the establishment of the post of a Regulator and a Monitoring Committee (composed of the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition and Minister responsible for citizenship) of the MIIP. The amendment also made it an offence to advertise, publish or disseminate the programme without authorisation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parlament.mt/file.aspx?f=44746&lt;/ref&gt; The Government said that it would be accepting applications for a contribution of €650,000 (€25,000 for spouses and dependants) to the National Development and Social Fund. Other investment criteria include an investment into government authorised stocks or bonds for a minimum of €150,000 and a minimum term of five years. Applicants must also commit to either purchasing a residential property valued at more than €350,000 or the leasing of a property, with a minimum annual rent of €16,000 for a minimum period of five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citizenship.com.mt/|title=Malta Citizenship|website=Malta Citizenship|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Residence and Citizenship Handbook|last=Kalin|first=Christian H.|publisher=Ideos Publications|year=2015|isbn=978-0992781859|location=|pages=469–478|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme was roundly criticised, both in Malta and abroad&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euractiv.com/justice/maltese-eu-citizenship-sale-ange-news-532846&lt;/ref&gt;
, as a sale of citizenship, made attractive due to Malta's being an EU member state and a member of the [[Schengen Area]]. In view of the criticism, Government said it would remove one of the most controversial changes brought by the new law, of ending publication of names of new citizens by naturalisation. The provision will be re-enacted and no applications would be accepted before the change is made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/en/newsdetails/news/budget2014/No-golden-passports-before-secrecy-clause-is-removed-Louis-Grech-20131118|title='No golden passports before secrecy clause is removed' – Louis Grech|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maltese citizenship by marriage==
The foreign spouse of a Maltese citizen may acquire Maltese citizenship by marriage after 5 years of marriage and living together. Residence in Malta is not required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.maltaimmigration.com/marriage.php | title=Maltese Citizenship through Marriage | publisher=MaltaImmigration.com | accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Widows and widowers of a Maltese citizen (where the spouse died within the first 5 years of marriage) may apply for Maltese citizenship by marriage 5 years after the date of the marriage to their deceased spouse.
* Persons separated from a Maltese spouse may still apply for Maltese citizenship by marriage provided they lived together for 5 years after the celebration of the marriage.
* Prior to 10 February 2000, the 5-year period of marriage did not apply, while before 1 August 1989 only the foreign wife of a Maltese man was eligible for citizenship by marriage

==Maltese citizenship by adoption==

Prior to 1 January 1977 a person adopted by Maltese citizens normally acquired Maltese citizenship automatically.  The facility to acquire Maltese citizenship by adoption was removed on that date.

From 1 August 1989, a child adopted by Maltese citizens acquires Maltese citizenship automatically provided the child is under the age of 10 at the date of the adoption.

==Loss of Maltese citizenship==

===1964 to 1989===

At independence in 1964, Malta adopted strict rules to prevent [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] in adulthood.

* an adult citizen of Malta acquiring a foreign citizenship automatically lost Maltese citizenship
* a Maltese citizen who had acquired another citizenship at birth or during childhood was obliged to renounce that other citizenship before age 19.   Otherwise, Maltese citizenship was lost.

===Reforms of 1989===

From 1 August 1989 Maltese law was amended to allow certain emigrants from Malta to retain Maltese citizenship.  It was necessary to have been born in Malta and meet certain residential criteria in order to benefit from this provision.

Those covered by this limited exception were deemed ''never'' to have lost Maltese citizenship.  In other words, the change in the law was retrospective to 21 September 1964.

The reform did not assist Maltese citizens by descent who had been born in other countries (such as Australia or Canada) who were still obliged to renounce their other citizenship by age 19 or face automatic loss of Maltese citizenship.

For example, between 1964 and 2000 (when the law changed), approximately 2000 Australian born young persons (aged 18) renounced their [[Australian nationality law|Australian citizenship]] in order to retain Maltese citizenship.  They were generally unable to recover their Australian citizenship later on, or migrate back to Australia.  [http://www.southern-cross-group.org/malta/overview.html Details]

===Reforms of 2000===

From 10 February 2000, it was no longer possible to involuntarily lose Maltese citizenship based on possession or acquisition of a foreign citizenship.

A former Maltese citizen by birth or descent who had resided outside Malta for 6 years was automatically conferred with Maltese citizenship retrospective to the date on which they lost it.  In other words, they are deemed ''never'' to have lost Maltese citizenship.

Other former Maltese citizens who do not meet the requirements for automatic re-acquisition of Maltese citizenship are entitled to obtain Maltese citizenship by registration.  This includes former Maltese citizens who acquired that status by naturalisation or registration, and those who resided outside Malta for less than 6 years.

==Dual citizenship==

With effect from 10 February 2000, there are no restrictions under Maltese law on its citizens holding other citizenships. Dual citizens are entitled to hold a Maltese passport.

==Citizenship of the European Union==
Because Malta forms part of the [[European Union]], Maltese citizens are also [[citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] under [[European Union law]] and thus enjoy [[Freedom of movement for workers#Transitional provisions in new member states|rights of free movement]] and [[Malta (European Parliament constituency)|have the right to vote]] in [[Elections in the European Union|elections]] for the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/malta/index_en.htm | title=Malta | publisher=European Union | accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When in a non-EU country where there is no Maltese embassy, Maltese citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.&lt;ref&gt;Article 20(2)(c) of the [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Part Two: Non-Discrimination and Citizenship of the Union#Article 20|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Citizenship_of_the_European_Union#Stated_rights|Rights abroad: Right to consular protection]]: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state). [[Antigua and Barbuda]] (UK), [[Barbados]] (UK), [[Belize]] (UK), [[Central African Republic]] (France), [[Comoros]] (France), [[Gambia]] (UK), [[Guyana]] (UK), [[Liberia]] (Germany), [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] (UK), [[San Marino]] (Italy), [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] (Portugal), [[Solomon Islands]] (UK), [[Timor-Leste]] (Portugal), [[Vanuatu]] (France)&lt;/ref&gt; Maltese citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in [[Treaties of the European Union|Article 21 of the EU Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF |format=PDF|title=Treaty on the Function of the European Union  (consolidated version)|publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commonwealth citizenship==

As a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] member, citizens of Malta are [[Commonwealth citizen]]s and hence have certain rights in the [[United Kingdom]]:
* access to the [[UK Ancestry Entry Clearance]] (no longer relevant since Malta joined the European Union)
* access to the UK Working Holiday Visa scheme (no longer relevant to Maltese citizens)
* entitlement to UK [[Right of abode]] for Maltese citizens born before 1983 with British born mothers.  This offers  effectively full citizenship rights in the UK (with a simpler route to naturalisation) compared to the standard arrangements for citizens of other EU/EEA member states in the UK.
* full rights to vote and stand for public office in the United Kingdom.
* the option of joining [[Her Majesty's Armed Forces]].

==Travel freedom of Maltese citizens==

{{Main article|Visa requirements for Maltese citizens}}As of May 2018, Maltese citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to [[Visa requirements for Maltese citizens|182 countries and territories]], ranking the Maltese passport 7th in the world (tied with the passports of the [[Czech Republic]] and [[New Zealand]]) according to the [[Henley_%26_Partners_Passport_Index#2018|Visa Restrictions Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Ranking - Visa Restriction Index 2018|url=https://www.henleyglobal.com/files/download/HPI2018/PI%202018%20INFOGRAPHS%20GLOBAL%20180518.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Visa requirements for Maltese citizens.png|330px|thumb|[[Visa requirements for Maltese citizens]]]]
Visa requirements for Maltese citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of [[Malta]].

In 2017, the Maltese nationality is ranked twenty-third in the [[The Quality of Nationality Index|Nationality Index]] (QNI). This index differs from the [[Visa (document)#Visa restrictions|Visa Restrictions Index]], which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition to travel freedom, on internal factors such as peace &amp; stability, economic strength, and human development as well. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.businessinsider.de/nationalities-with-the-best-quality-of-life-2016-6?r=UK&amp;IR=T |title= The 41 nationalities with the best quality of life |date= 2016-02-06 |website=  www.businessinsider.de |access-date= 2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mandamus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|n|'|d|eɪ|m|ə|s}}; [[Latin]] "we command") is a judicial remedy in the form of an order from a court&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexwarrier.org/writ-of-mandamus-and-indian-constitution.html Writ of Mandamus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150819205457/http://www.lexwarrier.org/writ-of-mandamus-and-indian-constitution.html |date=2015-08-19 }}, and Indian Constitution.&lt;/ref&gt; to any government, subordinate court, [[corporation]], or [[public authority]], to do (or forbear from doing) some specific act which that body is obliged under law to do (or refrain from doing), and which is in the nature of public duty, and in certain cases one of a statutory duty. It cannot be issued to compel an authority to do something against statutory provision. For example, it cannot be used to force a lower court to reject or authorize applications that have been made, but if the court refuses to rule one way or the other then a mandamus can be used to order the court to rule on the applications.

Mandamus may be a command to do an administrative action or not to take a particular action, and it is supplemented by [[legal right]]s. In the [[United States|American]] legal system it must be a judicially enforceable and legally protected right before one suffering a grievance can ask for a mandamus. A person can be said to be aggrieved only when he or she is denied a legal right by someone who has a [[Duty of care|legal duty]] to do something and abstains from doing it.

==Legal requirements==
The party requesting a writ of mandamus to be enforced should be able to show that he or she has a legal right to compel the [[respondent]] to do or refrain from doing the specific act. The duty sought to be enforced must have two qualities:&lt;ref&gt;RK Choudhary's Law of Writs; Mandamus.&lt;/ref&gt; It must be a duty of public nature and the duty must be imperative and should not be [[wikt:discretionary|discretionary]].  Furthermore, mandamus will typically not be granted if adequate relief can be obtained by some other means, such as appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Supreme Court Rule 20 | url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/supct/rule_20 | accessdate = May 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The purpose of mandamus is to remedy defects of justice. It lies in the cases where there is a specific right but no specific legal remedy for enforcing that right. Generally, it is not available in anticipation of any injury except when the petitioner is likely to be affected by an official act in contravention of a statutory duty or where an illegal or unconstitutional order is made. The grant of mandamus is therefore an [[equitable remedy]]; a matter for the discretion of the court, the exercise of which is governed by well-settled principles.&lt;ref&gt;Gangadhar Narsingdas Agrawal v. Union of India, AIR 1967 Goa 142 (147); Regional Director v. AS Bhangoo, (1969) 73 Cal. WN 267; Megh Nath v. Director, Technical Education, UT Chandigarh, 1990 (1) RSJ 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandamus, being a discretionary remedy, the application for that must be made in good faith and not for indirect purposes. Acquiescence cannot, however, bar the issue of mandamus. The petitioner must, of course, satisfy the Court that he or she has the legal right to the performance of the legal duty as distinct from mere discretion of authority.&lt;ref&gt;Basantilal v. Laxminarayan, 1970 MPLJ (Note) 6.&lt;/ref&gt; A mandamus is normally issued when an officer or an authority by compulsion of statute is required to perform a duty and that duty, despite demand in writing, has not been performed. In no other case will a writ of mandamus issue unless it be to quash an illegal order.

==Types==
There are three kinds of mandamus:

#'''Alternative mandamus''': A mandamus issued upon the first application for relief, commanding the defendant either to perform the act demanded or to appear before the court at a specified time to show cause for not performing it.
#'''[[Peremptory writ of mandamus|Peremptory mandamus]]''': An absolute and unqualified command to the defendant to do the act in question. It is issued when the defendant defaults on, or fails to show sufficient cause in answer to, an alternative mandamus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/peremptory+writ+of+mandamus Legal Dictionary].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.mongabay.com/news/peremptory_writ_of_mandate.html Mongabay.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116095205/http://law.mongabay.com/news/Peremptory_Writ_Of_Mandate.html |date=2007-11-16 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''[[Continuing mandamus]]''': A mandamus issued to a lower authority in general public interest asking the officer or the authority to perform its tasks expeditiously for an unstipulated period of time for preventing miscarriage of justice.&lt;ref&gt;Vineet Narain v. Union of India, AIR 1996 SC 3386.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In various countries==

===Parliamentary democracies===

====Australia====
Under the [[Australia|Australian]] legal system, mandamus is available through [[Section 75 of the Constitution of Australia|section 75(v) of the Constitution of Australia]].&lt;ref name="s75"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|coaca430|Constitution of Australia|75}} Original jurisdiction of High Court.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|57|2000|litigants=Re Refugee Tribunal; Ex parte Aala |parallelcite=(2000) 204 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 82 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====England and Wales====
In England and Wales, mandamus was originally known as a '''writ of mandamus''' and more recently as an '''order of mandamus'''. This procedure was renamed by the ''Civil Procedure (Modification of Supreme Court Act 1981) Order 2004'' to become a '''mandatory order'''.

====India====
In India, the ''[[sine qua non]]'' for mandamus is the existence of a statutory public duty incumbent upon the person or body against whom the mandamus is sought. There must equally co-exist a corresponding right in the petitioner entitling him to claim the enforcement of such public duty. These two preconditions form the foundation for the issue of mandamus. The primary scope and function of mandamus is to "command" and "execute" rather than to "enquire" and "adjudicate". It cannot be issued to change the decision of a body so as to suit the petitioner. Obligations which are not of statutory nature cannot be enforced by mandamus.&lt;ref&gt;R.P. Kapoor v. Delhi Development Authority.{{full|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writ petition is not maintainable when a remedy provided for under the [[Code of Civil Procedure]] is available. For example, the High Court cannot entertain writ petitions for mandamus to the Government who fails to deposit and pay in the requisite time an enhanced compensation account as ordered by a lower Court. The petitioners in this case would be directed to approach the executing Court for appropriate relief.&lt;ref&gt;Government of AP v. Puniparthi Narayana Rajiu, 2002 Andhr. LT. 113 at pp. 113-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the Supreme Court and High Courts are empowered to exercise Writ Jurisdiction, under Art. 32 and 226 of Constitution. No other courts are empowered to issue writ.
mandmus:- It means court can ask common people, authorities to do or no to do some task.It does not come against president, governor, parliament, state legislature, private bodies, and individual persons.

===United States===
In the [[administrative law]] context in the [[United States of America|United States]], the requirement that mandamus can be used only to compel a [[ministerial act]] has largely been abandoned. By statute or by judicial expansion of the writ of mandamus in most of the [[U.S. state]]s, acts of [[administrative agency|administrative agencies]] are now subject to [[judicial review]] for [[abuse of discretion]]. Judicial review of agencies of the [[United States federal government]], for abuse of discretion, is authorized by the U.S. [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedures Act]].

====Federal courts====
The authority of the [[United States District Courts|United States district court]]s (trial courts) to issue mandamus has been expressly abrogated by Rule 81(b) of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_81 Fed.R.Civ.P. 81] as amended, December 1, 2014. (b) "The writs of scire facias and mandamus are abolished. Relief previously available through them may be obtained by appropriate action or motion under these rules."&lt;/ref&gt; but relief in the nature of mandamus can be had by other remedies provided for in the Rules, where provided by statute, or by use of the [[United States District Courts|District Court's]] equitable powers.

In the context of ''mandamus'' from a [[United States court of appeals|United States Court of Appeals]] to a [[United States District Courts|United States District Court]], the Supreme Court has ruled that the appellate courts have discretion to issue ''mandamus'' to control an [[abuse of discretion]] by the lower court in unusual circumstances, where there is a compelling reason not to wait for an [[appeal]] from a final [[Judgment (law)|judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cheney v. United States District Court|Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for Dist. of Columbia]], 542 U.S. 367, 390 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; This discretion is exercised very sparingly. It is exercised with somewhat greater frequency, although still sparingly, in the context of [[discovery (law)|discovery]] disputes involving [[privilege (evidence)|privileged materials]], since a [[United States District Courts|district court]] order erroneously forcing the disclosure of privileged material may never be remediable through a later appeal.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} In the case ''[[In Re Electronic Privacy Information Center]]'' (2013), privacy advocates sought a writ of mandamus directly from the Supreme Court to halt the [[National Security Agency]]'s bulk phone record collection program. The Supreme Court denied the petition.  More recently, the Supreme Court sided with the US Government and issued a writ of mandamus related to discovery in a court case involving the rescinding of the [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High Court Sides With Feds on Discovery for DACA Challenge|url=https://www.courthousenews.com/high-court-sides-with-feds-on-discovery-for-daca-challenge/|author=Leonard, Barbara|publisher=Courthouse News|date=December 11, 2017|accessdate=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State courts====
In some [[State court (United States)|state court systems]], ''mandamus'' has evolved into a general procedure for discretionary appeals from non-final trial court decisions. In some [[U.S. state]]s, such as the [[courts of California]], the writ is now called ''mandate'' instead of ''mandamus'', and may be issued by ''any'' level of the state court system to any lower court or to any government official. It is still common for Californians to bring "[[taxpayer standing|taxpayer]] actions" against public officials for wasting public funds through mismanagement of a government agency, where the relief sought is a writ of mandate compelling the official to stop wasting money and fulfill his duty to protect the public fisc.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Humane Society of the United States v. State Bd. of Equalization'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/CA4/152CA4t349.htm 152 Cal. App. 4th 349] (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  The writ of mandate is also used in California for [[interlocutory appeal]]s. In this context, the party seeking the writ is treated on appeal like a plaintiff, the trial court becomes the defendant, and the opponent is designated as the "real party in interest."

In Virginia, the [[Virginia Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] has "[[original jurisdiction]]" under the state constitution for mandamus involving the Virginia courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arielconsult.com/childcustodyVA Child Custody Resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119123611/http://www.arielconsult.com/ChildCustodyVA/ |date=2008-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere, including the [[Courts of New York]], have replaced ''mandamus'' (as well as the other prerogative writs) with statutory procedures. In New York, this is known as an ''Article 78'' review after the [[civil procedure]] law provision that created the relevant procedure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&amp;QUERYDATA=@SLCVP0A78+&amp;LIST=LAW+&amp;BROWSER=EXPLORER+&amp;TOKEN=33594054+&amp;TARGET=VIEW New York Civil Practice Law and Rules article 78] at the New York State Assembly website. Accessed June 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In still other states, such as [[Illinois]], the state court of last resort has [[original jurisdiction]] in mandamus actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilga.gov/commission/lrb/con6.htm Illinois Constitution, Article VI].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Courts of North Carolina|North Carolina state courts]], ''mandamus'' is authorized as one of the Extraordinary Writs, under Rule 22 of the [http://www.aoc.state.nc.us/www/public/html/pdf/therules.pdf North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure]. The writ of mandamus may be issued in instances where, for instance, the lower court fails to timely issue a written order after rendition (thus precluding both the possibility of an appeal or enforcement of the rendition and leaving the litigants in limbo). The [[North Carolina Court of Appeals]] has spoken on the possible course of action in such situations, and confirmed that petitioning for a writ of mandamus is the only available route. McKyer v. McKyer, 202 N.C.App. 771 at *4 (2010) (unpublished)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKyer v. McKyer|title=202 N.C. App. 771|date=March 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In McKyer, the lawyer who was unable to persuade the trial court judge to enter an order for about a year, tried to remedy the problem by asking the trial court judge to hold another hearing. Disapproving of the attempted resolution via a new hearing, the Court of Appeals, citing to the Supreme Court case ''In re T.H.T.''&lt;ref&gt;''In re T.H.T.'' [http://appellate.nccourts.org/opinions/?c=1&amp;pdf=738 362 N.C. 446, 665 S.E.2d 54 (2008)].&lt;/ref&gt;   explained that a party seeking recourse where the trial court has not entered its orders timely should petition for writ of mandamus. Similarly, the writ may issue where the trial court fails or refuses to timely dispose with the litigants' business (for instance, if the judge refuses to hear a case). In North Carolina, as elsewhere, the writ is an action against the official, meaning that the petition must be styled "In RE Public Figure X" or "In RE Judge Y." Thus, a mandamus petition not only brings the strife of optically making the officer or judge the defendant, but also in theory requires the official / judge to respond "within ten days" "with supporting affidavits." Curiously, Rule 22(c) provides that "any party" may respond to the petition for writ. The North Carolina Court of Appeals has interpreted this to mean that where, for instance, one litigant demands that the judge enter a previously rendered order, the other litigant in the same case is free to respond instead of (or in addition to) the judge that presides over both of the litigants.

'''McLaren Transport Ltd v Somerville''' [1996] 3 NZLR 424 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding the awarding of exemplary damages.&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Somerville took a hay conditioner to McLaren transport to get a tyre changed. McLaren's employee Stumbles undertook to change the tyre, although he had little training in changing tyres. As Stumbles was unable to find a 15-inch tyre in  stock, he then proceeded to try an fit a 15 1/2 inch tyre instead. After 3 attempts at inflating the incorrect sized tyre, it finally exploded, injuring Somerville whom was assisting Stumbles with the tyre.

As Somerville was legally  barred from suing McLaren for damages for his injury due to Accident Compensation law, he sued instead for exemplary damages, with the District Court awarding $15,000.

McLaren appealed.

==Held==
The Court ruled that the award for damages was justified.

'''Muḥammad Shafī‘ ibn Muḥammad Yāsīn ‘Us̱mānī Deobandī''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|محمد شفیع بن محمد ياسین عثمانی دیوبندی}}}}; {{lang-ar|محمد شفيع بن محمد ياسين العثماني الديوبندي}}, ''Muḥammad Shafī‘ ibn Muḥammad Yāsīn al-‘Uthmānī ad-Diyūbandī''; {{circa}} 25 January 1897{{spaced ndash}}6 October 1976),{{#tag:ref|ياسين (Yasin) also spelled یٰسین|group="note"}} often referred to as '''Mufti Muhammad Shafi''', was a [[Pakistani]] [[Sunni]] [[Islamic scholar]] of the [[Deobandi]] school of Islamic thought. A [[Hanafi]] [[faqih|jurist]] and [[mufti]], he was also an authority on [[shari'ah]], [[hadith]], ''[[tafsir]]'' (Qur'anic exegesis), and ''[[tasawwuf]]'' (Sufism). Born in [[Deoband]], [[British India]], he graduated in 1917 from [[Darul Uloom Deoband]], where he later taught hadith and held the post of Chief Mufti. He resigned from the school in 1943 to devote his time to the [[Pakistan Movement]]. After the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] he moved to Pakistan, where he established [[Darul Uloom Karachi]] in 1951. Of his written works, his best-known is ''[[Ma'ariful Qur'an]]'', a ''tafsir'' of the [[Qur'an]].

==Birth and early childhood==
Muhammad Shafi, son of Maulana Muhammad Yasin, was born on 21 Sha'ban 1314 [[anno hegirae|AH]] (c. 25 January 1897) in [[Deoband]], [[British India]] (in present-day [[Saharanpur district]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]) to an [[Usmani]] family.&lt;ref name=taqi&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Shafi grew up in a religious environment. As a child he played in the courtyard of Darul Uloom Deoband and sat in the company of his father, who was a teacher at the school.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

==Education==
At about the age of five, Shafi began ''nazirah'' (reading of the [[Qur'an]]) with Hafiz Muhammad Azim at the Darul Uloom.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt; After reading the Qur'an, he did ''[[hifz]]'' (memorization of the Qur'an) with Hafiz Abdul Azim and Hafiz Namdar Khan.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1325 AH (1907/1908) he commenced the study of Urdu, Persian, mathematics and other subjects at Darul Uloom Deoband, which he completed within the next five years under the supervision of his father.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt; He studied arithmetic and Euclid from his uncle Munshi Manzur Ahmad and ''[[tajwid]]'' from Qari Muhammad Yusuf Miruthi. Along with teaching Shafi the Persian books, Maulana Yasin also instructed him in the elementary [[Arabic]] books of ''sarf'' (morphology), ''nahw'' (grammar), and ''[[fiqh]]'' (jurisprudence), up to ''Fusul-i Akbari'', ''Hidayat an-Nahw'', and ''Munyat al-Musalli''.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;

Foremost among his teachers was Anwar Shah Kashmiri, who was the school's Sadr Mudarris (head teacher). Some of the books Shafi studied with him were ''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]'', ''[[Jami' at-Tirmidhi]]'' (with the exception of a small part), [[at-Tirmidhi]]'s ''[[Shama'il Muhammadiyah|Shama'il]]'' and '''Ilal'', ''al-Falsafah al-'Arabiyah'' on modern philosophy, and ''Sharh an-Nafisi'' on medicine (''tibb''). Shafi was among Kashmiri's closest students, and Kashmiri would later select Shafi for assistance in refuting the [[Ahmadiyya Movement]]. Shafi studied ''[[Sahih Muslim]]'' and half of ''[[al-Hidayah (book)|Hidayah]]'' with Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, whom he would later accompany in the movement to create Pakistan. With Maulana Asghar Husain he studied the hadith collections ''[[Sunan Abu Dawud]]'', ''[[Sunan an-Nasa'i]]'', and the remainder of ''Jami' at-Tirmidhi''. With Azizur Rahman, head of the Darul Uloom's [[Fatwa]] Department, Shafi studied the [[Muwatta Imam Malik|Muwatta]] of [[Imam Malik]] in the transmission of [[Yahya al-Laithi|Yahya ibn Yahya]] and the transmission of [[Muhammad al-Shaybani|ash-Shaybani]], [[at-Tahawi]]'s ''Sharh Ma'ani al-Athar'', ''[[Tafsir al-Jalalayn]]'', ''[[Mishkat al-Masabih]]'', [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]]'s ''Sharh Nukhbat al-Fikar'', and ''Hisn-i Hasin''. He studied ''Sunan Ibn Majah'' with Ghulam Rasul Hazarwi. With Izaz Ali he studied all the books of literature, [[Maibazi]]'s ''Sharh Hidayat al-Hikmah'', [[at-Taftazani]]'s ''Sharh al-'Aqa'id al-Nasafiyah'', Ubayd Allah al-Mahbubi's ''Sharh al-Wiqayah'', and some other treatises. With Maulana Muhammad Ibrahim he studied ''[[Mulla Sadra|Sadra]]'' and ''[[Shams al-Bazighah]]''.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;

After Daurah a few books still remained, including ''Qazi'', ''Mir Zahid'', and ''Umur-i 'Ammah''—these were completed in 1336 AH (1917/1918).&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt; In that year Shafi was also appointed to teach some lessons.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt;

==Teaching career==
Maulana Shafi was formally appointed as a teacher in Darul Uloom Deoband in 1337 AH (1918/1919).&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt; He began teaching the elementary level books of the curriculum and eventually reached the level of Daurah Hadith.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt; The first book of Daurah level that he was given was ''[[Muwatta Imam Malik]]'', and he later taught other books. In 1354 AH (1935/1936) he was entrusted with teaching ''[[Sunan Abu Dawud]]'' for some time in place of Maulana Asghar Husain. On Husain's request he was given this lecture permanently, and he taught it until he left Darul Uloom Deoband in 1362 AH (1943). Shafi was regarded as an exceptional lecturer on many subjects, but two of his lessons were most famous—one was ''Sunan Abu Dawud'', and the other was ''Maqamat al-Hariri'' in Arabic literature.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt; After leaving Darul Uloom Deoband, he taught ''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]'' for three months at [[Jamiah Islamiyah Dabhel]], filling in for [[Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani]].&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;

Shafi established [[Darul Uloom Karachi]] in Shawwal 1370 AH (1951). There he taught ''Sahih al-Bukhari'' for several years, as well as ''Muwatta Malik'' and ''[[Shama'il at-Tirmidhi]]''. Whenever due to health or other responsibilities he was unable to teach the whole of ''Bukhari'', then those years he would teach until the Book of Wudu, and other teachers would cover the remainder. In the last four years of his life, he was bedridden and thus unable to teach regularly. However, on the insistence of students and teachers, every year he taught the first lesson of ''Sahih al-Bukhari'' and the last lessons of the [[Sihah Sittah]].&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;

==Issuance of fatawa==
From the beginning of his teaching career Maulana Shafi frequently assisted Mufti Azizur Rahman, then head of the school's [[fatwa]] department.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt; Azizur Rahman resigned from the Darul Uloom in 1344 AH (1925/1926). Others occupied the post of Sadr Mufti (Chief Mufti) until the Majlis-e-Shura of Darul Uloom Deoband appointed Shafi to the post on 28 Rabi al-Awwal 1350 AH (c. 13 August 1931).&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Mufti Muhammad Shafi writes in the introduction to ''Ma'ariful Qur'an'' that he occupied the post from 1349 AH.&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt;|group="note"}} In additions to undertaking the duties of fatwa-writing, Shafi also continued to teach some books of hadith and tafsir.&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt;

In Rajab 1351 (November 1932) Shafi published a tract entitled ''Nihayat al-arab fi ghayat an-nasab'' on [[Caste system among Muslims#In South Asia|caste]]. The weavers of the Deoband area (who were regarded as a lower caste) revolted against the fatwa, and from early 1353 AH (1934/1935) to late 1354 AH (1935/1936) rallies were held and threats were made against Shafi, in response to which a group of teachers took to acting as his bodyguards. Several scholars wrote or spoke in defense of the fatwa, including Shafi's shaikh Ashraf Ali Thanawi, Sayyid Asghar Husain, and Husain Ahmad Madani. Due to the controversy, Shafi asked to be transferred to the teaching department, a request that was eventually granted by the Majlis-e-Shura in Sha'ban 1354 AH (c. November 1935).&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buehler|first=Arthur F.|title=Sayyids and Sharifs in Muslim Societies: The Living Links to the Prophet|editor-last=Morimoto|editor-first=Kazuo|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780203123157|page=239|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5VnmEMh0MF4C&amp;pg=PA239|chapter=Trends of ashrāfization in India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shafi remained in the teaching department over the next few years, during which two other ulama held the post of Sadr Mufti. On 25 Safar 1359 AH (c. 4 April 1940), Shafi was appointed to the office a second time.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt; He held the post until he left Darul Uloom Deoband in Rabi al-Awwal 1362 AH (March 1943).&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Rizvi writes that Shafi occupied the post until 1361 AH (1942).&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt;|group="note"}}

Estimates of the number of fatwas that he issued while at Darul Uloom Deoband range from 26,000&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt; to over 40,000. Some of Muhammad Shafi's fatwas have been published in eight large volumes titled ''Imdad al-Muftin'', while the majority remain unpublished.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;

==Sufism==
From an early age, Shafi frequently attended the gatherings of [[Maulana Mahmud Hasan]]. Then when Mahmud Hasan was [[Malta exiles|imprisoned in Malta]], Shafi consulted [[Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanawi]]. Mahmud Hasan returned to Deoband on 20 Ramadan 1338 AH (June 1920). In 1339 AH (1920) Shafi gave ''bay'at'' (allegiance) at his hand. However, Mahmud Hasan died a few months later on 18 Rabi al-awwal AH (November 1920). Shafi returned to Thanawi after Mahmud Hasan's death. In Rabi ath-thani 1349 AH (1930) he received ''ijazat-i bay'at'' (permission to take disciples) and ''khilafah'' (spiritual successorship).&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;

==Pakistan Movement==
At the time Muhammad Shafi was teaching at Darul Uloom Deoband, Indians were struggling for independence from the British. When the [[All-India Muslim League]] was formed to campaign for the creation of a separate Muslim state, [[Ashraf Ali Thanvi]] instructed all ''[[ulama]]'' and Muslims in general to support this campaign. Muhammad Shafi, with other scholars including Zafar Ahmad Usmani, joined the [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]], a council of Islamic scholars formed by [[Shabbir Ahmad Usmani]] to campaign for the creation of Pakistan. In 1363 AH (1944) Muhammad Shafi resigned from teaching and issuing fatwas at Darul Uloom Deoband in order to devote his time to the movement for the creation of Pakistan. He toured India, gave speeches, and issued ''fatwas'' for this purpose.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;

==Migration to Pakistan==
After [[Pakistan Movement|independence]], in 1367 AH (1948), Muhammad Shafi left his hometown of Deoband and immigrated to Pakistan. He founded [[Darul Uloom Karachi]] in 1370 AH (1950/1951). Muhammad Shafi died on 10 Shawwal 1396 (6 October 1976).&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;

==Works==
He wrote around one hundred books [[Exegesis#Islam|explaining]] the [[Quran]] and interpreting [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. His best-known and most widely translated work is the ''[[Ma'ariful Qur'an]]'' ("The Wisdom of the Quran"), which he finished (in Urdu) four years before his death.&lt;ref name="ibid"&gt;''Ma'ariful Qur'an: A Comprehensive Commentary on the Holy Qur'an'' (Karachi: Mataba-e-Darul-Ulomm Karachi, 2008 ed.), Volume 1. p. xv&lt;/ref&gt; This work, a commentary on the entire Quran, began as a series of weekly lectures on [[Radio Pakistan]] that ran for ten years.&lt;ref name="ibid" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="82793">[[Net neutrality]] is the principle that governments should mandate [[Internet service provider]]s  to treat all data on the [[Internet]] the same, and not discriminate or charge differently by user, content, website, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or method of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | first=Angele A. | last=Gilroy | title=Access to Broadband Networks: The Net Neutrality Debate | page=1 | publisher=DIANE Publishing | isbn=978-1437984545 | date=March 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, under these principles, internet service providers are unable to  intentionally block, slow down or charge money for specific websites and online content.

==By country==

=== Argentina ===
The Law 27,078, of 2014, under the Article 56 establishes the right of users to access, use, send, receive or offer any content, application, service or protocol through the Internet without any restriction, discrimination, distinction or blocking. Article 57 forbids “ICT service providers” from blocking, interfering, or restricting any content, application, service, or protocol; price discrimination by virtue of its contents. Article 57 also establishes an exception allowing blocking or restrictions solely under a judicial order or by the user of the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://servicios.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/235000-239999/239771/norma.htm|title=Law 27,078|publisher=InfoLEG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
In Belgium, net neutrality was discussed in the [[Kamer van Volksvertegenwoordigers|parliament]] in June 2011. Three parties ([[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|CD&amp;V]], [[Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie|N-VA]] &amp; [[Parti Socialiste (België)|PS]]) jointly proposed a text to introduce the concept of net neutrality in the telecom law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dekamer.be/FLWB/PDF/53/1467/53K1467002.pdf proposition 53 1467/002] dekamer.be, 27 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
{{main |Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet}}
In 2014, the Brazilian government passed a law which expressly upholds net neutrality, "guaranteeing equal access to the Internet and protecting the privacy of its users in the wake of U.S. spying revelations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/3/26/brazil-internet-constitution.html|title=Net neutrality wins in Brazil’s ‘Internet Constitution’ - Al Jazeera America|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet (in {{lang-pt|Marco Civil da Internet}}, officially Law No 12.965) became law on April 23, 2014 at the [[Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance]]. It governs the use of the [[Internet in Brazil]], through forecasting principles, guarantees, rights and duties to those who use the network as well as the determination of guidelines for state action. The legislation was used as basis to block the popular [[WhatsApp]] application in Brazilian territory, a decision lifted soon afterwards, experts claiming that it was, in actuality, against the Framework, which was misinterpreted by the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tjsp.jus.br/institucional/canaiscomunicacao/noticias/Noticia.aspx?Id=29056 "São Paulo Court of Justice - Justiça determina bloqueio do aplicativo WhatsApp"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220074410/http://www.tjsp.jus.br/Institucional/CanaisComunicacao/Noticias/Noticia.aspx?Id=29056 |date=20 December 2015 }}, Comunicação Social TJSP, São Paulo Court of Justice, 16 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/brazil-passes-groundbreaking-internet-governance-bill-7000027740/ "Brazil passes groundbreaking Internet governance Bill"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025092023/http://www.zdnet.com/brazil-passes-groundbreaking-internet-governance-bill-7000027740/ |date=25 October 2014 }}, Angelica Mari, ZDNet, 26 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://direitorio.fgv.br/noticia/the-brazilian-civil-rights-framework-for-the-internet "The Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514083732/http://direitorio.fgv.br/noticia/the-brazilian-civil-rights-framework-for-the-internet |date=14 May 2015 }}, Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV), 9 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techtudo.com.br/noticias/noticia/2015/12/bloqueio-do-whatsapp-fere-o-marco-civil-da-internet-veja-posicao-do-cgi.html|title=Bloqueio do WhatsApp fere o Marco Civil da Internet?

{{main |Net neutrality in Canada}}

In a January 25, 2011 decision, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) ruled that usage-based billing could be introduced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2011/2011-44.htm "Telecom Decision CRTC 2011-44"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316224937/http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2011/2011-44.htm |date=16 March 2015 }}, Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), File number: 8661-C12-201015975, 25 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister Harper signaled that the government may be looking into the ruling: "We're very concerned about CRTC's decision on usage-based billing and its impact on consumers. I've asked for a review of the decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/tech-news/pm-orders-review-of-internet-billing/article1890567/ |location=Toronto |work=The Globe and Mail |first1=Steven |last1=Chase |first2=Iain |last2=Marlow |title=Harper steps into Web dispute - The Globe and Mail |date=2011-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202070354/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/tech-news/pm-orders-review-of-internet-billing/article1890567/ |archivedate=2 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have suggested that the ruling adversely affects net neutrality, since it discriminates against media that is larger in size, such as audio and video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pinto |first=Lindsey |title=What does Usage-Based Billing mean for Net Neutrality? |url=http://www.saveournet.ca/content/what-does-usage-based-billing-mean-net-neutrality |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114061549/http://saveournet.ca/content/what-does-usage-based-billing-mean-net-neutrality |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 November 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
{{Main|Net neutrality in Chile}}
On 13 June 2010, the [[National Congress of Chile]] amended the country's telecommunications law in order to preserve network neutrality, becoming the first country in the world to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/23/netherlands-enshrines-net-neutrality-law |title=Net neutrality enshrined in Dutch law |work=The Guardian |date=23 June 2011 |accessdate=23 June 2011 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930112646/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/23/netherlands-enshrines-net-neutrality-law |archivedate=30 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/08/27/navegante/1282907501.html |title=Chile publica su ley que garantiza la neutralidad de la Red &amp;#124; Navegante |work=El Mundo |location=Spain |accessdate=23 June 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821192544/http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/08/27/navegante/1282907501.html |archivedate=21 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/Quien/quiere/acabar/neutralidad/Red/elpepisoc/20100809elpepisoc_1/Tes |title=¿Quién quiere acabar con la neutralidad en la Red? |work=EL PAÍS |accessdate=14 September 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124134810/http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/Quien/quiere/acabar/neutralidad/Red/elpepisoc/20100809elpepisoc_1/Tes |archivedate=24 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This came after an intensive campaign on [[blog]]s, [[Twitter]], and other social networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/Quien/quiere/acabar/neutralidad/Red/elpepisoc/20100809elpepisoc_1/Tes|title=¿Quién quiere acabar con la neutralidad en la Red?|work=EL PAÍS|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law, published on 26 August 2010, added three articles to the General Law of Telecommunications, forbidding ISPs from arbitrarily blocking, interfering with, discriminating, hindering or restricting an Internet user's right to use, send, receive or offer any legal content, application, service or any other type of legal activity or use through the Internet. ISPs must offer Internet access in which content is not arbitrarily treated differently based on its source or ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idLey=20453|title=Law 20,453|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816104919/http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idLey=20453|archivedate=16 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
The [[China|People's Republic of China’s]] approach to internet policy does not account for Net Neutrality as the government uses ISPs to inspect and regulate the content that is available to their citizens. They typically block both foreign and domestic sites that the government wishes to censor in their country, using software and hardware that together are known as the "[[Great Firewall]]." Many of the sites that are on the Great Firewall’s blacklist are there because they provide information that the government cannot effectively alter permanently, such as large social media IPs or information sites such as Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hu|first=Henry L.|date=2011|title=The Political Economy of Governing ISPs in China: Perspectives of Net Neutrality and Vertical Integration|jstor=41305255|journal=The China Quarterly|issue=207|pages=523–540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thomas Lum, a specialist in Asian Affairs: "Since its founding in 1949, the People's Republic of China (PRC) has exerted great effort in manipulating the flow of information and prohibiting the dissemination of viewpoints that criticize the government or stray from the official Communist party view. The introduction of Internet technology in the mid-1990s presented a challenge to government control over news sources, and by extension, over public opinion. While the Internet has developed rapidly, broadened access to news, and facilitated mass communications in China, many forms of expression online, as in other mass media, are still significantly stifled. Empirical studies have found that China has one of the most sophisticated content-filtering Internet regimes in the world. The Chinese government employs increasingly sophisticated methods to limit content online, including a combination of legal regulation, surveillance, and punishment to promote self-censorship, as well as technical controls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://italy.usembassy.gov/pdf/other/RL33167.pdf |format=PDF|title=Internet Development and Information Control in the People's Republic of China |accessdate=4 March 2009 |last=Lum |first=Thomas |date=10 February 2006 |work=CRS Report for Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
{{main|Net neutrality in the European Union}}
When the [[European Commission]] consulted on the EU's 2002 regulatory framework for electronic communications in November 2007, it examined the possible need for legislation to mandate network neutrality, countering the potential damage, if any, caused by non-neutral broadband access. The European Commission stated that prioritisation "is generally considered to be beneficial for the market so long as users have choice to access the transmission capabilities and the services they want" and "consequently, the current EU rules allow operators to offer different services to different customers groups, but not allow those who are in a dominant position to discriminate in an anti-competitive manner between customers in similar circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/library/proposals/1472/comm_pdf_sec_2007_1472_1_en_documentdetravail.pdf.pdf|title=Impact Assessment on the proposals to amend the European regulatory framework (Working Document – SEC(2007) 1472) |accessdate=26 December 2008 |author=European Commission |authorlink=European Commission |date=13 November 2007 |format=PDF |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the European Commission highlighted that Europe's current legal framework cannot effectively prevent network operators from degrading their customers' services. Therefore, the European Commission proposed that it should be empowered to impose a minimum quality of services requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/library/proposals/698/com_2007_0698_en.pdf|title=Article 22 of the proposed Universal Service Directive|work=Digital Agenda for Europe|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, an obligation of transparency was proposed to limit network operators' ability to set up restrictions on end-users' choice of lawful content and applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/library/proposals/698/com_2007_0698_en.pdf|title=Article 20(5) of the proposed Universal Service Directive|work=Digital Agenda for Europe|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 2009, the so-called "[[Telecoms Package]]" came into force and EU member states were required to implement the Directive by May 2011.&lt;ref name="Eur-Lex.Europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:FULL:EN:PDF |title=Eur-Lex.Europa.eu |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="businessweek1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Meyer |first=David |url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/may2009/gb2009057_886976.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index+-+temp_global+business |title=Europe Votes Sweeping Telecom Reform |work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |date=7 May 2009 |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the European Commission the new transparency requirements in the Telecoms Package would mean that "consumers will be informed—even before signing a contract—about the nature of the service to which they are subscribing, including traffic management techniques and their impact on service quality, as well as any other limitations (such as bandwidth caps or available connection speed)".&lt;ref name="businessweek1"/&gt; Regulation (EC) No 1211/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 established the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) and the Office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:FULL:EN:PDF |title=Eur-Les.Europa.eu |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communications]].

The European Parliament voted the EU Commission's September 2013 proposal on its first reading in April 2014 and the Council adopted a mandate to negotiate in March 2015. Following the adoption of the Digital Single Market Strategy by the Commission on 6 May, Heads of State and Government agreed on the need to strengthen the EU telecoms single market. After 18 months of negotiations, the European Parliament, Council and Commission reached two agreements on the end to roaming charges and on the first EU-wide rules on net neutrality on 30 June 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-5275_en.htm|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - Roaming charges and open Internet: questions and answers|website=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be completed by an  overhaul of EU telecoms rules in 2016.

===Indonesia===
Indihome, a subsidiary of Telkom Indonesia, is deliberately blocking Netflix and claimed that it is due to censorship and pornographic contents. On the other hand, it promotes Iflix, a Malaysian-based company that provides similar service as Netflix. Ironically the M-17 rated contents are also available on Iflix without further censorship from the provider.

On 8 February 2016, the [[Telecom Regulatory Authority of India]] (TRAI) banned differential pricing of data services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/trai-set-to-bar-differential-pricing-of-data-services-regulations-out-today/articleshow/50900423.cms|title=Trai set to bar differential pricing of data services, regulations out today|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821172404/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/trai-set-to-bar-differential-pricing-of-data-services-regulations-out-today/articleshow/50900423.cms|archivedate=21 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = India blocks Zuckerberg's free net app - BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35522899|website = BBC News|access-date = 2016-02-09|language = en-GB|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160209013308/http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35522899|archivedate = 9 February 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per TRAI's press release, the regulator had multiple responses soliciting different opinions with respect to its consultation paper. Considering all the responses, the regulator decided to have an ex ante regulation instead of a case by case tariff investigation regime. According to the TRAI this decision was reached in order to give the industry participants the much needed certainty and in view of the high costs of regulation in terms of time and resources that will be required for investigating each case of tariff discrimination. Ruling prohibits any service provider from offering or charging discriminatory tariffs for data services on the basis of content and also prohibits any agreement or contract which might have effect of discriminatory tariffs for data services or may assist the service provider in any manner to evade the regulation. It also specifies financial disincentives for contravention of regulation. However, the ruling does not prescribe a blanket ban on differential pricing and provides an exception in case of public emergency or for providing emergency services. Discriminatory tariffs are allowed in the case of an emergency. Lastly, according to TRAI this ruling should not be considered the end of the net neutrality debate. The regulator has promised to keep a close view on the developments in the market and may undertake a review after two years or at an earlier date, as it may deem fit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trai.gov.in/WriteReadData/PressRealease/Document/Press_Release_No_13%20.pdf trai.gov.in] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208211507/http://www.trai.gov.in/WriteReadData/PressRealease/Document/Press_Release_No_13%20.pdf |date=8 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, the TRAI released a formal consultation paper on ''Regulatory Framework for Over-the-top (OTT)'' services, seeking comments from the public. The consultation paper was criticised for being one-sided and having confusing statements. It was condemned by various politicians and Internet users.&lt;ref name=Politicos&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singh|first1=Saurabh|title=Politicos slam TRAI's stance on net neutrality|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/politicos-raise-concern-over-trais-threatening-consultation-on-net-neutrality/1/429135.html|accessdate=12 April 2015|work=[[India Today]]|date=8 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412222226/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/politicos-raise-concern-over-trais-threatening-consultation-on-net-neutrality/1/429135.html|archivedate=12 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gandhi|first1=Rajat|title=Net neutrality: Why Internet is in danger of being shackled |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-04-08/news/60943272_1_net-neutrality-telecom-operators-viber|accessdate=12 April 2015|work=[[The Economic Times]]|date=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TRAIemails&gt;{{cite news|title=Indians rally for Internet freedom, send over 1 lakh emails to TRAI for net neutrality|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/indians-rally-for-internet-freedom-send-over-1-lakh-emails-to-trai-for-net-neutrality/539553-11.html|accessdate=13 April 2015|work=[[IBNLive]]|date=13 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415193045/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/indians-rally-for-internet-freedom-send-over-1-lakh-emails-to-trai-for-net-neutrality/539553-11.html|archivedate=15 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 24 April 2015, over a million emails had been sent to TRAI demanding net neutrality.&lt;ref name=TRAIemails/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=India fights for #NetNeutrality |publisher=Cyber World Mirror |url=http://cyberworldmirror.com/india-fights-for-netneutrality/ |accessdate=25 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503001041/http://cyberworldmirror.com/india-fights-for-netneutrality/ |archivedate=3 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roy|first1=Prasanto|title=India's fight for net neutrality|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-32313704|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 April 2015|location=India|date=18 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420153507/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-32313704|archivedate=20 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Over 3 lakh emails sent to Trai in support of Net Neutrality, so far.|url=http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/over-3-lakh-emails-sent-to-trai-in-support-of-net-neutrality-so-far-263021.html|publisher=FirstPort|accessdate=14 April 2015|date=14 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414210848/http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/over-3-lakh-emails-sent-to-trai-in-support-of-net-neutrality-so-far-263021.html|archivedate=14 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consultation period ended on January 7, 2016.

Ultimately, in the year 2018, the [[Government of India|Indian Government]] unanimously approved new regulations supporting net neutrality. The regulations are considered to be the "world's strongest" net neutrality rules, guaranteeing free and open internet for nearly half a billion people,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/12/technology/india-net-neutrality-rules-telecom/index.html|title=India now has the 'world's strongest' net neutrality rules|last=Iyengar|first=Rishi|date=12 July 2018|website=CNN tech|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are expected to help the culture of [[Startup company|startups]] and innovation. The only exceptions to the rules are new and emerging services like [[autonomous driving]] and [[Telemedicine|tele-medicine]], which may require prioritised internet lanes and faster than normal speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/internet-to-remain-free-and-fair-in-india-govt-approves-net-neutrality/articleshow/64948838.cms|title=Web stays neutral for all as govt clears net neutrality|last=Doval|first=Pankaj|date=12 July 2018|work=The Times of India|access-date=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violations of net neutrality have been common in India. Examples beyond Facebook's [[Internet.org]] include [[Aircel]]'s [[Wikipedia Zero]] along with Aircel's free access to Facebook and [[WhatsApp]], [[Bharti Airtel|Airtel]]'s free access to Google, and [[Reliance Communications|Reliance]]'s free access to Twitter.&lt;ref name="NotJust"&gt;{{cite news|title=Not just Airtel Zero: Facebook to WhatsApp, everyone has violated Net Neutrality in India|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/net-neutrality-debate-its-not-just-limited-to-airtel-zero/|accessdate=4 May 2015|work=[[Indian Express]]|date=18 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504060356/http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/net-neutrality-debate-its-not-just-limited-to-airtel-zero/|archivedate=4 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Net Neutrality: Whose internet is it anyway? |accessdate=20 April 2015 |author=Amrita Madhukalya |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-whose-internet-is-it-anyway-2078659 |work=[[DNA India]] |date=19 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419153307/http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-whose-internet-is-it-anyway-2078659 |archivedate=19 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook's Free Basics program is seen by activists as a net neutrality violation, based on its provision of free-of-cost access to dozens of sites, in collaboration with telecom operators. There were protests online and on ground against the Free Basics program. The Free Software Movement of India also held a protest in [[Hyderabad]] and parts of [[Telangana]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Net-Neutrality-And-the-vigil-continues/articleshow/50493607.cms|title = Net Neutrality: And the vigil continues|date = 8 January 2016|work = |access-date = 9 January 2016|via = The Times of India|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160109082923/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Net-Neutrality-And-the-vigil-continues/articleshow/50493607.cms|archivedate = 9 January 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
In 2011, Israel's parliament passed a law requiring net neutrality in mobile broadband. These requirements were extended to wireline providers in an amendment to the law passed on February 10, 2014. The law contains an exception for reasonable network management, and is vague on a number of issues such as data caps, tiered pricing, paid prioritization and paid peering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://israeltechnologylaw.wordpress.com/2014/02/13/net-neutrality-ii/|title=Net Neutrality II|work=Israel Technology Law Blog|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
Since March 2009 in Italy, there is a bill called:
''Proposta di legge dei senatori Vincenzo VITA (PD) e Luigi Vimercati (PD)''
"Neutralità Delle Reti, Free Software E Societa' Dell'informazione".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punto-informatico.it/2591643/PI/Interviste/ci-vuole-una-legge-rete.aspx |title=PI: Ci vuole una legge per la Rete |publisher=Punto-informatico.it |date=7 February 1996 |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator Vimercati in an interview said that he wants "to do something for the network neutrality" and that he was inspired by Lawrence Lessig, Professor at the Stanford Law School. Vimercati said that the topic is very hard, but in the article 3 there is a reference to the concept of neutrality regard the contents. It is also a problem of transparency and for the mobile connections: we need the minimum bandwidth to guarantee the service. We need some principle to defend the consumers. It's important that the consumer has been informed if he could not access all the Internet.
The bill refuses all the discrimination: related by the content, the service and the device. The bill is generally about Internet ("a statute for the Internet") and treat different topics like network neutrality, free software, giving an Internet access to everyone.

===Japan===
Net neutrality in the [[common carrier]] sense has been instantiated into law in many countries, including Japan. In Japan, the nation's largest phone company, [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone]], operates a service called Flet's Square over their [[FTTH]] high speed Internet connections.

===Netherlands===
{{See also|Net neutrality in the Netherlands}}

In June 2011, the majority of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Dutch lower house]] voted for new net neutrality laws which prohibits the blocking of Internet services, usage of [[deep packet inspection]] to track customer behaviour and otherwise filtering or manipulating network traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tweakers.net/nieuws/75223/tweede-kamer-neemt-telecomwet-met-netneutraliteit-en-cookieregels-aan.html |title=Tweede Kamer neemt Telecomwet met netneutraliteit en cookieregels aan |publisher=Tweakers.net |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation applies to any telecommunications provider and was formally ratified by the Dutch senate on 8 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/kst-24095-281.html |title=Frequentiebeleid; Motie; Motie Braakhuis c.s. over netneutraliteit |publisher=Zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2012/05/08/wet-netneutraliteit-aangenomen-door-eerste-kamer/ |title=Nieuwe Telecomwet aangenomen door Eerste Kamer |work=NRC Handelsblad |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portugal===
{{Expand section|date=June 2018}}
As part of the European Union, Portugal is bound to the laws protecting net neutrality established by the EU in 2002. However, the Portuguese government still allows for certain kinds of pricing models which are banned under most net neutrality rules. They allow for broadband providers to offer special pricing packages in which customers can pay for extra data that is only designated for the use of specific websites. For example, one package allows customers to pay extra for more data that can be used for social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter. However, many supporters of net neutrality in Portugal have objected to this pricing model on the grounds that it creates another barrier to entry for all internet companies that are not included in the special data packages.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.euronews.com/2017/11/29/the-truth-about-portugal-s-net-neutrality-told-by-an-expert|title=The truth about Portugal's net neutrality, told by an expert|last=De Oliva|first=Ana|date=December 29, 2017|work=Euronews|access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These kinds of pricing packages are not specifically addressed in the EU net neutrality rules, so they have been allowed to continue. However, on February 28, 2018, Anacom, the telecommunications regulatory agency in Portugal, accused the country's main broadband providers, MEO, NOS, and Vodafone, of violating the EU rules on net neutrality with their extra data packages. They granted the providers up to forty days to change their pricing packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/portugal-telecoms/portugal-telecoms-in-breach-of-net-neutrality-rules-regulator-says-idUKL8N1QI819|title=Portugal telecoms in breach of net neutrality rules, regulator says|last=Bugge|first=Axel|date=February 28, 2018|work=Reuters|access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the law does not specify what sanctions are appropriate, leading to an unclear future in this ongoing battle.

After almost 4 years of discussion, in early 2016 [[Federal Antimonopoly Service]] approved a regulation blocking ISPs from throttling or otherwise blocking any websites apart from those blocked at the request of the [[Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media]], thus protecting net neutrality in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osp.ru/news/2016/0217/13031700|title=В России начали действовать принципы сетевой нейтральности {{!}} Все новости мира компьютеров и связи {{!}} OSP News {{!}} Издательство "Открытые системы"|website=www.osp.ru|language=en|access-date=2017-11-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201035418/https://www.osp.ru/news/2016/0217/13031700|archivedate=1 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.garant.ru/news/697085/|title=Определены основы управления интернет-трафиком|access-date=2017-11-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033609/http://www.garant.ru/news/697085/|archivedate=1 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, the Russian government's Resolution No 575 introduced regulation rules of telematics services. [[Internet service provider|Network operators]] (ISPs) could legally limit individual actions of the subscriber's network activity, if such actions threatened the normal functioning of the network. ISPs were obliged to exclude the possibility of access to information systems, network addresses, or uniform pointers which a subscriber informs the operator of communication in the form specified in the contract. The subscriber was obliged to take actions to protect the subscriber terminal from the impact of malicious software and to prevent the spread of [[spam (electronic)|spam]] and [[Malware|malicious software]] to its subscriber terminal. In reality, most Russian ISPs shaped the traffic of [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P protocols]] (like [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]]) with lower priority (P2P was about of 80% of traffic there). Also, there was popular method, called retracker,&lt;ref name="retracker"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://wiki.rutracker.org/Retracker.local |title=Local Retracker method of caching p2p traffic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/ICNS.2010.25 CARMA Based MST Approximation for Multicast Provision in P2P Networks] {{doi|10.1109/ICNS.2010.25}} quote:"Recently there have been some advances in the locality awareness for BitTorrent networks. Popular nationwide trackers (torrents.ru, for instance) have introduced so-called "retrackers"{{spaced ndash}}dedicated secondary servers. These servers are optionally connected to primary database but mainly supposed to only return peer list local to specific network scope."&lt;/ref&gt; for redirecting some [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] traffic to the ISP's cache servers and other subscribers inside of a [[metropolitan area network]] (MAN). Access to MANs is usually with greater speed (2x–1000x or more, specified in the contract) and better quality than the rest of the Internet.

In 2014 and 2015, there were efforts to charge [[over-the-top content]] (OTT) providers (companies that provide [[streaming video]]). [[Infocomm Development Authority]] (IDA) has a Policy Framework for net neutrality that did not allow a surcharge. Consumers also argued that they already pay for their service and that they shouldn't have to pay more to access the sites they want to.

===Slovenia===
At the end of 2012, Slovenia legislated a law of electronic communication implementing a strong principle of net neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Uradni list Republike Slovenije|url = https://www.uradni-list.si/1/content?id=111442|website = www.uradni-list.si|accessdate = 2015-10-10|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151006163114/http://www.uradni-list.si/1/content?id=111442|archivedate = 6 October 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slovenia]] thus became the second country in Europe to enact a net neutrality law. The Government Agency for Communications, Networks and Services (AKOS) is enforcing the law and executes inspections. In January 2015 it found [[zero-rating]] infringements at the two largest mobile network providers, Telekom Slovenije and Si.mobil (now A1),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AKOS: Telekom Slovenije in Simobil kršila nevtralnost interneta @ Slo-Tech|url = https://slo-tech.com/novice/t634024|website = slo-tech.com|access-date = 2016-01-14|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035044/https://slo-tech.com/novice/t634024|archivedate = 4 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were respectively "zero-rating the Deezer music service and the 'Hangar mapa' cloud storage service."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyslegaledge.com/2015/01/net-neutrality-zero-rating-and-todays-news-from-the-netherlands-and-slovenia/|title=Net neutrality, zero-rating and today's news from the Netherlands and Slovenia|last=Conradi|first=Mike|date=January 29, 2015|website=DLA Piper|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, AKOS banned zero rating for all services except three owned by the state incumbent.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} For this, AKOS was sued by Slovenia's telecom operators for violating their own net neutrality rules.

In July 2016 the Administrative Court of the Republic of Slovenia annulled the January 2015 AKOS decisions regarding price discrimination, stating that since it does not "restrict, delay or slow down Internet traffic at the level of individual services or applications" it does not violate net neutrality. The court also said that the Slovenian Electronic Communications Act "does not prohibit zero rating outright."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyslegaledge.com/2017/07/zero-rating-and-net-neutrality-decisions-so-far-in-the-eu/|title=Zero-rating and net neutrality – decisions (so far) in the EU|last=Conradi|first=Mike|date=July 26, 2017|website=DLA Piper|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling was in accordance with the Competition Protection Agency (CPA), who felt that the "prohibition of zero-rated services may have been detrimental rather than beneficial for consumers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/publications/reports/kd0217687enn.pdf|title=Zero-rating practices in broadband markets|last=DotEcon Ltd|first=|date=February 2017|website=European Commission|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four months after the ruling of the Administrative Court, in November 2016, AKOS found Telekom Slovenije and Si.mobil in violation of net neutrality laws for discriminating against non-zero-rated traffic for customers who exceeded their monthly data limits.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Slovenia===
In Slovenia, with 1 January 2013 there is a new telecommunication law in effect which explicitly defines and requires net neutrality from telecommunication operators. Net neutrality is defined as a principle that every Internet traffic on a public communication network is dealt with equally, independent of content, applications, services, devices, source and destination of the communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wlan-si.net/en/blog/2013/06/16/net-neutrality-in-slovenia/|title=Wlan slovenija unofficial translation|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
{{As of|2016}}, there is no law on net neutrality in South Africa. A White Paper was to be published by the South African government in March, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pmg.org.za/committee-meeting/20996/|title=ICT Policy Review recommendations and implementation plan: briefing by Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services &amp; panel members {{!}} PMG|website=pmg.org.za|access-date=2016-06-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812055654/https://pmg.org.za/committee-meeting/20996/|archivedate=12 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has not been published yet. However, the telecommunications regulator [[Independent Communications Authority of South Africa|ICASA]], and the [[Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services]] has been engaged in this debate. In March 2014, ICASA invited comments to its "Notice of Public Inquiry into the State of Competition in the Information and Communications Technology Sector",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.icasa.org.za/Portals/0/Regulations/Working%2520Docmuents/NoticePublInqState%2520OfComp.pdf |title=Request Rejected |website=www.icasa.org.za |access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which net neutrality was brought up, and comments were invited on the stakeholders' views on enforcement of net neutrality in South Africa.

Simultaneously, DTPS was in the process of providing an integrated [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] policy review, to provide recommendations on various issues of ICT policy in South Africa. They published a Green Paper and invited comments to the same. The Green Paper did not venture into the debate of net neutrality in detail and simply stated that it is an issue that must be taken into consideration. Following the Green Paper, a Discussion Paper was published in November, 2014, which also invited comments. Lastly, a [https://web.archive.org/web/20160927221802/http://www.dtps.gov.za/documents-publications/ict-policy-review/category/102-ict-policy-review-reports-2015.html Final Report] was published in June, 2015 by DTPS providing its policy recommendations. DTPS recommended that the broad tenets of net neutrality be adopted, with principles such as transparency, no blocking of lawful content, and no unreasonable discrimination in mind. They urged the government to set appropriate exceptions to the application of network neutrality principles, such as emergency services, blocking of unlawful content, etc.

===United Kingdom===
In comparison to the United States, the debate concerning Net Neutrality is one that has not received much attention in the United Kingdom. The officials merely refer to such a concept as an open internet, as net neutrality is a term used originally in American politics. While it does seem to be a non-issue in the UK, there is indeed a defining characteristic in the neutrality debate there, as the arguments are often shaped by regulators. Also, these arguments are often influenced by the discourse of other countries in Europe, so much of the discussions that the UK has about open internet will be linked with those of other European countries listed on this page.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Alison1, A.Powell@lse.ac.uk and Alissa2 Cooper.

===United States===
{{Main |Net neutrality in the United States}}
{{Long section|date=June 2018}}
In 2005, under Republican Chair Abernathy, the FCC adopted policies and rules establishing principles of "network neutrality" in order to carry out the policy of the United States "to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet" and "to promote the continued development of the Internet," "encourag[ing] the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability" – broadband – "to all Americans.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-151A1.pdf|title=Appropriate Framework for Broadband Access to the Internet over Wireline Facilities|website=Federal Communications Commission|language=en|access-date=2018-02-23|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC noted that Congress had cited the Internet's educational and informational importance, and the fact that "[t]he Internet also represents "a forum for a true diversity of political discourse, unique opportunities for cultural development, and myriad avenues for intellectual activity," as well as "play[ing] an important role in the economy, as an engine for productivity growth and cost savings."

One article on Net Neutrality detailed not only what it means for educators, but also described what would happen if it were to be taken away. The author, Chad Sansing, goes on to say that "...Without net neutrality, regardless of how much bandwidth any particular user has, Internet service providers can “throttle” the speed of delivery to privilege some bits of information over others, effectively slowing down some websites and services while speeding up others."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ezproxy.lib.usf.edu/login|title=USF NetID Single-SignOn {{!}} University of South Florida|last=Florida|first=University of South|website=ezproxy.lib.usf.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order "to ensure that providers of telecommunications for Internet access or Internet Protocol-enabled (IP-enabled) services are operated in a neutral manner," and noting that its "Enforcement Bureau recently entered into a consent decree to resolve an investigation with respect to the blocking of ports used for voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)," the Commission adopted network neutrality principles "to preserve and promote the vibrant and open character of the Internet as the telecommunications marketplace enters the broadband age." The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals said, however, that because the FCC had previously said broadband Internet access services were not common carrier services, the common carrier network neutrality regulations exceeded the authority the FCC had imposed on itself. Therefore, in 2015, the FCC changed its analysis, reclassified retail providers of BIAS as common carriers, and adopted revised open Internet requirements.

Following the ruling in [[Verizon Communications Inc. v.

In January 2017, the [[Trump administration]] took office and [[Ajit Varadaraj Pai]] was appointed as FCC commissioner. On April 29, 2017, Pai released a proposal suggesting reclassification of broadband access as an information service and a decrease in legal regulations on Internet service providers.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170429"&gt;{{cite news |author=The Editorial Board |title=F.C.C.

On February 2, 2018, the FCC informed the Senate of its plans to repeal net neutrality rules. This gave Congress 60 days to stop the repeal with the [[Congressional Review Act]] (CRA) before they can no longer do so. Both the Senate and House must pass the CRA measure for the repeal to succeed.

On June 11, 2018, the FCC's repealing of net neutrality rules went into effect.

There is ongoing legal and political wrangling in the U.S. regarding net neutrality. The United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] is in charge of regulating Internet service providers' conduct in the US, though the extent of its jurisdiction is subject to ongoing legal disputes.&lt;ref&gt;The [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] declared that the FCC did not have jurisdiction under Title I of the [[Communications Act of 1934]] in ''[[Comcast Corp. v. FCC]]''. The FCC's rules claim authority under a wide-range of other provisions of the [[Communications Act of 1934]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====US FCC policy (2010-2017)====
Under commission chairman Julius Genachowski, the FCC proposed reclassifying broadband Internet access providers under the provisions of Title&amp;nbsp;2 of the Communications Act in an effort to force the providers to adhere to the same rules as telephone networks. This adjustment was meant to prevent, "unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities or services".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/05/fcc-on-net-neutrality-yes-we-can.ars |title=FCC on net neutrality: yes we can |accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 December 2010, these changes were put into effect by the [[FCC Open Internet Order 2010]], which banned [[cable television]] and [[telephone]] service providers from preventing access to competitors or certain web sites such as [[Netflix]]. The rules also include a more limited set of obligations for wireless providers. The rules would not keep ISPs from charging more for faster access. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in [[United States Congress|Congress]] threatened to reverse the rules through legislation.&lt;ref name=Dec21&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesunnews.com/2010/12/22/1881959/fcc-adopts-web-rules.html|title=FCC adopts web rules|last=Bartash|first=Jeffry|work=MarketWatch|date=22 December 2010|accessdate=22 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717035844/http://www.thesunnews.com/2010/12/22/1881959/fcc-adopts-web-rules.html|archivedate=17 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 September 2011, the FCC released its final rules for Preserving a Free and Open Internet. These rules state that providers must have transparency of network management practices, not block lawful content, nor unreasonably discriminate in transmitting lawful network traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-09-23/pdf/2011-24259.pdf|title=Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 185|date=September 23, 2011|website=[[United States Government Publishing Office|gpo.gov]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rules are effective 20 November 2011.

On 14 January 2014, the DC Circuit Court determined in ''[[Verizon Communications Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission (2014)]]'' that the FCC has no authority to enforce Network Neutrality rules, as service providers are not identified as "common carriers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robertson|first=Adi|title=Federal court strikes down FCC net neutrality rules|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/14/5307650/federal-court-strikes-down-net-neutrality-rules|publisher=The Verge|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 14 January ruling, [[AT&amp;T]] has submitted several patents &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US20140010082|title=Patent US20140010082 - Prevention Of Bandwidth Abuse Of A Communications System - Google Patents|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that account for specific ways to take advantage of the FCC's limited authority. [[Verizon]] is also under a mountain of allegations that they have been slowing access to both [[Netflix]] and to the [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] Cloud services, although the company denies these allegations. Multiple independent sources have performed network speed analysis and do find slower connection times to these sites, although there is currently no proof that Verizon is purposefully causing these slowdowns.

On 29 April 2017, a clearer understanding of the latest proposal to compromise net neutrality has been described.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170429" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNET-20170502" /&gt;

The new proposed rules have received heavy criticisms, with many claiming they are ruining the internet; others have shown significant support. Proponents of the rules declared September 10, 2014 to be the "Internet Slowdown".

The '''PROTECT IP Act''' ('''Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act''', or '''PIPA''') was a [[Bill (proposed law)|proposed law]] with the stated goal of giving the US government and copyright holders additional tools to curb access to "rogue websites dedicated to the sale of infringing or counterfeit goods", especially those registered outside the U.S.&lt;ref name="CNet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20062398-281.html|title=Senate bill amounts to death penalty for Web sites|date=May 12, 2011 |work=CNet|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was introduced on May 12, 2011, by Senator [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-Vt.) and 11 bipartisan co-sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 968: Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act of 2011|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s112-968|publisher=[[GovTrack]]|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimated that implementation of the bill would cost the federal government $47 million through 2016, to cover enforcement costs and the hiring and training of 22 new special agents and 26 support staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/177531-cbo-scores-protect-ip-act CBO Scores PROTECT IP Act]; The Hill; August 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] passed the bill, but Senator [[Ron Wyden]] (D-Ore.) placed a [[Senate hold|hold]] on it.&lt;ref name=wyden-press-release&gt;{{cite web|last=Wyden|first=Ron|title=Overreaching Legislation Still Poses a Significant Threat to Internet Commerce, Innovation and Free Speech. |url=http://wyden.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/?id=33a39533-1b25-437b-ad1d-9039b44cde92|publisher=Sovereign|accessdate=May 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill defines infringement as distribution of illegal copies, counterfeit goods, or anti-[[digital rights management]] technology.

The bill provides for "enhancing enforcement against rogue websites operated and registered overseas" and authorizes the United States Department of Justice to seek a court order ''[[in rem]]'' against websites dedicated to infringing activities, if through [[due diligence]], an individual owner or operator cannot be located.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s112-968&amp;version=rs&amp;nid=t0%3Ars%3A222 PROTECT IP Act of 2011, S. 968, 112th Cong. § 3(b)(1)]; "Text of S. 968," Govtrack.us.

==Reception==
On January 14, 2012, [[White House]] officials posted a statement saying, "Any effort to combat online piracy must guard against the risk of online censorship of lawful activity and must not inhibit innovation by our dynamic businesses large and small", and "We must avoid creating new cybersecurity risks or disrupting the underlying architecture of the Internet."&lt;ref name="WH-Report-20120114"&gt;{{cite report |last1=Espinel |first1=Victoria |last2=Chopra |first2=Aneesh |last3=Schmidt |first3=Howard |title=Combating Online Piracy While Protecting an Open and Innovative Internet |url= https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/response/combating-online-piracy-while-protecting-open-and-innovative-internet |date=January 14, 2012 |publisher=[[White House]] |access-date=January 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WH-Blog-20120114"&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips |first=Mark |title=Obama Administration Responds to We the People Petitions on SOPA and Online Piracy |url= http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/01/14/obama-administration-responds-we-people-petitions-sopa-and-online-piracy |date=January 14, 2012 |publisher=[[White House Blog]] |accessdate=January 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20120114"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wyatt |first=Edward |title=White House Says It Opposes Parts of Two Antipiracy Bills |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/us/white-house-says-it-opposes-parts-of-2-antipiracy-bills.html |date=January 14, 2012 |publisher=[[NY Times]] |accessdate=January 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20120114"&gt;{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=Ken |title=White House concerned over online piracy bills |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20120114/D9S8SL501.html |date=January 14, 2012 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=January 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical objections to DNS blocking and redirection===
The bill originally contained measures which would allow the stripping of rogue websites out of the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS), the Internet's virtual "phone book."  If a user entered the web address of a rogue site, it would appear the site did not exist.  The bill's sponsors have said they are removing this provision.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2012/01/17/gIQA4WYl6P_story_1.html "SOPA protests to shut down Web sites"] ''[[The Washington Post]]'' January 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sherwin Siy of ''[[Public Knowledge]]'', past attempts to limit copyright infringement online by way of blocking domains have always generated criticism that doing so would fracture the Domain Name System and threaten the global functionality of the Internet, with the original draft of this bill being no different. By design, all domain name servers worldwide should contain identical lists; with the changes initially proposed, servers inside the United States would have records different from their global counterparts, making [[URL]]s less universal.&lt;ref name=publicknowledge&gt;{{cite web|last=Siy|first=Sherwin|title=COICA v. 2.0: the PROTECT IP Act|url=http://www.publicknowledge.org/blog/coica-v-20-protect-ip-act|work=Policy Blog|publisher=Public Knowledge|accessdate=May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcworld.com/article/228774/senate_panel_approves_controversial_copyright_bill.html Senate Panel Approves Controversial Copyright Bill]; PC World; May 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Five Internet engineers ([[Steve Crocker]], David Dagon, [[Dan Kaminsky]], Danny McPherson, and [[Paul Vixie]]) prepared a [[whitepaper]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circleid.com/pdf/PROTECT-IP-Technical-Whitepaper-Final.pdf PROTECT IP Technical Whitepaper]; May 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; which states that the DNS filtering provisions in the original bill "raise serious technical and security concerns" and would "break the Internet", while other engineers and proponents of the act have called those concerns groundless and without merit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hightechforum.org/dns-filtering-is-essential-to-the-internet/ DNS Filtering is Essential to the Internet]; HighTech Forum; June 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hightechforum.org/the-big-debate-on-dns-filtering-and-dnssec/ The Big Debate on DNS Filtering and DNSSEC]; HighTech Forum; July 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--deadlink&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/59599226/Debunking-DNS-Filtering-Concerns Debunking DNS Filtering Concerns]; High Tech Forum; June 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name="New tools to combat thieves online"&gt;[http://dailycaller.com/2011/10/25/new-tools-to-combat-thieves-online/ New tools to combat thieves online]; The Daily Caller; October 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/393667/engineers_protect_ip_act_would_break_dns/ Engineers: PROTECT IP Act would break DNS]; PC World&amp;nbsp;– Australia; July 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/05/dns-filtering/#more-26745|title=Internet Researchers Decry DNS-Filtering Legislation|author=David Kravets|work=Wired |date=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20069824-281/protect-ip-copyright-bill-faces-growing-criticism/|title=Protect IP copyright bill faces growing criticism|author=Declan McCullagh|publisher=CNet News|date=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pirates"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/18/opinion/l18internet.html?_r=1 Stopping the Pirates Who Roam the Web]; ''The New York Times''; June 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; One concern expressed by network experts is that hackers would offer workarounds to private users to allow access to government-seized sites, but these workarounds might also jeopardize security by redirecting unsuspecting users to scam websites. Supporters of the bill, such as the MPAA and RIAA, have argued that widespread circumvention of the filtering would be unlikely. The CEO of the [[Information Technology and Innovation Foundation]] compared the DNS provisions to car door locks, noting that while they aren't foolproof against thieves, we should still use them.&lt;ref name="New tools to combat thieves online"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pirates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nationaljournal.com"&gt;[http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/internet-bill-could-help-hackers-experts-warn-20110714 Internet Bill Could Help Hackers, Experts Warn]; NationalJournal; July 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of Law professors, quoting Crocker's whitepaper, say that the PROTECT IP and Stop Online Piracy Acts could have the opposite of the intended impact, driving users to unregulated alternative DNS systems, and hindering the government from conducting legitimate Internet regulation.&lt;ref name="standfordlaw"/&gt; They question the constitutionality of both bills, believing they could have potentially disastrous technical consequences and would make US Internet law more like those of repressive regimes.&lt;ref name="standfordlaw"/&gt; They go on to state that both bills provide "nothing more than ex parte proceedings—proceedings at which only one side (the prosecutor or even a private plaintiff) need present evidence and the operator of the allegedly infringing site need not be present nor even made aware that the action was pending against his or her 'property.' This not only violates basic principles of due process by depriving persons of property without a fair hearing and a reasonable opportunity to be heard, it also constitutes an unconstitutional abridgement of the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment."&lt;ref name="standfordlaw"/&gt;

A browser plugin called [[MAFIAAFire Redirector]] was created in March 2011 that redirects visitors to an alternative domain when a site's primary domain has been seized. The Mozilla Foundation says that [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) requested by phone that [[Mozilla]] remove the plugin, a request with which they have not yet complied. Instead, Mozilla's legal counsel has asked for further information from the DHS, including legal justification for the request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20060636-281.html Mozilla fights DHS over anti-MPAA, RIAA utility]; CNET News; May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Information Technology and Innovation Foundation]] (ITIF) argued that concerns about the domain name remedy in the legislation were undercut by the already ongoing use of these approaches to counter spam and malware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Castro03142011.pdf Hearings Before the Committee on Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition, and the Internet]; Page 10; March 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Daniel Castro, an ITIF analyst, DNS blocking is practiced in several democracies without "breaking the internet", including the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland and South Korea.&lt;ref name="Ars Technica 20009"/&gt;  ITIF's CEO compared the DNS provisions to car door locks, writing that even though they aren't foolproof they can still be useful.&lt;ref name="Pirates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nationaljournal.com"/&gt;

On January 12, 2012, [[Patrick Leahy|Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)]], Chairman of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], said he would be willing to remove a controversial DNS-filtering provision from the bill. "I've authorized my staff to tell ... the other senators that I'm willing to hold that back in the final piece of legislation," Senator Leahy said. "That in itself will remove a lot of the opposition that we now have."&lt;ref name="National Journal"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gruenwald |first=Juliana |title=Leahy Offers Major Concession On Online Piracy Bill |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/leahy-offers-major-concession-on-online-piracy-bill-20120112/ |date=January 12, 2012 |publisher=[[National Journal]] |accessdate=January 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://leahy.senate.gov/press/press_releases/release/?id=721ddff6-3399-4d56-a966-bca3f848759b Comment Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Internet Service Providers And The PROTECT IP Act]; Press Release&amp;nbsp;– Leahy; January 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lamar S.

===Civil liberties issues===
[[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] scholars [[Laurence Tribe]] and [[Marvin Ammori]] raised concerns over how the PROTECT IP act would impact free speech, arguing that the act doesn't target just foreign rogue sites, and would extend to "domestic websites that merely 'facilitate' or 'enable' infringement.  Thus, in their language, the bills target considerable protected speech on legitimate sites such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ammori |first=Marvin |title=Controversial Copyright Bills Would Violate First Amendment–Letters to Congress by Laurence Tribe and Me |url=http://ammori.org/2011/12/08/controversial-copyright-bills-would-violate-first-amendment-letters-to-congress-by-laurence-tribe-and-me/|date=December 8, 2011 |website=Ammori.org |accessdate=January 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammori says that the PROTECT IP Act and the Stop Online Piracy Act "would miss their mark and silence a lot of non-infringing speech."&lt;ref name="Should Copyright Be Allowed to Override Speech Rights?"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ammori |first=Marvin |title=Should Copyright Be Allowed to Override Speech Rights? |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/12/should-copyright-be-allowed-to-override-speech-rights/249910/ |date=December 15, 2011 |publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |accessdate=January 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill has been criticized by Abigail Phillips of the Electronic Frontier Foundation for not being specific about what constitutes an infringing web site. For example, if [[WikiLeaks]] were accused of distributing copyrighted content, U.S. search engines could be served a court order to block search results pointing to Wikileaks. Requiring search engines to remove links to an entire website altogether due to an infringing page would raise free speech concerns regarding lawful content hosted elsewhere on the site.&lt;ref name="eff01" /&gt;

[[Google]] chairman [[Eric Schmidt]] stated that the measures called for in PIPA are overly simple solutions to a complex problem, and that the precedent set by pruning DNS entries is bad from the viewpoint of [[free speech]] and would be a step toward less permissive Internet environments, such as China's. As the chairman of the company that owns the world's largest search engine, Schmidt said "If there is a law that requires DNSs to do X and it's passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President of the United States and we disagree with it then we would still fight it."&lt;ref name=guardian-schmidt&gt;{{cite news|last=Halliday|first=Josh|title=Google boss: anti-piracy laws would be disaster for free speech|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/18/google-eric-schmidt-piracy|accessdate=May 24, 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constitutional law expert [[Floyd Abrams]] said, "The Protect&lt;!--sic--&gt; IP Act neither compels nor prohibits free speech or communication... the bill sets a high bar in defining when a website or domain is eligible for potential actions by the Attorney General...".&lt;ref name="Abrams1"&gt;Letter from Floyd Abrams, to Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member Grassley, and Senator Hatch, (May 23, 2011), [http://www.fightonlinetheft.com/sites/default/files/file/Voices%20of%20Support/PROTECT%20IP%20Act/Protect%20IP%20Act%20Letter%20by%20Floyd%20Abrams%205%2023%2011.pdf Letter of Support] (Retrieved June 23, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concern for user-generated sites===

Opponents of the legislation warn that the PROTECT IP Act would have a negative impact on online communities. Journalist [[Rebecca MacKinnon]] argued in an [[op-ed]] that making companies liable for users' actions could have a [[chilling effect (law)|chilling effect]] on user-generated sites like YouTube. "The intention is not the same as [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|China's Great Firewall]], a nationwide system of Web censorship, but the practical effect could be similar", she says.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/16/opinion/firewall-law-could-infringe-on-free-speech.html?_r=1 Stop the Great Firewall of America] By REBECCA MacKINNON, NYT November 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Policy analysts for [[New America Foundation]] say this legislation would enable law enforcement to take down an entire domain due to something posted on a single blog: "Yes, an entire, largely innocent online community could be punished for the actions of a tiny minority."&lt;ref name="The Internet's Intolerable Acts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technocracy/2011/12/stop_online_piracy_act_and_protect_ip_act_a_pair_of_bills_that_threaten_internet_freedom_.html |title=The Internet's Intolerable Acts |author=James Losey &amp; Sascha Meinrath |publisher=Slate Magazine |date=December 8, 2011 |accessdate=December 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business and innovation issues===

A legal analysis by the [[Congressional Research Service]] (CRS) notes concerns by opponents such as [[American Express]] and [[Google]] that the inclusion of a private cause of action would result in stifled Internet innovation, protect outdated business models and at the cost of an overwhelming number of suits from content producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Legal Analysis of S. 968, the PROTECT IP Act|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41911.pdf|author=Brian Yeh, Jonathan Miller|publisher=Congressional Research Service|date=July 7, 2011|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

"Rogue sites jeopardize jobs for film and TV workers," according to the Motion Picture Association of America, which cites several government and independent industry studies on the effects of online piracy, including a report&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.envisional.com/docs/Envisional-Internet_Usage-Jan2011.pdf Technical Report: An Estimate of Infringing Use of the Internet]; Envisional Ltd.; January 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; by ''Envisional Ltd.'' which concluded that one quarter of the content on the internet infringes copyright.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpaa.org/contentprotection/roguewebsites Rogue Websites]; Motion Picture Association of America; March 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpaa.org/policy/industry Industry Reports]; Motion Picture Association of America; March 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpaa.org/Resources/8c33fb87-1ceb-456f-9a6e-f897759b9b44.pdf The Cost of Content Theft by the Numbers]; Motion Picture Association of America&lt;/ref&gt; The Recording Industry Association of America points to a 2007 study&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipi.org/IPI/IPIPublications.nsf/PublicationLookupExecutiveSummary/9631E78559D421458625733E0052D370 Executive Summary]; Institute for Policy Innovation;&lt;/ref&gt; by the ''Institute for Policy Innovation'' which found that online piracy caused $12.5 billion in losses to the U.S. economy and more than 70,000 lost jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/physicalpiracy.php?content_selector=piracy_details_online |title=Who Music Theft Hurts |publisher=Recording Industry Association of America |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://riaa.com/physicalpiracy.php?content_selector=piracy-online-scope-of-the-problem Scope of the Problem]; Recording Industry Association of America&lt;/ref&gt;

"If we need to amend the DMCA, let's do it with a negotiation between the interested parties, not with a bill written by the content industry's lobbyists and jammed through Congress on a fast track," wrote venture capitalist and [[Business Insider]] columnist [[Fred Wilson (financier)|Fred Wilson]] in an October 29 editorial on the changes that the House and Senate versions of the proposed legislation would make to the safe harbor provisions of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]]. "Companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, and startups like Dropbox, Kickstarter, and Twilio are the leading exporters and job creators of this time. They are the golden goose of the economy and we cannot kill the golden goose to protect industries in decline," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protecting The Safe Harbors of the DMCA And Protecting Jobs|url=http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-10-29/tech/30338451_1_online-piracy-negotiation-dmca|author=Fred Wilson|date=October 29, 2011|work=A VC|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Online protests against the bill and announcement of delay==
On January 18, 2012, [[Protests against SOPA and PIPA|widespread online protests]] against SOPA and PIPA were held that included an English Wikipedia blackout.

'''''Please Murder Me''''' is a 1956 American [[film noir]] film directed by [[Peter Godfrey (director)|Peter Godfrey]], and starring [[Angela Lansbury]] and [[Raymond Burr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{AFI film|id=51955|title=Please Murder Me}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is in the [[public domain]] and is available for free download at the [[Internet Archive]].

==Plot==
Defense lawyer Craig Carlson ([[Raymond Burr]]) buys a pistol at a pawn shop and travels to his office, where he deposits the gun in a desk drawer with a file folder, then begins to dictate into a tape recorder. Directing his message to District Attorney Ray Willis ([[John Dehner]]), he reveals that he anticipates being murdered within an hour, and begins to tell his story in extended flashbacks.

The memories begin with him explaining to his war buddy and best friend Joe Leeds ([[Dick Foran]]) that he is having an affair with Leeds' wife Myra ([[Angela Lansbury]]), who wants a divorce. Joe asks Craig to give him a little time to think the matter over. Days later at his own office, Joe finishes writing a letter and gives it to his business partner Lou Kazarian to mail. Joe phones Myra telling her he will be home soon to discuss something. There, he confronts Myra in their bedroom, where a door is closed and a gunshot is heard. Police investigate Joe's death. Myra explains that Joe became irate and threatened her physically, forcing her to shoot him in self-defense. Craig is also on the scene, having arrived before the police and acting as Myra's lawyer.

In the ensuing trial, DA Willis allows the police to present their evidence that a physical struggle did not occur as she'd said. Willis notes that Myra was not employed when she first met Joe, a successful businessman with a good amount of life insurance. In her defense, Craig attributes Myra's inconsistencies regarding the night in question as post-traumatic hysteria.  In his closing argument, Craig claims the money motive in Willis' case is not valid because Myra was in love with another man — a revelation that could inspire Joe to cause Myra premeditated harm. Craig then reveals that he himself is Myra's lover.
[[Image:Angela Lansbury and Raymond Burr in Please Murder Me.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Angela Lansbury and Raymond Burr]]
The jury finds Myra not guilty. She and Craig throw a party to celebrate with friends. When Lou arrives, he reveals privately to Craig that he had forgotten to mail Joe's letter, which was addressed to Craig. Joe discloses in the letter that Myra did indeed marry him for his money, but that she was actually in love with an artist, not with Craig. Joe had decided to ask her to stay married, in part to save Craig from her. Craig then remembers Myra mentioning that an "old friend", an artist named Carl Holt, had visited her in jail during the trial.

Craig goes to see Holt, who explains his long relationship with Myra, interrupted by her marriage to Joe, and states his gratitude and admiration for Craig in his defense work in Myra's trial, especially his posing as Myra's lover as a tactic. Craig later confronts Myra with Joe's letter and his talk with Holt. She admits that she does intend to go on with Holt now she is free.

Accusing her of costing him his best friend, the love of his life and his profession all at once, Craig tells Myra she will pay for her crime regardless, because he will force her to murder him. Myra is incredulous, but Craig soon puts a plan in motion, developing a friendship with Holt, even employing him to paint a portrait to delay Myra and Holt's departure to Europe to marry. All the while, Craig taunts Myra that he will reveal all the evidence to Holt and let him decide if he wants to marry a murderess. As well, Craig meets socially with DA Willis, discussing Myra's case, and lets Myra see them together.

Craig concludes his story being dictated into the tape recorder by saying he has arranged to meet Myra at the office at 12:30 am, which soon arrives. Hearing a knock at the office door, Craig leaves the recorder running and hides the microphone behind a desk photo of himself and Joe, then lets in Myra. He shows her the file he says is full of evidence he's compiled against her, and then sets down the pistol on the desk.

As he starts to make a phone call to Holt, Myra, successfully driven to desperation, takes the gun and shoots Craig, who falls to the floor. Using a handkerchief, she hangs up the phone and wipes her fingerprints from the gun, which she puts in Craig's hand. She finds the file is full of nothing but blank sheets of paper. When DA Willis arrives, she explains that Craig has shot himself. After checking that Craig is in fact dead, Willis learns that Myra had an appointment with Craig for 12:30, then tells her Craig had invited him to come at 12:40. He finds the microphone and recorder, then stops and rewinds the tape. As he begins to play Craig's recording, Myra starts crying, defeated.

The '''Prostitution Reform Act 2003''' is an Act of Parliament that decriminalised [[prostitution in New Zealand]]. It has attracted international attention, although its reception has been mixed. The Act repealed the [[Massage Parlours Act 1978]] and the associated regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2003/0028/latest/DLM198310.html Prostitution Reform Act 2003], Part 4 Miscellaneous provisions&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4279">{{distinguish|Proxy war}}
A '''proxy fight''', '''proxy contest''' or '''proxy battle''', sometimes also called a '''proxy war''', is an unfriendly contest for the control over an organization. The event usually occurs when corporation's stockholders develop opposition to some aspect of the corporate governance, often focusing on directorial and management positions. Corporate activists may attempt to persuade shareholders to use their [[Proxy voting|proxy votes]] (i.e., votes by one individual or institution as the authorized representative of another) to install new management for any of a variety of reasons. Shareholders of a public corporation may appoint an [[Proxy firm|agent]] to attend shareholder meetings and vote on their behalf. That agent is the shareholder's proxy.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Ramseyer, and Bainbridge. Business Associations: Cases and Materials on Agency, Partnerships, and Corporations. (7th Ed.) Foundation Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a proxy fight, [[Incumbent#In business|incumbent]] directors and management have the odds stacked in their favor over those trying to force the corporate change. These incumbents use various corporate governance tactics to stay in power, including: staggering the boards (i.e., having different election years for different directors), controlling access to the corporation's money, and creating restrictive requirements in the [[bylaws]]. As a result, most proxy fights are unsuccessful. However, it has been recently noted that proxy fights waged by [[hedge fund]]s are successful more than 60% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01432.x/full.html Klein, April and Zur, Emanuel. 2009. Entrepreneurial shareholder activism: Hedge funds and other private investors. Journal of Finance 64(1): 187-229.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*An acquiring company, frustrated by the [[Takeover#Tactics against hostile takeover|takeover defense]]s of the management, may initiate a proxy fight to install a more compliant management of the target.
*An early history of proxy fighting, detailing such 1950s battles as the fight for control of some of U.S. largest corporations, including the [[Bank of America]] and the [[New York Central Railroad]], can be found in [[David Karr]]'s 1956 volume, ''Fight for Control''.
*Stockholder dissidents opposed to an impending takeover in the view that it will dilute value may also use a proxy fight to stop it. An example of a proxy fight took place within [[Hewlett-Packard]], when the management of that company sought to take over [[Compaq]]. Opponents of the Compaq takeover lost the fight. The management, under [[Carly Fiorina]], remained in place, and the merger went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2002/03/20/fin_hp_declares_proxy.html HP declares proxy win]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the absence of any looming takeover, proxy fights can come about because dissidents are unhappy with management, as with [[Carl Icahn]]'s effort in 2005–2006 to oust a majority of the board of [[Time Warner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2006/01/31/frank-biondi-joins-carl-icahn-in-time-warner-proxy-fight Frank Biondi Joins Carl Icahn in Time Warner Proxy Fight] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218183834/http://dmwmedia.com/news/2006/01/31/frank-biondi-joins-carl-icahn-in-time-warner-proxy-fight |date=2010-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key players==
Due to their out-sized influence with many institutional investors, [[proxy advisor]]s play a key role in many proxy fights. In many cases, the proxy firms end up determining the result of the contest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/protecting-shareholders-from-activist-proxies-1432860067 Protecting Shareholders From Activist Proxies HP declares proxy win]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Re Taylor''''' is a leading [[New Zealand]] case on when the [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] will exercise its discretion and refuse to adjudicate a debtor [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]].

==Background==
The background to the application to adjudicate Mr Taylor bankrupt was summarised by [[Ted Thomas (judge)|Justice Thomas]],&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr Taylor's creditors, Mr and Mrs Greenwood, obtained a summary judgment against Mr Taylor on 17 April 1991 for $21,448.86. The [[summary judgment]] application had not been opposed. The judgment sum represented unpaid rent and outgoings for which Mr Taylor and his wife were liable under a lease which they had taken from Mr and Mrs Greenwood. The lease related to business premises occupied by Mr and Mrs Taylor's company. Sensitive readers liable to be easily disturbed should look the other way when I recite that the company went by the awful name of "Bath and Dunny Shop Limited". As befits its name it went down the drain, and it is now in liquidation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Following judgment, Mr and Mrs Greenwood were unable to obtain repayment of any part of their [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] debt. They sought execution against Mr and Mrs Taylor's assets, including their [[real property]], but the assets and property proved worthless, and there was no equity available for them or any other unsecured creditors. Consequently, on 16 March last, Mr and Mrs Greenwood issued a bankruptcy notice against Mr Taylor. It was renewed on 16 April 1992 and was finally served on Mr Taylor on 16 May.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Taylor'' (1992) 4 NZBLC 102,875.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Judgment==
The debtor, Mr Taylor, made an application in opposition to a [[bankruptcy]] notice. Although Taylor had no [[Legal technicality|technical]] grounds on which to oppose the notice, [[Ted Thomas (judge)|Justice Thomas]] held, &lt;blockquote&gt;For my part, I consider that adjudicating a person bankrupt when that person is essentially a victim of the current downturn in this country’s economy may, in certain circumstances, be unnecessarily severe. In Mr Taylor’s case I believe that the collapse of his business can be directly traced to the [[Rogernomics|political and economic developments]] which took place at the time. But for those developments, Mr and Mrs Taylor would probably have a thriving business today. Bankruptcy will not now realise one cent in the dollar for Mr and Mrs Greenwood. Moreover it is difficult to perceive any [[public interest]] element which would be served by making Mr Taylor bankrupt. He cannot get a job and it is unlikely that he will get credit. To make Mr Taylor bankrupt would be purely punitive and serve no practical or useful purpose. To my mind, sufficient cause exists for no order of adjudication to be made. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The only question, therefore, is whether the issue of bankruptcy should be left to be finally decided at the hearing of the petition, should Mr and Mrs Greenwood decide to pursue that course, or whether I should [[Stay of proceedings|stay the proceeding]] now. There is much merit in Mr Sadler’s observation that this proceeding should be brought to an end one way or another today. I therefore propose to grant a stay. In the event that Mr and Mrs Greenwood obtain evidence that Mr and Mrs Taylor’s fortunes have changed for the better it would be open to them to apply to the Court to uplift this stay. The debt as Mr and Mrs Taylor will appreciate, remains due and owing.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Taylor'' (1992) 4 NZBLC 102,875 at 879.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Significance==

The rule in ''Re Taylor'' is codified in the Insolvency Act 2006 which states that a court may at its discretion refuse to adjudicate a [[debtor]] bankrupt if "it is just and equitable that the court does not make an order of adjudication".&lt;ref&gt;Insolvency Act, s 37(c).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Romanian nationality law''' addresses specific rights, duties, privileges, and benefits between Romania and the individual.  Romanian nationality law is based on ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' ("right of blood").  Current citizenship policy in [[Romania]] is in accordance with the Romanian Citizenship Law, which was adopted by the Romanian Parliament on March 6, 1991, and the Constitution of Romania, which was adopted on November 21, 1991.

== Background ==
Romania was under [[communist]] rule between 1947 and 1989. During the early phases of communism, the principles of ''Jus Sanguinis'' were emphasized and a strong sense of [[nationalism]] was demanded of all Romanian citizens.&lt;ref name="Iodarchi2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Iodarchi| first=Constantin| title=Citizenship and National Identity in Romania: A Historical Overview| journal=Rgio: Minorites, Politics, Society - English Edition| year=2002| volume=13| issue=1| pages=3–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  International migration was rigorously controlled by the regime and the population was under strict observation.&lt;ref name="Iodarchi2002"/&gt;  The 1971 Law on Romanian Citizenship upheld these principles and expressed the superiority of Romanian citizenship. “Law No. 24 on Romanian Citizenship of December 1971 stipulated that descendants of a Romanian woman were automatically ascribed Romanian citizenship, regardless of the father’s citizenship”.&lt;ref name="Iodarchi2002"/&gt;  Article 5 of the Law reads: “As an expression of the relationship between parents and children, of the uninterrupted continuity on the fatherland of previous generations that fought for social and national freedom, children born from Romanian parents on the territory of the Socialist Republic of Romania are Romanian citizens.”&lt;ref name="Iodarchi2002"/&gt;  The law also stipulates that “the president of the republic alone, as representative of the executive power..." could grant or withdraw Romanian citizenship.&lt;ref name="Iodarchi2002"/&gt;

Economic and socio-political crises of the 1980s brought with it a change in understanding Romanian homogeneity.&lt;ref name="Iodarchi2002"/&gt;  Conflict arose between the Hungarian and Romanian nations and confusion between citizenship and national identity led to many questions regarding the boundaries of the nation and the rights of Hungarian minorities living in Romania.&lt;ref name="Iodarchi2002"/&gt;  After the fall of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989, citizenship laws in Romania were redrafted in the newly formed constitution.&lt;ref name="Iodarchi2002"/&gt;  Interactions between the citizenship policies of the various Eastern European countries led to new discussions regarding dual-citizenship, which had traditionally been forbidden for Romanian citizens.&lt;ref name="Iodarchi2002"/&gt;

==Current law's foundation==
Romanian nationality law is founded on the social policy of ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' by which nationality or citizenship is not determined by place of birth, but by the citizenship of one’s ancestor.  It contrasts with ''[[jus soli]]'' ("right of soil"), in which citizenship is determined by one’s place of birth.

In respect to foundlings, Romanian nationality law does contain an element of ''jus soli''.  Foundlings who are found in Romania are considered Romanian citizens until proven otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Article #5; Romanian Nationality Law; Law no. 21/1991; republished in 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The law==
From Article #5; Law 21 – The children born from Romanian citizens on Romanian territory are Romanian citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.romanianpassport.co.il/english/romanian-citizenship-law/| title=Romanian Citizenship · Romanian Passport » Romanian Citizenship Law | publisher=Romanianpassport.co.il | date= | accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Romanian citizens are also those:

* born on Romanian territory, even if only one of the parents is a Romanian citizen;
* born abroad with at least one parent holding Romanian citizenship.

Romanian citizenship can be acquired after four years of residency in the country while demonstrating a working knowledge of the [[Romanian language]] and knowledge of Romanian culture.

== Acquiring Romanian citizenship ==
Citizenship in Romania can be acquired by four methods: birth, adoption, repatriation, and request. 
* '''Birth''': All children born to Romanian citizens acquire citizenship at birth. The child may be born on Romanian territory or abroad and only one parent must be a Romanian citizen. Additionally, any child found on Romanian territory is granted citizenship if neither of the parents are known.&lt;ref name="passport"&gt;{{cite web | title=Romanian Citizenship| url=http://www.romanianpassport.co.il/english/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Adoption''': Citizenship is granted to any child who is legally adopted by Romanian citizens. If only one foster parent is a Romanian citizen, the child is still eligible for Romanian citizenship and the decision is made by the foster parents. If they are unable to reach a mutual agreement, the qualified court of law will decide. If the child is 14 years of age or older, their consent is necessary.&lt;ref name="passport"/&gt;
* '''Repatriation''': Any person who has lost Romanian citizenship can regain citizenship if he so wishes.&lt;ref name="passport"/&gt; Additionally, any child or grandchild of someone who has lost their citizenship is entitled to repatriation.&lt;ref name=Verdery1998&gt;{{cite journal | last=Verdery| first=Kathleen| title=Transnationalism, Nationalism, Citizenship, and Property: Eastern Europe Since 1989| journal=American Ethnologist| year=1998| volume=25| issue=2| doi = 10.1525/ae.1998.25.2.291 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Acquiring by Request''': Citizenship may be granted to foreign citizens or a person without citizenship who qualify by inclusion of one of the following three categories:
*Was born in Romania and currently reside there;
*Has resided in Romania for at least eight years; or
*Has resided in Romania and been married to a Romanian citizen for at least five years.
Applicants must also be 18 years of age and have a good understanding of the Romanian language and culture.&lt;ref name="passport"/&gt;

There are a number of qualifiers that may allow removing up to half of the time-requirements to gain Romanian citizenship, these include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/nationality/National%20legislation/romanian%20law%20on%20citizenship%202009.pdf|title = Law on Romanian citizenship - Council Of Europe|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher = Council of Europe|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the applicant is an internationally recognized personality
* the applicant is the citizen of a European Union Member State
* the  applicant  has  obtained  refugee  status
* the applicant has invested in Romania amounts exceeding 1.000.000 Euro.

=== The consequences of naturalization and restoration of Romanian nationality ===

Article #10 of the law stipulates that: "Romanian nationality can be granted to the person who lost this nationality and requests its restoration, keeping his/her foreign nationality..."

Certain countries do not allow for multiple citizenship or, in the case that they do allow it, they provide for automatic loss of their citizenship upon obtaining the nationality of another country through a voluntary decision (free choice).  The Romanian state cannot guarantee that the foreign citizen keeps his/her foreign citizenship when restoring his/her Romanian nationality. All Dutch citizens who restored their Romanian nationality before 1 April 2003,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minbuza.nl/en/services/consular-services/dutch-nationality/acquiring-a-different-nationality ''I would like to acquire another nationality''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407043820/http://www.minbuza.nl/en/services/consular-services/dutch-nationality/acquiring-a-different-nationality |date=2012-04-07 }}; Dutch Department of Foreign Affairs; accessed .&lt;/ref&gt; have lost their Dutch citizenship. All Dutch citizens who restored their Romanian nationality after 1 April 2003 and do not fulfill one of the three exceptions from the automatic loss of citizenship have lost their Dutch nationality. All adult Belgian citizens who restored their Romanian nationality before 9 June 2007 have lost their Belgian nationality.&lt;ref name="TEXTID42527"&gt;{{Cite web 
|url=http://diplomatie.belgium.be/en/services/services_abroad/nationality/losing_retaining_and_regaining/loss
|title=Losing Belgian nationality
|publisher=Kingdom of Belgium: Federal Public Service Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same applies to people who get naturalized as Romanian nationals.

This does not constitute a fault of the Romanian state, since "according to the Romanian Constitution and Article #1; paragraph 3; Law No. 21/1991 with the subsequent changes and additions, republished, the nationals of Romania enjoy the protection of the Romanian state — such provisions do not mention any duty of the Romanian state in respect to former and/or future Romanian nationals".&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.home.nl/icnl/multumiri.pdf ''Gratitude letter'']; from the Nationality Service of the Romanian Justice Department''; accessed .&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation of Dual citizenship led to many criticisms in the years that followed.  The policy was criticized for being both too inclusive and too exclusive. Some scholars argued that the policy attempted to uphold the principle in the Romanian constitution that “Romanian sovereignty belongs to the Romanian people,” by focusing its efforts towards ethnic homogeneity rather than diversity (Verdery 1996).&lt;ref name=Verdery1998 /&gt;  Contrarily, neighboring Eastern European countries claimed that the policy was a tool of “creeping expansion” and remained skeptical of the motives behind Romania’s new found inclusiveness.&lt;ref name="Iodarchi2004"&gt;{{cite book | last=Iodarchi| first=Constantin| title=The Hungarian Status Law: nation building and/or minority protection| year=2004| publisher=Slavic Research Center, Hokkaido University| location=Sapporo, Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the policy is still discussed today, Romania’s acceptance into the European Union in 2007 changed the focus on the citizenship discussion within Romania and with neighboring countries seeking acceptance into the EU themselves, criticism has dwindled abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Dura| first=George| title=EU membership gives Romania new opportunities in its relations with Moldova| year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Honorary Citizen ===
Article #40 of the Romanian Citizenship Law states: 
“The Romanian citizenship titled “honorary citizenship” may be granted to some foreigners for special services in favor of the country and the Romanian people, on the Government proposal, with no other formality, by the Romanian Parliament.  The persons who acquire honorary citizenship enjoy all the civilian and political rights that are recognized to the Romanian citizens, except the right of electing and being elected and that of carrying out a public rank.”&lt;ref name="passport"/&gt;

==Dual citizenship==
In accordance with the Law on Romanian Citizenship of 1991, Romanian citizens currently have the right to hold [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]]. Romanian citizens who apply for dual citizenship are not required to establish their residency in Romania and, if accepted, are granted all the same rights as non-dual citizens.&lt;ref name="passport"/&gt; The Romanian policy on dual citizenship is irrelevant to other states policy. In order to successfully become a dual citizen of Romania, a person must also meet the requirements of dual citizenship in the other country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Acquiring a different nationality| url=http://www.minbuza.nl/en/services/consular-services/dutch-nationality/acquiring-a-different-nationality| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407043820/http://www.minbuza.nl/en/services/consular-services/dutch-nationality/acquiring-a-different-nationality| archivedate=2012-04-07| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been cases in which applicants have successfully restored their Romanian citizenship and as a result, lost citizenship of another country. The Romanian state does not claim responsibility for the loss of citizenship to another state as a result of being granted dual citizenship by Romania.&lt;ref name="passport"/&gt;

==Citizenship of the European Union==
Because Romania forms part of the [[European Union]], Romanian citizens are also [[citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] under [[European Union law]] and thus enjoy [[Freedom of movement for workers#Transitional provisions in new member states|rights of free movement]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.migrant.ro/citizenship-law ''Citizenship law'']; updated Aug. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Romania (European Parliament constituency)|have the right to vote]] in [[Elections in the European Union|elections]] for the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/romania/index_en.htm | title=Romania | publisher=European Union | accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanianpassport.co.il/english/romanian-citizenship-law/  ''Citizenship restrictions'']; Romanian Passport online webpage; accessed .&lt;/ref&gt; When in a non-EU country where there is no Romanian embassy, Romanian citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.&lt;ref&gt;Article 20(2)(c) of the [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Part Two: Non-Discrimination and Citizenship of the Union#Article 20|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Citizenship_of_the_European_Union#Stated_rights|Rights abroad: Right to consular protection]]: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state). [[Antigua and Barbuda]] (UK), [[Barbados]] (UK), [[Belize]] (UK), [[Central African Republic]] (France), [[Comoros]] (France), [[Gambia]] (UK), [[Guyana]] (UK), [[Liberia]] (Germany), [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] (UK), [[San Marino]] (Italy), [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] (Portugal), [[Solomon Islands]] (UK), [[Timor-Leste]] (Portugal), [[Vanuatu]] (France)&lt;/ref&gt; Romanian citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in [[Treaties of the European Union|Article 21 of the EU Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF |format=PDF|title=Treaty on the Function of the European Union  (consolidated version)|publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Losing Romanian Citizenship ==
Romanian Citizenship can be lost by withdrawing Romanian Citizenship or accepting the disclaiming of Romanian citizenship. Committing serious crimes that harm the Romanian state, or enlisting in the army of a state that Romania has broken any diplomatic relations with, while abroad are both means for withdrawal.&lt;ref name="passport"/&gt;  A citizen can disclaim his citizenship so long as he is not being charged in a criminal case or owes some sort of debt to any individual or corporate body of the state.&lt;ref name="passport"/&gt;

Regardless of an individual's actions, Romanian Citizenship cannot be withdrawn if acquired by birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_2&amp;par1=1#t1c0s0sba5  ''Constitution of Romania'']; official translation on the Chamber of Deputies' website, Article (5).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel freedom of Romanian citizens==
{{Main|Visa requirements for Romanian citizens}}
[[File:Visa requirements for Romanian citizens.png|450px|thumbnail|[[Visa requirements for Romanian citizens]]]]

Visa requirements for Romanian citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of [[Romania]]. In 2017, Romanian citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 149 countries and territories, ranking the Romanian passport 21st in the world according to the [[Visa (document)#Visa Restrictions Index|Visa Restrictions Index]] &lt;ref&gt;http://visaindex.com/#.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Romanian nationality is ranked twenty-fifth in the [[The Quality of Nationality Index|Nationality Index]] (QNI). This index differs from the [[Visa (document)#Visa restrictions|Visa Restrictions Index]], which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition to travel freedom, on internal factors such as peace &amp; stability, economic strength, and human development as well. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.businessinsider.de/nationalities-with-the-best-quality-of-life-2016-6?r=UK&amp;IR=T |title= The 41 nationalities with the best quality of life |date= 2016-02-06 |website=  www.businessinsider.de |access-date= 2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rule of 1756''' or '''Rule of the War of 1756'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanforeignrelations.com/A-D/Armed-Neutralities-International-maritime-law-in-the-eighteenth-century.html Armed Neutralities - International maritime law in the eighteenth century]&lt;/ref&gt; was a policy of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], and later the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] that was promulgated during the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756-1763). It ruled that Britain would not trade with [[Neutral country|neutral nations]] who were also trading with the enemy. 

The rule was devised and approved by the British [[Admiralty courts]], which maintained that if a neutral nation were prohibited from a particular type of trade during peacetime, then it would also be prohibited from the same variety during wartime. The rationale behind this rule was that the neutral nation was aiding the enemy. The rule has never been ratified by international law.&lt;ref&gt;"France: Decrees on Trade 1793-1810."&lt;/ref&gt; 

The rule was one of the [[causes of the War of 1812]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Savelle, [https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=crhJ5-mbDygC&amp;pg=PA141&amp; Empires to Nations: Expansion in America, 1713-1824], p.141 (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

During the Seven Years' War, France and Britain initially fought over disputed North American colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Schumann and Schweizer, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The war became both a naval and economic battle, spreading throughout French and British colonies around the world. The Rule of 1756 was created to hinder all French trade to its West Indies colonies. In 1757 the London Chronicle estimated that French West Indies trade had fallen by 70% since the opening of hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;London Chronicle, vol. 1, no. 3 (6 Jan. 1757), p. 24b.&lt;/ref&gt; This 70% drop in trade was triggered by British privateering of French ships. France was not able to supply its West Indies colonies due to Britain's naval superiority and lock on trade routes. The French government in Versailles proposed that French goods be carried on neutral ships from the United Provinces or Spain. French goods would be able to reach their intended destinations and the neutral ships from the United Provinces or Spain. French goods would be able to reach their intended destinations and the neutral nation would benefit from participating in the exclusive market.&lt;ref&gt;Schumann and Schweizer, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; France was forced to remove the trade monopoly it had with its colonies and allowed other nations to supply them with goods. In 1758 the Rule of 1756 was amended to eliminate the loophole France had discovered. The Rule of 1756 was adjusted to its modern form permitting the privateering of all ships carrying French goods. British privateers received permission to act even more aggressively at sea and were granted permission to conduct searches of neutral vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Schumann and Schweitzer, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Effect on War of 1812==
In the years leading up to the War of 1812, France and Britain were at war. Tensions between these two European countries had arisen following the [[French Revolution]]. In 1805 the antiquated Rule of 1756 would be reinstated by Britain. American shippers had been taking advantage of the hostilities in Europe. American ports were used as a stopping point while shipping goods to French and Spanish islands in the West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;''Infoplease,'' "War of 1812: Causes of the War."&lt;/ref&gt; By stopping at an American port, the Americans could evade seizure under the Rule of 1756. Britain noticed this loophole and amended the Rule of 1756 with the Essex Case. In doing so, British seizure of American ships greatly increased.&lt;ref&gt;''Infoplease,'' "War of 1812: Causes of the War."&lt;/ref&gt; This heightened seizure put a real strain on Anglo-American relations and was a significant factor contributing to the War of 1812. France countered the Essex Case by creating its own version of the law, called the Berlin Decree.&lt;ref&gt;Walton and Rockoff, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; The Berlin Decree and Essex Case resulted in the seizure of nearly 1,500 American ships.&lt;ref&gt;Walton and Rockoff, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sheridan v News Group Newspapers''''' (''Thomas Sheridan v News Group Newspapers Ltd'') is a civil court case brought by [[Tommy Sheridan]] against the publishers of the ''[[News of the World]]'', which began in the [[Court of Session]] in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, on 4 July 2006. He alleged that the ''News of the World'' defamed his character through a series of articles in their publication.

Although Sheridan's case was upheld, he was later prosecuted for [[perjury]] for lies that he told the court and was subsequently convicted in ''[[HM Advocate v Sheridan and Sheridan]]''.

==Background==
Tommy Sheridan was a leading figure in the negotiations to establish the [[Scottish Socialist Alliance]] in 1996, which evolved into the [[Scottish Socialist Party]] (SSP) in 1998. He was elected to the [[Scottish Parliament]] in 1999 as a Glasgow representative of the SSP which he remained until he broke with the SSP in the aftermath of the court case to form [[Solidarity (Scotland)|Solidarity]].

He was the [[convenor]] of the SSP from its formation until 11 November 2004 when he was asked to resign from this post, by a unanimous vote of the Executive Committee (EC) of the SSP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4017047.stm BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt;

He later claimed to have resigned due to 'personal reasons' citing a desire to spend more time with his family. At the time of his announcement, his wife Gail was expecting their first child, and this was the reason Sheridan cited as being his primary motivation for resigning:

''"I cannot continue to be the party convener and be a proper father. We are entering uncharted waters, Gail and I. We are older parents, and we are excited but petrified. Since the announcement of Gail's pregnancy, it has focused my mind completely. We have been discussing this for some weeks."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4002299.stm BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt;

After this announcement, the ''News of the World'' ran a series of articles, alleging that he had committed [[adultery]]. Sheridan strenuously denied the accusations and quickly announced his intention to sue. The EC of the Scottish Socialist Party requested that he pursue a political rather than legal response to the allegations and declined to publicly back his court case.

As part of their defence, the ''News of the World'' demanded that the Scottish Socialist Party hand over all documents related to the executive meeting immediately prior to Tommy Sheridan's resignation. The executive Committee of the party declined and publicly requested that Sheridan abandon his court case. In refusing to hand over the documents, party policy co-ordinator [[Alan McCombes]] was found in contempt of court and jailed for 12 days, while the SSP offices and McCombes' private home were raided by [[Messenger-at-arms|messengers-at-arms]].

A stormy meeting of the SSP National Council fairly narrowly defeated a motion from the EC to continue refusing to hand over the minutes to the court, effectively supporting a request by Sheridan that they should be handed over.  It also voted to give him "full political support" in his defamation action.

== The trial ==
===Pursuer's case===
On 14 July an incident occurred during the presentation of the pursuer's case. Graeme Henderson, junior counsel for the pursuer, suggested to witness Ann Colvin that she had a conviction for credit card fraud. This was untrue, which led to the presiding judge warning Henderson that he had broken the [[Faculty of Advocates]]' code of conduct. As a result of the incident, Sheridan dismissed his legal team and represented himself thereafter.&lt;ref name="complaint"&gt;{{cite news | title = Sheridan judge in case complaint | work = BBC News | date = 2006-08-15 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/4796717.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 July, the ''News of the World'' editor, in evidence, confessed that the newspaper had changed parts of their story. This followed earlier evidence where the newspaper's journalist Anvar Khan admitted that parts of her story had been sensationalised to help sell her book. She altered her story admitting that the alcohol, drugs and spanking had been added.

[[National Union of Journalists]]' Scottish Organiser Paul Holleran admitted advising both Anvar Khan and Tommy Sheridan, both of whom were NUJ members on opposing sides during the case, though only Khan was primarily a journalist.  Under questioning, Holleran admitted to having passed on details of confidential discussions with Ms Khan - also an NUJ member - to Sheridan to assist Sheridan's case against the ''News of the World''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/5221032.stm BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt;

Six witnesses who had been at the crucial meeting were also called to support Sheridan's claim that the minute was not accurate in that he had denied visiting the swingers' club, rather than confessing as had been recorded.

===Defender's case===
The jury heard allegations that Sheridan had visited "[[Swinging (sexual practice)|swingers']]" clubs in Sheffield and Manchester and had engaged in an adulterous affair with another woman. Sheridan, who claims to be [[teetotalism|teetotal]], was also alleged to have drunk champagne during an extramarital liaison. Sheridan denied these allegations.

Allison Kane, SSP Treasurer, alleged in Court that Sheridan had admitted to a party meeting that the allegations concerning his private life were true, but that the newspaper would be unable to prove them. She told the Court that the controversial minute which the party had sought to withhold had noted this. [[Alan McCombes]], the SSP official who had previously been jailed for refusing to hand over minutes of a party meeting when required to do so as part of this litigation, told the Court that Sheridan had admitted to him that he had visited swingers clubs. According to the testimony of 11 SSP members who were at the meeting, including [[Colin Fox (politician)|Colin Fox]], [[Carolyn Leckie]], Allan Green, [[Rosie Kane]], [[Catriona Grant]], Keith Baldassara, Jo Harvie and Barbara Scott, Sheridan admitted to a meeting of the SSP executive that he had visited Cupids in Manchester.

Anvar Khan testified in court that, as well as having sex with Sheridan while he was married, she witnessed Sheridan engaging in group sex with Katrine Trolle, an SSP candidate in 2003, and Sheridan's brother-in-law. Trolle later testified that these allegations were true and that she had visited ''Cupid's'' swingers' club with Sheridan and his wife's sister's husband, where they indulged in group sex. Two of Trolle's friends also testified that they had met Sheridan in the home they shared with Trolle, and saw Sheridan go upstairs to her bedroom with her.

Two other women claimed to have seen Sheridan engaging in group sex in a Glasgow hotel on another occasion. One of these witnesses claimed to have been threatened by someone allegedly trying to protect Sheridan. These witnesses had attempted to sell their stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://election.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=811&amp;id=1013092006 Scotsman.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, 18 witnesses testified that they had either had sexual relations with Sheridan while he was married, witnessed him taking part in sex sessions or had heard him admit to visiting a swingers' club.

=== The judge's summation ===
On 4 August 2006, the judge commented in the course of his summing up that, due to the nature of the conflicting witness evidence, it may be necessary to investigate after conclusion of the case whether criminal charges should be brought against any witnesses for [[perjury]].&lt;ref name="verdict"&gt;{{cite news | title = Sheridan victory in court battle | work = BBC News | date = 2006-08-04 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5246378.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The verdict ===
Later that day, the jury of six men and five women decided by a seven-four majority and after three hours deliberation that Tommy Sheridan had been defamed. The ''News of the World'' was ordered to pay damages of £200,000. However, this was not paid to Sheridan, as the ''News of the World'''s editor [[Bob Bird]] immediately announced the newspaper intended to appeal the verdict on the basis that it implied "eighteen independent witnesses came to this court and committed monstrous acts of perjury".&lt;ref name="verdict" /&gt;

===Perjury investigation and Trial===
{{main|HM Advocate v Sheridan and Sheridan}}

In August 2006, Charlie McCarthy, an SSP spokesperson and former candidate, distributed to a number of newspapers an account of a meeting he claimed to have had with Tommy Sheridan where Sheridan allegedly made a number of comments about his personal life at variance with the evidence he gave in the court case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialistunitynetwork.co.uk/news/sspcourt15.htm Socialist Unity Network] - full text of the letter&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other activists also came forward to claim that Sheridan had held similar meetings with them, in particular allegedly admitting that he had affairs and attended sex clubs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/scotland/story/0,,1843620,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=19 ''The Guardian'']&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006, the ''News of the World'' released a videotape which allegedly taped Sheridan confessing to attending the club and admitting such to the SSP National Executive

On 2 October 2006, the [[Procurator Fiscal]] decided that there were grounds for an investigation into perjury, and instructed [[Lothian and Borders Police]] to proceed with one.&lt;ref name="probe"&gt;{{cite news | title = Perjury probe over Sheridan trial | work = BBC News | date = 2006-10-02 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/5400298.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 February 2007, ''The Herald'' reported that the [[Crown Office]] had asked [[Lothian and Borders Police]] to undertake a full inquiry after receiving a preliminary report,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.1206609.0.0.php Sheridan perjury investigators given go-ahead for full inquiry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929115621/http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.1206609.0.0.php |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was scaled up in May 2006, with the number of officers assigned to the case doubling to 20.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article1842857.ece Sheridan's wife faces perjury investigation] ''The Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October 2006, it was reported that the police had interviewed a member of the SSP and were intending to seize computing equipment that had been used to type the minutes of party meetings.&lt;ref name="seize"&gt;{{cite news | last = Gordon | first = Tom | title = SSP computers to be seized in investigation of Sheridan trial | work = The Herald | date = 2006-10-19 | url = http://www.theherald.co.uk/politics/72476.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130421101619/http://www.theherald.co.uk/politics/72476.html | archivedate = 2013-04-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further details regarding the progress of the investigation were reported in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' &lt;ref name="news.scotsman.com"&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/politics.cfm?id=380292007 Perjury police to quiz Sheridan witnesses]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Sunday Herald]]'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1267701.0.police_focus_on_sheridan_sex_trial_witness.php Police focus on Sheridan sex trial witness] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320070205/http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1267701.0.police_focus_on_sheridan_sex_trial_witness.php |date=March 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1300499.0.jersey_visitfor_sheridan_probe_police.php Jersey Visit for Sheridan Police Probe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033249/http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1300499.0.jersey_visitfor_sheridan_probe_police.php |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; during March–April 2007, suggesting that Lothian and Borders Police were investigating the evidence of several of the key witnesses in the case, and had reached a conclusion with respect to the disputed minute.

On 16 December 2007 Tommy Sheridan was charged with [[perjury]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5h_nozeIMfbfRmljRD8NxbKDNc51Q Sheridan faces perjury charges]{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}&lt;/ref&gt; During February 2008 six more people were charged with perjury; they were Graeme McIver, Jock Penman, Pat Smith and [[Rosemary Byrne]] (all members of Sheridan's new party [[Solidarity (Scotland)|Solidarity]] who had been at the disputed SSP EC meeting of November 2004) plus Sheridan's wife, [[Gail Sheridan (politician)|Gail]] and her father, Angus Healy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7245995.stm | work=BBC News | title=Three charged over Sheridan case | date=15 February 2008 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5iXqzDcM20Zxq2ugfP_767OM25PCQ Sheridan wife charged with perjury]{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7252672.stm | work=BBC News | title=Sheridan's wife on perjury charge | date=19 February 2008 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was estimated that the costs of this investigation could reach £500,000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1494291.0.sheridan_probe_to_cost_taxpayer_500_000.php Sheridan probe to cost taxpayer £500,000] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033212/http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1494291.0.sheridan_probe_to_cost_taxpayer_500_000.php |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is unclear how this compares with similar investigations into perjury allegations against less well known individuals. Sheridan has previously stated "the streets of Lothian must be crime-free if the police can devote time to harassing a family", following the charging of two with perjury, not to mention five others who "are my friends".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2008/02/20/gail-sheridan-charged-with-perjury-86908-20325008 Oh it's going to hit the fan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial of Tommy and Gail Sheridan started on 4 October 2010 at the Glasgow [[High Court of Justiciary|High Court]], before [[Lord Bracadale]], with a jury of thirteen women and two men. It concluded on 23 December. All charges against Gail Sheridan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-12020014 |title=Gail Sheridan cleared of perjury charges |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-12-17 |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; had been dropped on 17 December while Tommy Sheridan was found guilty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-12059037 |title=Tommy Sheridan found guilty of perjury |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-12-23 |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; of five of the original twelve perjury charges.

===''News of the World'' appeal===
On 11 August 2006 the ''News of the World'' had lodged an appeal with the Court of Session in Edinburgh&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;{{cite news | title = Tabloid launches Sheridan appeal | work = BBC News | date = 2006-08-11 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/4784383.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 13 February 2007 reported that a provisional date for the appeal hearing had been set in December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6358371.stm Newspaper's Tommy appeal date set]&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 September 2007 the appeal was suspended at the request of the ''News of the World'' until the inquiry into allegations of perjury is concluded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7013358.stm Sheridan court appeal put on hold]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of witness intimidation===
On 15 August 2006, Lord Turnbull wrote to the Faculty of Advocates about an allegation that Anne Colvin, a witness in the case, had a criminal record.&lt;ref name="complaint" /&gt; and on 4 January 2007 ''The Herald'' reported the victim of this allegation was refused permission by Sheridan to the results of the [[Law Society]]'s investigation into the matter&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130421095514/http://www.theherald.co.uk/politics/78028.html Witness not allowed to see results of Sheridan investigation]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 October 2006, BBC News reported that Grampian police were investigating a claim by Fiona McGuire, who had been a witness in the trial for the ''News of the World'', that she had received a death threat through the post. In a statement to the BBC, Mr Sheridan said: "I utterly condemn any threats to Fiona McGuire or any other individual".&lt;ref name="threat"&gt;{{cite news | title = Sheridan witness 'threat' inquiry | work = BBC News | date = 2006-10-10 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6036271.stm}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Helen Allison, a witness in the case, told police that she had been lured to a meeting where she was pressed not to give evidence.&lt;ref name="news.scotsman.com"/&gt;  The police have investigated staff at the sex club allegedly being offered bribes not to cooperate with the police inquiry into the court case&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1411859.0.police_investigate_bribery_allegation_in_sheridan_case.php Police investigate ‘bribery’ allegation in Sheridan case] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528192307/http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1411859.0.police_investigate_bribery_allegation_in_sheridan_case.php |date=May 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014 no formal action has been taken over these allegations.

===Appeal against Sheridan's defamation award (2016)===
An appeal hearing at the Court of Session in Edinburgh against the 2006 defamation award in light of Sheridan's later perjury conviction began on 10 May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-36257409|title=Bid to overturn Tommy Sheridan defamation trial verdict|publisher=BBC News|location=Scotland|date=10 May 2016|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheridan has continued to maintain his innocence in the perjury case, and to reject the allegations made against him, while counsel for the newspaper group wanted the verdict of the jury in 2006 to be "struck down".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-37132110|title=Appeal judges refuse to overturn Sheridan defamation verdict|publisher=BBC News|location=Glasgow|date=19 August 2016|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three judges in their written summary said that the jury had valid reasons for reaching their verdict that the ''News of the World'' had defamed Sheridan, even though they may have concluded that he had lied in court about "several matters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Simon|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/19/judges-refuse-news-group-appeal-against-tommy-sheridans-200000-d/|title=Judges refuse News Group appeal against Tommy Sheridan's £200,000 defamation win|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 August 2016|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Group Newspapers (now part of [[News UK]]) lost their appeal against the award of £200,000 damages to Sheridan on 19 August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brooks|first=Libby|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/19/news-group-loses-bid-to-repeal-tommy-sheridan-defamation-verdict|title=News Group loses bid to repeal Tommy Sheridan defamation verdict|work=The Guardian|date=19 August 2016|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/search-judgments/judgment?id=36331ca7-8980-69d2-b500-ff0000d74aa7 Opinion of Court of Session on the appeal&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5207">{{About||the Jewish funeral tradition of guarding the deceased until burial|Shemira|the Jewish religious law dealing with physical contact between men and women|Negiah}}

In [[Halacha|Jewish religious law]] (''halacha''), a '''shomer''' ({{lang-he|שומר}}, pl. {{lang|he|שומרים}}, '''shomrim''') is a [[Jew]]ish [[legal guardian]] entrusted with the custody and care of another's object.

The laws of shomrim are derived from the [[Torah]] in the [[Book of Exodus]] ([[s:Tanakh/Torah/Shemot#Shemot 22|''Shemot'' 22:6-14]]).  It is also discussed in the [[Talmud]] in the [[Bava Kamma]] (["First Gate"]) and [[Bava Metzia]] (["Middle Gate"]) volumes of ''[[Nezikin]]'' ([''Damages'']), which deal with [[torts]], [[usury]], and [[property law]].

There are four types of shomrim: &lt;ref name="Mishnah, Bava Metzia 93a"&gt;Mishnah, Bava Metzia 93a&lt;/ref&gt; an unpaid custodian, a paid custodian, a borrower, and a renter (''{{transl|he|shomer ḥinnam}}'', ''{{transl|he|shomer sakhar}}'', ''{{transl|he|shoel}}'', and ''{{transl|he|sokher}}'', respectively). Each shomer has distinct laws in ''halacha'' that apply to it. The two major factors that determine a guardian's liability are whether the guardian has the ability to use the item (i.e., a renter or borrower) and whether money is exchanged. In general, having the ability to use the item and being a paid custodian increase the guardian's liability, while paying for the use of something (i.e., being a renter) decreases the guardian's liability.

===Shomer Chinam{{anchor|Shomer CHinam}}===
A shomer Chinam (Hebrew: שומר חנם, pl. שומרי חנם, shomrei chinam), or unpaid watchman, is one who watches an item without receiving payment for his watching. Shomrei cḥinnam are liable only for damages that result from their own negligence. They must pay for damages that result from their negligence.&lt;ref name="Mishnah, Bava Metzia 93a"/&gt;

The shomer cḥinnam does not have permission to use the item he or she is entrusted with.

===Shomer sakhar===
A shomer sakhar (Hebrew: שומר שכר, pl. שומרי שכר, shomrei sakhar), or paid watchman, also known as a noseh sakhar (Hebrew: נושא שכר, one who receives payment) is one who watches an item in exchange for compensation. In addition to the obligations of the shomer ḥinnam, shomrei sakhar are liable if the item is stolen. Armed robbery is exempted from this responsibility, however, as it is considered beyond the custodian's reasonable control.

Shomrei shakhar are also liable if the item is lost or misplaced, even if the loss was not a result of negligence.

In addition to the paid watchman's heightened level of liability, in certain ways the shomer sakhar is expected to perform a higher level of custodianship. A shomer sakhar, for example, cannot watch an item in a way that would only protect it from a reasonable wind, but rather must watch an item in a way as to protect it from any possible wind, and the absence of such would make the shomer liable.

The shomer sakhar also may not use the item entrusted.

===Sokher===
A sokher (Hebrew: שוכר) is a renter. The liabilities of a sokher are the same as those of a shomer sakhar.

===Sho'el{{anchor|Shoel}}===
A shoel (Hebrew: שואל) is a borrower. The shoel is liable for the entrusted item in all circumstances, including those that are not the shoel's fault, known as Onsim (Hebrew: אונסים, sing. אונס, Ones). The shoel's only exemption is for damage resulting from the normal use of the item, for example if a borrowed ox dies as a result of normal plowing.

==Biblical sources for shomrim==
The gemara in tractate Bava Metzia&lt;ref&gt;94b-95a&lt;/ref&gt;
discusses the biblical sourcing of each of the categories of shomrim. The gemara concludes that Shemot 22:6-8 refers to the shomer ḥinnam, 22:9-12 to the shomer sakhar, 22:13-14 to the shoel, and 22:14 to the sokher.

==Becoming a shomer==
Generally, one must be willing to become a shomer in order to assume liability, and as such cannot be forced to watch an item. In certain circumstances, such as when one encounters a lost item, the Torah dictates that until the item is returned, the person assumes the liability and responsibility of a shomer sakhar.&lt;ref&gt;Bava Metzia, 82&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Shomrim's Oath==
In order for a shomer to verify the circumstances of the entrusted item's loss, shomrim are required to swear a group of oaths in [[Beit Din]]. The oaths required of a shomer typically include swearing how the item was lost, swearing that the shomer had not been negligent, and swearing that the shomer had not misappropriated the item.

{{globalise/UK|date=February 2015}}
'''Solicitor advocate''' is the title used by a [[solicitor]] who is qualified to represent clients as an [[advocate]] in the higher courts in [[England and Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]].

==Origin==
Historically, solicitors took conduct of [[litigation]], and undertook advocacy in the [[lower court]]s ([[tribunal]]s, [[Coroner's Court]]s, [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]]s, [[County Court]]s,  [[Sheriff Courts]]). They were not able to represent their clients in court in the higher courts: [[Crown Court]], [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], [[Court of Appeal]], [[Court of Session]], [[Privy Council]], and [[House of Lords]].  Instead, solicitors were required to instruct [[barrister]]s (in England and Wales) or [[advocate]]s (in Scotland) to represent their clients in court.

Section 27 of the [[Courts and Legal Services Act 1990]], in England and Wales, and section 24 of the [[Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990]], in Scotland, created a route for solicitors to qualify for a grant of [[rights of audience]] in the higher courts when they have sufficient training and experience, subject to passing additional exams.  The complex rules and regulations were relaxed in England and Wales by the Higher Courts Qualification Regulations 2000 so as to establish four main routes to qualify for [[higher rights of audience]]: development (training, assessment, and a portfolio of cases); accreditation (experience and an advocacy assessment); exemption (sufficient experience); and former barrister (called to the bar before 31 July 2000).  Higher rights of audience may be granted for the higher criminal courts, or the higher civil courts, or both.  In England and Wales, solicitor advocates wear a gown, winged collar and bands, and may also wear a wig in circumstances where they are worn by barristers.&lt;ref&gt;''Practice Direction'' (Court Dress) (No.4) [2008] 1 WLR 357&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland they wear a gown over business dress, but no wig, in line with other Scottish solicitors.

==Practice today==
Solicitor higher court advocacy has developed significantly since its first authorisation by the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. Although only a handful of solicitors acquired higher rights as the first batch of advocates in 1994, they included some of the most senior figures in the legal establishment of the time, such as Sir [[David Napley]], founding partner of Kingsley Napley. Approximately 4,000 advocates have since been authorised for crime, civil, or both. They represent a wide spectrum of experience.

Whilst there has been a steady growth of numbers in recent years, the bulk of the serious advocacy is still undertaken by solicitor advocates with many years of advocacy practice behind them. Some solicitor advocates have been working exclusively in higher courts for fifteen years (or longer if former [[barristers]]) and have developed particular specialisms, for example in regulatory and disciplinary work such as [[Andrew Hopper]] QC; in family work, such as [[June Venters]] QC; in [[extradition]] cases, such as [[Michael Caplan]] QC; and elsewhere in various parts of the criminal field, such as in [[terrorism]] work and [[fraud]]; e.g., [[Niall Quinn (lawyer)|Niall Quinn]] QC.

Solicitor advocates are regularly appointed to the ranks of [[Queen's Counsel]], albeit the numbers of applicants are relatively low. Solicitor advocates have also been appointed to the [[High Court Bench]]. [[Lawrence Collins, Baron Collins of Mapesbury]], a former [[Herbert Smith]] partner was the first appointee as a solicitor QC in 1997 before being appointed to the High Court Bench. In 2009 he was appointed to the UK Supreme Court.

The [[bar (law)|bar]] and Judiciary have been generally supportive of the growth of solicitor advocacy, asserting that the bar would not be threatened by individuals acquiring new skills and practices; and that the ethnic, gender and class diversity that this wider pool of advocates would bring to the profession would be welcome. But, in recent years the bar has found its work being reduced, partly as a result of [[Legal Aid]] cuts principally directed at solicitors' firms, and this has generally soured its opinion of the changes.

Instruction of solicitor advocates became more prevalent as firms saw the advantages of keeping work in-house without the need to instruct outside counsel. This pioneering approach is frequently seen across England and Wales, particularly in areas such as [[Birmingham]]. The previous monopoly of counsel in higher court advocacy led to complacency by some; late withdrawal from serious cases of the counsel of choice remain relatively frequent due to other work commitments. Occasionally this was accompanied by an attempt to foist upon both solicitor and client a new counsel with no previous involvement in the case. Practice choices such as these worked to the benefit of solicitor advocates, who had the advantage of appreciating the consequences of such behaviour and of knowing the client. Equally, the independent bar met with some limited competition from chambers of solicitor advocates, independent practitioners with common clerking and conference facilities who operated in a similar way to barristers, but with less aggressive clerking arrangements so that late return of briefs was relatively unusual.

Competition has led to criticism from the [[bar (law)|bar]] and judiciary of the extent of solicitor advocacy practised in the higher courts, particularly as solicitor advocates are regulated by the [[Solicitors Regulation Authority]] or [[Law Society of Scotland]] rather than the [[Faculty of Advocates]] or [[Bar Standards Board]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/breaking/view=newsarticle.law?GAZETTENEWSID=376254 Law Gazette - Breaking news&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Solicitor advocates have a Code for Advocacy which is almost identical to the Bar Code of Conduct. Criticism is levelled against solicitor advocates due to the possibility that Defendants' interests may not be best protected by an advocate who also works for the solicitors employed by the Defendant. The role of Counsel is to act as an independent party and advise the Defendant if the solicitor is not acting in the best interests of the client.  

===Scotland===
Despite these arrangements, which have been in place since 1994, there have been attacks on the principle of solicitor advocacy from some quarters, both north and south of the border. In the Scottish case of ''Woodside v HMA'' [2009] HCJAC 19,&lt;ref name="woodsidevhma"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Alexander Woodside vs Her Majesty's Advocate |vol=2009 |reporter=HCJAC |opinion=19 |pinpoint= |court=High Court of Justiciary Appeal Court |date=18 February 2009 |url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/search-judgments/judgment?id=549c8aa6-8980-69d2-b500-ff0000d74aa7 |accessdate=4 April 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[High Court of Justiciary|High Court]] in Scotland was critical of some aspects of practice by solicitor advocates. But, the appeal in question failed on a ground related to the allegedly "defective" representation of the solicitor advocates instructed at trial. The case dealt with the conduct of a trial over 10 years earlier. In any event the decision was welcomed by the Society of Solicitor Advocates, who suggested that it would be appropriate to have a review of all issues relating to rights of audience, including those involving the Faculty of Advocates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solicitoradvocates.org/newsarticle.asp?id=4178 |title=News, The Society of Solicitor Advocates |accessdate=2009-03-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224194535/http://www.solicitoradvocates.org/newsarticle.asp?id=4178 |archivedate=24 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At a [[Shareholders' general meeting|SGM]] of the Society of Solicitor Advocates on April 22, 2009, they passed a resolution in respect of consideration of the Woodside case. The resolution stated:

{{quote|
The Society notes the Solicitors (Scotland)(Standards of Conduct) Practice Rules 2008 and in particular the duties of independence, to act in the interests of their clients, to avoid acting where a conflict of interest arises, and to act only where competent to do so.

The Society also notes the Rules of Conduct for Solicitor Advocates 2002 and in particular the rules relating to the acceptance of instructions.

The Society also notes that it is desirable that common principles should apply in relation to the exercising of rights of audience by all practitioners appearing before the Court of Session and the High Court of Justiciary – section 25A(8) of the Solicitors (Scotland) Act 1980 – as are reflected in the Rules of Conduct for Solicitor Advocates and the Guide to Professional Conduct of Advocates.

The Society also notes the comments of the judges in the High Court of Justiciary in the case of 'Alexander Woodside v Her Majesty’s Advocate' [2009] HCJAC 19

The Society affirms
1. The resolution of the 2008 Law Society AGM to seek to repeal the Solicitors (Scotland) (Supreme Courts) Practice Rules 2003.
2. The duty of solicitors to advise their clients on appropriate representation before all courts.
3. The duty of both solicitors and solicitor advocates to act on behalf of clients independently, in particularly of their own interests or the interests of their colleagues.
4. The right of solicitor advocates to accept instructions to represent clients in all courts from solicitors with whom the solicitor advocates are in a business relationship.
5. The duty of solicitors to instruct such representation in court, including such combination of representation, as is appropriate to the circumstances of the case.

The Society therefore instructs the Council of the Law Society to promulgate rules repealing the Solicitors (Scotland)(Supreme Courts) Practice Rules 2003.
}}

The motion was withdrawn at the Law Society's AGM, due to the announcement that there would be a review of rights of audience generally, as requested by the Society of Solicitor Advocates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawscot.org.uk/media_centre/news_arch/news_29052009.aspx {{dead link|date=November 2013}}, Law Scotland, 29 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing workload and recognition of solicitor advocates has led to changes in the law profession. Some law students elect to train as solicitor advocates rather than barristers. The ''[[Law Society Gazette]]'' has noted that a number of [[solicitors]] decide very early in their careers to qualify as solicitor advocates.

=== Hong Kong ===
{{sect-stub|date=February 2015}}
The ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', a Hong Kong newspaper, reported that "[i]n 2013, only 15 out of 90 solicitors who applied to represent their clients in the higher courts were granted the status of solicitor advocates".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1705548/hong-kong-law-society-president-seeks-senior-counsel-status&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turpentine''' (also called '''spirit of turpentine''', '''oil of turpentine''', '''wood turpentine''' and colloquially  '''turps'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques |last=Mayer |first=Ralph |year=1991 |edition=Fifth |publisher=Viking |location=New York |isbn=0-670-83701-6 |page=404}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a fluid obtained by the [[distillation]] of [[resin]] from live trees, mainly [[pine]]s.   It is mainly used as a [[solvent]] and as a source of materials for organic synthesis.

Turpentine is composed of [[terpene]]s, mainly the monoterpenes [[alpha-Pinene|alpha-pinene]] and [[beta-Pinene|beta-pinene]] with lesser amounts of [[carene]], [[camphene]], [[dipentene]], and [[terpinolene]].&lt;ref name="k69"&gt;Kent p.569&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''turpentine'' derives (via [[French language|French]] and [[Latin]]) from the Greek word τερεβινθίνη ''terebinthine'', the feminine form (to go with the feminine Greek word for resin) of an adjective τερεβίνθινος derived from the Greek noun τερέβινθος, the name for a species of tree, the [[Pistacia terebinthus|terebinth]] tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Barnhart  | first=R.K. | coauthors= | title=The Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology | location=New York | publisher=Harper Collins | year=1995 | isbn=0-06-270084-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mineral turpentine]] or other petroleum distillates are used to replace turpentine, but they are very different chemically.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Stoye "Solvents" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2002, Wiley-VCH, Wienheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a24_437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source trees==
[[Image:PostcardTurpentineWorkers1912.jpg|thumb|A 1912 postcard depicting harvesting pine resin for the turpentine industry]]
[[File:CupGutterSystem.jpg|thumb|"[[Charles Herty|Herty system]]" in use on turpentine trees in Northern Florida, circa 1936]]
[[File:Chipping a turpentine tree.jpg|right|thumb|Chipping a turpentine tree in Georgia (US), circa 1906-20]]

One of the earliest sources was the [[Pistacia terebinthus|terebinth]] or turpentine tree (''Pistacia terebinthus''), a [[Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]] tree related to the [[pistachio]].  Important pines for turpentine production include: [[maritime pine]] (''Pinus pinaster''), [[Aleppo pine]] (''Pinus halepensis''), [[Masson's pine]] (''Pinus massoniana''), [[Sumatran pine]] (''Pinus merkusii''), [[longleaf pine]] (''Pinus palustris''), [[loblolly pine]] (''Pinus taeda'') and [[ponderosa pine]] (''Pinus ponderosa'').

[[Canada balsam]], also called Canada turpentine or balsam of [[fir]], is a turpentine which is made from the [[oleoresin]] of the [[Abies balsamea|balsam fir]].  Venice turpentine is produced from the [[western larch]] ''Larix occidentalis''.

To tap into the sap producing layers of the tree, turpentiners used a combination of hacks to remove the pine bark. Once debarked, pine trees secrete oleoresin onto the surface of the wound as a protective measure to seal the opening, resist exposure to micro-organisms and insects, and prevent vital sap loss. Turpentiners wounded trees in V-shaped streaks down the length of the trunks to channel the oleoresin into containers. It was then collected and processed into spirits of turpentine.  Oleoresin yield may be increased by as much as 40% by applying [[paraquat]] herbicides to the exposed wood.&lt;ref name="k71"&gt;Kent p.571&lt;/ref&gt;

The V-shaped cuts are called "catfaces" for their resemblance to a cat's whiskers. These marks on a pine tree signify it was used to collect resin for turpentine production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dailyyonder.com/totems-georgias-lost-turpentine-industry/2010/06/10/2788 |title=Catfaces: Totems of Georgia's Turpentiners &amp;#124; Daily Yonder &amp;#124; Keep It Rural |first= Tom|last=Prizer|work=dailyyonder.com |date=June 11, 2010 |accessdate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Converting oleoresin to turpentine==
Crude [[oleoresin]] collected from wounded trees may be evaporated by [[steam distillation]] in a [[copper]] still.  Molten [[rosin]] remains in the still bottoms after turpentine has been evaporated and recovered from a [[condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]].&lt;ref name="k71"/&gt;  Turpentine may alternatively be condensed from [[destructive distillation]] of pine wood.&lt;ref name="k69"/&gt;

Oleoresin may also be extracted from shredded pine stumps, roots, and slash using the light end of the heavy [[naphtha]] fraction (boiling between {{convert|90|and|115|°C|disp=or|round=5}}) from a crude [[oil refinery]].  Multi-stage counter-current [[solid phase extraction|extraction]] is commonly used so fresh naphtha first contacts wood leached in previous stages and naphtha laden with turpentine from previous stages contacts fresh wood before [[vacuum distillation]] to recover naphtha from the turpentine. Leached wood is steamed for additional naphtha recovery prior to burning for [[energy recovery]].&lt;ref&gt;Kent pp.571&amp;572&lt;/ref&gt;

When producing chemical [[wood pulp]] from [[pine]]s or other [[coniferous trees]], sulfate turpentine may be condensed from the gas generated in [[Kraft process]] pulp [[Kraft process#Cooking|digesters]]. The average yield of crude sulfate turpentine is 5–10&amp;nbsp;kg/t pulp.&lt;ref name="sten"&gt;{{cite book |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= Per |editor1-last= Stenius |others= |title= Forest Products Chemistry|url= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 3|date= |year= 2000|month= |origyear= |publisher= |location= Finland |language= |isbn=952-5216-03-9 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= 73–76 |chapter= 2 |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unless burned at the mill for energy production, sulfate turpentine may require additional treatment measures to remove traces of [[sulfur]] compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Kent p.572&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial and other end uses==

===Solvent===
The two primary uses of turpentine in industry are as a [[solvent]] and as a source of materials for [[organic synthesis]].  As a solvent, turpentine is used for thinning oil-based [[paint]]s, for producing [[varnish]]es, and as a raw material for the chemical industry. Its industrial use as a solvent in industrialized nations has largely been replaced by the much cheaper [[turpentine substitute]]s distilled from [[crude oil]]. Turpentine has long been used as a solvent, mixed with [[beeswax]] or with [[carnauba wax]], to make fine furniture wax for use as a protective coating over oiled wood finishes (e.g., [[tung oil]]).

===Source of organic compounds===
Turpentine is also used as a source of raw materials in the synthesis of fragrant chemical compounds. Commercially used [[camphor]], [[linalool]], [[terpineol|alpha-terpineol]], and [[geraniol]] are all usually produced from [[alpha-pinene]] and [[beta-pinene]], which are two of the chief chemical components of turpentine. These pinenes are separated and purified by distillation. The mixture of [[diterpene]]s and [[triterpene]]s that is left as residue after turpentine distillation is sold as [[rosin]].

===Medicinal elixir===
Turpentine and petroleum distillates such as [[coal oil]] and kerosene have been used medicinally since ancient times, as topical and sometimes internal home remedies. Topically, it has been used for abrasions and wounds, as a treatment for [[lice]], and when mixed with [[animal fat]] it has been used as a chest rub, or inhaler for nasal and throat ailments.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}  Many modern [[chest rub]]s, such as the [[Vicks VapoRub|Vicks]] variety, still contain turpentine in their formulations.

Turpentine was a common medicine among seamen during the [[Age of Discovery]]. It is one of several products carried aboard [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s fleet in his [[first circumnavigation of the globe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=[[Laurence Bergreen]] | title=Over the edge of the world : Magellan's terrifying circumnavigation of the globe | url=http://lccn.loc.gov/2003050143 | year=2003 |ISBN=0066211735| accessdate=2009-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taken internally it was used as a treatment for [[intestinal parasite]]s, but because of its toxicity, it should never be taken internally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/timeline/riseind/rural/remedies.html|title=Home Remedies - American Memory Timeline- Classroom Presentation|first=|date=|year=|publisher=The Library of Congress|author=|work=American Memory Timeline|accessdate=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics1063.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Niche uses===
* Turpentine is also added to many cleaning and sanitary products due to its antiseptic properties and its "clean scent." 
* In early 19th-century America, turpentine was sometimes burned in lamps as a cheap alternative to [[whale oil]]. It was most commonly used for outdoor lighting, due to its strong odour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Charles H. Haswell | title=Reminiscences of New York By an Octogenarian (1816 - 1860) | url=http://www.jmisc.net/octo/octo-17.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A blend of [[ethanol]] and turpentine called [[camphine]] served as the dominant lamp fuel replacing [[whale oil]] until the arrival of kerosene.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/this-post-is-hopelessly-long-w&lt;/ref&gt;  
* In 1946, [[Soichiro Honda]] fueled the first Honda [[motorcycle]]s with turpentine, due to the scarcity of gasoline in Japan following [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Honda History | url=http://smokeriders.com/History/Honda_History/body_honda_history.html |publisher=Smokeriders.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In his Book [[All Creatures Great and Small (franchise)|If Only They Could Talk]], vet and author [[James Herriot]] describes the use of its reaction with resublimated iodine to "drive the iodine into the tissue" - or perhaps just impress the watching customer with a spectacular treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Only-They-Could-Talk-Collectors-ebook/dp/B008I33ZWQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1530212880&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=if+only+they+could+talk|title=If Only They Could Talk|accessdate=28 June 2018|via=www.amazon.co.uk}}, summarised at {{cite web|url=https://jamesherriotbooks.blogspot.com/2008/08/if-only-they-could-talk-ch-3.html/|title=James Herriot Books|accessdate=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Turpentine was added extensively into gin during the [[Gin Craze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28486017|title=When gin was full of sulphuric acid and turpentine|first=Finlo|last=Rohrer|date=28 July 2014|publisher=|accessdate=2 January 2018|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hazards==
{{NFPA 704|Health = 1|Flammability = 3|Reactivity = 0}}

As an [[organic compound|organic]] solvent, its vapour can irritate the skin and eyes, damage the [[lungs]] and respiratory system, as well as the [[central nervous system]] when inhaled, and cause damage to the [[renal system]] when ingested, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Turpentine - Symptoms|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0648.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being combustible, it also poses a fire hazard. Ingestion can cause burning sensations, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, confusion, convulsions, diarrhea, and unconsciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics1063.htm | title = Turpentine | publisher = International Programme on Chemical Safety, World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because turpentine can cause spasms of the airways particularly in people with asthma and whooping cough, it can contribute to a worsening of breathing issues in persons with these diseases if inhaled.

People can be exposed to turpentine in the workplace by breathing it in, skin absorption, swallowing it, and eye contact. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the legal limit ([[permissible exposure limit]]) for turpentine exposure in the workplace as 100 ppm (560&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 100 ppm (560&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 800 ppm, turpentine is [[IDLH|immediately dangerous to life and health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Turpentine|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0648.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Pennsylvania Voter Laws==

If a citizen consistently votes in Pennsylvania, they do not need to re-register before the next election except to update information such as address, name, party if anything has changed. In order to become a registered voter in Pennsylvania, one must obtain US citizenship at least one month prior to the election date, be at least 18 years old by the next election date, and live in the district they will be voting in for at least 30 days prior to the election date. Those in prison for a felony are not permitted to vote, but one can vote if they are on parole or probation. To be eligible to vote, one must complete registration a minimum of 30 days prior to the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motor Voter Law|url=http://www.dmv.pa.gov/Information-Centers/Laws-Regulations/Pages/Motor-Voter-Law.aspx|website=Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently in Pennsylvania, no identification is required if it is not one’s first time voting, and they should not be asked to provide any form of identification. If it is one’s first time voting, or voting in a particular district, they will be required to show some form of identification. Acceptable forms of identification include: driver’s license; US passport; military, student, or employee ID; voter registration card; firearm permit; current utility bill, bank statement, paycheck or government check; any other form of identification issued by the commonwealth or federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voting in Pennsylvania|url=https://www.pa.gov/guides/voting-and-elections/|website=PA.gov|publisher=Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no documents are required to vote in Pennsylvania, voters are asked to provide their signature to verify with a signature kept on file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Underhill|first1=Wendy|title=Voter Identification Requirements {{!}} Voter ID Laws|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 Voter ID Law==

On March 14th, 2012, Republican Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett signed a Voter ID bill into law, after it had been passed by the Pennsylvania State Legislature. The Voter ID law would require everyone who sought to vote to have specified types of photo identification before they could vote. The bill was pushed for and passed by Republican legislators who claimed that the bill was imperative to preventing voter fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Connor|first1=Tracy|title=Voters Wrongly Asked for ID at the Polls in Pennsylvania|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/card/voters-wrongly-asked-id-polls-pennsylvania-n679791|accessdate=19 March 2018|agency=NBC News|publisher=NBC News|date=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, the Voter ID law was one of the most prohibitive in the entire country&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania's Voter ID Law Found Unconstitutional|url=https://www.aclupa.org/news/2014/01/17/pennsylvanias-voter-id-law-found-unconstitutional|website=ACLU Pennsylvania|publisher=ACLU Pennsylvania|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Critics of the law claimed that this would prevent groups such as the older population and minorities from voting as they would be less likely to possess or be able to obtain the kinds of identifications specified by the law. This was substantiated in 2014 when a 2012 video of then Majority Leader Mike Turzai was leaked. In the recording, he described the passage of the Voter ID law as a successful plan to help Mitt Romney’s chances of winning Pennsylvania in the 2012 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|title=Everything you need to know about the Pennsylvania voter ID fight|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2012/10/02/the-pennsylvania-voter-id-fight-explained/|accessdate=19 March 2018|agency=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also cited data from the Commonwealth that showed they had no evidence to corroborate the claim that voter fraud was a large issue as they had zero cases of a casting of a fraudulent vote on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania's Voter ID Law Found Unconstitutional|url=https://www.aclupa.org/news/2014/01/17/pennsylvanias-voter-id-law-found-unconstitutional|website=ACLU Pennsylvania|publisher=ACLU Pennsylvania|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Constitutional challenge ===

When the Voter ID bill was taken to court in 2012, it was initially upheld by Commonwealth Judge Robert Simpson. Judge Simpson did say that Mike Turzai’s comments about the law concerned him, but despite his concern, he decided to uphold the law because regardless of what burdens it placed on people, the verbiage of the law and its implementation applied its stipulations to everybody in the state. He also argued that although he did see how it could impose upon the liberty of the voters, he felt that the actual purpose of the law was fair and outweighed the costs of its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richey|first1=W|title=Why judge refused to block Pennsylvania voter ID law|agency=The Christian Science Monitor|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|date=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was then appealed to the Supreme Court, but sent back to Simpson who then issued a decision saying that the law would not be implemented for the 2012 election&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laslo|first1=B|title=Commentary: Real fraud is in Pennsylvania Voter ID law|agency=The Daily Record|publisher=The Daily Record}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Voter ID law while technically in effect was not enforced at polling places in 2012l&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania's Voter ID Law Found Unconstitutional|url=https://www.aclupa.org/news/2014/01/17/pennsylvanias-voter-id-law-found-unconstitutional|website=ACLU Pennsylvania|publisher=ACLU Pennsylvania|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A group of civil rights and legal organizations banded together to contest the law in court. Their goal was to have the law struck down by the 2012 presidential elections, as they felt the law was more about Republican advantage than preventing voter fraud, however it was not decided until 2014{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. The official lawsuit was Applewhite v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The group of rights organizations represented 10 plaintiffs, all of which would be prevented from voting in the 2012 presidential election if the Voter ID law would be allowed to remain in place. Vic Walczak, a representative from the Pennsylvania ACLU, argued on behalf of these plaintiffs and pointed out that people who will not be able to produce the necessary forms of identification mostly fit into two categories: annual income of less than $20,000 and not possessing a GED. Hispanics and women were also populations with large amounts facing difficulty with obtaining these proper forms of identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gaynor|first1=Gerren Keith|title=Coalition files lawsuit against Pennsylvania voter ID law|agency=New York New Amsterdam Times|publisher=New York New Amsterdam Times|date=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was heard by Honorable Bernard L. McGinley. McGinley declared the law to be unconstitutional, and that it placed unfair pressure on the rights of the citizen to vote and participate in elections as it required such specific forms of identification to cast a ballot, types of IDs that were not necessarily feasible for everyone to obtain or were equally accessible. He ruled that the law could not be put into action. In his opinion, he alluded to the fact that although the law did not specifically target people through its language, it would disenfranchise certain groups and people who had more trouble obtaining the necessary identification required under the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Applewhite v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Full Order|url=https://www.pubintlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Voter-ID-Final-Order.pdf|website=The Public Interest Law Center|publisher=The Public Interest Law Center|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGinley also said in his decision that the state’s argument that photo identification was necessary to prove people’s identities and protect the elections did not clearly show a link between photo IDs and safer, better elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malloy|first1=Allie|title=Judge strikes down Pennsylvania voter ID law, calls it burdensome|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/17/politics/pennsylvania-voter-id-law/index.html|accessdate=19 March 2018|agency=CNN|publisher=CNN|date=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fallout===
The decision in Applewhite v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania against the Voter ID law led to similar challenges to voter ID laws in Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berman|first1=Ari|title=Pennsylvania Ruling Shows the Problem With Voter ID Laws|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/pennsylvania-ruling-shows-problem-voter-id-laws/|accessdate=19 March 2018|agency=The Nation|publisher=The Nation|date=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the 2012 Voter ID law in Pennsylvania had been struck down in 2014, people were still experiencing problems with being asked for identification beyond their voter card when they went to the polls for the 2016 presidential election. There were several reports from people across the state that they had been asked for some form of identification that was not required under law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Connor|first1=Tracy|title=Voters Wrongly Asked for ID at the Polls in Pennsylvania|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/card/voters-wrongly-asked-id-polls-pennsylvania-n679791|accessdate=19 March 2018|agency=NBC News|publisher=NBC News|date=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
