Speaking on January 20, [[Naomi Klein]] said, "it is significant that it seems that Donald Trump is going after programs for violence against women." She stated she believes that it is important for people to demonstrate their concern about the new administration's "drive to denigrate women." She also said that it was important that the women who organized the march included a large number of [[women of color]].&lt;ref name="Democracy Now!"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2017/1/20/naomi_klein_on_trump_election_this |title=Naomi Klein on Trump Election: "This is a Corporate Coup D'état" |last=Goodman |first=Amy |date=January 20, 2017 |accessdate=January 29, 2017 |work=[[Democracy Now!]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126231120/https://www.democracynow.org/2017/1/20/naomi_klein_on_trump_election_this |archivedate=January 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinem commented "Our constitution does not begin with 'I, the President.' It begins with, 'We, the People.' I am proud to be one of thousands who have come to Washington to make clear that we will keep working for a democracy in which we are linked as human beings, not ranked by race or gender or class or any other label."&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt;

Ferrera stated, "If we – the millions of Americans who believe in common decency, in the greater good, in justice for all – if we fall into the trap by separating ourselves by our causes and our labels, then we will weaken our fight and we will lose. But if we commit to what aligns us, if we stand together steadfast and determined, then we stand a chance of saving the soul of our country."&lt;ref name="ABC 10 empowering"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/10-empowering-quotes-womens-march-washington/story?id=44948631 |title=10 Empowering Quotes from Women's March on Washington |first=Joi-Marie |last=McKenzie |date=January 21, 2017 |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=January 22, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121232335/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/10-empowering-quotes-womens-march-washington/story?id=44948631 |archivedate=January 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johansson called for long-term change: "Once the heaviness [of the election] began to subside, an opportunity has presented itself to make real long-term change, not just for future Americans, but in the way we view our responsibility to get involved with and stay active in our communities. Let this weight not drag you down, but help to get your heels stuck in."&lt;ref name="ABC 10 empowering"/&gt;

The youngest presenter at the Washington D.C. march, 6-year-old [[Sophie Cruz]], said, "Let us fight with love, faith, and courage so that our families will not be destroyed," and ended her speech saying, "I also want to tell the children not to be afraid, because we are not alone. There are still many people that have their hearts filled with love. Let's keep together and fight for the rights. God is with us." Cruz repeated her speech in Spanish.&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sophie-cruz_us_58839698e4b096b4a23201f6 |title=Watch 6-Year-Old Sophie Cruz Give One of the Best Speeches of the Women's March |last=Blay |first=Zeba |work=HuffPost |date=January 21, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123195052/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sophie-cruz_us_58839698e4b096b4a23201f6 |archivedate=January 23, 2017 }}Sophie Cruz speaks at the Woman's March&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
===Academics===
While the march aims to create a [[social movement]], Marcia Chatelain of [[Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching, &amp; Service|Georgetown University's Center for Social Justice]] commented that its success will depend on the marchers' ability to maintain momentum in the following weeks. "One of the goals of any type of march or any type of visible sign of solidarity is to get inspired, to inspire people to do more. And the question is, at the march, what kind of organizational structures or movements will also be present to help people know how to channel their energy for the next day and for the long haul?"&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Historian [[Michael Kazin]] also commented on the importance of a long-term strategy: "All successful movements in American history have both inside and outside strategy. If you're just protesting, and it just stops there, you're not going to get anything done."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/12/21/506299560/womens-march-on-washington-aims-to-be-more-than-protest-but-will-it |title=Organizers Hope Women's March on Washington Inspires, Evolves |date=December 21, 2016 |publisher=NPR |first=Alejandra Maria |last=Salazar |accessdate=January 23, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122172615/http://www.npr.org/2016/12/21/506299560/womens-march-on-washington-aims-to-be-more-than-protest-but-will-it |archivedate=January 22, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maine Representative [[Chellie Pingree]] said she would instead visit a Planned Parenthood center and a business owned by immigrants on Inauguration Day before going to Washington to appear on stage with other politicians who refused to attend.

[[Cyndi Lauper]] commented on Madonna's controversial speech at the Washington march, saying, "Anger is not better than clarity and humanity. That is what opens people's minds. When you want to change people's mind, you have to share your real story."&lt;ref name="The Wrap"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thewrap.com/cyndi-lauper-doesnt-think-madonnas-womens-march-speech-served-purpose-video |title=Cyndi Lauper Doesn't Think Madonna's Women's March Speech 'Served Our Purpose' |last=Fuster |first=Jeremy |date=January 26, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126174112/http://www.thewrap.com/cyndi-lauper-doesnt-think-madonnas-womens-march-speech-served-purpose-video/ |archivedate=January 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Voight]] called the march "destructive" and said it was "against the president and against the government". He was particularly critical of [[Shia LaBeouf]] and march participant [[Miley Cyrus]], saying "they have a lot of followers" and felt their stances were "teaching treason".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rare.us/rare-people/jon-voight-ripped-into-the-womens-march-and-two-big-name-stars-who-have-been-opposing-president-trump/ |title=Jon Voight ripped into the Women's March and two big name stars who oppose President Trump |date=January 25, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324053821/http://rare.us/rare-people/jon-voight-ripped-into-the-womens-march-and-two-big-name-stars-who-have-been-opposing-president-trump/ |archivedate=March 24, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Piers Morgan]], a friend of Trump's, stated the march was a reaction by women that "a man won" and that "At its core, it was about Trump-hating and resentment that he won and Hillary lost". He also felt that it was democratic to protest, but not due to the result of a democratic election. In response to Morgan's comments about the march, [[Ewan McGregor]] canceled his appearance on ''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]'', which Morgan was hosting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.harpersbazaar.co.uk/culture/culture-news/news/a39525/ewan-mcgregor-cancels-good-morning-britain-interview/ |title=Ewan McGregor cancels interview after Piers Morgan's Women's March comments |last=Alexander |first=Ella |work=Harper's Bazaar.co.uk |date=January 24, 2017|access-date=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4027">'''Abū Ḥarb al-Yamānī''' or, according to [[Ya'qubi]], '''Tamīm al-Lak̲h̲mī''', better known by his ''[[laqab]]'' of '''al-Mubarqaʿ''' ("the Veiled One"), was the leader of a rebellion against the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 841/42.

== Life ==
According to [[al-Tabari]], who preserves the fullest account of the events,{{sfn|Eisenstein|1993|p=279}} the uprising began when a soldier wanted to billet himself in Abu Harb's house during his absence. Abu Harb's wife or sister refused him entry, and the soldier struck her with his whip. When Abu Harb returned and was told what had transpired, he took his sword and killed the soldier. This act made him an outlaw, and Abu Harb fled to the mountains of [[Jund al-Urdunn|Jordan]].{{sfn|Eisenstein|1993|p=279}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1991|pp=202–203}} According to al-Tabari, he used a veil (''burquʿ'') to hide his face so that he would not be recognized, and thus he acquired his sobriquet of "the Veiled One".{{sfn|Eisenstein|1993|p=279}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1991|p=203}} It must be noted, however, that this sobriquet had a history of being used by leaders of revolts in the Islamic world, from [[Al-Aswad Al-Ansi|al-Aswad]] in [[Muhammad]]'s time to [[al-Muqanna]] in the 780s and the leader of the [[Zanj Rebellion]], Ali ibn Muhammad, later in the 9th century.{{sfn|Bosworth|1991|p=202 (note 593)}}

Al-Mubarqa, as he was now known, began to speak out against the injustices of [[Abbasid]] rule, and was quickly joined by many peasants. Soon he claimed to be an heir to the [[Umayyad dynasty]], and was proclaimed as the "''[[Sufyani]]''",{{sfn|Eisenstein|1993|p=279}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1991|p=203}} a member from the [[Sufyanid]] line of the Umayyad house, who in local prophetc tradition was supposed to arise and deliver [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], once the heartland of the Umayyad Caliphate, from Abbasid rule.{{sfn|Bosworth|1991|p=203 (note 596)}} In this guise, the rebellion spread and gained adherents even among the local tribal nobility. According to [[Ya'qubi]], the tribes of [['Amila]], [[Banu Lakhm|Lakhm]], [[Banu al-Qayn|Balqayn]] and [[Judham]] participated in the revolt.{{sfn|Eisenstein|1993|p=279}}

Caliph [[al-Mu'tasim]] dispatched an army under Raja ibn Ayyub al-Hidari against the rebels. Al-Hidari's forces were considerably outnumbered, and the Abbasid general wisely decided to wait until the harvest season, when perforce the bulk of al-Mubarqa's peasant supporters would disperse to their fields.{{sfn|Eisenstein|1993|p=279}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1991|pp=204–206}} In the meantime, according to the accounts of Ya'qubi, [[Ibn al-Athir]], and [[Ibn Khaldun]], al-Mu'tasim died, and the new caliph, [[al-Wathiq]], sent al-Hidari against Ibn Bayhas, another rebel around [[Damascus]]. Al-Tabari on the other hand places the rebellion and its defeat squarely within the reign of al-Mu'tasim, i.e. before his death on 5 January 842, and records Ibn Bayhas as an adherent of al-Mubarqa. The exact relation between the two uprisings is therefore unclear from the sources.{{sfn|Eisenstein|1993|p=279}} After vanquishing Ibn Bayhas, al-Hidari turned south and confronted al-Mubarqa's forces near [[Ramlah]]. The battle was a decisive victory for the government army, with al-Mubarqa taken prisoner and brought to the caliphal capital, [[Samarra]], where he was thrown into prison and never heard of again.{{sfn|Eisenstein|1993|p=279}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1991|pp=204–206}}

{{History of Berlin}}
The '''Berlin Crisis of 1961''' ({{lang-de|Berlin-Krise}}) occurred between 4 June – 9 November 1961, and was the last major politico-military European incident of the [[Cold War]] about the occupational status of the German capital city, [[Berlin]], and of [[History of Germany (1945–90)|post–World War II Germany]]. The Berlin Crisis started when the [[USSR]] launched an [[ultimatum]] demanding the withdrawal of all armed forces from Berlin, including the Western armed forces in [[West Berlin]]. The crisis culminated in the city's ''de facto'' [[Partition (politics)|partition]] with the [[East Germany|East German]] erection of the [[Berlin Wall]]. 

The [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]—the last to be attended by the [[Communist Party of China]]—was held in [[Moscow]] during the crisis.

==Background==
===Emigration through Berlin "loophole"===
{{Main|Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|Eastern Bloc}}
After the [[Soviet occupations|Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe]] at the end of [[World War II]], some of those living in the newly acquired areas of the [[Eastern Bloc]] aspired to independence and wanted the Soviets to leave.&lt;ref name="thackeray188"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thackeray|2004|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1945 and 1950, over 15 million people emigrated from Soviet-occupied Eastern European countries to the West.&lt;ref name="bocker207"&gt;{{Harvnb|Böcker|1998|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking advantage of this route, the number of Eastern Europeans applying for political asylum in West Germany was 197,000 in 1950, 165,000 in 1951, 182,000 in 1952 and 331,000 in 1953.&lt;ref name="loescher60"&gt;{{Harvnb|Loescher|2001|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1950s, the Soviet approach to controlling national movement, restricting emigration, was emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc, including East Germany.&lt;ref name="dowty114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until 1953, the lines between East Germany and the western occupied zones could be easily crossed in most places.&lt;ref name="dowty121"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the [[Inner German border]] between the two German states was closed, and a barbed-wire fence erected. In 1955, the Soviets passed a law transferring control over civilian access in Berlin to East Germany, which officially abdicated them for direct responsibility of matters therein, while passing control to a government not recognized in the US-allied West.&lt;ref name="harrison98"&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|2003|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; When large numbers of East Germans then defected under the guise of "visits", the new East German state essentially eliminated all travel between the west and east in 1956.&lt;ref name="dowty121"/&gt;

With the closing of the Inner German border officially in 1952,&lt;ref name="harrison99"&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|2003|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; the border in Berlin remained considerably more accessible than the rest of the border because it was administered by all four occupying powers.&lt;ref name="dowty121"/&gt; Accordingly, Berlin became the main route by which East Germans left for the West.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Maddrell, ''Spying on Science: Western Intelligence in Divided Germany 1945–1961'', p. 56. Oxford University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Berlin sector border was essentially a "loophole" through which Eastern Bloc citizens could still escape.&lt;ref name="harrison99"/&gt; The 4.5&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N7aUJ0z1gBpSAWDbLHwEbNqDp7sGodbXVvIRKNhQcD4/edit#slide=id.ga01456a75_1_0&lt;/ref&gt; million East Germans that had left by 1961 totaled approximately 20% of the entire East German population.&lt;ref name="dowty122"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss was disproportionately heavy among professionals—engineers, technicians, physicians, teachers, lawyers and skilled workers.&lt;ref name="dowty122"/&gt; The [[brain drain]] of professionals had become so damaging to the political credibility and economic viability of East Germany that closing this loophole and securing the Soviet-imposed East-West-Berlin frontier was imperative.&lt;ref name="pearson75"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pearson|1998|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berlin ultimatum===
In November 1958, Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] issued the Western powers an ultimatum to withdraw from Berlin within six months and make it a free, demilitarised city. Khrushchev declared that, at the end of that period, the Soviet Union would turn over control of all lines of communication with West Berlin to East Germany, meaning the western powers would have access to West Berlin only when East Germany permitted it. In response, the United States, United Kingdom, and France clearly expressed their strong determination to remain in, and maintain their legal right of free access to, West Berlin.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/berlin.htm|title=Berlin Crisis|last=|first=|date=|website=GlobalSecurity.org|publisher=|access-date=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With tensions mounting, the United States, United Kingdom and France formed a covert group  with orders to plan for an eventual response to any aggression on West Berlin. The planning group was named [[LIVE OAK]], and staff from the three countries prepared land and air plans to guarantee access to and from West Berlin.&lt;ref name="live oak"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_136184.htm|title=Code Name - LIVE OAK | publisher=North Atlantic Treaty Organization|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Soviet Union withdrew its deadline in May 1959, and the foreign ministers of the four countries spent three months meeting. They did not come to any major agreements, but this process led to negotiations and to Khrushchev's September 1959 visit to the US, at the end of which he and US President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] jointly asserted that general disarmament was of utmost importance and that such issues as that of Berlin "should be settled, not by the application of force, but by peaceful means through negotiations."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Eisenhower and Khrushchev had a few days together at the US presidential retreat [[Camp David]], where they talked frankly with each other. "There was nothing more inadvisable in this situation," said Eisenhower, "than to talk about ultimatums, since both sides knew very well what would happen if an ultimatum were to be implemented." Khrushchev responded that he did not understand how a peace treaty could be regarded by the American people as a "threat to peace". Eisenhower admitted that the situation in Berlin was "abnormal" and that "human affairs got very badly tangled at times." 

Khrushchev came away with the impression that a deal was possible over Berlin, and they agreed to continue the dialogue at a summit in Paris in May 1960. However, the Paris Summit that was to resolve the Berlin question was cancelled in the fallout from [[1960 U-2 incident|Gary Powers's failed U-2 spy flight]] on 1 May 1960.

==Escalation and crisis==
At the [[Vienna summit]] on 4 June 1961, tensions rose. Meeting with US President [[John F. Kennedy]], Premier Khrushchev reissued the Soviet ultimatum to sign a separate peace treaty with East Germany and thus end the existing four-power agreements guaranteeing American, British, and French rights to access West Berlin and the occupation of East Berlin by Soviet forces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, this time he did so by issuing a deadline of 31 December 1961. The three powers responded that any unilateral treaty could not affect their responsibilities and rights in West Berlin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the growing confrontation over the status of Berlin, Kennedy undercut his own bargaining position during his Vienna summit negotiations with Khrushchev in June 1961. Kennedy essentially conveyed US acquiescence to the permanent division of Berlin. This made his later, more assertive public statements less credible to the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kempe|2011|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the confrontation over Berlin escalated, Kennedy delivered a speech on ABC television in Washington, and broadcast nationwide in the US, where he reiterated that the United States was not looking for a fight and that he recognised the "Soviet Union's historical concerns about their security in central and eastern Europe." He said he was willing to renew talks, but he also announced that he would ask Congress for an additional $3.25 billion for military spending, mostly on conventional weapons. He wanted six new divisions for the Army and two for the Marines, and he announced plans to triple the draft and to call up the reserves. Kennedy proclaimed: "We seek peace, but we shall not surrender."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/JFK-Speeches/4th-Nixon-Kennedy-Debate_19601021.aspx|title=John F. Kennedy Speeches - John F. Kennedy Presidential Library &amp; Museum|author=|date=|website=www.jfklibrary.org|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same day, 25 July, Kennedy requested an increase in the Army's strength from 875,000 to approximately 1 million, an increase of 29,000 and 63,000 men in the active duty Navy and Air Force, respectively, and the authority to bring some reserve units into active duty. He also ordered that draft calls be doubled, and asked for additional funds to identify and mark space in existing structures that could be used for [[Fallout shelter|fallout shelters]], to stock these shelters with essentials for survival, and to improve air-raid warning and fallout detection systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{where?|reason=were these fallout detection systems and potential fall-out shelters marked in Berlin?|date=June 2017}}

Vacationing in the [[Black Sea]] resort of [[Sochi]], Khrushchev was reported to be angered by Kennedy's speech. [[John Jay McCloy]], Kennedy's disarmament adviser, who happened to be in the Soviet Union, was invited to join Khrushchev. It is reported that Khrushchev explained to McCloy that Kennedy's military build-up threatened war.

==The Berlin Wall==
[[File:Berlin Wall 1961-11-20.jpg|thumb|right|East German construction workers building the Berlin Wall in 1961]]

In early 1961, the East German government sought a way to stop its population leaving to the West. [[Walter Ulbricht]], First Secretary of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED) and [[Staatsrat]] chairman and thus East Germany's chief decision-maker, convinced the Soviet Union that force was necessary to stop this movement, although Berlin's four-power status required the allowance of free travel between zones and forbade the presence of German troops in Berlin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The East German government began stockpiling building materials for the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]]; this activity was widely known, but only a small circle of Soviet and East German planners believed that East Germans were aware of the purpose.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This material included enough barbed wire to enclose the 156 km (97 mi) circumference of West Berlin. The regime managed to avoid suspicion by spreading out the purchases of barbed wire among several East German companies, which in turn spread their orders out among a range of firms in West Germany and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kempe|2011|p=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 June 1961, two months before the construction of the Berlin Wall started, Walter Ulbricht stated in an international press conference: "''Niemand hat die Absicht, eine Mauer zu errichten!''" ("No one has the intention to erect a wall"). It was the first time the term ''Mauer'' (wall) had been used in this context.

On 4–7 August 1961, the foreign ministers of the US, UK, France and West Germany secretly met in Paris to discuss how to respond to the Soviet actions{{explain|reason=what actions?|date=August 2017}} in West Berlin. They expressed a lack of willingness to engage in warfare. Within weeks, the [[KGB]] provided Khrushchev with descriptions of the Paris talks. These showed that US Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]], unlike the West Germans, supported talks with the Soviet Union, though the KGB and the [[GRU]] warned that the US were being pressured by other members of the alliance to consider [[economic sanctions]] against East Germany and other socialist countries and to move faster on plans for conventional and [[nuclear armament]] of their allies in Western Europe, such as the West German [[Bundeswehr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.videofact.com/english/cia_kgb.html|title=Spy vs. Spy: The KGB vs. the CIA|last=Zubok|first=Vladislav M.|date=1994|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The West had advance intelligence about the construction of the Wall. On 6 August, a [[Human intelligence (intelligence collection) |HUMINT]] source, a functionary in the SED, provided the 513th Military Intelligence Group (Berlin) with the correct date of the start of construction. At a weekly meeting of the Berlin Watch Committee on 9 August 1961, the Chief of the US [[Military liaison missions|Military Liaison Mission]] to the Commander Group of Soviet Forces Germany predicted the construction of a wall. An [[Signals intelligence | intercept]] of SED communications on the same day informed the West that there were plans to begin blocking all foot traffic between East and West Berlin. The interagency intelligence Watch Committee assessment said that this intercept "might be the first step in a plan to close the border", which turned out to be correct.

On Saturday 12 August 1961, the leaders of East Germany attended a garden party at a government guesthouse in [[Döllnsee]], in a wooded area to the north of East Berlin, and Walter Ulbricht signed the order to close the border and erect a Wall.

At midnight, the army, police, and units of the East German army began to close the border and by morning on Sunday 13 August 1961 the border to West Berlin had been shut. East German troops and workers had begun to tear up streets running alongside the barrier to make them impassable to most vehicles, and to install barbed wire entanglements and fences along the {{convert|156|km|mi|abbr=on}} around the three western sectors and the {{convert|43|km|mi|abbr=on}} which actually divided West and East Berlin. Approximately 32,000 combat and engineer troops were employed for the building of the Wall, after which the Border Police became responsible for manning and improving it. To discourage Western interference and perhaps control potential riots, the Soviet Army was present.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On 30 August 1961, in response to moves by the Soviet Union to cut off access to Berlin, President Kennedy ordered 148,000 Guardsmen and Reservists to active duty. In October and November, more [[Air National Guard]] units were mobilised, and 216 aircraft from the tactical fighter units flew to Europe in operation "Stair Step", the largest jet deployment in the history of the Air Guard. Most of the mobilised Air Guardsmen remained in the US, while some others had been trained for delivery of tactical nuclear weapons and had to be retrained in Europe for conventional operations. The Air National Guard's ageing [[F-84]]s and [[F-86]]s required spare parts that the [[United States Air Forces in Europe]] lacked.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Richard Bach]] wrote his book ''Stranger to the Ground'' centred around his experience as an Air National Guard pilot on this deployment.

==Stand-off between US and Soviet tanks==
[[File:EUCOM Checkpoint Charlie Standoff 1961.jpg|thumb|right|American tanks face an East German water cannon at [[Checkpoint Charlie]].]] 

The four powers governing Berlin ([[Soviet Union]], United States, United Kingdom, and France) had agreed at the 1945 [[Potsdam Conference]] that Allied personnel could move freely in any sector of Berlin.  But on 22 October 1961, just two months after the construction of the Wall, the US Chief of Mission in West Berlin, E. Allan Lightner, was stopped in his car (which had occupation forces license plates) while crossing at [[Checkpoint Charlie]] to go to a theatre in East Berlin. The former Army General [[Lucius D. Clay]], US President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s Special Advisor in West Berlin, decided to demonstrate American resolve. 

Clay sent an American diplomat, Albert Hemsing, to probe the border. While probing in a vehicle clearly identified as belonging to a member of the US Mission in Berlin, Hemsing was stopped by East German police asking to see his passport. Once his identity became clear, US Military Police were rushed in. The Military Police escorted the diplomatic car as it drove into East Berlin and the shocked GDR police got out of the way.  The car continued and the soldiers returned to West Berlin.  A British diplomat — British cars were not immediately recognisable as belonging to the staff in Berlin — was stopped the next day and showed his identity card identifying him as a member of the British Military Government in Berlin, infuriating Clay.

US Commandant General Watson was outraged by the East Berlin police's attempt to control the passage of American military forces. He communicated to the Department of State on 25 October 1961 that Soviet Commandant Colonel Solovyev and his men were not doing their part to avoid disturbing actions during a time of peace negotiations, and demanded that the Soviet authorities take immediate steps to remedy the situation. Solovyev replied by describing American attempts to send armed soldiers across the checkpoint and keeping American tanks at sector boundary as an "open provocation" and a direct violation of GDR regulations. He insisted that properly identified American military could cross the sector border without impediments, and were only stopped when their nationality was not immediately clear to guards. Solovyev contended that requesting identifying paperwork from those crossing the border was not unreasonable control; Watson disagreed. In regards to the American military presence on the border, Solovyev warned:&lt;blockquote&gt;I am authorized to state that it is necessary to avoid actions of this kind. Such actions can provoke corresponding actions from our side. ''We have tanks too.'' We hate the idea of carrying out such actions, and are sure that you will re-examine your course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v14/d192%7cUS|title=Department of State-Office of the Historian-Foreign Relations of The United States-Berlin Crisis-1961–1962-Document 192|author=|date=|website=state.gov|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Perhaps this contributed to Hemsing's decision to make the attempt again: on 27 October 1961, Mr. Hemsing again approached the zonal boundary in a diplomatic vehicle.  But Clay did not know how the Soviets would respond, so just in case, he had sent tanks with an infantry battalion to the nearby [[Tempelhof International Airport|Tempelhof]] airfield.  To everyone's relief the same routine was played out as before.  The US Military Police and Jeeps went back to West Berlin, and the tanks waiting behind also went home.

Immediately afterwards, 33 Soviet tanks drove to the [[Brandenburg Gate]]. Curiously, Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev claimed in his memoirs that as he understood it, the American tanks had seen the Soviet tanks coming and retreated. Col. Jim Atwood, then Commander of the US Military Mission in West Berlin, disagreed in later statements. As one of the first to spot the tanks when they arrived, Lieutenant Vern Pike was ordered to verify whether they were indeed Soviet tanks.  He and tank driver Sam McCart drove over to East Berlin, where Pike took advantage of a temporary absence of any soldiers near the tanks to climb into one of them.  He came out with definitive evidence that the tanks were Soviet, including a Red Army newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kempe|2011|pp=470–471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten of these tanks continued to [[Friedrichstraße]], and stopped just 50 to 100 metres from the checkpoint on the Soviet side of the sector boundary.  The US tanks turned back towards the checkpoint, stopping an equal distance from it on the American side of the boundary. From 27 October 1961 at 17:00 until 28 October 1961 at about 11:00, the respective troops faced each other.  As per standing orders, both groups of tanks were loaded with live munitions. The alert levels of the US Garrison in West Berlin, then [[NATO]], and finally the US [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) were raised.  Both groups of tanks had orders to fire if fired upon.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

It was at this point that US Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] conveyed to General Lucius Clay, the US commanding officer in Berlin, that "We had long since decided that Berlin is not a vital interest which would warrant determined recourse to force to protect and sustain." Clay was convinced that having US tanks use bulldozer mounts to knock down parts of the Wall would have ended the Crisis to the greater advantage of the US and its allies without eliciting a Soviet military response. His views, and corresponding evidence that the Soviets may have backed down following this action, support a more critical assessment of Kennedy's decisions during the crisis and his willingness to accept the Wall as the best solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kempe|2011|pp=474–476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With KGB spy [[Georgi Bolshakov]] serving as the primary channel of communication, Khrushchev and Kennedy agreed to reduce tensions by withdrawing the tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kempe|2011|pp=478–479}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet checkpoint had direct communications to [[Anatoly Gribkov|General Anatoly Gribkov]] at the Soviet Army High Command, who in turn was on the phone to Khrushchev. The US checkpoint contained a Military Police officer on the telephone to the HQ of the US Military Mission in Berlin, which in turn was in communication with the White House. Kennedy offered to go easy over Berlin in the future in return for the Soviets removing their tanks first. The Soviets agreed. Kennedy stated concerning the Wall: "It's not a very nice solution, but a wall is a hell of a lot better than a war."&lt;ref&gt;Gaddis, John Lewis, ''The Cold War: A New History'' (2005), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Soviet tank moved about 5 metres backwards first; then an American tank followed suit.  One by one the tanks withdrew.  But General [[Bruce C. Clarke]], then the Commander-in-Chief (CINC) of [[US Army Europe]] (USAREUR), was said to have been concerned about Clay's conduct{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} and Clay returned to the United States in May 1962.  Gen. Clarke's assessment may have been incomplete, however: Clay's firmness had a great effect on the German population, led by West Berlin Mayor [[Willy Brandt]] and West German [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Konrad Adenauer]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==History==
The Berlin International Film Festival was founded in West Berlin in 1951, with film historian Dr. Alfred Bauer as its first director, a position he would hold until 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive 1951: The beginnings|url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1951/01_jahresblatt_1951/01_Jahresblatt_1951.html|website=berlinale.de|publisher=Berlinale Press Office|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred Hitchcock’s ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' opened the first festival which ran from June 6-17th.  

Bauer was succeeded by film journalist Wolf Donner in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive 1977: A promising start for Wolf Donner|url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1977/01_jahresblatt_1977/01_Jahresblatt_1977.html|website=berlinale.de|publisher=Berlinale Press Office|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his first Berlinale in June 1977, he successfully negotiated the shift of the festival from the summer to February (February 22nd - March 5th 1978), a change which has remained ever since.

After only three years in the role, Donner was followed by [[Moritz de Hadeln]] who held the position from 1980 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive 1980: Moritz de Hadeln's first year: Consequent Renewal|url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1980/01_jahresblatt_1980/01_Jahresblatt_1980.html|website=berlinale.de|publisher=Berlinale Press Office|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; until current director [[Dieter Kosslick]] took over in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive 2002: All remains new|url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2002/01_jahresblatt_2002/01_Jahresblatt_2002.html|website=berlinale.de|publisher=Berlinale Press Office|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Festival programme ==
[[File:Berlin night.jpg|thumb|Venues of the festival are spread throughout the central city districts]]
[[File:Berlinale2007.jpg|thumb|The Berlinale Palast is the venue for the competition premieres]]

The festival is composed of seven different film sections.&lt;ref name="berlinale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/festival-sektionen/ueberblick_sektionen/index.html|title=The Festival Sections: An Overview|author=Berlinale.de|year=2010|accessdate=7 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208060420/http://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/festival-sektionen/ueberblick_sektionen/index.html|archive-date=8 February 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films are chosen in each category by a section director with the advice of a committee of film experts. Categories include:

'''Competition''': comprises feature-length films yet to be released outside their country of origin. Films in the Competition section compete for several prizes, including the top [[Golden Bear]] for the best film and a series of Silver Bears for acting, writing and production.&lt;ref name="compberlinale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/service/_filmanmeldung/richtlinien_wettbewerb/index.html|title=Competition|author=Berlinale.de|year=2010|accessdate=7 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212153111/http://www.berlinale.de/en/service/_filmanmeldung/richtlinien_wettbewerb/index.html|archive-date=12 February 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Panorama''': comprises new independent and arthouse films that deal with "controversial subjects or unconventional aesthetic styles". Films in the category are intended to provoke discussion, and have historically involved themes such as [[LGBT]] issues.&lt;ref name="panoramaberlinale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/festival-sektionen/panorama/index.html|title=Panorama|author=Berlinale.de|year=2010|accessdate=7 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208232103/http://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/festival-sektionen/panorama/index.html|archive-date=8 February 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forum''': comprises experimental and documentary films from around the world with a particular emphasis on screening works by younger filmmakers. There are no format or genre restrictions, and films in the Forum do not compete for awards.&lt;ref name="forumberlinale"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/festival-sektionen/forum/index.html|title=Forum|author=Berlinale.de|year=2010 |accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Generation''': comprises a mixture of short and feature-length films aimed at children and youths. Films in the Generation section compete in two sub-categories: Generation Kplus (aimed at those aged four and above) and Generation 14plus (aimed at those aged fourteen and above). Awards in the section are determined by three separate juries—the Children's Jury, the Youth Jury and an international jury of experts—whose decisions are made independent of one another.&lt;ref name="genberlinale"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/festival-sektionen/generation/index.html|title=Generation|author=Berlinale.de|year=2010 |accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perspektive Deutsches Kino''': comprises a wide variety of German films, with an emphasis on highlighting current trends in German cinema. There are few entry requirements, enabling emerging filmmakers to display their work to domestic and international audiences.&lt;ref name="persberlinale"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/service/_filmanmeldung/richtlinien_perspektive_dt_kino/index.html|title=Perspektive Deutsches Kino|author=Berlinale.de|year=2010 |accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Berlinale Shorts''': comprises domestic and international short films, especially those that demonstrate innovative approaches to filmmaking. Films in the category compete for the Golden Bear for the best short film, as well as a jury-nominated Silver Bear.&lt;ref name="shortsberlinale"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/service/_filmanmeldung/richtlinien_kurzfilme/index.html|title=Berlinale Shorts|author=Berlinale.de|year=2010 |accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Retrospective''': comprises classic films previously shown at the Berlinale, with films collated from the Competition, Forum, Panorama and Generation categories. Each year, the Retrospective section is dedicated to important themes or filmmakers. The special Homage series similarly examines past cinema, with a focus on honouring the life work of directors and actors.&lt;ref name="retberlinale"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/festival-sektionen/retrospektive/index.html|title=Retrospective &amp; Homage|author=Berlinale.de|year=2010 |accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the seven sections, the Berlinale also contains several linked "curated special series", including the Berlinale Special, Gala Special, Forum 5, Culinary Cinema and the Homage.&lt;ref name="berlinale" /&gt; Since 2002 a 50-second trailer opens the performances in all sections of the festival with the exception of the Retrospective.

In 1965 a special film award for the runner-up to the Golden Bear was introduced. Although its official name was the ''Special Jury Price'' from 1965 to 1999, and has been the ''Jury Grand Prix'' since 2000, it is commonly known as the Silver Bear (just like the awards for individual achievements) as it is regarded as a second place award after the Golden Bear.

In 1978, a Silver Bear for special recognitions was introduced, in 2002 a Silver Bear for best film music, and in 2008 an award for best screenplay.

== European Film Market ==
[[File:Gropius Bau Berlin 1.jpg|thumb|left| The European Film Market takes place at the [[Martin-Gropius-Bau]].]]
The European Film Market (EFM) is one of three largest movie markets in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kodak.com/US/en/motion/about/news/berlin08.jhtml?id=0.1.4.5.4&amp;lc=en Kodak Cinema&amp;Television Press Release], www.kodak.com&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the business centre during the time of the Berlinale Film Festival. The EFM is the major venue for film producers, buyers, financiers, sales agents, and distributors. It is a professional trade event, so is open to registered industry insiders. In 2011, 400 companies registered and 6,982 market badges were issued; 1,532 buyers have registered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efm-berlinale.de/en/about_efm/profile/facts_figures/Facts_and_Figures.php EFM Facts and Figures], 14. November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The trade fair provides exhibition space for companies presenting their current line-up. It organizes over 1000 screenings of new films, which take place at movie theatres around Potsdamer Platz. In 2007, the CinemaxX and CineStar were used to showcase new productions. In 2010, the Astor Film Lounge showed market screenings in three dimensions using digital RealD technology.

The Berlinale Co-Production Market is a three-day networking platform for producers and financiers, as well as broadcasting and funding representatives who are participating in international co-productions. At the Berlinale Co-Production Market, producers can introduce selected projects and find co-production partners and/or financiers in one-on-one meetings.

== Berlinale Talents ==
[[File:Wendersinterview.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Wim Wenders]] attended the Talent Campus as a lecturer]]
{{main|Berlinale Talents}}
Commencing in 2003, the Berlinale has partnered with the [[Berlinale Talents]] (previously Berlinale Talent Campus), which is a winter school for "up-and-coming filmmakers" that takes place at the same time as the festival. The Talent Campus accepts about 250 applicants each year; the attendees come from around the world, and represent all of the filmmaking professions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berlinale-talents.de Berlinale Talents], berlinale-talentcampus&lt;/ref&gt;

The event runs six days during the Berlinale and features lectures and panel discussions with well-known professionals addressing issues in filmmaking. Workshops, excursions, personal tutoring, coaching, and training of participants from different fields of work are part of the programme.

The proceedings include presentations by distinguished experts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117979620.html?categoryId=1061&amp;cs=1 Talent Campus adds to lineup], Variety&lt;/ref&gt; who have included [[Park Chan-wook]], [[Frances McDormand]], [[Stephen Frears]], [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Jia Zhangke]], [[Walter Murch]], [[Shah Rukh Khan]], [[Joshua Oppenheimer]], [[Anthony Minghella]], [[Charlotte Rampling]], [[Walter Salles]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Raoul Peck]], [[Tom Tykwer]], [[Mike Leigh]], [[Tilda Swinton]], and [[Wim Wenders]].{{cn|date=February 2018}} Many of these presentations and lectures are archived, both as video recordings and as transcripts, on the Talent Campus' website.

The '''Commodore Cup''' was an [[Australia]]n [[motor racing]] series. A [[One-Design|one-make]] series originally devised by Victorian racers Maurie Platt and David Gittus, it was named for the car all competitors were required to use in competition, the [[Holden Commodore]].

The category has always been a national series, but also mostly an amateur series. Despite this, the category has produced a [[V8 Supercars|V8 Supercar]] race winner in [[Lee Holdsworth]]. The category was one of the core categories of the [[Shannons Nationals Motor Racing Championships]]. The most successful driver in the series has been Geoff Emery, who has won the Commodore Cup series five times.

Eligibility was limited to specific Commodore models. Originally, only the first three series were allowed: [[Holden VB Commodore|VB]], [[Holden VC Commodore|VC]] and [[Holden VH Commodore|VH]]. Motive power was limited to the 4.2-litre version of the [[Holden V8 engine]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.camsmanual.com.au/sportregs/2010_Sports_Sedan_SportRegs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The regulations were designed to provide a limited level of performance modification, while not making the category overly expensive to run. The first season was held in 1994. Since its beginning, the category has always been moderately well supported with grid sizes in the 15–25 bracket.

The first major change to series regulations came in 2004 when [[Holden VR Commodore|VR]] and [[Holden VS Commodore|VS]] model Commodores were made eligible. The mechanical package was not changed substantially. The later model cars proved to be faster than the older ones, leading to a drop off in numbers of the older model Commodores.

In November 2012, it was announced that the series would fold due to consistently small entry numbers during the season. The cars themselves are still eligible for [[Group 3J Improved Production Cars|Improved Production]] classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2012/11/22/commodore-cup-set-for-last-blast-at-sandown/ | title=Commodore Cup set for last blast at Sandown | work=SpeedCafe | last=Rowley | first=Grant | date=22 November 2012 | accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cottingley Fairies 1.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=photo|The first of the five photographs, taken by Elsie Wright in 1917, shows Frances Griffiths with the alleged fairies.]]
The '''Cottingley Fairies''' appear in a series of five [[Photograph|photographs]] taken by Elsie Wright (1901–1988) and Frances Griffiths (1907–1986), two young cousins who lived in [[Cottingley, Bradford|Cottingley]], near [[Bradford]] in England. In 1917, when the first two photographs were taken, Elsie was 16 years old and Frances was 9. The pictures came to the attention of writer [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], who used them to illustrate an article on [[fairy|fairies]] he had been commissioned to write for the Christmas 1920 edition of ''[[Strand Magazine|The Strand Magazine]]''. Doyle, as a [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|spiritualist]], was enthusiastic about the photographs, and interpreted them as clear and visible evidence of [[psychic]] phenomena. Public reaction was mixed; some accepted the images as genuine, others believed that they had been faked.

Interest in the Cottingley Fairies gradually declined after 1921. Both girls married and lived abroad for a time after they grew up, yet the photographs continued to hold the public imagination. In 1966 a reporter from the ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper traced Elsie, who had by then returned to the UK. Elsie left open the possibility that she believed she had photographed her thoughts, and the media once again became interested in the story.

In the early 1980s Elsie and Frances admitted that the photographs were faked, using cardboard cutouts of fairies copied from a popular children's book of the time, but Frances maintained that the fifth and final photograph was genuine. The photographs and two of the cameras used are on display in the [[National Science and Media Museum]] in [[Bradford]], England.

==1917 photographs==
[[File:CottingleyBeck.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Photo|Cottingley Beck, where Frances and Elsie claimed to have seen the fairies]]
In mid-1917 nine-year-old Frances Griffiths and her mother—both newly arrived in the UK from South Africa—were staying with Frances' aunt, Elsie Wright's mother, in the village of [[Cottingley, Bradford|Cottingley]] in West Yorkshire; Elsie was then 16 years old. The two girls often played together beside the beck (stream) at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers' annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes. Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies, and to prove it, Elsie borrowed her father's camera, a Midg [[Film format#Still photography film formats|quarter-plate]]. The girls returned about 30&amp;nbsp;minutes later, "triumphant".{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|pp=97–98|ps=none}}

Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the [[photographic plate]] he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=on|disp=x|-tall (|)}} gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be "nothing but a prank",{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|p=97|ps=none}} and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again.{{sfnp|Prashad|2008|p=42|ps=none}} His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic.{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|p=97|ps=none}}

{{Quote box |width=25em |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=left |quote=I am learning French, Geometry, Cookery and Algebra at school now. Dad came home from France the other week after being there ten months, and we all think the war will be over in a few days&amp;nbsp;... I am sending two photos, both of me, one of me in a bathing costume in our back yard, while the other is me with some fairies. Elsie took that one.|source=Letter from Frances Griffiths to a friend in South Africa{{sfnp|Prashad|2008|p=40|ps=none}}}}

Towards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in [[Cape Town]], South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies. On the back she wrote "It is funny, I never used to see them in Africa. It must be too hot for them there."{{sfnp|Prashad|2008|p=40|ps=none}}

The photographs became public in mid-1919, after Elsie's mother attended a meeting of the [[Theosophical Society]] in Bradford. The lecture that evening was on "fairy life", and at the end of the meeting Polly Wright showed the two fairy photographs taken by her daughter and niece to the speaker. As a result, the photographs were displayed at the society's annual conference in [[Harrogate]], held a few months later. There they came to the attention of a leading member of the society, Edward Gardner.{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|pp=98–99|ps=none}} One of the central beliefs of theosophy is that humanity is undergoing a cycle of evolution, towards increasing "perfection", and Gardner recognised the potential significance of the photographs for the movement:
{{quote|... the fact that two young girls had not only been able to see fairies, which others had done, but had actually for the first time ever been able to materialise them at a density sufficient for their images to be recorded on a photographic plate, meant that it was possible that the next cycle of evolution was underway.{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=382|ps=none}}}}

==Initial examinations==
Gardner sent the prints along with the original glass-plate negatives to Harold Snelling, a photography expert. Snelling's opinion was that "the two negatives are entirely genuine, unfaked photographs&amp;nbsp;... [with] no trace whatsoever of studio work involving card or paper models".{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|p=99|ps=none}}&lt;!--important to retain the big difference between unretouched and 'showing faries'--&gt; He did not go so far as to say that the photographs showed fairies, stating only that "these are straight forward photographs of whatever was in front of the camera at the time".{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=389|ps=none}} Gardner had the prints "clarified" by Snelling, and new negatives produced, "more conducive to printing",{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|pp=98–99|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=382|ps=none}} for use in the illustrated lectures he gave around the UK.{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=382|ps=none}} Snelling supplied the photographic prints which were available for sale at Gardner's lectures.{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=401|ps=none}}&lt;ref name=crawley/&gt;

[[File:CottingleyFairies2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Photo|The second of the five photographs, showing Elsie with a winged gnome]]
Author and prominent [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|spiritualist]] [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] learned of the photographs from the editor of the spiritualist publication ''Light''.{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=383|ps=none}} Doyle had been commissioned by ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'' to write an article on fairies for their Christmas issue, and the fairy photographs "must have seemed like a godsend" according to broadcaster and historian [[Magnus Magnusson]]. Doyle contacted Gardner in June 1920 to determine the background to the photographs, and wrote to Elsie and her father to request permission from the latter to use the prints in his article. Arthur Wright was "obviously impressed" that Doyle was involved, and gave his permission for publication, but he refused payment on the grounds that, if genuine, the images should not be "soiled" by money.{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|pp=99–100|ps=none}}

Gardner and Doyle sought a second expert opinion from the photographic company [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]]. Several of the company's technicians examined the enhanced prints, and although they agreed with Snelling that the pictures "showed no signs of being faked", they concluded that "this could not be taken as conclusive evidence&amp;nbsp;... that they were authentic photographs of fairies".{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=384|ps=none}} Kodak declined to issue a certificate of authenticity.{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|p=101|ps=none}} Gardner believed that the Kodak technicians might not have examined the photographs entirely objectively, observing that one had commented "after all, as fairies couldn't be true, the photographs must have been faked somehow".{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=385|ps=none}} The prints were also examined by another photographic company, [[Ilford Photo|Ilford]], who reported unequivocally that there was "some evidence of faking".{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=385|ps=none}} Gardner and Doyle, perhaps rather optimistically, interpreted the results of the three expert evaluations as two in favour of the photographs' authenticity and one against.{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=385|ps=none}}

Doyle also showed the photographs to the [[physicist]] and pioneering [[parapsychology|psychical researcher]] [[Sir Oliver Lodge]], who believed the photographs to be fake. He suggested that a troupe of dancers had masqueraded as fairies, and expressed doubt as to their "distinctly 'Parisienne{{'"}} hairstyles.{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|p=101|ps=none}}{{clear}}

On October 4, 2018 the first two of the photographs, ''Alice and the Fairies'' and ''Iris and the Gnome,'' were to be sold by Dominic Winter Auctioneers, in [[Gloucestershire]]. The prints, suspected to have been made in 1920 to sell at [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophical]] lectures, were expected to bring £700-£1000 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hester |first1=Jessica Leigh |title=For Sale: Legendary Photographic ‘Proof’ of Fairies and Gnomes |website=[[Atlas Obscura]] |url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/cottingley-fairies-photographs-for-sale?utm_source=Atlas+Obscura+Daily+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=d153f00e17-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_10_02&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f36db9c480-d153f00e17-63584145&amp;ct=t(EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_10_2_2018)&amp;mc_cid=d153f00e17&amp;mc_eid=9f3ca0a886 |accessdate=3 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003175451/https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/cottingley-fairies-photographs-for-sale?utm_source=Atlas+Obscura+Daily+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=d153f00e17-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_10_02&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f36db9c480-d153f00e17-63584145&amp;ct=t(EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_10_2_2018)&amp;mc_cid=d153f00e17&amp;mc_eid=9f3ca0a886 |archivedate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1920 photographs==
Doyle was preoccupied with organising an imminent lecture tour of Australia, and in July 1920, sent Gardner to meet the Wright family. Frances was by then living with her parents in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]],{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=385|ps=none}} but Elsie's father told Gardner that he had been so certain the photographs were fakes that while the girls were away he searched their bedroom and the area around the beck (stream), looking for scraps of pictures or cutouts, but found nothing "incriminating".{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|p=102|ps=none}}

[[File:CottingleyFairies3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Photo|''Frances and the Leaping Fairy'', the third photograph]]
Gardner believed the Wright family to be honest and respectable. To place the matter of the photographs' authenticity beyond doubt, he returned to Cottingley at the end of July with two Kodak Cameo cameras and 24&amp;nbsp;secretly marked photographic plates. Frances was invited to stay with the Wright family during the school summer holiday so that she and Elsie could take more pictures of the fairies.{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|p=102|ps=none}} Gardner described his briefing in his 1945 ''Fairies: A Book of Real Fairies'':
{{quote|I went off, to Cottingley again, taking the two cameras and plates from London, and met the family and explained to the two girls the simple working of the cameras, giving one each to keep. The cameras were loaded, and my final advice was that they need go up to the glen only on fine days as they had been accustomed to do before and ''tice'' the fairies, as they called their way of attracting them, and see what they could get. I suggested only the most obvious and easy precautions about lighting and distance, for I knew it was essential they should feel free and unhampered and have no burden of responsibility. If nothing came of it all, I told them, they were not to mind a bit.&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt;}}
Until 19 August the weather was unsuitable for photography. Because Frances and Elsie insisted that the fairies would not show themselves if others were watching, Elsie's mother was persuaded to visit her sister's for tea, leaving the girls alone. In her absence the girls took several photographs, two of which appeared to show fairies. In the first, ''Frances and the Leaping Fairy'', Frances is shown in profile with a winged fairy close by her nose. The second, ''Fairy offering Posy of [[Campanula rotundifolia|Harebells]] to Elsie'', shows a fairy either hovering or tiptoeing on a branch, and offering Elsie a flower. Two days later the girls took the last picture, ''Fairies and Their Sun-Bath''.{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|pp=102–103|ps=none}}

The plates were packed in cotton wool and returned to Gardner in London, who sent an "ecstatic" telegram to Doyle, by then in [[Melbourne]].{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|p=103|ps=none}} Doyle wrote back:
{{quote|My heart was gladdened when out here in far Australia I had your note and the three wonderful pictures which are confirmatory of our published results. When our fairies are admitted other psychic phenomena will find a more ready acceptance&amp;nbsp;... We have had continued messages at seances for some time that a visible sign was coming through.{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|p=103|ps=none}}}}{{clear}}

==Publication and reaction==

Doyle's article in the December 1920 issue of ''The Strand'' contained two higher-resolution prints of the 1917 photographs, and sold out within days of publication. To protect the girls' anonymity, Frances and Elsie were called Alice and Iris respectively, and the Wright family was referred to as the "Carpenters".{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=388|ps=none}} An enthusiastic and committed spiritualist, Doyle hoped that if the photographs convinced the public of the existence of fairies then they might more readily accept other psychic phenomena.&lt;ref name=Roden&gt;{{cite web |last=Roden |first=Barbara |title=The Coming of the Fairies: An Alternative View of the Episode of the Cottingley Fairies |url=http://www.ash-tree.bc.ca/acdsfairies.htm |publisher=The Arthur Conan Doyle Society |accessdate=25 April 2010 |mode=cs2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917124859/http://ash-tree.bc.ca/acdsfairies.htm |archivedate=17 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended his article with the words:
{{quote|The recognition of their existence will jolt the material twentieth century mind out of its heavy ruts in the mud, and will make it admit that there is a glamour and mystery to life. Having discovered this, the world will not find it so difficult to accept that spiritual message supported by physical facts which has already been put before it.&lt;ref name=Roden/&gt;}}
Early press coverage was "mixed",{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=390|ps=none}} generally a combination of "embarrassment and puzzlement".{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=391|ps=none}} The historical novelist and poet [[Maurice Hewlett]] published a series of articles in the literary journal ''John O' London's Weekly'', in which he concluded: "And knowing children, and knowing that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has legs, I decide that the Miss Carpenters have pulled one of them."{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=390|ps=none}} The Sydney newspaper ''[[Truth (Sydney newspaper)|Truth]]'' on 5 January 1921 expressed a similar view; "For the true explanation of these fairy photographs what is wanted is not a knowledge of occult phenomena but a knowledge of children."&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt; Some public figures were more sympathetic. [[Margaret McMillan]], the educational and social reformer, wrote: "How wonderful that to these dear children such a wonderful gift has been vouchsafed."{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=390|ps=none}} The novelist [[Henry De Vere Stacpoole]] decided to take the fairy photographs and the girls at face value.&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cooper |first=Joe|title=Cottingley: At Last the Truth |journal=The Unexplained |year=1982 |issue=117 |pages=2, 338–340 |mode=cs2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Gardner he wrote: "Look at Alice's [Frances'] face. Look at Iris's [Elsie's] face. There is an extraordinary thing called Truth which has 10&amp;nbsp;million faces and forms&amp;nbsp;– it is God's currency and the cleverest coiner or forger can't imitate it."

[[John Hall-Edwards|Major John Hall-Edwards]], a keen photographer and pioneer of [[X-ray#Medical uses|medical X-ray treatments]] in Britain, was a particularly vigorous critic:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Major John Hall-Edwards |url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/xray |publisher=Birmingham City Council |accessdate=23 April 2010 |mode=cs2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928204852/http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/xray |archivedate=28 September 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|On the evidence I have no hesitation in saying that these photographs could have been "faked". I criticize the attitude of those who declared there is something supernatural in the circumstances attending to the taking of these pictures because, as a medical man, I believe that the inculcation of such absurd ideas into the minds of children will result in later life in manifestations and nervous disorder and mental disturbances.&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt;}}
Doyle used the later photographs in 1921 to illustrate a second article in ''The Strand'', in which he described other accounts of fairy sightings. The article formed the foundation for his 1922 book ''The Coming of the Fairies''.{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=389|ps=none}} As before, the photographs were received with mixed credulity. Sceptics noted that the fairies "looked suspiciously like the traditional fairies of nursery tales" and that they had "very fashionable hairstyles".&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt;

==Gardner's final visit==
Gardner made a final visit to Cottingley in August 1921. He again brought cameras and photographic plates for Frances and Elsie, but was accompanied by the clairvoyant [[Geoffrey Hodson]]. Although neither of the girls claimed to see any fairies, and there were no more photographs, "on the contrary, he [Hodson] saw them [fairies] everywhere" and wrote voluminous notes on his observations.{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=390|ps=none}}

By now Elsie and Frances were tired of the whole fairy business. Years later Elsie looked at a photograph of herself and Frances taken with Hodson and said: "Look at that, fed up with fairies." Both Elsie and Frances later admitted that they "played along" with Hodson "out of mischief",{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|p=105|ps=none}} and that they considered him "a fake".{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=390|ps=none}}

==Later investigations==
Public interest in the Cottingley Fairies gradually subsided after 1921. Elsie and Frances eventually married and lived abroad for many years.{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=393|ps=none}} In 1966, a reporter from the ''Daily Express'' newspaper traced Elsie, who was by then back in England. She admitted in an interview given that year that the fairies might have been "figments of my imagination", but left open the possibility she believed that she had somehow managed to photograph her thoughts.{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|p=104|ps=none}} The media subsequently became interested in Frances and Elsie's photographs once again.&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt; [[BBC]] television's ''[[Nationwide (TV series)|Nationwide]]'' programme investigated the case in 1971, but Elsie stuck to her story: "I've told you that they're photographs of figments of our imagination, and that's what I'm sticking to".{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|p=104|ps=none}}

Elsie and Frances were interviewed by journalist [[Austin Mitchell]] in September 1976, for a programme broadcast on [[Yorkshire Television]]. When pressed, both women agreed that "a rational person doesn't see fairies", but they denied having fabricated the photographs.{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|p=105|ps=none}} In 1978 the magician and [[scientific skepticism|scientific sceptic]] [[James Randi]] and a team from the [[Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]] examined the photographs, using a "computer enhancement process". They concluded that the photographs were fakes, and that strings could be seen supporting the fairies.{{sfnp|Smith|1997|pp=394–5|ps=none}} [[Geoffrey Crawley]], editor of the ''[[British Journal of Photography]]'', undertook a "major scientific investigation of the photographs and the events surrounding them", published between 1982 and 1983, "the first major postwar analysis of the affair". He also concluded that the pictures were fakes.{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=395|ps=none}}

==Confession==
[[File:Cottingley fairies illustration.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Three dancing figures|One of Claude Arthur Shepperson's illustrations of dancing girls, from ''Princess Mary's Gift Book'']]

In 1983, the cousins admitted in an article published in the magazine ''[[The Unexplained (magazine)|The Unexplained]]'' that the photographs had been faked, although both maintained that they really had seen fairies. Elsie had copied illustrations of dancing girls from a popular children's book of the time, ''Princess Mary's Gift Book'', published in 1914, and drew wings on them.&lt;ref name="World of Strange Powers"&gt;["Fairies, Phantoms, and Fantastic Photographs". Presenter: [[Arthur C. Clarke]]. Narrator: [[Anna Ford]]. ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers]]''. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. 22 May 1985. No. 6, season 1]&lt;/ref&gt; They said they had then cut out the cardboard figures and supported them with [[hatpin]]s, disposing of their props in the beck once the photograph had been taken.{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|p=105|ps=none}} But the cousins disagreed about the fifth and final photograph, which Doyle in his ''The Coming of the Fairies'' described in this way:
{{quote|Seated on the upper left hand edge with wing well displayed is an undraped fairy apparently considering whether it is time to get up. An earlier riser of more mature age is seen on the right possessing abundant hair and wonderful wings. Her slightly denser body can be glimpsed within her fairy dress.{{sfnp|Doyle|2006|p=103|ps=none}}}}

[[File:CottingleyFairies-PrincessMary2 gobeirne.png|right|thumb|Comparison of Cottingley Fairies and illustrations from ''Princess Mary's Gift Book'']]

Elsie maintained it was a fake, just like all the others, but Frances insisted that it was genuine. In an interview given in the early 1980s Frances said:
{{quote|It was a wet Saturday afternoon and we were just mooching about with our cameras and Elsie had nothing prepared. I saw these fairies building up in the grasses and just aimed the camera and took a photograph.&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt;}}
Both Frances and Elsie claimed to have taken the fifth photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |last=Hewson |first=David |title=Secrets of Two Famous Hoaxers |date=4 April 1983 |newspaper=The Times |url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1983-04-04-03-004&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1983-04-04-03 |accessdate=26 April 2010 |mode=cs2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter published in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper on 9 April 1983, Geoffrey Crawley explained the discrepancy by suggesting that the photograph was "an unintended double exposure of fairy cutouts in the grass", and thus "both ladies can be quite sincere in believing that they each took it".&lt;ref name=crawley&gt;{{cite web |last=Crawley |first=Geoffrey |title=More to Discover about Fairies |url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/643/561/106140179w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS119245961&amp;dyn=29!xrn_2_0_CS119245961&amp;hst_1?sw_aep=mclib |accessdate=26 April 2010 |mode=cs2 }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1985 interview on [[Yorkshire Television]]'s ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers]]'', Elsie said that she and Frances were too embarrassed to admit the truth after fooling Doyle, the author of [[Sherlock Holmes]]: "Two village kids and a brilliant man like Conan Doyle&amp;nbsp;– well, we could only keep quiet." In the same interview Frances said: "I never even thought of it as being a fraud&amp;nbsp;– it was just Elsie and I having a bit of fun and I can't understand to this day why they were taken in&amp;nbsp;– they wanted to be taken in."&lt;ref name="World of Strange Powers" /&gt;{{clear}}

==Subsequent history==
[[File:FrancesGriffithsandElsieWright.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|Frances Griffiths and Elsie Wright, June 1917]]
Frances died in 1986, and Elsie in 1988.{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|p=105|ps=none}} Prints of their photographs of the fairies, along with a few other items including a first edition of Doyle's book ''The Coming of the Fairies'', were sold at auction in London for £21,620 in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Fairy' fakes sell for fortune |publisher=BBC News |date=16 July 1998 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/134243.stm |access-date=11 May 2007 |mode=cs2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Geoffrey Crawley sold his Cottingley Fairy material to the National Museum of Film, Photography and Television in Bradford (now the [[National Science and Media Museum]]), where it is on display. The collection included prints of the photographs, two of the cameras used by the girls, watercolours of fairies painted by Elsie, and a nine-page letter from Elsie admitting to the hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sorry, Mel – they're ours! |newspaper=Bradford Telegraph &amp; Argus |date=16 April 1998 |url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/archive/1998/04/16/Bradford+District+Archive/8078013.Sorry__Mel___they_re_ours_/ |access-date=25 April 2010 |mode=cs2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The glass photographic plates were bought for £6,000 by an unnamed buyer at a London auction held in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Fairy' pictures fetch £6,000 |publisher=BBC News |date=13 March 2001 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1218778.stm |access-date=11 May 2007 |mode=cs2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frances' daughter, Christine Lynch, appeared in an episode of the television programme ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' in [[Belfast]], broadcast on [[BBC One]] in January 2009, with the photographs and one of the cameras given to the girls by Doyle. Christine told the expert, [[Paul Atterbury]], that she believed, as her mother had done, that the fairies in the fifth photograph were genuine. Atterbury estimated the value of the items at between £25,000 and £30,000.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Antiques Roadshow]]''. Presenter: [[Fiona Bruce]]. [[BBC One]]. 4 January 2009. No. 17, series 31&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of Frances' memoirs was published a few months later, under the title ''Reflections on the Cottingley Fairies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cursed by the Fairies |url=http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/100031 |date=10 May 2009 |publisher=express.co.uk |access-date=22 April 2010 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book contains correspondence, sometimes "bitter", between Elsie and Frances. In one letter, dated 1983, Frances wrote:
{{quote|I hated those photographs from the age of 16 when Mr Gardner presented me with a bunch of flowers and wanted me to sit on the platform [at a Theosophical Society meeting] with him. I realised what I was in for if I did not keep myself hidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clayton |first=Emma |title=Cottingley Fairies Back in the Spotlight |date=14 July 2009 |newspaper=Bradford Telegraph &amp; Argus |url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/4492364.Book_reveals_story_behind_the_Fairies/ |access-date=3 May 2010 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 1997 films ''[[FairyTale: A True Story]]'' and ''[[Photographing Fairies]]'' were inspired by the events surrounding the Cottingley Fairies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Klein |first=Andy |title=Fairy, Fairy, Quite Contrary |newspaper=Phoenix New Times |date=23 October 1997 |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1997-10-23/film/fairy-fairy-quite-contrary/ |access-date=22 April 2010 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photographs were parodied in a 1994 book written by [[Terry Jones]] and [[Brian Froud]], ''Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Book''.{{sfnp|Ansley|2003|p=174|ps=none}}

In 2017 a further two fairy photographs were presented as evidence that the girls' parents were part of the conspiracy. Dating from 1917 and 1918, both photographs are poorly executed copies of two of the original fairy photographs. One was published in 1918 in ''[[The Sphere (newspaper)|The Sphere]]'' newspaper, which was before the originals had been seen by anyone outside the girls' immediate family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Polidoro |first1=Massimo |authorlink=Massimo Polidoro |title=The Conspiracy of the Fairies |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=1 December 2017 |volume=41 |pages=24–25 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigro retired as Chief in 2002.&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt;  That same year, in retirement, Nigro was a member of an FDNY anti-terrorism task force.&lt;ref name="NYDN1"/&gt;

Regarding Nigro's appointment as Commissioner, New York City Mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] said: "Our administration is committed to building on this department’s impressive record, increasing diversity in the ranks, and improving response time and I know Daniel has what it takes to lead the FDNY forward".&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt;

'''''De Ronde van Frankrijk''''' (''The Tour de France'') was a Belgian [[gag cartoon]] comic strip series by [[Marc Sleen]], in which he made a comedic report of every daily tournament of the annual cycling contest the [[Tour de France]]. Sleen drew the strip each year, from 1947 up until 1964, for the Flemish newspapers ''Het Vrije Volksblad'' and ''[[Het Volk (newspaper)|Het Volk]]''.&lt;ref&gt;AUWERA, Fernand, en SMET, Jan, "Marc Sleen", Uitgeverij Edicon/Standaard Uitgeverij, Antwerpen, 1985, page 116-117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/sleen.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==

Each daily cartoon was a summarization of the tournament held the day before.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/sleen.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Sleen drew caricatures of all famous cyclists and made [[pun]]s on their names and typical cycling jargon. A [[running gag]] was the always losing Belgian team. He also gave famous politicians of the day a [[cameo appearance]], including characters from his other comics series and the over-worked artist himself.

==History==

Sleen first drew the series in 1947. In 1948 he travelled along with the other journalists and the Belgian team leader [[Romain Maes]], but on all other occasions he remained at home, while listening to the live radio report. Often he drew the body of the winning cyclist of that day beforehand and waited with drawing the head until the winner was announced. When his cartoon was finished Sleen waited for a motorcyclist to pick up his drawing and drive back to the newspaper's office in [[Ghent]], so it could be published in the extra sports edition later that evening.&lt;ref&gt;AUWERA, Fernand, en SMET, Jan, "Marc Sleen", Uitgeverij Edicon/Standaard Uitgeverij, Antwerpen, 1985, page 116-117&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was terminated in 1965, along with Sleen's other [[gag-a-day]] comics, when he left ''Het Volk'' for the newspaper ''[[De Standaard]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/sleen.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Sleen also illustrated the cycling books ''Figuren uit de Tour'' and ''Humor en Tragiek uit de Tour'' by Jan Cornand and illustrated journalist Hubert Van De Vijver's reports.&lt;ref&gt;AUWERA, Fernand, en SMET, Jan, "Marc Sleen", Uitgeverij Edicon/Standaard Uitgeverij, Antwerpen, 1985, page 116-117&lt;/ref&gt; After Sleen left other artists tried to continue the series, but not with the same success.

==Book compilation==
[[Image:Ronde_van_Frankrijk.jpg|thumb|right|Book cover of the 1992 compilation by Frans Lodewijckx. The caricatured cyclist in the yellow sweater is [[Lucien Teisseire]]. ]]

In 1992 all the cartoons were compiled into Frans Lodewijckx' book ''De Grote Rondes van Marc Sleen''. Each chapter was enriched with commentaries of the newspapers' best reporters: Michel Casteels, Jan Cornand, Jérome Stevens, Willy Hofmans and André Blancke. Only the final installments of the 1948 and 1949 editions were lost and couldn't be retraced.

'''Emmy Ruiz''' is an American [[political strategist]] and political staffer. She most recently served as the Colorado State Director for [[Hillary Clinton]]'s [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zeleny|first1=Jeff|last2=Steinhauer|first2=Jennifer|title=Clinton Defeats Obama in Nevada|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/19/us/politics/19cnd-dems.html|work=The New York Times|date=19 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
After graduating from the University of Texas at San Antonio in 2006, Emmy Ruiz began working on political campaigns in 2008 as the Latino outreach director on Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign in Nevada. Ruiz told NBC News that she initially got into politics because of her admiration for Clinton:&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinton Nevada Director Emmy Ruiz: Hillary Built 'Vast' Latino Support|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/clinton-nevada-director-emmy-ruiz-hillary-built-vast-latino-support-n519156|work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“ I was working for the American Red Cross in San Antonio after college, going to (the University of Texas, San Antonio) and I always wanted to work for Hillary. I've loved her and when she ran for president (in 2008) my brother was like, 'why don't you go work for her?' And I thought she'd never hire me. I was the first field organizer hired, and coming out to Las Vegas to work for Hillary Clinton as a field organizer changed my life.
That year, Clinton won the Nevada caucus over Barack Obama, a victory that "underscored her strength among Hispanic voters," according to The New York Times.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

After the Clinton campaign, from 2009 until 2011, Ruiz worked as a Texas field director for the Democratic National Committee.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emmy Ruiz - Hillary for America|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmyruiz|website=LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obama Administration===
Beginning in May 2011, Ruiz worked for a number of organizations associated with President Barack Obama (D). She initially worked as a field director for Organizing for America in Nevada and in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emmy Ruiz|url=https://www.strausscenter.org/nextgen-fellows/item/415-emmy-ruiz|website=strausscenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Obama's 2012 reelection campaign, Ruiz transitioned to direct Obama's efforts in Nevada. Obama won the state over Mitt Romney (R) in the general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nevada|url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/results/states/nevada|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the election, Ruiz managed the comprehensive immigration reform campaign for Organizing for Action, a 501(c)(4) organization that was set up with the infrastructure from Obama's 2012 campaign. While working on the immigration campaign, Ruiz was involved in publicity for the immigration reform debates happening in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A day of progress for immigration reform|url=https://www.barackobama.com/news/a-day-of-progress-for-immigration-reform/|website=Organizing for Action}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annie's List===
Ruiz left Organizing for Action to join Annie's List as the group's political director. Annie's List is an organization that "recruits, trains, supports and elects progressive, pro-choice women in Texas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://annieslist.com/who-we-are/about/|title=Annie’s List: About}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marie Claire, Ruiz came back to Texas to work for Annie's List in order to mobilize women to vote. The magazine noted that one of Ruiz's organizing issues was the statewide cuts to family planning clinics. Ruiz told the magazine, "Women are realizing they need to get involved. They can't sit on the sidelines anymore. ... We have to see candidates who represent our values and interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Don't Mess With Texas Women|url=http://www.marieclaire.com/politics/news/a9345/dont-mess-with-texas-women/|work=Marie Claire|date=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016==
During the primary elections, Emmy Ruiz worked in Nevada as the Clinton campaign's Nevada caucus director. She was hired early in 2015 to this position, and she noted in an April 2015 fundraising email that she had already "knocked on countless doors in every part of the state on behalf of Hillary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Here’s how Hillary Clinton plans to win Nevada|url=http://lasvegassun.com/news/2015/apr/15/heres-how-hillary-clinton-plans-win-nevada/|work=LasVegasSun.com|date=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a February 2016 interview with NBC News, Ruiz explained why she supported Clinton in 2008 and 2016:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

“Hillary has this strong, strong record of fighting for Latino families. Hillary got her start organizing in politics for public justice, by registering voters in the '70s in the Rio Grande Valley - that's where I was born and raised. ... Her first trip to Nevada, she sat down with Dreamers, unscripted, off the cuff and said, 'talk to me about the challenges you are facing.' And you know what? They really held her to it. And she answered their tough questions - and they endorsed her.”

On April 29, 2016, Bloomberg reported that Emmy Ruiz would transfer from her position in Nevada to work as the campaign's state director for Colorado.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Epstein|first1=Jennifer|title=Clinton Hiring Staff in Battleground States for General Election|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-29/clinton-hiring-staff-in-battleground-states-for-general-election|publisher=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]|date=29 April 2016|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Associated Press noted that Ruiz's appointment, along with that of Mike Vlacich and the hiring of Simone Ward to state-level positions in the general election campaign, pointed towards Clinton campaign making early preparations "for what may be a hard-fought — and personally ugly — fall campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=White House 2016: Clinton gears up for Trump in fall race|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/02fa1fb13bee4160a8c30211968e4f79/white-house-2016-clinton-gears-trump-fall-race|work=The Big Story}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruiz worked closely with the Colorado Democrats, led by coordinated director [[Lisa Changadveja]].&lt;ref name="dpost"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frank|first1=John|title=Hillary Clinton hires Colorado director as she looks to November campaign|url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2016/04/29/hillary-clinton-colorado-director/125746/|publisher=[[Denver Post]]|date=29 April 2016|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Speaking with KRDO, Ruiz explained the Colorado campaign's approach, saying, "Our campaign in Colorado isn't taking anything for granted. Each day we're working hard in every corner of the state to talk about the clear choice in this election between a candidate who divides people and has run multiple businesses into the ground and a candidate who is committed to bringing people together and building an economy that works for everyone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Battleground Colorado: Clinton, Trump teams ramp up organization, outreach|url=http://www.krdo.com/news/battleground-colorado-clinton-trump-teams-ramp-up-organization-outreach/40390764|work=KRDO|date=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Ruiz explained that she felt confident in Clinton's state campaign, saying, "Americans and Coloradans have been paying attention, they have been listening. ... They've been hearing all the divisive language that Trump has been talking about. and that they have no interest in voting for him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump's $10 million ad buy includes Colorado|url=http://www.krdo.com/news/trumps-10-million-ad-buy-includes-colorado/41443478|work=KRDO|date=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Eurovision Song Contest Previews''''' are annually broadcast TV shows showcasing the entries into the forthcoming [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. They were inaugurated in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1971|1971]] for the contest in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and have been provided by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) to all participating countries ever since.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History. Carlton Books UK. {{ISBN|978-1-84732-521-1}}. April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

For a period, the [[BBC]] were responsible for 'collecting' the preview videos and distributing them to the various participating countries. This has been carried out by the contest's host nation more recently. In recent years, the Nordic broadcasters (Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland) have co-produced preview shows for broadcast across their region.

==Background==
All participants in the Eurovision Song Contest are required to submit a video of their entry to the EBU via the host broadcaster, to be distributed across the [[Eurovision (network)|Eurovision network]]. From 1971 until the early 1990s, it was compulsory for all participants to broadcast the videos. Since the mid-1990s it has become optional. Broadcasters either submit a performance of the given song&amp;nbsp;– usually taken from their local national final&amp;nbsp;– or a ''music video'' of the entry, specifically filmed for the purpose. In 1971, the Belgian preview video featured singers [[Nicole &amp; Hugo]] who were forced to withdraw days before the Eurovision final due to illness, being replaced by [[Jacques Raymond]] and Lily Castel.

Occasionally countries rely on funding from their government tourism budget to produce the video, leading to highly commercial offerings highlighting the given country's natural beauty. Often songs would vary from the version that would be heard in the contest itself; either through a change in language or a variance between the length of the recorded version and the permitted live version, or through a variance in orchestration and arrangement.

==Rules==
Early rules stated that the videos could not be broadcast in any less than two shows and the songs had to be broadcast in full. Later amendments allowed the videos to be broadcast incomplete, but that meant the length of each video still had to match. Generally speaking, the countries broadcast the shows in two parts, the entries divided as evenly as practicable between the two shows.

==History==
===1974===
In 1974, a two-night preview programme, ''[[Auftakt für Brighton]]'' (''Prelude for Brighton''), was coordinated by the German national broadcaster [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]. It was broadcast at the end of March and hosted by the journalist Karin Tietze-Ludwig. It was the first "preview"-type programme to be broadcast in many European countries simultaneously (rather than each national broadcaster showing their own preview programme). The programme was also notable in being the European television debut for the winners, [[ABBA]], who were peculiarly credited in previews as "The Abba". It was first aired on German television [[Hessischer Rundfunk]] on 27–28 March and in Finland on 30 March as ''Eurovision laulukilpailu''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abbaontv.com/1974/description-mystery-waterloo.html&lt;/ref&gt; The UK did not broadcast the programmes, instead airing their own preview shows introduced by [[David Vine]] on [[BBC1]] on 24 and 31 March.&lt;ref&gt;http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/c3c2a93df30e4c03a1559045cdd040c5&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the French entry was broadcast by all the nations showing the previews, even though the song was withdrawn from the Eurovision final itself.

===1977===
In 1977, the previews were broadcast across Europe ahead of the original scheduled broadcast date of 2 April for the Eurovision final. When the contest was postponed to 7 May, this left a long gap between the preview shows airing and the final. It was also stated in the rule book that the name of the broadcasting TV station for each country be carried on screen to introduce the songs. But many broadcasters ignored this.

===Modern day===
From approximately 2000, the videos have been available online via the Eurovision website and most broadcasters upload them to their own, local Eurovision site.

[[San Marino]] broadcaster [[SMtv San Marino|SMtv]] televised the previews for the first time in 2012, showing the videos in multiple programmes in the run up to the contest on a rotating basis, hosted by [[John Kennedy O'Connor]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smtvsanmarino.sm/eurofestival-2013/critico-john-kennedy-connor&lt;/ref&gt; SMtv has broadcast them every year since, under various formats. In 2014 O'Connor presented each entry on location in San Marino and in 2015 each entry was linked by video to the participating country. The 2016, 2017 &amp; 2018 previews were presented in a studio setting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smtvsanmarino.sm/video/eurovision&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[BBC]] broadcast the programmes in two parts, every year from 1971 to 1994 on [[BBC1]] and then again in 2002 and 2003 on [[BBC Choice]], later [[BBC Three]], in multiple shows over one week. The preview shows have been hosted by a variety of presenters over the years; including [[Terry Wogan]], [[Gloria Hunniford]], [[Ken Bruce]] and [[Lorraine Kelly]].

===Format===
Generally, but by no means always, the songs were broadcast in the order they would appear in the contest, with the UK entry saved until the end. For 1979 to 1982, the songs were shown in a random order, despite host [[Terry Wogan]] insisting in 1979 that the songs were being shown in competition order during the broadcasts. In 1982, the UK entry was scheduled to be broadcast at the end of the second programme, but was also included in the first programme in the absence of the Greek entry that was withdrawn while the shows were in production. In 1983, the UK preview video consisted of the group [[Sweet Dreams (band)|Sweet Dreams]] in speed boats off the coast of [[Dover]], Southern England, with the engine noise of the vessels included in the soundtrack, partially obscuring the song itself.

With only two exceptions (1972 and 1973) the shows were broadcast on Sunday afternoons. In 1972, the shows were given a [[prime-time]] airing in the BBC1 evening schedule.

From 1976 to 1985, the BBC provided a specifically filmed 'video' of the artist on location in the UK. In all other years, they have simply provided the performance from the national final, although often the artist's record company will also send their own commercially released video for use by the broadcasters, but these were never shown in the UK broadcasts. From 1984, the BBC included the contributing broadcasters acronym on screen for each entry.

'''Evidence Aid''' is an international platform that was formed out of the need to deliver time sensitive access to [[systematic reviews]] for use in the event of disasters and other humanitarian emergencies. The method of using systematic reviews (a collection of available evidence on any given topic) is to provide  evidence for use by policy makers, clinicians, regulators, and even the general public who benefit when these materials are easy to understand and are accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Oxman |first1= A |last2= Lavis |first2= L |last3= Fretheim |first3= A |title= Use of evidence in WHO recommendations |journal= [[The Lancet]] |year= 2007 |volume= 369 |issue= 9576 |pages= 1883–9 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60675-8 |pmid= 17493676}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vision of Evidence Aid is to create and satisfy an increasing demand for evidence to improve the impact of humanitarian aid by stimulating the use of an evidence-based approach. Evidence Aid was founded in 2004. It is currently a project that is housed by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] and [[Queens University Belfast]]. Evidence Aid was established by several members of the international Cochrane Collaboration following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]]. Evidence Aid was formed to provide systematic reviews on the effects of interventions and actions of relevance prior to, in the course of and during the aftermath of disasters or other humanitarian emergencies, in order to improve health-related outcomes; their aim is to work with those who need and use this evidence (those preparing for and responding to disasters and humanitarian emergencies – policy-makers, guideline developers, trainers, as well as aid agencies and independent consultants), as well as working with researchers and publishers to facilitate freely accessible materials to meet the information needs for those facing humanitarian emergencies and disasters. Evidence Aid works in collaboration with other organizations including [[Public Health England]]; Red Cross Flanders, International Rescue Committee; [[Centers for Disease Control]]; [[Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine]]; and the [[University of Oxford]].

== Purpose ==
Evidence Aid’s purpose is to create and satisfy an increasing demand for evidence to improve the impact of humanitarian aid by stimulating the use of an evidence-based approach.

Evidence Aid collates knowledge from systematic reviews to provide a portal of resources for decision-makers. The systematic reviews  seek to highlight which interventions work, which do not work, which need more research, and which, no matter how well meaning, might be harmful. Those in need have the right to receive humanitarian aid that has been proven to be effective and not harmful. With an increasing demand for "value for money", proof of impact and effectiveness in the provision of humanitarian aid it is essential to ensure that decisions and activities are evidence-based. They keep this information up to date where it can serve as a provision to other agencies, planning groups and [[first responders]] in, [[disasters]], [[humanitarian crises]] or major healthcare emergencies.&lt;ref name= "Kyabu2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/currents.dis.ed42382881b3bf79478ad503be4693ea |pmid=23378935 |pmc=3556506 |title=The Use of Systematic Reviews and Other Research Evidence in Disasters and Related Areas: Preliminary Report of a Needs Assessment Survey |journal=PLoS Currents |volume=5 |year=2013 |last1=Kayabu |first1=Bonnix |last2=Clarke |first2=Mike }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives of Evidence Aid are to:
* Establish and increase an evidence-based approach towards humanitarian action
* Uphold and promote the value of evidence in health outcomes across sectors
* Identify the gaps in evidence for humanitarian aid and build the resources and network to address them
* Raise the capacity and commitment of those who guide the humanitarian sector to implement an evidence-based approach

Evidence Aid also provides collections of evidence which are topic specific, such as collections for Ebola, the Health of Refugees and Asylum Seekers in Europe, Windstorms and Earthquakes. These collections contain evidence-based guidelines, randomised controlled trials, and other useful information.

== Resources ==

=== Team ===

Evidence Aid’s office is based with the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (Oxford, UK) and it also has a desk in Cochrane (London, UK). The core team of four are based in two different locations. Mike Clarke, who founded the initiative and is now the Chair of the Board of Trustees and Research Director, is a Professor at Queen’s University and also has a position at the Centre for Global Health, Trinity College Dublin. Jeroen Jansen, Evidence Aid’s first Director, is based in London and Oxford overseeing the day-to-day management and activities of Evidence Aid, and Claire Allen, Operations Manager, who works from home in Weymouth, UK, channels the integration with the world in need and brings the project and research together to facilitate evidence-based aid when nations are at their most vulnerable. They are supported by Jane Higgins, part-time Office Administrator, based in Oxford, UK. The impact of Evidence Aid is currently undergoing impact evaluation by Dominic Mellon, a Public Health Specialty Registrar based in Bristol, UK, as part of a PhD research project supervised by Mike Clarke at Queen’s.

In addition to the core team, Evidence Aid is supported by volunteers who work in various aspects of public health, humanitarian relief, and systematic reviews, where they collaborate from multiple locations around the world. Evidence Aid welcomes volunteers who are self-motivated and who can be flexible about the tasks assigned to them. Evidence Aid, as a Charity, registered with the Charity Commission in the UK also has a Board of Trustees which comprises Professor Mike Clarke (Chair), Dr Phil Davies, Lady Deborah Dixon (Treasurer), Mr Michael Stone, and Mrs Sue Wolstenholme.

=== Special Resources ===

Evidence Aid seeks to bring together systematic reviews of relevance to disasters, humanitarian crises, and major healthcare emergencies, in a single online resource&lt;ref name="resources"&gt;{{cite web |url=  http://www.evidenceaid.org/resources/ |title= Resources |work= Evidence Aid |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where they can be accessed free of charge and are available to anyone. Though information on best practice and low-cost interventions may be known in the medical, scientific or academic communities, this same information may not be available or easily found by communities or countries in crisis. Evidence Aid and its volunteers search the literature identifying relevant systematic reviews and works with others to produce short evidence summaries so that the information can be easily understood and applied by end users, in this case, those who have suffered as a result of disasters or those facing or who are experiencing humanitarian crises. The organization then uploads them to the searchable resource page where they are offered  for the use of all. Additional resources are added as the needs are identified. For example, "Landslides: A draft chapter from the upcoming book Koenig and Schultz’s Disaster Medicine: Comprehensive Principles and Practice, 2nd Edition"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koenig|first1=Kristi|last2=Carl H. Schultz|first2=Carl|last3=Kennedy|first3=Iain|last4=Petley|first4=David|last5=Murray|first5=Virginia|title=Landslides: A draft chapter from the upcoming book Koenig and Schultz’s Disaster Medicine: Comprehensive Principles and Practice|edition=2nd|url=http://www.evidenceaid.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Landslides.pdf|date=28 April 2015|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was made available as free access for Evidence Aid.

Separately, Evidence Aid has partnered with Cochrane to co-ordinate and administer four special collections covering: flooding and poor water sanitation; earthquakes; burns; and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt; The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] participated in the production of these collections and they are housed on [[The Cochrane Library]].&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt;

=== Urgent response ===

Evidence Aid is able to provide a response to disasters and humanitarian emergencies, examples as follows:

* Through its resources, it provides an urgent response to the evidence needs that arise pre, during and post event. Prior to the disaster, during and in the short-term after the event, Evidence Aid can bundle together very brief summaries of the findings of [[systematic reviews]] of relevance to, for example, the [http://evidenceaig.org/windstorms impact of windstorms] depending on the nature of the event being responded to.
* Evidence Aid works with partners to provide a context-specific resource for the evidence needs that arise during the subsequent weeks and months. This is critical because no disaster will be identical and the needs of the people and nations can change over time and context. It is possible to continue to learn from each disaster in order to adapt useful and relevant problem-solving strategies to meet the current needs. As information about what works best is shared the resources should also be useful as part of the planning for [[disaster risk reduction]] and alleviating the impact of a disaster. For an example,see the response to [[Ebola]] and the [[European migrant crisis]]. 
* Gathering information about the need for evidence and to seek to ensure that this need is met through up-to-date systematic reviews of the relevant research. Systematic Reviews are identified and included in the Evidence Aid resources. Evidence Aid works with volunteers and authors of systematic reviews to produce short summaries of each systematic review to help decision-makers to decide whether reading the full review is useful for their area of focus in the disaster.

=== Financial support ===

In addition to core staff and volunteer support, Evidence Aid has traditionally been financed by philanthropic organisations including, but not restricted to the McCall MacBain Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mccallmacbain.org/ |title= McCall MacBain Foundation |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the C&amp;A FoundatioN, [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]],and the Unorthodox Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unorthodoxprize.org/ |title= The Unorthodox Prize |publisher= |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence Aid works to provide optimal evidence that is location specific.&lt;ref name= "Gardin2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gardin |first1= M |last2= Clarke |first2= M |last3= Allen |first3= C |last4= Kayabu |first4= B |first5= W |last5= Summerskill |first6= D |last6= Devane |first7= M |last7= MacLachlan |first8= P |last8= Spiegel |first9= A |last9= Ghosh |first10= R |last10= Zachariah |first11= S |last11= Gupta |first12= V |last12= Barbour |first13= V |last13= Murray |first14= J |last14= von Schreeb |displayauthors= 4 |title= Optimal evidence in difficult settings: Improving health intentions and decision making in disasters |journal= [[PLOS Medicine]] |year= 2014 |volume= 11 |page= e1001632 |doi= 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001632 |pmid= 24755530 |pmc= 3995669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy setting ==

Evidence Aid has developed recommendations on evidence in humanitarian assistance which identify critical research needs and prioritizes them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/currents.dis.c9c4f4db9887633409182d2864b20c31 |pmid=24162731 |pmc=3805831 |title=Prioritization of Themes and Research Questions for Health Outcomes in Natural Disasters, Humanitarian Crises or Other Major Healthcare Emergencies |journal=PLoS Currents |volume=5 |year=2013 |author1=Evidence Aid Priority Setting Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Evidence Aid was awarded funds by the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) for a scoping study, "What evidence is available and what is required, in humanitarian assistance?" in 2014. This report was published to coincide with the anniversary of the 2004 tsunami. The aim of the study was to provide an independent analysis of the evidence base of evaluations in humanitarian assistance. It identifies areas where there are key gaps and where there is a need to prioritize rigorous evidence on issues that are most important and valuable. Evidence Aid worked with 3ie, the [[Karolinska Institutet]], and [[Monash University]] to develop a [[working paper]]. The first scoping paper is "[http://www.3ieimpact.org/media/filer_public/2014/12/17/3ie_scoping_paper_1-humanitarian-top.pdf What evidence is available and what is required in humanitarian assistance?"]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=M|last2=Allen|first2=C|last3=Archer|first3=F|last4=Wong|first4=D|last5=Eriksson|first5=A|last6=Puri|first6=J|title=What evidence is available and what is required, in humanitarian assistance? 3ie Scoping Paper|journal=International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie)|date=December 2014|volume=1|url=http://www.3ieimpact.org/media/filer_public/2014/12/17/3ie_scoping_paper_1-humanitarian-top.pdf|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of this research goes beyond the question of impact evaluation, key recommendations were made to move the provision of evidence forward in the sector, including:
* The case for evidence:  agreement from policy makers on the need for an evidence base;
* Priorities for evidence: a suggested framework;
* Improved accessibility to evidence: through a one–stop portal and better classification; and
* Common guidelines and standards:  through templates and standards for data collection.&lt;ref name= "Puri2014"&gt;{{cite web |last1= Puri |first1= J |last2= Aladysheva |first2= A |last3= Iversen |first3= V |last4= Ghorpade |first4= Y |last5= Brück |first5= T |displayauthors= 4 |year= 2014 |title= What methods may be used in impact evaluations of humanitarian assistance? |issue= 3ie Working Paper 22 |location= New Delhi |publisher= International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) |url= http://www.3ieimpact.org/media/filer_public/2014/12/08/wp_22_humanitarian_methods_working_paper-top.pdf |accessdate= 7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.archives-pmr.org/article/S0003-9993%2815%2900140-9/fulltext Medical Rehabilitation in Natural Disasters: A Systematic Review]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khan|first1=Fary|last2=Amatya|first2=Bhasker|last3=Gosney|first3=James|last4=Farooq Rathore|first4=Farooq|last5=Frederick  Burkle Jr|first5=Frederick|title=Medical Rehabilitation in Natural Disasters: A Systematic Review|journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation|date=19 February 2015|doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2015.02.007|url=http://www.archives-pmr.org/article/S0003-9993%2815%2900140-9/fulltext|accessdate=16 June 2015|volume=96|pages=1709–1727}}&lt;/ref&gt; looks at how rehabilitation can be managed in the course of a natural disaster where functional resources, skilled health care personnel and equipment may be limited

Evidence Aid works with partners, contributors, and volunteers from multiple nations to achieve its aim of providing people and organizations with the knowledge tools they need to make well-informed decisions and choices in their efforts to improve health, increase the quality of life and reduce human errors in disaster management following [[disasters]], [[humanitarian crises]], and major healthcare emergencies.

=== Setting priorities ===

Evidence Aid helped set priorities for the Humanitarian Evidence Programme by the identification and prioritization of themes to meet the top 30 research needs for the sector for health outcomes in humanitarian response, this strategy is one way they can work with communities to ascertain what evidence is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Ott |first1= E |last2= Krystalli |first2= RC |last3= Stites |first3= E |last4= Timmins |first4= N |last5= Walden |first5= V |last6= Gillingham |first6= E |last7= Bushby |first7= K |displayauthors= 4 |date= 6 February 2015 |title= Humanitarian Evidence Synthesis and Communication Programme: Abridged Inception Report |url= http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/pdf/outputs/HIEP/61076-Oxfam_HESC_Inception_Report_Abridged_Final3.pdf |publisher= [[Oxfam]] in partnership with the Feinstein International Center |accessdate= 7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exercise is being co-ordinated by the Feinstein International Centre at [[Tufts University]] and [[Oxfam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Vandekerckhove |first1= P |last2= Clarke |first2= M |last3= De Buck |first3= E |last4= Allen |first4= C |title= Prioritizing evidence in disaster aid |journal= Disaster medicine and Public Health Preparedness |year= 2013 |issue= 7 |pages= 593–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International  aid contributions ==

In supporting this mission, Evidence Aid has undertaken the following activities:

* One of Evidence Aid’s first projects was to inform [[psychiatrists]] and [[psychotherapists]] responding to the [[Indian Ocean tsunami]] that counsellors should not use ‘brief debriefing’ (a single-session counselling service designed to prevent [[psychological trauma]]) as a means of preventing [[PTSD]], given Cochrane Review evidence that this intervention is not effective, and, if anything, might be harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=S|last2=Bisson|first2=J|last3=Churchill|first3=R|last4=Wesseley|first4=S|title=Psychological debriefing for preventing post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)|journal=The Cochrane Library |date=2002|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000560|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000560/abstract;jsessionid=FEDCA39FCDD117963F6CD45C77612854.f02t03|accessdate=9 April 2015|pmid=12076399|pages=CD000560|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision not only led to better health for the affected population but also saved resources that were used in the deployment of more effective interventions.
* Within 24 hours of the 2010 [[Haiti earthquake]], Evidence Aid provided the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) with a comprehensive list of effective and efficient interventions for wound management, mental health, and infectious diseases. Evidence Aid worked with the WHO again in late 2010 to identify reviews that could assist with the widespread floods in [[Pakistan]]. 
* On the day of the [[Great East Japan earthquake]] and tsunami in March 2011, Evidence Aid provided access to its online resources via The Cochrane Library, which were subsequently translated into Japanese. Evidence Aid was approached by the WHO to assist with the drafting of new public health guidelines for large-scale radiation emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heneghan|first1=Carl|title=Evidence Aid: Knowledge saves lives after natural disasters|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2011/sep/26/evidence-aid-natural-disasters|accessdate=9 April 2015|publisher=Guardian|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Following [[Typhoon Haiyan]] in 2013, Evidence Aid packaged together a new set of relevant resources within 48 hours, providing responders in the Philippines with information on the health problems they might encounter.

== Raising awareness ==

Evidence Aid has raised the profile of evidence-based actions in the humanitarian sector through international conferences in Oxford in 2011 with the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine, Brussels in 2012 with the Belgian Red Cross–Flanders, at which [[Herman van Rompuy]], the President of the [[European Council]] in 2012 said "Evidence Aid has provided governments, agencies, NGOs, and individuals with the most reliable information in order to take the right choices in difficult circumstances… the work you are doing is important for mankind", and a priority setting meeting in [[London]] in 2013. In addition, and in partnership with the South Asian Cochrane Centre, Evidence Aid offered its [http://www.evidenceaid.org/evidence-aid-a-decade-on-from-the-indian-ocean-tsunami/ third conference in 2014] in [[Hyderabad]], India – fitting since responding to the [[Indian Ocean tsunami]] was the inspiration for the founding of Evidence Aid. Evidence Aid works with a number of organizations in different capacities.&lt;ref name= "Allen2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Allen |first1= C |title= A resource for those preparing for and responding to natural disasters, humanitarian crises, and major healthcare emergencies |journal= Journal of Evidence Based Medicine |year= 2014 |volume= 7 |pages= 234–7 |doi= 10.1111/jebm.12127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline Fiennes, a [[blog]]ger at ''Third Sector'', wrote about using evidence in dealing with humanitarian crises in a post, "In the decade since the Asian tsunami, we're marshalling the evidence with far better effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fiennes|first1=C|title=In the decade since the Asian tsunami, we’re marshaling the evidence with far better effect|url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/caroline-fiennes-decade-asian-tsunami-were-marshalling-evidence-far-better-effect/article/1322402|publisher=Third Sector|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World hunger ==

In low and middle-income countries, research has found that providing additional food to children aged three months to five years may result in modest gains in weight and height, and [[haemoglobin]]. Food supplementation resulted in positive impacts on psycho-motor development. However evidence on mental development was mixed. Disasters, war and famine increase risk for food shortages and decreased family incomes both during the disaster and in the aftermath therefore getting food to children and vulnerable populations in safe, effective and efficient ways is an important priority in crisis relief.

[[Malnutrition]] contributed to the deaths of more than three million children in 2011. Malnutrition leads to higher infection risks, plus it impairs physical and mental development making the undernourished child more susceptible to chronic disease in adulthood. A Cochrane systematic review pointed out that evidence about the effectiveness of nutrition interventions for young children, is fundamentally important. The Evidence Aid summary points to troubling news about the treatment of children in the home when food is scarce. The review found food was commonly redistributed within the family; when feeding was home-delivered, children benefited from only 36% of the energy given in the supplement. However, when the supplementary food was given in day care centers or feeding compounds, leakage was reduced; children took in 85% of the energy provided in the supplement. Supplementary food was more effective for younger children (under two years old) and for those who were poorer or less well-nourished. Quality supervision within feeding programs was found to result in a greater proportion of required daily food for energy. These discrepancies were less common in high-income countries, where two studies found no benefits for growth.&lt;ref name="Kristjansson2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kristjansson |first1= E |last2= Francis |first2= DK |last3= Liberato |first3= S |last4= Benkhalti Jandu |first4= M |last5= Welch |first5= V |last6= Batal |first6= M |last7= Greenhalgh |first7= T |last8= Rader |first8= T |last9= Noonan |first9=E |last10= Shea |first10= B |last11= Janzen |first11= L |last12= Wells |first12= G  A |last13= Petticrew |first13= M |displayauthors= 4 |title= Food supplementation for improving the physical and psychosocial health of socio-economically disadvantaged children aged three months to five years |journal= [[Cochrane Library|Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews]] |year= 2015 |issue= 3 |page= CD009924 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD009924.pub2 |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Refugee resettlement ==
The arrival in a host country is not always the refuge of safety the displaced person hopes for. During the passage they face the challenges of substandard shelter and sanitation, and dangerously long waits for food and water through treacherous weather and with disease ridden companions. Many including the children will witness the death, abuse and [[torture]] of fellow travelers and family members. This leaves the refugees vulnerable to [[mental health disorders]] including [[PTSD]] and [[Depression (differential diagnoses)|depression]], [[Vaccine-preventable diseases|vaccine-preventable disease]], skin disease such as [[Impetigo]], [[Scabies]] and [[Cellulitis]], [[Tuberculosis]], [[Snakebite|snake]] and [[Insect bites and stings|insect]] bite, [[malaria]] and they may also be exposed to violence and [[sexual abuse]].
 
This presents numerous challenges for the host countries as the conditions may not be common to their population, the [[refugees]] are unable to communicate in the host country language and their customs and culture may be at odds with the values commonly understood and practiced. Many [[displaced persons]] fear forced [[repatriation]] or [[Detention (imprisonment)|detention]] and they are unable to navigate the [[bureaucracy]] around the local or national health care culture. This presents a public health issue as chronic health issues or respiratory infections including TB are untreated. The pregnant women may have had no prenatal care and the conflict and persecution they flee from may take its toll on their mental health. Evidence Aid has made evidence available to assist regulators, clinicians, and organizations to increase the ability of host nations to assist refugees settled or in flight. This initiative is a collaboration between [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]], [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]], Kevin Pottie, Leo Ho and Evidence Aid and incorporates the contributions of many [[volunteering|volunteers]] and experts in health.

There is also a movement to professionalize the field. Evidence Aid plays a role in this by: conducting systematic evidence reviews to identify optimal interventions and; providing this information in an easily accessible format to decision-makers and front-line relief workers. Evidence Aid bases their resources on epidemiological and evidence-based information (via systematic reviews) to meet the needs of the populations addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Clarke |first1= M |last2= Baille |first2= K |last3= Connolly |first3= S |last4= Murray |first4= L |chapter= Clinical epidemiology and evidence-based medicine |editor1-last= Yarnell |editor1-first= J |editor2-last= O’Reilly |editor2-first= D |title= Epidemiology and Disease Prevention: A Global Approach |edition= 2nd |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |year= 2013 |pages= 67–86 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Famine events''' are localized events of voluntary fasting for 30 or 40 hours depending on the region to raise money and awareness for [[world hunger]]. These events are usually coordinated by one of various [[World Vision]] organizations and are done by youth in church organizations. They have spread internationally, notably the international '''30 Hour Famine''', also the regional '''40 Hour Famine''' in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] and the '''24 Hour Famine''' in the [[United Kingdom]]. The 30 Hour Famine is the most popular amongst all, spreading across 21 countries. {{Cref|a}}

== 30 Hour Famine ==
[[File:30hf icon reverse.jpg|100px|thumb|right]]
The '''30 Hour Famine''' is a [[World Vision]] event in 21 countries. It started in 1971 when 17-year-old Ruth Roberts and 14 friends in [[Calgary, Alberta]] staged an event in a church basement to see what it was like to be hungry and raise money and awareness for children suffering during a famine. The funds raised went to World Vision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldvision.ca/wvfamine/live/about-the-famine/ World Vision Canada] "''The first 30 Hour Famine took place in Calgary, Alberta, 36 years ago, when a group of youths refused to sit back and do nothing about the famine...''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.langleyadvance.com/issues06/041206/news/041206nn12.html Langley Advance]&lt;/ref&gt;

David L. Wylie, a nondenominational youth leader, jump-started the movement in the United States about seventeen years ago as a youth director of Millen Baptist Church in South Georgia. He was looking for a way to stimulate the interest of his 25-member youth group in world hunger issues when he heard the idea of a voluntary hunger strike from World Vision. His group raised $3,000 that year, $5,000 the next and was featured on CNN Headline News and Wylie was nominated by Congressman Lindsey Thomas for a Presidential Point of Light Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?s_hidethis=no&amp;p_product=AT&amp;p_theme=at&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=David%20Wylie,%2030%20Hour%20Famine&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(David%20Wylie,%2030%20Hour%20Famine)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no Welcome to stacks.ajc.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
Wylie was also recognized by the Georgia House of Representatives, the Georgia Senate, and numerous Georgia governors for his efforts to get youth involved in hunger causes by using the 30-Hour Famine program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22david+Wylie%22%2C+30-Hour+Famine&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of teenagers across the [[United States|U.S.]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/112-02232007-1303633.html Burlington County Times]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canada]], and several other countries (including [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2005/07/02/2003261867 Taipei Times]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malaysia]], [[UK]], [[Singapore]] and [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]) participate to raise money and then fast for 30 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.30hourfamine.org/ Welcome to 30 Hour Famine]&lt;/ref&gt; However, individuals can raise money and fast by themselves.

During the event, for 30 hours, participants must abstain from eating food, and instead they typically drink water, fruit juices, or other liquids&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standardnewswire.com/news/38395648.html Standard Newswire] "''Energized with compassion rather than food during their fast, 30 HF groups ... consume only water and fruit juices"''&lt;/ref&gt; Games, fund raisers, and other events may also take place to help teach and educate the participants and others about world hunger all over the world. It is also a time for education and awareness of world hunger, and an understanding of how people go without food for long periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/24/AR2007022401366.html The Washington Post] "But education about global poverty was the main focus of the long day. The students watched DVDs about poverty issues. And Harrington showed off a banner on which the students had pressed 30,000 fingerprints in red paint, designed to help them better understand the magnitude of the problem."&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, does not exclude those unable to fast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldvision.ca/wvfamine/About-the-Famine/FAQs/Pages/default.aspx World Vision Canada FAQs] ''"Q. I am physically unable to fast. Can I still do the Famine?"''&lt;/ref&gt;

== 40 Hour Famine - Australia ==
[[File:40 Hour Famine logo.svg|thumb|Current logo]]
[[File:40hourfamine.png|thumb|Previous logo]]
The '''40 Hour Famine''' is an annual [[Charitable organization|charitable]] event held by [[World Vision]] [[Australia]]. The event aims for young Australians to feel empathy for the lack of food which children in [[third world country|third world countries]] struggle with, and to raise money to help children in these countries. It was started in 1975 in response to the famine in [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=124&amp;art_id=vn20070303084451310C184592 40-hour famine to aid the poor] paragraph 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants must first raise money through sponsorship from other people. Participants must then abstain from a particular group of items or do/not do something for 40 hours. Some of the famines include not eating food, not using [[first world]] technology such as television, refraining from talking, and not using furniture. Some participants create their own famines, such as living in a cardboard box or being blindfolded. The event officially runs from 8pm on Friday to noon on Sunday, usually over a weekend in August. Participants may choose another time to fast if the official famine dates do not suit them.

Children who attend primary school (usually between the ages of 4 - 12) are encouraged to participate in the 8 hour famine for safety reasons, instead of the usual 40 hour famine.

== 40 Hour Famine - New Zealand ==
The 40 Hour Famine, [[New Zealand]]'s largest youth fundraiser, is an annual [[World Vision]] New Zealand campaign aimed at providing New Zealanders with a unique experience, as a catalyst for fundraising.

The 40 Hour Famine was launched in 1975 by World Vision. This first 40 Hour Famine, on 15–17 August 1975, had 10,000 participants and raised NZ$265,000.

Since then, the 40 Hour Famine has continued to grow, raising over $2.5 million through 118,000 participants. The 40 Hour Famine, in many New Zealand schools and communities, has become an annual tradition.

== 24 Hour Famine ==
'''24 Hour Famine''' is also an annual charity event held by World Vision UK which started in 1986.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} The aim is to raise awareness and money for people stricken by famine around the world. Participants can choose to go without food for the duration, or other activities such as computer games or talking. In 2008, the official Cause was the 'nowhere children' in Chennai.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Age restrictions apply: 0–13 years are only allowed to fast for 20 hours whilst 14+ years can fast for up to 40 hours.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

== Notes ==
{{refbegin}}
{{Cnote|a|World Vision does not address the global famine events in one general term, but rather address them in regionally specific names. The 30 Hour Famine is the most popular and earliest event amongst all. Its popularity is especially high in East Asia countries and North America. The 40 Hour Famine is dedicated to Australia and New Zealand only, while the 24 Hour Famine is solely dedicated to the United Kingdom.}}

[[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] (later [[Lieutenant Commander]]) '''George Henry Gay Jr.''' (March 8, 1917 &amp;ndash; October 21, 1994) was a [[TBD Devastator]] pilot in [[United States Navy]] [[VT-8|Torpedo Squadron 8]] operating from the [[USS Hornet (CV-8)|USS ''Hornet'' (CV-8)]] in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]] during [[World War II]].  Of the 30 VT-8 aircrew from ''Hornet'' that participated in the pivotal [[Battle of Midway]], Ensign Gay was the sole survivor.&lt;ref name="nhcgay"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/oral-histories/wwii/battle-of-midway/recollections-of-lieutenant-george-gay.html|title=Recollections of Lieutenant George Gay, USNR|date=September 21, 2015|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command}}&lt;!--{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq81-8c.htm |title=LT George Gay, VT-8 sole survivor of Battle of Midway |publisher=www.history.navy.mil |archivedate=2010-12-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205192132/http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq81-8c.htm |deadurl=yes |df= }}--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NavyBio&gt;{{cite web |title=George Henry Gay (8 March 1917 - 21 October 1994) |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/research-guides/modern-biographical-files-ndl/modern-bios-g/gay-george-h.html |date=June 8, 2017 |publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
George Henry Gay Jr. was born on March 8, 1917 in [[Waco, Texas]]. He attended school in both [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and [[Houston]] before enrolling at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (now [[Texas A&amp;M University]]).

==World War II==
Like millions of Americans at the time, Gay chose to sign up for the coming war, leaving [[Texas A&amp;M University]]. He tried to join the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] as a pilot but was rejected for medical reasons. He then tried the [[United States Navy]] in early 1941. Gay completed flight training and was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] in Sept 1941.

He joined the newly formed [[VT-8|Torpedo Squadron 8]] under Lieutenant Commander [[John C. Waldron|John Charles Waldron]].   He and his unit were aboard the ''[[USS Hornet (CV-8)|USS Hornet]]''  in April 1942 when Lieutenant Colonel [[Jimmy Doolittle]] launched [[Doolittle raid|his raid]] on [[Tokyo]]. One week later, the ''Hornet'' arrived at [[Pearl Harbor]] to join the ''[[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|USS Enterprise]]'' as part of [[Task Force 16]] during the [[Battle of Midway]].
[[File:Vt8-g-gay-may42.jpg|thumb|[[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] George H. Gay Jr. (right), sole survivor of VT-8's [[TBD Devastator]] group, in front of his aircraft with his rear gunner, ARM3c George Arthur Field, while ''Hornet'' was in the Coral Sea, c. May 1942.]]
During the [[Battle of Midway]] Gay was the first of his squadron to take off from ''Hornet'' on June 4, 1942. Gay's unit found the [[Japan]]ese carrier fleet and launched an attack without any [[Fighter aircraft|fighter plane]] support. Although he was wounded and his radioman/gunner, [[Robert K. Huntington]],&lt;ref name=Symonds&gt;{{cite book |first=Craig L. |last=Symonds |authorlink=Craig Symonds |title=The Battle of Midway |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-539793-2 |page=271 |oclc=910522932}}&lt;/ref&gt; was dying, Gay completed his torpedo attack on the Japanese [[aircraft carrier]] ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Soryu|Soryu]]'', but the ''Soryu'' evaded his torpedo. Rather than banking away from the ship and presenting a larger target to its anti-aircraft gunners, Gay continued in toward the carrier at low altitude. He then brought his Devastator into a tight turn as he approached the carrier's island, and flew aft along the flight deck's length, thus evading anti-aircraft fire. He later stated he had a "split second" thought of crashing into the Japanese aircraft he saw being serviced on the flight deck.&lt;ref name=nhcgay /&gt;

{{quotation|It's when a fellow is just gone and knows it, it is just crash into the ship or crash into the sea, and you have enough control to do a little bit more damage, why you crash into the ship.|George H. Gay&lt;ref name=nhcgay/&gt;}}

His plane still in relatively good condition, he decided to make for the ''Hornet'' after clearing the Japanese carrier. However, five [[A6M Zero|A6M ''Zero''s]] brought his aircraft down in a hail of machine gun and cannon fire, killing his rear gunner.&lt;ref name=nhcgay/&gt; Exiting his aircraft, and floating in the ocean, he hid under his seat cushion to avoid Japanese strafing attacks and witnessed the [[Battle of Midway#Attacks on the Japanese fleet|subsequent dive bombing attacks]] and sinking of three of the four Japanese aircraft carriers present.&lt;ref&gt;Joe James Custer (United Press), ''Watches Jap Carriers Go By in Flames'', Waterloo Daily Courier, 1942-06-09 at 1, available at NewspaperArchive.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

After dark, Gay felt it was safe to inflate his life raft. He was rescued by a Navy [[PBY]] after spending over 30&amp;nbsp;hours in the water. Gay was later flown to the [[USS Vincennes (CA-44)|USS ''Vincennes'']] (arriving June 28, 1942), before being transferred home.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/log-Vincennes-Donald-Hugh-Dorris/dp/B00071WTFG Log Of The Vincennes], pg. 371 Copyright Jonathan Truman Dorris, 1947, ASIN: B00071WTFG&lt;/ref&gt; Of the squadron's thirty&amp;nbsp;pilots and radiomen, Gay was the only survivor. Gay met with [[Chester W. Nimitz|Admiral Nimitz]] and confirmed the destruction of three Japanese carriers that he had witnessed – the ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|Akagi]]'', ''Kaga'' and ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Sōryū|Soryu]]''.  He was featured in the August 31, 1942 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine.

Following Midway, Gay took part in the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] with [[VFA-115|Torpedo Squadron 11]], and he later became a Navy [[flight instructor]]. He was awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]], [[Purple Heart]] and [[Presidential Unit Citation (US)|Presidential Unit Citation]] for his actions in combat at Midway. He was also later awarded the [[Air Medal]].

==Later years==
After [[World War II]], Gay spent over 30&amp;nbsp;years as a pilot for [[Trans-World Airlines]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news |title=George H. Gay, 77, Was Sole Survivor of Midway Attack |work=The New York Times |date=October 24, 1994 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/24/obituaries/george-h-gay-77-was-sole-survivor-in-a-midway-attack.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often lectured on his Midway experiences, and authored the book ''Sole Survivor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George |last=Gay |title=Sole Survivor |isbn=0-938300-08-3 |oclc=7738297 |date=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, he served as a consultant on the set for the movie ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'', in which [[Kevin Dobson]] played Gay.&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt; He attended the decommissioning ceremony of the {{USS|Midway|CV-41|6}} on April 11, 1992.

A '''hurricane party''' is a social event held by people in the coastal [[United States]] who live in [[hurricane alley]] between [[Maine]] and [[Texas]] and is common in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]].&lt;ref name="IBT"&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Throw a Hurricane Party for Irene|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/how-throw-hurricane-party-irene-305338|date=August 26, 2011|publisher=[[International Business Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is held during a [[hurricane]].&lt;ref name="IBT"/&gt; However the guests are typically allowed to stay with the host for 3–5 days (weather permitting) and guests, in return, bring hurricane supplies such as radios, first aid supplies, food, etc.&lt;ref name="IBT"/&gt; The infamous [[Hurricane Camille#Hurricane Party|Hurricane Camille Hurricane Party]] did not occur, but 8 people from the apartments died and the entire building was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://camille.passchristian.net/hurricane_party.htm|title=Hurricane Party|website=camille.passchristian.net|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Hurricane parties were formed by people living in the [[Southern United States|southern]] hurricane areas of the United States, especially in  Florida. Events are held by people who, cannot or choose not to [[Emergency evacuation|evacuate]] during a [[hurricane warning]], or when no evacuation orders are issued. Hosts may also lack hurricane supplies, therefore they invite others to stay with them so as to share supplies and company. However, these events are usually more centered on the people and the socialness of the event, yet they are not necessarily done with diversion as an objective.

Another rationale for hosting hurricane parties is the expectation that power service may be lost for days or even weeks. As a result most perishable items, particularly frozen meats, will surely be wasted after the storm. In order to make good use of these items, grilling is an important aspect of many hurricane parties, as a way of "cleaning out the freezer."

==Party supplies and customs==
Hurricane parties are designed for many individuals to pool resources with the expectation that there will be no electricity and no open stores or restaurants for several days.  Following hurricanes, there is generally a curfew set by local police to reduce looting and crime when resources are already stretched thin.  The hurricane party means that people don't have to worry about traveling when roads and transportation will be impassable.  The hurricane party frequently aims to go through perishable food, and thus grilling is a common activity since grills can be used regardless of the status of electric utilities.  

Alcohol is almost always in good supply at a hurricane party, but guests are advised to pace themselves since these parties are often multi-day events.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Officials don't recommend drinking alcohol because people need to be alert during a disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/10/drinking-at-hurricane-parties-bad-idea-florida-officials-warn.html|title=Drinking at 'hurricane parties' a bad idea, Florida officials warn|date=2017-09-10|work=Fox News|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}The '''Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2006''' was the fourth edition of the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest]] for young singers aged 8 to 15. On 2 December 2006, the contest was broadcast live from [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]] making it the second time the contest had been held in a capital city. It was organised by the Romanian national broadcaster, [[Romanian Television]] (TVR), in co-operation with the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU). TVR won the rights of hosting the contest over [[AVRO (broadcaster)|AVRO]] of the [[Netherlands]] (who hosted the next contest).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/5045|title='EBU Confirms: Romania to host Junior 2006'|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Croatia]] also expressed an interest in hosting this contest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/3231 'Croatia and Romania want to host junior 2006'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116054119/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/3231 |date=2006-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was broadcast live in the competing countries, as well as [[Andorra]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the Australian television channel [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS) that acquired the rights for broadcasting the show, which was broadcast on 1 January 2007. This was [[Serbia]]'s first Eurovision event as an Independent nation. The contest was won by [[Tolmachevy Sisters|The Tolmachevy Twins]] from [[Russia in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest|Russia]] with the song "[[Vesenniy Jazz]]".

Polyvalent Hall from Bucharest ({{lang-ro|Sala Polivalentă din București}}) is a multi-purpose hall in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]], located in the [[Tineretului Park]]. It is used for [[concert]]s, indoor sports such as [[tennis]], [[gymnastics]], [[Dancesport|dance]], [[Team handball|handball]], [[volleyball]], [[basketball]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], [[combat sport]]s and [[professional wrestling]]. The hall was opened in 1974 but has since been renovated. It has a maximum seating capacity of 12,000 for concerts and 6,000 for handball.

==Participation==
Originally 16 countries had initially signed up for the contest but one unspecified country later dropped out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/5947|title='EBU: 16 countries signed up for Junior 2006'|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RTBF|Radio télévision belge de la communauté française]] (RTBF) of the French-speaking [[Wallonia]] in Belgium left the contest this year after co-hosting the previous edition with Flemish broadcaster [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep]] (VRT). They claimed that continuing with the contest was not in their interests financially.&lt;ref name="RTBFout"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=ESC Today|date=29 November 2005 |url= http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/5219 |title= 'RTBF withdraws from Junior contest' |accessdate=2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The viewing figures for the 2005 contest for RTBF were also low. Belgium continued to be represented at the contest by VRT.

[[Croatian Radiotelevision|Hrvatska radiotelevizija]] (HRT) of Croatia announced that they would withdraw from the 2007 edition and future contests, as otherwise they would have faced a fine from the EBU as they did not screen this year's event live and did not broadcast it on a nationally available network. Broadcasters previously had to screen the event live and on a channel available to the majority of the public however this rule was scrapped in 2007.&lt;ref name="croawithdraw"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=ESC Today|date=20 January 2007 |url= http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/7303 |title= ESC Today article on withdrawal of Croatia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403034017/http://esctoday.com/news/read/7303 |archive-date=3 April 2012 |accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croatia withdrew the following year and would not participate for seven years until they returned in [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2014|2014]].

===Withdrawn countries===
The Scandinavian broadcasters; [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]] of [[Denmark]], [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|Norsk rikskringkasting]] (NRK) of [[Norway]] and [[Sveriges Television]] (SVT) of [[Sweden]]; decided to withdraw from the contest for various reasons, one being that the content put too much pressure on the participating children. Instead they staged a solely Scandinavian contest called [[Melodi Grand Prix Nordic]] in Stockholm, as they did in 2002. However, Sweden did participate, which was quite unexpected since they placed 15th all earlier years, with commercial broadcaster [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]] supplying Sweden's entry. This meant that Sweden participated in both contests.

[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], the [[United Kingdom]] broadcaster of the contest from 2003 up until and including 2005, withdrew from the contest, after they were originally given the rights to broadcast it when the [[BBC]] declined the offer. In 2003, they broadcast the contest on main channel [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], relegating it to [[ITV2]] for the next two years due to bad viewer ratings, before their complete withdrawal in 2006.

[[Monaco]] had stated an interest to take part in the contest, however did not take part in the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/4790/monaco_plans_junior_participation_in_2006/|title=Eurovision Monaco plans junior participation in 2006 - ESCToday.com|date=22 July 2005|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latvia]] also withdrew, mainly due to financial reasons. However they briefly returned to the contest in 2010 and 2011.

[[Serbia and Montenegro]] participated in the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005 contest]], but since then, [[Montenegro]] [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|voted for independence]]. The EBU gave their national broadcaster, [[RTCG|Radio televizija Crne Gore]] (RTCG), extra time to decide whether or not to participate, but they finally declined the invitation. It wasn't until 2014 that they would start participating in the Junior Eurovision.

The [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) invited broadcasters to bid for the rights to host the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2009; three bids were received from Belarus, Serbia, and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=3557|title=Three bids for Junior Eurovision 2009|last=Konstantopoulos|first=Fotis|date=2008-06-02|publisher=''Oikotimes''|accessdate=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]] of Sweden had originally sent in a bid during summer 2007, but soon withdrew its bid after deciding to completely withdraw from the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=883|title=TV4 is the third bidding broadcaster for JESC 2009|date=2007-09-14|publisher=''Oikotimes''|accessdate=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After deliberations by the EBU, [[National Television Company of Ukraine]] was granted the rights to the 2009 contest and would host it in [[Kiev]].&lt;ref name="ukrwin"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=''ESCToday''|date=2008-06-06 |url= http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/12069|title= JESC - Ukraine: To host Junior Eurovision 2009|accessdate=2008-06-18|author=Floras, Stella}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukraine also hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005]] at the same venue.

On 12 November 2009 Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister [[Ivan Vasiunyk]] declared that the contest would not be postponed; (earlier) [[Party of Regions]] [[Verkhovna Rada#Composition|member of parliament]] [[Hanna Herman]] had called on [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]] [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] to cancel the song contest because of the [[2009 flu pandemic in Europe#Ukraine|2009 flu pandemic in Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/24766/ Ukraine will not postpone Junior Eurovision 2009 over flu outbreak - official], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (13 November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Prime Minister Tymoshenko and [[President of Ukraine]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]] were present during the final; Tymoshenko was also present and speeched during the opening ceremony on 16 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://photo.unian.net/eng/themes/15425?fp=40 Events by themes: Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2009], [[UNIAN]] (November 21, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept and logo==
Logo of the contest titled "[[Tree of life]]" is based on the artwork "Sunflower of life" by [[Maria Primachenko]], a well known Ukrainian folk art painter. Creative design of the show was based on the logo of the contest, works and ideas of Primachenko as well as on the concept of the show, titled "For the joy of people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esckaz.com/jesc/2009/event.htm|title=Logo and concept of Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2009 have been presented|date=2009-08-11|accessdate=2009-08-11|publisher=''ESCKaz''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
The EBU announced the complete list of participating countries in the 2009 Contest on 8 June 2009. 13 countries competed in the contest: Armenia, Belarus, Belgium, Cyprus, Georgia, Macedonia, Malta, Netherlands, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Sweden and Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Countries" /&gt; [[Sweden]] returned after missing the contest, while [[Bulgaria in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest|Bulgaria]], [[Greece in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest|Greece]] and [[Lithuania in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest|Lithuania]] withdrew from the Contest.&lt;ref name="Countries" /&gt;

==Final==
Each country decided their votes through a 50% jury and 50% televoting system which decided their top ten songs using the points 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1. Since Sweden broadcast the show not until the morning after, their points were made up solely by their national jury.

'''Karneval der Kulturen''' (Carnival of Cultures) is a multicultural festival in [[Kreuzberg]], [[Berlin]], celebrated annually around [[Pentecost]] weekend since 1996. It is organised by the Werkstatt der Kulturen. The processions, theatre performances, and music events celebrate peace, tolerance, and multiculturalism.

== History ==
The Werkstatt der Kulturen was founded in October 1993 in [[Neukölln]], Berlin, patronised by the [[Berlin Senate]]. The first Karneval der Kulturen took place on 15 and 16 May 1996 around [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension Thursday]]. It was inspired by other European carnevals such as the [[Notting Hill Carnival]] in [[London]] and the [[Summer Carnival|Zomercarnaval]] in [[Rotterdam]].

The Karneval der Kulturen then grew to a four-day festival with numerous musical and theatrical performances. The number of visitors grew from 50,000 in 1996 to 300,000 in 1997, 1 million in 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wer sich maskiert, wird integriert.

The '''Kentucky Derby Festival''' is an annual festival held in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] during the two weeks preceding the first Saturday in May, the day of the [[Kentucky Derby]]. The festival, [[Kentucky]]'s largest single annual event, first ran from 1935 to 1937, and restarted in 1956&lt;ref&gt;The Derby itself began in 1875 at [[Churchill Downs]].&lt;/ref&gt; and includes:
* '''[[Thunder Over Louisville]]''', the largest annual [[fireworks|fireworks display]] in North America;
* the '''Great [[Hot air ballooning#Competition|Balloon Race]]''';
* '''[[Great Steamboat Race|The Great Steamboat Race]]''', featuring the ''[[Belle of Louisville]]'';
* the '''Pegasus Parade''', one of the largest [[parade]]s in the [[United States]]; and
* the '''Kentucky Derby Festival [[Marathon]]''' &amp; '''[[Mini marathon|miniMarathon]]'''.
* the Kentucky Derby Festival Basketball Classic

==History==
The Kentucky Derby Festival Association started the first week-long festival in 1935, including a parade, a riverfront regatta and an orchestral concert.  The first director was Olympic gold medalist [[Arnold Jackson (athlete)|Arnold Jackson]]. In 1937, a Derby Festival king and queen were crowned, marking the start of this tradition.  After the floods of 1937, the festival was discontinued and it was not until 1956 when the modern-day Kentucky Derby Festival was reborn.

==Official events==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2008}}
Events vary from year to year but always include numerous athletic events, including the miniMarathon and Marathon; concerts; fashion shows; wine tastings; luncheons and private parties ranging from backyard barbecues to lavish Derby Eve balls attended by entertainment stars, famed athletes and other persons of note.

===The Royal Court===
The Royal Court is among the oldest traditions of the Kentucky Derby Festival tradition, dating back to the 1950s by The Fillies, Inc. The Royal Court consists of a group of five young women chosen to preside over events related to the Kentucky Derby. These women officially represent both the Derby Festival and the city of Louisville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.derbycraze.com/kentucky-derby-festivals.html |title=Famous Kentucky Derby Festivals |website=derbycraze.com |accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January, a court of Derby Princesses is selected from a pool of more than 1000 applicants. Thirty finalists are selected and the pool is then reduced to five young women who make up the court. Criteria for the selection of the court members includes knowledge of the Derby Festival, poise, intelligence, personality, academic excellence and campus/community involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan |first=Jacob |url=http://www.whas11.com/sports/derby-horse-racing/Kentucky-Derby-Festival-Queen-crowned-203921291.html |title=2013 Kentucky Derby Festival Queen crowned &amp;#124; WHAS11.com Louisville |publisher=Whas11.com |date=2013-04-20 |accessdate=2013-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105160318/http://www.whas11.com/sports/derby-horse-racing/Kentucky-Derby-Festival-Queen-crowned-203921291.html |archivedate=2013-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court attends nearly 70 events during the two-week period leading up to the Kentucky Derby. The queen is selected by a spin of the wheel at the Annual Fillies Derby Ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefillies.org|title=ACW Fillies - Home|website=www.thefillies.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival saw this method of queen selections as the most fair way to select from their court and the tradition continues today. Each member of the court is awarded a $2000 scholarship, an entire wardrobe for the festival, VIP access to all events and a chauffeur for the entire two weeks of the official Kentucky Derby Festival.

===Thunder Over Louisville===
[[File:Thunder Over Louisville.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fireworks at Thunder Over Louisville]]
The festival's first major event is [[Thunder Over Louisville]]. Thunder kicks off with a day-long air show ranked as fifth-largest in the United States{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and the largest [[fireworks|fireworks display]] in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lammers|first1=Braden|title=Distinguished service awards presented to the men behind Thunder Over Louisville|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2014/04/11/distinguished-service-awards-presented-to-the-men.html?page=all|accessdate=October 16, 2014|work=Louisville Business First|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|date=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approximately 30 minute firework display begins at nightfall. Thunder Over Louisville's fireworks have been designed and performed by [[Zambelli Fireworks|Zambelli Fireworks International]] since 1991.

=== Fest-a-Ville ===
During the festival, much of [[Louisville Waterfront Park|Waterfront Park]] is billed as "Fest-aVille". It hosts a number of events, including the Chow Wagon, rides, and concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://discover.kdf.org/krogers-fest-a-ville/|title=Kroger's Fest-a-Ville℠|last=|first=|date=|website=discover.kdf.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://discover.kdf.org/chow-wagon/|title=Chow Wagon®|last=|first=|date=|website=discover.kdf.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poster ===
Each year, an official Derby Festival poster is unveiled and prints are sold to help finance festival events. Artists and photographers who have produced the prized posters include [[Peter Max]] and Michael Schwab.

=== Pegasus parade ===
The first event held by KDF was the 1956 Pegasus Parade.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://discover.kdf.org/pegasusparade/|title=Republic Bank Pegasus® Parade|last=|first=|date=|website=discover.kdf.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parade is held annually on the Thursday before Derby.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sports ===
Various sport competitions are held as part of the Festival. From 1973 to 2017, the Festival hosted the Kentucky Derby Festival [[Basketball]] Classic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/preps/kentucky/2018/02/01/kentucky-derby-festival-basketball-classic-canceled-2018/1087768001/|title=No hoops for you: Kentucky Derby Festival cancels high school basketball all-star game|work=The Courier-Journal|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1974, a [[Pro–am|pro-am]] [[golf]] tournament has been held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://discover.kdf.org/pro-am/|title=Kentucky Derby Festival® Foundation Pro-Am Golf Tournament|last=|first=|date=|website=discover.kdf.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Races ====
[[File:Great Balloon Race.jpg|thumb|225x225px|The Great Balloon Race]]A number of races take place in the festival. The Kentucky Derby Festival [[Mini marathon|miniMarathon]] and [[Marathon]] occur the Saturday before the Kentucky Derby; USA Track and Field named the miniMarathon among the nation's top 50 races.{{When?|date=April 2018}}{{Cn|date=April 2018}} The mini has been held since 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://derbyfestivalmarathon.com/history/|title=Race History|last=|first=|date=|website=derbyfestivalmarathon.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same Saturday is typically also when the Great [[Hot air ballooning|Balloon Race]] is held,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://discover.kdf.org/u-s-bank-great-balloon-race/|title=U.S. Bank Great BalloonFest: Great Balloon Race®|last=|first=|date=|website=discover.kdf.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the culmination of the hot air balloon-themed BalloonFest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://discover.kdf.org/u-s-bank-great-balloonfest/|title=U.S. Bank Great BalloonFest℠|last=|first=|date=|website=discover.kdf.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognition is given to Louisville's restaurant employees with the [[Run for the Rosé]], where waiters and waitresses run an [[obstacle course]] while carrying trays of glasses filled with White Zinfandel Wine.  Servers finishing with the best time and most wine remaining in the glasses win prizes.

For the annual [[bed]] races, businesses create themed mobile beds that are paraded before being race on an indoor track with costumed employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://discover.kdf.org/great-bed-races/|title=Thorntons Great Bed Races|last=|first=|date=|website=discover.kdf.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great [[Steamboat]] Race usually takes place in the week before Derby, where the [[Belle of Louisville]] typically takes on at least one challenger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://discover.kdf.org/great-steamboat-race/|title=Great Steamboat Race Presented by IBEW Local 369|last=|first=|date=|website=discover.kdf.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miscellenous ===

== Pegasus pins ==
Since 1973, KDF has sold a plastic [[Lapel pin|pin]] for the Kentucky Derby featuring a [[pegasus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pegasuspins.com/collector-info/pin-trading-schedule-price-guide/|title=Pin Trading, Schedule &amp; Price Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=pegasuspins.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pegasuspins.com/faqs/|title=Pegasus Pin FAQs|last=|first=|date=|website=pegasuspins.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pin is used as proof of purchase for admission to a number of the KDF events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pegasuspins.com/pegasus-pin-admission-events/|title=Pegasus Pin Admission Events|last=|first=|date=|website=pegasuspins.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derby cruising==
A controversial aspect of the Derby Festival is "Derby Cruising." Though it is not an official or licensed event during Derby Festival, it takes place in the historically black areas of West Broadway on Derby day and the Friday before it. Cruising consists of motorcycles and cars (many elaborately modified) driving slowly down Broadway, pedestrians crowding the sidewalks, and several blocks closed for a festival with rides and street vendors. The gridlock associated with cruising made it difficult for police to respond to instances of violence during 2005 Derby cruising. In 2006, police made an effort to stop cruising, shutting down Broadway except to [[emergency vehicle]]s, which resulted in suggestions of [[racial profiling]] and much public debate about the legitimacy of Broadway cruising as a free alternative to other festivities.&lt;ref name="cj070501"&gt;{{cite news|title= City can use plan to stop cruising|date=2007-05-01|author=Adams, Jim|publisher=[[Courier-Journal]]|pages=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, police announced similar plans, although slightly more of Broadway was to remain open, including access to [[Shawnee Park]]. The 2007 plan sparked a lawsuit by business owners and a [[civil rights]] foundation, claiming the shutdown of Broadway during Derby week violated their [[constitutional right]]s and cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars in business. A [[United States federal judge|federal judge]] allowed the plans to proceed, citing concerns about "public safety and the free flow of traffic".&lt;ref name="cj070501" /&gt;

In 2008, police again banned cruising, but with a new plan allowing traffic to flow but to have a high number of officers on hand to enforce the city's noise and cruising ordinances, the latter of which prevents vehicles from blocking a roadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cruising law stirs debate on fairness, clarity|date=2007-05-27|author=Adams, Jim|publisher=[[Courier-Journal]]|pages=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police reported that arrests were down from 2007, although they did shut down a 10-block portion of Broadway for a short time on Derby evening after gridlock developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cruising arrests down|publisher=[[Courier-Journal]]|author=Hershberg, Ben Zion|pages=5B|date=2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Macbeth''''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|k|ˈ|b|ɛ|θ}}; full title '''''The Tragedy of Macbeth''''') is a [[Shakespearean tragedy|tragedy]] by [[William Shakespeare]]; it is thought to have been first performed in [[1606 in literature|1606]].{{efn|For the first performance in 1607, see {{harvnb|Gurr|2009|p=293}}, {{harvnb|Thomson|1992|p=64}}, and {{harvnb|Wickham|1969|p=231}}. For the date of composition, see {{harvnb|Brooke|2008|p=1}} and {{harvnb|Clark|Mason|2015|p=13}}}} It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake. Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the [[Jacobean era|reign of James I]], who was patron of Shakespeare's [[playing company|acting company]], ''Macbeth'' most clearly reflects the playwright's relationship with his sovereign.{{sfn|Wickham|1969|p=231}} It was first published in the [[First Folio|Folio of 1623]], possibly from a [[prompt book]], and is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy.{{sfn|Clark|Mason|2015|p=1}}

Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife, Macbeth murders King Duncan and takes the Scottish throne for himself. He is then wracked with guilt and paranoia. Forced to commit more and more murders to protect himself from enmity and suspicion, he soon becomes a tyrannical ruler. The bloodbath and consequent civil war swiftly take Macbeth and Lady Macbeth into the realms of madness and death.

Shakespeare's source for the story is the account of [[Macbeth, King of Scotland]]; [[Macduff (Macbeth)|Macduff]]; and [[Duncan I of Scotland|Duncan]] in ''[[Holinshed's Chronicles]]'' (1587), a history of England, Scotland, and Ireland familiar to Shakespeare and his contemporaries, although the events in the play differ extensively from the history of the real Macbeth. The events of the tragedy are usually associated with the execution of [[Henry Garnet]] for complicity in the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605.{{sfn|Bloom|2008|p=41}}

In the backstage world of theatre, some believe that the play is cursed, and will not mention its title aloud, referring to it instead as "[[The Scottish Play]]". Over the course of many centuries, the play has attracted some of the most renowned actors to the roles of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. It has been adapted to film, television, [[Macbeth (opera)|opera]], novels, comics, and other media.

==Plot==
[[File:MacbethAndBanquo-Witches.jpg|thumb|Macbeth and Banquo encounter the witches for the first time]]

===Act I===

The play opens amid thunder and lightning, and the Three Witches decide that their next meeting will be with Macbeth. In the following scene, a wounded sergeant reports to King Duncan of Scotland that his generals Macbeth, who is the Thane of Glamis, and Banquo have just defeated the allied forces of Norway and Ireland, who were led by the traitorous Macdonwald, and the Thane of [[Cawdor]]. Macbeth, the King's kinsman, is praised for his bravery and fighting prowess.

In the following scene, Macbeth and Banquo discuss the weather and their victory. As they wander onto a heath, the Three Witches enter and greet them with prophecies. Though Banquo challenges them first, they address Macbeth, hailing him as "Thane of Glamis," "Thane of Cawdor," and that he will "be King hereafter." Macbeth appears to be stunned to silence. When Banquo asks of his own fortunes, the witches respond paradoxically, saying that he will be less than Macbeth, yet happier, less successful, yet more. He will father a line of kings, though he himself will not be one. While the two men wonder at these pronouncements, the witches vanish, and another thane, Ross, arrives and informs Macbeth of his newly bestowed title: Thane of Cawdor. The first prophecy is thus fulfilled, and Macbeth, previously sceptical, immediately begins to harbour ambitions of becoming king.

King Duncan welcomes and praises Macbeth and Banquo, and declares that he will spend the night at Macbeth's castle at [[Inverness]]; he also names his son Malcolm as his heir. Macbeth sends a message ahead to his wife, Lady Macbeth, telling her about the witches' prophecies. Lady Macbeth suffers none of her husband's uncertainty and wishes him to murder Duncan in order to obtain kingship. When Macbeth arrives at Inverness, she overrides all of her husband's objections by challenging his manhood and successfully persuades him to kill the king that very night. He and Lady Macbeth plan to get Duncan's two chamberlains drunk so that they will black out; the next morning they will blame the chamberlains for the murder. They will be defenceless as they will remember nothing.

===Act II===

While Duncan is asleep, Macbeth stabs him, despite his doubts and a number of supernatural portents, including a hallucination of a bloody dagger. He is so shaken that Lady Macbeth has to take charge. In accordance with her plan, she frames Duncan's sleeping servants for the murder by placing bloody daggers on them. Early the next morning, Lennox, a Scottish nobleman, and Macduff, the loyal Thane of Fife, arrive. A porter opens the gate and Macbeth leads them to the king's chamber, where Macduff discovers Duncan's body. Macbeth murders the guards to prevent them from professing their innocence, but claims he did so in a fit of anger over their misdeeds. Duncan's sons Malcolm and Donalbain flee to England and Ireland, respectively, fearing that whoever killed Duncan desires their demise as well. The rightful heirs' flight makes them suspects and Macbeth assumes the throne as the new King of Scotland as a kinsman of the dead king. Banquo reveals this to the audience, and while sceptical of the new King Macbeth, he remembers the witches' prophecy about how his own descendants would inherit the throne; this makes him suspicious of Macbeth.

===Act III===

Despite his success, Macbeth, also aware of this part of the prophecy, remains uneasy. Macbeth invites Banquo to a royal [[banquet]], where he discovers that Banquo and his young son, Fleance, will be riding out that night. Fearing Banquo's suspicions, Macbeth arranges to have him murdered, by hiring two men to kill them, later sending a [[Third Murderer]]. The assassins succeed in killing Banquo, but Fleance escapes. Macbeth becomes furious: he fears that his power remains insecure as long as an heir of Banquo remains alive.

At a banquet, Macbeth invites his lords and Lady Macbeth to a night of drinking and merriment. Banquo's [[Ghosts in European culture|ghost]] enters and sits in Macbeth's place. Macbeth raves fearfully, startling his guests, as the ghost is only visible to him. The others panic at the sight of Macbeth raging at an empty chair, until a desperate Lady Macbeth tells them that her husband is merely afflicted with a familiar and harmless malady. The ghost departs and returns once more, causing the same riotous anger and fear in Macbeth. This time, Lady Macbeth tells the lords to leave, and they do so.

===Act IV===

Macbeth, disturbed, visits the three witches once more and asks them to reveal the truth of their prophecies to him. To answer his questions, they summon horrible apparitions, each of which offers predictions and further prophecies to put Macbeth's fears at rest. First, they conjure an armoured head, which tells him to beware of Macduff (IV.i.72). Second, a bloody child tells him that no one born of a woman will be able to harm him. Thirdly, a crowned child holding a tree states that Macbeth will be safe until [[Birnam, Perth and Kinross|Great Birnam Wood]] comes to [[Dunsinane Hill]]. Macbeth is relieved and feels secure because he knows that all men are born of women and forests cannot move. Macbeth also asks whether Banquo's sons will ever reign in Scotland: the witches conjure a procession of eight crowned kings, all similar in appearance to Banquo, and the last carrying a mirror that reflects even more kings. Macbeth realises that these are all Banquo's descendants having acquired kingship in numerous countries. After the witches perform a mad dance and leave, Lennox enters and tells Macbeth that Macduff has fled to England. Macbeth orders Macduff's castle be seized, and, most cruelly, sends murderers to slaughter Macduff, as well as Macduff's wife and children. Although Macduff is no longer in the castle, everyone in Macduff's castle is put to death, including [[Lady Macduff]] and [[Macduff's son|their young son]].

[[File:Johann Heinrich Füssli 030.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Lady Macbeth sleepwalking'' by [[Henry Fuseli|Johann Heinrich Füssli]]]]

===Act V===

Meanwhile, Lady Macbeth becomes racked with guilt from the crimes she and her husband have committed. At night, in the king's palace at Dunsinane, a doctor and a gentlewoman discuss Lady Macbeth's strange habit of sleepwalking. Suddenly, Lady Macbeth enters in a trance with a candle in her hand. Bemoaning the murders of Duncan, Lady Macduff, and Banquo, she tries to wash off imaginary bloodstains from her hands, all the while speaking of the terrible things she knows she pressed her husband to do. She leaves, and the doctor and gentlewoman marvel at her descent into madness. Her belief that nothing can wash away the blood on her hands is an ironic reversal of her earlier claim to Macbeth that "[a] little water clears us of this deed" (II.ii.66).

In England, Macduff is informed by Ross that his "castle is surprised; wife and babes / Savagely slaughter'd" (IV.iii.204–05). When this news of his family's execution reaches him, Macduff is stricken with grief and vows revenge. Prince Malcolm, Duncan's son, has succeeded in raising an army in England, and Macduff joins him as he rides to Scotland to challenge Macbeth's forces. The invasion has the support of the Scottish nobles, who are appalled and frightened by Macbeth's tyrannical and murderous behaviour. Malcolm leads an army, along with Macduff and Englishmen [[Sigurd the Dane|Siward]] (the Elder), the [[Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]], against Dunsinane Castle. While encamped in Birnam Wood, the soldiers are ordered to cut down and carry tree limbs to camouflage their numbers.

Before Macbeth's opponents arrive, he receives news that Lady Macbeth has killed herself, causing him to sink into a deep and pessimistic despair and deliver his "[[Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow]]" [[soliloquy]] (V.v.17–28). Though he reflects on the brevity and meaninglessness of life, he nevertheless awaits the English and fortifies Dunsinane. He is certain that the witches' prophecies guarantee his invincibility, but is struck with fear when he learns that the English army is advancing on Dunsinane shielded with boughs cut from Birnam Wood, in apparent fulfillment of one of the prophecies.

A battle culminates in Macduff's confrontation with Macbeth, who kills Young Siward in combat. The English forces overwhelm his army and castle. Macbeth boasts that he has no reason to fear Macduff, for he cannot be killed by any man born of woman. Macduff declares that he was "from his mother's womb / Untimely ripp'd" (V.8.15–16), (i.e., born by [[Caesarean section]]) and is not "of woman born" (an example of a [[quibble (plot device)|literary quibble]]), fulfilling the second prophecy. Macbeth realises too late that he has misinterpreted the witches' words. Though he realises that he is doomed, he continues to fight. Macduff kills and beheads him, thus fulfilling the remaining prophecy.

Macduff carries Macbeth's head onstage and Malcolm discusses how order has been restored. His last reference to Lady Macbeth, however, reveals "'tis thought, by self and violent hands / Took off her life" (V.ix.71–72), but the method of her suicide is undisclosed. Malcolm, now the King of Scotland, declares his benevolent intentions for the country and invites all to see him crowned at [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]].

Although Malcolm, and not Fleance, is placed on the throne, the witches' prophecy concerning Banquo ("Thou shalt get kings") was known to the audience of Shakespeare's time to be true: James VI of Scotland (later also [[James VI and I|James I of England]]) was supposedly a descendant of Banquo.{{sfn|Muir|1984|p=xxxvi}}

A principal source comes from the ''[[Daemonologie]]'' of [[James VI and I|King James]] published in 1597 which included a news pamphlet titled ''[[Newes from Scotland]]'' that detailed the famous [[North Berwick Witch Trials]] of 1590.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1008940058|title=The annotated Daemonologie : a critical edition|last=King of England|first=James I|date=2016|publisher=|others=Warren, Brett. R,|year=|isbn=9781532968914|location=|pages=|oclc=1008940058}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of ''Daemonologie'' came just a few years before the tragedy of ''Macbeth'' with the themes and setting in a direct and comparative contrast with King James' personal experiences with witchcraft. Not only had this trial taken place in Scotland, the witches involved were recorded to have also conducted rituals with the same mannerisms as the three witches. One of the evidenced passages is referenced when the witches involved in the trial confessed to attempt the use of witchcraft to raise a tempest and sabotage the very boat King James and his queen were on board during their return trip from [[Denmark]]. This was significant as one ship sailing with King James' fleet actually sank in the storm. The following quote from ''Macbeth'' is one such reference:{{sfn|Warren|2016|p=107}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"purposely to be cassin into the sea to raise winds for destruction of ships."&lt;ref&gt;''Macbeth'', I.III.15–25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Macbeth'' has been compared to Shakespeare's ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]].'' Both Antony and Macbeth as characters seek a new world, even at the cost of the old one. Both are fighting for a throne and have a 'nemesis' to face to achieve that throne. For Antony, the nemesis is Octavius; for Macbeth, it is Banquo. At one point Macbeth even compares himself to Antony, saying "under Banquo / My Genius is rebuk'd, as it is said / Mark Antony's was by Caesar." Lastly, both plays contain powerful and manipulative female figures: Cleopatra and Lady Macbeth.{{sfn|Coursen|1997|pp=11–13}}

Shakespeare borrowed the story from several tales in ''[[Holinshed's Chronicles]]'', a popular history of the British Isles well known to Shakespeare and his contemporaries. In ''Chronicles'', a man named Donwald finds several of his family put to death by his king, [[Dub, King of Scotland|King Duff]], for dealing with witches. After being pressured by his wife, he and four of his servants kill the King in his own house. In ''Chronicles'', Macbeth is portrayed as struggling to support the kingdom in the face of King Duncan's ineptitude. He and Banquo meet the three witches, who make exactly the same prophecies as in Shakespeare's version. Macbeth and Banquo then together plot the murder of Duncan, at Lady Macbeth's urging. Macbeth has a long, ten-year reign before eventually being overthrown by Macduff and Malcolm. The parallels between the two versions are clear. However, some scholars think that [[George Buchanan]]'s ''[[Rerum Scoticarum Historia]]'' matches Shakespeare's version more closely. Buchanan's work was available in Latin in Shakespeare's day.{{sfn|Coursen|1997|pp=15–21}}

No medieval account of the reign of Macbeth mentions the Weird Sisters, Banquo or Lady Macbeth, and with the exception of the latter none actually existed.{{sfn|Thrasher|2002|p=37}} The characters of Banquo, the Weird Sisters and Lady Macbeth were first mentioned in 1527 by a Scottish historian [[Hector Boece]] in his book ''Historia Gentis Scotorum'' (''History of the Scottish People'') who wanted to denigrate Macbeth in order to strengthen the claim of the House of Stewart to the Scottish throne.{{sfn|Thrasher|2002|p=37}} Boece portrayed Banquo as an ancestor of the Stewart kings of Scotland, adding in a "prophecy" that the descendants of Banquo would be the rightful kings of Scotland while the Weird Sisters served to give a picture of King Macbeth as gaining the throne via dark supernatural forces.{{sfn|Thrasher|2002|p=37}} Macbeth did have a wife, but it not clear if she was as power-hungry and ambitious as Boece portrayed her, which served his purpose of having even Macbeth realise he lacked a proper claim to the throne, and only took it at the urging of his wife.{{sfn|Thrasher|2002|p=37}} Holinshed accepted Boece's version of Macbeth's reign at face value and included it in his ''Chronicles''.{{sfn|Thrasher|2002|p=37}} Shakespeare saw the dramatic possibilities in the story as related by Holinshed, and used it as the basis for the play.{{sfn|Thrasher|2002|p=37}}

No other version of the story has Macbeth kill the king in Macbeth's own castle. Scholars have seen this change of Shakespeare's as adding to the darkness of Macbeth's crime as the worst violation of hospitality. Versions of the story that were common at the time had Duncan being killed in an ambush at [[Inverness]], not in a castle. Shakespeare conflated the story of Donwald and King Duff in what was a significant change to the story.{{sfn|Coursen|1997|p=17}}

Shakespeare made another important change. In ''Chronicles'', Banquo is an accomplice in Macbeth's murder of King Duncan, and plays an important part in ensuring that Macbeth, not Malcolm, takes the throne in the coup that follows.{{sfn|Nagarajan|1956}} In Shakespeare's day, Banquo was thought to be an ancestor of the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] King James I.{{sfn|Palmer|1886}} (In the 19th century it was established that Banquo is an unhistorical character, the Stuarts are actually descended from a Breton family which migrated to Scotland slightly later than Macbeth's time.) The Banquo portrayed in earlier sources is significantly different from the Banquo created by Shakespeare. Critics have proposed several reasons for this change. First, to portray the king's ancestor as a murderer would have been risky. Other authors of the time who wrote about Banquo, such as [[Jean de Schelandre]] in his ''Stuartide'', also changed history by portraying Banquo as a noble man, not a murderer, probably for the same reasons.{{sfn|Maskell|1971}} Second, Shakespeare may have altered Banquo's character simply because there was no dramatic need for another accomplice to the murder; there was, however, a need to give a dramatic contrast to Macbeth—a role which many scholars argue is filled by Banquo.{{sfn|Nagarajan|1956}}

Other scholars maintain that a strong argument can be made for associating the tragedy with the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605.{{sfn|Bloom|2008|p=41}} As presented by Harold Bloom in 2008: "[S]cholars cite the existence of several topical references in ''Macbeth'' to the events of that year, namely the execution of the Father Henry Garnett for his alleged complicity in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, as referenced in the porter's scene."{{sfn|Bloom|2008|p=41}} Those arrested for their role in the Gunpowder Plot refused to give direct answers to the questions posed to them by their interrogators, which reflected the influence of the Jesuit practice of [[equivocation]].{{sfn|Thrasher|2002|p=42}} Shakespeare by having Macbeth say that demons "palter...in a double sense" and "keep the promise to our ear/And break it to our hope" confirmed James's belief that equivocation was a "wicked" practice, which reflected in turn the "wickedness" of the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Thrasher|2002|p=42}} Garnett had in his possession ''A Treatise on Equivocation'', and in the play the Weird Sisters often engage in equivocation, for instance telling Macbeth that he could never be overthrown until "Great Birnan wood to high Dunsinane hill/Shall Come".{{sfn|Thrasher|2002|p=38-39}} Macbeth interprets the prophecy as meaning never, but in fact, the Three Sisters refer only to branches of the trees of Great Birnan coming to Dunsinane hill.{{sfn|Thrasher|2002|p=38}}

==Date and text==
''Macbeth'' cannot be dated precisely but it is usually dated as contemporaneous to the other canonical tragedies (''King Lear'', ''Hamlet'', and ''Othello'').{{sfn|Wells|Taylor|2005|pp=909, 1153}} Some scholars have placed the original writing of the play as early as 1599.{{sfn|Bloom|2008|p=41}} As the play is widely seen to celebrate King James' ancestors and the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] accession to the throne in 1603 (James believed himself to be descended from [[Banquo]]),{{sfn|Braunmuller|1997|pp=2–3}} most scholars believe that the play is unlikely to have been composed earlier than 1603 and suggest that the parade of eight kings—which the witches show Macbeth in a vision in Act IV—is a compliment to King James. Many scholars think the play was written in 1606 in the aftermath of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] because of possible internal allusions to the 1605 plot and its ensuing trials.{{sfn|Brooke|2008|pp=59–64}} In fact, there are a great number of allusions and possible pieces of evidence alluding to the Plot, and, for this reason, a great many critics agree that ''Macbeth'' was written in the year 1606.{{sfn|Wills|1996|p=7}}{{sfn|Muir|1985|p=48}}{{sfn|Taylor|Jowett|1993|p=85}} Lady Macbeth's instructions to her husband, "Look like the innocent flower, but be the serpent under't" (1.5.74–75), may be an allusion to a medal that was struck in 1605 to commemorate King James' escape that depicted a serpent hiding among lilies and roses.{{sfn|Paul|1950|p=227}}

Particularly, the Porter's speech (2.3.1–21) in which he welcomes an "equivocator", a farmer, and a tailor to hell (2.3.8–13), has been argued to be an allusion to the 28 March 1606 trial and execution on 3 May 1606 of the Jesuit [[Henry Garnet]], who used the alias "Farmer", with "equivocator" referring to Garnet's defence of [[Mental reservation|"equivocation"]].{{sfn|Kermode|1974|p=1308}}{{sfn|Braunmuller|1997|pp=5–8}}{{efn|For details on Garnet, see Perez Zagorin's article, "The Historical Significance of Lying and Dissimulation" (1996), in ''[[Social Research]]''.{{sfn|Zagorin|1996}}}} The porter says that the equivocator "committed treason enough for God's sake" (2.3.9–10), which specifically connects equivocation and treason and ties it to the Jesuit belief that equivocation was only lawful when used "for God's sake", strengthening the allusion to Garnet. The porter goes on to say that the equivocator "yet could not equivocate to heaven" (2.3.10–11), echoing grim jokes that were current on the eve of Garnet's execution: i.e. that Garnet would be "hanged without equivocation" and at his execution he was asked "not to equivocate with his last breath."{{sfn|Rogers|1965|pp=44–45}} The "English tailor" the porter admits to hell (2.3.13), has been seen as an allusion to Hugh Griffin, a tailor who was questioned by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] on 27 November and 3 December 1607 for the part he played in Garnet's "miraculous straw", an infamous head of straw that was stained with Garnet's blood that had congealed into a form resembling Garnet's portrait, which was hailed by Catholics as a miracle. The tailor Griffin became notorious and the subject of verses published with his portrait on the title page.{{sfn|Rogers|1965|pp=45–47}}

When James became king of England, a feeling of uncertainty settled over the nation. James was a Scottish king and the son of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], a staunch Catholic and English traitor. In the words of critic [[Robert Crawford (Scottish poet)|Robert Crawford]], "''Macbeth'' was a play for a post-Elizabethan England facing up to what it might mean to have a Scottish king. England seems comparatively benign, while its northern neighbour is mired in a bloody, monarch-killing past. ... ''Macbeth'' may have been set in medieval Scotland, but it was filled with material of interest to England and England's ruler."{{sfn|Crawford|2010}} Critics argue that the content of the play is clearly a message to James, the new Scottish King of England. Likewise, the critic Andrew Hadfield noted the contrast the play draws between the saintly King Edward the Confessor of England who has the power of the royal touch to cure scrofula and whose realm is portrayed as peaceful and prosperous vs. the bloody chaos of Scotland.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=84-85}} James in his 1598 book ''The Trew Law of Free Monarchies'' had asserted that kings are always right, if not just, and his subjects own him total loyalty at all times, writing that even if a king is a tyrant, his subjects must never rebel and just endure his tyranny for their own good.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=84}} James had argued that the tyranny was preferable to the problems caused by rebellion which were even worse; Shakespeare by contrast in ''Macbeth'' argued for the right of the subjects to overthrow a tyrant king, in what appeared to be an implied criticism of James's theories if applied to England.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=84}} Hadfield also noted a curious aspect of the play in that it implies that primogeniture is the norm in Scotland, but Duncan has to nominate his son Malcolm to be his successor while Macbeth is accepted without protest by the Scottish lairds as their king despite being an usurper.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=85}} Hadfield argued this aspect of the play with the thanes apparently choosing their king was a reference to the Stuart claim to the English throne, and the attempts of the English parliament to block the succession of James's Catholic mother, Mary, Queen of Scots, from succeeding to the English throne.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=86}} Hadfield argued that Shakespeare that implying that James was indeed the rightful king of England, but he owned his throne not to divine favor as James would have it, but rather due to the willingness of the English Parliament to accept the Protestant son of the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, as their king.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=86}}

Garry Wills provides further evidence that ''Macbeth'' is a Gunpowder Play (a type of play that emerged immediately following the events of the Gunpowder Plot). He points out that every Gunpowder Play contains "a necromancy scene, regicide attempted or completed, references to equivocation, scenes that test loyalty by use of deceptive language, and a character who sees through plots—along with a vocabulary similar to the Plot in its immediate aftermath (words like ''train, blow, vault'') and an ironic recoil of the Plot upon the Plotters (who fall into the pit they dug)."{{sfn|Wills|1996|p=7}}

The play utilizes a few key words that the audience at the time would recognize as allusions to the Plot. In one sermon in 1605, [[Lancelot Andrewes]] stated, regarding the failure of the Plotters on God's day, "Be they fair or foul, glad or sad (as the poet calleth Him) the great Diespiter, 'the Father of days' hath made them both."{{sfn|Harris|2007|pp=473–474}} Shakespeare begins the play by using the words "fair" and "foul" in the first speeches of the witches and Macbeth. In the words of Jonathan Gil Harris, the play expresses the "horror unleashed by a supposedly loyal subject who seeks to kill a king and the treasonous role of equivocation. The play even echoes certain keywords from the scandal&amp;nbsp;– the 'vault' beneath the House of Parliament in which Guy Fawkes stored thirty kegs of gunpowder and the 'blow' about which one of the conspirators had secretly warned a relative who planned to attend the House of Parliament on 5 November...Even though the Plot is never alluded to directly, its presence is everywhere in the play, like a pervasive odor."{{sfn|Harris|2007|pp=473–474}}

[[File:Second Folio Title Page of Macbeth.jpg|thumb|left|The first page of ''Macbeth'', printed in the Second Folio of 1632]]
Scholars also cite an entertainment seen by King James at [[Oxford]] in the summer of 1605 that featured three "[[sibyl]]s" like the weird sisters; Kermode surmises that Shakespeare could have heard about this and alluded to it with the weird sisters.{{sfn|Kermode|1974|p=1308}} However, A. R. Braunmuller in the New Cambridge edition finds the 1605–06 arguments inconclusive, and argues only for an earliest date of 1603.{{sfn|Braunmuller|1997|pp=5–8}}

One suggested allusion supporting a date in late 1606 is the first witch's dialogue about a sailor's wife: "'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries./Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the ''Tiger''" (1.3.6–7). This has been thought to allude to the ''Tiger'', a ship that returned to England 27 June 1606 after a disastrous voyage in which many of the crew were killed by pirates. A few lines later the witch speaks of the sailor, "He shall live a man forbid:/Weary se'nnights nine times nine" (1.3.21–22). The real ship was at sea 567 days, the product of 7x9x9, which has been taken as a confirmation of the allusion, which if correct, confirms that the witch scenes were either written or amended later than July 1606.{{sfn|Loomis|1956}}{{sfn|Brooke|2008|pp=59–64}}

The play is not considered to have been written any later than 1607, since, as Kermode notes, there are "fairly clear allusions to the play in 1607."{{sfn|Kermode|1974|p=1308}} One notable reference is in [[Francis Beaumont]]'s ''[[Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'', first performed in 1607.{{sfn|Whitted|2012}}{{sfn|Smith|2012}} The following lines (Act V, Scene 1, 24–30) are, according to scholars,{{sfn|Dyce|1843|p=216}}{{sfn|Sprague|1889|p=12}} a clear allusion to the scene in which Banquo's ghost haunts Macbeth at the dinner table:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
When thou art at thy table with thy friends,
Merry in heart, and filled with swelling wine,
I'll come in midst of all thy pride and mirth,
Invisible to all men but thyself,
And whisper such a sad tale in thine ear
Shall make thee let the cup fall from thy hand,
And stand as mute and pale as death itself.{{sfn|Hattaway|1969|p=100}}&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Macbeth'' was first printed in the [[First Folio]] of 1623 and the Folio is the only source for the text. Some scholars contend that the Folio text was abridged and rearranged from an earlier manuscript or prompt book.{{sfn|Clark|Mason|2015|p=321}} Often cited as interpolation are stage cues for two songs, whose lyrics are not included in the Folio but are included in [[Thomas Middleton]]'s play ''[[The Witch (play)|The Witch]]'', which was written between the accepted date for ''Macbeth'' (1606) and the printing of the Folio.{{sfn|Clark|Mason|2015|p=325}} Many scholars believe these songs were editorially inserted into the Folio, though whether they were Middleton's songs or preexisting songs is not certain.{{sfn|Clark|Mason|2015|pp=326–329}} It is also widely believed that the character of [[Hecate#Hecate in literature|Hecate]], as well as some lines of the First Witch (4.1 124–31), were not part of Shakespeare's original play but were added by the Folio editors and possibly written by Middleton,{{sfn|Brooke|2008|p=57}} though "there is no completely objective proof" of such interpolation.{{sfn|Clark|Mason|2015|pp=329–335}}

==Pronunciations==
The 'reconstructive movement' was concerned with the recreation of Elizabethan acting conditions, and would eventually lead to the creation of [[Shakespeare's Globe]] and similar replicas. One of the movement's offshoots was in the reconstruction of Elizabethan pronunciation: for example [[Bernard Miles]]' 1951 ''Macbeth'', for which linguists from [[University College London]] were employed to create a transcript of the play in Elizabethan&lt;!-- This is the term used in the source: I don't think the slight anachronism (Elizabeth died before Macbeth was written) needs any comment or correction in the body text. --&gt; English, then an audio recording of that transcription, from which the actors, in turn, learned their lines.{{sfn|O'Connor|2002|pp=83, 92–93}}

The pronunciation of many words evolves over time. In Shakespeare's day, for example, "heath" was pronounced as "heth" ("or a slightly elongated 'e' as in the modern 'get'"),{{sfn|Papadinis|2012|p=31}} so it rhymed with "Macbeth" in the sentences by the Witches at the beginning of the play:{{sfn|Price|2014}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Second Witch''': Upon the heath.&lt;br /&gt;'''Third Witch''': There to meet with Macbeth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A scholar of antique pronunciation writes, "''Heath'' would have made a close (if not exact) rhyme with the "-eth" of ''Macbeth'', which was pronounced with a short 'i' as in 'it'."{{sfn|Papadinis|2012|p=31}}

In the theatre programme notes, "much was made of how OP [Original Pronunciation] performance reintroduces lost rhymes such as the final couplet: 'So thanks to all at once, and each to one, / Whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone'" (5.11.40–41) where 'one' sounds like 'own'. The Witches, the play's great purveyors of rhyme, benefited most in this regard. So, 'babe' (4.1.30) sounded like 'bab' and rhymed with 'drab' (4.1.31)..."{{sfn|Price|2014}}

Eoin Price wrote, "I found the OP rendition of Banquo's brilliant question 'Or have we eaten on the insane root / That takes the raison prisoner?' unduly amusing"; and he adds,

&lt;blockquote&gt;:... 'fear' had two pronunciations: the standard modern pronunciation being one, and 'fair' being the other. Mostly, the actors seemed to pronounce it in a way which accords with the modern standard, but during one speech, Macbeth said 'fair'. This seems especially significant in a play determined to complicate the relationship between 'fair' and 'foul'. I wonder, then, if the punning could be extended throughout the production. Would Banquo's lines, 'Good sir, why do you start and seem to fear / Things that do sound so fair?' (1.3.49–50) be fascinatingly illuminated, or merely muddled, by this punning? Perhaps this is a possibility the cast already experimented with and chose to discard, but, for sure, an awareness of the possibility of a 'fair/fear' pun can have interesting ramifications for the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bloggingshakespeare.com/reviewing-shakespeare/macbeth-original-pronunciation-shakespeares-globe-sam-wanamaker-playhouse-2014/ |title=''Macbeth'' in Original Pronunciation (Shakespeare's Globe) @ Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, 2014 |last=Price |first=Eoin |date=2014 |website=Reviewing Shakespeare |publisher=Blogging Shakespeare |access-date=25 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Macbeth'' is an anomaly among Shakespeare's tragedies in certain critical ways. It is short: more than a thousand lines shorter than ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[King Lear]]'', and only slightly more than half as long as ''[[Hamlet]]''. This brevity has suggested to many critics that the received version is based on a heavily cut source, perhaps a prompt-book for a particular performance. This would reflect other Shakespearean plays existing in both Quarto and the Folio, where the Quarto versions are usually longer than the Folio versions. ''Macbeth'' was first printed in the First Folio, but has no Quarto version&amp;nbsp;– if there were a Quarto, it would probably be longer than the Folio version.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, AC, ''Shakespearean Tragedy''&lt;/ref&gt; That brevity has also been connected to other unusual features: the fast pace of the first act, which has seemed to be "stripped for action"; the comparative flatness of the characters other than Macbeth;{{sfn|Stoll|1943|p=26}}&lt;!-- Arthur Quiller-Couch, cited in Stoll, discusses this at more length. --&gt; and the oddness of Macbeth himself compared with other Shakespearean tragic heroes.{{clarify|reason=Why is he odd? Needs elaboration|date=September 2014}} [[A. C. Bradley]], in considering this question, concluded the play "always was an extremely short one", noting the witch scenes and battle scenes would have taken up some time in performance, remarking, "I do not think that, in reading, we ''feel'' Macbeth to be short: certainly we are astonished when we hear it is about half as long as ''Hamlet''. Perhaps in the Shakespearean theatre too it seemed to occupy a longer time than the clock recorded."&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, AC, ''Shakespearean Tragedy''&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a tragedy of character===
At least since the days of [[Alexander Pope]] and [[Samuel Johnson]], analysis of the play has centred on the question of Macbeth's ambition, commonly seen as so dominant a trait that it defines the character.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Johnson asserted that Macbeth, though esteemed for his military bravery, is wholly reviled.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

This opinion recurs in critical literature, and, according to [[Caroline Spurgeon]], is supported by Shakespeare himself, who apparently intended to degrade his hero by vesting him with clothes unsuited to him and to make Macbeth look ridiculous by several [[nimism]]s he applies: His garments seem either too big or too small for him&amp;nbsp;– as his ambition is too big and his character too small for his new and unrightful role as king. When he feels as if "dressed in borrowed robes", after his new title as Thane of Cawdor, prophesied by the witches, has been confirmed by Ross (I, 3, ll. 108–09), Banquo comments: &lt;blockquote&gt;"New honours come upon him,&lt;br&gt;Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould,&lt;br&gt;But with the aid of use" (I, 3, ll. 145–46).&lt;/blockquote&gt; And, at the end, when the tyrant is at bay at Dunsinane, Caithness sees him as a man trying in vain to fasten a large garment on him with too small a belt: &lt;blockquote&gt;"He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause &lt;br&gt; Within the belt of rule" (V, 2, ll. 14–15)&lt;/blockquote&gt; while Angus, in a similar nimism, sums up what everybody thinks ever since Macbeth's accession to power: &lt;blockquote&gt;"now does he feel his title &lt;br&gt; Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe &lt;br&gt; upon a dwarfish thief" (V, 2, ll. 18–20).{{sfn|Spurgeon|1935|pp=324–327}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], but without that character's perversely appealing exuberance, Macbeth wades through blood until his inevitable fall. As Kenneth Muir writes, "Macbeth has not a predisposition to murder; he has merely an inordinate ambition that makes murder itself seem to be a lesser evil than failure to achieve the crown."{{Sfn|Muir|1984|p=xlviii}} Some critics, such as E. E. Stoll, explain this characterisation as a holdover from Senecan or medieval tradition. Shakespeare's audience, in this view, expected villains to be wholly bad, and Senecan style, far from prohibiting a villainous protagonist, all but demanded it.{{sfn|Stoll|1943|p=26}}&lt;!-- Stoll doesn't make this connection explicit: he discusses Macbeth as a tragic hero that commits villainous acts, and discusses Aristotelan (Senecan, in practice) primacy of plot over character (Stoll is responding to psychological readings), but doesn't, here, say that Shakespeare was writing to an audience expectation of a villainous protagonist. He makes that connection elsewhere though (From Shakespeare to Joyce, Shakespeare and Other Masters). --&gt;

Yet for other critics, it has not been so easy to resolve the question of Macbeth's motivation. [[Robert Bridges]], for instance, perceived a paradox: a character able to express such convincing horror before Duncan's murder would likely be incapable of committing the crime.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} For many critics, Macbeth's motivations in the first act appear vague and insufficient. [[John Dover Wilson]] hypothesised that Shakespeare's original text had an extra scene or scenes where husband and wife discussed their plans.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} This interpretation is not fully provable; however, the motivating role of ambition for Macbeth is universally recognised. The evil actions motivated by his ambition seem to trap him in a cycle of increasing evil, as Macbeth himself recognises: &lt;blockquote&gt;"I am in blood&lt;br&gt;Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,&lt;br&gt; Returning were as tedious as go o'er."{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While working on Russian translations of Shakespeare's works, [[Boris Pasternak]] compared Macbeth to [[Raskolnikov]], the protagonist of ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' by [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]. Pasternak argues that "neither Macbeth or Raskolnikov is a born criminal or a villain by nature. They are turned into criminals by faulty rationalizations, by deductions from false premises." He goes on to argue that Lady Macbeth is "feminine&amp;nbsp;... one of those active, insistent wives" who becomes her husband's "executive, more resolute and consistent than he is himself." According to Pasternak, she is only helping Macbeth carry out his own wishes, to her own detriment.{{sfn|Pasternak|1959|pp=150–152}}

===As a tragedy of moral order===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
The disastrous consequences of Macbeth's ambition are not limited to him. Almost from the moment of the murder, the play depicts Scotland as a land shaken by inversions of the natural order. Shakespeare may have intended a reference to the [[great chain of being]], although the play's images of disorder are mostly not specific enough to support detailed intellectual readings. He may also have intended an elaborate compliment to James's belief in the [[divine right of kings]], although this hypothesis, outlined at greatest length by Henry N. Paul, is not universally accepted. As in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', though, perturbations in the political sphere are echoed and even amplified by events in the material world. Among the most often depicted of the inversions of the natural order is sleep. Macbeth's announcement that he has "murdered sleep" is figuratively mirrored in Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking.

''Macbeth'''s generally accepted indebtedness to medieval tragedy is often seen as significant in the play's treatment of moral order. Glynne Wickham connects the play, through the Porter, to a [[mystery play]] on the [[harrowing of hell]]. Howard Felperin argues that the play has a more complex attitude toward "orthodox Christian tragedy" than is often admitted; he sees a kinship between the play and the [[Herod the Great|tyrant plays]] within the medieval liturgical drama.

The theme of androgyny is often seen as a special aspect of the theme of disorder. Inversion of normative gender roles is most famously associated with the witches and with Lady Macbeth as she appears in the first act. Whatever Shakespeare's degree of sympathy with such inversions, the play ends with a thorough return to normative gender values. Some [[feminist literary criticism|feminist]] [[psychoanalytic literary criticism|psychoanalytic]] critics, such as Janet Adelman, have connected the play's treatment of gender roles to its larger theme of inverted natural order. In this light, Macbeth is punished for his violation of the moral order by being removed from the cycles of nature (which are figured as female); nature itself (as embodied in the movement of Birnam Wood) is part of the restoration of moral order.

===As a poetic tragedy===
Critics in the early twentieth century reacted against what they saw as an excessive dependence on the study of character in criticism of the play. This dependence, though most closely associated with [[Andrew Cecil Bradley]], is clear as early as the time of [[Mary Cowden Clarke]], who offered precise, if fanciful, accounts of the predramatic lives of Shakespeare's female leads. She suggested, for instance, that the child Lady Macbeth refers to in the first act died during a foolish military action.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Witchcraft and evil===
[[File:Macbeth and Banquo with the witches JHF.jpg|thumb|''Macbeth and Banquo with the Witches'' by [[Henry Fuseli]]]]

In the play, the Three Witches represent darkness, chaos, and conflict, while their role is as agents and witnesses.{{sfn|Kliman|Santos|2005|p=14}} Their presence communicates treason and impending doom. During Shakespeare's day, witches were seen as worse than rebels, "the most notorious traytor and rebell that can be."{{sfn|Perkins|1610|p=53}} They were not only political traitors, but spiritual traitors as well. Much of the confusion that springs from them comes from their ability to straddle the play's borders between reality and the supernatural. They are so deeply entrenched in both worlds that it is unclear whether they control fate, or whether they are merely its agents. They defy logic, not being subject to the rules of the real world.{{sfn|Coddon|1989|p=491}} The witches' lines in the first act: "Fair is foul, and foul is fair: Hover through the fog and filthy air" are often said to set the tone for the rest of the play by establishing a sense of confusion. Indeed, the play is filled with situations where evil is depicted as good, while good is rendered evil. The line "Double, double toil and trouble," communicates the witches' intent clearly: they seek only trouble for the mortals around them.{{sfn|Frye|1987}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}} The witches' spells are remarkably similar to the spells of the witch Medusa in Anthony Munday's play ''[[Fidele and Fortunio]]'' published in 1584, and Shakespeare may have been influenced by these.

While the witches do not tell Macbeth directly to kill King Duncan, they use a subtle form of temptation when they tell Macbeth that he is destined to be king. By placing this thought in his mind, they effectively guide him on the path to his own destruction. This follows the pattern of temptation used at the time of Shakespeare. First, they argued, a thought is put in a man's mind, then the person may either indulge in the thought or reject it. Macbeth indulges in it, while Banquo rejects.{{sfn|Frye|1987}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}

According to J. A. Bryant Jr., Macbeth also makes use of Biblical parallels, notably between King Duncan's murder and the murder of [[Christ]]:

{{quote|No matter how one looks at it, whether as history or as tragedy, Macbeth is distinctively Christian. One may simply count the Biblical allusions as Richmond Noble has done; one may go further and study the parallels between Shakespeare's story and the Old Testament stories of [[Saul]] and [[Jezebel]] as Miss Jane H. Jack has done; or one may examine with W. C. Curry the progressive degeneration of Macbeth from the point of view of medieval theology.{{sfn|Bryant|1961|p=153}}|sign=|source=}}

==Superstition and "The Scottish Play"==
{{Main|The Scottish Play}}

While many today would say that any misfortune surrounding a production is mere coincidence, actors and others in the theatre industry often consider it bad luck to mention ''Macbeth'' by name while inside a theatre, and sometimes refer to it indirectly, for example as "[[The Scottish Play]]",{{sfn|Faires|2000}} or "MacBee", or when referring to the character and not the play, "Mr. and Mrs. M", or "The Scottish King".

This is because Shakespeare (or the play's revisers) are said to have used the spells of real witches in his text, purportedly angering the witches and causing them to curse the play.{{sfn|Tritsch|1984}}{{better source|date=January 2018}} Thus, to say the name of the play inside a theatre is believed to doom the production to failure, and perhaps cause physical injury or death to cast members. There are stories of accidents, misfortunes and even deaths taking place during runs of ''Macbeth''.{{sfn|Faires|2000}}

According to the actor Sir [[Donald Sinden]], in his [[Sky Arts]] TV series ''[[Great West End Theatres]]'', &lt;blockquote&gt;contrary to popular myth, Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth is not the unluckiest play as superstition likes to portray it. Exactly the opposite! The origin of the unfortunate moniker dates back to repertory theatre days when each town and village had at least one theatre to entertain the public. If a play was not doing well, it would invariably get 'pulled' and replaced with a sure-fire audience pleaser&amp;nbsp;– Macbeth guaranteed full-houses. So when the weekly theatre newspaper, ''[[The Stage]]'' was published, listing what was on in each theatre in the country, it was instantly noticed what shows had ''not'' worked the previous week, as they had been replaced by a definite crowd-pleaser. More actors have died during performances of Hamlet than in the "Scottish play" as the profession still calls it. It is forbidden to quote from it backstage as this could cause the current play to collapse and have to be replaced, causing possible unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;''Great West End Theatres'' Sky Arts. 10 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- FIXME: this quote is somewhat excessive, and Sir Donald, bless him, is not a particularly scholarly source. --&gt;

Several methods exist to dispel the curse, depending on the actor. One, attributed to [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]], is to immediately leave the building the stage is in with the person who uttered the name, walk around it three times, spit over their left shoulders, say an obscenity then wait to be invited back into the building.{{sfn|Straczynski|2006}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}} A related practice is to spin around three times as fast as possible on the spot, sometimes accompanied by spitting over their shoulder, and uttering an obscenity. Another popular "ritual" is to leave the room, knock three times, be invited in, and then quote a line from ''[[Hamlet]]''. Yet another is to recite lines from ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', thought to be a lucky play.{{sfn|Garber|2008|p=77}}

==Legacy==
===Performance history===
====Shakespeare's day to the Interregnum====
The only eyewitness account of ''Macbeth'' in Shakespeare's lifetime was recorded by [[Simon Forman]], who saw a performance at [[Globe Theatre|the Globe]] on 20 April 1610.{{sfn|Brooke|2008|p=36}}{{sfn|Clark|Mason|2015|p=337}} Scholars have noted discrepancies between Forman's account and the play as it appears in the Folio. For example, he makes no mention of the apparition scene, or of Hecate,{{sfn|Clark|Mason|2015|p=324}} of the man not of woman born, or of Birnam Wood.{{sfn|Brooke|2008|p=36}}{{sfn|Orgel|2002|p=33}} However, Clark{{sfn|Clark|Mason|2015|p=301}} observes that Forman's accounts were often inaccurate and incomplete (for instance omitting the statue scene from ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'') and his interest did not seem to be in "giving full accounts of the productions."{{sfn|Clark|Mason|2015|p=324}}

As mentioned above, the Folio text is thought by some to be an alteration of the original play. This has led to the theory that the play as we know it from the Folio was an adaptation for indoor performance at the [[Blackfriars Theatre]] (which was operated by the King's Men from 1608)&amp;nbsp;– and even speculation that it represents a specific performance before King James.{{sfn|Brooke|2008|pp=34–36}}{{sfn|Orgel|2002|pp=158–161}}{{sfn|Taylor|2002|p=2}} The play contains more musical [[Cue (theatrical)|cues]] than any other play in the canon as well as a significant use of [[sound effect]]s.{{sfn|Brooke|2008|pp=35–36}}

====Restoration and eighteenth century====

{{quote box|width=23em|"The chill of the grave seemed about you when you looked on her; there was the hush and damp of the charnel house at midnight ... your flesh crept and your breathing became uneasy ... the scent of blood became palpable to you."|—Sheridan Knowles on [[Sarah Siddons]]' sleepwalking scene{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=119}}}}

All theatres were closed down by the [[Puritan]] government on 6 September 1642. Upon the [[English Restoration|restoration]] of the monarchy in 1660, two [[patent theatre|patent companies]] (the [[King's Company]] and the [[Duke's Company]]) were established, and the existing theatrical repertoire divided between them.{{sfn|Marsden|2002|p=21}} [[William Davenant|Sir William Davenant]], founder of the Duke's Company, adapted Shakespeare's play to the tastes of the new era, and his version would dominate on stage for around eighty years. Among the changes he made were the expansion of the role of the witches, introducing new songs, dances and 'flying', and the expansion of the role of Lady Macduff as a foil to Lady Macbeth.{{sfn|Tatspaugh|2003|pp=526–527}} There were, however, performances outside the patent companies: among the evasions of the Duke's Company's monopoly was a puppet version of ''Macbeth''.{{sfn|Lanier|2002|pp=28–29}}

''Macbeth'' was a favourite of the seventeenth-century diarist [[Samuel Pepys]], who saw the play on 5 November 1664 ("admirably acted"), 28 December 1666 ("most excellently acted"), ten days later on 7 January 1667 ("though I saw it lately, yet [it] appears a most excellent play in all respects"), on 19 April 1667 ("one of the best plays for a stage ... that ever I saw"), again on 16 October 1667 ("was vexed to see Young, who is but a bad actor at best, act Macbeth in the room of [[Thomas Betterton|Betterton]], who, poor man! is sick"), and again three weeks later on 6 November 1667 ("[at] ''Macbeth'', which we still like mightily"), yet again on 12 August 1668 ("saw ''Macbeth'', to our great content"), and finally on 21 December 1668, on which date the [[Charles II of England|king]] and court were also present in the audience.{{sfn|Orgel|2002|p=155}}

The first professional performances of ''Macbeth'' in North America were probably those of [[Old American Company|The Hallam Company]].{{sfn|Morrison|2002|pp=231–232}}

In 1744, [[David Garrick]] revived the play, abandoning Davenant's version and instead advertising it "as written by Shakespeare". In fact this claim was largely false: he retained much of Davenant's more popular business for the witches, and himself wrote a lengthy death speech for Macbeth. And he cut more than 10% of Shakespeare's play, including the drunken porter, the murder of Lady Macduff's son, and Malcolm's testing of Macduff.{{sfn|Orgel|2002|p=246}} [[Hannah Pritchard]] was his greatest stage partner, having her premiere as his Lady Macbeth in 1747. He would later drop the play from his repertoire upon her retirement from the stage.{{sfn|Potter|2001|p=188}} Mrs. Pritchard was the first actress to achieve acclaim in the role of Lady Macbeth&amp;nbsp;– at least partly due to the removal of Davenant's material, which made irrelevant moral contrasts with Lady Macduff.{{sfn|Gay|2002|p=158}} Garrick's portrayal focused on the inner life of the character, endowing him with an innocence vacillating between good and evil, and betrayed by outside influences. He portrayed a man capable of observing himself, as if a part of him remained untouched by what he had done, the play moulding him into a man of sensibility, rather than him descending into a tyrant.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=124}}

[[John Philip Kemble]] first played Macbeth in 1778.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=125}} Although usually regarded as the antithesis of Garrick, Kemble nevertheless refined aspects of Garrick's portrayal into his own.{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=124–125}} However it was the "towering and majestic" [[Sarah Siddons]] (Kemble's sister) who became a legend in the role of Lady Macbeth.{{sfn|Potter|2001|p=189}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=125–126}} In contrast to Hannah Pritchard's savage, demonic portrayal, Siddons' Lady Macbeth, while terrifying, was nevertheless&amp;nbsp;– in the scenes in which she expresses her regret and remorse&amp;nbsp;– tenderly human.{{sfn|Moody|2002|p=43}} And in portraying her actions as done out of love for her husband, Siddons deflected from him some of the moral responsibility for the play's carnage.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=125}} Audiences seem to have found the sleepwalking scene particularly mesmerising: [[William Hazlitt|Hazlitt]] said of it that "all her gestures were involuntary and mechanical ... She glided on and off the stage almost like an apparition."{{sfn|Gay|2002|p=159}}

In 1794, Kemble dispensed with the ghost of Banquo altogether, allowing the audience to see Macbeth's reaction as his wife and guests see it, and relying upon the fact that the play was so well known that his audience would already be aware that a ghost enters at that point.{{sfn|McLuskie|2005|pp=256–257}}

[[Ferdinand Fleck]], notable as the first German actor to present Shakespeare's tragic roles in their fullness, played Macbeth at the Berlin National Theatre from 1787. Unlike his English counterparts, he portrayed the character as achieving his stature after the murder of Duncan, growing in presence and confidence: thereby enabling stark contrasts, such as in the banquet scene, which he ended babbling like a child.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=126}}

====Nineteenth century====

{{quote box|width=23em|"Everyone seems to think Mrs McB is a ''Monstrousness'' &amp; ''I'' can only see she's a ''woman''&amp;nbsp;– a mistaken woman&amp;nbsp;– &amp; ''weak''&amp;nbsp;– not a Dove&amp;nbsp;– of course not&amp;nbsp;– ''but first of all a wife.''"|—[[Ellen Terry]]{{sfn|Gay|2002|p=167}}}}

Performances outside the patent theatres were instrumental in bringing the monopoly to an end. [[Robert William Elliston|Robert Elliston]], for example, produced a popular adaptation of ''Macbeth'' in 1809 at the [[Surrey Theatre|Royal Circus]] described in its publicity as "this matchless piece of pantomimic and choral performance", which circumvented the illegality of speaking Shakespeare's words through mimed action, singing, and doggerel verse written by J. C. Cross.{{sfn|Holland|2007|pp=38–39}}{{sfn|Moody|2002|pp=38–39}}

In 1809, in an unsuccessful attempt to take [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] upmarket, [[John Philip Kemble|Kemble]] installed private boxes, increasing admission prices to pay for the improvements. The inaugural run at the newly renovated theatre was ''Macbeth'', which was disrupted for over two months with cries of "Old prices!" and "No private boxes!" until Kemble capitulated to the protestors' demands.{{sfn|Lanier|2002|p=37}}

[[Edmund Kean]] at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] gave a psychological portrayal of the central character, with a common touch, but was ultimately unsuccessful in the role. However he did pave the way for the most acclaimed performance of the nineteenth century, that of [[William Macready|William Charles Macready]]. Macready played the role over a 30-year period, firstly at Covent Garden in 1820 and finally in his retirement performance. Although his playing evolved over the years, it was noted throughout for the tension between the idealistic aspects and the weaker, venal aspects of Macbeth's character. His staging was full of spectacle, including several elaborate royal processions.{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=126–127}}

In 1843 the [[Theatres Act 1843|Theatres Regulation Act]] finally brought the patent companies' monopoly to an end.{{sfn|Moody|2002|p=38}} From that time until the end of the [[Victorian era]], London theatre was dominated by the [[actor-manager]]s, and the style of presentation was "pictorial"&amp;nbsp;– [[proscenium]] stages filled with spectacular stage-pictures, often featuring complex scenery, large casts in elaborate costumes, and frequent use of [[Tableau vivant|tableaux vivant]].{{sfn|Schoch|2002|pp=58–59}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=128}} [[Charles Kean]] (son of Edmund), at London's [[Princess's Theatre, London|Princess's Theatre]] from 1850 to 1859, took an antiquarian view of Shakespeare performance, setting his ''Macbeth'' in a historically accurate eleventh-century Scotland.{{sfn|Schoch|2002|pp=61–62}} His leading lady, [[Ellen Kean|Ellen Tree]], created a sense of the character's inner life: ''[[The Times]]''{{'}} critic saying "The countenance which she assumed ... when luring on Macbeth in his course of crime, was actually appalling in intensity, as if it denoted a hunger after guilt."{{sfn|Gay|2002|pp=163–164}} At the same time, special effects were becoming popular: for example in [[Samuel Phelps]]' ''Macbeth'' the witches performed behind green [[gauze]], enabling them to appear and disappear using stage lighting.{{sfn|Schoch|2002|p=64}}

In 1849, rival performances of the play sparked the [[Astor Place riot]] in [[Manhattan]]. The popular American actor [[Edwin Forrest]], whose Macbeth was said to be like "the ferocious chief of a barbarous tribe"{{sfn|Morrison|2002|p=237}} played the central role at the Broadway Theatre to popular acclaim, while the "cerebral and patrician"{{sfn|Lanier|2002|p=37}} English actor [[William Macready|Macready]], playing the same role at the [[Astor Opera House|Astor Place Opera House]], suffered constant heckling. The existing enmity between the two men (Forrest had openly hissed Macready at a recent performance of ''[[Hamlet]]'' in Britain) was taken up by Forrest's supporters&amp;nbsp;– formed from the working class and lower middle class and anti-British agitators, keen to attack the upper-class pro-British patrons of the Opera House and the colonially-minded Macready. Nevertheless, Macready performed the role again three days later to a packed house while an angry mob gathered outside. The militia tasked with controlling the situation fired into the mob. In total, 31 rioters were killed and over 100 injured.{{sfn|Lanier|2002|p=37}}{{sfn|Booth|2001|pp=311–312}}{{sfn|Holland|2002|p=202}}{{sfn|Morrison|2002|p=238}}&lt;!-- Note that these sources are in disagreement about the number of casualties: Lanier says 21. --&gt;&lt;!-- And, yes, you do need all four of these sources to get every point made in this paragraph! --&gt;

[[Charlotte Cushman]] is unique among nineteenth century interpreters of Shakespeare in achieving stardom in roles of both genders. Her New York debut was as Lady Macbeth in 1836, and she would later be admired in London in the same role in the mid-1840s.{{sfn|Morrison|2002|p=239}}{{sfn|Gay|2002|p=162}} [[Helena Faucit|Helen Faucit]] was considered the embodiment of early-Victorian notions of femininity. But for this reason she largely failed when she eventually played Lady Macbeth in 1864: her serious attempt to embody the coarser aspects of Lady Macbeth's character jarred harshly with her public image.{{sfn|Gay|2002|pp=161–162}} [[Adelaide Ristori]], the great Italian actress, brought her Lady Macbeth to London in 1863 in Italian, and again in 1873 in an English translation cut in such a way as to be, in effect, Lady Macbeth's tragedy.{{sfn|Gay|2002|p=164}}

[[File:Ellen Terry plays Lady Macbeth.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph of [[Ellen Terry]] as Lady Macbeth, an 1888 production]]

[[Henry Irving]] was the most successful of the late-Victorian [[actor-manager]]s, but his ''Macbeth'' failed to curry favour with audiences. His desire for psychological credibility reduced certain aspects of the role: He described Macbeth as a brave soldier but a moral coward, and played him untroubled by conscience&amp;nbsp;– clearly already contemplating the murder of Duncan before his encounter with the witches.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=129}}{{efn|Similar criticisms were made of [[Friedrich Mitterwurzer]] in Germany, whose performances of ''Macbeth'' had many unintentional parallels with Irving's.{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=129–130}}}} Irving's leading lady was [[Ellen Terry]], but her Lady Macbeth was unsuccessful with the public, for whom a century of performances influenced by Sarah Siddons had created expectations at odds with Terry's conception of the role.{{sfn|Gay|2002|pp=166–167}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=130}}

Late nineteenth-century European Macbeths aimed for heroic stature, but at the expense of subtlety: [[Tommaso Salvini]] in Italy and [[Adalbert Matkowsky]] in Germany were said to inspire awe, but elicited little pity.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=130}}

====20th century to present====
{{quote box|width=23em|"And then Lady Macbeth says 'He that's coming / Must be provided for.' It's an amazing line. She's going to play hostess to Duncan at Dunsinane, and 'provide' is what gracious hostesses always do. It's a wonder of a line to play because the reverberations do the acting for you, make the audience go 'Aaaagh!'"|—[[Sinéad Cusack]]{{sfn|McLuskie|2005|p=253}}}}

Two developments changed the nature of ''Macbeth'' performance in the 20th century: first, developments in the craft of acting itself, especially the ideas of [[Konstantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]] and [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]]; and second, the rise of the dictator as a political icon. The latter has not always assisted the performance: it is difficult to sympathise with a Macbeth based on Hitler, Stalin, or Idi Amin.{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=130–131}}

[[Barry Jackson (director)|Barry Jackson]], at the [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre]] in 1923, was the first of the 20th-century directors to costume ''Macbeth'' in [[modern dress]].{{sfn|Smallwood|2002|p=102}}

[[File:Macbeth-26A-Carter-Thomas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jack Carter (actor)|Jack Carter]] and Edna Thomas in the [[Federal Theatre Project]] production that came to be known as the ''[[Voodoo Macbeth]]'' (1936)]]

In 1936, a decade before his film adaptation of the play, [[Orson Welles]] directed ''Macbeth'' for the [[Federal Theatre Project#African-American theatre|Negro Theatre Unit]] of the [[Federal Theatre Project]] at the [[Lafayette Theatre (Harlem)|Lafayette Theatre]] in Harlem, using black actors and setting the action in Haiti: with drums and [[Haitian Vodou|Voodoo]] rituals to establish the Witches scenes. The production, dubbed ''The [[Voodoo Macbeth]]'', proved inflammatory in the aftermath of the [[Harlem Riot of 1935|Harlem riots]], accused of making fun of black culture and as "a campaign to burlesque negroes" until Welles persuaded crowds that his use of black actors and voodoo made important cultural statements.{{sfn|Forsyth|2007|p=284}}{{sfn|Hawkes|2003|p=577}}

[[File:Fort St. Catherine's, St. George's Island, Bermuda.jpg|thumb|left|Fort St. Catherine's, Bermuda, the site of a 1953 outdoor production]]
A performance which is frequently referenced as an example of the play's curse was the outdoor production directed by [[Burgess Meredith]] in 1953 in the [[British Overseas Territory|British colony]] of [[Bermuda]], starring [[Charlton Heston]]. Using the imposing spectacle of [[Fort St. Catherine]] as a key element of the set, the production was plagued by a host of mishaps, including Charlton Heston being burned when his tights caught fire.{{sfn|Hardy|2014}}{{sfn|Bernews|2013}}

The critical consensus is that there have been three great Macbeths on the English-speaking stage in the 20th century, all of them commencing at [[Stratford-upon-Avon]]: [[Laurence Olivier]] in 1955, [[Ian McKellen]] in 1976 and [[Antony Sher]] in 1999.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=131}} Olivier's portrayal (directed by [[Glen Byam Shaw]], with [[Vivien Leigh]] as Lady Macbeth) was immediately hailed as a masterpiece. [[Kenneth Tynan]] expressed the view that it succeeded because Olivier built the role to a climax at the end of the play, whereas most actors spend all they have in the first two acts.{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=130–131}}{{sfn|Brooke|2008|pp=47–48}}

The play caused grave difficulties for the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], especially at the (then) [[Royal Shakespeare Theatre|Shakespeare Memorial Theatre]]. [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]]'s 1967 production was (in Michael Billington's words) "an acknowledged disaster" with the use of real leaves from Birnham Wood getting unsolicited first-night laughs, and [[Trevor Nunn]]'s 1974 production was (Billington again) "an over-elaborate religious spectacle".{{sfn|Billington|2003|p=599}}

But Nunn achieved success for the RSC in his 1976 production at the intimate [[The Other Place (theatre)|Other Place]], with [[Ian McKellen]] and [[Judi Dench]] in the central roles.{{sfn|Billington|2003|pp=599–600}} A small cast worked within a simple circle, and McKellen's Macbeth had nothing noble or likeable about him, being a manipulator in a world of manipulative characters. They were a young couple, physically passionate, "not monsters but recognisable human beings",{{efn|Michael Billington, cited by Gay.{{sfn|Gay|2002|p=169}}}} but their relationship atrophied as the action progressed.{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=132–134}}{{sfn|Gay|2002|p=169}}

The [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]] again achieved critical success in [[Gregory Doran]]'s 1999 production at [[Swan Theatre (Stratford)|The Swan]], with [[Antony Sher]] and [[Harriet Walter]] in the central roles, once again demonstrating the suitability of the play for smaller venues.{{sfn|Walter|2002|p=1}}{{sfn|Billington|2003|p=600}} Doran's witches spoke their lines to a theatre in absolute darkness, and the opening visual image was the entrance of Macbeth and Banquo in the berets and fatigues of modern warfare, carried on the shoulders of triumphant troops.{{sfn|Billington|2003|p=600}} In contrast to Nunn, Doran presented a world in which king Duncan and his soldiers were ultimately benign and honest, heightening the deviance of Macbeth (who seems genuinely surprised by the witches' prophesies) and Lady Macbeth in plotting to kill the king. The play said little about politics, instead powerfully presenting its central characters' psychological collapse.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=134}}

In Soviet-controlled Prague in 1977, faced with the illegality of working in theatres, [[Pavel Kohout]] adapted ''Macbeth'' into a 75-minute abridgement for five actors, suitable for "bringing a show in a suitcase to people's homes".{{sfn|Holland|2007|p=40}}{{efn|See also [[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''[[Dogg's Hamlet, Cahoot's Macbeth]]''.}}

Spectacle was unfashionable in Western theatre throughout the 20th century. In East Asia, however, spectacular productions have achieved great success, including [[Yukio Ninagawa]]'s 1980 production with [[Masane Tsukayama]] as Macbeth, set in the 16th century [[Sengoku period|Japanese Civil War]].{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=134–135}} The same director's tour of London in 1987 was widely praised by critics, even though (like most of their audience) they were unable to understand the significance of Macbeth's gestures, the huge Buddhist altar dominating the set, or the petals falling from the cherry trees.{{sfn|Holland|2002|p=207}}

[[Xu Xiaozhong]]'s 1980 [[Central Academy of Drama]] production in Beijing made every effort to be unpolitical (necessary in the aftermath of the [[Cultural Revolution]]): yet audiences still perceived correspondences between the central character (whom the director had actually modelled on [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon]]) and [[Mao Zedong]].{{sfn|Gillies|Minami|Li|Trivedi|2002|p=268}} Shakespeare has often been adapted to indigenous theatre traditions, for example the ''[[Kunqu|Kunju]] Macbeth'' of [[Huang Zuolin]] performed at the inaugural Chinese Shakespeare Festival of 1986.{{sfn|Gillies|Minami|Li|Trivedi|2002|p=270}} Similarly, [[B. V. Karanth]]'s ''Barnam Vana'' of 1979 had adapted ''Macbeth'' to the [[Yakshagana]] tradition of [[Karnataka]], India.{{sfn|Gillies|Minami|Li|Trivedi|2002|pp=276–278}} In 1997, [[Lokendra Arambam]] created ''Stage of Blood'', merging a range of martial arts, dance and gymnastic styles from [[Manipur]], performed in [[Imphal]] and in England. The stage was literally a raft on a lake.{{sfn|Gillies|Minami|Li|Trivedi|2002|pp=278–279}}

''[[Throne of Blood]]'' (蜘蛛巣城 Kumonosu-jō, ''Spider Web Castle'') is a 1957 Japanese samurai film co-written and directed by [[Akira Kurosawa]]. The film transposes Macbeth from Medieval Scotland to feudal Japan, with stylistic elements drawn from Noh drama.  Kurosawa was a fan of the play and planned his own adaptation for several years, postponing it after learning of Orson Welles' Macbeth (1948). The film won two Mainichi Film Awards.

The play has been translated and performed in various languages in different parts of the world, and ''Media Artists'' was the first to stage its [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] adaptation in [[India]]. The adaptation by Balram and the play directed by [[Samuel John]] have been universally acknowledged as a milestone in Punjabi theatre.{{sfn|The Tribune|2006}} The unique attempt involved trained theatre experts and the actors taken from a rural background in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]. Punjabi folk music imbued the play with the native ethos as the Scottish setting of Shakespeare's play was transposed into a Punjabi milieu.{{sfn|Tandon|2004}}

'''Marwan ibn Muhammad's invasion of Georgia''' took place from 735 to 737. It was initiated by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. The goals of the campaign are disputed among historians. The Georgian historiography insists its main purpose was to finally break the stiff Georgian resistance against [[Arab rule in Georgia|Arab rule]],&lt;ref&gt;Georgian Soviet Encyclopedia, Vol. 7, pg. 199, Tb., 1984&lt;/ref&gt; however, the western historians such as Cyril Toumanoff,&lt;ref name="Toumanoff1963"&gt;[[Cyril Toumanoff|Toumanoff, Cyril]], "Iberia between Chosroid and Bagratid Rule", in ''Studies in Christian Caucasian History'', Georgetown, 1963, p. 405. Accessible online at {{cite web|url=http://rbedrosian.com/Ref/Toumicb/toumicb.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208043427/http://rbedrosian.com/Ref/Toumicb/toumicb.html |archivedate=2012-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ronald Suny,&lt;ref name="Suny1994"&gt;[[Ronald Grigor Suny|Suny, Ronald Grigor]] (1994), ''The Making of the Georgian Nation: 2nd edition'', p. 28. [[Indiana University Press]], {{ISBN|0253209153}}&lt;/ref&gt; view it as a general campaign directed at both the [[Byzantine Empire]], who exerted dominion over [[Lazica|Western Georgia]], and the [[Khazars]], whose repeated raids affected not only [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]] (Eastern Georgia) and the whole [[Caucasus]], but had in 730 reached Arab lands all the way to [[Mosul]].

==The invasion==
The invasion was led by Marwan ibn Muhammad, who later became the last Umayyad caliph [[Marwan II]]. He first campaigned in [[Kartli]], after which he led his armies to the west and besieged the fortress of [[New Athos|Anakopia]], where [[Archil of Kakheti]] and his brother [[Mihr of Kakheti|Mihr]], who were assisted by [[Leon I of Abkhazia]], were stationed. The Arabs failed to take the fortress and were forced to retreat. Fearing an onslaught, large numbers of Georgians fled to the mountainous regions. Marwan later invaded [[Samtskhe]], encamped in [[Odzrkhe]] and led his forces against the princes of [[Argveti]], Constantine and David, from whom, upon their capture, he demanded unconditional conversion to Islam, which both refused. He tortured and then killed them for their refusal. After that, Marwan took Tshkumi (modern [[Sukhumi]]) and [[Nokalakevi|Tsikhegoji]] and again turned to Anakopia. The Georgians fought fiercely and the Arabs were powerless to take the fortress, especially after heavy rains and floods began. The Arabs retreated with heavy losses.

==Legacy==
Marwan's cruelty and ruthlessness was epitomized by the [[Georgian people|Georgians]] by naming him ''Marwan the deaf''. After his campaign, most major settlements were utterly ruined and people faced starvation. If Georgian historiography insists that Kartli was devastated by the invasion, Toumanoff, relying on local and Arab sources, claims that most of the damage in the Eastern part of the country was actually the result of the previous Khazar raids, and that the local Georgian prince, [[Guaram III of Iberia]], actually sided with the Arabs in order to repeal them beyond the Caucasian range.&lt;ref&gt;Toumanoff 1963, p. 405, note 54&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the Arab intervention gave them more power over Iberia than they had managed to attain in almost a century of previous conquests. They established the [[Emirate of Tbilisi]] to exert direct control over Iberia, even though the [[Principate of Iberia]] was not abolished, and local nobility retained most of their power. Because civil instability and foreign enemies were plaguing the caliphate, it was unable to launch another invasion and until 786 settled upon receiving irregular tributes from the Georgian local princes.

'''Megatripolis''' was an underground London nightclub created by [[Encyclopaedia Psychedelica]]/Evolution editor and founder of the [[Zippie]] movement [[Fraser Clark]],&lt;ref&gt;Raynolds, Simon "Energy Flash", page 287 Picardor 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and partner Sionaidh Craigen as well as a great many others.&lt;ref&gt;Others involved at the beginning of the club included Allen Hyman, Marcus Pennell, Andy Lockwood, the Scooby Doobies, Matthew Freeth, Martin Kavanagh, Lucy Wills, Dorcas Perry, Martin and Lynn Tucker, Alistair Brook, Des O'Leary (and other members of the Evolution collective), Tribal Energy, Nik Sequenci, Eenasul Fateh and others&lt;/ref&gt; The club combined [[New Age]] ideology with [[Rave]] culture to create a vibrant, festival-like atmosphere presenting a wide variety of cross-cultural ideas and experiences. [[Club night]]s ran regularly on Thursdays from 1993 until 1996, being the focus of much of the Zippie movement. The club and its related activities also helped to popularise ideas such as [[cyberculture]] and the Internet between those years.

==History and venues==
The club first started at [[The Marquee]] in London when it was at 105 [[Charing Cross Road]]. Promoted by evolution / dream, and at first as a collaboration with Tribal Energy on Thursday nights in June 1993. The club hosted a lecture by [[Terence McKenna]] on its opening night. with DJ's, Sequenci, Mark Sinclair, Tribal Energy (Jez Turner), Solar Quest and Mixmaster Morris and featured an "ambient space" in the foyer and a "smart bar" on the terrace which sold various herbal drinks. With techno music playing, about 250 people attended. 

The club ran weekly. After eight weeks, a disagreement between the Tribal Energy and Evolution / dream crews led to a split. Tribal Energy then continued at the Marquee with a club on the same night, called 'Metropolis', which ran for seven weeks before closing. The Evolution / dream crew consolidated and grew at the so-called Stanstead Tree Party in September 1993 – a protest event to prevent woods near [[Stanstead Airport]] in Essex being cleared to make way for housing development. 

On 21 October 1993, the [[Heaven nightclub]] under [[Charing Cross Station]] became home to the club. 4,000 people attended for the free opening night. Heaven was London's original gay-only nightclub, but had run non-gay (known as Pyramid) nights for many years, including clubs such as Rage, Earth, Spectrum and Land of Oz. The club had the distinction of being full or almost full for every night of its 155-week run at Heaven.

The Megatripolis 'Festival in a box' on Thursday nights attracted a diverse audience from a wide age range, many of whom would not otherwise have considered going clubbing.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} By early 1994, it had also taken over the adjoining Sound Shaft nightclub and turned it into an ambient space with frequent all-night sets by [[Mixmaster Morris]] on the club's fourth separate sound stage. The club had many resident DJ's from across the broad spectrum of London's underground music scene. Megatripolis also promoted several large parties at Bagley's in [[Kings Cross, London|Kings Cross]] and escalated its political agenda by renting an armoured car for the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill]] protest rally in July 1994. 

The club ran until New Year's 1995 when internal pressures forced it to continue with a diminished agenda, the club eventually closing on Thursday, 24 October 1996, the club's third birthday. A three-CD album representing the club's music was released in July 1996 on Funky Peace Productions 2000 featuring mixes by DJ regulars and packaged in [[hemp]] (tree-free) paper (re-released in 2013 as the 'mega-t' album).&lt;ref&gt;mega-t album [http://www.megatalbum.com www.megatalbum.com]&lt;/ref&gt; All production equipment owned by the club was distributed to members of the club's crew. The rented premises under St.Pancras station were handed over to what was to become "Escape from Samsara".

Megatripolis events were also staged monthly in Manchester, and at least once at The Rocket in North London.

==Culture and Events==
Megatripolis proved popular, although some reporting of it suggested a conflict between an avowed downplay of psychedelic drugs and an enthusiasm for substance use by some club-goers.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC Two]] "yoof" [[DEF II]] news programme [[Reportage]], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nPTWOCUqsY Reportage on Megatripolis]&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, the club provided a meeting place of like-minded people and served as a platform for social awareness and activism as well as more traditional nightclub fare.

Typical evenings combined lectures and workshops with live musical performances accompanied by live video mixing and theatre. Musical styles were diverse, and included [[progressive house]], [[Trance music|trance]], [[deep house]], [[minimal techno]] and [[Dub_(music)|dub]]. The club played a seminal role in promoting [[trance music]]. Visits from speakers such as [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Terence McKenna]], [[George Monbiot]], [[Howard Marks]] and [[Ram Dass]] were common. Ginsberg's 1995 appearance was made into the film ''[[Allen Ginsberg Live in London]]''. 

Guest DJs included James Munroe, [[Colin Faver]], Colin Dale, [[Alex Paterson]], [[Andrew Weatherall]], [[Mr. C]], Tsuyoshi Suzuki, Youth, and many others, but also featured nights when Dragonfly T.I.P or Flying Rhino records took over the main dance floor which was the birth of Psychedelic Trance, the upgrade of Goa Trance. The club's resident DJ's were Darius Akashic, Sequenci, Richard Grey, and Marco Arnaldi. at least one of them was on the main dance floor every week. Marcus Pennell was resident VJ. Atmospheric music combined with sound effects was played along to films in the "chill-out rooms" set apart from the dance floors. 

New-age stalls occupied the central hallway selling non-alcoholic energy (or "smart") drinks, body jewellery, alternative "small press" comics and magazines (such as the short-lived, but influential Head Magazine), as well as T-shirts and other clothing. The club also encouraged face and body painters, massage therapists, healers and magicians. 

Also notable were early demonstrations of the [[World Wide Web]] at a time when most patrons were just beginning to be aware of what was then termed [[cyberculture]], something seen as an important, if not defining, part of the Zippie future. Underground bulletin boards such as London's pHreak hosted live "cyber events" from the club. In what was seen as very progressive at the time, a live video interview with [[Arthur C Clarke]] was conducted from his home in Sri Lanka&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXWgGfY7fGc Video clip Sir Arthur C Clarke from Sri Lanka – as above]&lt;/ref&gt; on a portable satellite phone system. Similarly, Timothy Leary was transmitted into the club via ISDN giving a video interview from his home in the Los Angeles hills, [[ISDN]] having been installed at his house for the link. Leary had been banned from entering the UK in person by the British government in the 1960s, a ban that was still in force at the time. The Dalai Lama also gave a lecture at the club from the Barbican via ISDN on Thursday 18 July 1996. 

Environmental issues were an important part of the club's remit and another part of the Zippie agenda. Anti-road protests were advertised on its internal noticeboards, hemp fashion shows were staged, environmental lectures and debates took place in the talk room called "The Well", and bicycle-powered sound-systems played on several occasions in various rooms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/women/story/0,,268300,00.html Disco divas turn the tables, Guardian, 24 August 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; megatripolis was a key mover in climate change promotion from this time.

A UK tour took place in the spring / summer of 1996 including venues such as the Hacienda, Manchester, Junction, Cambridge, and others. Two gigs were also held at the Mad club in Athens, Greece in 1996.

==Megatripolis West==
An offshoot of the club was started by Fraser Clark and others, in San Francisco in late 1994. It ran for five consecutive weeks before closing.

The sixth and final night of the club was a "launch rave" hosted by [[Ronin Publishing]] for [[Timothy Leary]]'s book ''Chaos And Cyber Culture''. In true "illegal UK rave" tradition, patrons were given the event's location at a nearby burger joint. Leary jammed and performed jazz skat with famous Bay Area musician ''Maruga''. He was later kidnapped by the Zippie Soundsystem and forced to release a statement condemning the UK Prime Minister [[John Major]] and the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which famously banned outdoor parties with music that included an "emission of a succession of repetitive beats".  

Leary exerted a powerful influence over the philosophy of the club and the [[Zippie]] movement overall. An indication of this can be found in the introduction to his posthumous book ''The Fugitive Philosopher'' (''Ronin Press'', September 2007) written by Fraser Clark. The original title of the piece, published in Clark's online magazine the ''UP!''[http://www.parallel-youniversity.com], was ''Timothy Leary Was A Saint Who Will Be Remembered &amp; Celebrated Long After Jesus, Mohamed and Elvis Are Forgotten''

==Megatripolis in popular culture==
Megatripolis is referenced in the BBC TV comedy '[[Absolutely Fabulous]]', and on the Red Hot Chili Peppers album '[[Stadium Arcadium]]'.
Well-known people who attended the club as visitors included [[Malcolm Mclaren]], [[Lynne Franks]], [[The Pet Shop Boys]], [[Björk]], [[Heather Small]], and Sir [[Richard Branson]].

==Megatripolis Reunion Benefit for Fraser Clark==
In 2008 Fraser Clark announced that he had inoperable liver cancer. In farewell to him, a final Megatripolis was held at Heaven on 13 November. He died on 21 January 2009.

'''Murder of pregnant women''' is a type of [[homicide]] often resulting from [[domestic violence]]. Domestic violence&amp;mdash;or [[intimate partner violence]] (IPV)&amp;mdash;is suffered by many, and when analyzing cases in which victims came forward, majority of them are women.{{Citation needed|reason= 221 studies say otherwise: http://web.csulb.edu/~mfiebert/assault.htm|date=March 2017}} Many of these women fear harm not just to themselves but also to their unborn children. Recently, more focus has been placed on pregnancy-associated deaths due to violence.&lt;ref name="Martin, SL 2007"&gt;Martin, S. L., Macy, R. J., Sullivan, K., and Magee, M. L. (2007) Pregnancy-Associated Violent Deaths: The Role of Intimate Partner Violence. Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse. (8), 135-148.&lt;/ref&gt; IPV may begin when the victim becomes pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, B., McFarlane, J., and Soeken, K. (1994) Abuse During Pregnancy: Effects on Maternal Complications and Birth Weight in Adult and Teenage Women. Obstet Gynecol. 323-328.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has shown that abuse while pregnant is a red flag for pregnancy-associated homicide.&lt;ref name="Campbell, JC 2007"&gt;Campbell, J. C., Glass, N., Sharps, P. W., Laughon, K., and Bloom, T. (2007) Intimate Partner Homicide: Review and Implications of Research and Policy. Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse. (8), 246-269.&lt;/ref&gt;

The murder of pregnant women represents a relatively recently studied class of [[murder]]. Limited statistics are available as there is no reliable system in place yet to track such cases.&lt;ref name="Wash Post"&gt;{{cite web|first=Donna|last=St. George|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10074-2004Dec18.html|title=Many New or Expectant Mothers Die Violent Deaths|publisher=''[[Washington Post]]''|date=December 19, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether [[pregnancy]] is a [[Causality|causal factor]] is hard to determine.

==Statistics==
ABC News have reported that studies in Maryland, New York, and Chicago found that approximately 20 percent of women who die during pregnancy are victims of murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3316485&amp;page=1&amp;GMA=true|title=Murder Is One of Top Causes of Death for Pregnant Women|date=June 26, 2007|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' examined death-record data across the US which documented the killings of 1,367 pregnant women and new mothers since 1990. The newspaper reports:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he killings span racial and ethnic groups. In cases whose details were known, 67 percent of women were killed with firearms. Many women were slain at home &amp;mdash; in bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens &amp;mdash; usually by men they knew. Husbands. Boyfriends. Lovers.&lt;ref name="Wash Post"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Isabelle Horon and Diana Cheng of the [[Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene]] conducted a study of pregnancy-associated deaths in [[Maryland]] between 1993 and 1998, defining pregnancy-associated death as death during pregnancy or within a year of pregnancy ending. They found that homicide was the leading cause of pregnancy-associated death, accounting for 20% of such deaths. In contrast, homicide was only the fifth leading cause of death for women of reproductive age who had not been pregnant in the year previous to their death, and accounted for 6.4% of deaths in this group. The second leading cause of pregnancy-associated death, heart disease, accounted for 19%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horon|first=Isabelle L.|last2=Cheng|first2=Diana|date=2001|title=Enhanced Surveillance for Pregnancy-Associated Mortality—Maryland, 1993-1998|url=http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/193666|journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]|volume=285|pages=1455–1459|doi=10.1001/jama.285.11.1455}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20010320/number-1-cause-of-death-in-pregnant-women-murder|title=No. 1 Cause of Death in Pregnant Women: Murder|author=|date=|website=webmd.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study using data from the District of Columbia also found that homicide was the leading cause of pregnancy-associated death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krulewitch|first=Cara J.|last2=Pierre-Louis|first2=Marie Lydie|last3=de Leon-Gomez|first3=Regina|last4=Guy|first4=Richard|last5=Green|first5=Richard|date=2001|title=Hidden from view: violent deaths among pregnant women in the District of Columbia, 1988-1996|journal=[[Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health]]|volume=46|pages=4–10|doi=10.1016/s1526-9523(00)00096-9|pmid=11300307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Homicide a leading cause of death in pregnant women. (ContinuingEducation)  http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Homicide+a+leading+cause+of+death+in+pregnant+women.+%28Continuing...-a080055987&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] study reported that "the overall pregnancy-associated homicide ratio was 1.7 deaths per 100 000 live births", and that homicide was not the leading cause of pregnancy-associated death, though it was still highlighted as among the leading causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Berg|first2=C. J.|last3=Saltzman|first3=L. E.|last4=Herndon|first4=J.|year=2005|title=Homicide: a leading cause of injury deaths among pregnant and postpartum women in the United States, 1991–1999|journal=Am J Public Health|volume=95|issue=|pages=471–477|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2005.072017|pmc=1449445|pmid=16195505|last1=Chang|first1=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Horon and Cheng argued that the CDC's study underestimated the problem because it used incomplete information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Using more sources of information, Horon and Cheng found that the rate of pregnancy-associated homicide in Maryland was 10.5 per 100,000 live births. They suggested a need for US states to improve their collection of data on pregnancy-associated deaths.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horon|first=Isabelle|last2=Cheng|first2=Diana|date=2005|title=Underreporting of pregnancy-associated deaths|journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]]|volume=95|pages=1879|doi=10.2105/ajph.2005.072017|pmid=16195505|pmc=1449445}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Washington Post'' reported in 2004 that "13 states said they had no way of telling how many pregnant and postpartum women had been killed in recent years".&lt;ref name="Wash Post" /&gt; In 2003, California remedied this by changing its [[death certificate]] documentation to include a female victim's maternity status.&lt;ref name="Wash Post" /&gt;

Homicide was the second-leading cause of death among women ages 20 to 24 and fifth among women ages 25–34 in 1999. The top cause of death in both age groups is accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kim|last=Curtis|url=http://www.now.org/issues/violence/043003pregnant.html|title=Murder: The Leading Cause of Death for Pregnant Women|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=April 23, 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120233913/http://www.now.org/issues/violence/043003pregnant.html|archivedate=November 20, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws and policies==
The [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act]], passed in 2004, defines a fetus as a "child in uterus" and a person as being a legal crime victim "if a fetal injury or death occurs during the commission of a federal violent crime."&lt;ref&gt;Ghazaleh, S., Martin, S. L., and Schiro, S. (2010) Homicide Among Pregnant and Postpartum Women in the United States: A Review of the Literature. Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse. (11), 42-54.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., 38 states have laws with more harsh penalties if the victim is murdered while pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrlc.org/federal/unbornvictims/statehomicidelaws092302/|title=State Homicide Laws That Recognize Unborn Victims|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nrlc.org|publisher=National Right to Life Committee|access-date=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/fetal-homicide-state-laws.aspx|title=Fetal Homicide State Laws|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these laws defining the fetus as being a person, "for the purpose of criminal prosecution of the offender" (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2008). [[Murder of Laci Peterson|Laci Peterson]], murdered in 2002, is one of the more high-profile homicides.

Currently in the [[North Carolina Senate]], a bill called the SB 353 Unborn Victims of Violence Act is being considered for legislation that would create a separate criminal offense for the death of a fetus when the mother is murdered. The North Carolina Coalition Against Domestic Violence does not support this law for numerous reasons including failure to see violence against the mother as the cause of the fetal death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCCADV Position Statement: Fetal Murder Legislation|url=http://www.nccadv.org/pdf/2008/finalNCCADVSTATEMENTfetalmurder07.pdf|publisher=North Carolina Coalition Against Domestic Violence|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coalition does, however, support the position of the [[National Network to End Domestic Violence]] regarding the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Intervention==
While it is almost impossible to determine an exact intervention point to prevent pregnancy-associated homicides, some possible opportunities can be pinpointed. The medical community is one of those points. Women may feel safe speaking to their health care providers about the abuse, especially after discovering they are pregnant. Some medical office and hospital policies specify that doctors will examine the patient privately without allowing the partner access. In a 2001 editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Victoria Frye writes, "Homicide by intimate partners may offer a focal point for effective pregnancy-associated mortality prevention efforts because many of these women come into contact with the health care system before their deaths."&lt;ref&gt;Frye, V. (2001) Examining Homicide's Contribution to Pregnancy-Associated Deaths. Journal of American Medical Association. (11), 1510-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of Intimate Partner Homicide policy and research has identified several needs: System-wide training in healthcare on signs of domestic violence&lt;ref name="Campbell, JC 2007"/&gt; and system-wide screening for domestic violence by health care providers, as well as the knowledge of where to refer women to that need services when abuse is disclosed.&lt;ref name="Martin, SL 2007"/&gt;

==Motives==
Statistics for pregnancy as being a motivating factor in the murder of a pregnant woman are usually unavailable. Motives may vary, with a woman's pregnancy at the time of death sometimes being coincidental.

{{refimprove|section|date=January 2018}}
Although the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] officially adopted the [[Gregorian calendar]] in 1918, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] continued to use the Julian calendar. The New Year became a holiday which is celebrated by both calendars.

As in most countries which use the Gregorian calendar, [[New Year's Day]] in Russia is a [[public holiday]] celebrated on January 1. On that day, joyous entertainment, fireworks, elaborate and often large meals and other festivities are common. The holiday is interesting as it combines secular traditions of bringing in the New Year with the Christian Orthodox [[Christmastide]] customs, such as ''[[kolyada]]''.

The New Year by the Julian calendar is still informally observed, and the tradition of celebrating the coming of the New Year twice is widely enjoyed: January 1 (''New'' New Year) and January 14 (''Old'' New Year).

Usually not as festive as the ''New'' New Year, for many this is a [[nostalgia|nostalgic]] family holiday ending the New Year holiday cycle (which includes [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christmas on January 7) with traditional large meals, singing and celebratory drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ytfiles.com/2009/12/30/top-ten-traditions-no-winter-holiday-season-in-russia-goes-without/ | date=30 December 2009 | title=Top Ten Traditions No Winter Holiday Season in Russia Goes Without | publisher=YT Files | first=Yuliya_ | last=Talmazan | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119182920/http://www.ytfiles.com/2009/12/30/top-ten-traditions-no-winter-holiday-season-in-russia-goes-without/ | archivedate=19 January 2010 | accessdate=12 January 2018 | deadurl=yes | df= }}{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Serbia==
The Old New Year ({{lang-sr|Стара Нова година}}/''Stara Nova godina'') is commonly called the ''Serbian New Year'' (Српска Нова година/''Srpska Nova godina''),&lt;ref name="insight"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/what-is-serbian-new-year |title=What is ‘Serbian New Year’? |date=13 January 2014 |website=Balkan Insight |accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes the ''Orthodox New Year'' (Православна Нова година/''Pravoslavna Nova godina'') and rarely ''Julian New Year'' (Јулијанска Нова година/''Julijanska Nova godina'').

The [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], with traditional adherence in Serbia (including [[Kosovo]]), [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Croatia]], celebrates its feasts and holidays according to the Julian calendar.&lt;ref name="insight"/&gt;

A part of the population celebrates ''Serbian New Year'' in a similar way as the New Year on January 1. This time, usually one concert is organized in front of either City Hall or the National Parliament (in [[Belgrade]]), while [[fireworks]] are prepared by the Serbian Orthodox Church and fired from the [[Church of Saint Sava]], where people also gather. Other cities also organize such celebrations. Restaurants, clubs, cafes and hotels are usually fully booked and organize New Year's celebrations with food and live music.&lt;ref name="insight"/&gt;

A traditional folk name for this holiday as part of [[Twelve Days of Christmas]] is ''Little [[Christmas]]'' (Мали Божић/''Mali Božić''). Some families continue with the procedures of [[Serbian Christmas traditions]].

==In Macedonia==
The holiday in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] is known as ''Old New Year'' ({{lang-mk|Стара Нова година}}, ''Stara Nova godina'') or as ''Vasilica'' (Василица, "[[Basil of Caesarea|St. Basil]]" (Св. Василиј, ''Sv. Vasilij'')). Late on January 14, people gather outside their houses, in the center of their neighborhoods where they start a huge bonfire, and drink and eat together. Traditional Macedonian music is sung. For those who stay at home, it is tradition to eat home-made [[pita]] with a [[coin]] inside. Whoever finds the coin in his part is said to have luck during the year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prespanews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1803:2012-01-12-14-49-31&amp;catid=44:prespa&amp;Itemid=107/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] around the world also celebrate the holiday, especially in Australia, Canada and United States where the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]] has adherents.

==Other countries==
The tradition of the Old New Year has been kept in [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Armenia]], [[Belarus]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (mostly in [[Republika Srpska]]), [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Montenegro]], [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]] ([[Malanka]]), [[Wales]] (as Hen Galan) and Switzerland (as alter Silvester). In Scotland, the Old New Year has traditionally been held on 12 January. In the first half of the 20th century, large segments of the Scottish Gaelic community still observed the feast&lt;ref&gt;The Last Pibroch, Jaunty Jock and the Ayrshire Idylls by Neil Munro, stated in the glossary; http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2012/jan/09/gaelic-new-year-celebrations&lt;/ref&gt; and today, it is still marked in South Uist and Eriskay as Oidhche Challaig and as Oidhche Challainn in Glenfinnan. Also in Scotland, the coastal town of [[Burghead]] in Morayshire celebrates the eve of the Old New Year with "The Burning o' the Clavie". Old New Year is the 12th of January in this district as well.

The [[Berber people|Berbers]] of [[Maghreb|North Africa]] (from [[Morocco]] to [[Libya]]) traditionally celebrate the [[Berber calendar#Yennayer|New Year on the "Berber calendar"]], which is very close to the Julian calendar. Because of certain calendar errors, the "Berber New Year" is celebrated in some areas on the 12th, rather than 14th, of January.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.depechedekabylie.com/index.php?news=15053 Yannayer, le 12 ou le 14 janvier?], LA DÉPÊCHE DE KABYLIE,  2006-01-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
The Old New Year tradition has received mention in Russian art; the [[playwright]] Mikhail Roshchin wrote a comedy drama called ''The Old New Year'' in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/orthodox-new-year-2015-how-christian-communities-around-world-celebrate-old-new-year-1483061 |title=Orthodox New Year 2015: How Christian communities around the world celebrate 'Old New Year' |last=Smith |first=Lydia |date=13 January 2015 |work=International Business Times |accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was staged for many years. He also made it into a screenplay for a 1980 television film which featured music by [[Sergey Nikitin (musician)|Sergey Nikitin]] and poetry lyrics by [[Boris Pasternak]]. The film was released by [[Mosfilm]] studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wildtipsy.com/en/pages/1386253 |title=Old New Year - An untranslatable play on words, and favorite film festival |website=Wild Tips |date=23 August 2016 |accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History'''

Charles Mowers, a German-born engineer and inventor, came from Texas to the Ozark Mountains around 1900 to hunt wild game. He bought the land known as the Big Rock Candy Mountain in 1928 and began construction of a “castle” based on his memories of buildings along the Rhine River. Using stone quarried on the property, he incorporated an unusual building method he called Egyptian Rock Work.

After the stock market crash of 1929, Mowers abandoned his castle and returned to Texas. The castle was finished in 1932 by the Reverend Charles Scoville (1869–1938), a renowned preacher of the [http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=4778 Disciples of Christ], who planned to use it as a retreat from his evangelistic labors. He named the site “Inspiration Point.” After his death, his widow gave the property to Phillips University in Enid, Oklahoma, for a conference and retreat center. Ten years later, however, this project was abandoned, and Henry Hobart, formerly dean of fine arts at Phillips, joined with Gertrude Stockard, director of music at Eureka Springs High School, to organize a music camp, Inspiration Point Fine Arts Colony (IPFAC), which held its first session in the summer of 1950. Hobart and his wife financed extensive repairs to the buildings with loans and donations from Eureka Springs businesses. Some furnishings were obtained from government surplus stores. Practice pianos were donated by area churches and schools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6458">'''Paculla Annia''' was a [[Campania]]n priestess of [[Bacchus]]. She is known only through the Roman historian [[Livy]]'s account of the introduction, growth and spread of unofficial [[Bacchanalia]] festivals, which were ferociously [[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus|suppressed]] in 186 BC under threat of extreme penalty. Paculla Annia is said to have presided over the corruption of Bacchus's [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery cult]] and its holy ''[[orgia]]'', starting around 188.  Livy describes the Bacchanalia as hitherto reserved to women, a daylight ritual held on just three days of the year; Paculla Annia changed them to nocturnal rites, increased their frequency to five a month, opened them to all social classes and both sexes - starting with her own sons, Minius and Herennius Cerrinius -.and made wine-fueled violence and sexual promiscuity mandatory for all initiates. The cult was thought to function as a hidden state within the state, with particular appeal to those with ''leuitas animi'' (fickle or uneducated minds); the lower classes, plebeians, women, the young, morally weak, and "men most like women" were thought most susceptible but even men of the highest class were not immune.  A virtuous ex-initiate and prostitute, Hispala Faecenia, though fearing the vengeance of the cult, revealed all to a shocked [[Roman senate]]. Once their investigation was complete, they suppressed the cult, saving Rome from the divine wrath and disaster it would otherwise have suffered. Livy claims that six thousand were executed, and that the arrests included Paculla's son, Minius Cerrineus. The legislation against the cult, or rather its forced reformation, is given in the [[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus]].&lt;ref&gt;Erich S. Gruen, "The Bacchanalia affair", in ''Studies in Greek Culture and Roman Policy'', University of California Press, 1996, p. 34 ff.[https://books.google.com/books?id=DNm4WKaQd6gC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false52.]&lt;/ref&gt; Paculla's fate is unknown.

Most modern scholarship agrees that Dionysiac or Bacchic mystery cults had been practiced in Roman Italy for several decades before 186, and were considered acceptable by Roman authorities until this abrupt "discovery" and rapid suppression.&lt;ref&gt;Livy describes their introduction by a foreign soothsayer, a "Greek of mean condition... a low operator of sacrifices" and their secretive spread, "like a plague", towards Rome via Etruria; see Sarolta Takacs, ''Vestal Virgins, Sibyls, and Matrons: Women in Roman Religion'',  University of Texas Press,  2008, p.95. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SnUCcOvhVKwC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=Takacs+Livy+%22men+most+like+women%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4mmdHBIx7E&amp;sig=kqi3LXcGK0mYk4qC2PTwJ3asqas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l_TOUOjfFoaM0AWDu4HwDg&amp;sqi=2&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Takacs%20Livy%20%22men%20most%20like%20women%22&amp;f=false] See also Beard, M.,  Price, S.,  North, J.,  ''Religions of Rome: Volume 1, a History'', illustrated, Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp. 93 - 96, and Walsh, PG, ''Making a drama out of a Crisis: Livy on the Bacchanalia'', Greece &amp; Rome, Vol XLIII,  No. 2, October 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Paculla Annia is unlikely to have introduced all the changes attributed to her by Livy;&lt;ref&gt;Erich S. Gruen, ''Studies in Greek Culture and Roman Policy'', University of California Press, 1996, pp 48 - 54.&lt;/ref&gt; many of his ''[[dramatis personae]]'', stylistic flourishes and tropes may draw more on Roman [[satyr play]]s than on the Bacchanalia themselves.&lt;ref&gt;The plots of Greek-based Satyr plays would have been familiar to Roman audiences from around the 3rd century BC on. See Robert Rouselle, Liber-Dionysus in Early Roman Drama, ''The Classical Journal'', 82, 3 (1987), p. 191.[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3297899]&lt;/ref&gt; Hispala Faecina provides the dramatic trope of "golden-hearted prostitute", whose courageous testimony, goodness, and loyalty far outweigh her low origin, profession and fear of reprisal.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Emma Pagán, ''Conspiracy Narratives in Roman History'', University of Texas Press, 2004, pp. 61 - 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Fontaine, assuming  [[Plautus]]'s ''[[Truculentus]]'' as contemporary with or no earlier than the events of 186, speculates its plot, themes and central character, the greedy, scheming, "evil courtesan" Phrynesium, arch-manipulator of men, as a "thinly veiled and politically conservative allegory" of Paculla Annia and her involvement with the Bacchanalia, particularly her illicit introduction of men into the cult, and its challenge to an established order and rule.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Fontaine, ''Funny Words in Plautine Comedy'', Oxford University Press, 2010, pp. 187 - 190.  The character Phrynesium is based on [[Phryne]], a Greek courtesan charged - much as Livy charges Paculla Annia - with the impious introduction of a mystery cult in which men and women were promiscuously mixed. In Fontaine's opinion, ''Truculentus'' aims to please a knowing and educated audience of Roman aristocrats.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus'' has been interpreted as an assertion of Rome's civil and religious authority, either throughout the Italian peninsula or within [[Ager Romanus|Roman territories]], following the recent [[Second Punic War|Punic War]] and subsequent social and political instability.&lt;ref&gt;During the Punic crisis, some foreign cults and oracles had been repressed, on much smaller scale and not outside Rome itself. See Erich S. Gruen, ''Studies in Greek culture and Roman policy'', BRILL, 1990, pp.34-78: on precedents see p.41 ff.[https://books.google.com/books?id=dnOPjX6GOrgC&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;ots=cvlbAQq3cx&amp;dq=Gruen%201990%20Bacchus&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Illicit Bacchanals persisted covertly for many years, particularly in Southern Italy, their likely place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;See Sarolta A. Takács, Politics and Religion in the Bacchanalian Affair of 186 B.C.E., ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology,'' Vol. 100, (2000), p.301.

The '''Pella Opera House''' is a historic building located in [[Pella, Iowa]], United States. Herman Rietveld, a local businessman and promoter, was the main backer for building the opera house, which was underwritten by the Pella Opera House Association. A previous opera house had been destroyed in a fire in the late 19th century. Pella architect Henry DeGooyer designed the four story, brick [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] structure. He used the opera house in [[Sioux City, Iowa]], as his guide. The locally produced orange-colored bricks are said to be distinctive to Pella.&lt;ref name=Page&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=91001080}}|title=Pella Opera House|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=1 August 2016|author=William C. Page}} with {{NRHP url|id=91001080|photos=y|title=photos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera house opened in November 1900 and regularly served its intended purpose for only a few years. After that it sporadically hosted stage performances until 1918. The building was converted into a commercial building at that time. It continued to serve that purpose until the 1980s when the Pella Opera House Commission acquired the property and converted back into a live entertainment venue. A [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]] architect, Lawrence M. Erickson, was architect for the rehabilitation project, completed in 1990. The building was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1992.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;

[[File:Perth Mint.jpg|thumb|right|Perth Mint]]
The '''Perth Mint Swindle''' is the popular name for the [[robbery]] of 49 [[gold]] bars weighing 68&amp;nbsp;kg from the [[Perth Mint]] in [[Western Australia]] on 22 June, 1982. The bullion was valued at A$653,000 at that time (2011:$2.02 million). {{As of|2018|1|8}}, the value of the 68 kilograms of gold would approach AUD $3.7 Million.

According to police at the time, three brothers, Ray, Peter and Brian Mickelberg, orchestrated the robbery.  The three went to trial and were found guilty of the conspiracy and sentenced in 1983 to twenty, sixteen and twelve years in [[Prison|jail]] respectively.

All three convictions were overturned in 2004.  To date the case remains unsolved and continues to be fought by the Mickelbergs who maintain their innocence and allege a conspiracy by the [[Western Australia Police]] to frame them.

==Mickelberg brothers==
Soon after the robbery police investigations focused on the Mickelberg brothers.  According to the police, the brothers stole cheques from a Perth building society and then fooled the mint into accepting those cheques in exchange for gold bullion which, it was alleged, the brothers had a courier pick up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/35.html|work=High Court of Australia Appeal|title=MICKELBERG v. THE QUEEN [1989] HCA 35, opinion of Deane, J., Para 33|accessdate=2015-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gold was picked up by a security company who delivered it to an office in Perth and then to [[Jandakot Airport]], from where it seemingly disappeared.

In a separate matter, in September 1982, the three brothers, their parents and another man Brian Pozzi were charged over a matter relating to a manufactured gold nugget known as the "Yellow Rose of Texas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2004/s1148111.htm|work=ABC 7:30 Report|title=Mickelbergs sue policeman|accessdate=2009-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perth Businessman [[Alan Bond (businessman)|Alan Bond]] had purchased the nugget for $350,000 in November 1980.  It was later found to be worth less than $150,000 and Raymond Mickelberg and Brian Pozzi pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to fraud at their June 1984 trial.

After serving nine months of his jail term and having his conviction overturned on appeal, Brian was released from jail but died in a light aircraft crash on 27 February 1986, when the twin-engined [[Aero Commander]] he was flying ran out of fuel near [[Canning Dam]] on the outskirts of Perth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Sydney Morning Herald|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=s2MUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KOgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4990,8172242&amp;dq=brian+mickelberg+crash&amp;hl=en|title=Mickelberg Dies|date=28 February 1986|accessdate=2009-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whilst in prison, Ray and Peter embarked on a series of seven appeals against their convictions, essentially on the grounds that their confessions had been fabricated by police investigators.  Ray and Peter served eight and six years of their sentences respectively before being released on [[parole]].

In 1989, 55&amp;nbsp;kg of gold pellets, said to have been from the swindle, were found outside the gates of [[TVW-7]] (currently Channel Seven Perth), a Perth television station, with an anonymous note addressed to one of the station's reporters—Alison Fan—protesting the Mickelberg's innocence and claiming that a prominent Perth businessman was behind the swindle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Mint robbers were framed |author= Liza Kappelle |date= 11 June 2002 |publisher= [[Sydney Morning Herald]] |url= http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/06/10/1022982819650.html| accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police  officers==
===Don Hancock===
The senior investigating officer in the case was Detective-Sergeant [[Don Hancock]] who was later promoted to head of the State Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB).  Hancock and a friend, Lou Lewis, died in a [[car bomb|bomb]] explosion outside Hancock's home in [[Lathlain, Western Australia|Lathlain]] in September 2001. Hancock was murdered by [[Gypsy Joker Motorcycle Club|Gypsy Joker]] Sid Reid in revenge for the murder of Billy Grierson, allegedly by Hancock after Grierson "made obscene comments in front of his daughter." A subsequent (2003) prosecution of an alleged accomplice was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;{{cite news | last = Marks | first = Kathy | date = 30 October 2013 | title = Biker gang chief cleared in police murder case | work = [[The Independent]] | location =  | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/biker-gang-chief-cleared-in-police-murder-case-93699.html | accessdate = 10 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2006 inquest into the October 2000 shooting death Billy Grierson, the coroner stated: "There is a significant body of evidence which suggests Mr Hancock may have been the shooter," but the Gypsy Jokers "could have a large number of enemies." he was unable to determine who Grierson's killer was because Hancock was now dead, police had failed to conduct routine forensic science tests and had failed to search Hancock's home. The relevant senior investigating officer was Kim Gage, head of Kalgoorlie detectives, who had reportedly spent the day drinking with Hancock and others.&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt;  Reid was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in jail&lt;ref name="smh2"&gt;{{cite news | last =  | first =  | date = 21 April 2006 | title = Gypsy Joker sniper shooting mystery | work = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | location =  | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/gypsy-joker-sniper-shooting-mystery/2006/04/21/1145344267201.html | accessdate = 10 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was reduced to 15 years for helping police in the failed second prosecution.&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt;

===Tony Lewandowski===
In 2002, midway through a State [[Royal commission into whether there has been corrupt or criminal conduct by any Western Australian Police Officer|Royal Commission]] into police corruption, a retired police officer who had been at the centre of the case, [[Tony Lewandowski]], made a confession of his involvement in fabricating evidence which was used to help frame the brothers.  Lewandowski's senior officer during the investigation was Don Hancock. The two were the only persons present at the brothers' interviews following the Mickelberg arrests.&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(On that day), Don Hancock came into the room and told me to make Peter strip naked. Don then went up to Peter and gave him two or three quick punches in the solar plexus. The statements purportedly taken from Peter Mickelberg on July 26, 1982, were in fact not taken in Peter's presence that day, but were a fabrication made by Don Hancock and myself shortly after September 2, 1982. I gave evidence at the trial and numerous appeals. All that evidence in relation to the so-called confessions was false." &amp;mdash;Statement of Tony Lewandowski&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lewandowski was subsequently charged with attempting to [[Perverting the course of justice|pervert the course of justice]], [[making false statements]], fabricating [[evidence]] and [[perjury]].&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;{{cite news|work=Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/10/03/1033538678821.html?oneclick=true|title=Mint swindle officer seized|accessdate=2005-09-07 | date=3 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2004, just before facing trial Lewandowski apparently committed [[suicide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2007/s2141883.htm|title=Mickelberg brothers find unlikely ally|work=ABC 7:30 Report|date=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; though there has been some speculation as to whether or not this may have been staged to cover his (possible) murder.  Although now deceased, through Lewandowski's confession, Hancock was directly implicated in fabricating evidence in the Mickelberg case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=MelbourneCrime|url=http://www.melbournecrime.bizhosting.com/bhancock.htm|title=Don Hancock and the Perth Mint Swindle|accessdate=2005-09-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050903031437/http://www.melbournecrime.bizhosting.com/bhancock.htm |archivedate = 2005-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convictions quashed==
In July 2004 the Western Australian Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the brothers' convictions after seven unsuccessful attempts. The judge ruled that with the suppression of their sentence, they were entitled to a presumption of innocence.  The Assistant Police Commissioner, [[Mel Hay]], expressed disappointment with the decision which prompted a threat of a [[defamation]] [[lawsuit]] from the brothers.  The brothers subsequently sued the Western Australian government for libel, and as part of the settlement, the West Australian police issued a public apology in December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=337171&amp;rss=yes |title= Police apologise to Mickelberg brothers |date= 15 December 2008 |work= www.ninemsn.com.au |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071216052659/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=337171&amp;rss=yes |archivedate= 16 December 2007 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After lodging claims for compensation, in January 2008 State Attorney-General [[Jim McGinty]] offered $500,000 in ex-gratia payments to each brother for the "injustice done to them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=77&amp;ContentID=54634 |title=Mickelberg payment satisfies neither brothers nor police |work=thewest.com.au |date=16 January 2008 |accessdate=2009-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318212707/http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=77&amp;ContentID=54634 |archivedate=18 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The payment followed $658,672 paid to cover legal costs of their two appeals.

==Books about the case==
Author [[Avon Lovell]] wrote a book about the case in 1985: ''[[The Mickelberg Stitch]]'', which alleged questionable investigation practices by the police, including production of unsigned confessions and a forged [[fingerprint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Post Newspapers|url=http://www.postnewspapers.com.au/20020615/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020816062848/http://www.postnewspapers.com.au/20020615/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 August 2002|title=This time, the stitch is by Lovell|accessdate=2005-09-07|df=dmy-all}} &lt;/ref&gt; The police union collected a levy of $1 per week from each member to fund legal action against Lovell and his publishers and distributors to suppress publication of the book.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}  It was estimated that between one and two million dollars was raised.  The book was banned by the State Government, but was still freely available to be read at the [[J S Battye Library]]. The ban was eventually lifted.

A second book by Lovell, ''Split Image'', was published in 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Lovell, Avon | title=Split image : international mystery of the Mickelberg affair | publication-date=1990 | publisher=Creative Research | isbn=978-0-908469-24-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and met a similar fate to the first.  This ban was also lifted later.

In March 2011, Lovell launched a third book on the case, ''Litany of Lies'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Lovell, Avon | title=Litany of lies : a true story of gold heists, bombings, feral cops, greed, murder &amp; revenge | publication-date=2010 | publisher=bookscope.com.au | isbn=978-0-9808715-0-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See the blog overview of the book launch - http://blog.elizabethsbookshop.com.au/?p=311&lt;/ref&gt; at about the same time that [[Tony Buti|Antonio Buti]] wrote on the subject&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Buti, Antonio | title=Brothers : justice, corruption and the Mickelbergs | publication-date=2011 | publisher=Fremantle Press | isbn=978-1-921888-47-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Sheehan, Kate | title=Buti, Antonio.

The '''pinewood derby''' is a racing event for unpowered, unmanned miniature cars. Pinewood derbies are often run by chapters (packs) of the [[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouts]] program of [[Boy Scouts of America]]. With the help of adults, Scouts build their own cars from wood, usually from kits containing a block of [[pine]] wood, plastic [[wheel]]s, and metal [[axle]]s. With the popularity of the pinewood derby, other organizations have developed similar events, and a small industry has developed to provide organizer equipment (e.g. [[race track|tracks]], [[timer]]s, and [[weighing scale|scales]]) and awards (e.g. [[trophy|trophies]] and [[ribbon (award)|ribbons]]). Similar Cub Scouting events include the [[raingutter regatta]] (a race for miniature boats) and the [[space derby]] (a race for rubber band-driven propeller shuttles).

==Origins==
{{refimprove|section|date=May 2018}}
[[File:Western Los Angeles County Council Pinewood Derby CSP.png|thumb|2003 patch honoring Don Murphy and celebrating the 50th anniversary of the derby]]
The first pinewood derby was held on May 15, 1953 at the Scout House in [[Manhattan Beach, California]] by Cub Scout Pack 280C (the present Pack 713&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pack713.org |title=Cub Scout Pack 713 &amp;#124; Manhattan Beach, CA |publisher=Pack713.org |accessdate=December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The concept was created by the Pack's Cubmaster Don Murphy, and sponsored by the Management Club at [[North American Aviation]].&lt;ref name="BSA Museum"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bsamuseum.org/exhibits/derby/index.html |work= National Scouting Museum |title= The Pinewood Derby |accessdate= February 29, 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080204081656/http://www.bsamuseum.org/exhibits/derby/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate= February 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy's son was too young to participate in the popular [[Soap Box Derby]] races, so he came up with the idea of racing miniature wood cars. The cars had the same gravity-powered concept as the full-size Soap Box Derby cars, but were much smaller and easier to build.

The pinewood derby had a sensational first year. Murphy and the Management Club of North American Aviation sent out thousands of brochures to anyone who requested more information. The idea spread rapidly, and competitions were held across the country, mainly with recreation departments and nonprofit organizations including the Los Angeles County Department of Recreation. Of all that early enthusiasm, however, only the Boy Scouts of America made it part of an official program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pinewoodpro.com/pinewood-derby-history.php |title= The History of Pinewood Derby Car Racing |work= Pinewood Pro |accessdate= February 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= John |last= Bogert |title= Scouts Honor&amp;nbsp;— Memorial Set for Creator of the Pinewood Derby |date= July 9, 2008 |work= Daily Breeze |publisher= Los Angeles Newspaper group |url= http://www.dailybreeze.com/ci_9834624 |accessdate= July 11, 2008 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081005203230/http://www.dailybreeze.com/ci_9834624 |archivedate= October 5, 2008 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Director of Cub Scouting Service, O. W. (Bud) Bennett, wrote Murphy: "We believe you have an excellent idea, and we are most anxious to make your material available to the Cub Scouts of America." Within the year, the Boy Scouts of America adopted the pinewood derby for use in all Cub Scout packs.

In its October 1954 issue, ''[[Boys' Life]]'' publicized the event and offered plans for the track and a car, which featured "four wheels, four nails, and three blocks of wood."

Murphy continued to run the derby program through the Management Club until his retirement from North American Aviation in 1978. He died in 2008.

In 2003, Pack 713 celebrated the 50th Pinewood Derby along with Packs 287, 759, 275, and former Cub Scouts from the 1953 Pack 280c. A shoulder patch for the [[Western Los Angeles County Council]] that depicted a pinewood derby car and a message of honor to Murphy was released to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the event.

In 1980, the design of the block was changed from a cutout block, consistent with a 1940s style front-engined [[Indy 500]] car, to a rectangular block. The tires were also changed from narrow, hard plastic, to wider "slicks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.maximum-velocity.com/pinewood-derby-times-v7i13/ |title=Pinewood Derby Times Newsletter Volume 7 Issue 13 |publisher=Maximum-velocity.com |date=March 5, 2008 |accessdate=December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, the Boy Scouts of America registered Pinewood Derby as an official trademark.&lt;ref name=uspto/&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Pinewood.jpg|thumb|Official car kit]]
When using a kit sold through Boy Scouts of America (BSA), the Scout begins a block of wood, four [[plastic]] wheels, and four [[nail (fastener)|nails]] for axels. The finished car must use all nine pieces, must not exceed a certain weight (usually five ounces (150 grams)),&lt;ref name="bsa_buildit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pinewoodderby.org/#/one/buildit |title=Pinewood Derby |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; must not exceed a certain width (usually 2-3/4 inches (7&amp;nbsp;cm))&lt;ref name="bsa_buildit"/&gt; and length (usually 7 inches (17.8&amp;nbsp;cm))&lt;ref name="bsa_buildit"/&gt; and must fit on the track used by that particular Scout pack.

Blocks can be [[whittling|whittled]] with a hand knife, [[bandsaw]], or [[Dremel]] carving tool for major shaping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dremelderby.com/ |title=Dremel Pinewood Derby Days |publisher=Dremelderby.com |accessdate=December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Decal]]s can be bought at Scout shops or hobby shops. It is also possible to use standard model decals to replicate actual racing cars such as [[Richard Petty]]'s 1970 [[Plymouth Superbird]]. The original style is based on open-wheel cars; however, fender or body kits are available, or wheels can simply be placed outboard of the body.

Other than the previous basic design rules, the Cub Scout is able to carve and decorate the car as he chooses. Cars vary from unfinished blocks to whimsical objects, to accurate replicas of actual cars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agent86favorites.com/Pages/Pinewood_Derby_000.htm Pinewood Derby Car Construction]{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To improve racing performance, many Cub Scouts add weights (e.g. coins or other bits of metal) to the final design to bring the car to the maximum allowable weight. Axel friction can be reduced by polishing the nails, but graphite is usually the only lubricant allowed.

The Cub Scout organization intends that Scouts build their own pinewood derby cars and that parents have a secondary construction role. However, it is often the case that the parent takes over the construction of the car, an aspect of the event that was lampooned in the 2005 film ''[[Down and Derby]]'', and also in a [[Pinewood Derby (South Park)|2009 episode]] of ''[[South Park]]''. The quest for a fast car supports a cottage industry that supplies modified wheels, axles, and blocks as well as videos and instruction books. While a pinewood derby car kit costs around US$4, a set of modified wheels and axles can sell for more than ten times that amount. Each pack sets its own rules under the guidelines set forth by the BSA&lt;ref name="BSA Rules"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scouting.org/Training/Adult/Supplemental/pinewood.aspx |title= Cub Scout Pinewood Derby Pamphlet|work=33721A |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their particular local district. The [[aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] items are legal under some Pack rules since the parts originally came from an official BSA kit. Complete cars can be purchased on [[eBay]] and elsewhere for around $100 to $200, and PineCar, a subsidiary of [[Woodland Scenics]], sells pre-cut or pre-made cars, as well as official kits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.maximum-velocity.com/pinewood-derby-times-v5i3/ |title= The Dark Side: eBay Cars |work= Pinewood Derby Times |accessdate= March 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these cars violate the spirit of the event, if not the rules, enforcement can be difficult.

Model manufacturer [[Revell]] was licensed by the BSA to produce pinewood derby kits with a release in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Revell Pinewood Derby |url= http://www.revell.com/pinewood-derby/index.html |accessdate= December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition==
[[File:PinewoodFinish.jpg|thumb|right|Finish of a Pinewood Derby heat.]]
The track usually has two to eight lanes and slopes down to the ground, since the cars are powered by [[gravity]]. Tracks may be owned by the pack or rented. The race is run in heats, giving every car the chance to run on each lane. The racers can be grouped with others from the same rank (Tiger Cubs, Wolf Cubs, Bear Cubs, etc.), or can compete against the pack as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Tips to get you started building a Pinewood Derby car track |publisher= ABC Pinewood Car |url= http://www.abc-pinewood-derby.com/pinewood-derby-track.php |accessdate= February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Track Pinewood Derby.jpg|thumb|upright|Car track]]
First, second, and third-place winners usually receive ribbons, medals, or [[trophy|trophies]]. Some packs also award on the basis of car design or styling. The first place race winners get to advance to the district level, then each of the district-wide race winners get to race each other from across the entire council.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Other races==
{{Main article|Wood car racing}}
[[File:Pinewood cars 2004.jpg|thumb|Pinewood derby cars ready to race]]
As the popularity of the pinewood derby grew, other organizations adopted the concept. Pinewood derby is a registered trademark of the BSA,&lt;ref name=uspto&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=76447146 |title= Search of Trademark Application and Registration Retrieval system |publisher= U.S. Patent and Trademark Office |accessdate= March 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; so most use different names. Each derby has slightly different rules for making and racing their cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shapenrace.net/#!race-rules/c1v94 |title= Pinewood Rules and More |work= ShapeNRace |accessdate= November 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Car modifications==
[[File:One gram compare.jpg|thumb|Stock wheels (left) and modified (one gram) wheels (right)]]
The force accelerating a pinewood derby car is [[gravity]]; the opposing forces are [[friction]] and [[air drag]]. Therefore, car modifications are aimed at maximizing the [[potential energy]] in the car design and minimizing the air drag and the friction that occurs when the wheel spins on the axle, contacts the axle head or car body, or contacts the track guide rail.&lt;ref name=cowley&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cowley |first= E. Roger |title= Pinewood Derby Physics |journal= The Physics Teacher |volume= 27 |issue= 8 |pages= 610–612 |publisher= American Association of Physics Teachers |date=November 1989 |doi= 10.1119/1.2342889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friction due to air drag is a minor, although not insignificant, factor. The wheel [[tread]] can be sanded or turned on a lathe and the inner surface of the hub can be tapered to minimize the contact area between the hub and body. Polishing the wheel, especially the inner hub, with a plastic polish can also reduce friction. Often one front wheel is raised slightly so that it does not contact the track and add to the [[rolling resistance]]. Axles are filed or turned on a lathe to remove the burr and crimp marks and polished smooth. More extensive modifications involve tapering the axle head and cutting a notch to minimize the wheel-to-axle contact area. Packs can establish additional rules for what, if any, modifications are allowed. In some areas, no changes can be made to the axles or wheels.&lt;ref name=cowley/&gt;

A second consideration is the [[rotational energy]] stored in the wheels. The pinewood derby car converts gravitational [[potential energy]] into translational [[kinetic energy]] (speed) plus rotational energy. Heavier wheels have a greater [[moment of inertia]] and their spinning takes away energy that would otherwise contribute to the speed of the car. A standard wheel has a mass of 2.6 g, but this can be reduced to as little as 1 g by removing material from the inside of the wheel. A raised wheel can reduce the rotational energy up to one-quarter, but this advantage is less with a bumpy track.&lt;ref name=cowley/&gt;

Another consideration is the track itself. A track that is mostly sloping, with little flat at the end, can allow cars with minimal mass in their wheels to shine. However, a track with a steep slope and then a long flat section can penalize such cars due to the quick loss of energy they experience once they have reached the bottom, when all potential energy has been transferred to kinetic and rotational energy. Such cars will take a lead on the downslope, but may be passed by cars with more energy "stored" away as rotational energy on the flat.&lt;ref name=cowley/&gt;

A proper lubricant, typically [[graphite]] powder, is essential. [[Wheel alignment]] is important both to minimize wheel contact with the axle head and body as well as to limit the contact between the wheels and guide rail as the car travels down the track. There are 32 friction causing surfaces on a pinewood derby car. These include the surfaces of all four wheels which touch either the axle, the body or the track and the surfaces of all four axles which touch the wheel. Neglecting to polish and lubricate any of these 32 surfaces will result in degraded performance. The [[center of mass]] of a typical car is low and slightly ahead of the rear axle, which helps the car track straight as well as providing a slight advantage due to the additional gravitational potential energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.maximum-velocity.com/free-speed-tips/ |title= Five Keys to Pine Derby Performance |work= Maximum Velocity |accessdate= September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:pine car winner.jpg|thumb|upright|A Cub Scout holds a winning pine car]]
The pinewood derby was selected as part of "America's 100 Best" in 2006 as "a celebrated rite of spring" by ''[[Reader's Digest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= 2006 |url= http://www.rd.com/cub-scouts-pinewood-derby-race/article.html |title= Best Mother-Son Finish |work= Reader's Digest |accessdate= February 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event has also been parodied by ''South Park'' in the episode "[[Pinewood Derby (South Park)|Pinewood Derby]]" and in the film ''[[Down and Derby]]''.&lt;ref name="BSA Museum"/&gt;

The '''Rimini Proclamation''' was a proclamation on 30 March 1815 by [[Joachim Murat]], who had been made king of Naples by [[Napoleon I]]. Murat had just [[Neapolitan War|declared war on Austria]] and used the proclamation to call on Italians to revolt against their Austrian occupiers and to show himself as a backer of Italian independence, in an attempt to find allies in his desperate battle to hang onto his throne. It began:
{{Cquote|Italians! The hour has come to engage in your highest destiny.}}

The proclamation impressed [[Alessandro Manzoni]], who wrote a poem later that year entitled ''Il proclama di Rimini'', but he left it unfinished after Murat's military campaign failed.

The '''Roman Question''' ({{lang-it|Questione romana}}; {{lang-la|Quaestio Romana}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ABNPAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22quaestio+romana%22&amp;dq=%22quaestio+romana%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3_Zy__pnZAhVlkeAKHVETDWEQ6AEILDAA|title=Washington University Studies: New series, Language and literature|author=Brendel, Otto|date=1942|publisher=Washington University|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a dispute regarding the temporal power of the [[pope]]s as rulers of a civil territory in the context of the Italian [[Risorgimento]]. It ended with the [[Lateran treaties|Lateran Pacts]] between King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] and [[Pope Pius XI]] in 1929.

== International interest ==

On 9 February 1849, the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] took over the government of the [[Papal States]]. In the following July, an intervention by French troops restored [[Pope Pius IX]] to power, making the Roman Question a hotly debated one even in the internal politics of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pyat|first1=Félix|title=Question romaine: affaire du 13 juin: lettre aux électeurs de la Seine, de la Nièvre et du Cher|date=1849|publisher=Société éditrice l'Union|location=Lausanne| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVU7AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22question+romaine%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eIvpVLW5LdKM7Abd8YDABg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22question%20romaine%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1859, after France and Austria made an agreement that ended the short [[Second Italian War of Independence]], an article headed "The Roman Question" in the ''[[Westminster Review]]'' expressed the opinion that the Papal States should be deprived of the Adriatic provinces and be restricted to the territory around Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JgwiAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA120&amp;dq=%22Roman+Question%22+%22Westminster+Review%22+diminution&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5sfpVI3-JvSp7Aay_oGwDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Roman%20Question%22%20%22Westminster%20Review%22%20diminution&amp;f=false "The Roman Question" in ''The Westminster Review'', No. CXLI, July 1859, pp. 120–121]&lt;/ref&gt; This became a reality in the following year, when most of the Papal States were annexed by what became the [[Kingdom of Italy]].

==Claims of the Kingdom of Italy==
{{Main article|Italian unification|Capture of Rome}}
[[File:Italy unification 1815 1870.jpg|thumb|right|Italian unification process.]]
On February 18, 1861, the deputies of the first [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliament]] assembled in [[Turin]]. On March 17, 1861, the Parliament proclaimed [[Victor Emmanuel II]] King of Italy, and on March 27, 1861, Rome was declared Capital of the Kingdom of Italy. However, the Italian Government could not take its seat in Rome because a French garrison (which had overthrown the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]]), maintained there by [[Napoleon&amp;nbsp;III of France]], commanded by general [[Christophe Léon Louis Juchault de Lamoricière]], was defending Pope Pius&amp;nbsp;IX. Following the signing of the [[September Convention]], the seat of government was moved from Turin to Florence in 1865.

The Pope remained totally opposed to the designs on Rome of [[Italian nationalism]]. Beginning in December 1869, the [[First Vatican Council]] was held in the city. Some historians have argued that its proclamation of the doctrine of [[papal infallibility]] in July 1870 had political as well as theological causes.

In July 1870, the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began. In early August, [[Napoleon III]] recalled his garrison from Rome and could no longer protect what remained of the Papal States. Widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian government take Rome. The Italian government took no direct action until the collapse of Napoleon at the [[battle of Sedan]]. King Victor Emmanuel&amp;nbsp;II then sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius&amp;nbsp;IX with a personal letter offering a proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of protecting the pope.

According to Raffaele De Cesare:
{{quote|The Pope's reception of San Martino [10 September 1870] was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King's letter upon the table he exclaimed, "Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith." He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. After, growing calmer, he exclaimed: "I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.&lt;ref&gt;De Cesare, 1909, p. 444.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Italian army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that an unopposed entry could be negotiated. The Italian army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Pius&amp;nbsp;IX decided that the surrender of the city would be granted only after his troops had put up a token resistance, enough to make it plain that the takeover was not freely accepted. On 20 September, after a cannonade of three hours had breached the Aurelian Walls at [[Porta Pia]], the [[Bersaglieri]] entered Rome (see [[capture of Rome]]). Forty-nine Italian soldiers and 19 [[Papal Zouaves]] died. Rome and the region of [[Lazio]] were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a plebiscite.

Again, according to Raffaele De Cesare:
{{quote|The Roman question was the stone tied to Napoleon's feet—that dragged him into the abyss. He never forgot, even in August 1870, a month before [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Sedan]], that he was a sovereign of a Catholic country, that he had been made emperor, and was supported by the votes of the conservatives and the influence of the clergy; and that it was his supreme duty not to abandon the pontiff.... For twenty years Napoleon&amp;nbsp;III had been the true sovereign of Rome, where he had many friends and relations.... Without him the [[temporal power (Papal)|temporal power]] would never have been reconstituted, nor, being reconstituted, would have endured."&lt;ref&gt;De Cesare, 1909, pp. 440–443.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Dilemma==
[[Pope Pius IX]] and succeeding popes [[Pope Leo XIII|Leo XIII]], [[Pope Pius X|Pius X]], [[Pope Benedict XV|Benedict XV]], and [[Pope Pius XI|Pius XI]] took great care not to recognize the legitimacy of the Italian government following the capture of Rome. Several options were considered, including giving the city a status similar to that of [[Moscow]] at the time{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} (which, despite being the capital of [[Russia]],{{citation needed|date=September 2015|reason=The Moscow article says that Moscow wasn't the capital at the time.}} was not the seat of government), but there was widespread agreement that Rome must be the capital to ensure the survival of the new state. However, [[Victor Emmanuel&amp;nbsp;II of Italy]] refused to take residence in the [[Quirinal Palace]], and foreign powers were likewise uneasy with the move. The British ambassador noted the apparent contradiction of a secular government sharing the city with a religious government, while the French foreign minister wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If [Italy] would consent to view Florence as the seat of government, it would solve the Papal question. It would show great sense, and the political credit it would thereby garner, as well as the honor, would offer a considerable advantage...Rome, under royal rule—an integral part of the Italian nation, but remaining Holy or, better yet, the Dominant center of the domain of the faith—would lose none of its prestige and would redound to Italy's credit. And conciliation would then come about naturally, because the pope would become accustomed to seeing himself as living in his own home, not having a king around.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the government refused such suggestions and the king eventually took up residence in the [[Quirinal Palace]]. Regarded by Roman citizens as the ultimate sign of authority in the city, the Quirinal had been built and used by previous popes. When asked for the keys, Pius IX reportedly said, "Whom do these thieves think they are kidding asking for the keys to open the door? Let them knock it down if they, like Bonaparte's soldiers, when they wanted to seize [[Pope Pius VI|Pius&amp;nbsp;VI]], came through the window, but even they did not have the effrontery to ask for the keys". A locksmith was later hired.&lt;ref&gt;Kertzer 2004, pp. 79–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law of Papal Guarantees==

[[Italy]]'s '''Law of Guarantees''', passed by the senate and chamber of the Italian parliament on 13 May 1871, accorded the [[Pope]] certain honors and privileges similar to those enjoyed by the [[King of Italy]], including the right to send and receive [[ambassador]]s who would have full [[diplomatic immunity]], just as if he still had [[Temporal power (Papal)|temporal power]] as ruler of a state. The law was intended to attempt to avoid further antagonizing the pope following unification and was roundly criticized by anti-clerical politicians of all alignments, but particularly on the left. At the same time, it subjected the papacy to a law that the Italian parliament could modify or abrogate at any time.

[[Pope Pius IX]] and his successors refused to recognize the right of the Italian king to reign over what had formerly been the Papal States, or the right of the Italian government to decide his prerogatives and make laws for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07048a.htm|title=Law of Guarantees|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asserting that the [[Holy See]] needed to maintain clearly manifested independence from any political power in its exercise of spiritual jurisdiction, and that the Pope should not appear to be merely a "chaplain of the [[King of Italy]]",&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, 2005, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Pius IX rejected the Law of Papal Guarantees with its offer of an annual financial payment to the Pope.

Despite the Italian state's repeated assurances of the Pope's absolute liberty of movement within Italy and abroad, the popes refused to set foot outside the walls of the Vatican and thereby put themselves under the protection of the Italian forces of law and order, an implicit recognition of the changed situation. Consequently, the description "[[prisoner of the Vatican|prisoners of the Vatican]]" was applied to them,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y_4eaFsFdI4C&amp;pg=PT155&amp;dq=Kertzer+%22papal+prisoner%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A1scUp2fBomp7Ab67IHYDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Kertzer%20%22papal%20prisoner%22&amp;f=false|title=Prisoner of the Vatican: The Popes, the Kings, and Garibaldi's Rebels in the Struggle to Rule Modern Italy|last=Kertzer|first=David I.|date=2006-02-20|publisher=HMH|isbn=9780547347165|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 settled the Roman Question by establishing [[Vatican City]] as an independent state.

During this time, Italian nobility who owed their titles to the Holy See rather than the Kingdom of Italy became known as the [[Black Nobility]] as they were considered to be in mourning.

==Plans to leave Rome==
Several times during his pontificate, Pius IX considered leaving Rome a second time.  He had fled Rome in disguise in November 1848, following the assassination of his Minister of Finance, Count [[Pellegrino Rossi]]. One occurrence was in 1862, when [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] was in Sicily gathering volunteers for a campaign to take Rome under the slogan ''Roma o Morte'' (Rome or Death). On 26 July 1862, before Garibaldi and his volunteers were stopped at [[Battle of Aspromonte|Aspromonte]],
{{quote|Pius IX confided his fears to [[Odo Russell, 1st Baron Ampthill|Lord Odo Russell]], the British Minister in Rome, and asked whether he would be granted political asylum in England after the Italian troops had marched in. Odo Russell assured him that he would be granted asylum if the need arose, but said that he was sure that the Pope's fears were unfounded.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper Ridley, ''Garibaldi'', Viking Press, New York (1976) p. 535&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another instance and rumours of others occurred after the [[Capture of Rome]] and the suspension of the [[First Vatican Council]]. These were confided by [[Otto von Bismarck]] to [[Julius Hermann Moritz Busch]]:
{{quote|As a matter of fact, [[Pope Pius IX|he]] has already asked whether we could grant him asylum. I have no objection to it—[[Cologne]] or [[Fulda]]. It would be passing strange, but after all not so inexplicable, and it would be very useful to us to be recognised by Catholics as what we really are, that is to say, the sole power now existing that is capable of protecting the head of their Church. [...] But the King [later to become [[Wilhelm&amp;nbsp;I, German Emperor]]] will not consent. He is terribly afraid. He thinks all Prussia would be perverted and he himself would be obliged to become a Catholic. I told him, however, that if the Pope begged for asylum he could not refuse it. He would have to grant it as ruler of ten million Catholic subjects who would desire to see the head of their Church protected.&lt;ref&gt;Moritz Busch, ''Bismarck: Some Secret Pages of His History'', Vol. I, Macmillan (1898) p. 220, entry for 8 November 1870&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Rumours have already been circulated on various occasions to the effect that the Pope intends to leave Rome. According to the latest of these the Council, which was adjourned in the summer, will be reopened at another place, some persons mentioning [[Malta]] and others [[Trento|Trient]]. [...] Doubtless the main object of this gathering will be to elicit from the assembled fathers a strong declaration in favour of the necessity of the [[Papal States|Temporal Power]]. Obviously a secondary object of this Parliament of Bishops, convoked away from Rome, would be to demonstrate to Europe that the Vatican does not enjoy the necessary liberty, although the Act of Guarantee proves that the Italian Government, in its desire for reconciliation and its readiness to meet the wishes of the Curia, has actually done everything that lies in its power.&lt;ref&gt;Moritz Busch, ''Bismarck: Some Secret Pages of His History'', Vol. II, Macmillan (1898) pp. 43–44, entry for 3 March 1872&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Lateran Treaty==
{{Main article|Lateran Treaty}}
The [[Lateran Treaty]] resolved the Roman Question in 1929; the Holy See acknowledged Italian sovereignty over the former Papal States and Italy recognized papal sovereignty over [[Vatican City]]. The Holy See limited its request for indemnity for the loss of the Papal States and of ecclesiastical property confiscated by the Italian State to much less than would have been due to it under the Law of Guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/treaty.htm|title=Text of the Lateran Treaty of 1929|website=www.aloha.net|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
Historical dramas such as ''[[Fabiola (novel)|Fabiola]]'' and ''[[Quo Vadis (novel)|Quo Vadis]]'' have been interpreted as comparing the treatment of the popes by the newly formed Kingdom of Italy to the [[persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, 2005, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12070">'''Shadow banning''' (also called '''stealth banning''', '''ghost banning''' or '''comment ghosting'''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;) is the act of [[Block (Internet)|blocking]] or partially blocking  a user or their content from an [[online community]] such that it will not be readily apparent to the user that they have been banned.

By making a user's contributions invisible or less prominent to other members of the service, the hope may be that in the absence of reactions to their comments, the problematic or otherwise out-of-favour user will become bored or frustrated and leave the site.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/17-04/st_thompson|title=Clive Thompson on the Taming of Comment Trolls|last=Thompson|first=Clive|date=29 March 2009|accessdate=6 July 2014|newspaper=Wired magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh2006" /&gt;

== Notable examples ==
In the mid-1980s, BBS forums including [[Citadel (software)|''Citadel'' BBS software]] had a "twit bit" for problematic users.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3q744/where-did-shadow-banning-come-from-trump-republicans-shadowbanned |title=Where Did the Concept of 'Shadow Banning' Come From? |date=2018-07-31 |work=Motherboard |access-date=2018-08-01 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/06/suspension-ban-or-hellban.html |title=Suspension, Ban or Hellban? |last=Atwood |first=Jeff |publisher=Coding Horror blog |accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When enabled, the user would have limited access, and commonly still be able to read public discussions; however, any messages posted by that "twit" would not be shown to the other users of that group.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citadel.org/doku.php/documentation:system_administration_manual |title=Manual installation of Citadel using source code and the command line client - Citadel.org |website=www.citadel.org |language=en |accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Pryor of [[Fog Creek Software]] described stealth banning for online forums in 2006, saying how such a system was in place in the project management system [[FogBugz]], "to solve the problem of how do you get the person to go away and leave you alone". As well as preventing problem users from engaging in [[flame war]]s, the system also discouraged [[spammer]]s, who if they returned to the site would be under the false impression that their spam was still in place.&lt;ref name="Walsh2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert Walsh|title=Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKuYXO-LKrcC|date=12 January 2006 |publisher=Apress |isbn=978-1-4302-0114-4 |page=183 |quote=So one of the things we did in FogBugz to solve the problem of how do you get the person to go away and leave you alone is, well, you take their post and make it invisible to everyone else, but they still see it. They won’t know they’ve been deleted. There’s no one fanning their flame. You can’t get into a flame war if no one responds to your criticism. So they get silenced and eventually just go away. We have several ways of telling if they come back, and it’s been proven to be extremely, extremely effective. Say a spammer posts to your board and then they come back to check if it’s still there, and they see it—to them it’s still there—but no one else sees it, so they’re not bothered by it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Verge]]'' describes it as "one of the oldest moderation tricks in the book", noting that early versions of [[vBulletin]] had a global ignore list known as "Tachy goes to Coventry",&lt;ref name="verge"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/16/14635030/twitter-shadow-ban-moderation |title=One of Twitter’s new anti-abuse measures is the oldest trick in the forum moderation book |last=Bohn |first=Dieter |date=2017-02-16 |website=The Verge |access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in the British expression "[[Send to Coventry|to send someone to Coventry]]", meaning to ignore them and pretend they don't exist.

A 2012 update to [[Hacker News]] introduced a system of "hellbanning" for spamming and abusive behavior.&lt;ref name="tc-evol"&gt;{{cite news |title = The Evolution of Hacker News |url = https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/18/the-evolution-of-hacker-news/ |publisher = TechCrunch |accessdate = 10 August 2014 |author = Leena Rao |date= May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pando.com/2013/12/04/can-the-democratic-power-of-a-platform-like-hacker-news-be-applied-to-products/ |title=Can the democratic power of a platform like Hacker News be applied to products? |date=2013-12-04 |work=Pando |access-date=2018-08-01 |language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Shadow banning" became popularized in 2018 as a conspiracy theory that Twitter had shadow-banned Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Romano|first=Aja|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/9/6/17824652/twitter-dorsey-energy-and-commerce-hearing-shadow-banning|title=How hysteria over Twitter shadow-banning led to a bizarre congressional hearing|publisher=Vox.com|date=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late July 2018, ''[[Vice News]]'' found that several supporters of the [[US Republican Party]] no longer appeared in the auto-populated drop-down search menu on Twitter, thus limiting their visibility when being searched for - allegedly due to the same algorithm that was being used to do the same to the accounts of prominent racists. &lt;ref name=Vice2018&gt;{{cite news |last=Thompson |first=Alex |date=26 July 2018 |title=Twitter appears to have fixed “shadow ban” of prominent Republicans like the RNC chair and Trump Jr.’s spokesman |url=https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/43paqq/twitter-is-shadow-banning-prominent-republicans-like-the-rnc-chair-and-trump-jrs-spokesman |work=Vice News |location= |access-date=15 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After that finding, some conservatives accused Twitter of enacting a shadowban on Republican accounts, which Twitter flatly denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/us/politics/twitter-shadowbanning.html |title=What Is a ‘Shadow Ban,’ and Is Twitter Doing It to Republican Accounts? |date=July 26, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/fruzsinaeordogh/2018/07/31/why-republicans-werent-the-only-ones-shadow-banned-on-twitter/#4b19426e434b |title=Why Republicans Weren't The Only Ones Shadow Banned On Twitter |date=July 31, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some accounts that were not overtly political or conservative apparently had the same algorithm applied to them. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In a blog post, Twitter said that the use of the phrase "shadow banning" was inaccurate, as the tweets were still visible by navigating to the home page of the relevant account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Setting the record straight on shadow banning |url=https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/Setting-the-record-straight-on-shadow-banning.html |website=Twitter |accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Twitter restored the affected accounts.&lt;ref name=Vice2018 /&gt;

At around 8:00 p.m [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]] on August 16, 2017, officers of the [[Philippine National Police]] (PNP) led by [[Police rank#Philippines|PO3]] Arnel Oares, were conducting a "one-time, big-time" anti-illegal drugs operation in Barangay 160, Caloocan where Delos Santos lived.&lt;ref name="CNN1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cops_kill" /&gt; During the anti-drug operation, Delos Santos went missing for almost an hour, which prompted his family to look for him at the nearest police station but failed to find him there. Several gunshots were then heard.&lt;ref name="GMA2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Grade 11 student killed during anti-drug op in Caloocan|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/metro/622230/grade-11-student-killed-during-anti-drug-op-in-caloocan/story/|accessdate=August 19, 2017|publisher=GMA News |date=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 8:57&amp;nbsp;p.m., C/Insp. Amor Cerillo and another police officer, both in plainclothes, arrived at the [[Barangay hall|hall]] of Barangay 160 to report a supposed shootout. In a muddy and dark alley near his house, which was the site of the alleged encounter, Delos Santos was found in fetal position with gunshot wounds to his head. Recovered from his corpse were a [[.45 caliber ammunition|.45-caliber]] pistol, four [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]], and two sachets of suspected [[methamphetamine]].&lt;ref name="CNN1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cops_kill" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Binatilyo" /&gt;

===Police report===
According to the official police report, at around 8:45 p.m, Delos Santos tried to flee when he noticed the police officers approaching him. He then drew his gun and "directly shot" towards the police, which prompted PO3 Arnel Oares to fire back in self-defense, killing Delos Santos. The pistol, cartridges, and two sachets of methamphetamine were then found in Delos Santos's possession.&lt;ref name="CNN1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Al_Jazeera" /&gt;&lt;ref name="News5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boy_17"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galupo|first1=Rey|last2=Tupas|first2=Emmanuel|last3=Ong|first3=Ghio|title=Boy, 17, killed in Caloocan drug operation|url=http://www.philstar.com:8080/metro/2017/08/18/1730174/boy-17-killed-caloocan-drug-operation|accessdate=August 19, 2017|newspaper=The Philippine Star |date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Binatilyo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Almelor|first1=Dominic|title=Binatilyo, patay nang 'manlaban' sa pulis; pero iba ang kuha sa CCTV|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/video/news/08/17/17/binatilyo-patay-nang-manlaban-sa-pulis-pero-iba-ang-kuha-sa-cctv|accessdate=August 19, 2017|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]] |date=August 17, 2017|language=Filipino}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cerillo and Bersaluna, a drug dealer that they earlier arrested claimed that Delos Santos was the [[Mule (smuggling)|mule]] of "Neneng" Escopino, a local drug dealer on the police watch list.&lt;ref name="Cops_kill" /&gt;&lt;ref name="4th_wit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Popioco|first1=Makoi|title=Fourth witness comes forward in Kian Loyd Delos Santos case|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2017/08/19/fourth-witness-kian-loyd-delos-santos.html|accessdate=August 19, 2017|publisher= CNN Philippines |date=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Witness accounts and CCTV footage===
Witnesses claim that Delos Santos was just loitering near his house at around 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., when two unidentified men grabbed him and led him away.&lt;ref name="Cops_kill" /&gt; The barangay's [[CCTV]] footage of the incident shows that at 8:24&amp;nbsp;p.m., a young man believed to be Delos Santos was being dragged by two men in plainclothes towards the area where his corpse would be later found. The video also showed a third man that headed towards the same direction.&lt;ref name="CNN1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="News5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Binatilyo" /&gt;

Cerillo confirmed that the two men in the video were plainclothes police officers. He also clarified that the person being dragged was not Delos Santos, but rather a police [[Asset (intelligence)|asset]].&lt;ref name="Cops_kill" /&gt; Bersaluna and Cirillo also clarified that police officers are not required to wear their uniforms during anti-illegal drugs operations.&lt;ref name="CNN1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cops_kill" /&gt;

Two witnesses who approached Dominic Almelor of [[ABS-CBN News]] claimed that Delos Santos was blindfolded by the two men and forced to hold a gun, fire it, and run.&lt;ref name="Binatilyo" /&gt; Another witness who approached Saleema Refran of [[GMA News]] claimed that Delos Santos begged for his life before getting shot. Afterwards, the shooters approached the witness and asked him if he knew the victim, which he denied. The witness later confirmed that the men who were filmed inside the barangay hall reporting the alleged shootout were the same men who shot Delos Santos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bajo|first1=Anna Felicia|title=Witness: Kian Delos Santos begged for his life before being killed by cops|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/metro/622446/witness-kian-delos-santos-begged-for-his-life-before-being-killed-by-cops/story/|accessdate=August 19, 2017|publisher=GMA News |date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 13-year-old witness interviewed by ''[[The Manila Bulletin]]'' claimed that she saw Delos Santos being punched and slapped by four armed plainclothes officers before he was dragged away.&lt;ref name="Manila_Bulletin"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Santos|first1=Jel|title='Tama na po.

Delos Santos's uncle, Randy, questioned the police claim that the victim had a concealed firearm, since his nephew was wearing [[Boxer shorts|boxers]] at that time.&lt;ref name="CNN1" /&gt; Delos Santos's father, Saldy, also pointed out that the pistol was recovered from the left hand of his otherwise right-handed son.&lt;ref name="News5" /&gt;

===Public response and protests===

===Public figures===
During a press briefing on August 18, [[Presidential Communications Group (Philippines)#Presidential Spokesperson|Presidential Spokesperson]] [[Ernesto Abella]] called the shooting of Delos Santos an "isolated" incident, and added "[President Duterte] will defend the police in their carrying out of duties.

The chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP), Director General [[Ronald dela Rosa]] expressed regret over Delos Santos's death, saying he was "very sorry for what happened".

===President Rodrigo Duterte===
When President Rodrigo Duterte saw the CCTV tape, he immediately called PNP Chief Ronald Bato Dela Rosa, and said "hulihin mo na at kulungin mo [ang mga pulis na dawit sa pagkasawi ni Kian]" (bring those policemen who are involved in Kian's killing to jail).

The case of Kian delos Santos has been likened to the cases of other teenagers, 19-year-old Carl Arnaiz and 14-year-old Reynaldo "Kulot" De Guzman.

Arnaiz went missing for ten days; his dead body found on August 28 in a morgue in [[Caloocan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/928639/carl-angelo-arnaiz-police-autopsy-crime-laboratory-bullet-wounds-northern-police-district-reynaldo-de-guzman|title=Carl Arnaiz sustained 5 bullet wounds in the body–NPD Crime Lab|last=Ballaran|first=Jhoanna|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Caloocan police Arnaiz was involved in a robbery at [[C-3 road]]. The police said that he declared a robbery to the driver of the vehicle he allegedly hit, and drew a gun. The driver reportedly sought help from the police and Arnaiz successfully shot PO1 Jefrey Perez and PO1 Ricky Arquta who in turn fired in retaliation causing the teenager's death. The police claimed in an August 30 report that they retrieved two packs of marijuana in his pocket and three packs of a substance suspected to be [[methamphetamine]] in his backpack.&lt;ref name=arnaiz&gt;{{cite news|last1=Viray|first1=Patricia Lourdes|title=What we know so far: Killing of Carl Arnaiz, 19|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/09/04/1735729/what-we-know-so-far-killing-carl-arnaiz|accessdate=12 September 2017|work=The Philippine Star|date=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Cainta]], [[Rizal]] resident, Arnaiz left his house with de Guzman to eat midnight snacks on August 17 according to his parents. Arnaiz's father says that his son's only vice is smoking and denied he possessed said contraband.&lt;ref name=arnaiz/&gt;

De Guzman's alleged body was found floating in Kinamatayang Kabayo creek in the town of [[Gapan]], [[Nueva Ecija]]. De Guzman's father theorized that his son may have been killed so he could not testify against the killers of Arnaiz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Carl Angelo Arnaiz's companion found dead in Nueva Ecija|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/624762/carl-angelo-arnaiz-s-companion-found-dead-in-nueva-ecija/story/|accessdate=12 September 2017|work=GMA News|date=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philippine National Police]] conducted a DNA test on the corpse and said that the body is not De Guzman's. However, his parents dispute the findings saying that they are certain that the body is that of their son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gotinga|first1=JC|title=PNP: Body found in Nueva Ecija creek not Reynaldo de Guzman|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/sports/2017/09/11/Reynaldo-De-Guzman-DNA-test-Carl-Arnaiz.html|accessdate=12 September 2017|work=CNN Philippines|date=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''T in the Park festival''' was a major Scottish [[music festival]] that was held annually from 1994-2016. It is named after its main sponsor, the brewing company [[Tennents]]. The event was originally held at [[Strathclyde Park]], [[Lanarkshire]] but was held at the disused [[Balado, Kinross|Balado]] airfield, [[Kinross-shire]] from 1997 to 2014. In 2015 the festival moved to Strathallan Castle, [[Strathallan]], [[Perthshire]]. Originally a two-day event, the festival became a three-day event in 2007. Promoted by [[DF Concerts]], the event attracts up to 255,000 people, along with 70,000 campers. 

The 2017 event was cancelled due to problems at the 2016 event. It was officially replaced with the [[TRNSMT]] festival which takes place on the same weekend at [[Glasgow Green]]. The 2017 festival was a success and was followed in 2018 with TRNSMT again. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=T in the Park 'not looking likely' for 2018|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-40593239|publisher=BBC|accessdate=27 July 2017|date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The festival was founded in 1994 by Stuart Clumpas and Geoff Ellis,&lt;ref name=bbc-20000712&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/830160.stm |title=Clumpas has success down to a T |publisher=BBC |date=12 July 2000 |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a joint venture between [[DF Concerts]] and [[Tennent's Lager]] with some help from Irish promotions company [[MCD Productions]].&lt;ref name=freelibrary/&gt; Stuart Clumpas left as an organiser in 2001, selling his commercial interests in the concert.&lt;ref name=heraldscotland-20010908&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12230344.Why_I_apos_m_getting_out_of_here/ |title=Why I'm getting out of here |newspaper=The Hearld |location=Scotland |date=8 September 2001 |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cloonan-frith&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_168676_en.pdf |title=Promoting Business – DF Concerts |author=Martin Cloonan, Simon Frith |publisher=University of Glasgow |year=2010 |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current festival director Geoff Ellis was involved from the start. Ellis came to Scotland in 1992 to manage [[King Tut's Wah Wah Hut]] in Glasgow. He organised the first T in the Park festival in 1994 with a smattering of bands playing to 17,000 people at its original site at [[Strathclyde Park]], [[Lanarkshire]].&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/entertainment/music/geoff-ellis-the-man-who-created-t-in-the-park-130169n.21568491|title=Geoff Ellis, the man who created T in the Park|work=[[Evening Times]] |last=Ellis|first=Maureen|date=11 July 2013|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival was held there for three years until 1997, where it was held at the disused [[Balado, Kinross|Balado]] airfield, [[Kinross-shire]]. After moving to Balado the festival grew larger and by 2003, the festival was attracting up to 255,000 people; 110,000 over the weekend.&lt;ref name=freelibrary&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/T+IN+THE+PARK+v+GLASTONBURY%3B+T+IN+THE+PARK.-a0105041000|title=T IN THE PARK v GLASTONBURY; T IN THE PARK|publisher=[[TheFreeLibrary.com]]|website=Daily Record|date=10 July 2003|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival was originally a two-day event until 2007, when the Friday became a mainstay event for live music. However, the 2007 festival was criticised by many festival-goers who missed acts on the Friday due to huge traffic jams of 10 miles on the [[A91 road|A91]] and [[A977 road (Great Britain)|A977]] leading to Kinross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6275754.stm|title=Traffic chaos hits T in the Park|publisher=BBC|date=6 July 2007|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent a repeat of the traffic chaos, in 2008 organisers allowed a limited number of campers to pitch up on the Thursday in order to cut the number of cars on the roads on the Friday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/tayside_and_central/7243751.stm|title=Earlier camping for T in the Park|publisher=BBC|date=14 February 2008|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By extending the festival over a full three days, it began to grow rapidly, becoming the second-largest greenfield festival in the United Kingdom, and the fifth-largest in the world in terms of attendance, with over 85,000 people on site everyday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/42150834/page/6|title=The Worlds's Biggest Music Festivals|publisher=[[CNBC]]|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, it attracted up to 255,000 people over three days, drawing fans from across Britain and Europe.&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt; According to DF Concerts, 20% of the crowd is made up of visitors from outside Scotland, with about 2% attending from overseas.&lt;ref name=herald/&gt; In recent years, the festival has shared much of its line-up with [[Oxegen]], a festival that takes place on the same weekend in [[County Kildare]], [[Ireland]]. Acts usually play T in the Park one day and Oxegen the next, or vice versa. In an attempt to boost ticket sales, the 2014 festival saw an extension of the acts' duration on stage. On the Friday, the acts were scheduled to start around lunchtime as opposed to 5&amp;nbsp;pm; and the Saturday headliners to finish at 1&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/what-s-on/music/t-in-the-park-2014-lineup-revealed-1-3319719|title=T in the Park 2014 lineup revealed|work=The Scotsman|last=Ferguson|first=Brian|date=26 February 2014|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move from Balado to Strathallan===
The 2014 festival was the last to take place at the Balado site. Despite having run on the same site since 1997, safety concerns were expressed about the [[Forties pipeline system|Forties Pipeline]], which runs directly underneath the former Balado airfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-26181095|title=Pipeline concern for T in the park|publisher=BBC|date=13 February 2014|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the festival moved 20.54 miles to the [[Strathallan]] Castle Estate in the neighbouring county of Perthshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/showbiz/t-in-the-park-unveils-castle-move-1.440782|title=Error messages – The Courier – At the heart of Tayside and Fife|work=thecourier.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 event was marred by the deaths of three festival-goers and reports of anti-social behaviour problems at the campsite. This led festival bosses to cancel the 2017 event, making the festival's future uncertain.&lt;ref name="Ned"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/music/t-in-the-park-s-demise-would-be-a-victory-for-the-neds-1-4304583|title=T in the Park’s demise ‘would be a victory for the neds’|publisher=''The Scotsman''|last=Ferguson|first=Brian|date=30 November 2016|access-date=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brewing===
Tennents Lager is brewed just 36 hours before T in the Park at the [[Wellpark Brewery]] in [[Glasgow]], 44 miles from Balado. Nearly all the lager is brewed specifically for the weekend. More than 3 million pints of lager have been consumed at the festival since 1994.&lt;ref name=herald&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/music/t-in-the-park-facts-and-figures.2013072948|title=T in the Park: facts and figures|publisher=''[[The Herald (Scotland)|The Herald]]''|date=11 July 2013|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An innovative bar-cup recycling scheme was introduced in 2006 paying a 10p deposit on every empty pint container brought back to a designated recycling point.&lt;ref name=herald/&gt;

==1994 festival==
The first T in the Park was held on Saturday 30 July – Sunday 31 July 1994 at [[Strathclyde Country park]]. The site had a capacity for 17,000 people on each of the two days,  with just 2000 choosing to camp.&lt;ref name=scotsman2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/what-s-on/music/love-loathing-and-t-in-the-park-1-907854|title=Love, loathing and T in the Park|publisher=''[[The Scotsman]]''|first=Doug |last=Johnstone|first2=Andrew |last2=Eaton|date=5 July 2007|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Caledonia Stage, was introduced to showcase up and coming new bands. A band called Glass Onion played over the weekend who would later be better known as [[Travis (band)|Travis]].

==1996 festival==
Was held on Saturday 13 July – Sunday 14 July 1996, and was the last time at [[Strathclyde Country park]].  The Saturday was a sell out for the first time in advance. Radiohead closed the Main Stage on Saturday night and Pulp closing on the Sunday. This was also the year that Keanu Reeves arrived on a shuttle bus to play the festival with his band Dogstar, and Joe Strummer busked in the campsite

Caledonia Stage was renamed the '''T Break''', where unsigned acts from across Scotland are given a platform to showcase their music at T in the Park. Each year, a panel made up of music industry experts hand-picked 16 artists from over a thousand entries to platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennents.com/tbreak/about-t-break/ |title=About T Break – Tennent's T Break |publisher=Tennents.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other acts on the bill include [[Pixies]], [[Ed Sheeran]], [[Paolo Nutini]], [[Paul Weller]], [[The Human League]], [[Pharrell Williams]], [[Ellie Goulding]], [[Tinie Tempah]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]], [[James (band)|James]] and [[Charlotte OC]].

'''''The Cat's Meow''''' is a 2001 [[Period piece|period]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Peter Bogdanovich]], and starring [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Edward Herrmann]], [[Cary Elwes]], [[Joanna Lumley]] and [[Jennifer Tilly]]. The [[screenplay]] by [[Steven Peros]] is based on his play of the same title, which was inspired by the mysterious death of film mogul [[Thomas H. Ince]] that occurred on [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s boat with [[Charles Chaplin]] on board.

The film takes place aboard publisher [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s yacht on a weekend cruise celebrating Ince's 44th birthday on November 16, 1924. Among those in attendance are Hearst's longtime companion and film actress [[Marion Davies]], fellow actor [[Charlie Chaplin]], writer [[Elinor Glyn]], columnist [[Louella Parsons]], and actress [[Margaret Livingston]]. The celebration is cut short by an unusual death that would go on to become the subject of legendary Hollywood [[folklore]].

==Plot==
November 15, 1924: Among those boarding the luxury yacht ''[[USS Oneida (SP-432)|Oneida]]'' in [[San Pedro, California]] are its owner, publishing magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]], and his mistress, [[silent film]] star [[Marion Davies]]; motion picture mogul [[Thomas H. Ince]], whose birthday is the reason for the weekend cruise, and his mistress, starlet [[Margaret Livingston]] (who would portray "the Woman From the City" in [[F.W. Murnau]]'s ''[[Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans]]'' three years later); international film star [[Charlie Chaplin]]; English writer [[Elinor Glyn]]; and [[Louella Parsons]], a film critic for Hearst's ''[[New York Journal-American|New York American]]''.

Several of those participating in the weekend's festivities are at a crossroads in their lives and/or careers. Chaplin, still dealing with the critical and commercial failure of ''[[A Woman of Paris]]'' and rumors he has impregnated 16-year-old [[Lita Grey]] (who appeared in his film ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]'') is in the midst of preparing ''[[The Gold Rush]]''. Davies longs to appear in a slapstick comedy rather than the somber costume dramas to which Hearst has kept her confined. Ince's eponymous film studio is in dire financial straits, so he hopes to convince Hearst to take him on as a partner in [[Cosmopolitan Productions|Cosmopolitan Pictures]]. Parsons would like to relocate from the East Coast to more glamorous Hollywood.

Hearst suspects Davies and Chaplin have engaged in an affair, a suspicion shared by Ince, who seeks proof he can present to Hearst in order to curry favor with him. In the wastepaper basket in Chaplin's stateroom, Ince discovers a discarded love letter to Davies and pockets it with plans to produce it at an opportune moment. When he finally does, Hearst is enraged. His anger is fueled further when he finds a brooch he had given Davies in Chaplin's cabin. Hearst concludes it was lost there during a romantic liaison, and he rifles Marion's room for further evidence.

Armed with a pistol, Hearst searches the yacht for Chaplin in the middle of the night. Ince, meanwhile, runs into Davies and the two sit and talk with Ince donning a hat Chaplin had worn.  Davies explains to Ince her love for Hearst and her regret at an earlier affair with Chaplin.  She states "I never loved him" just as Hearst arrives behind them.  Thinking Davies is referring to him, and mistaking Ince for Chaplin, a jealous Hearst shoots Ince.  The assault is witnessed by Parsons, who had heard noises and went to investigate.

Hearst arranges to dock in [[San Diego]] and have a waiting ambulance take the dying Ince home. He phones the injured man's wife and tells her Ince attempted [[suicide]] when Livingston tried to end their affair, assuring her the truth won't reach the media. To the rest of his guests he announces Ince's [[peptic ulcer|ulcer]] flared up and required immediate medical attention. Davies, of course, knows the truth, and confides in Chaplin. Also armed with that knowledge is Parsons, who assures Hearst his secret will be safe in exchange for a lifetime contract with the [[Hearst Corporation]], thus laying the groundwork for her lengthy career as one of Hollywood's most powerful gossip columnists.

After seeing Ince off, Hearst confronts Davies and Chaplin. He is berated by Chaplin, who expects Davies to join him. Hearst, however, challenges Chaplin to guarantee Davies that he can promise her a happy life. When Chaplin fails to answer, Hearst informs Chaplin of the vow of silence he and the fellow guests have made to keep the weekend's activities a secret. Chaplin despairs as he realizes the murder has strengthened Davies' love for Hearst.

The film concludes with the guests leaving Ince's funeral, as Glyn relates what became of them:
* Livingston went on to star in a number of successful films and her film salary "inexplicably" went from $300 to $1000 a film.
* Davies starred in more of Hearst's films before finally being allowed to feature in a comedy ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]],'' which was (as Chaplin predicted) a success. She stayed by Hearst's side until his death in 1951.
* Chaplin married his teenage lover [[Lita Grey]] in [[Mexico]] and his film ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' was an overwhelming success.
* Parsons worked for Hearst for many years and subsequently became one of the most successful writers in the history of American journalism.

Tom Ince was largely forgotten after the events of his death. Very few newspapers reported it, no police action was taken, and of all the people on board only one was ever questioned. It is concluded that in Hollywood, "the place just off the coast of the planet Earth," no two accounts of the story are the same.

==Background==

[[Image:Oneida (SP-432) edit.jpg|right|thumb|The ''Oneida'', in the July 1916 issue of the yachting journal ''The Rudder'']]
Film scholar [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]], editor of the 1992 book ''[[This is Orson Welles]]'' — a record of interviews Peter Bogdanovich conducted with Orson Welles — began his April 2002 review of ''The Cat's Meow'' with this exchange about ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941):

&lt;blockquote&gt;OW: In the original script we had a scene based on a notorious thing Hearst had done, which I still cannot repeat for publication. And I cut it out because I thought it hurt the film and wasn’t in keeping with Kane’s character. If I’d kept it in, I would have had no trouble with Hearst. He wouldn’t have dared admit it was him.&lt;br&gt;PB: Did you shoot the scene?&lt;br&gt;OW: No, I didn’t. I decided against it. If I’d kept it in, I would have bought silence for myself forever.&lt;ref&gt;[[Orson Welles|Welles, Orson]], and [[Peter Bogdanovich]], edited by [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]], ''This is Orson Welles''. New York: HarperCollins Publishers 1992 {{ISBN|0-06-016616-9}} page 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"The incident Welles alluded to in this exchange is the subject of ''The Cat’s Meow'', directed by Bogdanovich and adapted by Steven Peros from his own play," Rosenbaum wrote. "Bogdanovich may see Welles as the inspiration for his film, but I have no idea where Peros got his facts."

Rosenbaum did find a similar story in the 1979 edition of ''The Film Encyclopedia'' by [[Ephraim Katz]], in the entry on Thomas Ince; and in the [[Raising Kane|1971 essay on ''Citizen Kane'']]&lt;ref&gt;[[Pauline Kael|Kael, Pauline]], "[[Raising Kane]]", book-length essay in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (February 20 and 27, 1971); reprinted in ''The Citizen Kane Book''. Kael, Pauline, [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] and [[Orson Welles]], ''The Citizen Kane Book''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company 1971, {{ISBN|0-436-23030-5}}  pp. 1–85&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Pauline Kael]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Her principal source was [[John Houseman]], script supervisor for cowriter [[Herman Mankiewicz]], and it seems safe to conclude, even without her prodding, that some version of the story must have cropped up in Mankiewicz’s first draft of the script, which Welles subsequently edited and added to. According to Kael, the only trace of the subplot left in the script is a speech made by Susan Alexander, who was loosely based on Davies, to the reporter Thompson about Kane: “Look, if you’re smart, you’ll get in touch with Raymond. He’s the butler. You’ll learn a lot from him. He knows where all the bodies are buried.” Kael writes, “It’s an odd, cryptic speech. In the first draft, Raymond ''literally'' knew where the bodies were buried: Mankiewicz had dished up a nasty version of the scandal sometimes referred to as the Strange Death of Thomas Ince."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"I don’t think we’re likely ever to know for sure what happened on Hearst’s yacht on November 19, 1924," Rosenbaum concluded.&lt;ref name=Rosenbaum&gt;[[Jonathan Rosenbaum|Rosenbaum, Jonathan]], [http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/?p=6233 "Hollywood Confidential: 'The Cat's Meow'".] ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', April 26, 2002, archived at JonathanRosenbaum.net. Retrieved 5 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

"No director is more steeped in Hearst/Welles/Kane/Hollywood lore than Bogdanovich," wrote film critic [[Roger Ebert]], who heard the Orson Welles version of Thomas Ince's death from Bogdanovich. "It happened that as Bogdanovich told me this story, we were aboard the QE2, crossing to Southampton on the 25th anniversary voyage of the Telluride Film Festival in 1998. When Bogdanovich returned to New York, there was a script waiting for him. It was an adaptation of Steven Peros' play about the very same scandal. Fate was sending him a message."&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]], [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040424/PEOPLE/44010302 "Peter Bogdanovich on storytelling".] ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', April 24, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 interview Bogdanovich said, "I was talking to Orson for my book, ''This is Orson Welles'' in 1969 and he said, “You know about the thing that happened on Hearst’s yacht?” He said Welles had been told the story by screenwriter [[Charles Lederer]], Marion Davies's nephew, and that Bogdanovich subsequently confirmed the account with Lederer. "And when Orson told me that story it was virtually the same story as what Steven Peros has written. The particulars in terms of the letter or the hat, those where details hypothesized by Steven, based on his research, but the actual plot — of what happened and who was doing what and why — that was all the same."&lt;ref&gt;French, Lawrence, [http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=213 "Peter Bogdanovich on completing Orson Welles long awaited The Other Side of the Wind for Showtime"] (March 9, 2008 interview).

==Production==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
Peter Bogdanovich wanted to shoot ''The Cat's Meow'' in [[black-and-white]] to capture the feel of the silent movie era, but studio heads objected. (Black-and-white scenes of Ince's funeral, resembling old [[newsreel]] footage, bookend the film.) To compensate, the director ordered [[costume design]]er Caroline de Vivaise to dress the cast in only black and white. With only a few weeks to prepare prior to the start of filming, she resorted to shopping in secondhand stores for vintage clothing. Bogdanovich agreed to her request to have some silver and gold on the costumes when many of the pieces she found were trimmed with those colors.

The vessel used to represent the Oneida was actually the ''Marala''. She was originally named ''Evadne'', the private yacht of [[Charles Richard Fairey|Charles Fairey]] of [[Fairey Aviation]], and had patrolled the approaches to [[Bermuda]], and its [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]], during the [[Second World War]] as [[HMS Evadne|HMS ''Evadne'']].

Composer [[Ian Whitcomb]]'s score was augmented by original recordings that were popular during the period in which the film takes place. These included "[[Avalon (Al Jolson song)|Avalon]]," "Toot Toot Tootsie," and "California, Here I Come" by [[Al Jolson]]; "Everybody Loves My Baby" and "Wild Cat Blues" by [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]]; "Stumbling," "Say It With Music," "Somebody Loves Me," and "Linger Awhile" by [[Paul Whiteman]]; and "Wabash Blues" by [[Fletcher Henderson]]. In addition, Ian Whitcomb &amp; His Bungalow Boys performed many tunes from the era, among them "Ain't We Got Fun," "I'm Just Wild About Harry," "[[St. Louis Blues (song)|St. Louis Blues]]," "A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody," "I'm Nobody's Baby," "Rose of Washington Square," "If You Were the Only Girl in the World," "[[Margie (song)|Margie]]," "How Ya Gonna Keep 'Em Down on the Farm (After They've Seen Paree)?," and "[[Alice Blue Gown]]."

After the film had been completed, [[music supervisor]] Joel C. High realised the version of "Charleston" heard in the birthday party scene was a jazz-tinged arrangement from the 1950s and had Ian Whitcomb &amp; His Bungalow Boys record an authentic 1920s rendition to replace it. Bogdanovich preferred the livelier, more contemporary sound of the 1950s version but finally was convinced by High to use the more accurate recording.

==Release==
The film premiered at the [[Locarno Film Festival]] in August 2001. It was shown at the 2001 Flanders International Film Festival in [[Belgium]], the 2001 MIFED Film Market in [[Italy]], the 2002 [[International Film Festival Rotterdam]], and the 2002 [[Mar del Plata Film Festival]] in [[Argentina]] before going into limited release in the US in April 2002.

The film grossed $3,209,481 in the United States and $437,513 internationally for a worldwide total of $3,646,994.&lt;ref name="mojo"/&gt;

==Reception==
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a score of 75% based on reviews from 124 critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cats_meow/|title=The Cat's Meow |last=Staff|work= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' film critic [[A. O. Scott]] called the film "a modest, restrained picture, as small and satisfying as one of [[Woody Allen]]'s better recent efforts. There is little to distinguish it visually from a made-for-cable historical drama. We observe the events from a polite distance, rather than being plunged into the swirl of decadent Jazz Age high life. The suave camera movements never quite dispel the feeling that we are watching a filmed play. But Mr. Bogdanovich … shows his mastery in his work with the actors, who turn dusty Tinseltown lore into a spry and touching entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;[[A. O. Scott|Scott, A.O.]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/12/movies/12MEOW.html "A Mystery Looming Larger Than Rosebud".] ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 12, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

"Apart from its theory about the mistaken death of Ince and its cover-up, the movie's most intriguing theory is that Parsons witnessed it, which might explain her lifetime contract with the Hearst papers," wrote [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. "The film is darkly atmospheric, with Herrmann quietly suggesting the sadness and obsession beneath Hearst's forced avuncular chortles. Dunst is as good, in her way, as [[Dorothy Comingore]] in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' in showing a woman who is more loyal and affectionate than her lover deserves."&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]], [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020426/REVIEWS/204260301/1023 "The Cat's Meow"] ''Chicago Sun-Times'', April 26, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

"In some ways, Dunst gives the film’s most impressive performance," wrote [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]], who called the film a must-see. "What’s masterful about Bogdanovich’s direction is the cumulative detail, which adds complexity to incidental as well as central characters. He has a graceful way of switching viewpoints from one character to another and an uninsistent yet mainly persuasive sense of period. … This picture might well be considered a more impressive accomplishment than many of his early pictures. But it speaks with a quieter voice, and what it says seems substantially more personal and thoughtful."&lt;ref name=Rosenbaum /&gt;

In the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', [[Mick LaSalle]] stated, "Bogdanovich takes a tale of old Hollywood and infuses it with velocity and enthusiasm. He avoids his twin demons, freneticism and cuteness, and delivers his best picture in years ... His deft use of a single location, his intelligent handling of his ensemble cast and his graceful camera work mark this as a true return to form."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mick LaSalle|LaSalle, Mick]], [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/04/26/DD134840.DTL "Dunst delivers 'The Cat's Meow'; Bogdanovich's classic murder tale is on course."] ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' April 26, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Derek Elley of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the film as "playful and sporty … Dunst gives her best performance to date amid a skilled older cast. Believable as both a spoiled ingenue and a lover to two very different men, Dunst endows a potentially lightweight character with considerable depth and sympathy."&lt;ref&gt;Elley, Derek, [http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117798620.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 "The Cat's Meow".] ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', August 5, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=November 2018}}

"Elegant, funny and unexpectedly touching, this whodunit about a murder aboard the yacht of William Randolph Hearst represents a bracing comeback for Peter Bogdanovich," wrote ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' film critic [[Peter Travers]]. "Dunst, the teen queen of ''[[Bring It On (film)|Bring It On]]'' and ''[[Crazy/Beautiful]]'', is showstoppingly good, finding humor, heart and surprising gravity in a character often dismissed as a [[wikt:gold digger|gold digger]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Travers|Travers, Peter]], [https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/the-cats-meow-20020327 "The Cat's Meow".] ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', April 12, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

James Christopher of ''[[The Times]]'' wrote, "The unexpected charm of Bogdanovich's film is that he paints a social scenario worthy of ''[[Decline and Fall]]''. His cast are comically hollow and effortlessly insincere … Kirsten Dunst is a marvellous tease as Marion; Eddie Izzard is a manly Chaplin; and Herrmann is hypnotic as the infatuated host who is richer than God."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, James, "Of mummers and mysteries". ''[[The Times]]'' (London), June 3, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Kevin Thomas stated, "Peter Bogdanovich, who knows his Hollywood history probably better than any other American director, works from Steven Peros' amusing yet poignant script to tell the popular version of the legend in clever and entertaining fashion, loaded with authentic and convincing details."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie000025986apr12,0,6507559.story ''Los Angeles Times'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2013}}

"What a tonic to be treated to a movie for that most uncourted, ignored and generally dissed of [[demographics]]: the grown-ups," wrote Ann Hornaday of ''[[The Washington Post]]''. "Based on an urban legend that has been quietly circulating around Hollywood for almost four decades, ''The Cat's Meow'' would be grounds for libel if the libeled one were still alive … Bogdanovich directs ''The Cat's Meow'' with unfussy clarity, introducing a crowded cast of characters with quick scenes that immediately convey who they are and what they're up to. In the 1970s films ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' and ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'', Bogdanovich coaxed some wonderful performances from his actors, and he clearly hasn't lost that touch: Herrmann inhabits Hearst completely (he even bears an uncanny physical resemblance to the late publisher). Dunst, heretofore relegated to kittenish teen roles, comes as close to capturing Davies' effervescence and spontaneity as anyone has (and no one has). Izzard is also very good as Chaplin."&lt;ref&gt;Hornaday, Ann, "'Cat's Meow': The Bee's Knees; Bogdanovich Quietly Evokes the Roaring Twenties". ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 3, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

"Bogdanovich's silent crosscutting between close-ups of the characters helps to shorn the film of its theatrical origins," wrote Peter Tonguette in ''The Film Journal''. "Bogdanovich's sensitivity towards his characters and outright insistence that we see even the most gluttonous and poisonous among them as human beings is rare, and commendable, indeed."&lt;ref&gt;Tonguette, Peter, [http://www.thefilmjournal.com/issue2/catsmeow.html "The Cat's Meow".] ''The Film Journal'', [http://www.thefilmjournal.com/issue2/issue2index.html Issue 2], July 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trafficking of children''' (aka "Child Labor" and "Child Exploitation) is a form of [[human trafficking]] and is defined as the "recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, and/or receipt" of a child for the purpose of 
slavery, forced labor and exploitation.&lt;ref name="United Nations 2000"/&gt;{{Rp|Article 3 (c)}} This definition is substantially wider than the same document's definition of "trafficking in persons".&lt;ref name="United Nations 2000"/&gt;{{Rp|Article 3 (a)}} Children may also be trafficked for the purpose of [[adoption]].

Though statistics regarding the magnitude of child trafficking are difficult to obtain, the [[International Labour Organization]] estimates that 1.2 million children are trafficked each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[ILO|ILO-IPEC]]|title=Child Trafficking - Essentials |url=https://www.ilo.org/ipecinfo/product/download.do?type=document&amp;id=14616 |publisher=ILO |location=Geneva|year=2010|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the (UNODC) United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reports the percentage of child victims had risen in a 3 year span from 20 per cent to 27 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://arkofhopeforchildren.org/child-trafficking/child-trafficking-statistics|title=What are the statistics on human trafficking of children?|work=Ark of Hope for Children|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of every three child victims, two are girls and one is a boy.

Yet, it is only within the past decade that the prevalence and ramifications of this practice have risen to international prominence, due to a dramatic increase in research and public action. A variety of potential solutions have accordingly been suggested and implemented, which can be categorized as four types of action: broad protection, prevention, law enforcement, and victim assistance. {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The main international documents dealing with the trafficking of children are the 1989 [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child]], the 1999 [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention|I.L.O. Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]] and the 2000 [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children|U.N. Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]].

== Definition ==
The first major international instrument dealing with the trafficking of children is part of the 2000 United Nations [[Palermo protocols]], titled the [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]]. Article 3(a) of this document defines child trafficking as the "recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring and/or receipt" of a child for the purpose of exploitation.&lt;ref name="United Nations 2000"/&gt; The definition for child trafficking given here applies only to cases of trafficking that are transnational and/or involve organized criminal groups; in spite of this, child trafficking is now typically recognized well outside these parameters.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ILO |last2=UNICEF |last3=UN.GIFT|title=Training Manual to Fight Child Trafficking in Children for Labour, Sexual and Other Forms of Exploitation – Textbook 1: Understanding Child Trafficking|year=2009|url=http://www.unicef.org/protection/Textbook_1.pdf|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Labour Organization]] expands upon this definition by asserting that movement and exploitation are key aspects of child trafficking.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; The definition of "child" used here is that listed in the 1989 [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child]] which states, "a child means every human being below the age of 18 years, unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier."&lt;ref name="United Nations 1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last=United Nations |title=Convention on the Rights of the Child |year=1989 |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |accessdate=March 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |archivedate=June 11, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction outlined in this definition is important, because some countries have chosen to set the "age of majority" lower than 18, thus influencing exactly what legally constitutes child trafficking.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;

=== Related legal instruments ===
Many international, regional, and national instruments deal with the trafficking of children. These instruments are used to define what legally constitutes trafficking of children, such that appropriate legal action can be taken against those who engage in and promote this practice. These legal instruments are called by a variety of terms, including conventions, protocols, memorandums, joint actions, recommendations, and declarations. The most significant instruments are listed below:&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;

==== International human rights instruments ====
These legal instruments were developed by the [[United Nations]] in an effort to protect international human rights and, more specifically, children's rights.

* Mekong sub regional cooperation agreement to fight human trafficking (COMMIT), 2004

==== National law ====
{{see also|Human trafficking in the United States|Human trafficking in the United Kingdom}}
National laws pertaining to child trafficking continue to develop worldwide, based on the international principles that have been established. Anti-trafficking legislation has been lauded as critical by the [[United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking]], because it ensures that traffickers and trafficking victims are treated accordingly: for example, "if migration laws are used to pursue traffickers, it is often the case that the victims too are prosecuted as illegal migrants, whereas if there is a specific category of 'trafficker' and 'trafficked person,' then it is more likely that the victim will be treated as such."&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; The existence of national laws regarding child trafficking also enables trafficking victims and/or their families to take appropriate civil action.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;

== Types of child trafficking ==
The intended or actual after-sale use of the child is not always known.

=== Forced labour ===
{{see also|Child labour}}
The objective of child trafficking is often forced child labour.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; Child labour refers specifically to children under a stipulated minimum age, usually 14 at the lowest, being required to work.&lt;ref name="min age conv 1973"/&gt; [[UNICEF]] estimates that, in 2011, 150 million children aged 5–14 in developing countries were involved in child labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNICEF|title=State of the World's Children 2011: Adolescence, an Age of Opportunity|year=2011|url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc2011/pdfs/SOWC-2011-Main-Report_EN_02092011.pdf|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this number, the [[International Labour Organization]] reports that 60% of child workers work in agriculture.&lt;ref name="I.L.O. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=I.L.O.|title=Fast Facts on Child Labour 2010|year=2010|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@dgreports/@dcomm/documents/publication/wcms_126685.pdf|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ILO also estimates that 115 million children are engaged in hazardous work, such as the sex or drug trade.&lt;ref name="I.L.O. 2010" /&gt;  Overall, child labor can take many forms, including domestic servitude, work in agriculture, service, and manufacturing industries. Also, according to several researchers, most children are forced into cheap and controllable labor, and work in homes, farms, factories, restaurants, and much more (Beyrer 16; Gozdziak and MacDonnell 171; Vinkovic 88). Trafficked children may be sexually exploited, used in the armed forces and drug trades, and in child begging.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; In terms of global trends, the ILO estimates that in 2004–2008, there was a 3% reduction in the incidence of child labor; this stands in contrast to a previous ILO report which found that in 2000–2004, there was a 10% reduction in child labor.&lt;ref name="I.L.O. 2010" /&gt; The ILO contends that, globally, child labour is slowly declining, except in sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of child workers has remained relatively constant: 1 in 4 children aged 5–17 work in this region.&lt;ref name="I.L.O. 2010"/&gt; Another major global trend concerns the number of child laborers in the 15-17 age group: in the past five years, a 20% increase in the number of these child workers has been reported.&lt;ref name="I.L.O. 2010" /&gt; A surprised example has occurred in the United States as McCabe (2008) indicates that in the 1990s, huge companies such as Gap and Nike were using industries “sweatshops” that use trafficked children to make their desired products (p.&amp;nbsp;81).&lt;ref&gt;Mccabe, K.

=== Sexual exploitation ===
{{Main article|Commercial sexual exploitation of children}}
{{Sex and the law}}
[[Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography|The Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography]] is a protocol of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], formally adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="www2.ohchr.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last=United Nations|title=Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography|year=2000|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc-sale.htm|accessdate=March 10, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310131154/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc-sale.htm|archivedate=March 10, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, this protocol formally requires states to prohibit the sale of children, child prostitution, and child pornography.&lt;ref name="www2.ohchr.org"/&gt; According to the [[International Labour Organization]], sexual exploitation of children includes all of the following practices and activities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=I.L.O.|title=Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/CSEC/lang--en/index.htm|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* "The use of girls and boys in sexual activities remunerated in cash or in kind (commonly known as child prostitution) in the streets or indoors, in such places as brothels, discotheques, massage parlours, bars, hotels, restaurants, etc."
* "The trafficking of girls and boys and adolescents for the sex trade"
* "Child sex tourism"
* "The production, promotion and distribution of pornography involving children"
* "The use of children in sex shows (public or private)"
Though measuring the extent of this practice is difficult due to its criminal and covert nature, the [[International Labour Organization]] estimates that there are as many as 1.8 million children sexually trafficked worldwide, while UNICEF's 2006 State of the World's Children Report reports this number to be 2 million.&lt;ref name="I.L.O"&gt;{{cite journal|last=I.L.O.|title=Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents: The I.L.O.'s Response|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/CSEC/lang--en/index.htm|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNICEF|title=The State of the World's Children 2006: Excluded and Invisible|year=2006|url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc06/index.php|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Labour Organization]] has found that girls involved in other forms of child labour - such as domestic service or street vending - are at the highest risk of being pulled into commercial child sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="I.L.O"/&gt; Likewise, Kendall and Funk justifies how “young girls age 12 and under are malleable and more easily trained into their prospective roles as prostitutes, and because virginity is highly prized by certain consumers willing to pay a premium” (31).A variety of sources, including the [[International Labour Organization|I.L.O]], and scholars Erin Kunze and D.M. Hughes, also contend that the increased use and availability of the Internet has served as a major resource for traffickers, ultimately increasing the incidence of child sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="I.L.O"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kunze|first=Erin I.|title=Sex Trafficking Via the Internet: How International Agreements Address the Problem and Fail to Go Far Enough|journal=Journal of High Technology Law|year=2010|volume=10|series=241-289|url=http://www.jhtl.org/docs/pdf/kunze_formatted_10jhtl241.pdf|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=D.M.|title=The Internet and Sex Industries: Partners in Global Sexual Exploitation|journal=Technology and Society Magazine|year=Spring 2000|volume=19|issue=1|pages=35–42|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=828562&amp;tag=1|accessdate=March 12, 2012|doi=10.1109/44.828562}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in 2009, Illinois Sheriff Thomas J.

=== Children in armed forces ===
{{Main article|Military use of children}}
[[Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict|The Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict]] is a protocol of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], formally adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite journal|last=United Nations|title=Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict|year=2000|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc-conflict.htm|accessdate=March 12, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304201115/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc-conflict.htm|archivedate=March 4, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the protocol states that while volunteers below the age of 18 can voluntarily join the armed forces, they cannot be conscripted. As the [[Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict|Protocol]] reads, "State parties shall take all feasible measures to ensure that member of their armed forces who have not attained the age of 18 years do not take a direct part in hostilities."&lt;ref name="http"/&gt; Despite this, the [[International Labour Organization]] estimates that "tens of thousands" of girls and boys are currently forcibly enlisted in the armed forces in at least 17 countries around the world.&lt;ref name="ilo.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=I.L.O.|title=Child Labour and Armed Conflict|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/Armedconflict/lang--en/index.htm|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children conscripted into the armed forces can then be used in three distinct ways:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=International Bureau for Children's Rights|title=Children and Armed Conflict: A Guide to International Humanitarian and Human Rights Law|year=2010|url=http://www.ibcr.org/editor/assets/Conflict_Eng.pdf|accessdate=March 11, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806071249/http://www.ibcr.org/editor/assets/Conflict_Eng.pdf|archivedate=August 6, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coalition&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers|title=Child Soldiers: Global Report 2008|year=2008|url=http://www.childsoldiersglobalreport.org/files/country_pdfs/FINAL_2008_Global_Report.pdf|accessdate=April 12, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307015140/http://www.childsoldiersglobalreport.org/files/country_pdfs/FINAL_2008_Global_Report.pdf|archivedate=March 7, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Children in drug trades ===
Children are also used in drug trades in all regions of the world.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; Specifically, children are often trafficked into exploitation as either drug couriers or dealers, and then 'paid' in drugs, such that they become addicted and further entrapped.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; Due to the illicit nature of drug trafficking, children who are apprehended are often treated as criminals, when in reality they are often the ones in need of legal assistance.&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1 /&gt; While comprehensive worldwide statistics regarding the prevalence of this practice are unknown, several useful regional studies have been conducted. For example, the [[International Labour Organization|I.L.O]] has recently investigated the use of Afghan children in the heroin trade and child involvement in the drug trades of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=International Centre on Human Rights and Drug Policy|title=Afghan Children Ensnared in Heroin Trade with Iran|url=http://www.humanrightsanddrugs.org/category/issues/trafficking/|accessdate=March 9, 2012|date=February 16, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429014857/http://www.humanrightsanddrugs.org/category/issues/trafficking/|archivedate=April 29, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=I.L.O.|title=Brazil Children in Drug Trafficking: A Rapid Assessment|year=2002|url=http://www.dreamscanbe.org/Reasearch%20Page%20Docs/Souza%20e%20Silva%20and%20Urani%20-%20Brazil%20Children%20in%20Drug%20Trafficki.pdf|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Luke Dowdney specifically studied children in the drug trade in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; he found that children involved in the drug trades are at significantly higher risk of engaging in violence, particularly murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dowdney|first=Luke|title=Children of the Drug Trade|year=2003|publisher=Viveiros de Castro Editora Ltda|url=http://www.coav.org.br/publique/media/livroluke_eng.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205213532/http://www.coav.org.br/publique/media/livroluke_eng.pdf|archivedate=2013-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child begging ===
Forced child begging is a type of begging in which boys and girls under the age of eighteen are forced to beg through psychological and physical coercion.&lt;ref name="Delap, Emily 2009"&gt;Delap, Emily. "Begging For Change: Research findings and recommendations on forced child begging in Albania/Greece, India, and Senegal". Anti-Slavery International, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Begging is defined by the Buffalo Human Rights Law Review as "the activity of asking for money as charity on the street".&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"&gt;Cherneva, Iveta. "Human Trafficking For Begging". Buffalo Human Rights Law Review 17 (2011): 25. LexisNexis Academic: Law Reviews.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence to suggest that forced begging is one industry that children are trafficked into, with a recent [[UNICEF]] study reporting that 13% of trafficking victims in South Eastern Europe have been trafficked for the purpose of forced begging.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt; The United Nations protocol affirms that "the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall be considered 'trafficking in persons' even if this does not involve any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) of this article."&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt; With this definition the transportation of a child to an urban center for the purposes of begging constitutes trafficking regardless of whether this process was enforced by a third party or family member.&lt;ref name="Delap, Emily 2009"/&gt; The severity of this form of trafficking is starting to gain global recognition, with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), [[European Union|the European Union]], the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), and the [[United Nations]], among others, beginning to emphasize its pertinence.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt;  The European Union's Brussels Declaration on Preventing and Combating Trafficking includes child begging as one form of trafficking, stating "trafficking in human beings is an abhorrent and worrying phenomenon involving coercive sexual exploitation, labor exploitation in conditions akin to slavery, exploitation in begging and juvenile delinquency as well as domestic servitude."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belgium.iom.int/STOPConference/Conference%20Papers/brudeclaration.pdf Brussels Declaration on Preventing and Combating Trafficking] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617051511/http://www.belgium.iom.int/STOPConference/Conference%20Papers/brudeclaration.pdf |date=2012-06-17 }}, 2002,&lt;/ref&gt; This issue is especially difficult to regulate given that forced begging is often imposed by family members, with parental power leveraged over a child to ensure that begging is carried out.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt;

==== Demographics ====
By definition child begging occurs in persons younger than eighteen, though forced begging has been found by UNICEF to exist among children as young as the age of two.&lt;ref name="Delap, Emily 2009"/&gt;  Incidences of this practice have been recorded by the [[World Bank]] in South and Central Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and West Africa.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"&gt;World Bank [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTSOCIALDEVELOPMENT/Resources/244362-1239390842422/6012763-1239905793229/Human_Trafficking.pdf Social Development Notes: Conflict, Crime, and Violence], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most research, such as studies done by UNICEF, suggests that boys are much more likely than girls to be trafficked for the purposes of begging; experts presume this is because there is a greater female presence in trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2006"&gt;"Action to Prevent Child Trafficking Report". UNICEF, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In Albania, where forced begging is a common practice, seventy percent of victims are male.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt;

While concrete figures are difficult to determine, the International Labour Organization (ILO) recently reported that there are at least 600,000 children involved in forced begging.&lt;ref&gt;Craig 2010, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The problem may be much more extensive, however, with China's Ministry of Civil Affairs reporting that as many as 1.5 million children are forced into begging.&lt;ref name="Pumin, Yin 2011"&gt;Pumin, Yin. "Saving Child Panhandlers". Beijing Review 54.9 (2011). 18-19. EBSCOhost. 9 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a recent study done in Senegal by [[Human Rights Watch]] projected that a minimum of 50,000 children within the country and neighboring nations have been trafficked for the purposes of begging.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch 2010, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Begging is often the primary source of income for street children in a number of countries, with a current study conducted by UNICEF finding that 45.7% of children who work on the streets of Zimbabwe engaged in begging, though there is no way of knowing whether it was through forced means.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"&gt;UNICEF. "[http://www.unicef.org/evaldatabase/files/ZIM_01-805.pdf Study On Street Children In Zimbabwe]" (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Gang networks involving forced begging have been found to occur in populations of 500 or greater.&lt;ref name="Burke, Jason 2011"&gt;Burke, Jason, and Saad Hammadi. "Bangladesh Arrest Uncovers Evidence of Children Forced to Beg". The Guardian [London] 9 Jan. 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption===
Children may be trafficked for the purposes of adoption, particularly international adoption.  Children are sourced from orphanages or kidnapped, or parents may be tricked, cajoled or coerced into relinquishing custody. {{Source needed|date=January 2018}}  Disreputable international adoption agencies then arrange international adoptions, charging high fees to prospective adoptive parents.  The [[Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Cooperation in regard to Intercountry Adoption]] is an international agreement designed to protect children from such exploitation and to assist in preventing such illegal intercountry adoptions.

==== Causes ====

===== Economic factors =====
Forced begging is a profitable practice in which exploiters are motivated by economic incentives. The business structures of major rings of children trafficked for the purpose of begging have been examined as comparable to a medium-size business enterprise.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt; In the most severe cases networks of children forced to beg may generate $30–40,000 USD for the profiteer.&lt;ref&gt;Delap 2009, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Though family networks are not nearly as extensive, a study conducted in Albania showed that a family with multiple children begging can earn up to fifteen euros a day, an amount greater than the average national teacher salary.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt; Anti-Slavery International asserts that because this income is relatively high many families believe it is the best option available given the lack of existing [[Capability approach|capabilities]]. Capability deprivation, meaning the routine absence of adequate resources that serve in facilitating opportunities, may account for cross-generational begging practices within families.&lt;ref&gt;Delap 2009, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; UNICEF studies have found that begging is especially prevalent among families in which parents are incapacitated in some way, leading children to be the sole providers.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

===== Political factors =====
According to the World Bank forced begging is most commonly found in the Middle East and countries of West Africa, where laws prohibiting begging are scarce and heavy regulation of trafficking absent.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"/&gt; In Zimbabwe, where child begging is especially prominent, the United Nations has indicated many contradictions between the Labour Act of Zimbabwe and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt; Many nations, such as Indonesia, have laws against begging on the books, but the repercussions for such entail temporary detainment and eventual release back onto the streets, which does little to combat the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Kevin. "A Generation's Future Goes Begging". The Washington Post [Jakarta, Indonesia] 7 Sept. 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Cultural factors =====
There are several cultural factors that support begging. In Europe begging is found in a number of minority cultures, especially popular within Roma and nomadic communities.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt; In Turkey familial networks of beggars have been documented across three generations, making it deeply ingrained within their survival schemas.&lt;ref name="Craig, Gary 2010"&gt;Craig, Gary. "Child Slavery Now". Portland: The Policy Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that while these may be culturally rooted practices, juvenile begging by way of familial pressure still falls under the realm of forced begging.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt; The transport of children, even one's own, for the purposes of exploitation through begging is a form of trafficking outlined by the United Nations.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt;

Another cultural practice is the resolution of familial debts through the kidnapping and exploitation of one of their children.&lt;ref&gt;Sidner, Sarah.

UNICEF has found that children who are forced to beg by third parties are often removed from their families, surrender the majority of their income to their exploiter, endure unsafe work and living conditions, and are at times maimed to increase profits.&lt;ref name="Delap, Emily 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2006"/&gt; The process of [[Mutilation|maiming]], popularized by the film ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'', is common given that according to the Buffalo Human Rights Law Review children with apparent special needs often make upwards of three times as much as other children who beg.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt; In addition to inflictions such as blindness and loss of limbs, other physical abuses for the purposes of heightening profits include pouring chili pepper on a child's tongue to give the appearance of impeded speech, the use of opium to elicit cries, and administering forced injections of drugs that will increase a child's energy and alertness.&lt;ref name="Delap, Emily 2009"/&gt; Testimonies against trafficking ring gang leaders have discussed the detainment of individuals in small cells devoid of food, water, and light to make victims weak and feeble, and thus more likely to elicit donations.&lt;ref name="Burke, Jason 2011"/&gt;

The conditions in which begging takes place commonly expose children to further physical and verbal abuse, including sexual victimization and police brutality.&lt;ref name="Delap, Emily 2009"/&gt; Research completed by Human Rights Watch revealed that when begging hours are completed for the day children often do not have proper shelter, adequate food, or access to healthcare where they reside.&lt;ref name="Wells 2010"&gt;Wells, Matthew. "Off the Backs of the Children: Forced Begging and Other Abuses Against Talibes in Senegal". New York, New York: Human Rights Watch, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many of the gangs which run networks of forced begging have heavy drug involvement, thus the children under their control are often turned into drug addicts in order for them to become further reliant on their exploiters.&lt;ref name="Delap, Emily 2009"/&gt;

==== Long-term implications ====
Studies have shown that children forced into begging primarily receive little to no education, with upwards of sixteen hours a day dedicated to time on the streets.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt; With education being a leading method in escaping poverty child beggars have been shown to engage in a cyclical process of continuing this practice cross-generationally.&lt;ref name="Delap, Emily 2009"/&gt; Interviews conducted by UNICEF show that children who beg have little hope for the future and do not believe their circumstances will improve.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt; Children who work on the streets typically have little or no knowledge of their rights, leaving them especially susceptible to exploitation both as juveniles and later as adults.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt; Children who beg have also been found by UNICEF to have much higher instances of HIV-infection due to lack of awareness and supervision on the streets.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

==== Solutions ====

===== International action =====
A victim-centered human rights approach to combating trafficking has been internationally renowned as the best possible strategy when addressing this issue, with recourse focusing on punishing the exploiter and rehabilitating the child.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt; Some countries who emphasize this method include the United States, with the [[Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000|U.S. Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000]] affirming "victims of severe forms of trafficking should not be inappropriately incarcerated, fined, or otherwise penalized solely for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked."&lt;ref name="TVPA 2000"&gt;U.S. Trafficking Victims Protection Act 2000, p.1468.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other supported methods, such as those outlined by the Buffalo Human Rights Center, include relying on three Ps: protection, prosecution, and prevention.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt; Protection starts with enforcing strict measures on the matters of both trafficking and begging. For many nations the first step is the criminalization of begging and trafficking.&lt;ref name="Craig, Gary 2010"/&gt; Prosecution should be instituted in the form of greater legal ramifications for traffickers, with punishment focused on the exploiter rather than the exploited.&lt;ref name="TVPA 2000"/&gt; This becomes difficult with respect to victims of familial trafficking, considering this would require changes in care placement and strict monitoring of each displaced child's welfare.&lt;ref name="Delap, Emily 2009"/&gt; Many organizations affirm that prevention begins with discouraging donations and improving services so that children, and families as a whole, have greater capabilities.&lt;ref name="Wells 2010"/&gt; Though well-intentioned, by giving child beggars money, individuals only make this practice more profitable, and soon these funds find their way into the hands of the child's abuser.&lt;ref name="Wells 2010"/&gt;

===== Government response =====
In Senegal, where the abuses against  [[talibes]] are extensive, there have been several initiatives with the help of [[World Bank|the World Bank]] to put an end this exploitation. First, there is intervention on a community level with education on the validity of some of these Quranic institutions provided to rural villages that typically send their children there. This is supplemented by improved regulation of schools within the nation to ensure that they remain places of education, followed by a greater enforcement of preexisting laws banning trafficking and exploitative begging. Finally, rehabilitation services have been provided with the help of [[Civil Society Organization|CSOs]] to recovered children to provide them with the capabilities they have been denied.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"/&gt;

In Zimbabwe policy has adapted to ensure the safety of all persons under the age of sixteen with the Children's Protection and Adoption Act, however, the government admits that a lack of resources and capital play a critical role in inadequate enforcement.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

In Bangladesh, where there are an estimated 700,000 beggars, a law passed in 2009 banning the practice, though officials report some trouble with enforcement.&lt;ref name="Burke, Jason 2011"/&gt;

In China, the Ministry of Public Security has established a department that solely focuses on child trafficking. Recently the department has instituted a hotline where the public dials 110 to report suspected incidences of forced begging, which law enforcement officials are expected to investigate further. The police are trained to take the children into custody if a blood relationship with their guardian cannot be established, and educate parents on the illegality and dangers of begging if they are those responsible for the child's action. This policy instituted in April 2009 has since led to the recovery of 9,300 children.&lt;ref name="Pumin, Yin 2011"/&gt;

===== NGO initiatives =====
Many NGOs have initiated movements focusing on informing the public on the dangers of donations. As recently reported by UNICEF  "certain behaviors, such as giving money to child beggars can also indirectly motivate traffickers and controller to demand children."&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2006"/&gt; The Mirror Foundation's Stop Child Begging Project of Thailand is one such organization that emphasizes eliminating the demand. Their initiatives are focused on educating passersby on the forced begging of trafficked Cambodians within their country to decrease the likelihood of donations.&lt;ref&gt;humantrafficking.org, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Other methods =====
In China, where the kidnapping and forced begging of children has been routinely documented, a multi-media movement has begun.&lt;ref name="Pumin, Yin 2011"/&gt; Here, blogs are utilized to publicize over 3,000 photos of children whose families believe have been abducted for the purpose of begging, with hundreds of thousands of followers who remain on the look out for these children in major urban centers. This campaign has enabled at least six children to be recovered and reunited with their families.&lt;ref name="Pumin, Yin 2011"/&gt;

In instances where begging is religiously sanctioned it has been suggested by [[USAID|USAid]] that religious leaders should outwardly condemn this practice. For talibes religious leaders have been asked to take a stance against begging using passages cited from the Quran, such as "Except paradise, you should not beg anything for the sake of Allah" (8:23), which would help strip the practice of its religious foundation.&lt;ref&gt;"Study on the Practice of Trafficking in Persons in Senegal". USAid (2004). United States Agency For International Development.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, during the time of president Clinton - a former president of the United States-, he took the responsibility of providing protection against child abuse through Internet Service providers (ISP) that can help the law enforcement tracking any suspicious activities including child pornography (McCabe, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;247).&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, K.A. (2008). The role of internet providers in cases of child pornography and	child protection. Social Science Computer Review, 26(2), 247-251.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child exchange ===
In China, in response to adult starvation, some children were exchanged, killed, and eaten. According to Robyn Meredith, "peasants [in the People's Republic of China (possibly in ''ca.'' B.C.770)] turned into skeletons. The nation's farmers, including the residents of Xiaogang,&amp;nbsp;.... [among some] starving families[,] resorted to a practice called ''易子而食'' [meaning "exchanging children to eat"]:... they traded a child for a neighbor's child, then killed and ate the skinny youngster, with the sickening knowledge that their neighbors were devouring their own."&lt;ref&gt;Meredith, Robyn, ''The Elephant and the Dragon: The Rise of India and China and What It Means For All of Us'' (N.Y.: W. W. Norton, 1st ed., hardcover 2007 ({{ISBN|978-0-393-06236-6}})), p.&amp;nbsp;19 &amp; nn.&amp;nbsp;10 &amp; 11 (People's Republic of China &amp; ''ca.'' 1958 per p.&amp;nbsp;18) ("a number of Chinese and Western scholars have documented starvation and cannibalism during Mao's Great Leap Forward, but these accounts of what happened in China's countryside are taken from" Becker, Jasper, ''Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine'' (N.Y.: Free Press, 1996), per ''The Elephant and the Dragon'', ''id.'', p.&amp;nbsp;19 n.&amp;nbsp;11).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Peasant]]s, traditionally farmers who might be slaves, serfs, or free}}{{Efn|[[Xiaogang (disambiguation)]], one of several places in China}}{{Efn|[[Great Leap Forward]], a campaign under Mao Zedong to quickly move China from being agrarian to industrializing and collectivizing to become communist}}

=== Sales motivated by cash ===
In [[ancient Rome]], according to Keith Bradley, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] wrote that "there were indigent parents selling their children because they needed the cash."&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Keith, ''Slavery and Society at Rome'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pbk. 1994 ({{ISBN|0-521-37887-7}})), p.&amp;nbsp;37 (book on "central period of Roman history", ''ca.'' 200 B.C. to ''ca.'' A.D. 200) (author prof. classics, [[University of Victoria|Univ. of Victoria]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary Nepal, parents of poor families sell their children to [[orphanage]]s (or sometimes simply hand them over without any payment). The orphanage then misrepresent them as "orphans", ensuring an income for the orphanages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/Unreported-World/episode-guide|title=Unreported World|work=Channel 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/dateline/story/transcript/id/601840/n/Nepal-s-Orphan-Trade|title=Nepal's Orphan Trade|work=News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms ==
In general, child trafficking takes place in three stages: recruitment, movement, and exploitation.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="United Nations, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 2002"/&gt; Recruitment occurs when a child is approached by a recruiter, or in some cases, directly approaches a recruiter themselves.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; Recruitment is initiated in many different ways: adolescents may be under pressure to contribute to their families, children may be kidnapped or abducted into trafficking, or families may be trafficked together.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; Then, movement will occur - locally, regionally, and/or internationally - through a variety of transportation types, including by car, train, boat, or foot.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1" /&gt; Ultimately, the final goal of child trafficking is exploitation, whereby traffickers use the services of children to garner illegal profit.&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1 /&gt; Exploitation can take place in a variety of forms, including forced labor, sexual exploitation, and child begging, among other practices.

=== Supply and demand framework ===
Child trafficking is often conceptualized using the economic model of [[supply and demand]].&lt;ref name="United Nations, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feingold|first=David A.|title=Human Trafficking|journal=Foreign Policy|year=2005|volume=150|jstor=30048506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, those who are trafficked constitute the "supply", while the traffickers, and all those who profit from the exploitation, provide the "demand".&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; Two types of demand are defined: consumer demand and derived demand. Consumer demand is generated by people who actively or passively buy the products or services of trafficked labor.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; An example of this would be a tourist purchasing a T-shirt that has been made by a trafficked child. Derived demand, on the other hand, is generated by people who directly profit from the practice of trafficking, such as pimps or corrupt factory owners.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; Scholar Kevin Bales has extensively studied the application of this economic framework to instances of human trafficking; he contends that it is central to an accurate understanding of how trafficking is initiated and sustained.&lt;ref name=Bales&gt;{{cite book|last=Bales|first=Kevin|title=Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global Economy|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bales, along with scholars Elizabeth M. Wheaton, Edward J. Schauer, and Thomas V. Galli, have asserted that national governments should more actively implement policies that reduce both types of demand, thus working towards the elimination of trafficking.&lt;ref name="United States Department of State 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=United States Department of State|title=Trafficking in Persons Report|year=2011|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/164452.pdf|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wheaton|first=Elizabeth M.|author2=Edward J.

Galli|title=Economics of Human Trafficking|journal=International Migration|year=2010|volume=48|issue=4|url=http://nfsacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wheaton-Economics-of-Human-Trafficking.pdf|accessdate=April 12, 2012|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x|pages=114–41|pmid=20645472}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social mechanisms ===
Various international organizations, including the [[International Labour Organization]] and the [[United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking]] have linked child trafficking to poverty: Living in poverty has been found to increase children's vulnerability to trafficking.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNESCO|title=Poverty, Gender, and Human Trafficking in Sub-Saharan Africa: Rethinking Best Practices in Migration Management|year=2005|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001432/143227e.pdf|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gozdziak 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gozdziak|first=Elzbieta M.|journal=Anthropological Quarterly|year=2008|volume=81|issue=4|title=On Challenges, Dilemmas, and Opportunities in Studying Trafficked Children|jstor=25488246}}{{paywall|via=[[Fondren Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, poverty is only one of many social "risk factors" that can lead to trafficking. As [[UNICEF]] and the [[World Bank]] note, "Often children experience several risk factors at the same time, and one of them may act as a trigger that sets the trafficking event in motion. This is sometimes called 'poverty plus,' a situation in which poverty does not by itself lead to a person being trafficked, but where a 'plus' factor such as illness combines with poverty to increase vulnerability."&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=The World Bank|title=Human Trafficking: A Brief Overview|journal=Social Development Notes: Conflict, Crime, and Violence|date=December 2009|issue=122|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTSOCIALDEVELOPMENT/Resources/244362-1239390842422/6012763-1239905793229/Human_Trafficking.pdf|accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNICEF]], [[United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking|UN.GIFT]] and several scholars, including Una Murray and Mike Dottridge, also contend that an accurate understanding of child trafficking must incorporate an analysis of gender inequality.&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dott&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dottridge|first=Mike|title=Trafficking in Children in West and Central Africa|journal=Gender and Development|year=2002|volume=10|series=1|pages=38–42|jstor=4030680|doi=10.1080/13552070215890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Una|title=Good Practices: Gender Mainstreaming in Actions Against Child Labor|year=2003|publisher=International Labour Organization|location=Geneva}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, in many countries, girls are at a higher risk of being trafficked, particularly into sexual exploitation.&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dott /&gt; In addition, these international agencies and scholars contend that giving women and men an equal voice in anti-trafficking policy is critical to reducing the incidence of child trafficking.&lt;ref name=Dott /&gt;&lt;ref name=Murray /&gt;

Studies throughout Europe have identified risks that make children vulnerable to exploitation that are also causes and contributing factors of child trafficking. These include social and economic marginalisation, dysfunctional family backgrounds, experiences of neglect, abuse or violence within the family or in institutions, exploitative relationships, gender-based violence and discrimination, experiences of living or working on the streets, precarious and irregular migration situations, aspirations to work and to earn money and limited opportunities to enter or remain in school, vocational training or regular employment. As the efforts of national governments to improve social safety nets can lessen many of these risks, child trafficking is considered not only a result of criminal activities but also as indicating weaknesses in the national government's ability to effectively safeguard children’s rights to a safe and healthy development.&lt;ref&gt;CARDET, Defence for Children International – Italy et al., IMPACT, Improving Monitoring and Protection Systems Against Child Trafficking and Exploitation, Transnational Analysis, 2013, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund Innocenti Research Centre (2008), [http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/iwp_2008_05.%20pdf Young People’s Voices on Child Trafficking: Experiences from South Eastern Europe, Innocenti Working Paper No. IWP-2008-05]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Florence&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund Innocenti Research Centre (2008), Child Trafficking in Europe, A Broad Vision to Put Children First, Innocenti Insight, Florence, pp. 12-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Save the Children (2007), Children Speak Out, Trafficking risk and resilience in Southeast Europe, Regional Report, pp. 20-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identification ==
The complex definition of child trafficking and the differences in national laws and interpretations makes the identification of child victims of trafficking challenging. For example, the European debate on child trafficking lacks consensus on how child trafficking is to be distinguished from other contexts of exploitation, from [[social dumping]] of migrants, the sale of children and the smuggling of migrants.&lt;ref&gt;CARDET, Defence for Children International – Italy et al., IMPACT, Improving Monitoring and Protection Systems Against Child Trafficking and Exploitation, Transnational Analysis, 2013, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund Innocenti Research Centre, Child Trafficking in the Nordic Countries, Rethinking strategies and national responses, A Technical Report, 2012, pp. 34-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a potential victim has come into contact with state authorities, identifying the child as a victim of trafficking takes time. The process often benefits from a thorough understanding of the child’s story. For a child who is in trouble with the law, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers and officers determine if the child is actually a victim of a crime herself, such as exploitation, abuse, or trafficking. For a child in an administrative process, such as an asylum procedure, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers to detect cases of trafficking. Children may be hesitant to share their complete stories with authorities and appointed child welfare professionals. Some service providers have found that establishing trust and a stable relationship with the child encourages increased disclosure of experiences of exploitation and trafficking that might otherwise not be detected. The trust building process can include granting assistance and support services to ensure safety, well-being and development.&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Trafficking in Human Beings: Identification of Potential and Presumed Victims, A Community Policing Approach, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norway: Coordination Unit for Victims of Trafficking, Guide to Identification of Possible Victims of Trafficking, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sweden: Handbook for the identification of child victims of trafficking developed by National Board of Health and Welfare with UNICEF Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denmark: Guidelines for identification of victims of trafficking developed by the Danish Centre against Trafficking in Human Beings.&lt;/ref&gt;

Identified victims of child trafficking are entitled to special safeguards that all child victims of crimes are entitled to under international law. These safeguards include the right to [[guardianship]], legal assistance and representation, safety and protection, support for physical and psychological recovery and [[social integration|social reintegration]], regularisation of [[Immigration|immigration status]], the right to compensation, and the right to act as a party, or plaintiff, in criminal proceedings. An important safeguard for trafficked children who have been exploited in illegal or criminal activities is the ‘non-punishment clause’. It means that child victims of criminal offences, including human trafficking, are to be protected from sanctions or prosecution for acts that they committed in relation to their situation as victims.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund, Guidelines on the Protection of Child Victims of Trafficking, UNICEF Technical Notes, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Economic and Social Council, Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime, Economic and Social Council Resolution 2005/20, 22 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles 19 and 32-36 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child prohibits the exploitation of children in any form and in any context. Any child who is exposed to violence, exploitation or abuse can be considered a victim of crime and enjoys the correlated rights and entitlements, including access to assistance, protection and support, services for recovery and rehabilitation, access to justice, with due procedural safeguards in any related legal or administrative proceedings. Children at risk of exploitation have to be identified and recognised as being at risk. This implies that they have a right to assistance and support in order to prevent their exploitation or any other harm resulting from the risks. Considering the difficulties of identifying children who have been trafficked and the broad protection against all forms and contexts of exploitation afforded under the Convention, a child rights-based approach prioritises the identification of child victims of exploitation or other crime and children at risk. Whether or not exploitation takes place in a context of trafficking is of subordinate relevance for the child rights and protection context. It may interest primarily the law enforcement investigations and the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;CARDET, Defence for Children International – Italy et al., IMPACT, Improving Monitoring and Protection Systems Against Child Trafficking and Exploitation, Transnational Analysis, 2013, pp. 15-19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund Innocenti Research Centre, Child Trafficking in the Nordic Countries, Rethinking strategies and national responses, A Technical Report, 2012, pp. 34-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
It is difficult to obtain reliable estimates concerning the number of children trafficked each year, primarily due to the covert and criminal nature of this practice.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gozdziak 2008"/&gt; It often takes years to gather and compile estimates regarding child trafficking and, as a result, data can seem both inadequate and outdated.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; This process of gathering data is only complicated by the fact that very few countries publish national estimates of child trafficking.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; As a result, the available statistics are widely thought to underestimate the actual scope of the problem.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;

=== Worldwide ===
Trafficking of children has been documented in every region of the world.&lt;ref name="United Nations 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inter-Agency Coordination Group Against Trafficking in Persons (ICAT)|title=An Analytical Review 10 Years on from the Adoption of the UN Trafficking in Persons Protocol|year=2010|url=http://www.unicef.org/protection/ICAT_Backgound_Paper.pdf|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A widely used figure regarding the prevalence of this practice is provided by the [[International Labour Organization]], which estimates that 1.2 million children are trafficked each year; this estimate includes cross-border and internal trafficking.&lt;ref name="I.L.O. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=I.L.O.|title=Every Child Counts: New Global Estimates on Child Labour|year=2002|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipecinfo/product/viewProduct.do?productId=742|accessdate=February 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regional ===
Regionally, the [[International Labour Organization]] has provided the following estimates for trafficking of children by region per year:&lt;ref name="I.L.O. 2002"/&gt;
* Asia/Pacific: 250,000 children
* Latin America &amp; the Caribbean: 550,000 children
* Africa: 200,000 children
* Transition economies: 200,000 children
* Developed/industrialized economies: unknown

As the numbers above indicate, child trafficking occurs the most frequently in Latin America and the Caribbean. Child trafficking is also the most prevalent in developing countries, though it does occur in developed and industrialized economies as well.&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="United States Department of State 2011"/&gt; Notably, the [[United States Department of State]] publishes an annual "Trafficking in Persons" report which provides ample data regarding the prevalence of human and child trafficking in the majority of countries.&lt;ref name="United States Department of State 2011"/&gt;  The University of Pennsylvania School of Social Work released a study that estimated as many as 300,000 American youth may be at risk of commercial sexual exploitation at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sp2.upenn.edu/~restes/CSEC_Files/Exec_Sum_020220.pdf |title=SP2.upenn.edu |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002000344/http://www.sp2.upenn.edu/~restes/CSEC_Files/Exec_Sum_020220.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History (England)===
According to anthropologist Samuel Pyeatt Menefee, in the late 17th and 18th centuries, in Britain, parents in poverty "sold their children (actually, their children's services, but to all intents and purposes their persons as well)".&lt;ref&gt;Menefee, Samuel Pyeatt, ''Wives for Sale: An Ethnographic Study of British Popular Divorce'' (N.Y.: St. Martin's Press, 1981 ({{ISBN|0-312-88629-2}})), p. 163 and see pp. 163–165 and p. 133 n. 4 for a quotation from ''Jackson's Oxford Journal'' (Oxford, Oxfordshire), Aug. 12, 1797, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Sale motivations were more economic than for wife sales&lt;ref name="WivesForSale-p165"&gt;Menefee, Samuel Pyeatt, ''Wives for Sale'', ''id.'', p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; and prices, drawing from limited data, "appear to have been fairly high".&lt;ref&gt;Menefee, Samuel Pyeatt, ''Wives for Sale'', ''id.'', p. 165 &amp; n. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the boys sold were climbing boys for chimney sweeps until they were no longer small enough.&lt;ref&gt;Menefee, Samuel Pyeatt, ''Wives for Sale'', ''op. cit.'', p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution was another reason for selling a child, usually a girl.One sale was of a niece; another was the sale by a man of the daughter of a woman domestic partner who also ran his business. Some children were stolen and then sold.&lt;ref name="WivesForSale-p164"&gt;Menefee, Samuel Pyeatt, ''Wives for Sale'', ''id.'', pp. 164–165 &amp; nn. 19 &amp; 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking|UN.GIFT]], child trafficking has the most significant impact on trafficked children and their families.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=UN.GIFT&gt;{{cite journal|last=UN.GIFT|title=An Introduction to Human Trafficking: Vulnerability, Impact, and Action|journal=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|year=2008|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/human-trafficking/An_Introduction_to_Human_Trafficking_-_Background_Paper.pdf|accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, trafficking can result in the death or permanent injury of the trafficked child.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; This can stem from a dangerous "movement" stage of trafficking or from specific aspects of the "exploitation" stage, such as hazardous working conditions. Moreover, trafficked children are often denied access to healthcare, effectively increasing their chances of serious injury and death.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; Trafficked children are also often subject to domestic violence; they may be beaten or starved in order to ensure obedience.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;  In addition, these children frequently encounter substance abuse; they may be given drugs as "payment" or to ensure that they become addicted and thus dependent on their trafficker(s).&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; As opposed to many other forms of crime, the trauma experienced by children who are trafficked is often prolonged and repeated, leading to severe psychological impacts.&lt;ref name=UN.GIFT /&gt; [[United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking|UN.GIFT]] reports that trafficked children often suffer from depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, among other conditions.&lt;ref name=UN.GIFT /&gt;

Effects on families are also severe. Some families believe that sending or allowing their children to relocate in order to find work will bring in additional income, while in reality many families will never see their trafficked children again.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; In addition, [[United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking|UN.GIFT]] has found that certain forms of trafficking, particularly sexual exploitation in girls, bring "shame" to families.&lt;ref name=UN.GIFT /&gt;  Thus, in certain cases, children who are able to escape trafficking may return to their families only to find that they are rejected and ostracized.&lt;ref name=UN.GIFT /&gt;

=== Communities ===
Child trafficking has also been shown to have a major effect on communities. If multiple children in a community are trafficked, it can result in the entire community being corrupted, and thus devastated, by trafficking.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; Social development efforts are hindered, as trafficked children's educations are cut short.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; As a result of this lack of education, children who escape trafficking may be less able to secure employment later in life.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; In addition, trafficked girls face special obstacles, in that their prospects for marriage might be diminished if the community becomes aware that they have been trafficked, particularly into sexual exploitation.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;

=== Nations ===
On a national level, economic development is severely hindered by the lack of education of trafficked children; this results in a major loss of potentially productive future workers.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=UN.GIFT /&gt; Children who are able to successfully return to their families often pose a significant financial burden, due to their lack of education, and the illnesses and injuries they may have incurred during trafficking work.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; There are major costs associated with the rehabilitation of these trafficked children, so that they are able to successfully participate in their communities.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; Furthermore, the persistence of child trafficking indicates the presence of sustained criminal activity and criminal networks, which, in most cases, are also associated with drugs and violence.&lt;ref name=UN.GIFT /&gt; As a result, [[United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking|UN.GIFT]] has cited child trafficking as a significant indicator of national and global security threats.&lt;ref name=UN.GIFT /&gt;

== Proposed solutions ==
Solutions to child trafficking, or "anti-trafficking actions", can be roughly classified into four categories:&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=I.L.O |last2=UNICEF |last3=UN.GIFT|title=Training Manual to Fight Child Trafficking in Children for Labour, Sexual and Other Forms of Exploitation - Textbook 2: Action Against Child Trafficking at Policy and Outreach Levels|year=2009|url=http://www.unicef.org/protection/CP_Trg_Manual_Textbook_2.pdf|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Broad protection: "To prevent children and former victims from being (re)trafficked"
* Prevention: "Of the crime of child trafficking and the exploitation that is its end result"
* Law enforcement: "In particular within a labour context and relating to labour laws and regulations"
* Protection: "all steps towards the redress of their grievance, rehabilitation and helping to establish her/him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2065674/Child_Trafficking_Problems_and_Solutions|title=Child Trafficking: Problems and Solutions|author=Bianca Daw|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broad protection actions are geared towards children who could potentially be trafficked, and include raising awareness about child trafficking, particularly in vulnerable communities.&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2 /&gt; This type of outreach also includes policies geared towards improving the economic statuses of vulnerable families, so that reasonable alternatives are available to them, other than sending their children to work.&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2 /&gt; Examples of this include increasing employment opportunities for adults and [[conditional cash transfer]] programs. Another major broad protection program that has been readily endorsed by [[United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking|UN.GIFT]], the [[International Labour Organization|I.L.O]], and [[UNICEF]] involves facilitating gender equality, specifically by enhancing both boys' and girls' access to affordable, quality education.&lt;ref name=UN.GIFT /&gt;&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pinheiro|first=Paulo Sergio|title=World Report on Violence against Children|year=2006|
url=https://www.unicef.org/violencestudy/reports/SG_violencestudy_en.pdf |accessdate=February 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way to raise awareness for child trafficking is by communities from all over the world dedicating a week to this situation. Observing the 2012 Human Trafficking Awareness Day in the US, and wider world. Community groups along with police enforcements are collaborating to organize events as well as in depth information sessions and support groups for the victims. The events held by communities could include films, guest speakers, booths, and many more things that can help people understand the seriousness of this issue. The ICE (Human Trafficking) has a help line for victims as well as conducts awareness in the U.S.A communities through the ICE In Plain Sight Campaign.

Preventative actions are more focused on addressing the actual practice of child trafficking, specifically by implementing legal frameworks that are aimed to both deter and prosecute traffickers.&lt;ref name="United Nations, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2 /&gt; This involves the adoption and implementation of the [[International Labour Organization|International Labour Organization's]] [[international labour standards]], as well as the development of safe and legal migration practices.&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2 /&gt;

Law enforcement refers to the actual prosecution of traffickers; [[UNICEF]] maintains that successful prosecution of child traffickers is the surest way to send a message that child trafficking will not be tolerated.&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2 /&gt; Traffickers can be "caught" at any one of the three steps of trafficking: recruitment, movement, and/or exploitation; anti-trafficking laws as well as [[child labour]] laws must then be appropriately enforced and having them properly implemented. The development of grassroots surveillance systems has also been suggested by [[UNICEF]] which would enable communities to immediately report signs of child trafficking to legal authorities.&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2 /&gt;Protection begins first with victim identification; child trafficking laws must specifically and appropriately define what constitutes a "trafficking victim".&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2" /&gt; Legal processes must then be in place for removing children from trafficking situations, and returning them either to their families or other appropriate settings.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2" /&gt; Victims should also be provided with individualized and supportive physical and [[Psychological trauma|psychological]] rehabilitation in order to establish him or her self. This recuperation can take quite a length of time but, with the individual having the correct support, they can work towards a functional life.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2" /&gt; Finally, steps should be taken to avoid "double victimization" - in other words, to ensure that formerly trafficked children are treated as victims, and not as criminals.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2" /&gt; An example of "double victimization" would be a child who was illegally trafficked into sexual exploitation in the United States, and then, once free from trafficking, is prosecuted for being an illegal migrant. The End Trafficking Project is the initiative to raise awareness about child trafficking and help people take action to protect children. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicefusa.org/mission/protect/trafficking|title=Child Trafficking|work=UNICEF USA|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UNICEF has come up with ways to help children from child exploitation and the risk factors that need to be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicefusa.org/mission/protect/trafficking|title=Child Trafficking|work=UNICEF USA|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

* Helping parents provide a living wage, so the children won't have to support the family
* Lobbying governments and others to develop laws and strengthen child protection systems to prevent violence and abuse
* Supporting the training of professionals working with children,and police and border officials to help stop trafficking.
* Working with communities and organizations to change societal norms that make children more vulnerable to exploitation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7409">The '''Violence Initiative''' was a proposal for research into reducing violence in [[United States|American]] [[inner city|inner cities]], first announced on February 11, 1992 at a meeting of the [[National Mental Health Advisory Council]] by psychiatrist [[Frederick K. Goodwin]], then director of the [[Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration]]. It was initially proposed as a large-scale program of research into inner-city violence, with the intent of identifying children and youth believed to be biologically or genetically pre-disposed to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&amp;d=cs19951010-01.2.11&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN------|title='Violence Initiative' part of fatal legacy|last=McCarthy|first=Timothy|date=10 October 1995|work=Columbia Daily Spectator|access-date=2018-01-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodwin further suggested that future research possibilities might include interventions and targeted treatments in order to divert these youth from possible future violence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1992/03/01/science-and-sensitivity/285e7541-3b66-48c4-9cc9-55fb37d013f9/|title=Science and Sensitivity|last=Rensberger|first=Boyce|date=1992-03-01|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-01-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal drew public controversy after portions of Goodwin's speech which compared inner-city youth to [[primate]]s in the [[jungle]] were leaked publicly.&lt;ref name=Wright95&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Wright|first=Robert|date=1995-03-13|title=The Biology of Violence|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1995/03/13/the-biology-of-violence|magazine=New Yorker|page=68|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remarks were initially publicized by [[Peter Breggin]], an outspoken opponent of [[psychiatric medication]] and [[Genetics of aggression|biological explanations of crime]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1994/nov/violencegenesand446|title=Violence, Genes, and Prejudice|last=|first=|date=|work=Discover Magazine|access-date=2018-01-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1992/07/29/science-or-social-control/928d795e-6c3f-4fd7-988a-2a01b1093e78/|title=Science or Social Control?|last=Gilliam|first=Dorothy|date=1992-07-29|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-01-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodwin first apologized for the primate remarks in an interview on February 21, calling them "insensitive and careless."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/22/us/federal-official-apologizes-for-remarks-on-inner-cities.html|title=Federal Official Apologizes For Remarks on Inner Cities|last=Hilts|first=Philip J.|date=1992-02-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned from his position on February 27, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/28/us/health-official-quits-after-harsh-criticism.html|title=Health Official Quits After Harsh Criticism|date=1992-02-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further controversy arose when Breggin drew a connection between the Violence Initiative and Goodwin's earlier research into the use of psychiatric drugs as a means of controlling violent behavior, ultimately suggesting that the Violence Initiative would result in widespread use of psychiatric drugs to control the behavior of inner-city minority youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/18/opinion/l-us-hasn-t-given-up-linking-genes-to-crime-153192.html|title=Opinion: U.S. Hasn't Given Up Linking Genes to Crime|last=Breggin|first=Peter|date=1992-09-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Wright|1995|p=69}} Critics denounced the proposal as racist and called for it to be cancelled.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=6pcR4buMC00C&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=%22violence+initiative%22+goodwin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oXKiQJGqon&amp;sig=nlY8JR-AmYmELmPiVlAEr8TNAEM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqjKqtvM3YAhVD54MKHUpIC3o4ChDoAQgmMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22violence%20initiative%22%20goodwin&amp;f=false|title=Family Bonds: Genealogies of Race and Gender|last=Feder|first=Ellen K.|date=2007-08-06|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780198042976|location=|pages=78|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the proposal countered that the proposal had been a legitimate research topic, and had become a victim of "[[political correctness]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Primate comparison ==
Goodwin's controversial remarks drew a direct comparison between inner-city youth and male monkeys in the wild:

{{cquote|If you look, for example, at male monkeys, especially in the wild, roughly half of them survive to adulthood. The other half die by violence. That is the natural way it is for males, to knock each other off and in fact, there are some interesting evolutionary implications of that because the same hyperaggressive monkeys who kill each other are also hypersexual, so they copulate more to offset the fact that more of them are dying.

Now, one could say that if some of the loss of social structure in this society, and particularly within the high impact inner-city areas, has removed some of the civilizing evolutionary things that we have built up and that may be it isn't just the careless use of the word when people call certain areas of certain cities jungles, that we may have gone back to what might be more natural, without all the social controls that we have imposed upon ourselves as a civilization over thousands of years in our evolution.&lt;ref name=randall&gt;{{cite web|title =Violence as a Public Health Issue|last=Randall|first=Vernellia R.|url = http://academic.udayton.edu/health/05bioethics/slavery04.htm | accessdate = 2008-05-31| publisher = academic.udayton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These remarks were described as "rambling" by the ''[[Washington Post]]'' during the initial controversy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In a 1995 article, the ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' characterized his logic as "obscure" and "not entirely clear"; the same article reported Goodwin stating that he had made the remarks "impromptu - and after a wholly sleepless night".&lt;ref name=Wright95 /&gt;

The comparison of inner-city youth to primates, accompanied by the use of the word "jungle", was widely viewed as racist.&lt;ref name="Wright95" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Writer [[Tom Wolfe]], though sympathetic to Goodwin's argument, stated in his 1996 essay "Sorry, But Your Soul Just Died", that this "may have been the stupidest single word uttered by an American public official in the year 1992".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Sorry, But Your Soul Just Died| last = Wolfe| first = Tom| url = http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles/WolfeSoulDied.php| publisher = OrthodoxyToday.org| accessdate = 2008-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8624">'''1st Lt. Walter Haut''' (June 3, 1922 – December 15, 2005) was the [[public information officer]] (PIO) at the 509th Bomb Group based in [[Roswell, New Mexico]] during 1947.  Early on July 8, 1947 he was ordered by the base commander, [[William H. Blanchard|Colonel William Blanchard]], to draft a [[press release]] to the public, announcing that the [[United States Army Air Forces]] had recovered a crashed "[[flying saucer|flying disc]]" from a nearby ranch. The press release garnered widespread national and even international media attention. The U.S. Army Air Force retracted the claim later the same day, saying instead that a weather balloon had been recovered.  Haut also received some criticism and ridicule in the nation's press for putting out the original press release.  The series of events eventually became known as the [[Roswell UFO Incident]].

When interviewed about the incident decades later, he claimed only a minor role, but he expressed his belief that there was "no chance" senior officers who handled the recovered material, including base commander Blanchard, mistook a weather balloon for a flying saucer.

He later claimed greater involvement, including seeing alien corpses and a craft at a base hangar and handling the strange crash debris.

== Biography ==

Walter Haut was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] on June 3, 1922.  During [[World War II]], he was a [[Bombardier (air force)|bombardier]] flying 35 missions against Japan.  At [[Operation Crossroads]], the [[A-bomb]] tests at the [[Bikini atoll]] in the summer of 1946, he dropped instrument packages to record data from the bomb blasts.  In 1947, he became the public information officer for the [[509th Atomic Bomb Group]] at [[Roswell Army Air Field]] in [[New Mexico]].  The base commander, [[Colonel]] [[William H. Blanchard]], was a close personal friend.

In 1991, Haut and two other men founded the International UFO Museum where he presided as president until 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Pflock, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; Haut died on December 15, 2005 at the age of eighty-three.

==Haut and the Roswell UFO incident==

In the first book on the subject, ''The Roswell Incident'', Haut was said to be "not a witness."(p.&amp;nbsp;72) He told interviewers in 1979 that base commander Colonel William Blanchard asked him to write and distribute the press release but when Haut asked to see the object in question was told "his request was impossible." (p.&amp;nbsp;73)

In ''UFO Crash at Roswell'', Haut appears as a witness, though not to any of actual debris. During a March 1989 interview he said he knew "nothing" about what was recovered. (p.&amp;nbsp;139) He described being asked by Blanchard to write the press release. "I didn't hear about it until, I guess, Jess [Jesse Marcel, head intelligence officer, who initially investigated and recovered some of the debris] was on his way to the flightline." (ibid) He did, however, describe what Marcel told him: "It was something he had never seen and didn't believe it was of this planet. I trusted him on his knowledge." (p.&amp;nbsp;142) He further stated: "I think there was a giant cover-up on this thing." (p.&amp;nbsp;143)

An affidavit signed May 14, 1993, he repeated the above claimed sequence of events and added "I believe Col. Blanchard saw the material, because he sounded positive about what the material was. There is no chance he would have mistaken it for a weather balloon. Neither is there any chance that Major Marcel would have been mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Pflock, ''Roswell: Inconvenient Facts and the Will to Believe'', p.261; [http://www.roswellproof.com/haut.html#anchor_9 copy of 1993 affidavit]&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, Haut, along with Max Littell and [[Glenn Dennis]] had opened the International UFO Museum and Research Center.&lt;ref&gt;Pflock, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, in a recorded interview from 2000 with Wendy Connors&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nicap.org/bios/connors.htm bio - Wendy Connors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and Dennis Balthauser,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truthseekeratroswell.com Truthseeker at Roswell - Dennis Balthaser Independent Roswell Research, Journalist and Lecturer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Haut claimed to have personally viewed an extraterrestrial or alien craft and a body in a Roswell Army Air Field base hangar and being present at a senior staff meeting where a [[cover-up]] of events was discussed.  Haut also placed [[Brigadier General]] [[Roger M. Ramey]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://roswellproof.homestead.com/Ramey_info.html Ramey_info&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; head of the Eighth Army Air Force in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], at the meeting.  Ramey would later tell the press it was in fact a misidentified weather balloon after Haut had put out the press release of the recovered "flying disc."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nicap.org/bios/connors.htm; [http://www.roswellproof.com/haut_2000_interview.html transcript of interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2002, Haut also signed a sealed affidavit in which he went into more details about the craft, debris, bodies, and cover-up.  Both the interview and affidavit were not to be released until after his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roswellproof.com/haut.html text of affidavit]&lt;/ref&gt;

The full text of the affidavit was first published in June 2007 in the book ''Witness to Roswell: Unmasking the 60 Year Cover-Up''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Witness-Roswell-Unmasking-60-Year-Cover-Up/dp/1564149439 Witness to Roswell]'' by Tom J. Carey and Donald R. Schmitt&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the authors, Haut had sworn to his friend Colonel Blanchard not to reveal in his lifetime the events he witnessed and therefore told researchers either that he couldn't remember or that he had only prepared and released the information that was given to him at the time and denied he knew anything else.&lt;ref&gt;Carey &amp; Schmitt, 212-213&lt;/ref&gt;

In his affidavit, Haut stated that on July 8, 1947, following the press release he put out in the afternoon, he was taken out to a base hangar by Colonel Blanchard.  There he saw an egg-shaped craft about 15 feet long and several small bodies about four feet tall with large heads.  He was convinced the bodies were alien and had come from a crashed spacecraft.

Haut also stated that there had been two major crash sites that he had become aware of the day before, the first a large [[debris field]] about 75 miles northwest of Roswell (the site investigated by Major Marcel), and the second, about 40 miles north of town, where the main craft and bodies were found.  The north site had just been found by civilians on July 7, and apparently word had already gotten out about it in the public.

At the staff morning meeting on July 8, which Haut said he attended, key officers at the base were briefed and strange debris was handed around, which nobody could identify.  Haut also said there was a discussion as to what the public was to be told. General Ramey had flown in to attend the meeting.  Haut said Ramey suggested telling the public about the more distant debris field as a diversion from the more accessible and important body/craft site.  He felt Ramey was following orders from [[The Pentagon]].  Haut added he was not aware at the time exactly what information was to be divulged.  But the press release he put out a few hours later spoke of the more distant site in general terms, saying that the Army Air Force had come into possession of a "flying disc" with cooperation of a local rancher, and it was being flown on to "higher headquarters" after being examined at the base.  "Higher headquarters" quickly turned out to be Gen. Ramey in Fort Worth, who within a few hours said the "flying disc" was a misidentified weather balloon.

The '''World Saxophone Congress''' is a festival gathering approximately 1000 [[saxophone|saxophonists]] and other musicians from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://archive.is/20120805201854/http://www1.umn.edu/news/news-releases/2003/UR_RELEASE_MIG_543.html Saxophone Congress Draws 1,000 Saxophonists]", University of Minnesota news, 2003. Retrieved 11 Nov 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is held every three years at a different congress centre in a different country and focuses primarily (although not exclusively) on the performance of classical saxophone music.

The Congress presents an opportunity to meet saxophonists from many countries and to listen to various concerts and performances of saxophone soloists, chamber ensembles, big bands and symphony orchestras that run simultaneously throughout the day in different halls of the congress centre. Each of the five days is concluded by an evening concert of the orchestra and outstanding international soloists. It is also convened with the purpose of presenting the advancements of music production and distribution as well as innovations in instrument-making and equipment.

The seventeenth and most recent World Saxophone Congress, known as SaxOpen, was held between July 9 and 14, 2015 in Strasbourg France. &lt;ref name="wsc2015"&gt;World Saxophone Congress: Strasbourg 2015, retrieved 30 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isc2012"&gt;"[http://www.saxophonecommittee.com/world-saxophone-congress 17th World Saxophone Congress 2015] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503031747/http://www.saxophonecommittee.com/world-saxophone-congress |date=3 May 2016 }}", International Saxophone Committee announcement, May 2012, retrieved 30 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The eighteenth World Saxophone Congress is slated to be held in 2018 in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.saxophonecommittee.com/world-saxophone-congress |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503031747/http://www.saxophonecommittee.com/world-saxophone-congress |archivedate=3 May 2016 |df=dmy }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The World Saxophone Congress was conceived by [[Paul Brodie]] (1934 - 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Paul Harvey, ''Saxophone'', Publisher Kahn &amp; Averill, 1995, {{ISBN|1-871082-53-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-871082-53-1}}, 149 pages ([https://books.google.com/books?id=sZIIAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22World+Saxophone+Congress%22+idea&amp;dq=%22World+Saxophone+Congress%22+idea&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nlC9TqXfG9Pa8QOGzoGOBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA page 131]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founded in 1969 with [[Eugene Rousseau (saxophonist)|Eugene Rousseau]] (b. 1932), holding their first Congress in Chicago.&lt;ref name="ingram1998p48"&gt;Richard Ingham, ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge companion to the saxophone]]'', Publisher Cambridge University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-521-59666-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-59666-4}}, 226 pages.

:"The most memorable time I spent with Paul [Brodie] was our December, 1968 meeting in Chicago. It was during this meeting that he articulated his vision of the establishment of a world saxophone congress. It came to fruition in conjunction with the Midwest Band Clinic during the following year. The World Saxophone Congress, thanks to the dream of Paul Brodie, had become established."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dornpub.com/SaxjPDF/RememberingPaulBrodie_hi_res.pdf Remembering Paul Brodie] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303185754/http://www.dornpub.com/SaxjPDF/RememberingPaulBrodie_hi_res.pdf |date=3 March 2016 }}", ''Saxophone Journal'', Dorn Publishing, May/June 2008 (page 44)&lt;/ref&gt;
Paul Brodie himself recalls:
:"I went to an accordion congress in Toronto and I was so impressed that I thought “wouldn’t it be great to do this for the saxophone”.... The next year I came back to the Midwest Band Clinic. I had written an article for ''Instrumentalist Magazine'' - "Towards a World Saxophone Congress", and I was invited to a meeting of the executive committee and they offered me the grand ballroom of the Sherman House Hotel for 16 December 1969. I asked other saxophone players to help me and nobody responded. I called Eugene Rousseau because I had met him in Seattle at a music convention.... So we met in September 1969 at the Holiday Inn at O’Hare Airport in Chicago and we stayed up all night designing the program and started to call everybody the next morning and by the time we held the first congress we thought that maybe 200 people would show up. Well over 500 saxophonists showed up."&lt;ref name="moolenbeek"&gt;"[http://www.singingsax.com/documents/Paul_Brodie_interview.pdf Paul Brodie: Ambassador of the Saxophone] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318202123/http://www.singingsax.com/documents/Paul_Brodie_interview.pdf |date=18 March 2016 }}", interview by Willem Moolenbeek, 10 January 2000.
