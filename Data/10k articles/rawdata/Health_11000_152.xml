[[File:Puits aerien knappen trans 83 00.jpg|thumb|right|High-mass air well of Belgian engineer [[Achile Knapen]] in [[Trans-en-Provence]].]]
[[File:Dew harvest satapar.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The condenser at Satapar in India consists of eleven ridges. The ridges are trapezoidal in section (top 50&amp;nbsp;cm, base 200&amp;nbsp;cm, two sides sloping 30-degree from horizontal, height 100&amp;nbsp;cm) and each is 20 m long. The ridges are built over gently sloping ground. All the ridges drain into a common pipe at the lower and leading to storage below ground. Water for use is withdrawn by a hand pump. The system was commissioned in early April 2007. Total cost of the installation was [[Rupee|Rs]] 117,000.|A {{convert|550|m2|sqyd}} radiative condenser in northwest India.{{sfn|Sharan|2007}}]]

An '''air well''' or '''aerial well''' is a structure or device that collects water by promoting the [[condensation]] of [[water vapor|moisture]] from air.{{sfn|Popular Science|1933}} Designs for air wells are many and varied, but the simplest designs are completely passive, require no external energy source and have few, if any, moving parts.

Three principal designs are used for air wells, designated as high mass, radiative, and active:
* High-mass air wells: used in the early 20th century, but the approach failed.{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|Nikolayev|Berkowicz|2006}} 
* Low-mass, radiative collectors: Developed in the late 20th century onwards, proved to be much more successful.{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|Nikolayev|Berkowicz|2006}} 
* Active collectors: these collect water in the same way as a [[dehumidifier]]; although the designs work well, they require an energy source, making them uneconomical except in special circumstances. New, innovative designs seek to minimise the energy requirements of active condensers or make use of [[renewable energy]] resources.{{sfn|Nelson|2003}}

==Background==

[[File:Atmospheric Water Vapor Mean.2005.030.jpg|thumb|right|Global atmospheric water vapor for 30 January 2005. Northern hemisphere winter and southern hemisphere summer.]]

All air well designs incorporate a substrate with a temperature sufficiently low so that [[dew]] forms. Dew is a form of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] that occurs naturally when atmospheric water vapour [[condensation|condenses]] onto a substrate. It is distinct from [[fog]], in that fog is made of droplets of water that condense around particles in the air.{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|2000}} Condensation releases [[latent heat]] which must be dissipated in order for water collection to continue.{{sfn|Nikolayev|Beysens|Gioda|Milimouk|1996|pp = 23–26}}

An air well requires moisture from the air. Everywhere on Earth, even in deserts, the surrounding [[atmosphere]] contains at least some water. According to Beysens and Milimouk: "The atmosphere contains [[Orders of magnitude (volume)#Terrestrial|{{nowrap|{{convert|12900|km3}}}}]] of fresh water, composed of 98 percent water vapour and 2 percent condensed water ([[cloud]]s): a figure comparable to the renewable liquid water resources of inhabited lands {{nowrap|(12,500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)}}."{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|2000}} The quantity of water vapour contained within the air is commonly reported as a [[relative humidity]], and this depends on temperature—warmer air can contain more water vapour than cooler air. When air is cooled to the [[dew point]], it becomes saturated, and moisture will condense on a suitable surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the dew temperature of air at {{convert|20|°C|°F}} and 80 percent relative humidity is {{convert|16|°C|°F}}. The dew temperature falls to {{convert|9|°C|°F}} if the relative humidity is 50 percent.{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|2000}}

A related, but quite distinct, technique of obtaining atmospheric moisture is the [[fog fence]].

An air well should not be confused with a [[dew pond]]. A dew pond is an artificial [[pond]] intended for watering livestock. The name ''dew pond'' (sometimes ''cloud pond'' or ''mist pond'') derives from the widely held belief that the pond was filled by moisture from the air.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'': "dew-pond"&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, dew ponds are primarily filled by rainwater.{{sfn|Pugsley|1939}}

A stone [[mulch]] can significantly increase crop yields in [[arid]] areas. This is most notably the case in the [[Canary Islands]]: on the island of [[Lanzarote]] there is about {{convert|140|mm|in}} of rain each year and there are no permanent rivers. Despite this, substantial crops can be grown by using a mulch of volcanic stones, a trick discovered after volcanic eruptions in 1730. Some credit the stone mulch with promoting dew; although the idea has inspired some thinkers, it seems unlikely that the effect is significant. Rather, plants are able to absorb dew directly from their leaves, and the main benefit of a stone mulch is to reduce water loss from the soil and to eliminate competition from weeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==History==

Beginning in the early 20th century, a number of inventors experimented with high-mass collectors. Notable investigators were the Russian engineer [[Friedrich Zibold]] (sometimes given as Friedrich Siebold{{sfn|Nikolayev|Beysens|Gioda|Milimouk|1996|p = 4}}), the French bioclimatologist [[Leon Chaptal]], the German-Australian researcher [[Wolf Klaphake]] and the Belgian inventor [[Achille Knapen]].

===Zibold's collector===

[[File:Zibold condenser (section).jpg|thumb|250px|A section through Zibold's dew condenser. (a) is a truncated cone of beach [[pebble]]s {{convert|20|m}} in diameter at the base and {{convert|8|m}} in diameter at the top. (b) is a concrete bowl; a pipe (not shown) leads away from the base of the bowl to a collecting point. (c) is ground level and (d) is the natural limestone base.&lt;ref&gt;Based on diagram by Nikolayev ''et all'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1900, near the site of the ancient [[Byzantine]] city of [[Feodosiya|Theodosia]], thirteen large piles of stones were discovered by Zibold who was a [[forester]] and engineer in charge of this area.{{sfn|Nikolayev|Beysens|Gioda|Milimouk|1996|pp = 20–23}} Each stone pile covered just over {{convert|900|m2}} and was about {{convert|10|m}} tall. The finds were associated with the remains of {{convert|75|mm|in|adj=mid|diameter}} [[terracotta]] pipes that apparently led to wells and fountains in the city. Zibold concluded that the stacks of stone were condensers that supplied Theodosia with water; and calculated that each air well produced more than {{convert|55400|l}} each day.{{sfn|Nikolayev|Beysens|Gioda|Milimouk|1996|p = 4}}

To verify his hypothesis Zibold constructed a stone-pile condenser at an altitude of {{convert|288|m}} on mount Tepe-Oba near the ancient site of Theodosia. Zibold's condenser was surrounded by a wall {{convert|1|m}} high, {{convert|20|m}} wide, around a bowl-shaped collection area with drainage. He used sea stones {{convert|10|-|40|cm|in}} in diameter piled {{convert|6|m}} high in a truncated cone that was {{convert|8|m}} in diameter across the top. The shape of the stone pile allowed a good air flow with only minimal thermal contact between the stones.{{sfn|Nelson|2003}}

Zibold's condenser began to operate in 1912 with a maximum daily production that was later estimated to have been {{convert|360|l}} – Zibold made no public record of his results at the time.{{sfn|Nikolayev|Beysens|Gioda|Milimouk|1996|p = 4}} The base developed leaks that forced the experiment to end in 1915 and the site was partially dismantled before being abandoned. (The site was rediscovered in 1993 and cleaned up.){{sfn|Nelson|2003}} Zibold's condenser was approximately the same size as the ancient stone piles that had been found,{{sfn|Nelson|2003}} and although the yield was very much less than the yield Zibold had calculated for the original structures, the experiment was an inspiration for later developers.

===Chaptal's collector===

Inspired by Zibold's work, Chaptal built a small air well near [[Montpellier]] in 1929. Chaptal's condenser was a [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramidal]] concrete structure {{convert|3|m}} square and {{convert|2.5|m}} high, it was filled with {{convert|8|m3}} of [[limestone]] pieces being about {{convert|7.5|cm}} in diameter. Small vent holes ringed the top and bottom of the pyramid. These holes could be closed or opened as required to control the flow of air. The structure was allowed to cool during the night, and then warm moist air was let in during the day. Dew formed on the limestone pieces and collected in a reservoir below ground level. The amount of water obtained varied from {{convert|1|l}} to {{convert|2.5|l}} per day depending on the atmospheric conditions.{{sfn|Hills|1966|p = 232}}

Chaptal did not consider his experiment a success. When he retired in 1946, he put the condenser out of order, possibly because he did not want to leave an improper installation to mislead those who might later continue studies on air wells.{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|Nikolayev|Berkowicz|2006}}

===Klaphake's collectors===

[[Wolf Klaphake]] was a successful chemist working in Berlin during the 1920s and 1930s. During that time, he tested several forms of air wells in [[Yugoslavia]] and on [[Vis (island)|Vis Island]] in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Klaphake's work was inspired by Zibold{{sfn|Klaphake|1936}} and by the works of [[Maimonides]], a known Jewish scholar who wrote in Arabic about 1,000 years ago and who mentioned the use of water condensers in Palestine.{{sfn|Nelson|2003}}

Klaphake experimented with a very simple design: an area of mountain slope was cleared and smoothed with a watertight surface. It was shaded by a simple canopy supported by pillars or ridges. The sides of the structure were closed, but the top and bottom edges were left open. At night the mountain slope would cool, and in the day moisture would collect on and run down the smoothed surface. Although the system apparently worked, it was expensive, and Klaphake finally adopted a more compact design based on a masonry structure. This design was a [[sugarloaf]]-shaped building, about {{convert|15|m}} high, with walls at least {{convert|2|m|sigfig=1}} thick, with holes on the top and at the bottom. The outer wall was made of concrete to give a high thermal capacity, and the inner surface was made of a porous material such as sandstone.{{sfn|Sharan|2006|p = 72}} According to Klaphake:

{{cquote|The building produces water during the day and cools itself during the night; when the sun rises, the warm air is drawn through the upper holes into the building by the out-flowing cooler air, becomes cooled on the cold surface, deposits its water, which then oozes down and is collected somewhere underneath. It is wrong to think that this process works only on days with dew, as the inner surface becomes much cooler than one should expect. In Dalmatia, that day was a rare exception which failed to produce water.{{sfn|Klaphake|1936}} }}

Traces of Klaphake's condensers have been tentatively identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1935, Wolf Klaphake and his wife Maria emigrated to Australia. The Klaphakes' decision to emigrate was probably primarily the result of Maria's encounters with Nazi authorities;{{sfn|Neumann|2002|p = 7}}&lt;ref name="uncommon lives2"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; their decision to settle in Australia (rather than, say, in Britain) was influenced by Wolf's desire to develop a dew condenser.&lt;ref name="uncommon lives2" /&gt; As a dry continent, Australia was likely to need alternative sources of fresh water, and the Premier of [[South Australia]], whom he had met in London, had expressed an interest. Klaphake made a specific proposal for a condenser at the small town of [[Cook, South Australia|Cook]], where there was no supply of potable water. At Cook, the railway company had previously installed a large coal-powered active condenser,&lt;ref name="cook condenser"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1930, Knapen's dew tower took 18 months to build; it still stands today, albeit in dilapidated condition. At the time of its construction, the condenser excited some public interest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oygDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Science%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_P1UTf6QMYH-8Abd79mOBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Science%201933%20plane%20%22Popular%20Science%22&amp;f=true "Air Well Waters Parched Farms"] ''Popular Science'', March 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

The tower is {{convert|14|m}} high and has massive masonry walls about {{convert|3|m}} thick with a number of apertures to let in air. Inside there is a massive column made of concrete. At night, the whole structure is allowed to cool, and during the day warm moist air enters the structure via the high apertures, cools, descends, and leaves the building by the lower apertures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knapen's intention was that water should condense on the cool inner column. In keeping with Chaptal's finding that the condensing surface must be rough and the surface tension must be sufficiently low that the condensed water can drip, the central column's outer surface was studded with projecting plates of [[slate]]. The slates were placed nearly vertically to encourage dripping down to a collecting basin at the bottom of the structure.{{sfn|Nelson|2003}} Unfortunately, the aerial well never achieved anything like its hoped-for performance and produced no more than a few litres of water each day.{{sfn|Sharan|2006|p = 70}}

[[File:Dr Sharan at condenser test ground.JPG|thumb|left|A radiative dew condenser test site at village Kothar in the north-west India near Arabian sea coast.]]

By the end of the twentieth century, the mechanics of how dew condenses were much better understood. The key insight was that low-mass collectors which rapidly lose heat by [[thermal radiation|radiation]] perform best. A number of researchers worked on this method.{{sfn|Sharan|2006|p = 22}} In the early 1960s, dew condensers made from sheets of [[polyethylene]] supported on a simple frame resembling a ridge tent were used in Israel to irrigate plants. Saplings supplied with dew and very slight rainfall from these collectors survived much better than the control group planted without such aids&amp;nbsp;– they all dried up over the summer.{{sfn|Gindel|1965}} In 1986 in [[New Mexico]] condensers made of a special foil produced sufficient water to supply young saplings.{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|2000}}

In 1992 a party of French academics attended a [[condensed matter]] conference in [[Ukraine]] where [[physicist]] Daniel Beysens introduced them to the story of how ancient Theodosia was supplied with water from dew condensers. They were sufficiently intrigued that in 1993 they went to see for themselves. They concluded that the mounds that Zibold identified as dew condensers were in fact [[tumulus|ancient burial mounds]] (a part of the [[necropolis]] of ancient Theodosia) and that the pipes were medieval in origin and not associated with the construction of the mounds. They found the remains of Zibold's condenser, which they tidied up and examined closely. Zibold's condenser had apparently performed reasonably well, but in fact his exact results are not at all clear, and it is possible that the collector was intercepting fog, which added significantly to the yield.{{sfn|Nikolayev|Beysens|Gioda|Milimouk|1996|p = 4}} If Zibold's condenser worked at all, this was probably due to fact that a few stones near the surface of the mound were able to lose heat at night while being thermally isolated from the ground; however, it could never have produced the yield that Zibold envisaged.{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|Nikolayev|Berkowicz|2006}}{{sfn|Nikolayev|Beysens|Gioda|Milimouk|1996}}

Fired with enthusiasm, the party returned to France and set up the ''International Organisation for Dew Utilization'' (OPUR), with the specific objective of making dew available as an alternative source of water.&lt;ref name="opur.fr"&gt;{{cite web

OPUR began a study of dew condensation under laboratory conditions; they developed a special [[hydrophobic]] film and experimented with trial installations, including a {{convert|30|m2|sqft}} collector in [[Corsica]].{{sfn|Muselli|Beysens|Milimouk|2006}} Vital insights included the idea that the [[thermal mass|mass]] of the condensing surface should be as low as possible so that it cannot easily retain heat, that it should be protected from unwanted thermal radiation by a layer of [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], and that it should be hydrophobic, so as to shed condensed moisture readily.{{sfn|Sharan|2006|pp = 20–28}}

By the time they were ready for their first practical installation, they heard that one of their members, Girja Sharan, had obtained a grant to construct a dew condenser in Kothara, India. In April 2001, Sharan had incidentally noticed substantial condensation on the roof of a cottage at [[Toran]] Beach Resort in the arid coastal region of [[Kutch]], where he was briefly staying. The following year, he investigated the phenomenon more closely and interviewed local people. Financed by the Gujarat Energy Development Agency and the [[World Bank]], Sharan and his team went on to develop passive, radiative condensers for use in the arid coastal region of Kutch.{{sfn|Sharan|2006|loc = Acknowledgement section}} Active commercialisation began in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Sharan tested a wide range of materials and got good results from [[galvanised iron]] and [[aluminium]] sheets, but found that sheets of the special plastic developed by the OPUR just {{convert|400|um}} thick generally worked even better than the metal sheets and were less expensive.{{sfn|Sharan|2006|p = 27}} The plastic film, known as OPUR foil, is hydrophilic and is made from polyethylene mixed with [[titanium dioxide]]&lt;!--Sharan is ambiguous with "titanium oxide" but the source at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0169-8095(02)00100-X says it's titanium dioxide--&gt; and [[barium sulphate]].

==Types==

There are three principal approaches to the design of the heat sinks that collect the moisture in air wells: high mass, radiative and active. Early in the twentieth century, there was interest in high-mass air wells, but despite much experimentation including the construction of massive structures, this approach proved to be a failure.{{sfn|Alton Stewart|Howell|2003|p = 1014}}

From the late twentieth century onwards, there has been much investigation of low-mass, [[thermal radiation|radiative]] collectors; these have proved to be much more successful.

===High-mass===

The high-mass air well design attempts to cool a large mass of masonry with cool nighttime air entering the structure due to breezes or natural convection. In the day, the warmth of the sun results in increased atmospheric humidity. When moist daytime air enters the air well, it condenses on the presumably cool masonry. None of the high-mass collectors performed well, Knapen's aerial well being a particularly conspicuous example.

The problem with the high-mass collectors was that they could not get rid of sufficient heat during the night&amp;nbsp;– despite design features intended to ensure that this would happen.{{sfn|Nelson|2003}} While some thinkers have believed that Zibold might have been correct after all,&lt;ref name="popular science 1992"&gt;{{cite journal

{{cquote|We would like to stress the following point. To obtain condensation, the condenser temperature of the stones must be lower than the dew point temperature. When there is no fog, the dew point temperature is always lower than the air temperature. Meteorological data shows that the dew point temperature (an indicator of the water content of the air) does not change appreciably when the weather is stable. ''Thus wind, which ultimately imposes air temperature to the condenser, cannot cool the condenser to ensure its functioning.'' Another cooling phenomenon&amp;nbsp;— radiative cooling&amp;nbsp;— must operate. It is therefore at night-time, when the condenser cools by radiation, that liquid water can be extracted from air. It is very rare that the dew point temperature would increase significantly so as to exceed the stone temperature inside the stone heap. Occasionally, when this does happen, dew can be abundant during a short period of time. This is why subsequent attempts by L. Chaptal and A. Knapen to build massive dew condensers only rarely resulted in significant yields. [Emphasis as in original]{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|Nikolayev|Berkowicz|2006}} }}

Although ancient air wells are mentioned in some sources, there is scant evidence for them, and persistent belief in their existence has the character of a [[Urban legend|modern myth]].{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|Nikolayev|Berkowicz|2006}}

===Radiative===

[[File:Dew water from metal roofs.jpg|thumb|right|Structures with metal roofing, such as this one, can be used to harvest dew water simply by adding gutters and, for increased output, a layer of insulation underside.

This installation is on school buildings at Sayara (Kutch, India). Unlike metal roofs, concrete roofs do not attract condensation without any treatment, hence the need for an external condenser. The output from such condensers is nearly two times higher than from a bare metal roof, all else remaining constant.]]

A radiative air well is designed to cool a substrate by [[thermal radiation|radiating heat]] to the night sky. The substrate has a low mass so that it cannot hold onto heat, and it is thermally isolated from any mass, including the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; A typical radiative collector presents a condensing surface at an angle of 30° from the horizontal. The condensing surface is backed by a thick layer of insulating material such as [[polystyrene foam]] and supported {{convert|2|-|3|m|ft|sigfig=1}} above ground level. Such condensers may be conveniently installed on the ridge roofs of low buildings or supported by a simple frame.{{sfn|Sharan|2006|pp = 20–39}} Although other heights do not typically work quite so well, it may be less expensive or more convenient to mount a collector near to ground level or on a two-story building.{{sfn|Sharan|2006|pp = 40–59}}

The {{convert|600|m2}} radiative condenser illustrated near the start of this article is built near the ground. In the area of north-west India where it is installed dew occurs for 8 months a year, and the installation collects about {{convert|15|mm}} of dew water over the season with nearly 100 dew-nights. In a year it provides a total of about {{convert|9000|l}} of [[Drinking water|potable water]] for the school which owns and operates the site.{{sfn|Sharan|2007}}

Although flat designs have the benefit of simplicity, other designs such as inverted pyramids and cones can be significantly more effective. This is probably because the designs shield the condensing surfaces from unwanted heat radiated by the lower atmosphere, and, being symmetrical, they are not sensitive to wind direction.{{sfn|Clus|Ouazzani|Muselli|Nikolayev|2006}}

New materials may make even better collectors.{{sfn|Sharan|2006|p = 20}} One such material is inspired by the [[Namib Desert beetle]], which survives only on the moisture it extracts from the atmosphere. It has been found that its back is coated with microscopic projections: the peaks are hydrophilic and the troughs are hydrophobic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{main|Atmospheric water generator}}

Active atmospheric water collectors have been in use since the commercialisation of mechanical [[refrigeration]]. Essentially, all that is required is to cool a [[heat exchanger]] below the dew point, and water will be produced. Such water production may take place as a [[by-product]], possibly unwanted, of [[Dehumidifier|dehumidification]].{{sfn|Nelson|2003}} The air conditioning system of the [[Burj Khalifa]] in [[Dubai]], for example, produces an estimated {{convert|15|e6USgal|m3}} of water each year that is used for irrigating the tower's landscape plantings.&lt;ref name="gn"&gt;{{cite news

Because mechanical refrigeration is energy intensive, active collectors are typically restricted to places where there is no supply of water that can be [[desalination|desalinated]] or purified at a lower cost and that are sufficiently far from a supply of fresh water to make transport uneconomical. Such circumstances are uncommon, and even then large installations such as that tried in the 1930s at Cook in South Australia failed because of the cost of running the installation – it was cheaper to transport water over large distances.&lt;ref name="uncommon lives3" /&gt;

In the case of small installations, convenience may outweigh cost. There is a wide range of small machines designed to be used in offices that produce a few litres of drinking water from the atmosphere. However, there are circumstances where there really is no source of water other than the atmosphere. For example, in the 1930s, American designers added condenser systems to [[airships]]&amp;nbsp;– in this case the air was that emitted by the exhaust of the engines, and so it contained additional water as a product of combustion. The moisture was collected and used as additional ballast to compensate for the loss of weight as fuel was consumed. By collecting ballast in this way, the airship's buoyancy could be kept relatively constant without having to release helium gas, which was both expensive and in limited supply.{{sfn|Allen|1931|p = 37}}

More recently, on the [[International Space Station]], the [[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda module]] includes a humidity control system. The water it collects is usually used to supply the [[ISS ECLSS#Elektron|Elektron]] system that electrolyses water into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]], but it can be used for drinking in an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are a number of designs that minimise the energy requirements of active condensers:

* One method is to use the ground as a [[heat sink]] by drawing air through underground pipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; This is often done to provide a source of cool air for a building by means of a [[ground-coupled heat exchanger]] (also known as ''Earth tubes''), wherein condensation is typically regarded as a significant problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A major problem with such designs is that the underground tubes are subject to contamination and difficult to keep clean. Designs of this type require air to be drawn through the pipes by a fan, but the power required may be provided (or supplemented) by a [[wind turbine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference

* Cold seawater is used in the [[Seawater Greenhouse]] to both cool and humidify the interior of [[greenhouse]]-like structure. The cooling can be so effective that not only do the plants inside benefit from reduced [[transpiration]], but dew collects on the outside of the structure and can easily be collected by gutters.{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|2000}}
* Another type of atmospheric water collector makes use of [[desiccant]]s which adsorb atmospheric water at ambient temperature, this makes it possible to extract moisture even when the relative humidity is as low as 14 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cartlidge|2009|pp = 26–27}} For regeneration, the desiccant needs to be heated.{{sfn|Cartlidge|2009|p = 16}} In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is ventilated at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb the water vapour.

The '''Alcohol Advisory Council of New Zealand''' ("ALAC") was established in 1976, by the government of [[New Zealand]], under the Alcohol Advisory Council Act of 1976,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1976/0143/latest/DLM439969.html Alcohol Advisory Council Act 1976]&lt;/ref&gt; following a report by the [[Royal Commission of Inquiry]] into the Sale of [[Liquor]]. Its purpose is "the encouragement and promotion of moderation in the use of liquor, the discouragement and reduction of the [[Alcohol abuse|misuse of liquor]], and the minimisation of the personal, social, and economic harm resulting from the misuse of liquor."

ALAC is funded by a [[Tax|levy]] on alcohol produced and imported for sale in New Zealand. The levy is collected by the [[New Zealand Customs Service|Customs Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alcohol.org.nz/WhoAreWe.aspx |title=Official Alcohol Advisory Council website |access-date=2008-11-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023163636/http://www.alcohol.org.nz/WhoAreWe.aspx |archive-date=2008-10-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current operations==
ALAC has a 2008/09 [[budget]] of $12.7m and spent $13m in the 2007 year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasury.govt.nz/government/financialstatements/yearend/jun07/54.htm www.treasury.govt.nz.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most of its work revolves around providing information ([[pamphlet]]s, on-line resources), advertising&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voxy.co.nz/national/alac-ads-win-advertising-award/5/4146 www.voxy.co.nz.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[education program]]s.

'''Autosomal Dominant Retinal Vasculopathy with Cerebral Leukodystrophy''' (AD-RVCL) (previously known also as Cerebroretinal Vasculopathy, CRV, or Hereditary Vascular Retinopathy, HVR or  Hereditary Endotheliopathy, Retinopathy, Nephropathy, and Stroke, HERNS) is an inherited condition resulting from a [[frameshift mutation]] to the [[TREX1]] gene. This genetically inherited condition affects the retina and the white matter of the central nervous system, resulting in vision loss, lacunar strokes and ultimately dementia. Symptoms commonly begin in the early to mid-forties, and treatments currently aim to manage or alleviate the symptoms rather than treating the underlying cause. The overall prognosis is poor, and death can sometimes occur within 10 years of the first symptoms appearing.&lt;ref&gt;https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/1217/retinal-vasculopathy-with-cerebral-leukodystrophy/resources/1&lt;/ref&gt;


==Presentation==

*No recognizable symptoms until after age 40.
*No environmental toxins have been found to be attributable to the condition.
*The condition is primarily localized to the brain and eyes.  
*Optically correctable, but continuous, deterioration of visual acuity due to extensive multifocal microvascular abnormalities and retinal neovascularization leading, ultimately, to a loss of vision.  
*Elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase.  
*Subtle vascular changes in the retina resembling telangiectasia (spider veins) in the [[parafovea]] circulation.  
*Bilateral capillary occlusions involving the perifovea vessels as well as other isolated foci of occlusion in the posterior pole of the retina.  
*Headaches due to papilledema.
*Mental confusion, loss of cognitive function, loss of memory, slowing of speech and hemiparesis due to “firm masses” and white, granular, firm lesions in the brain.  
*Jacksonian seizures and grand mal seizure disorder.  
*Progressive neurologic deterioration unresponsive to systemic corticosteroid therapy.
*Discrete, often confluent, foci of coagulation necrosis in the cerebral white matter with intermittent findings of fine calcium deposition within the necrotic foci.
*Vasculopathic changes involving both arteries and veins of medium and small caliber present in the cerebral white matter. 
*Fibroid necrosis of vessel walls with extravasation of fibrinoid material into adjacent parenchyma present in both necrotic and non-necrotic tissue.  
*Obliterative fibrosis in all the layers of many vessel walls.  
*Parivascular, adventitial fibrosis with limited intimal thickening.
===Clinical Associations===

*[[Raynaud's phenomenon]]
*[[Anemia]]
*[[Hypertension]]
*[[Normocytic anemia]]
*[[Normochromic anemia]]
*[[Gastrointestinal bleeding]] or [[telangiectasias]]
*[[Elevated alkaline phosphatase]]

==Genetics==

The official name of the TREX1 gene is “three prime repair exonuclease 1.”  The normal function of the TREX1 gene is to provide instructions for making the 3-prime repair exonuclease 1 enzyme. This enzyme is a DNA exonuclease, which means it trims molecules of DNA by removing DNA building blocks (nucleotides) from the ends of the molecules. In this way, it breaks down unneeded DNA molecules or fragments that may be generated during genetic material in preparation for cell division, DNA repair, cell death, and other processes.
 
Changes (mutations) to the TREX1 gene can result in a range of conditions one of which is AD-RVCL.  The mutations to the TREX1 gene are believed to prevent the production of the 3-prime repair exonuclease 1 enzyme. Researchers suggest that the absence of this enzyme may result in an accumulation of unneeded DNA and RNA in cells. These DNA and RNA molecules may be mistaken by cells for those of viral invaders, triggering immune system reactions that result in the symptoms of AD-RVCL.

Mutations in the TREX1 gene have also been identified in people with other disorders involving the immune system. These disorders include a chronic inflammatory disease called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), including a rare form of SLE called chilblain lupus that mainly affects the skin.

The TREX1 gene is located on chromosome 3: base pairs 48,465,519 to 48,467,644

[[File:TREX1 gene location.jpg|600px|frameless|center|TREX1 Gene Location]]

===The immune system===

*The immune system is composed of white blood cells or [[leukocytes]]. 
*There are 5 different types of leukocytes.  
*Combined, the 5 different leukocytes represent the 2 types of immune systems (The general or innate immune system and the adaptive or acquired immune system).
*The adaptive immune system is composed of two types of cells ([[B-cells]] which release antibodies and [[T-cells]] which destroy abnormal and cancerous cells).

====immune system becomes part of the condition====

During [[mitosis]], tiny fragments of “scrap” single strand DNA naturally occur inside the cell.  Enzymes find and destroy the “scrap” DNA.  The TREX1 gene provides the information necessary to create the enzyme that destroys this single strand “scrap” DNA.  A mutation in the TREX1 gene causes the enzyme that would destroy the single strand DNA to be less than completely effective.  The less than completely effective nature of the enzyme allows “scrap” single strand DNA to build up in the cell.  The buildup of “scrap” single strand DNA alerts the immune system that the cell is abnormal.

The abnormality of the cells with the high concentration of “scrap” DNA triggers a T-cell response and the abnormal cells are destroyed.  Because the TREX1 gene is identical in all of the cells in the body the ineffective enzyme allows the accumulation of “scrap” single strand DNA in all of the cells in the body.  Eventually, the immune system has destroyed enough of the cells in the walls of the blood vessels that the capillaries burst open.  The capillary bursting happens throughout the body but is most recognizable when it happens in the eyes and brain because these are the two places where capillary bursting has the most pronounced effect.

==Pathogenesis==
The main pathologic process centers on small blood vessels that prematurely “drop out” and disappear.  The retina of the eye and white matter of the brain are the most sensitive to this pathologic process.  Over a five to ten-year period, this vasculopathy (blood vessel pathology) results in vision loss and destructive brain lesions with neurologic deficits and death.

Most recently, AD-RVCL (CRV) has been renamed.  The new name is CHARIOT which stands for '''C'''erebral '''H'''ereditary '''A'''ngiopathy with vascular '''R'''etinopathy and '''I'''mpaired '''O'''rgan function caused by '''T'''REX1 mutations. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

'''Bar code medication administration''' ('''BCMA''') is a [[barcode system|bar code system]] designed by Glenna Sue Kennick  to prevent [[medication error]]s in healthcare settings and to improve the quality and safety of medication administration.  The overall goals of BCMA are to improve accuracy, prevent errors, and generate online records of medication administration. 

==History==
BCMA was first implemented in 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wideman |first1=Mary V. |last2=Whittler |first2=Michael E.|last3=Anderson |first3=Timothy M. |name-list-format=vanc |date=February 2005 |contribution=Barcode medication administration: Lessons learned from an intensive care unit implementation |contribution-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20569/ |pages=437–51 |title=Implementation Issues |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20545/ |series=Advances in Patient Safety: From Research to Implementation |volume=3 |editor1-last=Henriksen |editor1-first=Kerm |editor2-last=Battles |editor2-first=James B. |editor3-last=Marks |editor3-first=Eric S. |editor4-last=Lewin |editor4-first=David I. |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |location=Rockville, MD |via=NCBI Bookshelf }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Colmery-O'Neil Veteran Medical Center in [[Topeka]], Kansas, US. It was created by a nurse who was inspired by a car rental service using bar code technology. From 1999 to 2001, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] promoted the system to 161 facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Coyle GA, Heinen M |date=January 2005 |title=Evolution of BCMA Within the Department of Veterans Affairs |journal=Nursing Administration Quarterly |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=32–8 |pmid=15779703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cummings and others recommend the BCMA system for its reduction of errors. They suggest healthcare settings to consider the system first while they are waiting for [[radio-frequency identification|radiofrequency identification]] (RFID). They also pointed out that adopting the system takes a careful plan and a deep change in work patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cummings J, Bush P, Smith D, Matuszewski K |date=15 December 2005 |title=Bar-coding medication administration overview and consensus recommendations |journal=American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy |volume=62 |issue=24 |pages=2626–9 |pmid=16333061 |doi=10.2146/ajhp050222 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the year 2004, hospitals were mandated by the federal government to start using BCMA for all prescription drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gs1.org/docs/healthcare/events/170608/28_Callaghan_FDA.pdf|title=FDA Federal Bar Code Requirements for Drugs|last=Callahan|first=Elizabeth|date=June 20, 2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
It consists of a [[barcode reader|bar code reader]], a portable or desktop computer with wireless connection, a computer server, and some software. When a nurse gives medication to a patient in a healthcare setting, the nurse can scan the barcode on the patient's wristband on the patient to verify the patient's identity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4687">'''Bioburden''' is normally defined as the number of bacteria living on a surface that has not been sterilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Mosby's Dental Dictionary | edition = 2nd | date = 2008 | publisher = Elsevier, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is most often used in the context of bioburden testing, also known as microbial limit testing, which is performed on [[Medication|pharmaceutical product]]s and medical products for [[quality control]] purposes.  Products or components used in the pharmaceutical or medical field require control of [[microbe|microbial]] levels during processing and handling. Bioburden or microbial limit testing on these products proves that these requirements have been met.  Bioburden testing for medical devices made or used in the USA is governed by [[Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations]] and worldwide by [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 11737.

The aim of bioburden testing is to measure the total number of viable micro-organisms (total microbial count) on a medical device prior to its final sterilization before implantation or use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacelabs.com/life-sciences/combination-products/bioburd.html Pace Analytical]&lt;/ref&gt;

21 C.F.R. 211.110 (a)(6) states that bioburden in-process testing must be conducted pursuant to written procedures during the manufacturing process of drug products.&lt;ref&gt;21 C.F.R. 211.110 (a) (6)&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) outlines several tests that can be done to quantitatively determine the bioburden of non-sterile drug products.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

It is important when conducting these tests to ensure that the testing method does not either introduce bacteria into the test sample or kill bacteria in the test sample.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;USP 31 &lt;61&gt; Microbiological Examination. http://www.usp.org/sites/default/files/usp_pdf/EN/USPNF/generalChapter61.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; To prepare drug products for testing, they must be dissolved in certain substances based on their "physical characteristics."&lt;ref name="test" /&gt; For example, a water-soluble drug product should be dissolved in "Buffered Sodium Chloride-Peptone Solution pH 7.0, Phosphate Buffer Solution pH 7.2, or Soybean-Casein Digest Broth."&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

The Membrane-Filtration Method and Plate Count Method can be used to measure the number of microbes in a sample.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt; In the '''Membrane-Filtration Method''', the sample is passed through a membrane filter with a pore size of 0.45 micrometers or less.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt; The membrane filter is then placed onto Soybean-Casein Digest Agar and incubated in order to be able to determine the total aerobic microbial count (TAMC).&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

In the '''Plate Count Method''', the sample of drug product to be tested and Soybean-Casein Digest Broth is poured into a Petri dish.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt; The Petri dish is then incubated. The [[most probable number]] method (MPN) can also be performed for products considered to have a low bioburden{{clarify|date=June 2014}}. The MPN is considered to be one of the least accurate tests.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

The bioburden quantification is expressed in [[colony forming unit]] (CFU). There are generally established guidelines for the maximum CFU that a drug product can contain.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt; Contact plates or sterile swabs can also be used to test for microbes on a surface when compounding sterile products to ensure compliance with USP 797.&lt;ref&gt;PathCon Laboratories. http://www.pathcon.com/documents/MB_USP_797.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioburden is also associated with [[biofouling]], where microbes collect on the surface of a device or inside of fan cooled equipment.  In healthcare settings, this increases the risk of [[Healthcare-associated infections]] (HAIs) or [[Hospital-acquired infection]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s as pathogens can be spread through contact or through the air to new patients and hospital staff.  Fan cooled system are generally avoided in critical care and operating rooms, thus relying on natural convection or liquid cooling to cool devices and equipment. Clean rooms (surgical operating rooms, for example) are also required to maintain positive air pressure so that air may leave those rooms, but contaminated air cannot enter from adjacent spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ashe.org/management_monographs/pdfs/mg2011love.pdf|title=Operating Room HVAC Setback Strategies|last=Lowe|first=Christy|date=2011|website=The American Society for Healthcare Engineering (ASHE)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HEPA]] filters are also used to collect airborne pathogens larger than 0.3 microns.

Birth control methods include [[barrier methods]], [[hormonal birth control]], [[intrauterine devices]] (IUDs), [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]], and behavioral methods. They are used before or during sex while [[emergency contraceptive]]s are effective for up to five days after sex. Effectiveness is generally expressed as the percentage of women who become pregnant using a given method during the first year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon Edlin|author2=Eric Golanty|author3=Kelli McCormack Brown|title=Essentials for health and wellness|year=2000|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|location=Sudbury, Mass.|isbn=978-0-7637-0909-9|page=161|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0H4iyS_DFwC&amp;pg=PA162|edition=2nd|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610000602/https://books.google.com/books?id=_0H4iyS_DFwC&amp;pg=PA162|archivedate=June 10, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes as a lifetime failure rate among methods with high effectiveness, such as [[tubal ligation]].&lt;ref name=Dew2012&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Edmonds|editor-first=D.

Contraceptive use in [[developing countries]] is estimated to have decreased the number of [[maternal death]]s by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% of deaths if the full demand for birth control were met.&lt;ref name="pmid22784533" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22784531" /&gt; These benefits are achieved by reducing the number of unplanned pregnancies that subsequently result in unsafe abortions and by preventing pregnancies in those at high risk.&lt;ref name="pmid22784533" /&gt;

Birth control also improves child survival in the developing world by lengthening the time between pregnancies.&lt;ref name="pmid22784533" /&gt; In this population, outcomes are worse when a mother gets pregnant within eighteen months of a previous delivery.&lt;ref name="pmid22784533" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shol2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sholapurkar|first=SL|title=Is there an ideal interpregnancy interval after a live birth, miscarriage or other adverse pregnancy outcomes?|journal=Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology|date=February 2010|volume=30|issue=2|pages=107–10|pmid=20143964|doi=10.3109/01443610903470288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delaying another pregnancy after a [[miscarriage]] however does not appear to alter risk and women are advised to attempt pregnancy in this situation whenever they are ready.&lt;ref name=Shol2010 /&gt;

In the developing world, birth control increases [[economic growth]] due to there being fewer dependent children and thus more women participating in or increased contribution to the [[workforce]].&lt;ref name="pmid22784535" /&gt; Women's earnings, assets, [[body mass index]], and their children's schooling and body mass index all improve with greater access to birth control.&lt;ref name="pmid22784535" /&gt; [[Family planning]], via the use of modern birth control, is one of the most [[cost-effective]] health interventions.&lt;ref name=Tsui2010 /&gt; For every dollar spent, the United Nations estimates that two to six dollars are saved.&lt;ref name="pmid22784540" /&gt; These cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses.&lt;ref name=Tsui2010 /&gt; While all methods are beneficial financially, the use of copper IUDs resulted in the greatest savings.&lt;ref name=Tsui2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsui AO, McDonald-Mosley R, Burke AE |title=Family planning and the burden of unintended pregnancies |journal=Epidemiol Rev |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=152–74 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20570955 |pmc=3115338 |doi=10.1093/epirev/mxq012 |url= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first permanent birth-control clinic was established in Britain in 1921 by [[Marie Stopes]] working with the Malthusian League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hall, Ruth |title=Passionate Crusader |publisher=Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich |year=1977 |page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinic, run by midwives and supported by visiting doctors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marie Carmichael Stopes |title=The First Five Thousand |year=1925 |publisher=John Bale, Sons &amp; Danielsson |location=London |oclc=12690936 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; offered women's birth-control advice and taught them the use of a [[cervical cap]].

In April 1930 the Birth Control Conference assembled 700 delegates and was successful in bringing birth control and abortion into the political sphere – three months later, the [[Ministry of Health]], in the United Kingdom, allowed local authorities to give birth-control advice in welfare centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Lesley|title=The life and times of Stella Browne : feminist and free spirit|location=London|publisher=I.

The National Birth Control Association was founded in Britain in 1931, and became the [[Family Planning Association]] eight years later. The Association amalgamated several British birth control-focused groups into 'a central organisation' for administering and overseeing birth control in Britain. The group incorporated the Birth Control Investigation Committee, a collective of physicians and scientists that was founded to investigate scientific and medical aspects of contraception with 'neutrality and impartiality'.&lt;ref&gt;BCIC Memorandum on Proposed Re-organisation [c.1931]. Wellcome Library, Archives of the Eugenics Society (WL/SA/EUG/D/12/12.)&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the Association effected a series of [[pure science|'pure']] and [[Applied science|'applied']] product and safety standards that manufacturers must meet to ensure their contraceptives could be prescribed as part of the Association's standard two-part-technique combining ‘a rubber appliance to protect the mouth of the womb’ with a ‘chemical preparation capable of destroying... sperm’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wright |first1=Helena |title=Birth Control: Advice on Family Spacing and Healthy Sex Life |date=1935 |publisher=Cassell's Health Handbooks |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1931 and 1959, the Association founded and funded a series of tests to assess chemical efficacy and safety and rubber quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=SZUHAN |first1=NATASHA |title=Sex in the laboratory: the Family Planning Association and contraceptive science in Britain, 1929–1959 |journal=The British Journal for the History of Science |date=28 June 2018 |pages=1–24 |doi=10.1017/S0007087418000481}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tests became the basis for the Association's Approved List of contraceptives, which was launched in 1937, and went on to become an annual publication that the expanding network of FPA clinics relied upon as a means to 'establish facts [about contraceptives] and to publish these facts as a basis on which a sound public and scientific opinion can be built'.&lt;ref&gt;Birth Control Investigation Committee Statement of Intent [c.1927], Wellcome Library, Archives of the Family Planning Association (WL/SA/FPA), WL/SA/FPA/A13/5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 the U.S. court ruled in U.S. v. One Package that medically prescribing contraception to save a person's life or well-being was not illegal under the [[Comstock Law]]; following this decision, the [[American Medical Association]] Committee on Contraception revoked its 1936 statement condemning birth control. A national survey in 1937 showed 71 percent of the adult population supported the use of contraception. By 1938 347 birth control clinics were running in the United States despite their advertisement still being illegal. [[First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] publicly supported birth control and family planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alesha Doan|title=Opposition and Intimidation: The Abortion Wars and Strategies of Political Harassment|date=2007|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-06975-0|pages=53–54|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, [[Lyndon B.

[[Human rights]] agreements require most governments to provide family planning and contraceptive information and services.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="hrintlaw" /&gt; --&gt; These include the requirement to create a national plan for family planning services, remove laws that limit access to family planning, ensure that a wide variety of safe and effective birth control methods are available including emergency contraceptives, make sure there are appropriately trained healthcare providers and facilities at an affordable price, and create a process to review the programs implemented.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="hrintlaw" /&gt; --&gt; If governments fail to do the above it may put them in breach of binding international treaty obligations.&lt;ref name="hrintlaw"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cottingham J. |author2=Germain A. |author3=Hunt P. | year = 2012 |title = Use of human rights to meet the unmet need for family planning | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 380 | issue = 9837| pages = 172–180 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60732-6 | pmid = 22784536 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the 1965 Supreme Court decision ''[[Griswold v.

Since at least the 1870s, American religious, medical, legislative, and legal commentators have debated contraception laws. Ana Garner and Angela Michel have found that in these discussions men often attach reproductive rights to moral and political matters, as part of an ongoing attempt to regulate human bodies. In press coverage between 1873–2013 they found a divide between institutional ideology and real-life experiences of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garner|first1=A. C.|last2=Michel|first2=A.

== Research directions ==

=== Females ===

Improvements of existing birth control methods are needed, as around half of those who get pregnant unintentionally are using birth control at the time.&lt;ref name=Will2012 /&gt; A number of alterations of existing contraceptive methods are being studied, including a better female condom, an improved [[SILCS diaphragm|diaphragm]], a patch containing only progestin, and a vaginal ring containing long-acting progesterone.&lt;ref name=Jensen2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jensen|first=JT|title=The future of contraception: innovations in contraceptive agents: tomorrow's hormonal contraceptive agents and their clinical implications.|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=October 2011|volume=205|issue=4 Suppl|pages=S21-5|pmid=21961821|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2011.06.055}}&lt;/ref&gt; This vaginal ring appears to be effective for three or four months and is currently available in some areas of the world.&lt;ref name=Jensen2011 /&gt; For women who rarely have sex, the taking of the hormonal birth control [[levonorgestrel]] around the time of sex looks promising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halpern|first1=V|last2=Raymond|first2=EG|last3=Lopez|first3=LM|title=Repeated use of pre- and postcoital hormonal contraception for prevention of pregnancy.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Sep 26, 2014|volume=9|pages=CD007595|pmid=25259677|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007595.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of methods to perform sterilization via the cervix are being studied.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Cast2010 /&gt; --&gt; One involves putting [[quinacrine]] in the uterus which causes scarring and infertility.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Cast2010 /&gt; --&gt; While the procedure is inexpensive and does not require surgical skills, there are concerns regarding long-term side effects.&lt;ref name=Cast2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Castaño|first=PM|author2=Adekunle, L|title=Transcervical sterilization.|journal=Seminars in reproductive medicine|date=March 2010|volume=28|issue=2|pages=103–9|pmid=20352559|doi=10.1055/s-0030-1248134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another substance, [[polidocanol]], which functions in the same manner is being looked at.&lt;ref name=Jensen2011 /&gt; A device called [[Essure]], which expands when placed in the fallopian tubes and blocks them, was approved in the United States in 2002.&lt;ref name=Cast2010 /&gt;

=== Males ===

Methods of male birth control include condoms, vasectomies and withdrawal.&lt;ref name=Glasier2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glasier|first=A|title=Acceptability of contraception for men: a review.|journal=Contraception|date=November 2010|volume=82|issue=5|pages=453–6|pmid=20933119|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2010.03.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kogan|first=P|author2=Wald, M|title=Male contraception: history and development.|journal=The Urologic clinics of North America|date=Feb 2014|volume=41|issue=1|pages=145–61|pmid=24286773|doi=10.1016/j.ucl.2013.08.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 25 and 75% of males who are sexually active would use hormonal birth control if it was available for them.&lt;ref name=Naz2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Glasier2010 /&gt; A number of hormonal and non-hormonal methods are in trials,&lt;ref name=Naz2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Naz|first=RK|author2=Rowan, S|title=Update on male contraception.|journal=Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology |date=June 2009 |volume=21 |issue=3|pages=265–9|pmid=19469045 |doi=10.1097/gco.0b013e328329247d}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is some research looking at the possibility of [[contraceptive vaccine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Naz|first=RK|title=Antisperm contraceptive vaccines: where we are and where we are going?|journal=American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)|date=July 2011|volume=66|issue=1|pages=5–12|pmid=21481057|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0897.2011.01000.x|pmc=3110624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reversible surgical method under investigation is [[reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance]] (RISUG) which consists of injecting a polymer gel, [[styrene maleic anhydride]] in [[dimethyl sulfoxide]], into the [[vas deferens]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Naz2009 /&gt; --&gt; An injection with sodium bicarbonate washes out the substance and restores fertility.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Naz2009 /&gt; --&gt; Another is an [[intravas device]] which involves putting a [[Polyurethane|urethane]] plug into the [[vas deferens]] to block it.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Naz2009 /&gt; --&gt; A combination of an [[androgen]] and a [[progestin]] seems promising, as do [[selective androgen receptor modulator]]s.&lt;ref name=Naz2009 /&gt; [[Ultrasound]] and methods to heat the testicles have undergone preliminary studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=William J.

== Other animals ==

[[Neutering]] or spaying, which involves removing some of the reproductive organs, is often carried out as a method of birth control in household pets. Many [[animal shelters]] require these procedures as part of adoption agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Millar|first=Lila|title=Infectious Disease Management in Animal Shelters|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-119-94945-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n8NbuhrrFd8C&amp;pg=PT58|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503052318/https://books.google.com/books?id=n8NbuhrrFd8C&amp;pg=PT58|archivedate=May 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In large animals the surgery is known as [[castration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Ackerman|editor-first=Lowell|title=Blackwell's five-minute veterinary practice management consult|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell Pub.|location=Ames, Iowa|isbn=978-0-7817-5984-7|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=26FZVV40aWwC&amp;pg=PA80|edition=1st|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610155134/https://books.google.com/books?id=26FZVV40aWwC&amp;pg=PA80|archivedate=June 10, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birth control is also being considered as an alternative to hunting as a means of controlling [[overpopulation in wild animals]].&lt;ref name="Boyle 2009"&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyle|first=Rebecca|date=March 3, 2009|title=Birth control for animals: a scientific approach to limiting the wildlife population explosion|work=Popular Science|location=New York|publisher=PopSci.com|url=http://www.popsci.com/environment/article/2009-03/birth-control-animals?single-page-view=true|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525182644/http://www.popsci.com/environment/article/2009-03/birth-control-animals?single-page-view=true|archivedate=May 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Contraceptive vaccine]]s have been found to be effective in a number of different animal populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=JF|author2=Lyda, RO |author3=Frank, KM |title=Contraceptive vaccines for wildlife: a review.|journal=American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)|date=July 2011|volume=66|issue=1|pages=40–50|pmid=21501279|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0897.2011.01003.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levy|first=JK|title=Contraceptive vaccines for the humane control of community cat populations.|journal=American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)|date=July 2011|volume=66|issue=1|pages=63–70|pmid=21501281|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0897.2011.01005.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenyan goat herders fix a skirt, called an [[olor]], to male goats to prevent them from impregnating female goats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Goat 'condoms' save Kenyan herds | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7648860.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 2008-10-06 | accessdate = 2008-10-06 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081006071209/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7648860.stm | archivedate = October 6, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4915">Birth [[cohort studies]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] include four long-term medical and social studies, carried out over the lives of a group of participants, from birth.  Two of these studies have continued for over 50 years.

* [[Millennium Cohort Study]] (MCS), established in 2000

==Methods and outcomes==
The studies involve repeated surveys of large numbers of individuals (typically around 17,000) from birth and throughout their lives. They have collected information on education and employment, family and parenting, physical and mental health, and social attitudes, as well as applying cognitive tests at various ages.

They are [[longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] that follow the same groups of people throughout their lives.  As such, they enable research exploring how histories of health, wealth, education, family and employment are interwoven for individuals, vary between them and affect outcomes and achievements in later life. There have been approximately 2,500 published pieces of research worldwide using the four studies according to one source [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/bibliography] and over 6,000 papers and forty books by another source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life Project|last=Pearson|first=Helen|publisher=Allen Lane an imprint of Ppenguin Books|year=2016|isbn=978-1-846-14826-2|location=UK|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Comparisons between the different generations in the four cohorts enable academics to chart social change and start to untangle the reasons behind it.  Findings from the studies have contributed to debates and enquiries in a number of policy areas over the last half-century including: education and equality of opportunity; poverty and social exclusion; gender differences in pay and employment; social class differences in health; changing family structures; and anti-social behaviour.

The studies were key sources of evidence for a number of UK Government inquiries, such as the [[Plowden Report|Plowden Committee]] on Primary Education (1967), the Warnock Committee on Children with Special Educational Needs (1978), the [[Morris Finer|Finer]] Committee on One Parent Families (1966–74), the Acheson Independent Inquiry into Inequalities in Health (1998) and the Moser Committee on Adult Basic Skills (1997–99).&lt;ref&gt;Bynner, J and Steedman, J.

[[Capital punishment]] in [[modern Greece]] was carried out using the [[guillotine]] (until 1913) or by [[firing squad]]. It was last applied in 1972, and the death penalty was abolished in stages between 1975 and 2005.

==History==
Executions during the [[Greek War of Independence]] were carried out by firing squad, although when the [[Kingdom of Greece|monarchy]] introduced the Penal Code in 1834, beheading by guillotine became the only mode of execution.&lt;ref name="Jirat-Wasiutyński2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vojtěch Jirat-Wasiutyński|title=Modern Art and the Idea of the Mediterranean|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JAvwfVf5EugC&amp;pg=PA164|year=2007|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-9170-3|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, difficulties in making the guillotine available for every execution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Athenæum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFJFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA882|year=1847|page=882}}&lt;/ref&gt; made the government establish the firing squad as an alternative mode of execution. Both would be used until the firing squad was established as the only means of execution in 1929 (the last execution by guillotine took place in 1913).

Carnitine is the generic expression for a number of compounds that include L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and propionyl-L-carnitine. It is most accumulated in cardiac and skeletal muscles as it accounts for 0.1% of its dry matter. It was first derived from meat extracts in 1905, therefore the name carnitine is derived from Latin "''carnus''" or flesh. The body synthesizes enough carnitine from lysine side chains to keep up with the needs of energy production in the body as carnitine acts as a transporter of long-chain fatty acids into the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] to be oxidized and produce energy. Some individuals with genetic or medical disorders (like preterm infants) cannot make enough, so this makes carnitine a conditionally essential nutrient for them.&lt;ref name="Rebouche_1999"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Rebouche CJ | chapter = Carnitine | title = Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease | edition = 9th | veditors = Shils ME, Olson JA, Shike M, Ross AC | publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | location = New York | year = 1999 | pages = 505–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYAS_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Preface: Carnitine: Lessons from One Hundred Years of Research | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | date = November 2004 | volume = 1033 | issue = 1 | pages = ix–xi | doi = 10.1196/annals.1320.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biosynthesis and metabolism ==
{{Main|carnitine biosynthesis}}
Many eukaryotes have the ability to synthesize carnitine, including humans. Humans synthesize carnitine from the substrate [[Methyllysine|TML]] (6-''N''-trimethyllysine), which is in turn derived from the [[methylation]] of the amino acid [[lysine]]. TML is then hydroxylated into hydroxytrimethyllysine (HTML) by [[trimethyllysine dioxygenase]], requiring the presence of [[ascorbic acid]] and iron. HTML is then cleaved by [[HTML aldose|HTML aldolase]] (a [[pyridoxal phosphate]] requiring enzyme), yielding 4-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde (TMABA) and [[glycine]]. TMABA is then [[dehydrogenated]] into gamma-butyrobetaine in an NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent reaction, catalyzed by [[TMABA dehydrogenase]]. Gamma-butyrobetaine is then hydroxylated by [[Gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase|gamma butyrobetaine hydroxylase]] (a [[zinc]] binding enzyme{{Citation needed|date=May 2018|reason=not in citation given}}) into &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-carnitine, requiring iron in the form of [[Ferrous|Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]].&lt;ref name="synthesis"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strijbis K, Vaz FM, Distel B | title = Enzymology of the carnitine biosynthesis pathway | journal = IUBMB Life | volume = 62 | issue = 5 | pages = 357–62 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20306513 | doi = 10.1002/iub.323 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Biosynthesis L-carnitine.pdf|thumb|327x327px|Carnitine Biosynthesis]]
Carnitine is involved in transporting fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane, by forming a long chain acetylcarnitine ester and being transported by [[carnitine palmitoyltransferase I]] and [[carnitine palmitoyltransferase II]].&lt;ref name="Role of carnitine in disease"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flanagan JL, Simmons PA, Vehige J, Willcox MD, Garrett Q | title = Role of carnitine in disease | journal = Nutrition &amp; Metabolism | volume = 7 | pages = 30 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20398344 | pmc = 2861661 | doi = 10.1186/1743-7075-7-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnitine also plays a role in stabilizing [[Acetyl-CoA]] and [[coenzyme A]] levels through the ability to receive or give an acetyl group.&lt;ref name="sports"/&gt;

=== Tissue distribution of carnitine-biosynthetic enzymes ===
Rebouche and Engel had investigated the tissue distribution of carnitine-biosynthetic enzymes in humans.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Rebouche, C. J. and Engel, A. G. (1980) Tissue distribution of carnitine biosynthetic enzymes in man. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 630, 22–29&lt;/ref&gt; They found TMLD to be active in the liver, heart, muscle, brain and highest in kidney. HTMLA activity is found primarily in the liver. The rate of TMABA oxidation is greatest in the liver, with considerable activity also found in the kidney, however is low in brain, heart and muscle. These results indicate that all the investigated tissues have the ability to convert TML into butyrobetaine through containing the required enzymes for it but not all of them can convert butyrobetaine into carnitine, only the kidney, liver and brain are capable of that.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Carnitine shuttle: Activation and transportation of fatty acids into the mitochondria ==
The free-floating [[fatty acid]]s, released from [[adipose tissue]]s to the blood, bind to carrier protein molecule known as [[serum albumin]] that carry the fatty acids to the [[cytoplasm]] of target cells such as the heart, skeletal muscle, and other tissue cells, where they are used for fuel. But before the target cells can use the fatty acids for ATP production and [[Beta oxidation|β oxidation]], the fatty acid with chain lengths of 14 or more carbons must be activated and subsequently transported into [[mitochondrial matrix]] of the cells in three enzymatic reactions of the carnitine shuttle'''.'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Nelson, D. L., Cox, M. M., &amp; Lehninger, A. L. (2017). ''Lehninger principles of biochemistry'' (7th ed.). New York, NY: W.H. Freeman and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reaction of the carnitine shuttle is a two-step process  catalyzed by a family of [[isozyme]]s of acyl-CoA synthetase that are found in the outer mitochondrial membrane''',''' where they promote the activation of fatty acids by forming a [[thioester]] bond between the fatty acid carboxyl group and the thiol group of coenzyme A to yield a fatty acyl–CoA.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the first step of the reaction, acyl-CoA synthetase catalyzes the transfer of [[adenosine monophosphate]] group (AMP) from an ATP molecule onto the fatty acid generating a fatty acyl–adenylate intermediate and a pyrophosphate group (PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;). The [[pyrophosphate]], formed from the hydrolysis of the two high-energy bonds in ATP, is immediately hydrolyzed to two molecule of P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; by inorganic pyro phosphatase. This reaction is highly exergonic which drives the activation reaction forward and makes it more favorable. In the second step, the [[Thiol|thiol group]] of a cytosolic [[coenzyme A]] attacks the acyl-adenylate, displacing AMP to form thioester fatty acyl-CoA.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the second reaction, the activated fatty acids that are intended for mitochondrial oxidation are transported into the matrix by a [[Membrane transport protein|carrier protein]], but first the acyl-CoA must be transiently attached to the hydroxyl group of carnitine to form fatty acyl–carnitine. This transesterification is catalyzed by an enzyme found in the outer membrane of the mitochondria known as carnitine acyltransferase 1 (also called carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, CPT1).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The fatty acyl–carnitine ester formed then diffuses across the intermembrane space of the mitochondria and enters the matrix by [[passive transport]] through the acyl-carnitine/carnitine cotransporter that is found in inner mitochondrial membrane. This [[cotransporter]] return one molecule of carnitine from the matrix to the [[Mitochondrial intermembrane space|intermembrane space]] as one molecule of fatty acyl– carnitine moves into the matrix.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the third and final reaction of the carnitine shuttle, the fatty acyl group is transferred back from fatty acyl-carnitine in the matrix to intramitochondrial coenzyme A regenerating fatty acyl–CoA and a free carnitine molecule. This reaction is catalyzed by carnitine acyltransferase 2 (also called CPT2), which is placed on the inner face of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The carnitine molecule formed is then shuttled back into the intermembrane space by the same cotransporter while the fatty acyl-CoA is oxidized and used for ATP production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Regulation of fatty acid β oxidation ==
The carnitine-mediated entry process is a rate-limiting factor for fatty acid oxidation and is an important point of regulation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Inhibition ===

The liver starts actively making [[triglyceride]]s from excess glucose when it is supplied with glucose that cannot be oxidized or stored as glycogen. This increases the concentration of [[malonyl-CoA]], the first intermediate in fatty acid synthesis, leading to the inhibition of carnitine acyltransferase 1, thereby preventing fatty acid entry into the mitochondrial matrix for [[Beta oxidation|β oxidation]]. This inhibition prevents fatty acid breakdown while synthesis is happening.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Activation ===

Carnitine activation occurs due to a need for fatty acid oxidation which is required for energy production. During vigorous muscle contraction or during fasting, ATP concentration decrease and AMP concentration increase which leads to the activation of [[AMP-activated protein kinase]] (AMPK). AMPK [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylates]] [[acetyl-CoA carboxylase]] which catalyzes malonyl-CoA synthesis. This phosphorylation inhibits the acetyl-CoA carboxylase which in turn lowers the concentration of malonyl-CoA and as a result it relieves the inhibition of fatty acyl–carnitine transport into mitochondria, thus allowing [[Beta oxidation|β oxidation]] to replenish the supply of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Transcription factors ==
[[Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha]] (PPAR''α'') is a nuclear receptor that functions as a [[transcription factor]]. It acts in muscle, adipose tissue, and liver to turn on a set of genes essential for fatty acid oxidation, including the fatty acid transporters carnitine acyltransferases 1 and 2, the fatty acyl–CoA dehydrogenases for short, medium, long, and very long acyl chains, and related enzymes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

PPAR''α'' functions as a transcription factor in two cases; as mentioned before when there is an increased demand for energy from fat catabolism, such as during a fast between meals or long-term starvation. Besides that, the transition from fetal to neonatal metabolism in the heart. In the fetus, fuel sources in heart muscle are glucose and lactate, but in the neonatal heart, fatty acids are the main fuel which require the PPAR''α'' to be activated so it is able in turn to activate the genes essential for [[fatty acid]] metabolism in this stage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Metabolic defects of fatty acids oxidation ==
More than 20 human genetic defects in [[fatty acid]] transport or [[Redox|oxidation]] have been approved. In case of [[Beta oxidation|Fatty acid oxidation]] defects, acyl-carnitines accumulate in mitochondria and are transferred into the cytosol, and then into the blood. Plasma levels of acyl-carnitine in new born infants can be detected in a small blood sample by [[tandem mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When ''β'' oxidation is defective because of either [[mutation]] or deficiency in carnitine, the ω Oxidation of Fatty Acids becomes more important in mammals. Actually, the ω Oxidation of Fatty Acids is another pathway for F-A degradation in some species of vertebrates and mammals that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum of liver and kidney, it is the oxidation of the ω (omega) carbon—the carbon most far from the carboxyl group (in contrast to &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; oxidation which occurs at the carboxyl end of [[fatty acid]], in the mitochondria).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Physiological effects ==

===Deficiency===
{{see|Systemic primary carnitine deficiency}}
There are two types of carnitine deficiency, primary and secondary carnitine deficiency. Under these circumstances there is a specific and scientific value of carnitine intake. Primary carnitine deficiency is a genetic disorder of the cellular carnitine-transporter system that typically appears by the age of five with symptoms of cardiomyopathy, skeletal-muscle weakness, and hypoglycemia. Secondary carnitine deficiencies may happen as the result of certain disorders such as chronic renal failure, or under conditions that reduce carnitine absorption or increase its excretion, for example taking antibiotics, malnutrition, and poor absorption.&lt;ref name="Rebouche_1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15591002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stanley CA | title = Carnitine deficiency disorders in children | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1033 | issue =  | pages = 42–51 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15591002 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1320.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supplementation===

Some research has been carried out on carnitine supplementation in athletes, given its role in fatty acid metabolism; however, individual responses varied significantly in the 300 people involved in one study.{{vague|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref name="sports"/&gt; Carnitine has been studied in various cardiometabolic conditions, with a bit of evidence pointing towards efficacy as an adjunct in [[heart disease]] and [[diabetes]]. However, there are insufficient trials to determine its efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mingorance C, Rodríguez-Rodríguez R, Justo ML, Alvarez de Sotomayor M, Herrera MD | title = Critical update for the clinical use of L-carnitine analogs in cardiometabolic disorders | journal = Vascular Health and Risk Management | volume = 7 | pages = 169–76 | date = 1 January 2011 | pmid = 21490942 | pmc = 3072740 | doi = 10.2147/VHRM.S14356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnitine has no effect on preventing mortality associated with cardiovascular conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shang R, Sun Z, Li H | title = Effective dosing of L-carnitine in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = BMC Cardiovascular Disorders | volume = 14 | pages = 88 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 25044037 | pmc = 4223629 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2261-14-88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnitine has no effect on serum lipids, except a possible lowering of [[LDL]].&lt;ref name="Huang_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huang H, Song L, Zhang H, Zhang H, Zhang J, Zhao W | title = Influence of L-carnitine supplementation on serum lipid profile in hemodialysis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Kidney &amp; Blood Pressure Research | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 31–41 | date = 1 January 2013 | pmid = 24525835 | doi = 10.1159/000355751 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnitine has no effect on most parameters in end stage kidney disease, however it possibly has an effect on [[c-reactive protein]]. The effects on mortality and disease outcome are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen Y, Abbate M, Tang L, Cai G, Gong Z, Wei R, Zhou J, Chen X | title = L-Carnitine supplementation for adults with end-stage kidney disease requiring maintenance hemodialysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 99 | issue = 2 | pages = 408–22 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24368434 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.113.062802 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Male infertility  ===

The carnitine content of seminal fluid is directly related to sperm count and motility, suggesting that the compound might be of value in treating male infertility. One study concluded that carnitine supplementation may improve sperm quality, and the reported benefits may relate to increased mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation (providing more energy for sperm) and reduced cell death in the testes of mice subjected to physical stress to the testes.&lt;ref name="Ng_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ng CM, Blackman MR, Wang C, Swerdloff RS | title = The role of carnitine in the male reproductive system | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1033 | issue =  | pages = 177–88 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15591015 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1320.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cardiovascular and peripheral arterial diseases ===
Several studies have approved the effectiveness of supplemental carnitine in the management of [[Ischemia|cardiac ischemia]] (restriction of blood flow to the heart) and peripheral arterial disease. In fact, levels of carnitine are low in the failing heart muscle, supplemental amounts might counteract the toxic effects of [[Fatty acid|free fatty acids]] and improve [[carbohydrate metabolism]]. Carnitine has had anti-ischemic properties when given orally and by injection.&lt;ref name="pmid15591005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferrari R, Merli E, Cicchitelli G, Mele D, Fucili A, Ceconi C | title = Therapeutic effects of L-carnitine and propionyl-L-carnitine on cardiovascular diseases: a review | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1033 | issue =  | pages = 79–91 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15591005 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1320.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15591006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hiatt WR | title = Carnitine and peripheral arterial disease | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1033 | issue =  | pages = 92–8 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15591006 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1320.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atherosclerosis===

An important interaction between diet and the intestinal microbiome brings into play additional metabolic factors that aggravate atherosclerosis beyond dietary cholesterol. This may help to explain some benefits of the Mediterranean diet. Hazen’s group from the Cleveland Clinic reported that carnitine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koeth RA, Wang Z, Levison BS, Buffa JA, Org E, Sheehy BT, Britt EB, Fu X, Wu Y, Li L, Smith JD, DiDonato JA, Chen J, Li H, Wu GD, Lewis JD, Warrier M, Brown JM, Krauss RM, Tang WH, Bushman FD, Lusis AJ, Hazen SL | title = Intestinal microbiota metabolism of L-carnitine, a nutrient in red meat, promotes atherosclerosis | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 576–85 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23563705 | pmc = 3650111 | doi = 10.1038/nm.3145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from animal flesh (four times as much in red meat as in fish or chicken), as well as phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk, are converted by intestinal bacteria to trimethylamine (the compound that causes uremic breath to smell fishy). Trimethylamine is oxidized in the liver to [[trimethylamine N-oxide|trimethylamine ''N''-oxide]] (TMAO), which causes atherosclerosis in animal models. Patients in the top quartile of TMAO had a 2.5-fold increase in the 3-year risk of stroke, death, or myocardial infarction.

A key issue is that vegans who consumed &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-carnitine did not produce TMAO because they did not have the intestinal bacteria that produce TMA from carnitine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spence JD | title = Recent advances in pathogenesis, assessment, and treatment of atherosclerosis | journal = F1000Research | volume = 5 | pages = 1880 | date = 28 Jul 2016 | pmid = 27540477 | pmc = 4965699 | doi = 10.12688/f1000research.8459.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cancer ===
[[Chemotherapy]] and [[Radiation therapy|radiation treatment]] adverse effects such as fatigue, mood and sleep disturbances, are common in cancer patients. A deficiency in carnitine may also occur, some studies were done on cancer patients with deficiency of carnitine. Carnitine supplementation have showed normal blood levels of carnitine, enhancement in mood and sleep, and relieving of the fatigue caused by chemotherapy. However, a 2018 meta-analysis found little evidence to support the use of carnitine for cancer-related fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marx W, Teleni L, Opie RS, Kelly J, Marshall S, Itsiopoulos C, Isenring E | title = Efficacy and Effectiveness of Carnitine Supplementation for Cancer-Related Fatigue: A Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis | journal = Nutrients | volume = 9 | issue = 11 | pages = 1224 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29112178 | pmc = 5707696 | doi = 10.3390/nu9111224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnitine may be depleted in some cancer chemotherapy treatments. There is weak evidence from clinical trials that carnitine supplementation may be beneficial in treating cancer [[anorexia-cachexia syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Gröber_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gröber U, Holzhauer P, Kisters K, Holick MF, Adamietz IA | title = Micronutrients in Oncological Intervention | journal = Nutrients | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 163 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26985904 | pmc = 4808891 | doi = 10.3390/nu8030163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diabetes mellitus type 2 ===
[[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 diabetes]] which is marked by [[insulin]] resistance may be associated with a defect in [[Beta oxidation|fatty acid oxidation]] in muscle. Several studies suggest that carnitine supplementation may have a beneficial effect on glucose utilization and reduce [[diabetic neuropathy]]. However carnitine may also increase overall cardio-metabolic risk.&lt;ref name="Bene_2018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bene J, Hadzsiev K, Melegh B | title = Role of carnitine and its derivatives in the development and management of type 2 diabetes | journal = Nutrition &amp; Diabetes | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 8 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29549241 | pmc = 5856836 | doi = 10.1038/s41387-018-0017-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AIDS and HIV ===
Generally [[HIV]] infected patients accumulate fat in some areas of the body and lose fat in other areas, besides having high blood levels of fats ([[hyperlipidemia]]) and [[insulin resistance]] which is known as the lipdystrophy syndrome. This syndrome causes a deficiency in L- carnitine which causes defects in [[Lipid metabolism|fat metabolism]] in mitochondria.&lt;ref name="Day_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Day L, Shikuma C, Gerschenson M | title = Acetyl-L-carnitine for the treatment of HIV lipoatrophy | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1033 | issue =  | pages = 139–46 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15591011 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1320.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supplementation with carnitine in HIV-infected individuals may slow the death of lymphocytes, reduce [[neuropathy]] and favorably affect blood lipid levels.&lt;ref name="Day_2004" /&gt;[[File:Plugged into dialysis.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Hemodialysis]]

=== End stage renal disease and Hemodialysis ===
The kidneys contribute to overall [[homeostasis]] in the body, including carnitine levels. In the case of [[Kidney failure|renal impairment]], urinary elimination of carnitine increasing, endogenous synthesis decreasing, and poor nutrition as a result of disease-induced anorexia can result in carnitine deficiency. Carnitine blood levels and muscle stores can become very low, which may contribute to [[anemia]], muscle weakness, fatigue, altered levels of blood fats, and heart disorders. Some studies have shown that supplementation of high doses of L-carnitine (often injected) may aid in [[anemia]] management.&lt;ref name="pmid15591003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Calvani M, Benatti P, Mancinelli A, D'Iddio S, Giordano V, Koverech A, Amato A, Brass EP | title = Carnitine replacement in end-stage renal disease and hemodialysis | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1033 | issue =  | pages = 52–66 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15591003 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1320.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11856775"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hurot JM, Cucherat M, Haugh M, Fouque D | title = Effects of L-carnitine supplementation in maintenance hemodialysis patients: a systematic review | journal = Journal of the American Society of Nephrology | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 708–14 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11856775 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartinine is a [[Chirality|chiral]] molecule, meaning that it exists as two [[isomer]]s (L-carnitine and D-carnitine), each of which is a mirror image of the other. The form present in the body is L-carnitine, which is also the form present in food. Food sources rich in L-carnitine are animal products such as meat, poultry, fish, and milk. Redder meats tend to have higher levels of L-carnitine.&lt;ref name="Rebouche_1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huang_2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;National Research Council. Food and Nutrition Board. Recommended Dietary Allowances, 10th Edition. National Academy Press, Washington, DC, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Adults eating diverse diets that contain animal products attain about 60–180 milligrams of carnitine per day.&lt;ref name="Rebouche_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rebouche CJ | title = Kinetics, pharmacokinetics, and regulation of L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine metabolism | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1033 | issue =  | pages = 30–41 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15591001 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1320.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vegans get noticeably less (about 10–12 milligrams) since their diets lack these carnitine-rich animal-derived foods. Approximately 54% to 86% of dietary carnitine is absorbed in the small intestine and then enters the bloodstream.&lt;ref name="Rebouche_2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rebouche_1999" /&gt; Even carnitine-poor diets have little effect on the body’s total carnitine content as the kidneys conserve carnitine very efficiently.&lt;ref name="Rebouche_1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huang_2013" /&gt; The carnitine content of several foods is listed in Table 1.

In general omnivorous humans consume 2–12 µmol of carnitine per day per kg of body weight that forms 75% of body carnitine. Humans produce 1.2 µmol per day per kg of body weight of carnitine endogenously which is 25% of body carnitine.&lt;ref&gt;Rebouche, C. J.

(1996) Characterization of the human plasmalemmal carnitine transporter in cultured skin fibroblasts. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 329, 145–155&lt;/ref&gt; Strict vegetarians obtain very little of carnitine from diet (0.1 µmol per day per kg of body weight) as carnitine is mainly found in foods coming from animals. This means that 90% of their body carnitine is obtained through biosynthesis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However this difference of plasma levels of carnitine between omnivorous humans and strict vegetarians is possibly not of any clinical significance.&lt;ref&gt;Lombard, K. A., Olson, A. L., Nelson, S. E. and Rebouche, C. J. (1989) Carnitine status of lactoovovegetarians and strict vegetarian adults and children. Am. J. Clin.

Physiol. Res. 49, 399–402&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recommended intakes of carnitine ===
In 1989, the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) concluded that carnitine wasn't an essential nutrient as healthy human liver and kidneys synthesize sufficient quantities of carnitine from lysine and methionine to meet up with daily body requirements without the need of consuming it from supplements or food.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rebouche_1999" /&gt; Also, the FNB has not established Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for carnitine.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine. Food and Nutrition Board. Dietary Reference Intakes. 2005. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iom.edu/project.asp?id=4574&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supplemental sources of carnitine ===
L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and propionyl-L-carnitine are available in [[nutraceutical]] [[dietary supplement]] pills or powders. It is also a drug approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] to treat primary and certain secondary carnitine-deficiency syndromes.&lt;ref name = "NYAS_2004" /&gt;

== Carnitine and medication interactions ==
1. Carnitine interacts with '''[[Pivalic acid|pivalate]]'''-conjugated antibiotics such as [[pivampicillin]]. Chronic administration of these antibiotics increases the excretion of pivaloyl-carnitine, which can lead to '''carnitine depletion'''.&lt;ref name="Rebouche_1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rebouche_2004" /&gt;

2. Treatment with the [[anticonvulsant]]s '''[[valproic acid]], [[phenobarbital]], [[phenytoin]], or [[carbamazepine]]''' significantly reduces blood levels of carnitine. In addition, the use of [[valproic acid]] may cause [[hepatotoxicity]]. (L-carnitine administration may help treat [[valproic acid]] toxicity in children and adults)&lt;ref name="pmid1941389"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hug G, McGraw CA, Bates SR, Landrigan EA | title = Reduction of serum carnitine concentrations during anticonvulsant therapy with phenobarbital, valproic acid, phenytoin, and carbamazepine in children | journal = The Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 119 | issue = 5 | pages = 799–802 | date = November 1991 | pmid = 1941389 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19280426"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lheureux PE, Hantson P | title = Carnitine in the treatment of valproic acid-induced toxicity | journal = Clinical Toxicology | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 101–11 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19280426 | doi = 10.1080/15563650902752376 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Levocarnitine was approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] as a [[New chemical entity|new molecular entity]] under the brand name Carnitor on December 27, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/pre96/018948a_s016_071492.pdf FDA approval letter]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], a '''certified nurse-midwife''' ('''CNM''') is a [[midwife]] who exceeds the [[International Confederation of Midwives]] essential [[Competence (human resources)|competencies]] for a midwife and is also an [[advanced practice registered nurse]] having completed registered nursing and midwifery education. CNMs provide [[Women's health|care of women]] across their lifespan, including [[pregnancy]] and the [[postpartum period]], and [[Preventive healthcare|well woman care]] and [[birth control]]. Certified nurse midwives are exceptionally recognized by the International Confederation of Midwives as a type of [[midwives in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Become a midwife|url=http://www.midwife.org/Become-a-Midwife|publisher=American College of Nurse-Midwives|accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   |title= Midwives Associations Worldwide   |url= http://www.internationalmidwives.org/our-members/   |publisher= International Confederation of Midwives   |accessdate= May 22, 2016   |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180113150313/http://internationalmidwives.org/our-members/#   |archive-date= 2018-01-13   |dead-url= yes   |df=    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and training ==

The American College of Nurse-Midwives accredits [[midwifery]] education programs and serves as the national specialty society for the nation's CNMs and Certified Midwives (CMs). CNMs in most states are required to 
* possess a minimum of a [[Postgraduate education|graduate degree]], such as the [[Master of Science in Nursing]] or Master of Science in Midwifery or a Doctorate of Nursing Practice or a Doctorate in Midwifery. 
* pass the [[NCLEX]] examination to become a [[registered nurse]]. 
* pass the American Midwifery Certification Board exam.
* hold a [[Professional licensure in the United States|state license]] to practice midwifery or nurse-midwifery.
* keep up to date on latest knowledge as pertains to their field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploring the Spectrum|url=http://onlinenursingdegrees.maryville.edu/resource/infographics/exploring-the-spectrum/|website=Maryville University St. Louis Online Nurse Practitioner Programs|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
CNMs function as primary healthcare providers for women and most often provide medical care for relatively healthy women, whose health and births are considered uncomplicated and not "[[High-risk pregnancy|high risk]]," as well as their neonates. Often, women with high risk pregnancies can receive the benefits of midwifery care from a CNM in collaboration with a [[physician]]. CNMs may work closely or in collaboration with an [[obstetrician &amp; gynecologist]], who provides consultation and/or assistance to patients who develop [[Complications of pregnancy|complications]] or have complex [[Medical history|medical histories]] or disease(s). CNMs provide health care for [[Reproductive health|sexual health]], as they also see women for routine exams and are able to initiate all types of contraception.

CNMs practice in [[hospital]]s and private practice medical [[clinic]]s and may also deliver babies in [[birthing centers]] and attend [[Home birth|at-home births]]. Some work with academic institutions as [[Professor|professors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Role of a Certified Nurse Midwife|url=http://nursingonline.uc.edu/the-role-of-a-certified-nurse-midwife/|website=University of Cincinnati Online Master of Science in Nursing}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are able to [[medical prescription|prescribe]] medications, treatments, medical devices, therapeutic and diagnostic measures. CNMs are able to provide medical care to women from [[puberty]] through [[menopause]], including care for their newborn ([[neonatology]]), antepartum, intrapartum, [[postpartum]] and nonsurgical gynecological care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=18.4.

In the United States, fewer than 1% of nurse midwives are men.&lt;ref name="Pilkenton 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Midwifery: A career for men in nursing |last = Pilkenton |first = Deanna |last2 = Schorn|first2 = Mavis N |date = February 2008 |journal = Men In Nursing}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Childbirth in Ghana''' is often seen as a joyous occasion in [[Ghana]]ian society, as children represent wealth, status, and the continuation of a lineage. Pregnant women are often given special privileges and are considered to be beautiful, fragile, and vulnerable to evil spirits. Therefore, women may seek guidance from a religious or spiritual diviner to protect their fetus or to increase their chances of conceiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salm|first1=Steven J.|last2=Falola|first2=Toyin|title=Culture and Customs of Ghana|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-313-32050-0|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Akan people|Akan]] may carry ''[[akuaba]]'' dolls, a fertility symbol, during pregnancy to ensure that they will birth a healthy and beautiful baby that resembles the doll's exaggerated features.&lt;ref&gt;Culture and Customs of Ghana, page 128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infertility==

Due to the cultural implications and the importance of bearing children, [[infertility]] in Ghana can be devastating. Throughout the years, Ghanaians have believed that both physical and spiritual ailments are the cause of infertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Michelle|title=Childbearing in Ghana: How beliefs affect care|journal=African Diaspora ISPs|date=2002|issue=Paper 76|url=http://digitalcollections.sit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1041&amp;context=african_diaspora_isp|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people believe that a womb could be too hot or too cold to support a developing baby. Others believe that the cause of their infertility is witchcraft, and this belief is often supported by traditional priests who assert that the woman can be rid of a witch's curse and be allowed to conceive if the priest performs a rite in which he asks fertility gods how they can be appeased.&lt;ref&gt;Childbearing in Ghana: How beliefs affect care&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other spiritual beliefs involving infertility include the belief that infertility is the result of a woman's disobedience to God, in which the remedy is prayer and repentance.&lt;ref&gt;Childbearing in Ghana: How beliefs affect care&lt;/ref&gt; Women who consult a tradition birth attendant are likely to be told that prayer is the medicine for infertility, although they acknowledge that infertility is sometimes caused by a physical ailment. In these cases, the traditional birth attendant may blame the infertility on stomach aches and advise the woman to visit a hospital and take the medicine given by the doctor.&lt;ref&gt;Childbearing in Ghana: How beliefs affect care&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prenatal care==

Cultural influences and sociodemographic characteristics play an important role in a woman's decision to seek maternal-child health services. These influences and characteristics include level of education, religious affiliation, region of residence, ethnicity, and occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ADDAI|first1=Isaac|title=Determinants of use of maternal-child health services in rural ghana|journal=Journal of Biosocial Science|date=2000|volume=32|issue=01|pages=1–15|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0021932000000018|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most communities, maternal-child health services coexist with traditional indigenous health care, and pregnant women in these rural areas may choose between modern medicine, herbalists, diviners, and spiritualists for care.&lt;ref&gt;Determinants of use of maternal-child health services in rural ghana, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a doctor for prenatal care is low among women living in rural areas of Greater Accra and the Northern and Upper regions of Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;Determinants of use of maternal-child health services in rural ghana, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; 23.1% of Protestant and Catholic women, and 10.3% of traditional women consult a doctor for prenatal care.&lt;ref&gt;Determinants of use of maternal-child health services in rural ghana, page 5-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of women believe that antenatal care from a health professional is necessary to determine that their pregnancy is normal, to see that the fetus is well-positioned, to learn about when they were expected to deliver, to obtain a tetanus immunization, for the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses during pregnancy, and nutritional advice. The barriers to seeking antenatal care include travel time and distance from health care facilities, the high cost, and the inconvenient hours of operations of the clinics. Some women also did not want people to know they were pregnant until their third month of pregnancy, and would wait until then to seek antenatal care.&lt;ref&gt;Users of Health Professionals for Obstetric Care in Northern Ghana, page 51&lt;/ref&gt; Inexpensive care from traditional birth attendants included routine antenatal care, however untrained attendants and traditional healers did not provide antenatal care.&lt;ref&gt;Users of Health Professionals for Obstetric Care in Northern Ghana, page 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pregnancy food beliefs and practices==

Knowledge about nutrition in Ghana is obtained through formal education, community health services, friends and families, cultural practices, traditions, and beliefs of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de-Graft Aikins |first1=Ama |title=Food Beliefs and Practices During Pregnancy in Ghana: Implications for Maternal Health Interventions |journal=Health Care for Women International |date=2014 |volume=35 |pages=954–972 |doi=10.1080/07399332.2014.926902 |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07399332.2014.926902 |accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of foods consumed by Ghanaian women during pregnancy were foods indigenous to Ghanaian diets in general such as green leafy vegetables, meats, fish, fruits, and legumes. They also consume foreign foods such as dairy products, biscuits, and beverages such as tea and powdered mixes.&lt;ref&gt;Food Beliefs and Practices During Pregnancy in Ghana: Implications for Maternal Health Interventions, page 960&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recommended raw foods during pregnancy include: bananas, oranges, papaya, pineapples, carrots, cabbage, lettuce, honey, and kwawu nsua/nsaman troba. Recommended cooked foods include bean stew with palm oil and boiled white rice, bread, fried anchovies, smoked mackerel, snails in soup, stews with eggs and vegetables, palm nut soup with fufu and rice, and Nkontomire stew which is made with palm oil and boiled sweet cassava, or plantain, or yam.&lt;ref&gt;Food Beliefs and Practices During Pregnancy in Ghana: Implications for Maternal Health Interventions, Table 2&lt;/ref&gt; The beliefs about beneficial foods during pregnancy are based on their understanding of how certain foods can prevent anemia, enhance physical strength, support the development of the fetus, and minimize physiological disruption.&lt;ref&gt;Food Beliefs and Practices During Pregnancy in Ghana: Implications for Maternal Health Interventions, page 963&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in Ghana also believe there are foods one must avoid during pregnancy. Most women agree that excess fat and sugar are harmful during pregnancy, and Fante and Akwapim women have beliefs about specific foods to avoid which include sugarcane, coconut, oranges, pineapple, chilli pepper, ground nut soup, eggs, high fat and high sugar foods, cooking oils, salt, and clay.&lt;ref&gt;Food Beliefs and Practices During Pregnancy in Ghana: Implications for Maternal Health Interventions, Table 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abortion and contraceptive use==

In 1985, the abortion law passed in Ghana allowed for legal and safe abortion by a qualified medical practitioner for pregnancies that resulted from rape or incest, if the pregnancy threatens the life of the woman or her physical or mental health, or if there is substantial risk that the fetus would suffer from a serious physical anomaly or devastating disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sedgh|first1=Gilda|title=Abortion in Ghana|journal=In Brief|date=July 2010|issue=2|pages=1–4|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/IB-Abortion-in-Ghana.pdf|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many women in Ghana are not aware that abortion is legal in their country and tend to seek unsafe abortion providers and receive unsafe care afterwards. As a result, more than 11% of maternal deaths are due to unsafe abortions, making it the second most common death in women in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;Abortion in Ghana, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the 2007 Ghana Maternal Health Survey (GMHS), 7% of all pregnancies end in abortion. The incidences of abortion are higher in women who are 20–24 years old, educated and wealthy women, and women who live in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;Abortion in Ghana, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; Contraceptive use is low in Ghana with about 24% of women using contraceptives in 2008. 35% Of married women in Ghana are in need of contraceptives, but are not using any&lt;ref&gt;Abortion in Ghana, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labor==

===Traditional Beliefs About Labor===
People believed that women who were not faithful to their husbands would experience prolonged labor, and male traditional healers would remark that a promiscuous woman would have to tell every person in the room the number of men she has slept with apart from her husband before she would be able to give birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mills|first1=Samuel|last2=Bertrand|first2=Jane T.|title=Use of Health Professionals for Obstetric Care in Northern Ghana|journal=Studies in Family Planning|date=2005|volume=36|issue=1|pages=45–56|jstor=4148936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other traditional beliefs and practices related to laboring women included special herbs being used when the umbilical cord was wrapped around the neck of the fetus and for breech presentations, hot water poured on the abdomen and okra smeared on the vagina to expedite delivery, women who could not birth the placenta were given a bottle to blow into in order to force the placenta out, and a calabash of hot water was placed on the abdomen to stop postpartum hemorrhage and bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;Use of Health Professionals for Obstetric Care in Northern Ghana, page 48&lt;/ref&gt; Although many people have extensive knowledge of these traditional beliefs and practices, many indicate that most people no longer use them.&lt;ref&gt;Use of Health Professionals for Obstetric Care in Northern Ghana, page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth==
Most deliveries in Ghana are attended by untrained personnel, including traditional birth attendants, and most traditional birth attendants in rural areas are illiterate elderly farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ampofo|first1=DA|last2=Nicholas|first2=DD|last3=Amonoo-Acquah|first3=MB|last4=Ofosu-Amaah|first4=S|last5=Neuman|first5=AK|title=The training of traditional birth attendants in Ghana:experience of the Danfa Rural Health Project|journal=Tropical Geographical Medicine|date=1977|volume=29|issue=2|pages=197–203|pmid=906080}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Users of Health Professionals for Obstetric Care in Northern Ghana, page52&lt;/ref&gt;
Many women choose traditional birth attendants because of the lower cost, and because they live in the community and are able to assist quickly. They are known to assist with bathing the newborn, and giving advice on breastfeeding and newborn care. Traditional birth attendants deliver in cases on uncomplicated labor and are able to refer women to health care facilities when complications arise.&lt;ref&gt;Users of Health Professionals for Obstetric Care in Northern Ghana, page 53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Place of delivery===
The majority of Ghanaian women deliver at home with a traditional birth attendant and are referred to the hospital in cases of complicated labor. Although most deliveries are attended by a traditional birth attendant, most women prefer to deliver with a health professional. Barriers to obtaining professional health care include high costs, inadequate transportation, long distances to health care facilities, and poor road conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Users of Health Professionals for Obstetric Care in Northern Ghana, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; Some women were also too embarrassed to go to a hospital because they did not have nice clothes and preferred to deliver at home where no one could see that they were poor.&lt;ref&gt;Users of Health Professionals for Obstetric Care in Northern Ghana, page 51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision-making===
In general, men have most of the decision-making power in Ghanaian society.&lt;ref&gt;Culture and Customs of Ghana, page 140&lt;/ref&gt; In labor and delivery, husbands and heads of the households also make most of the decisions in collaboration with the birth attendant, and sometimes a soothsayer.&lt;ref&gt;Users of Health Professionals for Obstetric Care in Northern Ghana, page 49&lt;/ref&gt; During labor, the husband will usually make the decision about where to deliver because a woman in labor is considered unable to think clearly due to the pain, although the head of the household will have the final say.&lt;ref&gt;Users of Health Professionals for Obstetric Care in Northern Ghana, page 49&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, women, especially those who can afford to go to a hospital, will make their own decision about where to give birth without waiting for the approval of their husband or household heads.&lt;ref&gt;Users of Health Professionals for Obstetric Care in Northern Ghana, page 50&lt;/ref&gt;

===Placenta===
Traditionally, the placenta has been buried outside of the house to show that the ancestors of the family has accepted the baby.&lt;ref&gt;Users of Health Professionals for Obstetric Care in Northern Ghana, page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postpartum==
The older women in the compound or community look after women in their [[postpartum period]] and assist with cleaning the baby and massage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tagoe-Darko |first1=Eva |last2=Mohamed Gyasi |first2=Razak |title=Traditional Teachings and Practices for Child Health in Ghana |journal=Research on Humanities and Social Sciences |date=2013 |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=93 in pages 90–95 |url=https://www.academia.edu/3822264/Traditional_Teachings_and_Practices_for_Child_Health_in_Ghana |accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers receive postpartum teaching from the older women in the community. In the early postpartum period, there is great emphasis placed on the health and well-being of the mother and infant. Breastfeeding and postpartum abstinence is mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;Traditional Teachings and Practices for Child Health in Ghana, page 93&lt;/ref&gt; Both mother and baby receive massages using shea-butter, palm kernel oil, and other oils. During this time, different colored and sized beads are tied around the wrist, waist, and ankles to monitor the growth of the infant. Older women will also keep a brass bowl full of herbs, mixtures, white clay, soft sponge, and charcoal. These items are believed to prevent health problems for the infant and mother.&lt;ref&gt;Traditional Teachings and Practices for Child Health in Ghana, page 93&lt;/ref&gt;

==Care of the newborn==
When babies are born, they are kept indoors for seven days because Ghanaians believe that this is the period in which they are most vulnerable to both physical and spiritual harm.&lt;ref&gt;Culture and Customs of Ghana, page 128&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, it is believed that the child is wandering between the spiritual and physical world and may decide to go back to the spiritual world at any point. They are known as strangers until the end of the seven days when they are acknowledged and welcomed into society with an elaborate naming ceremony, or outdooring ceremony.

===Outdooring ceremony===
Outdooring ceremonies can vary in practice among the different Ghanaian ethnic groups. The [[Ga people|Ga]] place drops of water and alcohol onto the child's tongue to symbolize teaching them the difference between good and evil, and they may also place a piece of food such as [[kenkey]] so the child will appreciate a staple food of the Ga.&lt;ref&gt;Culture and Customs of Ghana, page 128&lt;/ref&gt; Some groups practice raising the baby toward the sky three times to introduce them to heaven and Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Culture and Customs of Ghana, page 128&lt;/ref&gt; 

Libations are also poured and live sacrifices of chickens or goats are made to ensure good health and protect the child from evil.&lt;ref&gt;Culture and Customs of Ghana, page 128&lt;/ref&gt; The father or an elder will call out the child's name for the guests to repeat aloud to formally welcome the child into the community. After the naming concludes, friends and relatives give gifts to the family, and feasting and dancing follows.&lt;ref&gt;Culture and Customs of Ghana, page 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional names are often based on the day of the week the baby was born, the gender of the baby, and their relationship to the other children in the family. Christian families will often give their children a traditional name and a Christian name.&lt;ref&gt;Culture and Customs of Ghana, page 128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circumcision===
In the past, boys in Ghanaian society often do not undergo [[circumcision]] as an infant. Boys will receive circumcision as they undergo initiation into adulthood at the age of ten to fourteen years of age.&lt;ref&gt;Culture and Customs of Ghana, page 129&lt;/ref&gt; Ghanaians believe that the circumcision represents cleanliness and the pain will make the boys physically and mentally stronger.&lt;ref&gt;Culture and Customs of Ghana, page 129&lt;/ref&gt;
With the advent of modern medicine however,  male children are circumcised from as early as four (4) days after they are born, and this is normally done at the hospitals or locally by Wanzams, special men trained in circumcision.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4055">'''Collection of unused drugs''', also called '''drug return''' or '''drug take-back''', is any program for individual consumers to [[drug disposal|dispose of drugs]] by returning their [[unused drugs]] to a collection center.

One survey of consumers found that individuals like the idea of pharmacies accepting drug returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thach|first1=Andrew V.|last2=Brown|first2=Carolyn M.|last3=Pope|first3=Nathan|title=Consumer perceptions about a community pharmacy-based medication take back program|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|date=September 2013|volume=127|pages=23–27|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.04.025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005''' ('''CMEA''') is federal legislation enacted in the [[United States]] on March 9, 2006, to regulate, among other things, retail over-the-counter sales of following products because of their use in the manufacture of illegal drugs:
*[[ephedrine]]
*[[pseudoephedrine]]
*[[phenylpropanolamine]] (no longer OTC due to a proposed increased risk of stroke in younger women)
Retail provisions of the CMEA include daily sales limits and 30-day purchase limits, placement of product out of direct customer access, sales logbooks, customer ID verification, employee training, and self-certification of regulated sellers. The CMEA is found as Title VII of the [[USA PATRIOT Act|USA PATRIOT]] Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 (H.R. 3199).&lt;ref name="dea"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/meth/q_a.htm|title=The Combat Meth Act of 2005: Assessment of Annual Needs - Questions and Answers|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, Office of Diversion Control|accessdate=2007-04-12| date=2006-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last provisions of the law took effect on 30 September 2006.

==Justification==
Ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine are precursor chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of [[methamphetamine]] or [[amphetamine]]. They are also common ingredients used to make cough, cold, and allergy products. It was argued that the CMEA would curtail the [[clandestine chemistry|clandestine]] production of methamphetamine. The [[U.S. Department of Justice]] claims that states that have enacted similar or more restrictive retail regulations have seen a dramatic drop in small clandestine labs.&lt;ref name="dea"/&gt;

==Provisions==
"The CMEA requires record-keeping and identification of all sales and reports to law enforcement of any 'suspicious' transactions. Purchasers are limited to '3.6 grams of pseudoephedrine base' per day and 9 grams per month. (Buying more than that is a federal misdemeanor.)"&lt;ref name=Roots&gt;Roots, Roger (2011-04-05) [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig8/roots6.1.1.html Cooking Meth: How Government Manufactured a Drug Epidemic], ''[[LewRockwell.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The statute also includes the following requirements for merchants who sell these products:
*A retrievable record of all purchases identifying the name and address of each party to be kept for two years
*Required verification of proof of identity of all purchasers
*Required protection and disclosure methods in the collection of personal information
*Reports to the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] of any suspicious payments or disappearances of the regulated products
*Required training of employees with regard to the requirements of the CMEA; Retailer must self-certify as to training and compliance
*Non-liquid dose form of regulated product may only be sold in unit dose blister packs
*Regulated products are to be sold behind the counter or in a locked cabinet in such a way as to restrict public access
*Daily sales of regulated products not to exceed 3.6 grams without regard to the number of transactions
*30 day (not monthly) sales limit not to exceed 7.5 grams if sold by mail-order or "mobile retail vendor"
*30 day purchase limit not to exceed 9 grams of pseudoephedrine base in regulated products (misdemeanor possession offense under 21 USC 844a for the individual who buys it)
* Prescriptions are exempt from logbook requirements.

==First arrest==
In September 2006, Tim Naveau was arrested and charged with a Class-B [[misdemeanor]] for purchasing [[Pseudoephedrine/loratadine|Claritin-D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Radley|last=Balko|title=Man Arrested For Allergies|url=http://www.reason.com/blog/show/117494.html|publisher=Reason Magazine|date= 2006-12-24 |accessdate=2008-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naveau takes one tablet of Claritin D each day to combat allergies, and he "had stocked up on the allergy medication because his teenage son, who was also an allergy sufferer, needed several packages because he was headed off to a church camp."&lt;ref name=Roots/&gt; Minors are not permitted to purchase pseudoephedrine under the law.

'''''Dead Ringers''''' is a 1988 Canadian-American [[Psychological horror|psychological horror film]] starring [[Jeremy Irons]] in a dual role as identical twin gynecologists. [[David Cronenberg]] directed and co-wrote the screenplay with [[Norman Snider]]. Their script was based on the lives of [[Stewart and Cyril Marcus]] and on the novel ''Twins'' by [[Bari Wood]] and Jack Geasland, a "highly fictionalized" version of the Marcus' story.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/02/arts/film-view.html |last=Maslin|first= Janet|title="Ringers": the Eerier, the Better | newspaper =[[The New York Times]]|date= October 2, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 [[10th Genie Awards|Genie Awards]], notably [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]]. [[Toronto International Film Festival]] critics have ranked it among the [[Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time]].

==Plot==
Elliot and Beverly Mantle are [[identical twin]]s and [[Gynecology|gynecologists]] who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in the treatment of female fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly, while the women remain unaware of the substitution.

An actress, Claire Niveau, comes to the clinic for her infertility. It turns out that Claire has a "trifurcated cervix", which means she probably will not be able to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. However, Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's [[Prescription drug abuse|abuse of prescription drugs]], which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a bar, but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.

Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film. This sends Beverly into [[clinical depression]], more prescription drug abuse, and paranoid [[Stimulant psychosis|delusions]] about "mutant women" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out [[Metallurgy|metallurgical]] artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre "gynecological instruments" for operating on these mutant women. After Beverly assaults a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.

With their medical career now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly into the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to "synchronize" their bloodstreams. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he is concerned about his brother, and goes back to the clinic. There he finds the clinic in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions are reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed, "to separate the Siamese twins". Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination couch with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he had used to assault his patient in the operating room.

Shortly after, Beverly pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks, "Who is this?", Beverly leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and lies in Elliot's dead arms.

==Production==
[[File:Jeremy Irons.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Jeremy Irons]] played the two roles of Bev and Elliot Mantle.]]
Although ''Dead Ringers'' closely follows the case of [[Stewart and Cyril Marcus]], director [[Peter Greenaway]] notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film ''[[A Zed &amp; Two Noughts]]'' for two hours before going on to make ''Dead Ringers'' eight months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plasmapool.50webs.com/interview/200410-greenaway.html|title=October 2004 - Online Q&amp;A with director Peter Greenaway|publisher=The Plasma Pool|accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[Audio commentary|DVD commentary]], Irons claims that [[Robert De Niro]] declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while [[William Hurt]] decided to reject the parts because "it is hard enough to play one role".&lt;ref name="Dead Ringers Review"&gt;{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Mcgue |url=http://www.alifeatthemovies.com/dead-ringers/ |title=Dead Ringers Review |date=October 7, 2010 |work=A Life At The Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movie marked the screen debut of actress [[Jill Hennessy]]: both she and her real life twin sister Jacqueline play prostitutes in one scene of the film. Jill later followed this film up with her signature role as Claire Kincaid on the TV series  ''[[Law &amp; Order]]''.

Irons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said "the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which," he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an "internal way" to portray each character, employing the [[Alexander technique]] for "different energy points," giving each character his own appearance.&lt;ref name="Dead Ringers Review"/&gt;

A second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly’s stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=prEUHH2jcWAC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=dead+ringers+parasite+twin+scene&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5JQDSMYcR1&amp;sig=zTTs_PmZf9Tj41cVC--56h5ozHM&amp;hl=cs&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_yPe61OvLAhXlFZoKHcDFCdsQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=dead%20ringers%20parasite%20twin%20scene&amp;f=false | title=David Cronenberg: Author or Filmmaker? | last=Browning | first=Mark | publisher=Intellect | year=2007 | isbn=9781841501734 | page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two and a half stars, writing "it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dead-ringers-1988 |title=Dead Ringers |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=23 September 1988  |accessdate=12 April 2017 |work=Rogerebert.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said Irons portrayed his characters with skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1987/film/reviews/dead-ringers-1200427608/ |title=Review: 'Dead Ringers' |last=Variety Staff |first= |date=31 December 1987  |accessdate=12 April 2017 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Desson Howe]] assessed it as "unnerving but also enthralling".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/deadringersrhowe_a0b1c2.htm |title=Dead Ringers |last=Howe |first=Desson |date=23 September 1988 |accessdate=12 April 2017 |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it "every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller", adding it was "like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/deadringersrkempley_a0c9ec.htm |title=Dead Ringers |last=Kempley 
|first=Rita |date=23 September 1988 |accessdate=12 April 2017 |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has a positive rating of 82% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 39 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dead_ringers/ |title=Dead Ringers (1988) |last= |first= |date= |accessdate=8 December 2017 |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director [[Chan-wook Park]]&lt;ref name="nyfl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jigsawlounge.co.uk/film/parkchanwookinterview.html |last=Neil Young's Film Lounge|title=Park Life|date= 2004-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was voted for in the 2002 ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' poll by Lalitha Gopalan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/voter.php?forename=Lalitha&amp;surname=Gopalan BFI | Sight &amp; Sound | Top Ten Poll 2002 - How the directors and critics voted&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' listed ''Dead Ringers'' as 95th on their list of "100 Maverick Movies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/features/movies-19991230 |title=100 Years, 100 Maverick Movies |last=Travers

In 1993, the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] Group compiled a [[Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time]] list, with festival director Piers Handling writing a lack of Cronenberg films was significant, and that ''Dead Ringers'' and ''[[Videodrome]]'' divided voters, causing neither to win a place on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Handling |first=Piers |date=Fall 1994 |title=Canada's ten best |magazine=[[Take One (Canadian magazine)|Take One]] |volume= |issue= |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dead Ringers'' afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update,&lt;ref name="Gravestock"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tiff.net/canadas-all-time-top-ten |title=Essay |last=Gravestock |first=Steve |date=26 June 2015 |accessdate=28 August 2016 |work=[[Toronto International Film Festival]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704203521/http://tiff.net/canadas-all-time-top-ten |archivedate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seventh in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/atanarjuat-voted-no-1-canadian-film-of-all-time-1.3047162 |title=Atanarjuat voted No. 1 Canadian film of all time |last= |first= |date=24 April 2015 |accessdate=29 August 2016 |work=[[CBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
Irons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for ''Dead Ringers'', and when he won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] in 1991 for ''[[Reversal of Fortune]]'', he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/108754-part-2-the-dark-side/P1/ |title=100 Essential Male Film Performances - The Dark Side |work=[[PopMatters]] |date= 2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four million people in [[Australia]] (18.5%) reported having a [[disability]] in 2009, according to the results of the Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers.&lt;ref name=ABS2009&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics 2009, [http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/9C2B94626F0FAC62CA2577FA0011C431/$File/44300_2009.pdf Disability, Ageing and Carers, Australia: Summary of Findings], cat. no. 4430.0, ABS, Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|For the purposes of Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers, disability is defined as any limitation, restriction or impairment which restricts everyday activities and has lasted or is likely to last for at least six months. Examples range from loss of sight that is not corrected by glasses, to arthritis which causes difficulty dressing, to advanced dementia that requires constant help and supervision.}} Males and females were similarly affected by disability (18% and 19% respectively).&lt;ref name=ABS2009/&gt;

==Demographics==
[[File:Australian Census 2011 demographic map - Australia by SLA - BCP field 3654 Persons Total Has need for assistance.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|People in need of assistance in a core activity as a percentage of the total population, subdivided by statistical local area, at the 2011 census.]]
Just under one in five Australians (18.5%) reported disability in 2009. A further 21% had a long-term health condition that did not restrict their everyday activities. The remaining 60% of the Australian population had neither a disability nor a long term health condition. Of those with a reported disability, 87% had a specific limitation or restriction; that is, an impairment restricting their ability to perform communication, mobility or self-care activities, or a restriction associated with schooling or employment.&lt;ref name=ABS2009/&gt;

The disability rate increases steadily with age, with younger people less likely to report a disability than older people. Of those aged four years and under, 3.4% were affected by disability, compared with 40% of those aged between 65 and 69 and 88% of those aged 90 years and over.&lt;ref name=ABS2009/&gt;

Rates of disability and rates of profound or severe core-activity limitation for 5- to 14-year-old males (11% and 6.6% respectively) were close to double those for females in the same age group (6.1% and 3.0% respectively). In contrast, women aged 90 years and over had a higher rate of profound or severe core-activity limitations (75%) than men of the same age (58%).&lt;ref name=ABS2009/&gt;

In 2015, there were 2.1 million Australians of working age with disability. Of these, 1.0 million were employed and another 114,900 were looking for work rounding to 53.4% of working age people with disability were in the labour force which compares to 83.2% of people with no disability. In 2015, 25.0% of people with a profound or severe limitation were in the labour force, compared with 58.9% of those with a mild limitation. In 2012, the labour force participation rate was higher for people with profound or severe limitations at 29.7%. &lt;ref name="ABS2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=ABS|first1=Canberra|title=Disability, Ageing and Carers, Australia: Summary of Findings, 2015.4430.0|url=http://www.beta.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/4430.0Main%20Features202015?issue=2015&amp;num=&amp;opendocument=&amp;prodno=4430.0&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;view|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=7 December 2017}}  [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/au/ Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Australia (CC BY 2.5 AU)] license.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015, almost one in five Australians reported living with disability (18.3% or 4.3 million people). A further 22.1% of Australians had a long-term health condition but no disability, while the remaining 59.5% had neither disability nor a long-term health condition.&lt;ref name="ABS2015" /&gt;

In 2015, 18.6% of females and 18.0% of males had disability. Differences between males and females was most pronounced amongst people in older age groups with a 68.3% of females aged 90 years and over had a profound or severe limitation compared with 51.2% of males. At some ages there were higher proportions of males with disability such as for age groups 5 to 14 years (males 12.0% and females 7.0%) and 65 to 69 years (males 39.7% and females 36.0%).&lt;ref name="ABS2015" /&gt;

The SDAC data on older people (those aged 65 years and over) from Australia's ageing population shows that there were around 3.5 million older Australians in 2015, representing one in every seven people or 15.1% of the population in which this proportion has increased from 14.3% in 2012. Older Australians living in households were more active, with the proportion that participated in physical activities for exercise or recreation increasing from 44.5% in 2012 to 49.2% in 2015. The majority of older Australians were living in households (94.8%), while 5.2% or one in twenty lived in cared accommodation such as nursing homes.
While the proportion of older Australians has increased, the prevalence of disability amongst them has decreased. In 2015, 50.7% of older people were living with disability, down from 52.7% in 2012. Two-thirds of older Australians (67.3%) that reported their income lived in a household with an equivalised gross household income that was in the lowest two quintiles. This proportion has decreased from 74.6% in 2012.&lt;ref name="ABS2015" /&gt;

===Trends===
The prevalence of disability in Australia fell from 20% in 2003 to 18.5% in 2009. After removing the effects of different age structures the age standardised rate also fell by 2.1 percentage points. The decrease is particularly noticeable in the younger age groups. From 2003 to 2009, the disability rate for 15- to 24-year-olds fell from 9.0% to 6.6%. Over the same period the rate of disability also decreased for those aged between 25 and 34 from 11% to 8.6%. Similarly, 22% of 45- to 54-year-olds reported a disability in 2003, compared with 18% in 2009.&lt;ref name=ABS2009/&gt;

The rate of profound or severe limitation in the core activities of communication, mobility and self-care declined, from 6.3% in 2003 to 5.8% in 2009. Much of the decrease in the prevalence of disability between 2003 and 2009 is due to a decline in the proportion of Australians disabled by physical health conditions, such as asthma and heart disease.&lt;ref name=ABS2009/&gt;

The incidence of disability caused by physical conditions, as opposed to mental or behavioural disorders, dropped from 17% in 2003, to 15% in 2009. For instance, in 2003, 6.8% of Australians had a disability primarily caused by musculoskeletal disorders such as arthritis and back problems, with this proportion declining to 6.5% in 2009. Likewise, the incidence of disability caused by diseases of the circulatory system dropped from 1.8% to 1.4%. In 2003, 8.8% of people aged in the 65 years and older group reported a disability due to diseases of the circulatory system, compared with 7.4% in 2009.&lt;ref name=ABS2009/&gt;

The incidence of disability caused by asthma also declined, from 0.8% in 2003 to 0.5% in 2009. Amongst younger people (0 to 17 years), the incidence of disability caused by asthma almost halved between 2003 and 2009, from 0.9% in 2003 to 0.5% in 2009. Of those aged between 18 and 44 years, the incidence of asthma-related disability also decreased, from 0.5% in 2003 to 0.3%. In addition, for this age group, the proportion of people with a disability due to back problems reduced, from 2.6% in 2003 to 1.9% in 2009.&lt;ref name=ABS2009/&gt;

The incidence of disability due to back problems also declined amongst those aged between 45 and 64 years. In this age group, 5.2% of people reported a disability as a result of back problems in 2009, compared with 6.0% in 2003. By contrast, the prevalence of disability resultant from back problems amongst those aged 65 and over has increased since 2003, from 4.9% to 6.3%.&lt;ref name=ABS2009/&gt;

==Law==
In 1992, a High Court case was held, asking who should decide if a disabled girl was to have a sterilisation procedure.  Since that time, all decisions about this kind of procedure have been heard in the [[Family Court of Australia|Family Court]] or similar bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hallahan |first1=Lorna |title=Time to stop the forced sterilisation of girls and women with disability |url=https://theconversation.com/time-to-stop-the-forced-sterilisation-of-girls-and-women-with-disability-9812 |website=The Conversation |accessdate=29 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Disability Discrimination Act 1992]] (DDA) was an act passed by the [[Parliament of Australia]] in 1992 to promote the [[rights]] of people with disabilities in certain areas such as housing, education and provision of goods and services. It shares a common philosophy with other [[disability discrimination act]]s around the world that have emerged in the late 20th and early 21st century, as well as earlier [[civil rights]] legislation designed to prevent [[racial discrimination]] and [[sexism|sex discrimination]].

At the time of the enactment of the DDA, a variety of anti-discrimination acts for people with disabilities already existed in the different state legislatures, some dating back to the early 1980s. All States and Territories except [[Tasmania]] and the [[Northern Territory]] had anti-discrimination laws in place, and these two places had legislation under consideration. There were three reasons given for enacting a federal law:
*To standardise the scope of rights offered around the country
*To implement the Australian Government’s obligations as a signatory to international declarations on the rights of people with disabilities.
*To enable regulation of discriminatory practices of Commonwealth authorities.

Complaints made under the DDA are made to the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]] (previously known as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, HREOC), which also handles complaints relating to the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]], [[Sex Discrimination Act 1984]], [[Age Discrimination Act 2004]] and the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986]].

A [[Productivity Commission]] enquiry was initiated by the Australian government to evaluate the effectiveness of the act, and published its findings in 2004. The Commission found that while there is still room for improvement, particularly in reducing discrimination in employment, overall the DDA has been reasonably effective. Specifically, the Commission found that people with a disability were less likely to finish school, to have a TAFE or university qualification and to be employed. They are more likely to have a below average income, be on a pension, live in public housing and in prison. The average personal income for people with a disability is 44 per cent of the income of other Australians.

[[DisabilityCare Australia]], formerly known as the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), is a [[Health care in Australia|healthcare program]] initiated by the [[Australian government]]. The bill was introduced into parliament in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PM introduces NDIS bill to parliament|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/gillard-introduces-ndis-legislation/story-e6frf7kf-1226526333897|publisher=Herald Sun|accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013 the first stage of DisabilityCare Australia commenced in South Australia, Tasmania, the [[Hunter Region]] in New South Wales and the Barwon area of Victoria, while the Australian Capital Territory will commence in July 2014.

People with disabilities are over-represented in the [[Australian prison system]], as half of all people in the prison system have a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knaus|first1=Christopher|title=Centrelink rule change jeopardises disability pension for thousands of inmates|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/17/thousands-of-australian-prisoners-to-lose-disability-pension-upon-release|accessdate=17 May 2018|work=the Guardian|date=17 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carers==
In 2009, there were 2.6 million carers who provided assistance to those who needed help because of disability or old age. Just under one third of these (29%) were primary carers; that is, people who provided the majority of the informal help needed by a person with a disability or aged 60 years and over. Over two-thirds of primary carers (68%) were women. Thirteen percent of women were involved in a caring role, compared with 11% of men. The gender difference among carers was most pronounced for those aged 45 to 54 years, 16% of men and 23% of women in this age group provided care for a person with a disability or aged 60 years and over.&lt;ref name=ABS2009/&gt;

The proportion of Australians involved in caring for a person with a disability or an older person declined from 13% in 2003 to 12% in 2009, in line with the decrease in disability prevalence.&lt;ref name=ABS2009/&gt;

Australia is one of six nations that have implemented a carer system, in which their program follows under a more liberal democracy style that has family carers provide the majority of care to disabled and frail older people. However, most receive no formal services: 56% of primary carers supporting a disabled person under 65 and 65% of primary carers of older people had no such assistance in 2009. An official 2011 report concluded that carer support is ‘administered in an ad hoc way across a number of programs and jurisdictions’ and a report on the welfare of Australians found that 38% of primary carers felt that they needed more support in maintaining their own health, as well as physical, emotional and financial support. &lt;ref name="Partner-Carers13"&gt;{{copied  Cass, Bettina, et al. “The Emergence of Policy Supporting Working Carers: Developments in Six Countries.” Combining Paid Work and Family Care: Policies and Experiences in International Perspective, edited by Sue Yeandle and Teppo Kröger, Policy Press at the University of Bristol, Bristol, 2013, pp. 23–50. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qgp6n.8.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Australia introduced Carer Pension, Carer Payment (CP), to provide income support for carers unable to support themselves through substantial paid employment. It is means-tested on the income of both the care provider and the care receiver, who must also meet an assessment of disability. However, it is not subject to activity testing and not included in the ‘activation’ policies applied to most other forms of income support for working-age people. In 2006, CP recipients participated in paid work, unpaid work, education or training for up to 25 hours per week, however, only 23% had earnings while receiving it. Reasons for this outcome included the strain of caring responsibilities, inadequate skills and training, and the carer’s own health problem or disability: about 40% of recipients had not been in employment when they started caring and/or receiving CP.  Many carers rely on government income support as their main source of income, however, reflecting their lower rates of labour force participation and concentration in part-time work. In 2003, income support was the main source of personal cash income for 40% of Australian carers, compared with 24% of other people.&lt;ref name="Partner-Carers13" /&gt;

In a 2009 Survey of Disability, Ageing, and Carers (SDAC), Australia identified 529,000 working-age partner-carers – 27% of all carers of working age. Also identified 188,000 ‘primary’ partner-carers, who constituted the largest group of working-age primary carers (34%). Just over half (55%) of this group were women. Partner-carers in Australia tend to be older: 70% of working-age partner-carers were over 45, and over 40% were aged 55–64, although there were few gender differences in their age profiles (ABS, 2011).&lt;ref name="Partner-Carers2" /&gt;

Among working-age primary carers, nearly half the partner-carers spent less than 20 hours per week providing care, but around 20% cared for 20–40 hours per week and a third intensively (40+ hours per week). Across all age groups, women were more likely than men to provide intensive levels of care.&lt;ref name="Partner-Carers2" /&gt;

Female partner-carers had provided care over a longer period of time than males: among primary partner-carers, 58% of men and 63% of women had been caring for five years or more. Partner-carers in Australia, are most likely to provide high levels of support because they are likely to live with the person for whom they care. The SDAC data show that nearly half of all carers, and over 90% of primary carers, assisted a spouse with a profound or severe limitation. 73% of primary partner-carers supported a person with a head injury, stroke or other brain damage and 15% cared for a person with mental illness. Among those of working age, partner-carers were less likely to be employed full-time, or employed at all, than both other carers and non-carers, and those aged 55–64 were less likely to be employed than their younger counterparts. &lt;ref name="Partner-Carers2"&gt;{{copied  Valentine, Kylie. “Reconciling Work and Care for Parent-Carers of Disabled Children in Australia and England: Uncertain Progress.” Combining Paid Work and Family Care: Policies and Experiences in International Perspective, edited by Sue Yeandle and Teppo Kröger, Policy Press at the University of Bristol, Bristol, 2013, pp. 125–142. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qgp6n.13.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, an estimated 288,300 Australian children aged 0–14 had some kind of disability: over 3% of 0–4 year olds, and almost 9% of 5–14 year olds. Of these, 166,700 had a severe or profound ‘core activity limitation’, where they need assistance with regular communication, mobility or self-care tasks. Estimates suggest that about half of all disabled children aged 0–14 have two or more disabilities and almost 7% have four or five. A review of payments to primary parent-carers in Australia found intellectual and learning disabilities (4.3% of all children) and physical/diverse disabilities (4.2%) to be most prevalent, while analysis of the primary disability of service users found that this was ‘intellectual’ for about 30% of people, ‘physical’ for almost 17% and ‘autism’ for about 6%.&lt;ref name="Partner-Carers3" /&gt;

The demographics of carers for the youth differ from the old as Australia's introduction of deinstitutionalisation in the 1980s support parents to raise their children at home, including care for most disabled children. Frustrated parent-carers of disabled children have expressed their struggles in Australia that carers of other people do not have, but often live in disadvantaged circumstances such as their incomes are often lower than those of other families: in 2003, 50% of primary carers of disabled children were in the bottom two income quin-tiles, compared with 34% of non-carers . Primary carers of children with severe disabilities were much more likely (67%) than non-carers (24%) to have a government pension or allowance as their primary source of income.&lt;ref name="Partner-Carers3"&gt;{{copied  Fry, Gary, et al. “‘In Sickness and in Health’ and beyond: Reconciling Work and Care for a Partner in Australia and England.” Combining Paid Work and Family Care: Policies and Experiences in International Perspective, edited by Teppo Kröger and Sue Yeandle, Policy Press at the University of Bristol, Bristol, 2013, pp. 183–200. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qgp6n.16.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In response Australian Commonwealth and state/territory governments developed a few initiatives to support all carers including young people with disabilities and their parents. They have developed a few programs that focuses on access to services for disabled children and supported combining paid work and family care for parents to care for their children. In Queensland, the Building Bright Futures Action Plan &lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/Documents/TableOffice/TabledPapers/2010/5310T2330.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;(2010–13) for children with a disability was developed to prioritize access to early intervention services, build evidence-based support and strengthen the disability services workforce. Another in New South Wales, the Stronger Together Plan&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facs.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/236359/Stronger-Together.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (2006–16) is designed to enable children with a disability to grow up in a family and participate in the community, and to support adults with a disability to live in and be part of the community (with services such as respite, therapy, innovative care and family and sibling support). The Commonwealth even developed their own program called Helping Children with Autism package (HCWA) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.amaze.org.au/discover/how-we-can-help-you/hcwa/&lt;/ref&gt; (from 2009) which provides funding for early intervention services such as the access to advisors who provide information on eligibility, funding and services; supported playgroups; new items on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS).&lt;ref name="Partner-Carers3" /&gt;

Another initiative was introducing new policies that are more beneficial for carers specifically including the Carer Recognition Act &lt;ref&gt;https://www.dss.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/05_2016/carer_recognition_act_2010_guidelines_april_2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (2010) and the Carer Strategy&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dss.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/10_2012/ncs_action_plan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (2011) because mainstream programs often do not cater for reconciling work and care for parent-carers of disabled children for children with disabilities, which can severely curtail their parents’ opportunities for paid employment. The Fair Work Act &lt;ref&gt;https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017C00323&lt;/ref&gt; (2009) was passed for parent-carers to have flexible working arrangements until their disabled child is 18. In 2008, the Commonwealth government began to conduct a major review of Carer Payment for children, with a task-force that included representatives of families of disabled children, carers, non-governmental organisations, academics and clinicians. The review found that because their children did not meet the definition of ‘profoundly disabled’, many parents were ineligible for Carer Payment. It led to a broadening of the eligibility criteria, with 19,000 parent-carers subsequently expected to be newly eligible for the payment. &lt;ref name="Partner-Carers3" /&gt;

==Work==
In Australia in 2009, over one million working-age people with disability (50%) were in paid employment, comprising 10% of the total Australian workforce. Men with disability (55%) were more likely to be employed than women with disability (45%). Although there have been improvements in anti-discrimination legislation, people with disability are still less likely to be working than other Australians. The labour force participation rate for those aged 15–64 years with disability in 2009 was 54%, much lower than that for those without disability (83%). One of the priority outcomes of the National Disability Strategy 2010–2020 is to "increase access to employment opportunities as a key to improving economic security and personal wellbeing for people with disability..."&lt;ref name=ABS2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Disability and Work|url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/3969FB4AA4FAE54DCA2579CE000BB9C7/$File/41020_Disability_Mar2012.pdf|work=Catalogue 4102.0 Australian Social Trends March 2012|author=Australian Bureau of Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2012, half of working-age Australians with a disability were employed, whereas for non-disabled working-age Australians, this was 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Young |first1=Stella |authorlink1=Stella Young |title=Mr Hockey, we cannot afford not to have a NDIS |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-05-21/young-ndis-a-no-brainer/4022652 |work=ABC News |date=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disability rate for Australians aged 15–64 years, those of ‘prime working age’, rose from 15% in 1993 to a peak of 17% in 2003, then returned to 15% in 2009.&lt;ref name=ABS2012/&gt;

Over the sixteen years from 1993 to 2009, the unemployment rate for 15- to 64-year-olds with disability decreased from 17.8% to 7.8%, in line with the similar decline in unemployment for those with no disability (from 12.0% in 1993 to 5.1% in 2009). However, the unemployment rate for people with disability continued to be significantly higher than for those without disability in 2009.&lt;ref name=ABS2012/&gt;

Of those people with disability who were not in the labour force, one fifth (20% or 194,000) had no employment restriction, meaning that it was not their disability which prevented them from working. Difficulties such as access to childcare (22%), were reported as limiting these people's ability to participate in the labour force despite having no employment restrictions. For people
without disability who were not in the labour force, other difficulties were reported such as a lack of vacancies or suitable hours (both 11%).&lt;ref name=ABS2012/&gt;

The type of disability that an individual has can affect their likelihood of participating in the labour market. People with sensory or speech impairment had the best labour market outcomes with a participation rate of 54% and an unemployment rate of 7.0%, while people whose disability was psychological had the lowest participation rate (29%), and the highest unemployment rate (19%). People with sensory or speech impairment may be able to benefit from assistive technologies but this is not the case for people with psychological disability such as mental illness. People with mental illness may experience disruption to their work attendance and career due to the episodic nature of their disability.&lt;ref name=ABS2012/&gt;

As with disability type, the severity of a person’s disability is reflected in their ability to participate in the labour force. Generally, labour force participation decreases as the severity of disability increases. In 2009, those aged 15–64 years with moderate or mild disability had a participation rate of 53%, while those with profound or severe disability had a labour force participation rate of 31%. This pattern was evident across all types of disability. For example, the participation rate of those with moderate or mild physical restriction was 51%, while those with profound or severe physical restriction had a participation rate of 28%. To see a pattern in unemployment rates, severity and type of disability need to be looked at together. For example, the unemployment rate for people with intellectual disability was high in comparison with other disability groups, regardless of severity. Those with moderate or mild intellectual disability (20%) had a higher unemployment rate than those
with moderate or mild physical disability (8.8%). This may partly reflect the unique barriers that people with intellectual disability face in accessing education and work.&lt;ref name=ABS2012/&gt;

Some people with disability experience employment restrictions such as being restricted in the type of job they can do or the number of hours they can work, or needing special assistance in the workplace. People with disability who had an employment restriction were far less likely to be participating in the labour force (46%) than those without an employment restriction (71%). Of the 69% of people with disability who had an employment restriction, two of the most common restrictions were the type of job or the number of hours they could work (51% and 31% respectively). People with profound or severe disability were the most likely to have some kind of employment restriction (92%).&lt;ref name=ABS2012/&gt;

Generally, people with disability who were employed were more likely than people without disability to work part-time (38% and 31% respectively). The number of hours usually worked by people with disability was associated with the severity and type of disability they had. People with profound or severe disability who worked were more likely to work part-time hours than those with less severe disability. Nevertheless, almost half (49%) of those with profound or severe disability who were working, worked full-time. Among the five disability groups, psychological and intellectual disabilities have greater association with fewer working hours. More than a third (35%) of people with psychological disability who worked, usually worked no more than 15 hours, followed by people with intellectual disability (30%). In contrast, about two thirds of employed people with sensory or speech disability (66%) or physical disability (61%) worked full-time.&lt;ref name=ABS2012/&gt;

Almost one fifth (19%) of working-age people with disability who were employed in 2009 worked as professionals, followed by clerical and administrative workers,
and technicians and trade workers (both 15%). The distribution of people across different occupations is similar for people with and without disability. However, there was some variation of occupations according to the type of disability. For example, around one third (34%) of employed people with intellectual disability were working as labourers, such as cleaners, in 2009, while one-fifth (20%) of employed people with sensory or speech disability were in professional occupations, such as secondary
school teachers. Both people with and without disability had similar distributions across industry groups. Some industries had a higher than average (10%) disability prevalence rate, particularly Agriculture, forestry and fishing (15%) and Transport, postal and warehousing (12%). This may be partly reflective of the older age profile of people in these industries. People with disability who were working were more likely to run their own business (13%), and/or work from home (9%), than employed people without disability (10% and 6% respectively). Such situations may enhance the flexibility of working arrangements, making it easier for people with disability
to participate in the labour force.&lt;ref name=ABS2012/&gt;

Among working-age people with disability who were employed, the most commonly reported main source of cash income was wages or salary (77%), much higher than the next most common income sources, government pensions or allowances, and business income (both 9%). Of people with disability who were employed, over one fifth (22%) received some form of government pension or allowance. This was nearly double that of people without disability who were employed and in receipt of a government pension or allowance (12%). People with disability who were working part-time were more likely to receive a government pension or allowance (41%) than those working full-time (10%). The main disability income support, The Disability Support Pension, can provide income to supplement earnings from work.&lt;ref name=ABS2012/&gt;

Employers and disability employment service providers may need to make special arrangements to ensure that employees with disability have a suitable environment
in which to work. In 2009, 12% of employed people with disability required some type of special work arrangement such as being provided with special equipment or being allocated different duties. The type of disability influenced whether assistance was needed in the workplace and the kind of assistance required. Employed
people with psychological or intellectual disability were likely to require special working arrangements, with nearly one fifth (18% and 16% respectively) receiving assistance, such as a support person to assist or train them on the job. People with sensory or speech disability who were working were less likely to require special working arrangements, with one tenth (9%) receiving special working arrangements. For this disability group, assistance provided took the form of special equipment (48%).&lt;ref name=ABS2012/&gt;

The TV show [[Employable Me]], broadcast in March and April 2018, followed [[neurodiverse]] adults in finding suitable employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buckmaster|first1=Luke|title=Employable Me: the ABC's brutally honest portrait of job hunting with a disability|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/03/employable-me-the-abcs-brutally-honest-portrait-of-job-hunting-with-a-disability|accessdate=12 April 2018|work=the Guardian|date=3 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Income===
Disability can affect a person’s capacity to participate in the labour force and their ability to earn income. The following 2015 SDAC results relate to people of working age (15 to 64 years) who were living in households. In 2015, around two in five (41.9%) people of working age with disability reported that their main source of cash income was a government pension or allowance, followed by wages or salary (36.5%). Those with a profound limitation were more than twice as likely to report a government pension or allowance as their main source of income (82.8%) than those with a mild limitation (37.2%).&lt;ref name="ABS2015" /&gt;

People with disability were more likely to have lower levels of income than those without disability. In 2015, approximately half (49.4%) of people with disability lived in households in the lowest two quintiles for equivalised gross household income, compared with 24.3% of those without disability (excluding those for whom their income was not known). People with disability were also less likely to live in households with incomes in the highest quintile (13.4%) compared to those without disability (26.5%).&lt;ref name="ABS2015" /&gt;

Given the smaller proportion of people earning a wage or salary and their greater reliance on government pensions and allowances, it follows that income levels for those with disability would be lower than those without disability. In 2015, the median gross income for a person with disability aged 15 to 64 years was $465 per week, less than half the $950 per week income of a person without disability.&lt;ref name="ABS2015" /&gt;

==Sport==
{{Main|Disabled sport in Australia}}
Australian participation in disability sports is lower than in able bodied sports.&lt;ref name="theconv2012"&gt;[http://theconversation.edu.au/beyond-the-paralympics-where-to-for-disability-sport-in-australia-9439 Beyond the Paralympics: where to for disability sport in Australia?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Public funding for disability sport focuses on the Paralympics and the [[Australian Paralympic Committee]] who have a 'Talent Search' program to provide support for potential candidates seeking to enter elite disability sports.&lt;ref name="theconv2012"/&gt;  [[Australia at the Paralympics|Australia's participation at the Paralympics]] has included sending delegations to the Summer Paralympics since the first games in 1960, and to the Winter Paralympics since 1980.

==Advocacy==
[[People with Disability Australia]] is the national peak disability rights and advocacy organisation.

==Disability service providers==
As of 2012 and 2013, 31% of service providers were in the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Pavla|last2=Hayward|first2=David|title=Social policy ‘generosity’ at a time of fiscal austerity: The strange case of Australia’s National Disability Insurance Scheme|journal=[[Critical Social Policy]]|date=22 August 2016|volume=37|issue=1|pages=128–147|doi=10.1177/0261018316664463}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2016, there were 2,000 disability service providers in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.everyaustraliancounts.com.au/wp-content/uploads/State_of_the_Disability_Sector_report_2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assistive technology==
Consumers of [[assistive technology]] have argued that they are subject to an [[Australia Tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=High cost of living with a disability|url=https://www.choice.com.au/shopping/online-shopping/buying-online/articles/cost-of-mobility-aids-and-assistive-technology|work=CHOICE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
A 2018 report found that over the last 15 years, within Australia, a person with disability had been murdered by their intimate carer (a friend or family member) every three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=When carers kill, there's a big difference between asking why and excusing a killer |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-23/when-carers-kill/9894514 |accessdate=23 June 2018 |work=ABC News |date=23 June 2018 |language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Disability can be the subject of theatrical performance.  For example ''[[Unspoken (play)|Unspoken]]'' presents a story about what it is like to have a brother with severe disabilities.

'''Independent living''', as seen by its [[advocate]]s, is a [[philosophy]], a way of looking at [[society]] and [[disability]], and a worldwide movement of people with disabilities working for [[Equal opportunity|equal opportunities]], [[self-determination]], and [[self-respect]]. In the context of [[eldercare]], independent living is seen as a step in the continuum of care, with [[assisted living]] being the next step.

In most countries, proponents of the IL Movement claim preconceived notions and a predominantly [[Medical model of disability|medical view of disability]] contribute to negative attitudes towards people with disabilities, portraying them as sick, defective and deviant persons, as objects of professional intervention, or as a burden for themselves and their families. These images have consequences for disabled people's opportunities for raising families of their own, getting [[education]] and [[employment|work]], which may result in persons with disabilities living in poverty. With the rise in Senior population, Independent Living facilities have risen in popularity as an option for aging citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Barriers to Independent Living for Individuals with Disabilities and Seniors|first1=Florence D.|last1=DiGennaro Reed|first2=Michael C.|last2=Strouse|first3=Sarah R.|last3=Jenkins|first4=Jamie|last4=Price|first5=Amy J.|last5=Henley|first6=Jason M.|last6=Hirst|date=11 June 2014|publisher=|journal=Behavior Analysis in Practice|volume=7|issue=2|pages=70–77|doi=10.1007/s40617-014-0011-6|pmid=27294013|pmc=4711747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Independent Living Movement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jar/2016/8062079/|title=Active and Healthy Ageing and Independent Living 2016|first1=Maddalena|last1=Illario|first2=Miriam M. R.|last2=Vollenbroek-Hutten|first3=D. William|last3=Molloy|first4=Enrica|last4=Menditto|first5=Guido|last5=Iaccarino|first6=Patrik|last6=Eklund|date=14 June 2018|publisher=|journal=Journal of Aging Research|volume=2016|pages=1–3|doi=10.1155/2016/8062079}}&lt;/ref&gt; grew out of the [[disability rights movement]], which began in the 1960s.  The IL Movement works at replacing the [[special education]] and rehabilitation experts' concepts of integration, [[normalisation (people with disabilities)|normalization]] and [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]] with a new [[paradigm]] developed by people with disabilities themselves. The first Independent Living ideologists and organizers were people with extensive disabilities (e.g., [[Ed Roberts (activist)|Ed Roberts]], [[Judith Heumann]], [[Peg Nosek]], [[Lex Frieden]]) and of course, early friends and collaborators in the 1970s (Julie Ann Racino) and university and government supporters throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Ed Roberts was a quadriplegic &lt;ref&gt;Richard Scotch, www.jstor.org/stable/3350150.&lt;/ref&gt; who dealt with discrimination in many different aspects of his life. His fight for acceptance in schools, however, is what Roberts is most well known for. In high school, Roberts was stopped from graduating because he could not complete his gym requirement, as he was paralyzed and spent most of his time in an [[iron lung]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Kim Nielsen, A Disability History of the United States&lt;/ref&gt; His biggest educational challenge came when he was accepted at college. After struggling to get accepted, the UCBerkeley refused to give Roberts financial aid. He then sued Berkeley for access and integration. Although he won the case, Roberts was housed in school's infirmary instead of the dorms. As others with disabilities started attending the school and living in the infirmary, an activist group called the Rolling Quads was formed. They ended up starting the Disabled Students' Program, a resource for those with disabilities that was run by people with disabilities.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This program led to the first independent living center in America being made, the Berkeley Center for Independent Living.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Scotch, www.jstor.org/stable/3350150&lt;/ref&gt; These centers flourished across the United States and are a huge part of why Ed Roberts was so instrumental in the start of the Independent Living Movement. Still, the movement's message seems most popular among people whose lives depend on assistance with the activities of daily living and who, in the view of the IL Movement, are most exposed to custodial care, [[paternalistic]] attitudes and control by professionals. In 2015, independent living centers are codified in law throughout the US, and offer a variety of "professional services" (i.e., independent living) under government payment structures in the US.

==Philosophy==
The Independent Living philosophy postulates that people with disabilities are the best experts on their needs, and therefore they must take the initiative, individually and collectively, in designing and promoting better solutions and must organize themselves for political power. Besides de-professionalization and self-representation, the Independent Living ideology comprises de-medicalization of disability, de-institutionalization and cross-disability (i.e. inclusion in the IL Movement regardless of diagnoses).

In the Independent Living philosophy, people with disabilities are primarily seen as citizens and only secondarily as consumers of healthcare, rehabilitation or social services. As citizens in democratic societies, the IL Movement claims, persons with disabilities have the same right to participation, to the same range of options, degree of freedom, control and self-determination in everyday life and life projects that other citizens take for granted. Thus, IL activists demand the removal of infrastructural, institutional and attitudinal barriers and the adoption of the [[Universal Design]] principle. Depending on the individual's disability, support services such as [[assistive technology]], income supplements or personal assistance are seen as necessary to achieve equal opportunities. As emphasized by the IL Movement, needs assessment and service delivery must enable users to control their services, to freely choose among competing service providers and to live with dignity in the community. Cash benefits or [[Direct Payments]] are favored by IL activists over services in kind in terms of the outcomes for users' quality of life and cost-efficiency.

Over the years, the IL Movement has spread from [[Americans with disabilities|North America]] to all continents, adapting itself to and getting enriched by different cultures and economic conditions in the process.  A considerable body of research, training materials and examples of good practice exists on such themes as transition from institutional to community living, transition from school to employment or self-employment, community organizing and advocacy, disability culture, girls and women with disabilities as well as disability and development. Supporting the movement and utilizing its work has become an important ingredient of many countries' social policy.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Independent Living does not mean that we want to do everything by ourselves, do not need anybody or like to live in isolation. Independent Living means that we demand the same choices and control in our every-day lives that our non-disabled brothers and sisters, neighbors and friends take for granted. We want to grow up in our families, go to the neighborhood school, use the same bus as our neighbors, work in jobs that are in line with our education and interests, and raise families of our own. We are profoundly ordinary people sharing the same need to feel included, recognized and loved."&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Adolf Ratzka, http://www.independentliving.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== In Germany ==
In the 1970s/1980s, in [[Germany]], the autonomous [[disability rights movement]], also called the cripples movement, claimed for themselves the word ''cripple'' in the sense of a [[reappropriation]].&lt;br /&gt;The ''cripple tribunal'' in [[Dortmund]] on 13 December 1981 was one of the main protest actions of the autonomous German disability movement (in confrontation with the established disability assistance) against human rights abuses in [[Nursing homes]] and [[Psychiatric hospitals]], and as well against deficiencies of the local public-transport.   
Analogous to the [[Russell Tribunal]] by [[Amnesty International]], the ''cripple tribunal'' has denounced human rights violations of disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disabilityworld.org/01-03_02/news/tribunal.shtml cripple tribunal on disabilityworld.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123083149/http://disabilityworld.org/01-03_02/news/tribunal.shtml |date=2010-11-23 }} Retrieved 2012-01-21&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Europe ==
In 1989 over 80 disabled persons and supporters coming from the Independent Living movement gathered in Strasbourg, France for a conference on personal assistance. The conference was funded by the German Green party and was an opportunity for members of the Independent Living movement to meet. This meeting resulted in the founding of ENIL – The [[European Network on Independent Living]]. This network includes members from the [[European Union]] and its neighbors. ENIL promotes Independent Living at the European level but also at national and regional levels.

==Centers for Independent Living==
In 1972, the first '''Center for Independent Living''' was founded by disability activists, led by [[Ed Roberts (activist)|Ed Roberts]], in [[Berkeley, California]].  These Centers were created to offer [[peer support]] and [[role model]]ing, and are run and controlled by persons with disabilities. According to the IL approach, the example of a peer, somebody who has been in a similar situation, can be more powerful than a non-disabled professional's interventions in analyzing one's situation, in assuming responsibility for one's life and in developing coping strategies.

According to the IL Movement, with peer support, everyone – including persons with extensive [[developmental disabilities]] – can learn to take more initiative and control over their lives. For example, peer support is used in Independent Living Skills classes where people living with their families or in institutions learn how to run their everyday lives in preparation for living by themselves.

There is a fundamental set of services (Core Services) found in all of the Centers, but there is some variation in the programs that are offered, the funding sources, and the staffing, among other things. Depending on the public services in the community, Centers might assist with housing referral and adaptation, personal assistance referral, or [[legal aid]]. Typically, Centers work with local and regional governments to improve infrastructure, raise awareness about disability issues and lobby for [[:Category:Disability legislation|legislation that promotes equal opportunities]] and prohibits [[discrimination]]. Effective centers have proven to be in states like California, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois.&lt;ref name="Zames1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fleischer | first = Doris | title = The Disability Rights Movement | publisher = Temple University Press | location = Philadelphia | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-56639-812-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Infant sleep training''' refers to a number of different regimens parents employ to adjust their child's sleep behaviors.

==The development of sleep over the first year==

During the first year of life, infants spend most of their time in the sleeping state. Assessment of sleep during infancy presents an opportunity to study the impact of sleep on the maturation of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), overall functioning, and future cognitive, psychomotor, and temperament development. Sleep is essential to human life and involves both physiologic and behavioral processes. Sleep is now understood as not simply a resting state, but a state that involves intense brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;Carskadon MA, Dement WC. Normal human sleep: an overview. In: Kryger MH, Roth T, Dement WC, editors. Principles and practice of sleep medicine. 4th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier Saunders; 2005. pp. 13–23.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first year of life is a time of substantial change in the development of both the human brain and sleep. The relationship between the two is vital, as the control of sleep and the sleep-wake cycle are regulated by the CNS.&lt;ref name='Sheldon 1996'&gt;Sheldon SH. In: Evaluating sleep in infants and children. Philadelphia: Lippincott-Raven; 1996. Development of CNS function; pp.&amp;nbsp;71–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''long sustained sleep period (LSP)'' is the period of time that a child sleeps without awaking.  The length of this period increases dramatically between the first and second months. Between the ages of three and twenty-one months, LSP plateaus, increasing on average only about 30 minutes.&lt;ref name = "henderson"&gt;Henderson, J.M.T., France, K.G. &amp; Blampied, N.M. (2010). The consolidation of infants' nocturnal sleep across the first year of life. Sleep Medicine Reviews, 15 (4), 211-220.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a child’s ''longest self-regulated sleep period (LSRSP)'' is the period of time where a child, without sleep problems, is able to self-initiate sleep without parental intervention upon waking.&lt;ref name = "henderson"/&gt; This self-regulation, also called ‘’’self-soothing’’’, allows the child to consistently use these skills during the nocturnal period. LSRSP dramatically increases in length over the first 4 months, plateaus, and then steadily increases at 9 months. By about 6 months, most infants can sleep 8 hours or more at night uninterrupted or without parental intervention upon awaking.&lt;ref name = "henderson"/&gt;

In terms of actual numbers, an infant from one to three months of age may sleep sixteen to eighteen hours a day in periods that last from three to four hours. By three months the period of sleep lengthens to about four or five hours, with a decrease in the total sleep time to about fourteen or fifteen hours. At three months, they also start to sleep when it is dark and wake when it is light. By 4 months there are 2 distinct napping periods, mid-morning and late afternoon. By 6 months the longest LSP is 6 hours and occurs during the night. There are two 3-or-more hour naps with a total average sleep time of fourteen hours.&lt;ref name = "Yale" &gt;Mayes, L.C. &amp; Cohen, D.J. (2002). The Yale Child Study Center Guide to Understand Your Child. United States: Little, Brown and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though sleep is a primarily biological process, it can be treated as a behavior. This means that it can be altered and managed through practice and can be learned by the child. Healthy sleep habits can be established during the first four months to lay a foundation for healthy sleep. These habits typically include sleeping in a crib (instead of a car seat, stroller, or swing), being put down to sleep drowsy but awake, and avoiding negative sleep associations, such as nursing to sleep or using a pacifier to fall asleep, which may be hard to break in the future.&lt;ref name="Yale"/&gt;

Every child is different and each child’s sleep becomes regular at different ages within a particular range. In the first few months of life, each time the baby is laid down for bed and each time he or she awakens is an opportunity for the infant to learn sleep self-initiation and to fall asleep without excessive external help from their caregiver.
Experts say that the ideal bedtime for an infant falls between 6 pm and 8 pm, with the ideal wake-up time falling between 6 am and 7 am. At four months of age, infants typically take hour naps two to three times a day, with the third nap dropped by about 9 months. By 1 year of age, the amount of sleep that most infants get nightly approximates to that of adults.&lt;ref name="Yale"/&gt;

== Good sleep conditions ==
Many parents try to understand, once the baby is asleep, how to keep them sleeping through the night. It is thought that it is important to have structure in the way a child is put to sleep so that he or she can establish good sleeping patterns.&lt;ref name="Yale"/&gt; Dr Sylvia Bell of Johns Hopkins University reported:&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/1127506?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents&lt;/ref&gt; by the end of the first year individual differences in crying reflect the history of maternal responsiveness rather than constitutional differences in infant irritability. She also notes: consistency and promptness of maternal response is associated with decline in frequency and duration of infant crying. The sleep position is also important to prevent SIDS ([[Sudden infant death syndrome|Sudden Infant Death Syndrome]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medlineplus.gov/suddeninfantdeathsyndrome.html|title=Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: MedlinePlus|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies in sleep training==

A key debate in sleep training revolves around getting the right balance between parental soothing and teaching the baby to self-soothe. Parents who practice attachment parenting think the parent should attend to the baby whenever he or she cries, and limit tears as much as possible.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} However, many popular sleep training methods, such as the [[Ferber Method]] rely on letting the baby "cry it out" for a certain number of minutes, so that so-called "self-soothing" skills are fostered instead of an over-reliance upon externally-provided soothing. The Ferber method has been criticized by some for being harsh, but sleep scientists have yet to find evidence of it causing lasting harm to a child. &lt;ref&gt;Storrs, Carina [http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/24/health/cry-it-out-sleep-training-ok/ "It's OK to let your baby cry himself to sleep, study finds"], ''[[CNN]]''.  Retrieved on 2 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some psychologists say the sleep scientists are failing to take into account the subtle psychological effects of being left alone to cry yourself out: they say: "The fact is that caregivers who habitually respond to the needs of the baby before the baby gets distressed, preventing crying, are more likely to have children who are independent than the opposite. Soothing care is best from the outset. Once patterns of distress get established, it's much harder to change them."&lt;ref&gt;Narvaez, Darcia Ph.D.  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201112/dangers-crying-it-out "Dangers of “Crying It Out"], ''[[Psychology Today]]''.  Retrieved on 2 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

Baby soothing techniques include bouncing, jiggling, rocking baby while sitting in a rocking chair, doing knee bends while holding them, doing comfort feeding, providing them with a pacifier, using a white noise machine or app, swaddling them, skin-to-skin contact, using a bouncer or swing to mechanically rock them, and more. Some parents reject the use of most or all baby soothing techniques under the idea that you should teach a baby to self-soothe. Other parents think having devices such as white noise machines and swings are crucial because they allow the parents' to take breaks and get things done other than just holding their baby.

Another method is [[Sleep disorder|Behavioral Infant Sleep Intervention]] to effectively reduce infant sleep problems and associated maternal depression in the short- to medium-terms. This method randomized tried and found effective though, despite their effectiveness, theoretical concerns persist about long-term harm on children’s emotional development, stress regulation, mental health, and the child-parent relationship &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=Anna M. H.|last2=Wake|first2=Melissa|last3=Ukoumunne|first3=Obioha C.|last4=Hiscock|first4=Harriet|date=2012-10-01|title=Five-Year Follow-up of Harms and Benefits of Behavioral Infant Sleep Intervention: Randomized Trial|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/4/643|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=130|issue=4|pages=643–651|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-3467|issn=0031-4005|pmid=22966034}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This method proves to be causing no long-lasting harms or benefits to child, child-parent, or maternal outcomes. Parents and health professionals can feel comfortable about using these techniques to reduce the population burden of infant sleep problems and maternal depression.

== Other influences on infant sleep ==

A number of factors have been shown to be associated with problems in sleep consolidation, including a child’s temperament, the degree to which s/he is breast-fed vs. bottle-fed, and his/her activities and sleepiness during the day.  Moreover, co-sleeping, which is defined here as sharing a room or bed with parents or siblings in response to an awakening, can be detrimental to sleep consolidation. It is important to note that none of these factors have been directly shown to cause children’s sleep consolidation issues. 
In terms of infant feeding, breastfeeding has been found to be associated with more waking at night than bottle-fed infants because of the infant’s ability to digest breast milk more quickly than formula.  Thus, breast-fed infants have been observed to begin sleeping through the night at a later age than bottle-fed infants: bottle fed infants tend to begin sleeping through the night between 6–8 weeks, while breastfed infants may take until 17 weeks before sleeping through the night.  Seventeen weeks of age is still within the first 4–5 months of the infants’ life; therefore, this cannot really be considered a delay in sleep consolidation.  There are many benefits to breastfeeding infants. 
Lastly, temperament also seems to yield correlations with sleep patterns. Researchers believe that infants classified as “difficult,” as well as those who are very sensitive to changes in the environment, tend to have a harder time sleeping through the night. Parents whose infants sleep through the night generally rate their infant’s temperaments more favorably than parents whose infant continue to wake; however, it is hard to determine if a given temperament causes sleep problems or if sleep problems promote specific temperaments or behaviors.&lt;ref name = "Pinilla"&gt;Pinilla, T. &amp; Birch, L. (1993). Help me make it through the night: Behavioral entertainment of breast-fed infants’ sleep patterns. Pediatrics 91 (2), 436-444.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jachcha Ki Baori''' is the largest [[stepwell]], near [[Prahalad Kund]] at [[Hindaun]] in the [[India]]n state of [[Rajasthan]]. It is near the Prahalad Kund on Karsauli and Kharata Road.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dainiknavajyoti.net/karoli/dovelopment-of-bawdi-from-campaign.html|title=अभियान से निखरा बावड़ी का प्राचीन स्वरूप|website=www.dainiknavajyoti.net|language=en|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The stepwell is said to have been built by Lakkhi Banjara. An interesting phenomenon associated with this is that when the water did not get excavated, a saint had said that if a Jachcha (pregnant woman) gives birth to a child, then it can get water in it. People say when once its water dried up and cleaned it, inside it the stone statue of a lady lying on a stone crate between the middle of the Stepwell, was seen in the statue of the lady. On the name of this it got the name Jachcha Ki Baori.

According to a folk tradition, the water of this Baudi does not require soap to make clothes clean.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:Jachchakibaori1.jpg|thumb]]
[[File:Jachchakibaoriside.jpg|thumb]]
There is no dilemma that the construction of Baudi is done in an artistic manner. Stairs that have been made to reach water in 200 feet wide and 200 feet long square Stepwell are made in sight. There are four pillars in the four corners of the Stepwell, Did not know what the reasons were made. There is a bedsteady statue of Jachcha in the middle. There is a quote on the left side of the Stepwell which by which the land was irrigated. On the edge of this is an ancient house which has now become a crescent.

The stepwell has in 2017 been repaired by the Rajasthan state government as part of its drive for water conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=68th State level Van Mahotsav After Water, State headed for Forest Revolution - Chief Minister|url=http://dipr.rajasthan.gov.in/content/dipr/en/news-detail.51203.html|publisher=Rajasthan State Government|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr '''James Duncan''' [[FRSE]] FRCS FRCSE (1810-1866) was a [[British people|British]] surgeon and manufacturing chemist responsible for much of the British supply of chloroform in the mid 19th century. From 1839 to 1866 he was Director of '''Duncan Flockhart &amp; Co''' one of Scotland’s largest chemical manufacturers.

==Life==
He was born in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] on 2 November 1810, the son of John Duncan (b.1780) founder of Duncan Flockhart &amp; Co. He was sent to the High School in [[Edinburgh]] to be educated.
In 1833 his father’s company moved from Perth to Edinburgh, with premises at 52 [[North Bridge, Edinburgh|North Bridge]] with the family living at 1 Blenheim Place at the top of [[Leith Walk]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1833-34&lt;/ref&gt; 

Meanwhile James was completing his study of Medicine at [[Edinburgh University]] graduating MD in 1834. He was taught Surgery by [[Robert Liston]].&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/b21465812/b21465812_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his rich father his postgraduate studies leading to his MD included studies in [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Italy]].

Around 1839 his father died and James became the new owner and director of [[MacFarlan Smith|Duncan Flockhart &amp; Co]]. The company had a shop on North Bridge in the city centre plus and office and manufacturing plant at 1 [[Constitution Street]] in [[Leith]] under the name of Duncan Flockhart &amp; Powell. William Flockhart,
the other partner, lived at 4 Gayfield Place at the top of [[Leith Walk]]. The third partner of the Leith firm, Frederick W. Powell lived at 29 Bernard Street in Leith, close to the factory.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1840-41&lt;/ref&gt;

He purchased a house a 7 Dundas Street in the [[New Town, Edinburgh|Second New Town]]. James was by then already acting as Senior Surgeon to the [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]] and also had his own consultancy within the New Town Dispensary. In 1839 the firm began to manufacture [[lactucarium]], and from 1847 became the main British manufacturer of [[Chloroform]], supplying to surgeons such as [[James Young Simpson|Sir James Simpson]] and to dentists such as [[Francis Brodie Imlach]] . The firm expanded, building new premises in [[London]] and supplied chloroform to both the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Richmond, Julie Stevenson, Alison Turton (25 Jun 2003). The Pharmaceutical Industry: A Guide to Historical Records. # Ashgate Publishing Limited. {{ISBN|0754633527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] his proposer being [[James David Forbes]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By his final years James was living at 12 Heriot Row, one of the largest and most prestigious houses in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1865-1866&lt;/ref&gt;

He died of oriental [[cholera]]&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/b21465812/b21465812_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Tours]] in [[France]] on 16 August 1866 whilst on a vacation.

His body was returned to [[Edinburgh]] for burial in [[Dean Cemetery]]. The magnificent but simple tomb lies on the western wall in the section known as "Lords Row". His wife and children lie with him.

==Family==

He was married to Margaret (1819-1895).

He was father to [[John Duncan (surgeon)|Dr John Duncan]] [[FRSE]] (1839-1899) President of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] 1889-1891 and  author of ''[[Angioma]] and Other Papers'' who inherited his Heriot Row property on his death.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1867-68&lt;/ref&gt;

His son Andrew Balfour Duncan joined the army and died in [[Taranaki]] in [[New Zealand]] in June 1864 aged only 23.

He was the maternal grandfather (through his daughter Jessie Duncan) of [[William James Stuart]], President of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] 1937 to 1939.&lt;ref&gt;https://library.rcsed.ac.uk/media/1251/gd8-papers-of-william-j-stuart.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lex Maria''' is the colloquial name for the [[mandatory reporting]] in Chapter 3 Paragraph 5 of the Swedish [[Patient Safety Law (Sweden)|Patient Safety Law (Patientsäkerhetslagen)]]. The  law requires that a care taker report to the [[Health and Social Care Inspectorate]] events that could have caused or have caused serious injury to the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/lexmaria|title=Lex Maria|website=www.socialstyrelsen.se|publisher=[[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)]]|language=Swedish|access-date=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name originates from an incident in 1936 when four patients at Maria hospital in [[Stockholm]] died after being injected with [[Disinfectant|desinfectant]] instead of [[anesthetic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ltarkiv.lakartidningen.se/2005/temp/pda29711.pdf|title=Fyra dödande injektioner ledde fram till Lex Maria|last=Wennergren|first=Göran|date=2005|newspaper=[[Läkartidningen]]|language=Swedish|trans-title=Four fatal injections led to Lex Maria|access-date=5 June 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Live blood analysis''' ('''LBA'''), '''live cell analysis''', '''Hemaview''' or '''nutritional blood analysis''' is the use of high-resolution [[dark field microscopy]] to observe live blood cells. Live blood analysis is promoted by some [[alternative medicine]] practitioners, who assert that it can diagnose a range of diseases. There is no scientific evidence that live blood analysis is reliable or effective, and it has been described as a fraudulent means of convincing patients that they are ill and should purchase [[dietary supplement]]s.&lt;ref name="ernst"/&gt;&lt;ref name="freyer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="weil"/&gt;

Live blood analysis is not accepted in laboratory practice and its validity as a laboratory test has not been established.&lt;ref name="CLIA"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-05-00-00250.pdf | format = PDF | title = CLIA regulation of unestablished laboratory tests | publisher = [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] | date = July 2001 | accessdate = January 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no scientific evidence for the validity of live blood analysis,&lt;ref name="CLIA"/&gt; it has been described as a pseudoscientific, bogus and fraudulent medical test,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brigden ML |title=Unproven (questionable) cancer therapies |journal=West.

It has its origins in the now-discarded theories of [[pleomorphism (microbiology)|pleomorphism]] promoted by [[Günther Enderlein]], notably in his 1925 book ''Bakterien-Cyklogenie''.

In January 2014 prominent live blood proponent and teacher Robert O. Young was arrested and charged for practising medicine without a license,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.10news.com/news/north-county-holistic-care-provider-robert-young-faces-charges-012414|title=North County holistic care provider Robert Young pleads not guilty to multiple charges|author=Steve Fiorina|work=[[KGTV|10News]]|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2014 Errol Denton, a former student of his, a UK live blood practitioner, was convicted on nine counts in a rare prosecution under the [[Cancer Act 1939]],&lt;ref name=quackery /&gt; followed in May 2014 by another former student, Stephen Ferguson.

==Overview==

Proponents believe that live blood analysis provides information "about the state of the immune system, possible vitamin deficiencies, amount of toxicity, pH and mineral imbalance, areas of concern and weaknesses, fungus and yeast." Some even claim it can "spot cancer and other degenerative immune system diseases up to two years before they would otherwise be detectable" or say they can diagnose "lack of oxygen in the blood, low trace minerals, lack of exercise, too much alcohol or yeast, weak kidneys, bladder or spleen."&lt;ref name="ernst"/&gt; Practitioners include alternative medicine providers such as nutritionists, herbologists, naturopaths, and chiropractors.&lt;ref name="CLIA"/&gt;

[[Dark field microscopy]] is useful to enhance contrast in unstained samples, but live blood analysis is not proven to be useful for any of its claimed indications. Two journal articles published in the alternative medical literature found that darkfield microscopy seemed unable to detect cancer, and that live blood analysis lacked reliability, [[Inter-rater reliability|reproducibility]], and [[sensitivity and specificity]].&lt;ref name=El-Safadi2005&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=El-Safadi S, Tinneberg HR, von Georgi R, Münstedt K, Brück F |title=[Does dark field microscopy according to Enderlein allow for cancer diagnosis?

Ernst describes live blood analysis as a "fraudulent" means of convincing patients to buy [[dietary supplement]]s.&lt;ref name="ernst"&gt;{{cite news | last = Ernst |first = Edzard |authorlink = Edzard Ernst | date = 2005-07-12| url= https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,1526339,00.html | title = Intrigued by the spectacular claims made for Live Blood Analysis? Don't be. It doesn't work | work= [[The Guardian]] | accessdate= 2008-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Quackwatch]] has been critical of live blood analysis, noting dishonesty in the claims brought forward by its proponents.&lt;ref name="lowell"&gt;{{cite web | last = Lowell | first = James | date = November 1986| url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/livecell2.html | title = Live Cell Analysis: High-Tech Hokum | publisher = [[Quackwatch]]| accessdate = 2008-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative medicine popularizer [[Andrew Weil]] dismissed live blood analysis as "completely bogus", writing: "Dark-field microscopy combined with live blood analysis may sound like cutting-edge science, but it's old-fashioned hokum. Don't buy into it."&lt;ref name="weil"&gt;{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Weil | authorlink = Andrew Weil | work = [[Arizona Daily Star]] | date = September 11, 2007 | accessdate = November 9, 2009 | title = Ask Dr. Weil | url = http://www.azstarnet.com/allheadlines/200252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common diagnoses==
There are several common diagnoses by the LBA practitioners that are actually based on observation of artifacts normally found in microscopy, and ignorance of basic biological science:&lt;ref name=LBAclaims&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patterson|first1=Thomas|title=The Pseudoscience of Live Blood Cell Analysis|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|volume=36|issue=November/December|pages=43–45|year=2012|publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MCrislip&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/live-blood-analysis-the-modern-auguries/|title=Live Blood Analysis: The Modern Auguries|author=Crislip, Mark|authorlink=Mark Crislip|publisher=Science-Based Medicine|date=13 February 2009|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Acid in the blood:  When the [[red blood cells]] stack on top of one another and appear like stacks of coins, it is called ‘[[rouleaux]]’ formation.   By observation of the rouleaux, the LBA practitioners diagnose ‘acid in the blood’, while other practitioners suggest a weak pancreas.  Rouleaux of red blood cells under the microscope is an artifact which occurs when the blood sample at the edge of the coverslip starts to dry out; where a large number of red blood cells clump together; or when the blood starts to clot when contacted with the glass.  These artifacts are observed in only small, selected areas on the slide, while near the center of the slide the red blood cells are free floating.  Blood [[acidosis]] is a severe illness and can not be diagnosed by observation of blood, nor treated by dietary supplements.&lt;ref name=LBAclaims/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCrislip/&gt;
*Uric acid crystals and/or cholesterol plaques:  Microscopic splinters of glass are often present when the slide is not cleaned thoroughly.  Observation of such shards is claimed by the LBA practitioners to be [[uric acid]] crystals or [[cholesterol]] plaques, and thus to be indicative of ‘acid imbalance, [[stress (biology)|stress]] or poor lymphatic circulation’ among other vague ailments.  Uric acid crystals and cholesterol plaques, if present, are not visible in the blood samples.&lt;ref name=LBAclaims/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCrislip/&gt;
*Parasites:  Particles of dirt and debris, commonly found on glass slides not cleaned thoroughly, or slightly deformed red blood cells are mistaken to be [[parasites]].  Patients with parasites in the blood stream would be very sick and in need of immediate medical care, not by nutritional or herbal supplements or life style change as often recommended by LBA practitioners.&lt;ref name=LBAclaims/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCrislip/&gt;
*Bacteria and yeast:  LBA practitioners observe small irregular shape on the red blood [[cell membrane]], a common artifact, and claim it represents [[bacteria]] or [[yeasts]] budding off the edge of the cell membrane.  This claim violates the basic principle of [[biology]] that each [[living organism]] is unique and can not be transformed from one into another.  Presence of bacteria or yeasts in the blood indicates the patient has suffered from [[septicemia]] and is in danger of developing [[sepsis]], a life-threatening condition.&lt;ref name=LBAclaims/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCrislip/&gt;
*Fermentations:  Light spots on some red blood cells are identified by LBA practitioners as fermentations caused by high [[sugar]] content in the blood.  [[Fermentation (food)|Fermentation]] is a chemical reaction of breaking down sugar into [[alcohol]] and [[carbon dioxide]] [[catalysis|catalyzed]] by [[enzymes]] produced in yeast.  The red blood cells are not yeasts and cannot ferment sugar.&lt;ref name=LBAclaims/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCrislip/&gt; 

==Regulatory issues==

In 1996, the Pennsylvania Department of Laboratories informed three Pennsylvania chiropractors that Infinity2's "Nutritional Blood Analysis" could not be used for diagnostic purposes unless they maintain a laboratory that has both state and federal certification for complex testing.&lt;ref name="wlazelek"&gt;{{cite news| last = Wlazelek | first = A. | title = Chiropractors cease blood cell show and tell. State restricts the use of magnified images to sell vitamins, supplements | work= The Morning Call | date= 1996-04-12 | page= B6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[Health and Human Services]] Office of the Inspector General issued a report on regulation of "unestablished laboratory tests" that focused on live blood cell analysis and the difficulty of regulating unestablished tests and laboratories.&lt;ref name="CLIA"/&gt;

In 2002, an Australian [[naturopath]] was convicted and fined for [[false advertising|falsely claiming]] that he could diagnose illness using live blood analysis&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite news| publisher = [[Abc.net.au]] | title = Former Lismore naturopath fined over newspaper ads | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200205/s562909.htm | date = 2002-05-24 | accessdate = 2008-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the death of a patient. He was acquitted of [[manslaughter]]. He subsequently changed his name and was later banned from practice for life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/national/court-orders-life-ban-on-naturopath/2008/04/03/1207249393632.html Court orders life ban on naturopath], Brisbane Times, April 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[Rhode Island]] Department of Health ordered a [[chiropractor]] to stop performing live blood analysis. An attorney for the State Board of Examiners in Chiropractic Medicine described the test as "useless" and a "money-making scheme... The point of it all is apparently to sell nutritional supplements." A state medical board official said that live blood analysis has no discernible value, and that the public "should be very suspicious of any practitioner who offers this test."&lt;ref name="freyer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Freyer |first=Felice |date=2005-06-21 |title=Chiropractor ordered to halt blood tests |work=[[Providence Journal]] |url=http://www.projo.com/news/content/projo_20050621_chiro21.2342042.html |accessdate=2008-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907103944/http://www.projo.com/news/content/projo_20050621_chiro21.2342042.html |archivedate=2006-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the UK [[General Medical Council]] suspended a doctor's licence to practise after he used live blood analysis to diagnose patients with [[Lyme disease]]. The doctor accepted he had been practising "bad medicine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MPTS Fitness to Practise Panel, 17th Oct - 2nd Nov 2011 &amp; 6th - 8th Aug 2012|url=http://www.mpts-uk.org/static/documents/content/Minutes_PUBLISHABLE_2825184_August_2012_Wright.pdf|work=Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, following several [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] adjudications &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASA rulings on "live blood"| URL=http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications.aspx?SearchTerms=%22live%20blood%22#results | accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; against claims made by LBA practitioners, the [[Committee of Advertising Practice]] added new guidelines to their [http://cap.org.uk/Advice-Training-on-the-rules/Advice-Online-Database.aspx AdviceOnline] database advising what LBA marketers may claim in their advertising material. These state that "CAP is yet to see any evidence for the efficacy of this therapy which, without rigorous evidence to support it, should be advertised on an availability-only platform." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Therapies: Live Blood Analysis | url=http://cap.org.uk/Advice-Training-on-the-rules/Advice-Online-Database/Therapies-Live-Blood-Analysis.aspx | date = 2013-07-03 | accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of these practitioners, Errol Denton, who practised out of a serviced office in Harley Street, was prosecuted in December 2013 under the [[Cancer Act 1939]], and chose to use a [[Freeman on the Land]] defence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10510345/Harley-Street-practitioner-claimed-he-could-cure-cancer-and-HIV-with-lifestyle-changes-and-herbs-court-hears.html Harley Street practitioner claimed he could cure cancer and HIV with lifestyle changes and herbs, court hears], [[Daily Telegraph]], Dec 11 2013&lt;/ref&gt; On March 20, 2014 he was convicted on nine counts under the [[Cancer Act 1939]] and fined £9,000 plus around £10,000 in costs.&lt;ref name=quackery&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/10732023/Duped-by-the-blood-analyst-who-says-he-can-cure-cancer.html |title=Duped by the 'blood analyst' who says he can cure cancer |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=30 March 2014 |first=Robert |last=Mendick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edp24.co.uk/mobile/news/crime/woodford_green_harley_street_worker_handed_19k_court_bill_after_claiming_he_could_cure_cancer_and_hiv_with_lifestyle_changes_1_3459178 Eastern Daily Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321025146/http://www.edp24.co.uk/mobile/news/crime/woodford_green_harley_street_worker_handed_19k_court_bill_after_claiming_he_could_cure_cancer_and_hiv_with_lifestyle_changes_1_3459178 |date=2014-03-21 }}, 20 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, Denton was further convicted of two counts of "engaging in unfair commercial practice" and one of "selling food not of the quality demanded", for selling a bottle of [[colloidal silver]] drink to an undercover [[trading standards]] officer in February 2016, after examining a drop of her blood and from it claiming that she had dislocated her shoulder.&lt;ref name="Herbert"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herbert|first1=Tom|title=Homeopath who claimed he could cure cancer with food faces jail|url=http://metro.co.uk/2018/04/03/homeopath-claimed-cure-cancer-food-faces-jail-7437803/|accessdate=3 April 2018|work=Metro|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CauseLIst"&gt;{{cite web|title=Blackfriars / T20160730|url=http://causelist.org/blackfriars/T20160730/|website=causelist.org|accessdate=3 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was made the subject of a [[Criminal Behaviour Order]], fined £2,250, and ordered pay £15,000 in costs.&lt;ref name="ASA-2018-04"&gt;{{cite web|title=ASA welcomes fine and Criminal Behaviour Order handed to Mr Errol Denton|url=https://www.asa.org.uk/news/asa-welcomes-fine-and-criminal-behaviour-order-handed-to-mr-errol-denton.html|publisher=[[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]]|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maria Cristina Richaud''' is an Argentinian psychologist. She was born and raised up in Buenos Aires, and in 1970 received her bachelor's degree in psychology from [[University of Buenos Aires]], and her doctorate in cognitive psychology from the same university 4 years later. Then she became a researcher at [[National Council of Scientific and Technological Research]]. Her work are mainly about parenting, stress, coping, attachment, and social cognitive variables in children and adolescents. Later she devoted herself to the study of children at risk from poverty.

Richaud served as the vice-president and then president of the [[Argentine Association of Behavioral Sciences]]. She co-founded ''Interdisciplinaria: Revista de Psicología y Ciencias Afines'' in 1980. She also served as the director of Interdisciplinary Center for Research in Mathematical and Experimental Psychology from 2003. In 2013 she and [[Fons van de Vijver]] received [[APA Award for Distinguished Contributions to the International Advancement of Psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/a0034763 | volume=68 | title=María Cristina Richaud: Award for Distinguished Contributions to the International Advancement of Psychology. | journal=American Psychologist | pages=749–751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''maxilla''' (plural: ''maxillae'' {{IPAc-en|m|æ|k|ˈ|s|ɪ|l|iː}})&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'' 2nd edition, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; in animals is the upper fixed [[bone]] of the [[jaw]] formed from the fusion of two maxillary bones. The upper jaw includes the [[hard palate]] in the front of the [[mouth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webster.com Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Illustrated Anatomy of the Head and Neck |last=Fehrenbach |last2=Herring |publisher=Elsevier |year=2012 |page=55 |isbn=978-1-4377-2419-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two maxillary bones are fused at the intermaxillary suture, forming the [[anterior nasal spine]]. This is similar to the [[mandible]] (lower jaw), which is also a fusion of two mandibular bones at the [[mandibular symphysis]]. The mandible is the movable part of the jaw.

==Structure==
[[File:Sobo 1909 100 - Palatine process of maxilla.png|thumb|right|Interior surface of maxilla]]
In humans, the maxilla consists of:
* The [[body of the maxilla]]
* Four [[Process (anatomy)|processes]]
** The [[Zygomatic process of maxilla|zygomatic process]]
** The [[frontal process of maxilla]]
** The [[alveolar process]]
** The [[palatine process]]
* The [[Infraorbital foramen]]
* The [[maxillary sinus]]
* The [[incisive foramen]]

=== Articulations ===
Each maxilla articulates with nine bones:
* two of the [[Human cranium|cranium]]: the [[Frontal bone|frontal]] and [[ethmoid]]
* seven of the [[face]]: the [[nasal bone|nasal]], [[zygomatic bone|zygomatic]], [[lacrimal bone|lacrimal]], [[inferior nasal concha]], [[Palatine bone|palatine]], [[vomer]], and the adjacent fused maxilla.

Sometimes it articulates with the orbital surface, and sometimes with the [[lateral pterygoid plate]] of the [[sphenoid bone|sphenoid]].

===Development===
[[File:Gray161.png|thumb|Figure 5: Anterior surface of maxilla at birth.]] 
[[File:Gray162.png|thumb|Figure 6: Inferior surface of maxilla at birth.]] 
The maxilla is ossified in membrane. [[Franklin P. Mall|Mall]] and Fawcett maintain that it is ossified from ''two'' centers only, one for the maxilla proper and one for the premaxilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Franklin P. |last=Mall |title=On ossification centers in human embryos less than one hundred days old |journal=[[American Journal of Anatomy]] |year=1906 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=433–458 |doi=10.1002/aja.1000050403 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Edward |last=Fawcett |title=Some Notes on the Epiphyses of the Ribs |journal=[[Journal of Anatomy and Physiology]] |year=1911 |volume= 45 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=172–178 |pmc=1288875 |pmid=17232872 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These centers appear during the sixth week of [[prenatal development]] and unite in the beginning of the third month, but the suture between the two portions persists on the palate until nearly middle life. Mall states that the frontal process is developed from both centers.

The maxillary sinus appears as a shallow groove on the nasal surface of the bone about the fourth month of development, but does not reach its full size until after the second dentition.

The maxilla was formerly described as ossifying from six centers, viz., 
* one, the ''orbitonasal,'' forms that portion of the body of the bone which lies medial to the infraorbital canal, including the medial part of the floor of the orbit and the lateral wall of the nasal cavity; 
* a second, the ''zygomatic,'' gives origin to the portion which lies lateral to the infraorbital canal, including the zygomatic process; 
* from a third, the ''palatine,'' is developed the palatine process posterior to the incisive canal together with the adjoining part of the nasal wall; 
* a fourth, the ''premaxillary,'' forms the incisive bone which carries the incisor teeth and corresponds to the premaxilla of the lower vertebrates; 
* a fifth, the ''nasal,'' gives rise to the frontal process and the portion above the canine tooth; 
* and a sixth, the ''infravomerine,'' lies between the palatine and premaxillary centers and beneath the vomer; this center, together with the corresponding center of the opposite bone, separates the incisive canals from each other.

====Changes by age====
At birth the transverse and antero-posterior diameters of the bone are each greater than the vertical.

The frontal process is well-marked and the body of the bone consists of little more than the alveolar process, the teeth sockets reaching almost to the floor of the orbit.

The maxillary sinus presents the appearance of a furrow on the lateral wall of the nose. In the adult the vertical diameter is the greatest, owing to the development of the alveolar process and the increase in size of the sinus.

==Function==
[[File:FracLeftNasalBoneMark.png|thumb|Fracture of the left lacrimal / maxillary bone]]
The [[alveolar process]] of the maxillae holds the upper teeth, and is referred to as the maxillary arch. Each maxilla attaches laterally to the [[zygomatic bone]]s (cheek bones).

Each maxilla assists in forming the boundaries of three cavities:
* the roof of the [[mouth]]
* the floor and lateral wall of the [[nasal cavity]]
* the wall of the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]]

Each maxilla also enters into the formation of two fossae: the [[Infratemporal fossa|infratemporal]] and [[Pterygopalatine fossa|pterygopalatine]], and two [[fissures]], the [[inferior orbital]] and [[pterygomaxillary]].
-When the tender bones of the upper jaw and lower nostril are severely or repetitively damaged, at any age the surrounding cartilage can begin to deteriorate just as it does after death.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Clinical significance==
[[Maxilla fracture]]s is a form of [[facial fracture]] caused by a [[bone fracture|fracture]]. A maxilla fracture is often the result of [[facial trauma]] such as [[violence]], [[Falling (accident)|falls]] or [[automobile accidents]]. Maxilla fractures are classified according to the [[Le Fort fracture of skull|Le Fort classification]].

==In other animals==
Sometimes (e.g. in bony fish), the maxilla is called "upper maxilla", with the mandible being the "lower maxilla". Conversely, in birds the upper jaw is often called "upper mandible".

In most vertebrates, the foremost part of the upper jaw, to which the [[incisor]]s are attached in mammals consists of a separate pair of bones, the [[premaxilla]]e. These fuse with the maxilla proper to form the bone found in humans, and some other mammals. In [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]], [[amphibian]]s, and [[reptile]]s, both maxilla and premaxilla are relatively plate-like bones, forming only the sides of the upper jaw, and part of the face, with the premaxilla also forming the lower boundary of the [[nostril]]s. However, in mammals, the bones have curved inward, creating the palatine process and thereby also forming part of the roof of the mouth.&lt;ref name="VB"&gt;{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 217–43|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bird]]s do not have a maxilla in the strict sense; the corresponding part of their [[beak]]s (mainly consisting of the premaxilla) is called "upper mandible".

[[Chondrichthyes|Cartilaginous fish]], such as sharks, also lack a true maxilla. Their upper jaw is instead formed from a [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] bar that is not [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with the bone found in other vertebrates.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt;

'''Medicine''' is the [[science]] and practice of the [[diagnosis]], [[therapy|treatment]], and [[Preventive medicine|prevention]] of [[disease]]. Medicine encompasses a variety of [[health care]] practices evolved to maintain and restore [[health]] by the [[prevention (medical)|prevention]] and [[therapy|treatment]] of [[illness]]. Contemporary medicine applies [[biomedical sciences]], [[biomedical research]], [[medical genetics|genetics]], and [[medical technology]] to [[diagnosis (medical)|diagnose]], treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through [[pharmaceutical]]s or [[surgery]], but also through therapies as diverse as [[psychotherapy]], [[splint (medicine)|external splints and traction]], [[medical device]]s, [[biologic medical product|biologics]], and [[Radiation (medicine)|ionizing radiation]], amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/medicine | title=Dictionary, medicine | accessdate=2 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicine has existed for thousands of years, during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the [[religion|religious]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] beliefs of local culture. For example, a [[medicine man]] would apply herbs and say [[prayer]]s for healing, or an ancient philosopher and [[physician]] would apply [[bloodletting]] according to the theories of [[humorism]]. In recent centuries, since the [[history of science|advent of modern science]], most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both [[fundamental science|basic]] and [[applied science|applied]], under the [[umbrella term|umbrella]] of '''medical science'''). While stitching technique for [[surgical suture|sutures]] is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the [[cytology|cellular]] and [[molecular medicine|molecular]] level in the tissues being stitched arises through science.

Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as [[traditional medicine]] and [[folk medicine]]. They remain commonly used with or instead of scientific medicine and are thus called [[alternative medicine]]. For example, evidence on the effectiveness of [[acupuncture]] is "variable and inconsistent" for any condition,&lt;ref name=Colquhoun2013&gt;{{cite journal | last = Colquhoun | first = D | authorlink = David Colquhoun |author2= [[Steven Novella|Novella S]] | pmid = 23709076 | url = http://www.dcscience.net/Colquhoun-Novella-A&amp;A-2013.pdf | format = PDF | title = Acupuncture is a theatrical placebo: the end of a myth | journal = Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia | volume = 116 | issue = 6 | year = 2013 | pages = 1360–1363 | doi=10.1213/ANE.0b013e31828f2d5e}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner.&lt;ref name="nciacupuncture"&gt;{{cite web|title=Acupuncture (PDQ®)|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/acupuncture/healthprofessional/page6|publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]]|accessdate=15 Sep 2013|date=2005-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, treatments outside the bounds of safety and efficacy are termed [[quackery]].

==Clinical practice==
[[File:The Doctor Luke Fildes crop.jpg|thumb|alt=Oil painting of medicine in the age of colonialism|''The Doctor'' by [[Sir Luke Fildes]] (1891)]]
Medical availability and clinical practice varies across the world due to regional differences in culture and technology. Modern scientific medicine is highly developed in the [[Western world]], while in [[developing country|developing countries]] such as parts of Africa or Asia, the population may rely more heavily on [[traditional medicine]] with limited evidence and efficacy and no required formal training for practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=WHO Dept. of Essential Drugs and Medicines Policy |year=2002 |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/67294 |title=Traditional medicine: growing needs and potential |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the [[developed country|developed world]] however, [[evidence-based medicine]] is not universally used in clinical practice; for example, a 2007 survey of literature reviews found that about 49% of the interventions lacked sufficient evidence to support either benefit or harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=El Dib RP, Atallah AN, Andriolo RB |title=Mapping the Cochrane evidence for decision making in health care |journal=J Eval Clin Pract |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=689–692 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17683315 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2753.2007.00886.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern clinical practice, physicians personally assess patients in order to [[medical diagnosis|diagnose]], treat, and prevent disease using clinical judgment. The [[doctor-patient relationship]] typically begins an interaction with an examination of the patient's [[medical history]] and [[medical record]], followed by a medical interview&lt;ref name=Coulehan_2005&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Coulehan JL, Block MR | title=The Medical Interview: Mastering Skills for Clinical Practice | edition = 5th | publisher = F. A. Davis | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-8036-1246-4 | oclc=232304023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[physical examination]]. Basic diagnostic [[medical device]]s (e.g. [[stethoscope]], [[tongue depressor]]) are typically used. After examination for [[Medical sign|signs]] and interviewing for [[symptoms]], the doctor may order [[medical test]]s (e.g. [[blood test]]s), take a [[biopsy]], or prescribe [[pharmaceutical drug]]s or other therapies. [[Differential diagnosis]] methods help to rule out conditions based on the information provided. During the encounter, properly informing the patient of all relevant facts is an important part of the relationship and the development of trust. The medical encounter is then documented in the medical record, which is a legal document in many jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=AHIMA2005&gt;
{{cite journal | author = Addison K, Braden JH, Cupp JE, Emmert D, Hall LA, Hall T, Hess B, Kohn D, Kruse MT, McLendon K, McQueary J, Musa D, Olenik KL, Quinsey CA, Reynolds R, Servais C, Watters A, Wiedemann LA, Wilkins M, Wills M, Vogt NE | title = Update: Guidelines for Defining the Legal Health Record for Disclosure Purposes | journal = Journal of AHIMA | volume =  76| issue = 8 | pages = 64A–G | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16245584 | url = http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/ahima/bok1_027921.hcsp?dDocName=bok1_027921 | archivedate = 9 March 2008 | first21 = NE | first20 = M | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080309002938/http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/ahima/bok1_027921.hcsp?dDocName=bok1_027921 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Follow-ups may be shorter but follow the same general procedure, and specialists follow a similar process. The diagnosis and treatment may take only a few minutes or a few weeks depending upon the complexity of the issue.

The components of the medical interview&lt;ref name=Coulehan_2005/&gt; and encounter are:
* Chief complaint (CC): the reason for the current medical visit. These are the '[[symptom]]s.' They are in the patient's own words and are recorded along with the duration of each one. Also called 'chief concern' or 'presenting complaint'.
* History of present [[illness]] (HPI): the chronological order of events of symptoms and further clarification of each symptom. Distinguishable from history of previous illness, often called past medical history (PMH). [[Medical history]] comprises HPI and PMH.
* Current activity: occupation, hobbies, what the patient actually does.
* [[Medication]]s (Rx): what drugs the patient takes including [[Medical prescription|prescribed]], [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]], and [[Home remedy|home remedies]], as well as alternative and [[Herbalism|herbal medicines/herbal remedies]]. [[Allergy|Allergies]] are also recorded.
* Past medical history (PMH/PMHx): concurrent medical problems, past hospitalizations and operations, injuries, past [[infectious disease]]s or [[vaccination]]s, history of known allergies.
* Social history (SH): birthplace, residences, marital history, social and economic status, habits (including [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], medications, [[tobacco smoking|tobacco]], alcohol).
* [[Family history (medicine)|Family history]] (FH): listing of diseases in the family that may impact the patient. A [[family tree]] is sometimes used.
* Review of systems (ROS) or ''systems inquiry'': a set of additional questions to ask, which may be missed on HPI: a general enquiry (have you noticed any [[weight loss]], change in sleep quality, fevers, lumps and bumps? etc.), followed by questions on the body's main organ systems ([[human heart|heart]], [[human lung|lungs]], [[digestive tract]], [[Urinary system|urinary tract]], etc.).

The [[physical examination]] is the examination of the patient for [[medical sign]]s of disease, which are objective and observable, in contrast to symptoms which are volunteered by the patient and not necessarily objectively observable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/161858.php What Are Symptoms? What Are Signs?]. [[Medical News Today]].&lt;/ref&gt; The healthcare provider uses the senses of sight, hearing, touch, and sometimes smell (e.g., in infection, [[uremia]], [[diabetic ketoacidosis]]). Four actions are the basis of physical examination: [[inspection (medicine)|inspection]], [[palpation]] (feel), [[percussion (medicine)|percussion]] (tap to determine resonance characteristics), and [[auscultation]] (listen), generally in that order although auscultation occurs prior to percussion and palpation for abdominal assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.lww.com/nursing/Fulltext/2006/11002/Assessing_patients_effectively__Here_s_how_to_do.5.aspx |title=Assessing patients effectively: Here's how to do the basic four techniques |journal=Nursing2014 |volume=8 |issue=2 |page=6 |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clinical examination involves the study of:
* Vital signs including height, weight, body temperature, [[blood pressure]], [[pulse]], respiration rate, and hemoglobin [[oxygen saturation]]
* General appearance of the patient and specific indicators of disease (nutritional status, presence of jaundice, pallor or [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]])
* [[human skin|Skin]]
* Head, [[eye]], [[ear]], nose, and throat (HEENT)
* [[Cardiovascular]] ([[heart]] and [[blood vessel]]s)
* [[Respiratory]] (large airways and [[Human lung|lungs]])
* [[Abdomen]] and [[rectum]]
* Genitalia (and pregnancy if the patient is or could be pregnant)
* [[Musculoskeletal]] (including spine and extremities)
* [[Neurological]] (consciousness, awareness, brain, vision, [[cranial nerves]], spinal cord and [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral nerves]])
* [[Psychiatry|Psychiatric]] (orientation, [[mental state examination|mental state]], evidence of abnormal perception or thought).

It is to likely focus on areas of interest highlighted in the medical history and may not include everything listed above.

The treatment plan may include ordering additional [[medical laboratory]] tests and [[medical imaging]] studies, starting therapy, referral to a specialist, or watchful observation. Follow-up may be advised. Depending upon the [[health insurance]] plan and the [[managed care]] system, various forms of "[[utilization review]]", such as prior authorization of tests, may place barriers on accessing expensive services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grembowski DE, Diehr P, Novak LC, etal |title=Measuring the "managedness" and covered benefits of health plans |journal=Health Serv Res |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=707–734 |date=August 2000 |pmid=10966092 |pmc=1089144 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medical decision-making (MDM) process involves analysis and synthesis of all the above data to come up with a list of possible diagnoses (the [[differential diagnosis|differential diagnoses]]), along with an idea of what needs to be done to obtain a definitive diagnosis that would explain the patient's problem.

On subsequent visits, the process may be repeated in an abbreviated manner to obtain any new history, symptoms, physical findings, and lab or imaging results or specialist consultations.

Contemporary medicine is in general conducted within [[health care system]]s. Legal, [[credential]]ing and financing frameworks are established by individual governments, augmented on occasion by international organizations, such as churches. The characteristics of any given health care system have significant impact on the way medical care is provided.

From ancient times, Christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals and the [[Catholic Church]] today remains the largest non-government provider of medical services in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Blainey, Geoffrey |year=2011 |title=A Short History of Christianity |publisher=Penguin Viking |oclc=793902685 |title-link=A Short History of Christianity }}{{page needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced industrial countries (with the exception of the [[United States]])&lt;ref name="IOM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2004/Insuring-Americas-Health-Principles-and-Recommendations.aspx |title=Insuring America's Health: Principles and Recommendations |publisher=Institute of Medicine at the National Academies of Science |date=14 Jan 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019103757/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2004/Insuring-Americas-Health-Principles-and-Recommendations.aspx |archivedate=19 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ccuhc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm |title=The Case For Single Payer, Universal Health Care for the United States |publisher=Cthealth.server101.com|accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[Developing country|developing countries]] provide medical services through a system of [[universal health care]] that aims to guarantee care for all through a [[single-payer health care]] system, or compulsory private or co-operative [[health insurance]]. This is intended to ensure that the entire population has access to medical care on the basis of need rather than ability to pay. Delivery may be via private medical practices or by state-owned hospitals and clinics, or by charities, most commonly by a combination of all three.

Most [[tribe|tribal]] societies provide no guarantee of healthcare for the population as a whole. In such societies, healthcare is available to those that can afford to pay for it or have self-insured it (either directly or as part of an employment contract) or who may be covered by care financed by the government or tribe directly.

[[File:Drug ampoule JPN.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=collection of glass bottles of different sizes|Modern drug [[ampoule]]s]]

Transparency of information is another factor defining a delivery system. Access to information on conditions, treatments, quality, and pricing greatly affects the choice by patients/consumers and, therefore, the incentives of medical professionals. While the US healthcare system has come under fire for lack of openness,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; new legislation may encourage greater openness. There is a perceived tension between the need for transparency on the one hand and such issues as patient confidentiality and the possible exploitation of information for commercial gain on the other.

Provision of medical care is classified into primary, secondary, and tertiary care categories.

[[Primary care]] medical services are provided by [[physician]]s, [[physician assistant]]s, [[nurse practitioner]]s, or other health professionals who have first contact with a patient seeking medical treatment or care. These occur in physician offices, [[clinic]]s, [[nursing home]]s, schools, home visits, and other places close to patients. About 90% of medical visits can be treated by the primary care provider. These include treatment of acute and chronic illnesses, [[preventive care]] and [[health education]] for all ages and both sexes.

[[Secondary care]] medical services are provided by [[medical specialist]]s in their offices or clinics or at local community hospitals for a patient referred by a primary care provider who first diagnosed or treated the patient. Referrals are made for those patients who required the expertise or procedures performed by specialists. These include both [[ambulatory care]] and [[inpatient]] services, [[Emergency department]]s, [[intensive care medicine]], surgery services, [[physical therapy]], [[childbirth|labor and delivery]], [[endoscopy]] units, diagnostic [[Medical laboratory|laboratory]] and [[medical imaging]] services, [[Hospice care|hospice]] centers, etc. Some primary care providers may also take care of hospitalized patients and deliver babies in a secondary care setting.

[[Tertiary care]] medical services are provided by specialist hospitals or regional centers equipped with diagnostic and treatment facilities not generally available at local hospitals. These include [[trauma center]]s, [[burn (injury)|burn]] treatment centers, advanced [[neonatology]] unit services, [[organ transplant]]s, high-risk pregnancy, [[radiation therapy|radiation]] [[oncology]], etc.

Modern medical care also depends on information – still delivered in many health care settings on paper records, but increasingly nowadays by [[Electronic health record|electronic means]].

In low-income countries, modern healthcare is often too expensive for the average person. International healthcare policy researchers have advocated that "user fees" be removed in these areas to ensure access, although even after removal, significant costs and barriers remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Laokri S, Weil O, Drabo KM, Dembelé SM, Kafando B, Dujardin B |title=Removal of user fees no guarantee of universal health coverage: observations from Burkina Faso |journal=Bull.

[[Separation of prescribing and dispensing]] is a practice in medicine and pharmacy in which the [[physician]] who provides a [[medical prescription]] is independent from the  [[pharmacist]] who provides the [[prescription drug]]. In the [[Western world]] there are centuries of tradition for separating pharmacists from physicians. In Asian countries it is traditional for physicians to also provide drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chou|first=Y.

Working together as an [[interdisciplinary team]], many highly trained [[health profession]]als besides medical practitioners are involved in the delivery of modern health care. Examples include: [[nurse]]s, [[emergency medical technician]]s and paramedics, laboratory scientists, [[pharmacists]], [[podiatry|podiatrists]], [[physiotherapists]], [[respiratory therapists]], [[speech therapy|speech therapists]], [[occupational therapy|occupational therapists]], radiographers, [[dietitian]]s, and [[bioengineering|bioengineers]], [[surgeons]], [[surgeon's assistant]], [[surgical technologist]].

The scope and sciences underpinning human medicine overlap many other fields. [[Dentistry]], while considered by some a separate discipline from medicine, is a medical field.

A patient admitted to the hospital is usually under the care of a specific team based on their main presenting problem, e.g., the cardiology team, who then may interact with other specialties, e.g., surgical, radiology, to help diagnose or treat the main problem or any subsequent complications/developments.

Physicians have many specializations and subspecializations into certain branches of medicine, which are listed below. There are variations from country to country regarding which specialties certain subspecialties are in.

The main branches of medicine are:
* Basic sciences of medicine; this is what every physician is educated in, and some return to in [[Biomedical research#Preclinical research|biomedical research]]
* [[Medical specialties]]
* [[Interdisciplinary sub-specialties of medicine|Interdisciplinary fields]], where different medical specialties are mixed to function in certain occasions.

===Basic sciences===
* ''[[Anatomy]]'' is the study of the physical structure of [[organism]]s. In contrast to ''macroscopic'' or ''gross anatomy'', ''cytology'' and ''histology'' are concerned with microscopic structures.
* ''[[Biochemistry]]'' is the study of the chemistry taking place in living organisms, especially the structure and function of their chemical components.
* ''[[Biomechanics]]'' is the study of the structure and function of biological systems by means of the methods of [[Mechanics]].
* ''[[Biostatistics]]'' is the application of statistics to biological fields in the broadest sense. A knowledge of biostatistics is essential in the planning, evaluation, and interpretation of medical research. It is also fundamental to [[epidemiology]] and evidence-based medicine.
* ''[[Biophysics]]'' is an interdisciplinary science that uses the methods of [[physics]] and [[physical chemistry]] to study biological systems.
* ''[[Cell biology|Cytology]]'' is the microscopic study of individual [[cell (biology)|cells]].
[[File:Albert Edelfelt - Louis Pasteur - 1885.jpg|thumb|''[[Louis Pasteur]]'', as portrayed in his laboratory, 1885 by [[Albert Edelfelt]]]]
* ''[[Embryology]]'' is the study of the early development of organisms.
* ''[[Endocrinology]]'' is the study of hormones and their effect throughout the body of animals.
* ''[[Epidemiology]]'' is the study of the demographics of disease processes, and includes, but is not limited to, the study of epidemics.
* ''[[Genetics]]'' is the study of genes, and their role in [[biological inheritance]].
* ''[[Histology]]'' is the study of the structures of [[biological tissue]]s by light [[microscopy]], [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]] and [[immunohistochemistry]].
* ''[[Immunology]]'' is the study of the [[immune system]], which includes the innate and adaptive immune system in humans, for example.
* ''[[Medical physics]]'' is the study of the applications of physics principles in medicine.
* ''[[Microbiology]]'' is the study of [[microorganism]]s, including [[protozoa]], [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]], and [[virus]]es.
* ''[[Molecular biology]]'' is the study of molecular underpinnings of the process of [[DNA replication|replication]], [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] of the genetic material.
* ''[[Neuroscience]]'' includes those disciplines of science that are related to the study of the [[nervous system]]. A main focus of neuroscience is the [[biology]] and physiology of the human brain and [[spinal cord]]. Some related clinical specialties include [[neurology]], [[neurosurgery]] and [[psychiatry]].
* ''[[Nutrition science]]'' (theoretical focus) and ''[[dietetics]]'' (practical focus) is the study of the relationship of food and drink to health and disease, especially in determining an optimal diet. Medical nutrition therapy is done by dietitians and is prescribed for [[diabetes]], [[cardiovascular disease]]s, weight and eating [[mental illness|disorders]], allergies, [[malnutrition]], and [[neoplasia|neoplastic]] diseases.
* ''[[Pathology as a science]]'' is the study of disease—the causes, course, progression and resolution thereof.
* ''[[Pharmacology]]'' is the study of drugs and their actions.
* ''[[Photobiology]]'' is the study of the interactions between [[non-ionizing radiation]] and living organisms.
* ''[[Physiology]]'' is the study of the normal functioning of the body and the underlying regulatory mechanisms.
* ''[[Radiobiology]]'' is the study of the interactions between [[ionizing radiation]] and living organisms.
* ''[[Toxicology]]'' is the study of hazardous effects of drugs and [[poison]]s.

===Specialties===
{{Main|Medical specialty}}
In the broadest meaning of "medicine", there are many different specialties. In the UK, most specialities have their own body or college, which have its own entrance examination. These are collectively known as the Royal Colleges, although not all currently use the term "Royal". The development of a speciality is often driven by new technology (such as the development of effective anaesthetics) or ways of working (such as emergency departments); the new specialty leads to the formation of a unifying body of doctors and the prestige of administering their own examination.

Within medical circles, specialities usually fit into one of two broad categories: "Medicine" and "Surgery." "Medicine" refers to the practice of non-operative medicine, and most of its subspecialties require preliminary training in Internal Medicine. In the UK, this was traditionally evidenced by passing the examination for the Membership of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] (MRCP) or the equivalent college in Scotland or Ireland. "Surgery" refers to the practice of operative medicine, and most subspecialties in this area require preliminary training in General Surgery, which in the UK leads to membership of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] (MRCS). At present, some specialties of medicine do not fit easily into either of these categories, such as radiology, pathology, or anesthesia. Most of these have branched from one or other of the two camps above; for example anaesthesia developed first as a [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] of the Royal College of Surgeons (for which MRCS/FRCS would have been required) before becoming the [[Royal College of Anaesthetists]] and membership of the college is attained by sitting for the examination of the Fellowship of the Royal College of Anesthetists (FRCA).

====Surgical specialty====
{{Main|Surgery}}
[[File:Surgeons at Work.jpg|thumb|Surgeons in an [[operating room]]]]
'''Surgery''' is an ancient medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate or treat a [[pathological]] condition such as [[disease]] or [[injury]], to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example, [[Perforated eardrum|a perforated ear drum]]). Surgeons must also manage pre-operative, post-operative, and potential surgical candidates on the hospital wards. Surgery has many sub-specialties, including ''[[general surgery]], [[Ophthalmic Surgery|ophthalmic surgery]], [[cardiovascular surgery]], [[colorectal surgery]], [[neurosurgery]], [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]], [[oncologic surgery]], [[orthopedic surgery]], [[otolaryngology]], [[plastic surgery]], [[podiatric surgery]], [[transplant surgery]], [[trauma surgery]], [[urology]], [[vascular surgery]], and [[pediatric surgery]].'' In some centers, [[anesthesiology]] is part of the division of surgery (for historical and logistical reasons), although it is not a surgical discipline. Other medical specialties may employ surgical procedures, such as [[ophthalmology]] and [[dermatology]], but are not considered surgical sub-specialties per se.

Surgical training in the U.S. requires a minimum of five years of residency after medical school. Sub-specialties of surgery often require seven or more years. In addition, fellowships can last an additional one to three years. Because post-residency fellowships can be competitive, many trainees devote two additional years to research. Thus in some cases surgical training will not finish until more than a decade after medical school. Furthermore, surgical training can be very difficult and time-consuming.

====Internal specialty====
{{Main|Internal medicine}}
'''Internal medicine''' is the [[medical specialty]] dealing with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of adult diseases. According to some sources, an emphasis on internal structures is implied.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|five/000063883|internal medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, specialists in internal medicine are commonly called "internists." Elsewhere, especially in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations, such specialists are often called [[physician]]s.&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;{{cite book |author= Fowler, H.W. |title=A Dictionary of Modern English Usage (Wordsworth Collection) (Wordsworth Collection) |publisher=NTC/Contemporary Publishing Company|year= 1994|isbn=978-1-85326-318-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms, ''internist'' or ''physician'' (in the narrow sense, common outside North America), generally exclude practitioners of gynecology and obstetrics, pathology, psychiatry, and especially surgery and its subspecialities.

Because their patients are often seriously ill or require complex investigations, internists do much of their work in hospitals. Formerly, many internists were not subspecialized; such ''general physicians'' would see any complex nonsurgical problem; this style of practice has become much less common. In modern urban practice, most internists are subspecialists: that is, they generally limit their medical practice to problems of one organ system or to one particular area of medical knowledge. For example, [[gastroenterology|gastroenterologists]] and [[nephrology|nephrologists]] specialize respectively in diseases of the gut and the kidneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|archivedate=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and some other countries, specialist [[Pediatrics|pediatricians]] and [[Geriatrics|geriatricians]] are also described as ''specialist physicians'' (or internists) who have subspecialized by age of patient rather than by organ system. Elsewhere, especially in North America, general pediatrics is often a form of [[primary care physician|primary care]].

There are many subspecialities (or subdisciplines) of [[internal medicine]]:
{{refbegin|3}}
:*''[[Angiology]]/Vascular Medicine''
:*''[[Cardiology]]''
:*''[[Critical care medicine]]''
:*''[[Endocrinology]]''
:*''[[Gastroenterology]]''
:*''[[Geriatrics]]''
:*''[[Hematology]]''
:*''[[Hepatology]]''
:*''[[Infectious disease (medical specialty)|Infectious disease]]''
:*''[[Nephrology]]''
:*''[[Neurology]]''
:*''[[Oncology]]''
:*''[[Pediatrics]]''
:*''[[Pulmonology]]/Pneumology/Respirology/chest medicine''
:*''[[Rheumatology]]''
:*[[Sports Medicine]]{{refend}}

Training in internal medicine (as opposed to surgical training), varies considerably across the world: see the articles on ''[[medical education]]'' and ''[[physician]]'' for more details. In North America, it requires at least three years of residency training after medical school, which can then be followed by a one- to three-year fellowship in the subspecialties listed above. In general, resident work hours in medicine are less than those in surgery, averaging about 60 hours per week in the US. This difference does not apply in the UK where all doctors are now required by law to work less than 48 hours per week on average.

====Diagnostic specialties====
* ''[[Clinical laboratory]] sciences'' are the clinical diagnostic services that apply laboratory techniques to diagnosis and management of patients. In the United States, these services are supervised by a pathologist. The personnel that work in these [[medical laboratory]] departments are technically trained staff who do not hold medical degrees, but who usually hold an undergraduate [[medical technology]] degree, who actually perform the [[medical test|tests]], [[assay]]s, and procedures needed for providing the specific services. Subspecialties include [[transfusion medicine]], [[cellular pathology]], [[clinical chemistry]], [[hematology]], [[clinical microbiology]] and [[clinical immunology]].
* ''[[Pathology as a medical specialty]]'' is the branch of medicine that deals with the study of diseases and the morphologic, physiologic changes produced by them. As a diagnostic specialty, pathology can be considered the basis of modern scientific medical knowledge and plays a large role in [[evidence-based medicine]]. Many modern molecular tests such as [[flow cytometry]], [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), [[immunohistochemistry]], [[cytogenetics]], gene rearrangements studies and [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]] (FISH) fall within the territory of pathology.
* ''Diagnostic [[radiology]]'' is concerned with imaging of the body, e.g. by [[x-ray]]s, x-ray [[computed tomography]], [[ultrasonography]], and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] [[tomography]]. Interventional radiologists can access areas in the body under imaging for an intervention or diagnostic sampling.
* ''[[Nuclear medicine]]'' is concerned with studying human organ systems by administering radiolabelled substances (radiopharmaceuticals) to the body, which can then be imaged outside the body by a [[gamma camera]] or a PET scanner. Each radiopharmaceutical consists of two parts: a tracer that is specific for the function under study (e.g., neurotransmitter pathway, metabolic pathway, blood flow, or other), and a radionuclide (usually either a gamma-emitter or a positron emitter). There is a degree of overlap between nuclear medicine and radiology, as evidenced by the emergence of combined devices such as the PET/CT scanner.
* ''[[Clinical neurophysiology]]'' is concerned with testing the physiology or function of the central and peripheral aspects of the nervous system. These kinds of tests can be divided into recordings of: (1) spontaneous or continuously running electrical activity, or (2) stimulus evoked responses. Subspecialties include [[electroencephalography]], [[electromyography]], [[evoked potential]], [[nerve conduction study]] and [[polysomnography]]. Sometimes these tests are performed by techs without a medical degree, but the interpretation of these tests is done by a medical professional.

====Other major specialties====
The following are some major medical specialties that do not directly fit into any of the above-mentioned groups:
* ''[[Anesthesiology]]'' (also known as ''anaesthetics''): concerned with the perioperative management of the surgical patient. The anesthesiologist's role during surgery is to prevent derangement in the vital organs' (i.e. brain, heart, kidneys) functions and postoperative pain. Outside of the operating room, the anesthesiology physician also serves the same function in the labor and delivery ward, and some are specialized in critical medicine.
* ''[[Dermatology]]'' is concerned with the skin and its diseases. In the UK, dermatology is a subspecialty of general medicine.
* ''[[Emergency medicine]]'' is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of acute or life-threatening conditions, including [[physical trauma|trauma]], surgical, medical, pediatric, and psychiatric emergencies.
* ''[[Family medicine]]'', ''[[family practice]]'', ''[[general practice]]'' or ''primary care'' is, in many countries, the first port-of-call for patients with non-emergency medical problems. Family physicians often provide services across a broad range of settings including office based practices, emergency department coverage, inpatient care, and nursing home care.
[[File:Changing lives for girls and women every week (12330467294).jpg|thumb|[[Gynecologist]] Michel Akotionga of [[Ouagadougou]], [[Burkina Faso]]]]
* ''[[Obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]]'' (often abbreviated as ''[[OB/GYN]]'' (American English) or ''Obs &amp; Gynae'' (British English)) are concerned respectively with childbirth and the female reproductive and associated organs. [[Reproductive medicine]] and [[fertility medicine]] are generally practiced by gynecological specialists.
* ''[[Medical genetics]]'' is concerned with the diagnosis and management of hereditary disorders.
* ''[[Neurology]]'' is concerned with diseases of the nervous system. In the UK, neurology is a subspecialty of general medicine.
* ''[[Ophthalmology]]'' is exclusively concerned with the eye and ocular adnexa, combining conservative and surgical therapy.
* ''[[Pediatrics]]'' (AE) or ''paediatrics'' (BE) is devoted to the care of infants, children, and adolescents. Like internal medicine, there are many pediatric subspecialties for specific age ranges, organ systems, disease classes, and sites of care delivery.
* ''[[Pharmaceutical medicine]]'' is the medical scientific discipline concerned with the discovery, development, evaluation, registration, monitoring and medical aspects of marketing of medicines for the benefit of patients and public health.
* ''[[Physical medicine and rehabilitation]]'' (or ''physiatry'') is concerned with functional improvement after injury, illness, or [[congenital disorder]]s.
* ''[[Podiatric medicine]]'' is the study of, diagnosis, and medical &amp; surgical treatment of disorders of the foot, ankle, lower limb, hip and lower back.
* ''[[Psychiatry]]'' is the branch of medicine concerned with the [[biopsychosocial|bio-psycho-social]] study of the [[etiology]], diagnosis, treatment and prevention of [[cognitive]], [[perceptual]], [[emotional]] and [[behavioral]] disorders. Related non-medical fields include [[psychotherapy]] and [[clinical psychology]].
* ''[[Preventive medicine]]'' is the branch of medicine concerned with preventing disease.
** ''[[Community health]]'' or ''[[public health]]'' is an aspect of health services concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on [[population health]] analysis.

===Interdisciplinary fields=== &lt;!--Interdisciplinary sub-specialties of medicine redirects here--&gt;

* ''[[Gender-based medicine]]'' studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease.
* ''[[Hospice and Palliative Medicine]]'' is a relatively modern branch of clinical medicine that deals with pain and symptom relief and emotional support in patients with [[terminal illness]]es including cancer and [[heart failure]].
* ''[[Hospital medicine]]'' is the general medical care of hospitalized patients. Physicians whose primary professional focus is hospital medicine are called [[hospitalist]]s in the United States and [[Canada]]. The term Most Responsible Physician (MRP) or attending physician is also used interchangeably to describe this role.
* ''[[Laser medicine]]'' involves the use of lasers in the diagnostics or treatment of various conditions.
* ''[[Medical humanities]]'' includes the [[humanities]] ([[literature]], [[philosophy]], [[ethics]], history and religion), [[social science]] ([[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]]), and the arts ([[literature]], theater, film, and [[visual arts]]) and their application to [[medical education]] and practice.

==Education and legal controls==
{{Main|Medical education|Medical license}}
[[File:Medical students learning about stitches (2760577402).jpg|thumb|Medical students learning about stitches]]

Medical education and training varies around the world. It typically involves entry level education at a university [[medical school]], followed by a period of supervised practice or [[medical intern|internship]], or [[residency (medicine)|residency]]. This can be followed by postgraduate vocational training. A variety of teaching methods have been employed in medical education, still itself a focus of active research. In Canada and the United States of America, a [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree, often abbreviated M.D., or a [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] degree, often abbreviated as D.O. and unique to the United States, must be completed in and delivered from a recognized university.

Since knowledge, techniques, and medical technology continue to evolve at a rapid rate, many regulatory authorities require [[continuing medical education]]. Medical practitioners upgrade their knowledge in various ways, including [[medical journal]]s, seminars, conferences, and online programs.  A database of objectives covering medical knowledge, as suggested by national societies across the United States, can be searched at http://data.medobjectives.marian.edu/. &lt;ref name="medObjectives"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arbor S, Biala N, Brooks S | title = A searchable database of medical education objectives - creating a comparable gold standard | journal = BMC Med Educ | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 31–39 | year = 2018 | pmid = 29499684 | pmc = 5833091 | doi = 10.1186/s12909-018-1136-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Organización Médica Colegial de España.jpg|thumb|left|Headquarters of the [[Organización Médica Colegial de España]], which regulates the medical profession in Spain]]
In most countries, it is a legal requirement for a medical doctor to be licensed or registered. In general, this entails a medical degree from a university and accreditation by a medical board or an equivalent national organization, which may ask the applicant to pass exams. This restricts the considerable legal authority of the medical profession to physicians that are trained and qualified by national standards. It is also intended as an assurance to patients and as a safeguard against [[charlatan]]s that practice inadequate medicine for personal gain. While the laws generally require medical doctors to be trained in "evidence based", Western, or [[Hippocratic]] Medicine, they are not intended to discourage different paradigms of health.

In the European Union, the profession of doctor of medicine is regulated. A profession is said to be regulated when access and exercise is subject to the possession of a specific professional qualification.
The regulated professions database contains a list of regulated professions for doctor of medicine in the EU member states, EEA countries and Switzerland. This list is covered by the Directive 2005/36/EC.

Doctors who are negligent or intentionally harmful in their care of patients can face charges of [[medical malpractice]] and be subject to civil, criminal, or professional sanctions.

==Medical ethics==
{{main|Medical ethics}}
[[File:HippocraticOath.jpg|thumb|upright|A 12th-century [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] manuscript of the [[Hippocratic Oath]]]]
Medical ethics is a system of moral principles that apply values and judgments to the practice of medicine. As a scholarly discipline, medical ethics encompasses its practical application in clinical settings as well as work on its history, philosophy, theology, and sociology. Six of the values that commonly apply to medical ethics discussions are:
* [[Autonomy#Medicine|autonomy]] – the patient has the right to refuse or choose their treatment. (''Voluntas aegroti suprema lex''.)
* [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] – a practitioner should act in the best interest of the patient. (''Salus aegroti suprema lex''.)
* [[Justice (ethics)|justice]] – concerns the distribution of scarce health resources, and the decision of who gets what treatment (fairness and equality).
* [[Primum non nocere|non-maleficence]] – "first, do no harm" (''primum non-nocere'').
* [[respect for persons]] – the patient (and the person treating the patient) have the right to be treated with dignity.
* [[truth]]fulness and [[honesty]] – the concept of [[informed consent]] has increased in importance since the historical events of the [[Doctors' Trial]] of the Nuremberg trials, [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]], and others.

Values such as these do not give answers as to how to handle a particular situation, but provide a useful framework for understanding conflicts. When moral values are in conflict, the result may be an ethical [[dilemma]] or crisis. Sometimes, no good solution to a dilemma in medical ethics exists, and occasionally, the values of the medical community (i.e., the hospital and its staff) conflict with the values of the individual patient, family, or larger non-medical community. Conflicts can also arise between health care providers, or among family members. For example, some argue that the principles of autonomy and beneficence clash when patients refuse [[blood transfusions]], considering them life-saving; and truth-telling was not emphasized to a large extent before the HIV era.

==History==
{{Main|History of medicine|Timeline of medicine and medical technology}}
[[File:Imhotep-Louvre.JPG|thumb|left|Statuette of ancient Egyptian physician [[Imhotep]], the first physician from antiquity known by name.]]

===Ancient world===
[[Prehistoric medicine]] incorporated plants ([[herbalism]]), animal parts, and minerals. In many cases these materials were used ritually as magical substances by priests, [[shamans]], or [[medicine man|medicine men]]. Well-known spiritual systems include [[animism]] (the notion of inanimate objects having spirits), [[spiritualism]] (an appeal to gods or communion with ancestor spirits); [[shamanism]] (the vesting of an individual with mystic powers); and [[divination]] (magically obtaining the truth). The field of [[medical anthropology]] examines the ways in which culture and society are organized around or impacted by issues of health, health care and related issues.

Early records on medicine have been discovered from [[ancient Egyptian medicine]], [[Babylonian Medicine]], [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] medicine (in the [[Indian subcontinent]]), [[classical Chinese medicine]] (predecessor to the modern [[traditional Chinese medicine]]), and [[ancient Greek medicine]] and [[Medicine in ancient Rome|Roman medicine]].

In Egypt, [[Imhotep]] (3rd millennium BCE) is the first physician in history known by name. The oldest [[Egyptian medical papyri|Egyptian medical text]] is the ''[[Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus]]'' from around 2000 BCE, which describes gynaecological diseases. The ''[[Edwin Smith Papyrus]]'' dating back to 1600 BCE is an early work on surgery, while the ''[[Ebers Papyrus]]'' dating back to 1500 BCE is akin to a textbook on medicine.&lt;ref name="Acker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ackerknecht|first=Erwin|title=A Short History of Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Btx3M5t6lDEC&amp;pg=PA22|year=1982|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-2726-6|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, archaeological evidence of medicine in Chinese dates back to the [[Bronze Age]] [[Shang Dynasty]], based on seeds for herbalism and tools presumed to have been used for surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hong |first=Francis |title=History of Medicine in China |journal=McGill Journal of Medicine |year=2004 |volume=8 |issue=1 |page=7984 |url=http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/MJM/issues/v08n01/crossroads/hong.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201231218/http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/MJM/issues/v08n01/crossroads/hong.pdf |archivedate=1 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Huangdi Neijing]]'', the progenitor of Chinese medicine, is a medical text written beginning in the 2nd century BCE and compiled in the 3rd century.&lt;ref name="Unsc"&gt;{{cite book|last=Unschuld|first=Pual|title=Huang Di Nei Jing: Nature, Knowledge, Imagery in an Ancient Chinese Medical Text|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N2ZdrPCbpNIC&amp;pg=PR9|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-92849-7|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hippocrates introduced the [[Hippocratic Oath]] for physicians, which is still relevant and in use today, and was the first to categorize illnesses as [[Acute (medical)|acute]], [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]], [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] and epidemic, and use terms such as, "exacerbation, [[relapse]], resolution, crisis, [[paroxysm]], peak, and [[convalescence]]".&lt;ref name=garrison97&gt;{{cite book | last = Garrison | first = Fielding H. | year = 1966 | title = History of Medicine | publisher = W.B.

After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] and the onset of the [[Early Middle Ages]], the Greek tradition of medicine went into decline in Western Europe, although it continued uninterrupted in the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]].

Most of our knowledge of ancient [[Hebrew medicine]] during the [[1st millennium BC|1st&amp;nbsp;millennium&amp;nbsp;BC]] comes from the [[Torah]], i.e.&amp;nbsp;the Five Books of [[Moses]], which contain various health related laws and rituals.

The concept of hospital as institution to offer medical care and possibility of a cure for the patients due to the ideals of Christian charity, rather than just merely a place to die, appeared in the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''. University of Chicago Press. p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the concept of [[uroscopy]] was known to Galen, he did not see the importance of using it to localize the disease. It was under the Byzantines with physicians such of [[Theophilus Protospatharius]] that they realized the potential in uroscopy to determine disease in a time when no microscope or stethoscope existed. That practice eventually spread to the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Prioreschi, Plinio. 2004. A History of Medicine: Byzantine and Islamic medicine. Horatius Press. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 750 CE, the Muslim world had the works of Hippocrates, Galen and Sushruta translated into [[Arabic]], and [[Islamic medicine|Islamic physicians]] engaged in some significant medical research. Notable Islamic medical pioneers include the [[Persians|Persian]] [[polymath]], [[Avicenna]], who, along with Imhotep and Hippocrates, has also been called the "father of medicine".&lt;ref&gt;

In Europe, [[Charlemagne]] decreed that a hospital should be attached to each cathedral and monastery and the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] likened the [[Catholic Church and health care|activities of the Catholic Church in health care]] during the Middle Ages to an early version of a welfare state: "It conducted hospitals for the old and orphanages for the young; hospices for the sick of all ages; places for the lepers; and hostels or inns where pilgrims could buy a cheap bed and meal". It supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor. This welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and possessing large farmlands and estates. The [[Benedictine]] order was noted for setting up hospitals and infirmaries in their monasteries, growing medical herbs and becoming the chief medical care givers of their districts, as at the great [[Abbey of Cluny]]. The Church also established a network of [[cathedral schools]] and universities where medicine was studied. The [[Schola Medica Salernitana]] in Salerno, looking to the learning of [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Arab]] physicians, grew to be the finest medical school in Medieval Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Blainey, Geoffrey |year=2011 |title=A Short History of Christianity |publisher=Penguin Viking |pages=214–215 |oclc=793902685 |title-link=A Short History of Christianity }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church established universities which revived the study of sciences – drawing on the learning of Greek and Arab physicians in the study of medicine.]]

However, the fourteenth and fifteenth century [[Black Death]] devastated both the Middle East and Europe, and it has even been argued that Western Europe was generally more effective in recovering from the pandemic than the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dols has shown that the Black Death was much more commonly believed by European authorities than by Middle Eastern authorities to be contagious; as a result, flight was more commonly counseled, and in urban Italy quarantines were organized on a much wider level than in urban Egypt or Syria ({{cite book |author=Michael W. Dols |title=The Black Death in the Middle East |publisher=Princeton |year=1977 |pages=119, 285–290 |oclc=2296964 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; In the early modern period, important early figures in medicine and anatomy emerged in Europe, including [[Gabriele Falloppio]] and [[William Harvey]].

The major shift in medical thinking was the gradual rejection, especially during the [[Black Death]] in the 14th and 15th centuries, of what may be called the 'traditional authority' approach to science and medicine. This was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so, then that was the way it was, and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly (which was paralleled by a similar shift in European society in general – see [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]]'s rejection of [[Ptolemy]]'s theories on astronomy). Physicians like [[Vesalius]] improved upon or disproved some of the theories from the past. The main tomes used both by medicine students and expert physicians were [[Materia Medica]] and [[Pharmacopoeia]].

[[Andreas Vesalius]] was the author of ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'', an important book on [[human anatomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/books.htm |title=Page through a virtual copy of Vesalius's ''De Humanis Corporis Fabrica'' |publisher=Archive.nlm.nih.gov |accessdate=21 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteria and microorganisms were first observed with a microscope by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] in 1676, initiating the scientific field [[microbiology]].&lt;ref name=Brock&gt;{{cite book | editors= Madigan M, Martinko J | title = Brock Biology of Microorganisms | edition = 11th | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-13-144329-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Independently from [[Ibn al-Nafis]], [[Michael Servetus]] rediscovered the [[pulmonary circulation]], but this discovery did not reach the public because it was written down for the first time in the "Manuscript of Paris"&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelservetusresearch.com/ENGLISH/works.html Michael Servetus Research] Website with a graphical study on the Manuscript of Paris by Servetus&lt;/ref&gt; in 1546, and later published in the theological work for which he paid with his life in 1553. Later this was described by [[Renaldus Columbus]] and [[Andrea Cesalpino]]. [[Herman Boerhaave]] is sometimes referred to as a "father of physiology" due to his exemplary teaching in Leiden and textbook 'Institutiones medicae' (1708). [[Pierre Fauchard]] has been called "the father of modern dentistry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lynch CD, O'Sullivan VR, McGillycuddy CT | title = Pierre Fauchard: The 'Father of Modern Dentistry' | journal = British Dental Journal | volume = 201 | issue = 12 | pages = 779–781 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17183395 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bdj.4814350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
[[File:Paul-Louis Simond injecting plague vaccine June 4th 1898 Karachi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Paul-Louis Simond]] injecting a plague vaccine in Karachi, 1898]]

Veterinary medicine was, for the first time, truly separated from human medicine in 1761, when the French veterinarian [[Claude Bourgelat]] founded the world's first veterinary school in Lyon, France. Before this, medical doctors treated both humans and other animals.

Modern scientific [[biomedical research]] (where results are testable and [[reproducible]]) began to replace early Western traditions based on herbalism, the Greek "[[humorism|four humours]]" and other such pre-modern notions. The modern era really began with [[Edward Jenner]]'s discovery of the [[smallpox vaccine]] at the end of the 18th century (inspired by the method of [[inoculation]] earlier practiced in Asia), [[Robert Koch]]'s discoveries around 1880 of the transmission of disease by bacteria, and then the discovery of [[antibiotic]]s around 1900.

The post-18th century [[modernity]] period brought more groundbreaking researchers from Europe. From [[Germany]] and Austria, doctors [[Rudolf Virchow]], [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen]], [[Karl Landsteiner]] and [[Otto Loewi]] made notable contributions. In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Alexander Fleming]], [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], [[Francis Crick]] and [[Florence Nightingale]] are considered important. [[Spain|Spanish]] doctor [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] is considered the father of modern [[neuroscience]].

From New Zealand and Australia came [[Maurice Wilkins]], [[Howard Florey]], and [[Frank Macfarlane Burnet]].

Others that did significant work include [[William Williams Keen]], [[William Coley]], [[James D. Watson]] (United States); [[Salvador Luria]] (Italy); [[Alexandre Yersin]] (Switzerland); [[Kitasato Shibasaburō]] (Japan); [[Jean-Martin Charcot]], [[Claude Bernard]], [[Paul Broca]] (France); [[Adolfo Lutz]] (Brazil); [[Nikolai Korotkov]] (Russia); [[William Osler|Sir William Osler]] (Canada); and [[Harvey Cushing]] (United States).

[[File:Alexander Fleming.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Fleming]]'s discovery of penicillin in September 1928 marks the start of modern antibiotics.]]
As science and technology developed, medicine became more reliant upon [[medication]]s. Throughout history and in Europe right until the late 18th century, not only animal and plant products were used as medicine, but also human body parts and fluids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Peter |last=Cooper |title=Medicinal properties of body parts |journal=The Pharmaceutical Journal |year=2004 |volume=273 |issue=7330 |pages=900–902 |url=http://www.pharmj.com/editorial/20041218/christmas/p900bodyparts.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203131508/http://www.pharmj.com/Editorial/20041218/christmas/p900bodyparts.html |archivedate=3 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pharmacology]] developed in part from [[herbalism]] and some drugs are still derived from plants ([[atropine]], [[ephedrine]], [[warfarin]], [[aspirin]], [[digoxin]], [[vinca alkaloid|''vinca'' alkaloids]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = van Der Heijden|first1 = Robert|last2 = Jacobs|first2 = Denise I.|last3 = Snoeijer|first3 = Wim|last4 = Hallard|first4 = Didier|last5 = Verpoorte|first5 = Robert|year = 2004|title = The Catharanthus alkaloids: Pharmacognosy and biotechnology|journal = [[Current Medicinal Chemistry]]|volume = 11|issue = 5|pages = 607–628|pmid = 15032608|doi = 10.2174/0929867043455846}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[taxo]]l, [[hyoscine hydrobromide|hyoscine]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Atanasov AG, Waltenberger B, Pferschy-Wenzig EM, Linder T, Wawrosch C, Uhrin P, Temml V, Wang L, Schwaiger S, Heiss EH, Rollinger JM, Schuster D, Breuss JM, Bochkov V, Mihovilovic MD, Kopp B, Bauer R, Dirsch VM, Stuppner H | doi = 10.1016/j.biotechadv.2015.08.001 | title = Discovery and resupply of pharmacologically active plant-derived natural products: A review | journal = Biotechnol.

The first antibiotic was [[arsphenamine]] (Salvarsan) discovered by [[Paul Ehrlich]] in 1908 after he observed that bacteria took up toxic dyes that human cells did not. The first major class of [[antibiotic]]s was the [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfa drugs]], derived by German chemists originally from [[azo dye]]s.

Pharmacology has become increasingly sophisticated; modern [[biotechnology]] allows drugs targeted towards specific physiological processes to be developed, sometimes designed for compatibility with the body to reduce [[Side effect|side-effects]]. [[Genomics]] and knowledge of [[human genetics]] and [[human evolution]] is having increasingly significant influence on medicine, as the causative [[gene]]s of most monogenic [[genetic disorder]]s have now been identified, and the development of techniques in [[molecular biology]], [[evolution]], and [[genetics]] are influencing medical technology, practice and decision-making.

Evidence-based medicine is a contemporary movement to establish the most effective [[algorithms]] of practice (ways of doing things) through the use of [[systematic review]]s and [[meta-analysis]]. The movement is facilitated by modern global [[information science]], which allows as much of the available evidence as possible to be collected and analyzed according to standard protocols that are then disseminated to healthcare providers. The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] leads this movement. A 2001 review of 160 Cochrane systematic reviews revealed that, according to two readers, 21.3% of the reviews concluded insufficient evidence, 20% concluded evidence of no effect, and 22.5% concluded positive effect.&lt;ref name=Ezzo2001&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ezzo J, Bausell B, Moerman DE, Berman B, Hadhazy V | title = Reviewing the reviews.

==Traditional medicine==
{{main|Traditional medicine}}
Traditional medicine (also known as indigenous or folk medicine) comprises knowledge systems that developed over generations within various societies before the introduction of modern medicine. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defines traditional medicine as "the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness."&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/definitions/en/|title=Traditional Medicine: Definitions|date=2008-12-01|accessdate=2014-04-20|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Asia]]n and [[Africa]]n countries, up to 80% of the population relies on traditional medicine for their [[primary health care]] needs. When adopted outside of its traditional culture, traditional medicine is often called [[alternative medicine]].&lt;ref name = WHO/&gt; Practices known as traditional medicines include [[Ayurveda]], [[Siddha medicine]], [[Unani]], [[Ancient Iranian Medicine|ancient Iranian medicine]], [[Irani Traditional medicine|Irani]], [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Islamic medicine]], [[traditional Chinese medicine]], [[traditional Korean medicine]], [[acupuncture]], [[Muti]], [[Ifá]], and [[traditional African medicine]].

The WHO notes however that "inappropriate use of traditional medicines or practices can have negative or dangerous effects" and that "further research is needed to ascertain the efficacy and safety" of several of the practices and medicinal plants used by traditional medicine systems.&lt;ref name = WHO/&gt; The line between alternative medicine and [[quackery]] is a contentious subject.

Traditional medicine may include formalized aspects of folk medicine, that is to say longstanding remedies passed on and practised by lay people. Folk medicine consists of the [[healing]] practices and ideas of body [[physiology]] and [[health]] preservation known to some in a culture, transmitted informally as general knowledge, and practiced or applied by anyone in the culture having prior experience.&lt;ref&gt;Acharya, Deepak and Shrivastava Anshu (2008): Indigenous Herbal Medicines: Tribal Formulations and Traditional Herbal Practices, Aavishkar Publishers Distributor, Jaipur, India. {{ISBN|978-81-7910-252-7}}. pp. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; Folk medicine may also be referred to as traditional medicine, [[alternative medicine]], [[indigenous medicine]], or [[natural medicine]]. These terms are often considered interchangeable, even though some authors may prefer one or the other because of certain overtones they may be willing to highlight. In fact, out of these terms perhaps only ''indigenous medicine'' and ''traditional medicine'' have the same meaning as ''folk medicine'', while the others should be understood rather in a modern or modernized context.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health: [http://nccih.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/ What is CAM]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mezerein''' is a [[toxic]] [[diterpene]] [[ester]] found in the sap of ''[[Daphne mezereum]]'' and related plants. Plants of the genera ''[[Euphorbiaceae]]'' and ''[[Thymelaeaceae]]'' possess a wide variety of different [[phorbol]] esters, which share the capacity of mimicking diacylglycerol (DAG) and thus activating different isoforms of protein kinase C. Mezerein was first isolated in 1975. It has antileukemic properties in mice, but it is also defined as a weak promoter of skin cancers in the same species.&lt;ref name="Marit"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.thepoisongarden.co.uk/atoz/daphne_mezereum.htm|title = The Poison Garden |last = Robertson |first = John |publisher = Robbo Services Ltd. |work = The Poison Garden website|accessdate= 28 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All parts of the plants contain an acrid and irritant sap that contains mezerein, thought to be the principal poison. The sap is especially prevalent in the bark and berries.

Mezerein is highly liposoluble and can cause vomiting, diarrhea and burning of the mouth. When a large dose is taken, there can be shivering, dilation of the pupils, damage to the oral passages and the intestine and even death.
It can also irritate the skin, resulting in redness by slight damage of the veins. Because of causing this redness, the sap used to be applied as rouge.&lt;ref name="Marit" /&gt;

== History and alternative uses ==
Mezerein can be found in ''Daphne mezereum''.&lt;ref name="Marit" /&gt; This plant has been used to make dyes, treat rheumatism and indolent ulcers and as a cosmetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://practicalplants.org/wiki/Daphne_mezereum |title = Practical Plants |last = Plants |first = Practical |date = 12 September 2012 |work = Daphne mezereum |accessdate= 28 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Daphne+mezereum|title = Daphne mezereum - L. |publisher = Plants For A Future |year = 2012 |work = Plants For A Future |accessdate= 28 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In homeopathy, the plant is used to treat primarily skin disorders but is also prescribed to treat anxiety related to digestive disorders and congestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://beneforce.com/informationfaq/homeopathic/mezereum.htm|title = Mezereum Homeopathy Information |publisher = Beneforce |accessdate= 28 March 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the toxicity of the plant was discovered, these uses were abandoned. The toxicity also led to new uses. In extreme cases, the berries are used to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://fringe.davesource.com/Fringe/Information/Suicide_FAQ.html#Mezerein |title = Suicide Faq |last = Dybedahl |first = Calle |accessdate= 27 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mezerein and daphnetoxin ==
The toxins mezerein and [[daphnetoxin]] are both present in the genus ''[[Daphne]]''. Daphnetoxin has a structure similar to mezerein, with the phenyl-pentadienoyl component (top left of the mezerein structural diagram) missing. They are both PKC activators but with a different selectivity: mezerein exhibits antileukemic properties while daphnetoxin does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Saraiva L. |year= 2001|title= Differential Activation oby Daphnetoxin and Mezerein of PKC-Isotypes α, βI, δ and ζ|journal= Planta Medica|volume= 67 |issue= 9 |pages= 787–790 |publisher= Thieme|doi= 10.1055/s-2001-18843 |last2= Fresco |first2= Paula |last3= Pinto |first3= Eugénia |last4= Portugal |first4= Helena |last5= Gonçalves |first5= Jorge |pmid= 11745011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism of action ==

Mezerein is a second stage tumor promoter. According to the IPP model, [[tumorigenesis]] happens in three stages: [[tumor initiation|initiation]], [[tumor promotion|promotion]], and [[tumor progression|progression]]. In the first stage, initiation, a gene-mutation with change of function occurs. These mutations often occur in oncogenes or regulatory sequences. In the promotion stage, interaction with cellular signaling pathways takes place. This leads to growth advantage for initiated cells. In the last stage, progression, the tumor has become karyotypically instable: morphological changes in the normal chromosomal structure take place. This instability is caused by additional mutations. This leads to metastasis, hyperproliferation and loss of control by the cellular environment. There is an increased risk that the tumor cells will mutate other genes. Second stage tumor promoters like mezerein do not have the capacity to initiate tumors, but can create circumstances in which initiated cells are more susceptible to additional mutations or in which initiated cells have growth advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://blackboard.ru.nl/bbcswebdav/pid-1711347-dt-content-rid-4501832_2/courses/NWI-MOL054-2012-KW3-V/L7-8%20Chemical%20carcinogenesis%281%29.pdf |title = Chemical carcinogenesis |last = Koenderink |first = Jan |year = 2013 |accessdate= 1 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They do not cause mutations themselves: promotion happens through interference with cellular signaling pathways.

Mezerein and other [[phorbol]] esters interact with protein kinase C (PKC). Protein kinase C controls the [[cell cycle]], so chemicals that interact with it can have pro-proliferative or anti-proliferative effects. PKC is normally activated by [[diacyl glycerol]] (DAG). Upon DAG binding to PKC, PKC's affinity for Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and membrane [[phosphoinositol]]s is increased. After binding Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, the DAG-PKC-Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; complex is attached to the plasma membrane by binding to membrane phosphoinositols. Now, PKC can phosphorylate various substrates, affecting the activity of several intracellular pathways that regulate cell cycle and apoptosis among others. PKC binding to the plasma membrane is reversible, because after a short period of time DAG is enzymatically degraded, causing PKC to udergo a conformational change and detach from the membrane and stop phosphorylating substrates.

Mezerein binds to PKC instead of DAG. It has a higher affinity for PKC than DAG does, and it cannot be degraded as easily as DAG.  Therefore, when mezerein is bound, PKC remains in the active conformation much longer than it normally does. Furthermore, when mezerein has bound to PKC, PKC no longer requires Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; for activation. This causes overstimulation of the pathways PKC initiates, leading to more cellular proliferation and less apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Black A, Black J |year=2013|title=Protein kinase C signaling and cell cycle regulation. Review|journal= Front Immunol|volume=3|issue=423| doi=10.3389/fimmu.2012.00423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it seems that chronic activation of PKC leads to a negative effect, that is, apoptosis. Furthermore, high doses of mezerein have been used to terminally differentiate cancer cells, preventing their growth. Thus, mezerein can have both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic properties. Usually, low doses cause a beneficial effect and high doses cause a toxic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Huynh KM, Soh JW, Dash R, Sarkar D, Fisher PB, Kang D |year=2010|title= FOXM1 Expression Mediates Growth Suppression During Terminal Differentiation of HO-1 Human Metastatic Melanoma Cells|journal=J.

== Dose-response relationships ==

Mezerein has been shown to have two effects in chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF cells) that are associated with cancer. These effects are stimulation of 2-deoxy-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose (2-DG) transport and causing of [[fibronectin]] loss. These effects are known to correlate with tumorigenicity in mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Driedger, P  |author2=Blumberg, M.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year= 1980 |title= Structure-Activity Relationships in Chick Embryo Fibroblasts for Phorbol-related Diterpene Esters Showing Anomalous Activities in Vivo |journal= Cancer Research |issue= 40 |pages= 339–346 |publisher= American Association for Cancer Research |url= http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/40/2/339 |accessdate= 12 March 2013 |pmid= 7356517 |volume= 40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both effects are mediated by PKC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Tsuru|year= 2002|title= Role of PKC isoforms in glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes: insignificance of atypical PKC|journal=American Journal of Physiology. Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume= 238|issue= 2|pages= 338–345|publisher= American Physiological Society |doi= 10.1152/ajpendo.00457.2001 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Lee|year= 2004|title= Reactive oxygen species amplify protein kinase C signaling in high glucose-induced fibronectin expression by human peritoneal mesothelial cells|journal= Kidney International|volume= 65|issue= 4|pages= 1170–1179|pmid= 15086456 |doi= 10.1111/j.1523-1755.2004.00491.x |last2= Yu |first2= MR |last3= Song |first3= JS |last4= Ha |first4= H|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of mezerein to decrease fibronectin levels is 46-fold lower than its ability to stimulate 2-DG transport. In related compounds, the difference between the two effects is usually 2- to 9-fold. This may have something to do with the weak tumorigenicity of mezerein.

The shape of the 2-DG transport dose-response curve has an optimum at a mezerein concentration of approximately 50&amp;nbsp;ng/mL. This is atypical, since a dose-response curve usually is S-shaped. The explanation for this behaviour is unknown. Possibly, at high concentrations, mezerein is converted by enzymes that have low affinity for it. That would lower the effective concentration and thus decrease the effects. 
In this picture, a NOAE-level can be observed between mezerein concentrations of 0 to approximately 0.09&amp;nbsp;ng/mL. The concentration that gives half-maximal effects is reached for a low concentration of mezerein: about 0.7&amp;nbsp;ng/mL.

The shape of the fibronectin-decrease curve is more usual, although not quite: the separate parts of the curve are all more or less linear, which is not the case in an S-shaped curve. In this case, a maximum dose can be determined: above concentrations of about 103&amp;nbsp;ng/mL the effect remains more or less stable. A NOAE-level is visible for concentrations of up to 1&amp;nbsp;ng/mL of mezerein. The concentration that gives half-maximal effect is approximately 90&amp;nbsp;ng/mL. The difference with the half-maximal concentration for 2-DG transport is remarkable. Mezerein causes a 46-fold lower effect for fibronectin decrease than for 2-DG stimulation, and apparently only causes this effect at high concentrations. This might also correlate with mezerein being a weak tumor promotor.

The '''National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and Health''' ('''NACOSH''') was established under the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act|Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970]] to advise the Secretaries of [[United States Secretary of Labor|Labor]] and [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services]] on occupational safety and health programs and policies. Members of the twelve-person advisory committee are chosen on the basis of their knowledge and experience in occupational safety and health.

The twelve-member NACOSH has two members representing management, two members representing labor, two members representing the occupational health professions, two members representing the occupational safety professions and four members representing the public. Two of the health representatives and two of the public members are designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, although actual appointment of these members, as well as all other members, is by the Secretary of Labor. The members serve two-year terms.

The agency was established by Decree Number 48 of January 1990. The NDLEA is present in international airports, seaports and border crossing. It tries to eradicate [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] by destroying plantings. The NDLEA also targets the leaders of narcotics and money laundering organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Drug cultivation==

Former Chairman of NDLEA, Alhaji [[Ahmadu Giade]], described illicit drugs as "alien" to Nigeria. Cannabis, now locally grown in most states of the federation, was introduced to the country by foreigners. Ms Dagmar Thomas, the Country Representative of [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC), says Nigeria was one of the largest cannabis growers in Africa, with over 8% of the population abusing cannabis. Annual cannabis seizures increased from 126 metric tones in 2005 to 210 metric tones in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Drug trafficking==

The United States has donated full body scanning machines for the [[Lagos]], [[Kano]], [[Abuja]] and [[Port Harcourt]] international airports and has provided security training and orientation airport officers. The machines have proved effective in catching smugglers and couriers taking cocaine from Latin America to Europe by way of Nigeria. Between 2006 and June 2008 over 12,663 suspected drug dealers were arrested, with seizure of over 418.8 metric tonnes of various hard drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Drug Barons==

Speaking of efforts to go after the organizers of the trade, [[Ahmadu Giade]], chairman/chief executive officer of NDLEA in 2008 said the agency had seized N270 million worth of shares from drug barons, as well as cars, houses and other property worth hundreds of millions of Naira.&lt;ref name=newsw/&gt;

After a September 2009 meeting with the head of the Nigerian Immigration Service to discuss exchange of biometric data of convicted drug barons and traffickers, Giade said cooperation between the agencies would help deny passports to convicted drug barons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Controversy==

The [[U.S. Department of State]] notes that there have been credible allegations of drug-related corruption at NDLEA. In late November 2005 NDLEA Chairman [[Bello Lafiaji]] was dismissed by President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] due to allegations of corruption and replaced by Ahmadu Giade, a retired deputy commissioner of police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=Africa and the Middle East: Nigeria
 |publisher=United States Department of State
 |accessdate=2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bello Lafiaji’s continued vow and dedication to make life unbearable for drug merchants and strike them where it hurts the most made him a target of the drug baron as was evidenced in their connivance with some third party to frame him up in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;I Was Asked to Lie About Euros – Ex-NDLEA Employee: http://allafrica.com/stories/200911050171.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Bello Lafiaji was wrongly convicted on June 21, 2010 of conspiracy and conversion of 164,300 euros seized from a drug suspect in November 2005 when he was the Chairman of the NDLEA. He was sentenced to four years in prison together with his personal assistant. They were investigated by Nigeria’s Independent and Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC).&lt;ref&gt;Wrongly Convicted Database Record: http://forejustice.org/db/Lafiaji--Alhaji-Bello-.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Lafiaji appealed his conviction and on November 22, 2011, a three-judge panel of Nigeria’s Court of Appeal in Lagos overturned Lafiaji’s conviction in a unanimous decision and held that the prosecution failed to prove its cases against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt.&lt;ref name="thisdaylive.com"&gt;Appeal Court Sets Lafiaji Free: http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/appeal-court-sets-lafiaji-free/103461/&lt;/ref&gt;

Lafiaji was therefore discharged and acquitted by the Federal Court of Appeal Lagos, Nigeria.&lt;ref name="thisdaylive.com"/&gt;

In June 2003 the National Committee for the Reform of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency issued a report that identified a cartel of senior NDLEA members which arranged release of 197 convicted drug barons and couriers between 2005 and 2006, and recommended prosecution of these official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Nkisi''' or '''Nkishi''' (plural varies: ''minkisi'', ''zinkisi'', or ''nkisi'') are spirits, or [[Fetishism|an object that a spirit inhabits]]. It is frequently applied to a variety of objects used throughout the [[Congo Basin]] in [[Central Africa]] that are believed to contain spiritual powers or spirits. The term and its concept have passed with the [[Atlantic slave trade]] to the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://palomayombe.netfirms.com/beliefs.html|title=Palo Deities|date=13 April 2008|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413072928/http://palomayombe.netfirms.com/beliefs.html|archivedate=13 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
The current meaning of the term derives from the root, ''*-kitį''- referring to a spiritual entity, or material objects in which it is manifested or inhabits in Proto-Njila, an ancient subdivision of the [[Bantu language]] family.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Vansina, ''Paths in the Rainforest:  Toward a History of Political Tradition in Equatorial Africa'' (Madison:  University of Wisconsin Press, 1990), p. 146 and 297; but see also Vansina's corrective statements in ''How Societies Are Born:   Governance in West Central Africa Before 1600 (Charlottesville, VA and London:  University of Virginia Press, 2004), pp. 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its earliest attestations in [[Kikongo]] dialects in the early seventeenth century it was transliterated as "mokissie" (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]), as the mu- prefix in this noun class were still pronounced. It was reported by Dutch visitors to [[Kingdom of Loango|Loango]] in the 1668 book ''[[Description of Africa (1668 book)|Description of Africa]]'' as referring both to a material item and the spiritual entity that inhabits it.&lt;ref&gt;Olfert Dapper, ''[[Description of Africa (1668 book)|Naukeurige Beschrijvinge der Africa Gewesten]]'' (Amsterdam, 1668), p. 548 (see English translation in John Ogilby, ''Africa'' (London, 1670), p. 514).&lt;/ref&gt;  In the sixteenth century, when the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] was converted to [[Roman Catholic Church in Kongo|Christianity]], ''ukisi'' (a substance having characteristics of nkisi) was used to translate "holy" in the Kikongo [[Catechism]] of 1624.&lt;ref&gt;John Thornton, "The Development of an African Catholic Church in the Kingdom of Kongo, 1491-1750," ''Journal of African History'' 25 (1984):  156-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eighteenth century, the ''mu-'' prefix evolved into a simple nasal ''n-'', so the modern spelling is properly n'kisi, but many orthographies spell it nkisi (there is no language-wide accepted [[orthography]] of Kikongo).

==Use==
Close communication with ancestors and belief in the efficacy of their powers are closely associated with minkisi in [[Kongo people|Kongo]] tradition. Among the peoples of the [[Congo Basin]], especially the [[Bakongo]] and the [[Songye]] people of Kasai, exceptional human powers are frequently believed to result from some sort of communication with the dead. People known as [[nganga|banganga]]&lt;ref&gt;The plural varies according to dialect, can also be nganga with class 2 concords or zinganga.&lt;/ref&gt; (singular: [[nganga]]) work as healers, diviners, and mediators who defend the living against black magic (witchcraft) and provide them with remedies against diseases resulting either from witchcraft or the demands of [[bakisi]] (spirits), emissaries from the land of the dead.

Banganga harness the powers of bakisi and the dead by making minkisi. Minkisi are primarily containers - ceramic vessels, gourds, animal horns, shells, bundles, or any other object that can contain spiritually-charged substances. Even [[graves]] themselves, as the home of the dead and hence the home of bakisi, can be considered as minkisi. In fact, minkisi have even been described as portable graves, and many include earth or relics from the grave of a powerful individual as a prime ingredient. The powers of the dead thus infuse the object and allow the nganga to control it.&lt;ref&gt;Moncia Blackmun Visona, Robin Poynor, Herbert M Cole, ''A History of Art in Africa'' (New York:  Prentice-Hall, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The metal objects commonly pounded into the surface of the power figures represent the minkisis' active roles during ritual or ceremony. Each nail or metal piece represents a vow, a signed treaty, and efforts to abolish evil. Ultimately, these figures most commonly represent reflections upon socially unacceptable behaviors and efforts to correct them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/50013887|work=Power Figure (Nkisi N'Kondi: Mangaaka)|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The substances chosen for inclusion in minkisi are frequently called "''bilongo''" or "''milongo''" (singular ''nlongo'') a word often translated as "medicine."   However, their operation is not primarily pharmaceutical, as they are not applied to or ingested by those who are sick, and perhaps ''bilongo'' is more accurately translated as "therapeutic substances".  Rather they are frequently chosen for metaphoric reasons, for example, bird claws in order to catch wrongdoers, or because their names resemble characteristics of spirits in question.

Among the many common materials used in the minkisi were [[fruit]] ("luyala" in [[Kikongo]]), [[charcoal]] ("kalazima"), and [[mushrooms]] ("tondo").&lt;ref&gt;Wyatt MacGaffey, "Complexity, Astonishment and Power:  The Visual Vocabulary of Kongo ''Minkisi''" ''Journal of Southern African Studies''14:  188-204&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Minerals]] were collected from various places associated with the dead, such as earth collected from graves and riverbeds. White clay was also very important in the composition of minkisi due to the symbolic relationship of the color white and the physical aspects of dead skin as well as their moral rightness and spiritual positivity. White contrasted with black, the color of negativity. Some minkisi use red ochre as a coloring agent. The use of red is symbolic of the mediation of the powers of the dead.

Minkisi serve many purposes. Some are used in [[divination]] practices, rituals to eradicate evil or punish wrong-doers, and ceremonies for protective installments. Many are also used for healing, while others provide success in hunting or trade, among other things. Important minkisi are often credited with powers in multiple domains. Most famously, minkisi may also take the form of [[anthropomorphic]] or [[zoomorphic]] wooden carvings.

==Types==
[[File:Mangaaka.jpg|thumb|Nkisi Mangaaka power figure in [[Manchester Museum]]]]

Minkisi and the afflictions associated with them are generally classified into two types; the "of the above" and the "of the below". The above minkisi are associated with the [[sky]], [[rain]], and [[thunderstorms]]. The below minkisi are associated with the [[earth]] and [[body of water|waters]] on land. The above minkisi were considered masculine and were closely tied to violence and violent forces.&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Claude Dupré,"Les système des forces ''nkisi'' chez le Kongo d'après le troisième volume de K. Laman,"  ''Africa'' 45 (1975): 12-28&lt;/ref&gt; The minkisi of the above were largely used to maintain order, serve justice, and seal treaties.

[[Birds of prey]], [[lightning]], [[weapons]], and [[fire]] are all common themes among the minkisi of the above. They also affected the upper body. Head, neck, and chest pains were said to be caused by these nkisi figures. Some figures were in the form of animals. Most often these were dogs ("''kozo''"). Dogs are closely tied to the spiritual world in Kongo mythology. They live in two separate worlds; the village of the living, and the forest of the dead. ''Kozo'' figures were often portrayed as having two heads – this was symbolic of their ability to see both worlds.

==Nkondi==
{{Main|Nkondi}}

[[Nkondi]] (plural varies ''minkondi'', ''zinkondi'') are a subclass of minkisi that are considered aggressive.  Because many of the nkondi collected in the nineteenth century were activated by having nails driven into them, they were often called "nail fetishes" in travel writing, museum catalogs, and art history literature.  Many nkondi also feature reflective surfaces, such as mirrors, on their stomach areas or the eyes, which are held to be the means of vision in the spirit world.  Although they can be made in many forms, the ones featuring a human statue with nails are the best described in anthropological and scholarly literature.

Nkondi are invoked to search out wrongdoing, enforce oaths, and cause or cure sicknesses. Perhaps the most common use was the locating and punishing of criminals, by hunting down wrongdoers and to avenging their crimes.  An oath taker may declare him or herself vulnerable to the disease caused by an nkondi should he or she violate the oath.  People who fall sick with diseases known to be associated with a particular nkondi may need to consult the nganga responsible for mediating with that spirit to determine how to be cured.

Although nkisi nkondi have probably been made since at least the sixteenth century, the specifically nailed figures, which have been the object of collection in Western museums, nailed nkondi were probably made primarily in the northern part of the Kongo cultural zone in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

==Modern impact==

The nkisi figures brought back to Europe in the nineteenth century caused great interest in stimulating emerging trends in modern art, and Bantu themes previously considered primitive or gruesome were now viewed as aesthetically interesting. The pieces became influential in art circles and many were acquired by art museums. The intentions of the banganga who created minkisi were practical, that is their characteristics were dictated by the need of the object to do the work it was required to do—hence the nails which caused a sensation were never seen as decorative items but as a requirement of awakening the spirit; or the gestures were part of a substantial metaphor of gestures found in Kongo culture.&lt;ref&gt;Wyatt MacGaffey, "'Magic, or as we usually say 'Art': A Framework for Comparing African and European Art," in Enid Schildkrout and Curtis Keim, eds. ''The Scramble for Art in Central Africa,'' (Cambridge and New York:  Cambridge University Press, 1998) pp. 217-235.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently some modern artists have also been interested in creating nkisi of their own, most notably [[Renee Stout]], whose exhibition "Astonishment and Power" at the Smithsonian Institution coupled her own versions of nkisi with a commentary by noted anthropologist Wyatt MacGaffey.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Harris and Wyatt MacGaffey. eds. ''Astonishment and Power'' (London and Washington, DC:  Smithsonian Institution Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:A wireless nurse call pendant for wearing on the neck.png|thumb|right|200px|A wireless nurse call pendant for wearing on the neck.]] --&gt;
A '''nurse call button''' is a button or cord found in hospitals and nursing homes, at places where patients are at their most vulnerable, such as beside their bed and in the bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://intellisec.co.za/nurse-call/|title=Nurse Call|publisher=Intellisec}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It allows [[patient]]s in [[health care]] settings to alert a nurse or other health care staff member remotely of their need for help. When the button is pressed, a signal alerts staff at the [[nurse's station]], and usually, a [[nurse]] or [[nurse assistant]] responds to such a call. Some systems also allow the patient to speak directly to the staffer; others simply beep or buzz at the station, requiring a staffer to actually visit the patient's room to determine the patient's needs.

The call button provides the following benefits to patients:
*Enables a patient who is confined to bed and has no other way of communicating with staff to alert a nurse of the need for any type of assistance
*Enables a patient who is able to get out of bed, but for whom this may be hazardous, exhausting, or otherwise difficult to alert a nurse of the need for any type of assistance
*Provides the patient an increased sense of security

The call button can also be used by a health care staff member already with the patient to call for another when such assistance is needed, or by visitors to call for help on behalf of the patient.

==Laws and regulations==
Laws in most places require that a call button must be in reach of the patient at all times for example in the patients bed or on the table.  It is essential to patients in emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5fGwgp2PQ4gC&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=%22call+button%22nurse&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xC4-TJ7mJYO78gaRlYCaBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22call%20button%22nurse&amp;f=false |title=Back injury among healthcare workers: causes, solutions, and impacts - William Charney, Mary Anne Hudson - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also laws that vary by location setting the amount of time in which staff must respond to a call.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YlOP-QskSUC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=%22call+button%22nurse&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IkI-TNe5E8P48AaXvsGoBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22call%20button%22nurse&amp;f=false |title=Geriatric residential care - Robert D. Hill, Brian L. Thorn, John Bowling, Anthony Morrison - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the responsibility of nursing staff to explain to the patients that they have a call button and to teach them how to use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SmtjSD1x688C&amp;pg=PA1766&amp;dq=%22call+button%22nurse&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IkI-TNe5E8P48AaXvsGoBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22call%20button%22nurse&amp;f=false |title=Brunner and Suddarth's textbook of medical-surgical nursing - Lillian Sholtis Brunner, Suzanne C. Smeltzer, Brenda G. Bare, Janice L. Hinkle, Kerry H. Cheever - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2009-11-24 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overuse==
Some patients develop the habit of overusing a call button. This can lead staff to frustration, [[alarm fatigue]], up to and including ignoring or disregarding the patient's calls or not taking them very seriously. "Alarm fatigue" refers to the response - or lack of it - of nurses to more than a dozen types of alarms that can sound hundreds of times a day - and many of those calls are false alarms. Staff cannot ignore such calls, as doing so violates the law in most places. Sometimes, mental health professionals will work with such patients in order to curtail their use of the button to serious need.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

==System types==

===Basic===
The most basic system has nothing more than a button for the patient. When the button is pressed, nursing staff is alerted by a light and/or an audible sound at the nurse's station. This can only be turned off from the patient's bedside, thereby compelling staff to respond to the patient.

===Wireless nurse call===
Like hardwired systems, wireless types have the ability to alert nursing staff by sound, light or show messages in a terminal. An advantage is that there is less wiring during installation and reducing the costs.  The dome lights in the hallway still usually require wiring for power. Disadvantages of wireless systems include the requirement of batteries in each patient station that must be monitored and replaced over the life of the system, heightened risk of signal interference with other systems in the facility, and a limited selection among UL 1069 approved wireless systems.

===Intercoms===
In some facilities, often in hospitals, a more advanced system is included, in which staff from the nurse's station can communicate directly with patients via [[intercom]]. This has the advantage in which staff does not need to waste time walking to the patient's room to determine the reason the patient made the call, and they can determine by speaking to the patient whether the situation is urgent or if it can wait until later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xf6lnBtujFEC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=%22call+button%22nurse&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xC4-TJ7mJYO78gaRlYCaBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22call%20button%22nurse&amp;f=false |title=What Great Telecom Managers Know - Roger K. Yang - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2005-05-28 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the intercom system, the alert can be turned off from the nurse's station, allowing staff to avoid entry into the patient's room if it is determined that the patient's need can be met without doing so.

===Cell phone alerts===
Newer technology allows call buttons to reach [[cell phone]]-like devices carried around by nursing staff. Staffers can then answer the calls from wherever they are located within the facility, thereby improving the speed and efficiency in the response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthleadersmedia.com/content/TEC-92903/Dont-Call-It-a-Cell-Phone.html## |title=Don’t Call It a Cell Phone |publisher=Healthleadersmedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[stereotype]] is a generalized idea or image about a particular person or thing that is often oversimplified and offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/stereotype|title=Stereotype: Define Stereotype at Dictionary.com|last=|first=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|publisher=Random House, Inc|access-date=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypes are victims of prejudice when portrayals of a group are untrue of individual members.{{Clarify|reason=incoherent sentence|date=April 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferns|first=Terry|last2=Chojnacka|first2=Irena|date=2005|title=Nursing stereotypes: Angels, swingers, matrons and sinners|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Terry_Ferns/publication/7466751_Angels_and_swingers_matrons_and_sinners_nursing_stereotypes/links/004635236c76271fc1000000.pdf|journal=British Journal of Nursing|volume=14|issue=19|pages=1028|doi=10.12968/bjon.2005.14.19.19947|pmid=16301948|access-date=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nursing has been stereotyped throughout the history of the profession.

== Angel as a model nurse ==
[[File:The lady with the lamp Miss Nightingale at Scutari 1854.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Miss Nightingale at Scutari (1854)|The Lady with the Lamp]]'' — Florence Nightingale at [[Selimiye Barracks|Scutari]] in 1891 painted by [[Henrietta Rae]]]]
The image of a nurse as a ministering angel was promoted in the 19th century as a counter to the then image of a nurse as a dissolute drunk, exemplified by Dickens' [[Sarah Gamp]].  The model nurse in this image was moral, noble and religious, like a devout [[nun]]—chaste and abstemious—rather than an unpleasant [[witch]].  Her skills would be practical and her demeanour would be stoic and obedient.  [[Florence Nightingale]] promoted this image because, at the time, the idea of having female nurses attending the British army fighting the [[Crimean war]] was controversial, being thought immoral and revolutionary.&lt;ref name=ma&gt;{{citation |title=The legal and professional status of nursing |author=Mary Chiarella |chapter=The nurse as a ministering angel |pages=39–55 |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-443-07191-1 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Harmful effects ==
The media has a strong influence on public views, shaping the way the public values and treats professions in healthcare.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Saving Lives: Why the Media's Portrayal Nurses Puts Us All At Risk|last=Summers|first=Sandy|last2=Jacobs|first2=Harry|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=May 4, 2010|isbn=9781607146605|location=|pages=118–254}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, ''Saving Lives: Why the Media's Portrayal Nurses Puts Us All At Risk'' the authors Sandy Summers and Harry Jacobs discuss the many ill effects of the common stereotypes and how those are presented in today's media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/nurses-helpers-angels-or-something-more/?_r=1|title=Why Nurse Stereotypes Are Bad For Healthy|last=Brown|first=Theresa|date=July 1, 2009|website=Well Blogs|publisher=The New York Times|access-date=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors argue that offensive stereotypes such as handmaidens as well as sexual stereotypes leads media to overlook how important nurses are in healthcare, which generates a lack of respect. This disrespect and ignorance puts lives at risk because it hinders the job of the nurse, which in most cases is to save lives. The media projections of nurses can not only damage the respect from patient to nurse, or colleague to nurse, but can also impact the pride of the individual nurse. This could potentially lead a nurse to believe that they truly are working for a physician rather than with them, it could also discourage a nurse from standing their ground or demanding respect.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Spanish Medical Colleges Organization''' (''Organización Médical Colegial'' or ''OMC'') is a [[Spain|Spanish]] organization whose purpose is to regulate the Spanish medical profession.  The organization comprises the General Council of Official Medical Colleges (''Consejo General de Colegios Oficiales de Médicos'' or ''CGCOM'') and the Spanish regional [[medical colleges]]. Its role is to represent all the registered doctors, ensuring proper standards and promoting an ethical medical practice.

== Responsibilities ==
The CGCOM is the governing body that coordinates and represents the 52 local [[medical colleges]] at national and international levels. Its role is to represent, organize and defend the [[medical profession]].

Within the General Council, there is a Permanent Commission that is in charge of its administration and management. It manages any plans or projects agreed by the General Assembly and it also deals with administration and management issues of the General Council and its Human Resources department.  Currently there are five members of the Permanent Commission.

== Organization ==
The General Assembly is the highest power within the CGCOM and it is constituted by all 52 presidents of the local Medical Colleges, the members of the Permanent Commission, the national representatives of the College sections, representative members of the University, the scientific societies and other medical institutions. These medical institutions will join in following invitation by the assembly and will have a say but no right to vote.

The College sections are the different committees within each local College that get doctors together according to the modality of their medical practice. These committees are in charge of providing advice regarding their own specialties as well as organising suggestions or audits on the appropriate issues set up by nominated working groups.

The national representatives of the different '''college sections''' are as follows:
* Rural General Practice
* Inner city General Practice
* Dependent private practice
* Independent private practice
* Doctors with poor employment contracts
* Doctors in public administration
* Hospital doctors
* Training doctors
* Retired doctors

The OMC publishes books and journals that allow Spanish doctors to stay up to date with information and news on professional issues. It also publishes audits, documents and reports of general interest for the medical profession.

== History ==
In 1875, [[Alfonso XII of Spain|King Alfonso XII]] signed a law that made it compulsory for doctors working in [[Madrid]] and other Royal Places to be part of a register. This eventually became the basic structure for the creation of the medical colleges. The first Spanish medical colleges were formally established in 1894.

Compulsory registration for all doctors was debated between 1898 and 1900 but wasn’t established till 1917.

From 1893 there was a growing need amongst the medical profession to create a professional association and with this in mind, the local colleges were founded. The general organization of Medical Colleges (Organización Médical Colegial or OMC) was created soon after.

A school for orphans of medical parents (Colegio Principe de Asturias) was founded on May 15, 1917.

In October 1918, a first attempt to get the Heads of the Colleges to meet together had to be canceled due to the flu epidemic at the time; the unsuccessful date was chosen to coincide with a Medical National Meeting. It wasn’t until January 1919 that representatives from 33 local colleges finally met in the first ever general assembly. During that historic meeting they discussed issues such as pensions for the relatives of all those doctors deceased during the flu epidemic and also general issues about the medical profession. They created an executive committee based in Madrid and led by Dr Augusto Almazara and they agreed to meet again later on.

The Medical College of the city of Valencia requested an assembly of Spanish Medical Colleges and this was organized on 6 November 1920. On this date the Federation of Spanish Medical Colleges was founded creating a National Directory.

[[File:José Sanchis Bergón (1860-1926) retrato.jpg|thumb|200px|Dr. José Sanchís Bergón, first President of the OMC in Spain.]]
During the next several years the Federation evolved to establish some formal rules when it came to sanction doctors or to settle disagreement between the administration and the Colleges.

In January 1930, a General Assembly took place in Barcelona and it was chaired by Dr Perez Mateos. During this meeting a project to study the country medical needs (Proyecto de Previsión Nacional) and the statute were signed off. At this point, the General Council of the Medical Colleges becomes the absolute leader to organize a link between regional Colleges, public administration, official organizations and the registered doctors. From this date it becomes the only accepted official institution that represents doctors in Spain.

At the very beginning of the [[Spanish Civil War]], in July 1936, the Ministry of Work and Health dissolved the existing Colleges organization. By 1937, the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] had constituted the Association of Medical Professionals and by August, the general Government had created a Permanent Commission that reported directly to the Health General Headquarters.

After the war in 1940 and under the dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]], new laws for the functioning of the General Council of the Medical Colleges were instituted. In 1946 a new set of internal rules was established including 22 [[Deontological ethics|deontological]] principles.

Then in 1963 the rules of the Council were renewed introducing some fundamental changes. Under the new rules, the assembly was composed of the Presidents of each of the local colleges rather than by a representative group of their members. A voting system was introduced so that the registered doctors themselves could choose their representatives, who could then choose the members of the General Council.&lt;ref&gt;Libro de Actas de la Organización Médica Colegial. Madrid. 1963&lt;/ref&gt; The term Organización Médica Colegial was adopted as the name of this organization. By 1967 the official state document announced that the OMC is a guild within public law and is fully independent from the Health Administration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/1967/05/13/pdfs/A06396-06412.pdf Orden de 1 de abril de 1967 por la que se aprueba el nuevo texto del Reglamento de la Organización Médica Colegial. BOE. 1967/05/13; (114):6396-412.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of democracy in Spain brought intense political changes. In 1980 some new medical statutes were approved; the main novelty being that the representatives of the sections within the colleges had their right to voice and vote, and furthermore, all registered doctors can take part in general elections to choose the members of the Council. It becomes compulsory for every College to have its own named ethics group.

Further changes were introduced during the following years (2006–2010) which have greatly changed the organization. The most remarkable ones have been the tasks and responsibilities of the Autonomy Groups, the incorporation of medical students to the organization, the incompatibility of jobs within the Permanent Commission and the time limit to the responsibility posts. The aim remains to update the General Council to the reality of the current medical profession.

The organization was responsible for several public awareness efforts during the [[2009 flu pandemic]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Madrid|title=La OMC habla de "alarma exagerada" ante la gripe A|url=http://www.farodevigo.es/sociedad-cultura/2009/09/02/omc-habla-alarma-exagerada-gripe/364154.html|accessdate=25 January 2011|newspaper=farodevigo.es|date=September 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biosynthesis===
[[File:The biosynthesis of the different forms of OT.jpg|alt=The biosynthesis of the different forms of OT|left|thumb|The biosynthesis of the different forms of OT]]

The last hydrolysis that releases the active oxytocin nonapeptide is catalyzed by [[peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase]] (PAM).&lt;ref name="pmid2769155"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sheldrick EL, Flint AP | title = Post-translational processing of oxytocin-neurophysin prohormone in the ovine corpus luteum: activity of peptidyl glycine alpha-amidating mono-oxygenase and concentrations of its cofactor, ascorbic acid | journal = The Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 122 | issue = 1 | pages = 313–22 | date = July 1989 | pmid = 2769155 | doi = 10.1677/joe.0.1220313 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neural sources===
In the [[hypothalamus]], oxytocin is made in [[magnocellular neurosecretory cell]]s of the [[supraoptic nucleus|supraoptic]] and [[paraventricular nucleus|paraventricular]] nuclei, and is stored in [[Herring bodies]] at the axon terminals in the posterior pituitary. It is then released into the blood from the [[posterior pituitary|posterior lobe]] ([[neurohypophysis]]) of the [[pituitary gland]]. These [[axons]] (likely, but [[dendrites]] have not been ruled out) have collaterals that innervate neurons in the [[nucleus accumbens]], a brain structure where oxytocin receptors are expressed.&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ross HE, Cole CD, Smith Y, Neumann ID, Landgraf R, Murphy AZ, Young LJ | title = Characterization of the oxytocin system regulating affiliative behavior in female prairie voles | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 162 | issue = 4 | pages = 892–903 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19482070 | pmc = 2744157 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.05.055 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[endocrine system|endocrine]] effects of hormonal oxytocin and the cognitive or behavioral effects of oxytocin [[neuropeptide]]s are thought to be coordinated through its common release through these collaterals.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt; Oxytocin is also produced by some neurons in the paraventricular nucleus that project to other parts of the brain and to the spinal cord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Landgraf R, Neumann ID | title = Vasopressin and oxytocin release within the brain: a dynamic concept of multiple and variable modes of neuropeptide communication | journal = Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology | volume = 25 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 150–76 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15589267 | doi = 10.1016/j.yfrne.2004.05.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the species, oxytocin receptor-expressing cells are located in other areas, including the [[amygdala]] and [[Bed nucleus of the stria terminalis|bed nucleus]] of the [[stria terminalis]].

In the [[pituitary gland]], oxytocin is packaged in large, dense-core vesicles, where it is bound to [[neurophysin I]] as shown in the inset of the figure; neurophysin is a large [[peptide]] fragment of the larger precursor [[protein]] molecule from which oxytocin is derived by [[enzyme|enzymatic]] cleavage.

Secretion of oxytocin from the neurosecretory nerve endings is regulated by the electrical activity of the oxytocin cells in the hypothalamus. These cells generate [[action potential]]s that propagate down [[axon]]s to the nerve endings in the pituitary; the endings contain large numbers of oxytocin-containing vesicles, which are released by [[exocytosis]] when the nerve terminals are depolarised.

====Male====
The [[Leydig cells]] in some species have been shown to possess the biosynthetic machinery to manufacture testicular oxytocin ''de novo'', to be specific, in rats (which can synthesize vitamin C endogenously), and in guinea pigs, which, like humans, require an exogenous source of vitamin C (ascorbate) in their diets.&lt;ref name="pmid1456839"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kukucka MA, Misra HP | title = HPLC determination of an oxytocin-like peptide produced by isolated guinea pig Leydig cells: stimulation by ascorbate | journal = Archives of Andrology | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 185–90 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1456839 | doi = 10.3109/01485019208987723 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Female====
Oxytocin is synthesized by [[corpora lutea]] of several species, including ruminants and primates. Along with estrogen, it is involved in inducing the endometrial synthesis of [[prostaglandin F2alpha|prostaglandin&amp;nbsp;F&lt;sub&gt;2α&lt;/sub&gt;]] to cause regression of the corpus luteum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0739-7240(02)00161-3/fulltext&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution===
Virtually all [[vertebrate]]s have an oxytocin-like [[nonapeptide]] hormone that supports reproductive functions and a vasopressin-like nonapeptide hormone involved in water regulation. The two genes are usually located close to each other (less than 15,000 bases apart) on the same [[chromosome]], and are transcribed in opposite directions (however, in [[fugu]],&lt;ref name="pmid9356472"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Venkatesh B, Si-Hoe SL, Murphy D, Brenner S | title = Transgenic rats reveal functional conservation of regulatory controls between the Fugu isotocin and rat oxytocin genes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 94 | issue = 23 | pages = 12462–6 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9356472 | pmc = 25001 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.23.12462 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9356472 | bibcode = 1997PNAS...9412462V }}&lt;/ref&gt; the homologs are further apart and transcribed in the same direction).

The two genes are believed to result from a [[gene duplication]] event; the ancestral gene is estimated to be about 500 million years old and is found in [[cyclostomata]] (modern members of the [[Agnatha]]).&lt;ref name="Gimpl"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gimpl G, Fahrenholz F | title = The oxytocin receptor system: structure, function, and regulation | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 81 | issue = 2 | pages = 629–83 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11274341 | url = http://physrev.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11274341 | doi = 10.1152/physrev.2001.81.2.629 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological function==
Oxytocin has peripheral (hormonal) actions, and also has actions in the brain. Its actions are mediated by specific, [[oxytocin receptor]]s. The oxytocin receptor is a [[G-protein-coupled receptor]] that requires [[magnesium]] and [[cholesterol]]. It belongs to the [[rhodopsin]]-type (class I) group of G-protein-coupled receptors.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Studies have looked at oxytocin's role in various behaviors, including [[orgasm]], [[social recognition]], [[pair bond]]ing, [[anxiety]], and maternal behaviors.&lt;ref name="pmid19482229"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee HJ, Macbeth AH, Pagani JH, Young WS | title = Oxytocin: the great facilitator of life | journal = Progress in Neurobiology | volume = 88 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–51 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19482229 | pmc = 2689929 | doi = 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2009.04.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physiological{{anchor|Actions within the brain}}===
The [[peripheral]] actions of oxytocin mainly reflect secretion from the [[pituitary gland]]. The behavioral effects of oxytocin are thought to reflect release from centrally projecting oxytocin neurons, different from those that project to the [[pituitary gland]], or that are collaterals from them.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt; Oxytocin receptors are expressed by neurons in many parts of the brain and spinal cord, including the [[amygdala]], [[ventromedial hypothalamus]], [[septum]], [[nucleus accumbens]], and [[brainstem]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

* [[Lactation#Milk ejection reflex|Milk ejection reflex]]/Letdown reflex: in [[lactation|lactating]] ([[breastfeeding]]) mothers, oxytocin acts at the [[mammary gland]]s, causing milk to be 'let down' into [[areola|subareolar]] [[sinuses]], from where it can be excreted via the [[nipple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|976504|Human Milk and Lactation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suckling by the [[infant]] at the [[nipple]] is relayed by [[spinal nerves]] to the [[hypothalamus]]. The [[stimulation]] causes [[neurons]] that make oxytocin to fire action potentials in intermittent bursts; these bursts result in the secretion of pulses of oxytocin from the neurosecretory [[axon terminal|nerve terminals]] of the pituitary gland.
* [[Uterine contraction]]: important for [[cervical dilation]] before birth, oxytocin causes contractions during the second and third stages of [[labor (childbirth)|labor]].&lt;ref name="MacGill"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = MacGill | first1 = Markus | name-list-format = vanc | title=What is oxytocin, and what does it do?|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/275795.php|website=Medical News Today|publisher=Heath Line Media|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxytocin release during [[breastfeeding]] causes mild but often painful [[Muscle contraction|contraction]]s during the first few weeks of lactation. This also serves to assist the uterus in clotting the placental attachment point postpartum. However, in [[knockout mouse|knockout mice]] lacking the oxytocin receptor, reproductive [[behavior]] and [[parturition]] are normal.&lt;ref name="Takayanagi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takayanagi Y, Yoshida M, Bielsky IF, Ross HE, Kawamata M, Onaka T, Yanagisawa T, Kimura T, Matzuk MM, Young LJ, Nishimori K | title = Pervasive social deficits, but normal parturition, in oxytocin receptor-deficient mice | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 44 | pages = 16096–101 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16249339 | pmc = 1276060 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0505312102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..10216096T }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Due to its similarity to [[vasopressin]], it can reduce the excretion of [[urine]] slightly. In several species, oxytocin can stimulate sodium excretion from the kidneys (natriuresis), and, in humans, high doses can result in low sodium levels ([[hyponatremia]]).
* Cardiac effects: oxytocin and oxytocin receptors are also found in the [[heart]] in some rodents, and the hormone may play a role in the embryonal development of the heart by promoting [[cardiomyocyte]] differentiation.&lt;ref name="pmid12093924"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paquin J, Danalache BA, Jankowski M, McCann SM, Gutkowska J | title = Oxytocin induces differentiation of P19 embryonic stem cells to cardiomyocytes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 | issue = 14 | pages = 9550–5 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12093924 | pmc = 123178 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.152302499 | bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.9550P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15316117"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jankowski M, Danalache B, Wang D, Bhat P, Hajjar F, Marcinkiewicz M, Paquin J, McCann SM, Gutkowska J | title = Oxytocin in cardiac ontogeny | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 101 | issue = 35 | pages = 13074–9 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15316117 | pmc = 516519 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0405324101 | bibcode = 2004PNAS..10113074J }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the absence of either oxytocin or its receptor in knockout mice has not been reported to produce cardiac insufficiencies.&lt;ref name="Takayanagi" /&gt;

* Preparing fetal neurons for delivery: crossing the placenta, maternal oxytocin reaches the fetal brain and induces a switch in the action of neurotransmitter [[GABA]] from excitatory to inhibitory on fetal cortical neurons.

*Feeding: a 2012 paper suggested that oxytocin neurons in the para-ventricular hypothalamus in the brain may play a key role in suppressing appetite under normal conditions and that other hypothalamic neurons may trigger eating via inhibition of these oxytocin neurons.

====Bonding====
In the [[prairie vole]], oxytocin released into the brain of the female during sexual activity is important for forming a pair bond with her sexual partner. [[Vasopressin]] appears to have a similar effect in males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/high-on-fidelity |last=Vacek |first=Marla |year=2002 |title=High on Fidelity: What can voles teach us about monogamy? |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015201214/http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/14756 |archivedate=October 15, 2006 |work=American Scientist |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxytocin has a role in social behaviors in many species, so it likely also does in humans.

* [[Ingroup]] bonding: Oxytocin can increase positive attitudes, such as bonding, toward individuals with similar characteristics, who then become classified as "in-group" members, whereas individuals who are dissimilar become classified as "out-group" members. Race can be used as an example of in-group and out-group tendencies because society often categorizes individuals into groups based on race (Caucasian, African American, Latino, etc.). One study that examined race and [[empathy]] found that participants receiving nasally administered oxytocin had stronger reactions to pictures of in-group members making pained faces than to pictures of out-group members with the same expression.&lt;ref name="pmid23246533"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sheng F, Liu Y, Zhou B, Zhou W, Han S | title = Oxytocin modulates the racial bias in neural responses to others' suffering | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 92 | issue = 2 | pages = 380–6 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23246533 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2012.11.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that oxytocin may be implicated in our ability to empathize with individuals of different races and could potentially translate into willingness to help individuals in pain or stressful situations. Moreover, individuals of one race may be more inclined to help individuals of the same race than individuals of another race when they are experiencing pain. Oxytocin has also been implicated in [[Lie|lying]] when lying would prove beneficial to other in-group members. In a study where such a relationship was examined, it was found that when individuals were administered oxytocin, rates of [[dishonesty]] in the participants' responses increased for their in-group members when a beneficial outcome for their group was expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shalvi S, De Dreu CK | title = Oxytocin promotes group-serving dishonesty | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 15 | pages = 5503–7 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24706799 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1400724111 | pmc=3992689| bibcode = 2014PNAS..111.5503S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these examples show the tendency of individuals to act in ways that benefit those considered to be members of their social group, or in-group.

Oxytocin is not only correlated with the preferences of individuals to associate with members of their own group, but it is also evident during conflicts between members of different groups.  During conflict, individuals receiving nasally administered oxytocin demonstrate more frequent defense-motivated responses toward in-group members than out-group members. Further, oxytocin was correlated with participant desire to protect vulnerable in-group members, despite that individual's attachment to the conflict.&lt;ref name="pmid23144787"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = De Dreu CK, Shalvi S, Greer LL, Van Kleef GA, Handgraaf MJ | title = Oxytocin motivates non-cooperation in intergroup conflict to protect vulnerable in-group members | journal = PLOS One | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = e46751 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23144787 | pmc = 3492361 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0046751 | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...746751D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, it has been demonstrated that when oxytocin is administered, individuals alter their subjective preferences in order to align with in-group ideals over out-group ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stallen M, De Dreu CK, Shalvi S, Smidts A, Sanfey AG | title = The herding hormone: oxytocin stimulates in-group conformity | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 23 | issue = 11 | pages = 1288–92 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22991128 | doi = 10.1177/0956797612446026 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies demonstrate that oxytocin is associated with intergroup dynamics.  Further, oxytocin influences the responses of individuals in a particular group to those of another group. The in-group bias is evident in smaller groups; however, it can also be extended to groups as large as one's entire country leading toward a tendency of strong national zeal. A study done in the Netherlands showed that oxytocin increased the in-group favoritism of their nation while decreasing acceptance of members of other ethnicities and foreigners.&lt;ref name="pmid21220339"/&gt; People also show more affection for their country's flag while remaining indifferent to other cultural objects when exposed to oxytocin.&lt;ref name="pmid25140135"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ma X, Luo L, Geng Y, Zhao W, Zhang Q, Kendrick KM | title = Oxytocin increases liking for a country's people and national flag but not for other cultural symbols or consumer products | journal = Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | volume = 8 | issue =  | pages = 266 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25140135 | pmc = 4122242 | doi = 10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has thus been hypothesized that this hormone may be a factor in [[xenophobic]] tendencies secondary to this effect.  Thus, oxytocin appears to affect individuals at an international level where the in-group becomes a specific "home" country and the out-group grows to include all other countries.

====Drugs====
* [[Drug interaction]]: Impact on effects of alcohol and other drugs: According to several studies in animals, oxytocin inhibits the development of tolerance to various addictive drugs ([[opiate]]s, [[cocaine]], [[ethanol|alcohol]]), and reduces [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms.&lt;ref name="pmid9924746"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kovács GL, Sarnyai Z, Szabó G | title = Oxytocin and addiction: a review | journal = Psychoneuroendocrinology | volume = 23 | issue = 8 | pages = 945–62 | date = November 1998 | pmid = 9924746 | doi = 10.1016/S0306-4530(98)00064-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MDMA]] (ecstasy) may increase feelings of love, empathy, and connection to others by stimulating oxytocin activity primarily via activation of [[serotonin]] [[5-HT1A receptor]]s, if initial studies in animals apply to humans.&lt;ref name="pmid17383105"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson MR, Callaghan PD, Hunt GE, Cornish JL, McGregor IS | title = A role for oxytocin and 5-HT(1A) receptors in the prosocial effects of 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine ("ecstasy") | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 146 | issue = 2 | pages = 509–14 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17383105 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.02.032 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[anxiolytic]] [[Buspar]] (buspirone) may produce some of its effects via 5-HT1A receptor-induced oxytocin stimulation as well.&lt;ref name="pmid9025112"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uvnäs-Moberg K, Hillegaart V, Alster P, Ahlenius S | title = Effects of 5-HT agonists, selective for different receptor subtypes, on oxytocin, CCK, gastrin and somatostatin plasma levels in the rat | journal = Neuropharmacology | volume = 35 | issue = 11 | pages = 1635–40 | year = 1996 | pmid = 9025112 | doi = 10.1016/S0028-3908(96)00078-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8771561"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chiodera P, Volpi R, Capretti L, Caffarri G, Magotti MG, Coiro V | title = Different effects of the serotonergic agonists buspirone and sumatriptan on the posterior pituitary hormonal responses to hypoglycemia in humans | journal = Neuropeptides | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8771561 | doi = 10.1016/S0143-4179(96)90086-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Addiction vulnerability]]: Concentrations of endogenous oxytocin can impact the effects of various drugs and one's susceptibility to [[substance use disorder]]s. Additionally, bilateral interactions with numerous systems, including the [[dopamine]] system, [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis]] and [[immune system]], can impact development of dependence. The status of the endogenous oxytocin system might enhance or reduce susceptibility to addiction through its interaction with these systems. Individual differences in the endogenous oxytocin system based on genetic predisposition, gender and environmental influences, may therefore affect [[addiction vulnerability]].&lt;ref name="PBB"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buisman-Pijlman FT, Sumracki NM, Gordon JJ, Hull PR, Carter CS, Tops M | title = Individual differences underlying susceptibility to addiction: Role for the endogenous oxytocin system | journal = Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior | volume = 119 | pages = 22–38 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24056025 | doi = 10.1016/j.pbb.2013.09.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxytocin may be related to the [[Conditioned place preference|place conditioning behaviors]] observed in habitual drug abusers.

====Fear and anxiety====
Oxytocin is typically remembered for the effect it has on [[prosocial behavior]]s, such as its role in facilitating trust and attachment between individuals. Consequently, oxytocin is often referred to as the “love hormone".&lt;ref name="Grillon 958–960"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grillon C, Krimsky M, Charney DR, Vytal K, Ernst M, Cornwell B | title = Oxytocin increases anxiety to unpredictable threat | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 18 | issue = 9 | pages = 958–60 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23147382 | pmc = 3930442 | doi = 10.1038/mp.2012.156 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qualify evidence}} However, oxytocin has a more complex role than solely enhancing prosocial behaviors. There is consensus that oxytocin modulates [[fear]] and [[anxiety]]; that is, it does not directly elicit fear or anxiety.&lt;ref name="Guzmán 1185–1187"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guzmán YF, Tronson NC, Jovasevic V, Sato K, Guedea AL, Mizukami H, Nishimori K, Radulovic J | title = Fear-enhancing effects of septal oxytocin receptors | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 16 | issue = 9 | pages = 1185–7 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23872596 | pmc = 3758455 | doi = 10.1038/nn.3465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two dominant theories explain the role of oxytocin in fear and anxiety. One theory states that oxytocin increases approach/avoidance to certain social stimuli and the second theory states that oxytocin increases the salience of certain social stimuli, causing the animal or human to pay closer attention to socially relevant stimuli.&lt;ref name="Theodoridou e58113"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Theodoridou A, Penton-Voak IS, Rowe AC | title = A direct examination of the effect of intranasal administration of oxytocin on approach-avoidance motor responses to emotional stimuli | journal = PLOS One | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = e58113 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23469148 | pmc = 3585234 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0058113 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...858113T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasally administered oxytocin has been reported to reduce [[fear]], possibly by inhibiting the [[amygdala]] (which is thought to be responsible for fear responses).&lt;ref name="pmid16339042"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirsch P, Esslinger C, Chen Q, Mier D, Lis S, Siddhanti S, Gruppe H, Mattay VS, Gallhofer B, Meyer-Lindenberg A | title = Oxytocin modulates neural circuitry for social cognition and fear in humans | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 25 | issue = 49 | pages = 11489–93 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16339042 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3984-05.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, studies in rodents have shown oxytocin can efficiently inhibit fear responses by activating an inhibitory circuit within the amygdala.&lt;ref name="pmid15821089"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huber D, Veinante P, Stoop R | title = Vasopressin and oxytocin excite distinct neuronal populations in the central amygdala | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5719 | pages = 245–8 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15821089 | doi = 10.1126/SCIENCE.1105636 | bibcode = 2005Sci...308..245H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21719680"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Viviani D, Charlet A, van den Burg E, Robinet C, Hurni N, Abatis M, Magara F, Stoop R | title = Oxytocin selectively gates fear responses through distinct outputs from the central amygdala | journal = Science | volume = 333 | issue = 6038 | pages = 104–7 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21719680 | doi = 10.1126/SCIENCE.1201043 | bibcode = 2011Sci...333..104V }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have argued oxytocin has a general enhancing effect on all social emotions, since intranasal administration of oxytocin also increases [[envy]] and ''[[Schadenfreude]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shamay-Tsoory SG, Fischer M, Dvash J, Harari H, Perach-Bloom N, Levkovitz Y | title = Intranasal administration of oxytocin increases envy and schadenfreude (gloating) | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 66 | issue = 9 | pages = 864–70 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19640508 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.06.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who receive an intranasal dose of oxytocin identify facial expressions of disgust more quickly than individuals who do not receive oxytocin.&lt;ref name="Theodoridou e58113"/&gt;{{qualify evidence}} Facial expressions of disgust are evolutionarily linked to the idea of contagion. Thus, oxytocin increases the salience of cues that imply contamination, which leads to a faster response because these cues are especially relevant for survival. In another study, after administration of oxytocin, individuals displayed an enhanced ability to recognize expressions of fear compared to the individuals who received the placebo.&lt;ref name="pmid19747930"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fischer-Shofty M, Shamay-Tsoory SG, Harari H, Levkovitz Y | title = The effect of intranasal administration of oxytocin on fear recognition | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 179–84 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19747930 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxytocin modulates fear responses by enhancing the maintenance of social memories. Rats that are genetically modified to have a surplus of oxytocin receptors display a greater fear response to a previously conditioned stressor. Oxytocin enhances the aversive social memory, leading the rat to display a greater fear response when the aversive stimulus is encountered again.&lt;ref name="Guzmán 1185–1187"/&gt;

====Mood and depression====
Oxytocin produces [[antidepressant]]-like effects in [[animal model]]s of [[depression (mood)|depression]],&lt;ref name="MatsuzakiMatsushita2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matsuzaki M, Matsushita H, Tomizawa K, Matsui H | title = Oxytocin: a therapeutic target for mental disorders | journal = The Journal of Physiological Sciences | volume = 62 | issue = 6 | pages = 441–4 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23007624 | doi = 10.1007/s12576-012-0232-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a deficit of it may be involved in the [[pathophysiology]] of depression in humans.&lt;ref name="McQuaidMcInnis2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McQuaid RJ, McInnis OA, Abizaid A, Anisman H | title = Making room for oxytocin in understanding depression | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 45 | pages = 305–22 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25025656 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.07.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The antidepressant-like effects of oxytocin are not blocked by a selective antagonist of the oxytocin receptor, suggesting that these effects are not mediated by the oxytocin receptor.&lt;ref name="Acevedo-RodriguezMani2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Acevedo-Rodriguez A, Mani SK, Handa RJ | title = Oxytocin and Estrogen Receptor β in the Brain: An Overview | journal = Frontiers in Endocrinology | volume = 6 | pages = 160 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26528239 | pmc = 4606117 | doi = 10.3389/fendo.2015.00160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance, unlike oxytocin, the selective non-peptide oxytocin receptor agonist [[WAY-267,464]] does not produce antidepressant-like effects, at least in the [[tail suspension test]].&lt;ref name="ShalevEbstein2015"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Idan | last1 = Shalev | first2 = Richard Paul | last2 = Ebstein | name-list-format = vanc | title = Social Hormones and Human Behavior: What Do We Know and Where Do We Go from Here | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QbA9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51 | date = 11 February 2015 | publisher = Frontiers Media SA | isbn = 978-2-88919-407-0 | pages = 51–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to WAY-267,464, [[carbetocin]], a close [[structural analog|analogue]] of oxytocin and peptide oxytocin receptor agonist, notably does produce antidepressant-like effects in animals.&lt;ref name="ShalevEbstein2015" /&gt; As such, the antidepressant-like effects of oxytocin may be mediated by modulation of a different target, perhaps the [[arginine vasopressin receptor 1A|vasopressin V&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]] where oxytocin is known to weakly bind as an agonist.&lt;ref name="HicksRamos2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hicks C, Ramos L, Reekie T, Misagh GH, Narlawar R, Kassiou M, McGregor IS | title = Body temperature and cardiac changes induced by peripherally administered oxytocin, vasopressin and the non-peptide oxytocin receptor agonist WAY 267,464: a biotelemetry study in rats | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 171 | issue = 11 | pages = 2868–87 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24641248 | doi = 10.1111/bph.12613 | pmc=4243861}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ManningMisicka2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manning M, Misicka A, Olma A, Bankowski K, Stoev S, Chini B, Durroux T, Mouillac B, Corbani M, Guillon G | title = Oxytocin and vasopressin agonists and antagonists as research tools and potential therapeutics | journal = Journal of Neuroendocrinology | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 609–28 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22375852 | pmc = 3490377 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2826.2012.02303.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sex differences====
It has been shown that oxytocin differentially affects males and females. Females who are administered oxytocin are overall faster in responding to socially relevant stimuli than males who received oxytocin.&lt;ref name="Theodoridou e58113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lischke 1431–1438"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lischke A, Gamer M, Berger C, Grossmann A, Hauenstein K, Heinrichs M, Herpertz SC, Domes G | title = Oxytocin increases amygdala reactivity to threatening scenes in females | journal = Psychoneuroendocrinology | volume = 37 | issue = 9 | pages = 1431–8 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22365820 | doi = 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2012.01.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, after the administration of oxytocin, females show increased [[amygdala]] activity in response to threatening scenes; however, males do not show increased amygdala activation. This phenomenon can be explained by looking at the role of [[gonadal hormones]], specifically [[estrogen]], which modulate the enhanced threat processing seen in females. Estrogen has been shown to stimulate the release of oxytocin from the [[hypothalamus]] and promote receptor binding in the amygdala.&lt;ref name="Lischke 1431–1438"/&gt;

It has also been shown that testosterone directly suppresses oxytocin in mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Okabe S, Kitano K, Nagasawa M, Mogi K, Kikusui T | title = Testosterone inhibits facilitating effects of parenting experience on parental behavior and the oxytocin neural system in mice | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 118 | pages = 159–64 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23685236 | doi = 10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.05.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been hypothesized to have evolutionary significance. With oxytocin suppressed, activities such as hunting and attacking invaders would be less mentally difficult as oxytocin is strongly associated with empathy.&lt;ref name="pmid20371820"/&gt;

====Social====
* Affecting [[generosity]] by increasing empathy during perspective taking: In a [[neuroeconomics]] experiment, [[intranasal]] oxytocin increased generosity in the [[Ultimatum Game]] by 80%, but had no effect in the [[Dictator Game]] that measures altruism. Perspective-taking is not required in the Dictator Game, but the researchers in this experiment explicitly induced perspective-taking in the Ultimatum Game by not identifying to participants into which role they would be placed.&lt;ref name="pmid17987115"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zak PJ, Stanton AA, Ahmadi S | title = Oxytocin increases generosity in humans | journal = PLOS One | volume = 2 | issue = 11 | pages = e1128 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17987115 | pmc = 2040517 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0001128 | editor1-last = Brosnan | editor1-first = Sarah | bibcode = 2007PLoSO...2.1128Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Serious methodological questions have arisen, however, with regard to the role of oxytocin in trust and generosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Conlisk J |title=Professor Zak's empirical studies on trust and oxytocin |journal=J Econ Behav Organizat |volume=78 |issue=1–2 |pages=160–166 |year=2011|doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2011.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empathy in healthy males has been shown to be increased after intranasal oxytocin&lt;ref name="pmid20371820"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hurlemann R, Patin A, Onur OA, Cohen MX, Baumgartner T, Metzler S, Dziobek I, Gallinat J, Wagner M, Maier W, Kendrick KM | title = Oxytocin enhances amygdala-dependent, socially reinforced learning and emotional empathy in humans | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 30 | issue = 14 | pages = 4999–5007 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20371820 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5538-09.2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17137561"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Domes G, Heinrichs M, Michel A, Berger C, Herpertz SC | title = Oxytocin improves "mind-reading" in humans | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 61 | issue = 6 | pages = 731–3 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17137561 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.07.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is most likely due to the effect of oxytocin in enhancing eye gaze.&lt;ref name=" Guastellab2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guastella AJ, Mitchell PB, Dadds MR | title = Oxytocin increases gaze to the eye region of human faces | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 63 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–5 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17888410 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2007.06.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some discussion about which aspect of empathy oxytocin might alter – for example, cognitive vs. emotional empathy.&lt;ref name="pmid19102589"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Singer T, Snozzi R, Bird G, Petrovic P, Silani G, Heinrichs M, Dolan RJ | title = Effects of oxytocin and prosocial behavior on brain responses to direct and vicariously experienced pain | journal = Emotion | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 781–91 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19102589 | pmc = 2672051 | doi = 10.1037/a0014195 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While studying wild chimpanzees, it was noted that after a chimpanzee shared food with a non-kin related chimpanzee,  the subjects' levels of oxytocin increased, as measured through their urine.

While the structure of oxytocin is highly conserved in placental mammals, a novel structure of oxytocin was recently reported in [[marmoset]]s, [[tamarin]]s, and other new world [[primates]]. Genomic sequencing of the gene for oxytocin revealed a single [[In-frame mutation#in-frame|in-frame mutation]] ([[thymine]] for [[cytosine]]) which results in a single amino acid substitution at the 8-position ([[proline]] for [[leucine]]).&lt;ref name= "pmid21411453"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee AG, Cool DR, Grunwald WC, Neal DE, Buckmaster CL, Cheng MY, Hyde SA, Lyons DM, Parker KJ | title = A novel form of oxytocin in New World monkeys | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 584–7 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21411453 | pmc = 3130245 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2011.0107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this original Lee ''et al.'' paper, two other laboratories have confirmed Pro8-OT and documented additional oxytocin structural variants in this primate taxon.

The biologically active form of oxytocin, commonly measured by [[Radioimmunoassay|RIA]] and/or [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] techniques, is also known as the octapeptide "oxytocin disulfide" (oxidized form), but oxytocin also exists as a reduced straight-chain (non-cyclic) [[dithiol]] nonapeptide called oxytoceine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1960.tb20052.x |title=Experiences in the Polypeptide Field: Insulin to Oxytocin |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=537–48 |year=2006 |last1=Vigneaud |first1=Vincent | name-list-format = vanc | bibcode = 1960NYASA..88..537V }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been theorized that oxytoceine may act as a [[free radical]] scavenger, as donating an electron to a free radical allows oxytoceine to be re-oxidized to oxytocin via the [[dehydroascorbate]] / [[ascorbate]] redox couple.&lt;ref name="DLA: Mechanisms by which hypoxia augments Leydig cell viability and differentiated cell function in vitro"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-06062008-170416 | title=Mechanisms by which hypoxia augments Leydig cell viability and differentiated cell function in vitro | author = Kukucka MA | date=1993-04-18 | publisher=Digital Library and Archives | accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of oxytocin is very similar to that of [[vasopressin]].

Oxytocin and vasopressin are the only known hormones released by the human [[posterior pituitary gland]] to act at a distance. However, oxytocin neurons make other peptides, including [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] and [[dynorphin]], for example, that act locally. The [[magnocellular neurosecretory cell]]s that make oxytocin are adjacent to magnocellular neurosecretory cells that make vasopressin. These are large neuroendocrine neurons which are excitable and can generate action potentials.&lt;ref name="pmid10221785"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leng G, Brown CH, Russell JA | title = Physiological pathways regulating the activity of magnocellular neurosecretory cells | journal = Progress in Neurobiology | volume = 57 | issue = 6 | pages = 625–55 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10221785 | doi = 10.1016/s0301-0082(98)00072-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''oxytocin'' was coined from the term ''oxytocic'', [[Greek language|Greek]] ὀξύς, ''oxys'', and τοκετός , ''toketos'', meaning "quick birth".

'''Patrick Russell''' (6 February 1726, [[Edinburgh]] – 2 July 1805, London) was a Scottish surgeon and naturalist who worked in [[India]]. He studied the [[snakes]] of India and is considered the "Father of Indian [[Ophiology]]". Russell's viper, ''[[Daboia|Daboia russelii]]'', is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). ''The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-4214-0135-5}}. ("Russell, P.", pp. 229-230).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
The fifth son of John Russell, a well-known lawyer of Edinburgh, and his third wife Mary, Patrick was the half-brother of [[Alexander Russell (naturalist)|Alexander Russell]], FRS and William Russell, FRS. Patrick studied Roman and Greek classics at Edinburgh high school after which he studied medicine at the University under Alexander Monro. He graduated as a Doctor of Medicine in 1750 and joined his half-brother, Alexander Russell, who was 12 years senior in [[Aleppo]], Syria. In 1740 Alexader had been made a Physician to the Levant Company's Factory. Alexander was involved in quarantine and disease control and was a keen naturalist with a knowledge of local languages and a close friend of the Pasha.
&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7886689|year=1994|last1=Hawgood|first1=BJ|title=The life and viper of Dr Patrick Russell MD FRS (1727–1805): Physician and naturalist|volume=32|issue=11|pages=1295–304|journal=Toxicon|doi=10.1016/0041-0101(94)90402-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aleppo==
In 1753, Alexander resigned, returning to London and publishing a ''Natural History of Aleppo and Parts Adjacent'' in 1756. Patrick took up the position left by Alexander and worked for about 18 years. The Pasha of Aleppo held him in high regard, even honouring him with a turban. A keen observer of traditions, he noted in a letter read by Alexander to the Royal Society an Arabian practice of inoculating children against smallpox using "variolus matter". Several outbreaks of [[bubonic plague]] occurred in Aleppo in 1760, 1761 and 1762. He studied the conditions of those who were infected and identified procedures to avoid infection such as breathing through a handkerchief soaked in vinegar. He continued to maintain notes on natural history and after Alexander died in 1768, he revised the ''Natural History of Aleppo'' in 1794. He noticed that fleas tended to reduce in numbers after the hottest weather, a climate he noticed also led to a decline in the number of plague cases.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

==Return to England==
In 1771 he left Aleppo and travelled through Italy, examining the methods used to reduce the spread of diseases. Initially intending to set up practice in Edinburgh, he was persuaded by Dr [[John Fothergill (physician)|John Fothergill]], to move instead to London. Dr Fothergill was a friend of Alexander, an eminent physician and the founder of a botanical garden. While in London, Patrick was introduced to Sir [[Joseph Banks]] and [[Daniel Solander]] who examined his collections from Aleppo. In 1777, Patrick was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

==India==
[[Image:Russell Patrick 1726-1805.jpg|thumb|left|Patrick Russell with Turban in Aleppo, c. 1770.&lt;!-- Engraved by William Ridley (if true, must have been at a later date, Ridley was born in 1764)--&gt;]]

In 1781, a younger brother, Claud became a chief administrator of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] at [[Visakhapatnam]] in [[Madras Province]]. Claud however suffered poor health and the family insisted that Patrick attend to him. Arriving in India, he began to study the natural history of the region. The naturalist to the East India Company in the Carnatic was Dr John Koenig, student of Carolus Linnaeus and when he died in 1785, the Governor of Madras personally offered the post of 'Botanist and Naturalist' to Patrick. This post, according to Ray Desmond (1992, ''European Discovery of Indian Flora'') was:
: ''The Company's expectations of their Naturalist were excessively optimistic. He was presumed to be a linguist, demographer, antiquarian, meteorologist, mineralogist and zoologist (in addition to being a botanist).''

[[File:Cobra_hood_structure1.jpg|thumb|Structure of the cobra hood. [[William Clift]], 1804]]

Russell wrote about the plant and animal life of Madras as he had of Aleppo. As a physician as well as a naturalist to the East India Company in the [[Carnatic region|Carnatic]] he was concerned with the problem of [[snakebite]] and made it his aim to find a way for people to identify [[venomous snakes]]. He also made a large collection of plants. One of the snakes he identified was ''Katuka Rekula Poda'' which he noted was not well known to Europeans but was second only to the cobra in its lethality. Russell attempted to classify the snakes using the nature of scales but his quest was to find an easy way to separate the venomous snakes from the non-venomous. He conducted envenomation experiments on dogs and chicken and described the symptoms. He tested remedies claimed for snakebite including a pill from Tanjore which was very popular and found that it did not work. In one case a soldier in torpor was brought to him and the common treatment used by Europeans was tested. Two bottles of warm Madeira wine was forcibly poured into the patient's mouth, who then completely recovered. Patrick, his brother Claud and the family left for England in January 1791. Some of the collections he made were placed in the museum at Madras although he took back some snake skins that are now in the collection of the Natural History Museum at London. Returning to England, he worked on the book on snakes, which was to be published by the East India Company. The first volume of his ''An Account of Indian Serpents Collected on the Coast of Coromandel'' was published in 1796 with 44 plates. The second volume appeared in four parts, the first two of which were published in 1801 and 1802. These included 46 coloured plates. Patrick Russell died on 2 July 1805, three days after an illness. He was never married. The third and fourth parts of the second volume of his book was published after his death in 1807 and 1809. Two scientific papers were read on the pits of the pit viper ''Trimeresurus'' which he demonstrated as not being associated with hearing. Another paper demonstrated the voluntary mechanism by which the cobra spread its hood.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

'''''País do Desejo''''' is a 2012 Brazilian-Portuguese [[Drama film|drama]] film directed by Paulo Caldas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancine.gov.br/brasil-nas-telas/pa-s-do-desejo País do desejo | Brasil nas Telas | ANCINE | Agência Nacional do Cinema | Ministério da Cultura | Governo Federal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;	
The film premiered at the [[São Paulo International Film Festival|35th São Paulo International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.telabr.com.br/noticias/2013/01/25/pais-do-desejo-chega-as-telonas/ Tela Brasil – O portal de formação e informação sobre o universo audiovisual » Blog Archive » País do Desejo chega às telonas&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is based in the case of a girl from [[Alagoinha]], in [[Pernambuco]]. In 2009, the girl became pregnant after years of sexual abuse committed by the stepfather. As the pregnancy was the result of a rape and represented a risk to the life of the girl, she did an abortion, as is provided for in the Brazilian legislation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.pco.org.br/conoticias/imprimir_materia.php?mat=34821 Mulheres - Estréia em Portugal filme brasileiro sobre o caso de Alagoinha - 26/01/2012&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The story is told from the center of the crisis of a Catholic priest that is positioned against the decision of the Archbishop of the Church to excommunicate the mother, the girl and the doctors involved in the abortion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

== Plot ==
The film tells the story of Roberta, a famous classical pianist who faces a tough battle against a severe kidney disease, and José, a somewhat unconventional priest, which supports a 12-year-old girl raped by her uncle and pregnant with twins, to have an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinema10.com.br/filme/pais-do-desejo País do Desejo - Filme 2012 - Cinema10.com.br&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fate of the two characters crosses when Roberta faints at a concert and is hospitalized in a local clinic, belonging to the brother of the priest. Gradually, he is interested by the pianist, and that love will change their destiny in many ways.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Abuja Breast Cancer Support Group==
Project PINK BLUE chose the occasion of [http://www.worldcancerday.org World Cancer Day] to launch the Abuja Breast Cancer Support Group - the city's first patient support group. The milestone achievement was commemorated with a medal-giving ceremony for breast cancer survivors attended by leaders from the cancer control community as well as His Royal Majesty
Dr. Kabiru Musa, the Emir of Azara .

==Upgrade Oncology==
Project PINK BLUE launched the Upgrade Oncology programme during the 2018 World Cancer Day activities [http://www.worldcancerday.org]. The Upgrade Oncology is a capacity development program focused on improving cancer treatment and care through the provision of medical oncology training, update/top-up trainings, development of medical oncology curriculum, review and domestication of the treatment guidelines for better cancer care in Nigeria.

==Advocacy==
Project PINK BLUE also used the Day to call on the Federal government to set up a national agency for cancer control, urging decision- makers to make cancer control a national health priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Business|url=https://www.businessdayonline.com/ngo-seeks-establishment-national-cancer-control-agency/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and medical uses --&gt;
'''Rh&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;(D) immune globulin''' ('''RhIG''') is a medication used to prevent [[Rh isoimmunization]] in mothers who are [[Rh negative]] and to treat [[idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]] (ITP) in people who are [[Rh positive]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2017/&gt; It is often given both during and following [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2017/&gt; It may also be used when Rh negative people are given Rh positive blood.&lt;ref name=AHFS2017/&gt; It is given by [[intramuscular injection|injection into muscle]] or a [[intravenous|vein]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2017/&gt; A single dose lasts 2 to 4 weeks.&lt;ref name="AHFS2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/rho-d-immune-globulin.html|title=Rho(D) Immune Globulin|last=|first=|date=|website=Drugs.com|publisher=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109021739/https://www.drugs.com/monograph/rho-d-immune-globulin.html|archivedate=9 January 2017|deadurl=no|accessdate=8 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Side effects and mechanism --&gt;
Common side effects include [[fever]], headache, pain at the site of injection, and [[hemolysis|red blood cell breakdown]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2017/&gt; Other side effects include [[allergic reactions]], [[kidney problems]], and a very small risk of viral infections.&lt;ref name=AHFS2017/&gt; In those with ITP, the amount of red blood cell breakdown may be significant.&lt;ref name=AHFS2017/&gt; Use is safe with [[breastfeeding]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2017/&gt; Rho(D) immune globulin is made up of [[antibodies]] to the [[antigen]] Rh&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;(D) present on some [[red blood cells]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2017/&gt; It is believed to work by blocking a person's immune system from recognizing this antigen.&lt;ref name=AHFS2017/&gt;

==Medical uses==
In a pregnancy where the mother is Rho(D)-negative and the father is Rho(D)-positive, the probability of the fetus having Rho(D)-positive blood is dependent on whether the father is [[homozygous]] for Rho(D)-positive (i.e., both Rho(D) alleles are positive) or [[heterozygous]] (i.e., one Rho(D) allele is positive and the other negative). If the father is homozygous, the fetus will necessarily be Rho(D)-positive, as the father will necessarily pass on a Rho(D)-positive allele. If the father is heterozygous, there is a 50% chance that the fetus will be Rho(D)-positive, as he will randomly pass on either the Rho(D)-positive allele or the Rho(D)-negative allele.

If a fetus is Rho(D)-positive and the mother is Rho(D)-negative, the mother is at risk of Rho(D) alloimmunization, where the mother mounts an immune response (develops [[antibodies]]) to fetal red blood cells. This usually has minimal effect on the first such pregnancy; but, in a second such pregnancy, pre-existing maternal antibodies to Rho(D) antigens on fetal red blood cells often leads to [[erythroblastosis fetalis]], a condition which can be fatal to the fetus. In countries without RhIG protocols, as many as 14% of affected fetuses are stillborn and 50% of live births result in neonatal death or brain injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Practice Bulletin No. 181: Prevention of Rh D Alloimmunization. |journal = [[American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology]] |date = August 2017 |pmid=28742673 |doi=10.1097/AOG.0000000000002232 |volume=130 |pages=e57-e70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this severe complication, the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG) recommends that all Rho(D)-negative mothers, regardless of fetal blood type, receive RhIG at about 28 weeks gestation, and again shortly after delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/TA41/?c=91520 |title = Pregnancy - routine anti-D prophylaxis for RhD-negative women |publisher = [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] |date = May 2002 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080828175059/http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/TA41/?c=91520 |archivedate = 2008-08-28 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be given within 3 days of a potential exposure to Rh positive blood from the baby such as may occur during miscarriage, trauma, or delivery.&lt;ref name=BNF69/&gt; The '28 weeks' recommendation comes from the fact that 92% of women who develop an anti-D during pregnancy do so at or after 28 weeks gestation.&lt;ref name="Roback 2008"&gt;Roback et al. AABB Technical Manual, 16th Ed. Bethesda, AABB Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowman JM 1988 129–50"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bowman JM | year = 1988 | title = The Prevention of Rh Immunization | url = | journal = Transfus Med Rev | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 129–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="D Alloimmunization. ACOG Practice Bulletin Number 4 1999"&gt;Prevention of Rh D Alloimmunization. ACOG Practice Bulletin Number 4. Washington, DC: American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; It is given by intramuscular injection as part of modern routine [[antenatal]] care. Despite excellent results, the medication retains an FDA [[Pregnancy category|Pregnancy Category]] C.

RhIG is recommended in the UK after antenatal pathological events that are likely to cause a feto–maternal hemorrhage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.rcog.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=1972 |title = Use of Anti-D Immunoglobulin for Rh Prophylaxis |publisher = [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] |date = May 2002 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081230200349/http://www.rcog.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=1972 |archivedate = 2008-12-30 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Applicable 'pathologic events' include accidents which may induce fetomaternal hemorrhage (motor vehicle accidents, falls, abdominal trauma), following obstetric/gynecologic procedures during pregnancy, and at the time of threatened- or spontaneous-/elective [[abortion]]s, regardless of gestational age.

There is insufficient evidence that the use of Rho(D) immune globulin after a spontaneous miscarriage is needed and a [[Cochrane review]] recommends that local practices be followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karanth|first1=L|last2=Jaafar|first2=SH|last3=Kanagasabai|first3=S|last4=Nair|first4=NS|last5=Barua|first5=A|title=Anti-D administration after spontaneous miscarriage for preventing Rhesus alloimmunisation.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Mar 28, 2013|volume=3|pages=CD009617|pmid=23543581|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009617.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Rhesus-negative mother, Rh&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;(D) immune globulin can prevent temporary sensitization of the maternal immune system to Rh D [[antigen]]s, which can cause rhesus disease in the current or in subsequent pregnancies. With the widespread use of Rho(D) immune globulin, [[Rh disease]] of the [[fetus]] and [[newborn]] has almost disappeared in the developed world. The risk that a D-negative mother can be [[Alloimmunity|alloimmunized]] by a D-positive fetus can be reduced from approximately 16% to less than 0.1% by the appropriate administration of RhIG.&lt;ref name="Roback 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowman JM 1988 129–50"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bowman JM | year = 1985 | title = Controversies in Rh Prophylaxis. Who Needs Rh Immune Globulin and When Should it be Given? | url = | journal = Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 151 | issue = | pages = 289–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rho(D) immune globulin is composed of IgG antibodies and therefore is able to cross the placenta. In rare cases this can cause a baby to have a weakly positive [[Direct antiglobulin test|DAT]] ([[direct antiglobulin test]]) due to sensitization of fetal cells from mothers who have received multiple doses of Rho(D) immune globulin. However, no treatment is necessary as the clinical course is benign.&lt;ref&gt;Rudmann, Sally V. 2005. "Textbook of Blood Banking and Transfusion Medicine 2nd Edition." ELSEVIER Saunders. pp 439-441&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Following delivery ===
A D-negative mother who is not alloimmunized to D should also receive an appropriate dose of RhIG after delivery of a D-positive infant. After delivery, a cord blood sample from infants born to D-negative mothers should be tested for the D antigen.  If the neonate is D-negative, no further RhIG is needed.  However, if the infant is D-positive, the mother should have a postpartum blood sample screened for fetomaternal hemorrhage in order to determine the appropriate dosage of RhIG to be administered.  (the presence of residual anti-D from antepartum RhIG administration does NOT indicate ongoing protection from alloimmunization- repeat administration of RhIG is necessary).

The [[rosette test]] is a sensitive method to detect fetomaternal hemorrhage of 10 cc or more.  A rosette test will be positive if fetal D-positive cells are present in the maternal sample, indicating a significantly large fetomaternal hemorrhage has occurred.  A rosette test may be falsely positive if the mother is positive for the [[weak D]] phenotype and falsely negative if the neonate is weak D.  If the rosette test is negative, then a dose of 300 micrograms of RhIG is given (sufficient to prevent alloimmunization after delivery in 99% of cases).&lt;ref name="Roback 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klein Hg and Anstee DJ. Haemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn. In: Mollison's Blood Transfusion in Clinical Medicine.  11th Ed. Oxford: Blackwell, 2005: 496-545.&lt;/ref&gt;  The RhIG dose suppresses the immune response to up to 30 cc of whole fetal blood.

If a fetomaternal hemorrhage in excess of 30 cc has occurred, additional testing is mandatory in order to determine the appropriate dosage of RhIG to prevent alloimmunization.  A positive rosette test should be followed by a quantitative test such as the [[Kleihauer-Betke test]] (acid/elution) or an alternative approach such as [[flow cytometry]].  See article on [[Kleihauer-Betke test]] for details on how the volume of fetomaternal hemorrhage is calculated.

The dosage of RhIG is calculated from the volume of fetal hemorrhage (in mL).  Ex: 50 mL fetal hemorrhage / 30 ml = 1.667 (round up to 2) then add 1 = 3 vials of RhIG.

Postpartum RhIG should be administered within 72 hours of delivery.  If prophylaxis is delayed, the likelihood that alloimmunization will be prevented is decreased.  However, ACOG still recommends that RhIG be administered because partial protection still occurs.&lt;ref name="Roback 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="D Alloimmunization.

Primary [[immune thrombocytopenia]] (ITP) is an acquired immune-mediated disorder characterized by isolated [[thrombocytopenia]], defined as a peripheral blood platelet count less than 100 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/L, and the absence of any obvious initiating and/or underlying cause of the thrombocytopenia.  Symptoms of ITP include abnormal bleeding and bruising due to the reduction in [[platelet count]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Provan D, Stasi R, Newland AC, etal | year = 2010 | title = International consensus report on the investigation and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia | url = http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/115/2/168.full.pdf+html | journal = Blood | volume = 115 | issue = 2 | pages = 168–186 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2009-06-225565 | pmid = 19846889 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200615/http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/115/2/168.full.pdf+html | archivedate = 2013-10-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rh&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;(D) Immune Globulin Intravenous [Human; Anti-D] is indicated for use in non-splenectomized, Rh&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;(D)-positive children with chronic or acute ITP, adults with chronic ITP, and children and adults with ITP secondary to HIV infection. Anti-D must be administered via the intravenous route when used in clinical situations requiring an increase in platelet count. The mechanism of action of anti-D is not fully understood; however, after administration the anti-D coated red blood cell complexes saturate [[Fc receptor|Fcγ receptors]] sites on [[macrophages]], resulting in preferential destruction of [[red blood cells]] (RBCs), therefore sparing antibody-coated [[platelets]].&lt;ref&gt;Winrho SDF current prescribing information.

== Contraindications ==
The following females are not candidates for RhIG:
* D-negative females whose fetus is known to be D-negative
* D-negative females who have been previously alloimmunized to D (they have an anti-D antibody)
* Any D-positive females (women who test positive for the [[weak D]] phenotype should be considered D-positive and not receive RhIG).

==History==
The first Rho(D) immune globulin treatment "skymed" was introduced by Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, a subsidiary holding of [[Jskymed]], and was first administered on May 29, 1968 to Marianne Cummins in Teaneck, NJ.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.vaxserve.com/views/PDF/RhoGAM%20Ultra-Filtered%20Plus%20Package%20Insert%207-07.pdf RhoGAM product label, includes clinical trial data and prescribing information]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 ZLB Bioplasma (part of [[CSL Behring]]) was given approval to sell Rhophylac in Europe. Effectiveness was demonstrated in a clinical trial in 2003 and in 2004 Rhophylac was approved in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhophylac.com/AboutHDN/evolution.asp History of HDN Treatment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121040322/http://www.rhophylac.com/AboutHDN/evolution.asp |date=2008-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
===Manufacturing and safety===
Rho(D) immune globulin is a derivative of human [[Blood plasma|plasma]]. The most common way anti-D products are manufactured is by a form of the [[Cohn process|Cohn cold ethanol fractionation method]] developed in the 1950s.  Variations of the Cohn method developed in the 1950s may not completely clear aggregates of immunoglobulins, which can cause problems for patients if administered intravenously, and is a primary reason why most anti-Ds are for intramuscular use only.  A non-Cohn manufacturing variation is ChromaPlus process approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) that is used to make Rhophylac.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhophylac.com/About/chromaplus.asp ChromaPlus Manufacturing Process] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121035457/http://www.rhophylac.com/About/chromaplus.asp |date=2008-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rho(D) immune globulin may trigger an allergic reaction. Steps are taken in the plasma-donor screening process and the manufacturing process to eliminate bacterial and viral contamination, although a small, residual risk may remain for contamination with small viruses. There is also a theoretical possibility of transmission of the [[prion]] responsible for [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]], or of other, unknown infectious agents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jnj.com/innovations/new_features/RhoGAM.htm RhoGAM Ultra-Filtered PLUS Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human) Information Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060311120204/http://www.jnj.com/innovations/new_features/RhoGAM.htm |date=2006-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Routes of administration ===
RhIG can be administered either by either intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) injection, depending on the preparation.  The IM-only preparation should never be administered IV due to the risk of complement system activation.  Multiple IM doses should be given at different sites or at different times within the 72-hour window.  Or, multiple IV doses can be administered according to the instructions in the package insert.

===Names===
Rh&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;(D) immune globulin is also spelled Rh&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(D) immune globulin (letter [[o]] and digit [[zero]] are both widely attested; more at [[Rh blood group system#Rh nomenclature|Rh blood group system - Rh nomenclature]]).

Rhophylac is manufactured by CSL Limited. RhoGAM and MICRhoGam are brand names of Kedrion Biopharma. Other brand names are BayRHo-D, Gamulin Rh, HypRho-D Mini-Dose, Mini-Gamulin Rh, Partobulin SDF ([[Baxter International|Baxter]]), Rhesonativ (Octapharma), and RhesuGam (NBI).  KamRho-D I.M. is a brand name of Kamada Ltd.

The United States [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] rights for WinRho SDF (another brand name) were transferred from Baxter to the manufacturer, [[Cangene]], in 2010; they had been held by Baxter since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | title=Cangene assumes U.S. commercialization rights for WinRho SDF | date=5 May 2010 | work=[[Biotech Week]] | location=United States | via=[[HighBeam Research]] | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-225162858.html | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329105804/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-225162858.html | archivedate=29 March 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sales of WinRho fell every year under the agreement with Baxter, the supposition being that Baxter was favoring the sale of its own product over WinRho; according to one analyst, "WinRho was always an afterthought for a big company like Baxter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Cash, Martin | work=[[Winnipeg Free Press]] | title=Cangene Corp. begins transformation project | date=16 June 2010 | via=[[HighBeam Research]] | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2058879031.html | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329105801/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2058879031.html | archivedate=29 March 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It began as a [[civil action]], a handwritten petition filed against the [[Texas Department of Corrections]] (TDC) in 1972 by inmate '''David Resendez Ruíz''' alleging that the conditions of his incarceration, such as overcrowding, lack of access to health care, and abusive security practices, were a violation of his [[constitutional rights]].&lt;ref name="reynolds1"/&gt;  In 1974, the petition was joined by seven other inmates and became a [[class action suit]] known as ''Ruiz v. Estelle'', 550 F.2d 238. The trial ended in 1979 with the ruling that the conditions of imprisonment within the TDC prison system constituted [[cruel and unusual punishment]] in violation of the [[United States Constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;

==David Resendez Ruíz==
David Resendez Ruíz was a [[Mexican-American]] from East [[Austin, Texas]].&lt;ref name="Perkinson253"&gt;Perkinson, Robert. ''[[Texas Tough: The Rise of America's Prison Empire]]''. First Edition. [[Metropolitan Books]], 2010. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HOxmcfIopugC&amp;pg=PA253 253]. {{ISBN|978-0-8050-8069-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perkinson257"&gt;Perkinson, Robert. ''[[Texas Tough: The Rise of America's Prison Empire]]''. First Edition. [[Metropolitan Books]], 2010. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HOxmcfIopugC&amp;pg=PA257 257]. {{ISBN|978-0-8050-8069-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The son of migrant farmworkers and the youngest of 13 children, he got into trouble with the law from an early age; as a child he was arrested for fighting and shoplifting. After an arrest for a car theft, 12-year-old Ruíz received a sentence to serve time in [[Gatesville State School]] in [[Gatesville, Texas|Gatesville]]; he arrived for his first session in 1954.&lt;ref name="Perkinson253"/&gt; In Gatesville he socialized with "hard core"&lt;!--Quote is from book--&gt; state school students from Austin and [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]]. Ruíz had four sessions in Gatesville. After Ruíz left Gatesville for the final time, he turned 17, which made him an adult in the Texas penal system.&lt;ref name="Perkinson254"&gt;Perkinson, Robert. ''[[Texas Tough: The Rise of America's Prison Empire]]''. First Edition. [[Metropolitan Books]], 2010. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HOxmcfIopugC&amp;pg=PA254 254]. {{ISBN|978-0-8050-8069-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After another car theft, he was sentenced to serve time in the [[Texas Department of Corrections]] (TDC). He initially was placed in [[Huntsville, Texas|Huntsville]]; two weeks later he was assigned to the [[Ramsey Unit|Ramsey Farm]] in [[Brazoria County, Texas]], where he worked in fields. In Ramsey, Ruíz attempted to kill an inmate that he believed was planning to have Ruíz killed;&lt;ref name="Perkinson254"/&gt; the stabbing injured but did not kill the prisoner. The prison authorities beat Ruíz as a punishment. During his confinement in Ramsey, Ruíz had also committed lesser infractions. His first adult sentence lasted seven years. After he left prison, Ruíz married a woman named Rose Marie and the two had a daughter together.&lt;ref name="Perkinson255"&gt;Perkinson, Robert. ''[[Texas Tough: The Rise of America's Prison Empire]]''. First Edition. [[Metropolitan Books]], 2010. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HOxmcfIopugC&amp;pg=PA255 255]. {{ISBN|978-0-8050-8069-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirteen months after his release, on July 1968, Ruíz was again placed in the custody of the TDC; he said that he had "picked up the gun" because he had no education or trade skills to support himself and his family. He was then assigned to the [[Eastham Unit]] in [[Houston County, Texas|Houston County]], where he continued to work in fields. While at Eastham, Ruíz participated in a failed escape attempt.&lt;ref name="Perkinson255"/&gt; The warden of Eastham and [[George Beto]], the TDC director, escorted Ruíz back to prison. 

After a week in the infirmary, Ruíz was placed in solitary confinement for 45 days; there he decided to become a prison activist.&lt;ref name="Perkinson256"&gt;Perkinson, Robert. ''[[Texas Tough: The Rise of America's Prison Empire]]''. First Edition. [[Metropolitan Books]], 2010. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HOxmcfIopugC&amp;pg=PA256 256]. {{ISBN|978-0-8050-8069-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After Ruíz left solitary confinement, he refused to work in the fields any longer and cut his achilles tendon with a razor. Because of the self-inflicted injuries, Ruíz was no longer required to work, and he was sent to various correctional and medical facilities.&lt;ref name="Perkinson257"/&gt; Ruíz had committed many disciplinary infractions, including the stabbing, the escape attempt, and the refusal to work, so he was sent to the [[Wynne Unit]], where he met Fred Cruz, a prisoner who filed successful lawsuits against the prison system. At the Wynne Unit, Ruíz, Cruz, and other prisoners worked together to file lawsuits against TDC.&lt;ref name="Perkinson260"&gt;Perkinson, Robert. ''[[Texas Tough: The Rise of America's Prison Empire]]''. First Edition. [[Metropolitan Books]], 2010. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HOxmcfIopugC&amp;pg=PA260 260]. {{ISBN|978-0-8050-8069-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent litigation==
There followed decades of further litigation in the form of [[consent decree]]s, [[appeal]]s and other legal actions, until a final judgment was rendered in 1992.&lt;ref name="reynolds1"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  But problems in enforcement continued, and in 1996 [[U.S. Congress]] enacted the [[Prison Litigation Reform Act]] (PLRA) to address these issues as well as abuse of the prison litigation process.&lt;ref name="reynolds2"&gt;

However, in October 1997, the district court, still not satisfied with the compliance of the TDC, gave permission for continuing site visits by attorneys and experts for the inmate class, and this continued into 1999. In response to this, the TDC issued more than 450,000 pages of evidence and accepted 50 additional site visits.&lt;ref name="reynolds2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reynolds4"&gt;

|last=Reynolds
|first=Carl
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the court found that the TDC was in compliance on the issue of [[use of force]] against inmates and had adequate policies and procedures in place. However, the court continued to have issues with the "current and ongoing constitutional violations regarding administrative segregation [in] the conditions of confinement and the practice of using administrative segregation to house [[mentally ill]] inmates" that it found.&lt;ref name="reynolds2"/&gt;

In 2007, in the consolidated case of ''[[Jones v. Bock]]'' the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], in a unanimous decision,  set forth limitations on the extent of prison litigation.&lt;ref&gt;

The eating of wood, whether live or dead, is known as [[xylophagy]]. Τhe activity of animals feeding only on dead wood is called sapro-xylophagy and those animals, sapro-xylophagous.

==Ecology==

In [[food webs]], saprophages generally play the roles of [[decomposers]]. There are two main branches of saprophges, broken down by nutrient source. There are [[necrophage]]s which consume dead animal biomass, and [[thanatophage]]s which consume dead plant biomass.

[[File:Rue Ville l'Eveque, 16.jpg|thumb|Suez head office, 16 rue de la Ville-L'Évêque, Paris 8th arr.]]
'''Suez S.A.''' was a leading [[France|French]]-based [[multinational corporation]] headquartered in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris|8th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20021230150209/http://www.suez.com/mention-uk.htm Disclaimer]." Suez. Retrieved on 7 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; with operations primarily in [[water]], [[electricity]] and [[natural gas]] supply, and [[waste management]]. Suez was result of a 1997 merger between the ''[[Compagnie de Suez]]'' and ''[[:fr:Lyonnaise des Eaux|Lyonnaise des Eaux]]'', a leading French water company. In the early 2000s Suez also owned some [[mass media|media]] and [[telecommunication]]s assets, but has since [[divestment|divested]] these. According to the ''Masons Water Yearbook'' 2004/5, Suez served 117.4 million people around the world. The company conducted a merger of equals with fellow [[public utility|utility]] company [[Gaz de France]] on 22 July 2008 to form [[GDF Suez]]&lt;ref name="Bloom"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=aFiKMd_hki.Q&amp;refer=europe|title=GDF Suez Shares Fall in Debut Following Merger |last=Patel|first=Tara|date=22 July 2008|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (called [[Engie]] since 2015). The water and waste assets of Suez were [[Corporate spin-off|spun off]] into a separate publicly traded company, [[Suez Environnement]].&lt;ref name="Bloom" /&gt;

==History==
Suez was (and remains, through GDF Suez) one of the oldest continuously existing multinational corporations in the world, with one line of corporate history dating back to the 1822 founding of the {{lang|nl|Algemeene Nederlandsche Maatschappij ter begunstiging van de volksvlijt}} (literally: General Dutch Company for the favouring of industry) by King [[William I of the Netherlands]] (see [[Société Générale de Belgique]]). Its form prior to the GDF merger was the result of nearly two centuries of reorganisation and corporate mergers.  Its most recent name comes from the involvement of one of its several founding entities – the ''[[Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez]]'' – in building the [[Suez Canal]] in the mid-19th century.

===Merger with Gaz de France===
On February 25, 2006, French Prime minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] announced the merger of Suez and [[Gaz de France]], which would make the world's largest [[liquefied natural gas]] company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3234,36-745348,0.html (subscription)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[revenue]] of GDF was around 22.4 billion euros in 2005, compared to 41.5 billion for Suez. The [[Confédération Générale du Travail|CGT trade-union]] called the merger a  "disguised privatization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanite.fr/journal/2006-02-28/2006-02-28-825123 |title=GDF-Suez petits arrangements avec la vérité |publisher=humanite.fr |accessdate=2006-09-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624065945/http://www.humanite.fr/journal/2006-02-28/2006-02-28-825123 |archivedate=2006-06-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September 2007, Gaz de France and Suez announced agreed terms of merger. The deal was conducted on the basis of an exchange of 21 Gaz de France shares for 22 Suez shares via the absorption of Suez by Gaz de France. The French state holds more than 35% of shares of the merged company, GDF Suez.&lt;ref name=rtt&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.rttnews.com/sp/todaystop.asp?item=3 | title=Suez, Gaz De France Agree To New Merger Deal | publisher=RTT News | date=2007-09-04 | accessdate=2007-09-04 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330021837/http://www.rttnews.com/sp/todaystop.asp?item=3 | archivedate=2008-03-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of the conditions posed by the [[European Commission]] with regards to allowing the merger, on 29 May 2008 Suez sold its Belgian gas supplier [[Distrigas]] to the Italian company [[Eni]] for €2.7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2008/07/16/ap5220651.html|title=Key moments in GDF Suez combination|date=16 July 2008|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=2008-07-22}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 July 2008 the group [[GDF Suez]], a company of €74 billion of annual turnover, was officially created.&lt;ref name="Bloom" /&gt;

'''Terrence Higgins Trust''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[charitable organization|charity]] that campaigns on and provides services relating to [[HIV]] and [[sexual health]]. In particular, the charity aims to end the transmission of HIV in the UK; to support and empower people living with HIV; to eradicate stigma and discrimination around HIV; and to promote good sexual health (including [[safe sex]]).

The Trust is generally considered the UK's leading HIV and [[AIDS]] charity,&lt;ref name=ft/&gt; and the largest in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tht.org.uk/our-charity/Our-work/Our-history/How-it-all-began |title=How it all began |publisher=Terrence Higgins Trust |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the lead organisation for [[Public Health England]]'s HIV prevention partnership HIV Prevention England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hivpreventionengland.org.uk/|title=HIV Prevention England|publisher=HIV Prevention England|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Established in 1982, Terrence Higgins Trust was the first charity in the UK to be set up in response to HIV and AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FROM FEAR TO HOPE The Story of the Terrence Higgins Trust |author=Martin Hoskins |url=http://www.xed44.dial.pipex.com/webch1.htm |accessdate=2012-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010709020746/http://www.xed44.dial.pipex.com/webch1.htm |archivedate=July 9, 2001 }}{{cite web|url=http://www.tht.org.uk/our-charity/About-us/Our-history/How-it-all-began |accessdate=2012-09-27 |title=How it all began }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially named '''Terry''' Higgins Trust,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Julia Stuart|publisher=The Independent|title=Rupert Whitaker: 'I've lost 35 friends to HIV'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/rupert-whitaker-ive-lost-35-friends-to-hiv-749479.html|accessdate=2009-05-05 | location=London | date=2002-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Terry Higgins]], who died aged 37 on 4 July 1982 at [[St Thomas' Hospital]], [[London]]. He was among the first people in the UK known to have died from the AIDS virus, which was only identified the previous year.

Terry's close friends Martyn Butler, Tony Calvert and Terry's partner [[Rupert Whitaker]] along with other friends started the Trust to raise funds for research as a way of preventing suffering due to AIDS. Shortly, with the generation of a groundswell of support for the organisation at a meeting at Red Lion Square, Tony Whitehead and others joined the group and formally founded the organisation and saw it through registration as a charity to provide direct services to those affected by HIV. 

The trust was named after Terry to personalise and humanise the issue of AIDS. It was formalised in August 1983 when it adopted a constitution and opened a bank account, and the name of the trust was changed (''Terrence'' rather than ''Terry'') to sound more formal. It incorporated as a limited company in November 1983 and gained charitable status in January 1984.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Since its inception 12 years ago, most of its fund-raising events have been hip and low-key affairs, from its first disco at the London club Heaven to gala screenings of Dracula and the comedy shows Hysteria and Filth..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-aids-bash-comes-of-age-the-terrence-higgins-trust-facing-financial-cuts-and-attacks-in-the-press-1443973.html|title=The Aids bash comes of age: The Terrence Higgins Trust, facing financial cuts and attacks in the press, has taken its fund-raising up-market. |author=Simon Garfield|date=|website=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Hysteria 1'', was a comedy benefit for Terrence Higgins Trust, produced by Stephen Fry.&lt;ref name="tht.org.uk-our-history"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tht.org.uk/our-work/about-our-charity/our-history/1980s|title=1980s - our history|author=|date=|website=Terrence Higgins Trust|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hysteria 2'', September 18, 1989 at the Sadler's Wells Theatre in London, benefited Terrence Higgins Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTAFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=Hysteria|title=Monty Python: A Chronology, 1969–2012, 2d ed.|first=Douglas|last=McCall|date=8 November 2013|publisher=McFarland|accessdate=11 July 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; was produced by Stephen Fry, broadcast on [[Channel 4]], with a telethon.&lt;ref name="tht.org.uk-our-history"/&gt;

''Hysteria 3'', at the London Palladium on Sunday, June 30th, 1991, benefited Terrence Higgins Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004RW847S|title=Hysteria 3|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=11 July 2018|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Fry hosted, with Steven Wright, Hugh Laurie, Elton John, Ruby Wax, Rowan Atkinson, Eddie Izzard, Craig Ferguson, Lenny Henry, Julian Clary, Josie Lawrence, Jools Holland, Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, Ian McKellen, Edwin Starr, Clement Freud, Beverly Craven, Ben Elton, and Tony Slattery.

The charity received almost a million pounds in donations over the [[Christmas]] of 1991, with the proceeds of [[Queen (band)|Queen's]] re-released chart-topper [[Bohemian Rhapsody]] going entirely to the charity, following the recent AIDS-related death of lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brianmay.com/queen/rcjan92/rcjan92d.html |last=Duckett |first=Simon |title=Goldmine |date=10 August 2001 |accessdate=25 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After being diagnosed as HIV positive in 1987, Mercury had been concerned that financial support should be available to those less fortunate than himself.

[[Lisa Power]], former corporate head of policy at the Terrence Higgins Trust, denounced the views of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] on the use of condoms to prevent AIDS and said: "We deeply regret the continued misinformation around condoms, which remain the most effective way of preventing the spread of HIV.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/cameroon/5007124/Anger-as-Pope-Benedict-XVI-says-condoms-make-Aids-worse.html |title=Anger as Pope Benedict XVI says condoms make Aids worse |first=Nick |last=Pisa |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=17 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015 first-team players from [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] teamed up with 1980s band [[Erasure]] to record a charity version of the band's single "[[A Little Respect]]", with a third of the proceeds going to the trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dial2donate.org/rugby-players-show-a-little-respect-ahead-of-cup-final/ |title=Rugby players show A Little Respect ahead of cup final |publisher=Dial2Donate |accessdate=27 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moringa Project''' is an [[Australia]]-based [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] charitable organization committed to the development of sustainable healthcare facilities for underprivileged communities. Moringa Project's current campaign is the development of a sustainable clinic in [[Jharkhand]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://onehealthorganisation.org/projects/ One Health Organisation Collaborative Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Established in 2008,  Moringa Project (formerly Traditional Healthcare) began after two [[Australian people|Australian]] [[Acupuncture|acupuncturists]] travelled to the remote village of Pundag, India to volunteer their time.

The Pundag clinic was treating up to 70 patients a day and the volunteers were confronted with a wide range of ailments from simple aches and pains to very complicated disorders and [[Pathology|pathologies]]. The lack of facilities in the area saw patients travelling for up to three days to seek treatment.

The manager of the acupuncture clinic then took the volunteers to the even more remote village of Datom, to treat people who previously had never received any kind of medical treatment due to their isolation and [[poverty]]. Datom is a remote village located in the state of [[Jharkhand]]. With no medical facilities within a 100&amp;nbsp;km radius, the people of the area are in desperate need of healthcare. On arriving, the volunteers were shown to a dilapidated hut that was to be their clinic. Immediately the volunteers were overwhelmed with patients. There was an evident need for a healthcare clinic.

After seeing the success of the acupuncture clinic in Pundag, and the need for another clinic in Datom, Traditional Healthcare was established shortly after arriving back in Australia. The aim was to start construction of the Datom clinic in January 2010 and to raise $50,000AU to build and fit out the facility.

Changing its name in 2013, Traditional Healthcare, now Moringa Project, is run by Melbourne volunteers, who are not affiliated with any religious bodies.

==Sustainability==
Moringa Project endeavours to be self-sufficient by using wind and solar power, [[water conservation]], [[permaculture]], [[sustainable architecture]], recycled materials and traditional medicines. The aim of Moringa Project is not to be completely dependent on continual funding of each clinic, as the goal is self-sufficiency.

==Education==
An educational component is essential to the sustainability of the clinics. The educational program consists of two core elements: community education and practitioner training.

===Community development===
Moringa Project's buildings are designed according to environmentally sustainable principles. For example, the current project in Jharkhand (India) will be built with local renewable resources and be powered by solar and wind generators.

===Practitioner training===
Practitioner training will be provided at all of the facilities. First aid and hygiene will be taught at all facilities. Other programs will include acupuncture training (basic and advanced), herbal medicine, massage, mid-wifery, [[permaculture]], and medicinal herb cultivation.

==Projects==

===Current project===

The current project is the construction of a clinic in Datom, a remote village in the state of [[Jharkhand]], [[India]].

A practitioner provides an acupuncture service to the inhabitants of the village, however with no clinical facilities the number of patients treated in one day is rather limited. Those in need are treated in their houses in need in return for a small donation, as there are no other available healthcare facilities within approximately a 100&amp;nbsp;km radius.

The new facility is designed according to Moringa Project's principles of sustainability, incorporating environmental architecture and renewable energy sources such as [[Wind power|wind]] and [[solar power]]. The clinic will be able to treat up to 20 people at one time, allowing the treatment of up to 300 people per day. To begin with, the clinic will focus on acupuncture as the primary treatment because resources and practitioners are already available. However, Moringa Project wants to expand to incorporate a wider range of treatments. A class room, co-ordinator's office, medicinal herb garden and volunteer accommodation has been incorporated into the design. Construction began in January 2010 and continues with a team working in Datom during January 2012.&lt;!--ANCIENT NEWS IT IS NOW JULY 2013!!--&gt;

===Future projects===
More charitable projects are being planned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15049">'''Translational medicine''' (often referred to as [[translational science]], of which it is a form) is defined by the European Society for Translational Medicine (EUSTM) as "an interdisciplinary branch of the biomedical field supported by three main pillars: benchside, bedside, and community".&lt;ref name=Cohrs/&gt; The goal of TM is to combine disciplines, resources, expertise, and techniques within these pillars to promote enhancements in prevention, diagnosis, and therapies. Accordingly, translational medicine is a highly interdisciplinary field, the primary goal of which is to coalesce assets of various natures within the individual pillars in order to improve the global healthcare system significantly.&lt;ref name=Cohrs/&gt;

== History ==

Translational medicine is a rapidly growing discipline in biomedical research and aims to expedite the discovery of new diagnostic tools and treatments by using a multi-disciplinary, highly collaborative, "bench-to-bedside" approach.&lt;ref name=Woolf&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woolf|first1=Steven H.|title=The Meaning of Translational Research and Why It Matters|journal=JAMA|date=9 January 2008|volume=299|issue=2|doi=10.1001/jama.2007.26|pmid=18182604|url=http://medqi.bsd.uchicago.edu/documents/TranslationaltheoryT1T2WoolfJAMA1_08.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612200225/http://medqi.bsd.uchicago.edu/documents/TranslationaltheoryT1T2WoolfJAMA1_08.pdf|archivedate=12 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within public health, translational medicine is focused on ensuring that proven strategies for disease treatment and prevention are actually implemented within the community. One prevalent description of translational medicine, first introduced by the Institute of Medicine's Clinical Research Roundtable, highlights two roadblocks (i.e., distinct areas in need of improvement): the first translational block (T1) prevents basic research findings from being tested in a clinical setting; the second translational block (T2) prevents proven interventions from becoming standard practice.&lt;ref name=Woolf/&gt;

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has made a major push to fund translational medicine, especially within biomedical research, with a focus on cross-functional collaborations (e.g., between researchers  and clinicians); leveraging new technology and data analysis tools; and increasing the speed at which new treatments reach patients.  In December 2011, The National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS) was established within the NIH to "transform the translational science process so that new treatments and cures for disease can be delivered to patients faster."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncats.nih.gov/about/about.html|title=About NCATS - National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences|website=National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Clinical and Translational Science Awards, established in 2006 and now funded by NCATS, supports 60 centers across the country that provide "academic homes for translational sciences and supporting research resources needed by local and national research communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncats.nih.gov/research/cts/ctsa/about/about.html|title=Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program - National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences|website=National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article published in 2007 in Science Career Magazine, in 2007 to 2013 the European Commission targeted a majority of its €6 billion budget for health research to further translational medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2007_08_17/caredit.a0700119|title=European Programs Offer Translational Training|date=17 August 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training and education ==
In recent years, a number of educational programs have emerged to provide professional training in the skills necessary for successfully translating research into improved clinical outcomes. These programs go by various names (including Master of Translational Medicine and Master of Science in Bioinnovation). Many such programs emerge from bioengineering departments, often in collaboration with clinical departments.

The '''World Brewer's Cup''' is a competition which showcases the craft and skill of filter coffee [[brewing]] by hand, promoting manual coffee brewing and quality of service.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.worldbrewerscup.org&lt;/ref&gt; The contestants comes from around the world to compete in [[Melbourne, Australia]] only after winning the crown of their own [[Canadian Brewers Cup &amp; Cup Tasters|country]] first.  

The Championship takes place in [[Melbourne, Australia]] and runs from May 23 to May 26. Competitors are required to prepare and serve three separate beverages for a panel of judges.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldbrewerscup.org/judges/&lt;/ref&gt; The WCB consists of two rounds: a first round and a finalist round. In the first heat competitors are required to complete two coffee services, which are a compulsory service and an open service. For the compulsory service, competitors prepare three beverages utilizing whole bean coffee provided to them by the competition. For the open service, competitors may utilize any whole bean coffee of their choosing and must also accompany their beverage preparation with a presentation. The six competitors with the highest score from the first round will go on to compete in the finals round consisting exclusively of an open service. 
One competitor from the final round will be named the World Brewers Cup Champion.
The 2017 World Brewer's Cup takes place in Budapest, Hungary on June 13-15.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 


The following are different Types of Coffee Recipes from Past World Brewers Cup Competitions.
The first type of coffee was brewed by Sam Corra of Australia called ONA Coffee. He brewed Whole Cherry Carbonic wash processed Green-tip Geisha from Finca Deborah in Panama using a Hario V60 brewer. The method used was by splitting 300mL water into five pours with a dose of 20g coffee ground coarsely.
The second type of coffee was by Stathis Koremtas of Greece called Taf Coffee. He brewed National processed Ninety Plus using a Hario V60 brewer. The method used was a 30-second bloom with 15g coffee to 250mL of 92°C  water.
The third type of coffee was brewed by Costantin Hoppenz of Germany called Bonanza Coffee. He brewed washedd SL-28 and SL-34 coffee from Kenya. He used the method 30 second 30mL bloom with a V60-like glass brewer. Costantin used a dose of 14g to 230mL 90°C water.
The forth type of coffee brewed was by Chad Wang of Taiwan called Jascaffe China. The coffee used was Natural processed ninety plus panama geisha with a ceramic Hario V60. The method used was 30 second bloom and after bloom pour rest of water directly in the center of the brewer meaning no circles. He used a dose of 15g coffee to 250mL of 92°C  water.
The fifth type of coffee was by Petra Strelecka form Industra Coffee in Czech Republic. She used 70/30 blend of Ninety Plus Hot-Fermented Lotus Geisha and Honey-Processed Juliet Geisha with a plastic Hario V60. The method used was pulse pour 50g water every 30 seconds with a dose of 14.8g coffee to 250mL of 95°C water.
The sixth type of coffee was by Michael Manhart of Austria. The coffee used was Natural Processed Nyasaland Variety Uganda with a Custom ceramic brewer similar to a Kalita Wave. The method used was add 250mL of 94°C Third Wave Water with a dose of 16g coffee, coarsely ground.
