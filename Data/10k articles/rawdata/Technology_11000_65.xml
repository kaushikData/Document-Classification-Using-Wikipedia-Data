      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2619">The '''ATM Forum''' was founded in 1991 to be the industry consortium to promote [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] technology used in [[telecommunication]] networks; the founding president and chairman was [[Fred Sammartino]] of [[Sun Microsystems]].  It was a non-profit international organization.  The ATM Forum created over 200 implementation agreements.

==History==
In 1996 ATM technology stabilized with the "Anchorage Accord", which established the baseline of ATM implementations.  While ATM did not live up to every expectation, it remained an important core network technology. 
The Frame Relay Forum (promoting [[frame relay]]) also started in 1991. The MPLS Forum (which supported [[Multiprotocol Label Switching]]  had begun in 2000. Those two merged in 2003 to become the MPLS and Frame Relay Alliance (MFA).
In 2005, the ATM Forum joined forces with the MFA to form the MFA Forum, which was renamed to be the IP/MPLS Forum.
In May 2009 the  IP/MPLS Forum merged with the [[Broadband Forum]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{Cite web |title= About the Broadband Forum: Forum History |url= https://www.broadband-forum.org/about-the-broadband-forum/about-the-forum/mission-and-vision }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sampling of specifications==
* ATM-MPLS Network Interworking
* Multi-Protocol Over ATM
* TM 4.1
* User-Network Interface
* B-ICI
* ANNI
* [[PNNI]]
* Frame-based ATM
* ILMI
* 622.08 Mbit/s physical layer
* Inverse ATM Mux
* Circuit Emulation Service

==Circuit Emulation Service==
A widely adopted specification to emerge from the ATM Forum was the Circuit Emulation Service specification (CES).  This specification defined a method of creating a service out of mapping [[Time-division multiplexing|TDM]] [[Digital Signal 0|DS0]] and [[Digital Signal 1|DS1]]/E1 [[Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy]] (PDH) signals into [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) cells.  It also supported J2 and DS-3 signals.  The service was built around the [[ATM Adaptation Layers|ATM Adaption Layer 1]] specification from the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]].  The 1.0 version was approved about 1995 and the 2.0 version was approved in January 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://broadband-forum.org/ftp/pub/approved-specs/af-vtoa-0078.000.pdf ATM Forum Circuit Emulation Service specification 2.0]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''accounting machine''', or '''bookkeeping machine''' or '''recording-adder''', was generally a calculator and printer combination tailored for a specific commercial activity such as billing, payroll, or ledger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Turck |first = J.A.V. | title = Origin of Modern calculating Machines | publisher = The Western Society of Engineers | year = 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cortada&gt;{{cite book| last = Cortada | first = James W |title = Before the Computer; IBM, NCR, Burroughs &amp; Remmington Rand &amp; The Industry They Created 1865-1956 |publisher = Princeton University Press | year =1993  |isbn =0-691-04807-X | pages = 158–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accounting machines were widespread from the early 1900s to 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Akera |first = Atsushi |author2= Nebeker, Frederik |title = From 0 to 1: An Authoritative History of Modern Computing |publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 2002 | isbn = 0-19-514025-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but were rendered obsolete by the availability of low-cost computers such as the [[IBM PC]].

[[Image:aerialimagecamera.jpg|thumb|150px|A special effects movie camera stand with aerial image capabilities.]]
An '''aerial image''' is a projected image which is "floating in air", and cannot be viewed normally. It can only be seen from one position in space, often focused by another lens. 

Aerial image technology was used in [[optical printer]]s and movie [[special effects]] photography before the advent of [[computer graphics]] in movie production, and also for combining [[traditional animation|animation]] and live action footage onto one piece of film.

      <comment>/* Gain */clean up using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12070">In [[electronics]], the '''figures of merit''' of an [[amplifier]] are numerical measures that characterize its properties and performance. [[Figures of merit]] can be given as a list of [[Specification (technical standard)|specifications]] that include properties such as [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] and [[Nonlinear system|linearity]], among others listed in this article. Figures of merit are important for determining the suitability of a particular amplifier for an intended use.

== Gain ==
The [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of an amplifier is the ratio of output to input power or amplitude, and is usually measured in [[decibel]]s. When measured in decibels it is [[logarithm]]ically related to the power ratio: ''G''(dB)=10 log(''P&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;'' /''P&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;''). [[Radio frequency|RF]] amplifiers are often specified in terms of the maximum ''power gain'' obtainable, while the [[voltage]] gain of audio amplifiers and [[instrumentation amplifier]]s will be more often specified. For example, an audio amplifier with a gain given as 20&amp;nbsp;dB will have a ''voltage gain'' of ten.

The use of voltage gain figure is appropriate when the amplifier's [[input impedance]] is much higher than the source impedance, and the load impedance higher than the amplifier's output impedance.

If two equivalent amplifiers are being compared, the amplifier with higher gain settings would be more sensitive as it would take less input signal to produce a given amount of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bcae1.com/gaincon2.htm |title=Amplifier Gain Controls |access-date=2017-11-11}}{{unreliable source?|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bandwidth ==
The [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of an amplifier is the range of frequencies for which the amplifier gives "satisfactory performance". The definition of "satisfactory performance" may be different for different applications. However, a common and well-accepted metric is the [[half-power point]]s (i.e. frequency where the power goes down by half its peak value) on the output vs. frequency curve. Therefore, bandwidth can be defined as the difference between the lower and upper half power points. This is therefore also known as the {{nowrap|−3 dB}} bandwidth. Bandwidths (otherwise called "frequency responses") for other response tolerances are sometimes quoted ({{nowrap|−1 dB}}, {{nowrap|−6 dB}} etc.) or "plus or minus 1dB" (roughly the sound level difference people usually can detect).

The gain of a good quality full-range audio amplifier will be essentially flat between 20&amp;nbsp;Hz to about 20&amp;nbsp;kHz (the range of normal human [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]). In ultra-high-fidelity amplifier design, the amplifier's frequency response should extend considerably beyond this (one or more [[Octave (electronics)|octaves]] either side) and might have {{nowrap|−3 dB}} points &lt; 10&amp;nbsp;Hz and &gt; {{nowrap|65&amp;nbsp;kHz}}. Professional touring amplifiers often have input and/or output filtering to sharply limit frequency response beyond {{nowrap|20&amp;nbsp;Hz-20&amp;nbsp;kHz}}; too much of the amplifier's potential output power would otherwise be wasted on [[infrasonic]] and [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] frequencies, and the danger of AM [[radio interference]] would increase. Modern [[switching amplifier]]s need steep [[Low-pass filter|low pass filtering]] at the output to get rid of high-frequency switching noise and [[harmonic]]s.

The range of frequency over which the gain is equal to or greater than 70.7% of its maximum gain is termed as bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=8fmUCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=The+range+of+frequency+over+which+the+gain+is+equal+to+or+greater+than+70.7%25+of+its+maximum+gain+is+termed+as+bandwidth.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UiyAJfkHux&amp;sig=axRzYlWGT-a1KtC4wwq3nuga7rI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBnJ3YirnYAhVLPI8KHW4sBhAQ6AEIMzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20range%20of%20frequency%20over%20which%20the%20gain%20is%20equal%20to%20or%20greater%20than%2070.7%25%20of%20its%20maximum%20gain%20is%20termed%20as%20bandwidth.&amp;f=false|title=PRINCIPLES OF ELECTRONICS|last=KUMAR|first=GANGULY, PARTHA|date=2015-09-16|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=9788120351240|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Efficiency ==
Efficiency is a measure of how much of the power source is usefully applied to the amplifier's output. [[Electronic amplifier#Power amplifier classes|Class A]] amplifiers are very inefficient, in the range of 10–20% with a max efficiency of 25% for [[direct coupling]] of the output. [[Inductive coupling]] of the output can raise their efficiency to a maximum of 50%.

Drain efficiency is the ratio of output RF power to input DC power when primary input DC power has been fed to the drain of a [[field-effect transistor]]. Based on this definition, the drain efficiency cannot exceed 25% for a class A amplifier that is supplied drain bias current through resistors (because RF signal has its zero level at about 50% of the input DC). Manufacturers specify much higher drain efficiencies, and designers are able to obtain higher efficiencies by providing current to the drain of the transistor through an inductor or a transformer winding.  In this case the RF zero level is near the DC rail and will swing both above and below the rail during operation.  While the voltage level is above the DC rail current is supplied by the inductor.

Class B amplifiers have a very high efficiency but are impractical for audio work because of high levels of distortion (See: [[Crossover distortion]]). In practical design, the result of a tradeoff is the class AB design. Modern Class AB amplifiers commonly have peak efficiencies between 30–55% in audio systems and 50-70% in radio frequency systems with a theoretical maximum of 78.5%.

Commercially available Class D [[switching amplifier]]s have reported efficiencies as high as 90%. Amplifiers of Class C-F are usually known to be very high-efficiency amplifiers. RCA manufactured an AM broadcast transmitter employing a single class-C low-mu triode with an RF efficiency in the 90% range.

More efficient amplifiers run cooler, and often do not need any cooling fans even in multi-kilowatt designs. The reason for this is that the loss of efficiency produces heat as a by-product of the energy lost during the conversion of power. In more efficient amplifiers there is less loss of energy so in turn less heat.

In RF linear Power Amplifiers, such as cellular base stations and broadcast transmitters, special design techniques can be used to improve efficiency.  Doherty designs, which use a second output stage as a "peak" amplifier, can lift efficiency from the typical 15% up to 30-35% in a narrow bandwidth.  Envelope Tracking designs are able to achieve efficiencies of up to 60%, by modulating the supply voltage to the amplifier in line with the envelope of the signal.

== Linearity{{anchor|linearity}} ==
An ideal amplifier would be a totally linear device, but real amplifiers are only linear within limits.

When the signal drive to the amplifier is increased, the output also increases until a point is reached where some part of the amplifier becomes saturated and cannot produce any more output; this is called clipping, and results in [[distortion]].

In most amplifiers a reduction in gain takes place before hard clipping occurs; the result is a ''compression'' effect, which (if the amplifier is an audio amplifier) sounds much less unpleasant to the ear. For these amplifiers, the 1&amp;nbsp;dB compression point is defined as the input power (or output power) where the gain is 1&amp;nbsp;dB less than the small signal gain. Sometimes this non linearity is deliberately designed in to reduce the audible unpleasantness of hard clipping under overload.

Ill effects of non-linearity can be reduced with negative feedback.

[[Linearization]] is an emergent field, and there are many techniques, such as [[Feed forward (control)|feed forward]], [[predistortion]], postdistortion, in order to avoid the undesired effects of the non-linearities.

== Noise ==
This is a measure of how much [[noise]] is introduced in the amplification process. Noise is an undesirable but inevitable product of the electronic devices and components; also, much noise results from intentional economies of manufacture and design time. The metric for noise performance of a circuit is [[noise figure]] or noise factor. Noise figure is a comparison between the output signal to noise ratio and the thermal noise of the input signal.

== Output dynamic range ==
Output [[dynamic range]] is the range, usually given in dB, between the smallest and largest useful output levels. The lowest useful level is limited by output [[noise]], while the largest is limited most often by distortion. The ratio of these two is quoted as the amplifier dynamic range. More precisely, if ''S'' = maximal allowed signal power and ''N'' = noise power, the dynamic range ''DR'' is ''DR = (S + N ) /N''.&lt;ref name=Verhoeven&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In many switched mode amplifiers, dynamic range is limited by the minimum output step size.

== Slew rate ==
[[Slew rate]] is the maximum rate of change of the output, usually quoted in volts per second (or microsecond). Many amplifiers are ultimately [[slew rate]] limited (typically by the impedance of a drive current having to overcome capacitive effects at some point in the circuit), which sometimes limits the full [[power bandwidth]] to frequencies well below the amplifier's small-signal frequency response.

== Rise time ==
The [[rise time]], t&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, of an amplifier is the time taken for the output to change from 10% to 90% of its final level when driven by a [[step response|step input]].
For a [[Gaussian]] response system (or a simple RC [[roll-off|roll off]]), the rise time is approximated by:

'''t&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; * BW = 0.35''', where t&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is rise time in [[second]]s and BW is bandwidth in [[hertz|Hz]].

== Settling time and ringing ==
The time taken for the output to settle to within a certain percentage of the final value (for instance 0.1%) is called the [[settling time]], and is usually specified for oscilloscope vertical amplifiers and high-accuracy measurement systems. [[Ringing (signal)|Ringing]] refers to an output variation that cycles above and below an amplifier's final value and leads to a delay in reaching a stable output.  Ringing is the result of overshoot caused by an [[Damping#Under-damping (0 ≤ ζ &lt; 1)|underdamped]] circuit.

== Overshoot ==
In response to a step input, the [[overshoot (signal)|overshoot]] is the amount the output exceeds its final, steady-state value.

== Stability ==
Stability is an issue in all amplifiers with feedback, whether that feedback is added intentionally or results unintentionally. It is especially an issue when applied over multiple amplifying stages.

[[BIBO stability|Stability]] is a major concern in [[Radio frequency|RF]] and [[microwave]] amplifiers. The degree of an amplifier's stability can be quantified by a so-called stability factor. There are several different stability factors, such as the Stern stability factor and the Linvil stability factor, which specify a condition that must be met for the absolute stability of an amplifier in terms of its [[two-port parameters]].

[[File:Symphony Hall Birmingham.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Symphony Hall, Birmingham]], an example of the application of architectural acoustics.]]
'''Architectural acoustics''' (also known as '''[[room acoustics]]''' and '''building acoustics''') is the science and engineering of achieving a good sound within a building and is a branch of [[acoustical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morfey|first=Christopher|title=Dictionary of Acoustics|year=2001|publisher=Academic Press|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first application of modern scientific methods to architectural acoustics was carried out by [[Wallace Sabine]] in the [[Fogg Museum]] lecture room who then applied his new found knowledge to the design of [[Symphony Hall, Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sabine|first=Wallace Clement|title=Collected papers on acoustics|year=1922|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architectural acoustics can be about achieving good [[Intelligibility (communication)|speech intelligibility]] in a theatre, restaurant or railway station, enhancing the quality of music in a concert hall or recording studio, or suppressing noise to make offices and homes more productive and pleasant places to work and live in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Templeton|first=Duncan|title=Acoustics in the Built Environment: Advice for the Design Team|year=1993|publisher=Architectural Press|isbn=978-0750605380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural acoustic design is usually done by acoustic consultants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Careers Service|title=Job profiles Acoustics consultant|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/acousticsconsultant.aspx}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building skin envelope ==
This science analyzes noise transmission from building exterior envelope to interior and vice versa. The main noise paths are [[roofs]], [[eaves]], [[wall]]s, [[window]]s, [[door]] and penetrations. Sufficient control ensures space functionality and is often required based on building use and local municipal codes. An example would be providing a suitable design for a home which is to be constructed close to a high volume roadway, or under the flight path of a major airport, or of the airport itself.

== Inter-space noise control ==
The science of limiting and/or controlling noise transmission from one building space to another to ensure space functionality and speech privacy. The typical sound paths are ceilings, room partitions, acoustic [[ceiling]] panels (such as wood [[dropped ceiling]] panels), [[door]]s, [[window]]s, flanking, [[Duct (HVAC)|ducting]] and other penetrations. Technical solutions depend on the source of the noise and the path of [[acoustic transmission]], for example noise by steps or noise by (air, water) flow vibrations. An example would be providing suitable [[party wall]] design in an [[apartment complex]] to  minimize the mutual disturbance due to noise by residents in adjacent apartments.

== Interior space acoustics ==
[[Image:quadratic diffusor.gif|thumb|right|Diffusers which scatter sound are used in some rooms to improve the acoustics]] This is the [[science]] of controlling a room's [[Surface science|surfaces]] based on sound absorbing and reflecting properties.  Excessive [[reverberation time]], which can be calculated, can lead to poor speech intelligibility.

[[File:Heichal Hatarbut1.jpg|thumb|400px|Ceiling of [[Culture Palace (Tel Aviv)]] concert hall is covered with [[perforated metal]] panels]]

Sound reflections create standing waves that produce natural resonances that can be heard as a pleasant sensation or an annoying one.&lt;ref&gt;Glen Ballou &amp; Howards Sams, editors. "Handbook for Sound Engineers",  page 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflective surfaces can be angled and coordinated to provide good coverage of sound for a listener in a concert hall or music recital space. To illustrate this concept consider the difference between a modern large office meeting room or lecture theater and a traditional [[classroom]] with all hard surfaces.

[[File:anechoic chamber.jpg|thumb|250px|An [[anechoic chamber]], using acoustic absorption to create a "dead" space.]]
Interior building surfaces can be constructed of many different materials and finishes. Ideal acoustical panels are those without a face or finish material that interferes with the acoustical infill or substrate.  [[textile|Fabric]] covered panels are one way to heighten acoustical absorption. [[Perforated metal]] also shows sound absorbing qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=William|title=Perforated metal systems as sound absorbing surfaces|year=2007|volume=February|url=http://www.ssaacoustics.com/newspublications/perforated%20metal%20systems%20as%20sound%20absorbative%20surf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finish material is used to cover over the acoustical substrate. Mineral fiber board, or [[Micore]], is a commonly used acoustical substrate. Finish materials often consist of fabric, wood or acoustical tile. Fabric can be wrapped around substrates to create what is referred to as a "pre-fabricated panel" and often provides good noise absorption if laid onto a wall.

Prefabricated panels are limited to the size of the substrate ranging from {{convert|2|x|4|ft|m}} to {{convert|4|x|10|ft|m}}.  Fabric retained in a wall-mounted perimeter track system, is referred to as "on-site acoustical wall panels". This is constructed by framing the perimeter track into shape, infilling the acoustical substrate and then stretching and tucking the fabric into the perimeter frame system. On-site wall panels can be constructed to accommodate door frames, baseboard, or any other intrusion. Large panels (generally, greater than {{convert|50|sqft|m2}}) can be created on walls and [[ceiling]]s with this method.  Wood finishes can consist of punched or routed slots and provide a natural look to the interior space, although acoustical absorption may not be great.

There are four ways to improve workplace acoustics and solve workplace sound problems – the ABCDs.
*A = Absorb (via drapes, carpets, ceiling tiles, etc.)
*B = Block (via panels, walls, floors, ceilings and layout)
*C = Cover-up (via sound masking)
*D = [[Diffusion_(acoustics)|Diffuse]] (cause the sound energy to spread by radiating in many directions)

== Mechanical equipment noise ==
Building services noise control is the science of controlling noise produced by:
*ACMV (air conditioning and mechanical ventilation) systems in buildings, termed [[HVAC]] in [[North America]]
*[[Elevator]]s
*[[Electrical generator]]s positioned within or attached to a building
*Any other building service infrastructure component that emits sound.

Inadequate control may lead to elevated [[Sound intensity level|sound level]]s within the space which can be annoying and reduce speech intelligibility.  Typical improvements are [[vibration isolation]] of mechanical equipment, and [[sound traps]] in ductwork.  [[Sound masking]] can also be created by adjusting HVAC noise to a predetermined level.

A '''baggage handling system''' (BHS) is a type of [[Conveyor belt|conveyor]] system installed in [[airport]]s that transports checked [[luggage]] from ticket counters to areas where the bags can be loaded onto [[airplane]]s. A BHS also transports checked baggage coming from airplanes to baggage claims or to an area where the bag can be loaded onto another airplane.

Although the primary function of a BHS is the transportation of bags, a typical BHS will serve other functions involved in making sure that a bag gets to the correct location in the airport. ''Sortation'' is the process of identifying a bag and the information associated with it, to decide where the bag should be directed within the system.

In addition to sortation, a BHS may also perform the  following functions:
*  Detection of bag jams
*  Volume regulation (to ensure that input points are controlled to avoid overloading system)
*  Load balancing (to evenly distribute bag volume between conveyor sub-systems)
*  Bag counting
*  Bag tracking
*  Redirection of bags via pusher or diverter
*  Automatic Tag Reader (ATR) (Reads the tags on the luggage provided by the airlines)

There is an entire process that the BHS controls. From the moment the bag is set on the inbound conveyor, to the gathering conveyor, through sorting until it arrives at the designated aircraft and onto the baggage carousel after the flight, the BHS has control over the bag

Many baggage handling systems offer software to better manage the system. There has also been a breakthrough with "mobile" BHS software where managers of the system can check and correct problems from their mobile phone.

Post [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], the majority of airports around the world began to implement baggage screening directly into BHS systems.  These systems are referred to as "Checked Baggage Inspection System" by the [[Transportation Security Administration]] (TSA) in the USA, where bags are fed directly into [[Explosive Detection System]] (EDS) machines.  A CBIS can sort baggage based on each bag's security status assigned by an EDS machine or by a security screening operator.

The first [[Automation|automated]] baggage handling system was invented by [[BNP Associates]] in 1971, and this technology is in use in almost every major airport worldwide today.

'''Bristle blasting''' is a [[Abrasion (mechanical)|mechanical abrasion]] cleaning process that is performed on metallic surfaces by a brush-like rotary [[power tool]]. The tool consists of sharpened, high-carbon steel wire bristle tips that are designed with a forward-angle bend, i.e., the shank of the wire is bent in the direction of tool rotation. During operation, the rotating bristle tips are brought into direct contact with the metallic surface, whereby the bristle tips strike the surface with kinetic energy that is equivalent to processes that use grit blast media. This repeated contact of sharp bristle tips with the target surface results in localized impact, rebound, and the formation of craters, thereby simultaneously cleaning and coarsening the surface, while exposing a contamination-free base metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences from conventional rotary brushes ==
The difference from conventional wire-brushing with an [[angle grinder]] lies first with the mounting of the bristles in the rotating brush. With a conventional rotary brush, the wire bristles are mounted rigidly in the hub, bristles sometimes being twisted or knotted in groups for extra stiffness. With bristle blasting, the wires are mounted resiliently in a flexible belt. As the brush rotates, immediately before contacting the work, rows of bristles are trapped behind a fixed '' 'accelerator bar' '',&lt;ref name="Monti, High speed video" &gt;{{Youtube|ce0wLgs6sZA|Monti MBX Bristle Blaster, High-Speed Video}}, Monti Surface Technologies&lt;/ref&gt; which causes them to bend backwards in their flexible mount. As the bristles pass the accelerator bar, they are released to spring forwards. The extra energy stored for each bristle when being flexed backwards is added to their kinetic energy when released, and when they impact the surface of the workpiece. This gives a more violent impact with the surface, thus greater cleaning power, compared to a simple rotary brush at the same speed.

As the geometry of the brush is also distorted from circular by the accelerator bar, the contact angle of the bristle tips with the surface is also nearer to perpendicular than the [[tangent]]ial contact of the circular rotary brush. This encourages a cleaning action and reduces the [[burnishing (metal)|burnishing]] action that can be a problem with rotary brushes, where a surface is increasingly polished, but not truly cleaned of surface adherrents. The steeper action of the tips encourages a pitting effect on the surface, which may be considered useful for further painting.&lt;ref name="Monti, High speed video" /&gt;

== Details ==
The cleaning performance of the bristle blasting process is a consequence of synchronized impact of the bristle tips onto the target surface. The tool head with the bristle belt rotates at approximately 2,500 rpm. A so-called 'accelerator bar' detains the bristle tips and by releasing them increases their kinetic energy with which they strike the surface. Immediately after the bristles strike the corroded steel surface, they retract (rebound) from the surface ('single-impact'), which results in corrosion removal and a micro-identation that exposes the sheer metallic surface. The multitude of such primary impact craters generates a texture and surface which in visual cleanliness and [[Surface roughness|roughness]] (anchor profile) mimics those obtained by grit blasting processes.&lt;ref name="Monti, High speed video" /&gt; The cleaned and coarsened surface is deemed favorable for the subsequent application and adhesion of protective films and [[industrial coating]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Process and equipment ==
Bristle blasting tools are fabricated from high-carbon steel wires that protrude through a flexible circular belt. The belt, in turn, is attached to a rotating hub, which is powered by an electric or pneumatically driven spindle. The tool is lightweight, portable, and easily implemented by workers without the need for elaborate set-up or sophisticated safety apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Applications ==
Bristle blasting is most frequently used for removal of unwanted films and layers of [[corrosion]] that can form on metallic surfaces. Common applications include cleaning, preparation, and refurbishment of iron and steel components that are used for fabricating bridges, ships, and pipeline systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A '''built-in self-test''' ('''BIST''') or '''built-in test''' ('''BIT''') is a mechanism that permits a machine to test itself.  Engineers design BISTs to meet requirements such as:

*high [[Reliability engineering|reliability]]
*lower [[Repair cycle|repair cycle times]]

or constraints such as:

*limited technician accessibility
*cost of testing during manufacture

The main purpose{{fact|date=September 2012}} of BIST is to reduce the complexity, and thereby decrease the cost and reduce reliance upon external (pattern-programmed) test equipment.  BIST reduces cost in two ways:
# reduces test-cycle duration
# reduces the complexity of the test/probe setup, by reducing the number of I/O signals that must be driven/examined under tester control.
Both lead to a reduction in hourly charges for automated test equipment (ATE) service.

==Naming==

The BIST name and concept originated with the idea of including a [[pseudorandom number generator]] (PRNG) and [[cyclic redundancy check]] (CRC) on the IC.  If all the registers that hold state in an IC are on one or more internal scan chains, then the function of the registers and the [[combinational logic]] between them will generate a unique CRC signature over a large enough sample of random inputs.  So all an IC need do is store the expected CRC signature and test for it after a large enough sample set from the PRNG. The CRC comparison with expected signature or the actual resultant CRC signature is typically accessed via the [[Joint Test Action Group|JTAG]] [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] 1149.1 standard.

==Applications==

BIST is commonplace in [[weapon]]s, [[avionics]], [[medical device]]s, [[automobile|automotive electronics]], complex machinery of all types, unattended machinery of all types, and [[integrated circuit]]s.

===Automotive===
{{main|On-board diagnostics}}

Automotive tests itself to enhance safety and reliability.  For example, most vehicles with antilock brakes test them once per safety interval.  If the [[antilock brake system]] has a broken wire or other fault, the brake system reverts to operating as a normal brake system.  Most automotive engine controllers incorporate a "limp mode" for each sensor, so that the engine will continue to operate if the sensor or its wiring fails.  Another, more trivial example of a limp mode is that some cars test door switches, and automatically turn lights on using seat-belt occupancy sensors if the door switches fail.

===Aviation===

Almost all avionics now incorporate BIST.  In avionics, the purpose is to isolate failing [[line-replaceable unit]]s, which are then removed and repaired elsewhere, usually in depots or at the [[original equipment manufacturer|manufacturer]].  Commercial aircraft only make money when they fly, so they use BIST to minimize the time on the ground needed for repair and to increase the level of safety of the system which contains BIST.  Similar arguments apply to military aircraft.  When BIST is used in flight, a fault causes the system to switch to an alternative mode or equipment that still operates.  Critical flight equipment is normally duplicated, or redundant.  Less critical flight equipment, such as entertainment systems, might have a "limp mode" that provides some functions.

===Electronics===

====Integrated circuit manufacturing====

Built-In-Self-Test is used to make faster, less-expensive [[integrated circuit]] manufacturing tests. The IC has a function that verifies all or a portion of the internal functionality of the IC.  In some cases, this is valuable to customers, as well.  For example, a BIST mechanism is provided in advanced [[fieldbus]] systems to verify functionality.  At a high level this can be viewed similar to the PC [[BIOS]]'s power-on self-test (POST) that performs a self-test of the [[Random-access memory|RAM]] and buses on power-up.

====Computers====

The typical personal computer tests itself at start-up (called [[Power-on self-test|POST]]) because it's a very complex piece of machinery.  Since it includes a computer, a computerized self-test was an obvious, inexpensive feature. Most modern computers, including [[embedded system]]s, have self-tests of their computer, memory and software.

====Unattended machinery====

Unattended machinery performs self-tests to discover whether it needs maintenance or repair.  Typical tests are for temperature, humidity, bad communications, burglars, or a bad [[power supply]].  For example, power systems or batteries are often under stress, and can easily overheat or fail.  So, they are often tested.

Often the communication test is a critical item in a remote system. One of the most common, and unsung unattended system is the humble telephone concentrator box.  This contains complex electronics to accumulate telephone lines or data and route it to a central switch.   Telephone concentrators  test for communications continuously, by verifying the presence of periodic data patterns called frames (See [[SONET]]).  Frames repeat about 8,000 times per second.  

Remote systems often have tests to loop-back the communications locally, to test transmitter and receiver, and remotely, to test the communication link without using the computer or software at the remote unit.  Where electronic loop-backs are absent, the software usually provides the facility.  For example, [[Internet Protocol|IP]] defines a local address which is a software loopback (IP-Address 127.0.0.1, usually locally mapped to name "localhost").  

Many remote systems have automatic reset features to restart their remote computers.  These can be triggered by lack of communications, improper software operation or other critical events.  Satellites have automatic reset, and add automatic restart systems for power and [[attitude control]], as well.

===Medicine===

Medical devices test themselves to assure their continued safety.  Normally there are two tests.  A [[power-on self-test]] (POST) will perform a comprehensive test.  Then, a periodic test will assure that the device has not become unsafe since the power-on self test.  Safety-critical devices normally define a "safety interval", a period of time too short for injury to occur.  The self test of the most critical functions normally is completed at least once per safety interval. The periodic test is normally a subset of the power-on self test.

===Military===

One of the first computer-controlled BIST systems was in the U.S.'s [[Minuteman Missile]].{{Cn|date=January 2018}} Using an internal computer to control the testing reduced the weight of cables and connectors for testing.  The Minuteman was one of the first major weapons systems to field a permanently installed computer-controlled self-test.

==Specializations==

There are several specialized versions of BIST which are differentiated according to what they do or how they are implemented:

* [[pBIST | Programmable built-in self-test]] (pBIST)
* Memory built-in self-test (mBIST) - e.g. with the Marinescu algorithm&lt;ref&gt;Marinescu, M., 1982. Simple and Efficient Algorithms for Functional RAM Testing. 1982 IEEE Test Conference, Philadelphia, (Nov.). IEEE Computer Society, pp. 236-239.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[LBIST|Logic built-in self-test]]
* Analog and mixed-signal built-in self-test (AMBIST)
* Continuous built-in self-test (CBIST, C-BIT)
* Event-driven built-in self-test, such as the BIST done to an aircraft's systems after the aircraft lands.
* Periodic built-in self-test (C-BIT/P-BIT)
* Interrupt-driven built-in self-test (IBIST) or user/operator-initiated built-in self-test (I-BIT, or O-BIT)
* Power-up built-in self-test (PupBIST, P-BIT)
* Automatic built-in self-test (ABIST)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3702">'''Capacitance sensors''' (or Dielectric sensors) use [[capacitance]] to measure the [[dielectric]] [[permittivity]] of a surrounding medium. 
The configuration is like the neutron probe where an access tube made of PVC is installed in the soil; probes can also be modular (comb-like) and connected to a logger. The sensing head consists of an oscillator circuit, the frequency is determined by an annular electrode, fringe-effect [[capacitor]], and the dielectric constant of the soil. 
Each capacitor sensor consists of two metal rings mounted on the circuit board at some distance from the top of the access tube. These rings are a pair of electrodes, which form the plates of the capacitor with the soil acting as the dielectric in between. The plates are connected to an oscillator, consisting of an inductor and a capacitor. The oscillating electrical field is generated between the two rings and extends into the soil medium through the wall of the access tube. The capacitor and the oscillator form a circuit, and changes in dielectric constant of surrounding media are detected by changes in the operating frequency. The capacitance sensors are designed to oscillate in excess of 100&amp;nbsp;MHz inside the access tube in free air. The output of the sensor is the frequency response of the soil’s capacitance due to its soil moisture level.

==Applications==
* One application for such a device is measuring the [[water]] content of [[soil]], where the volume of water in the total volume of soil most heavily influences the dielectric permittivity of the soil because the dielectric of water (80) is much greater than the other constituents of the soil (mineral soil: 4, organic matter: 4, air: 1). When the amount of water changes in the soil, a probe will measure a change in capacitance due to the change in dielectric permittivity that can be directly correlated with a change in water content.  Capacitance sensors are now widely used in [[irrigation scheduling]] in agriculture around the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
* [[Cure monitoring]] of [[Composite materials]]: Dielectric or capacitance sensors are used to measure the electrical response of [[thermoset]] [[resins]] and matrices of composite materials at specified depth over the sensor surface. The key model involved in the use of these sensors is the electric field model. The correspondence between electrical properties of the material within the field and the measurement (i.e. capacitance) is fundamental in interpreting the readings from the dielectric sensor.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
* Tip clearance measurement in turbomachinery testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sheard|first1=A. G.|title=Blade by Blade Tip Clearance Measurement|journal=International Journal of Rotating Machinery|date=20 June 2011|volume=2011|pages=13|doi=10.1155/2011/516128}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The capacitance-sensors also can be used for the measuring of level of some solid materials in structures such as hoppers or silos.

'''Class districts''' ({{lang-de|Gattungsbezirke}}) were a classification system for railway [[goods wagon]]s used by the  [[Deutsche Reichsbahn (1920–1945)]] in Germany between the wars.

After the Deutsche Reichsbahn had been founded in 1920, in 1921 all goods wagons types with the same or similar roles were grouped into so-called class districts. These were named after cities that were the headquarters of a Reichsbahn division or, later, other cities too. Work on re-lettering and renaming the wagons began in 1922 and was largely completed by 1924.

[[File:Knobs-for-climate-control.jpg|thumb|250px|Two control knobs for a heating/cooling system. The left knob controls the temperature while the right controls the fan speed.]]
A '''control knob''' is a rotary control used to provide input to a device when grasped by an operator and turned, so that the degree of rotation corresponds to the desired input. Such knobs are one of the most common components in [[control systems]] and are found on all sorts of devices.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/b?node=16412811&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Such knobs vary greatly in form, but as a rule they are expected to be grasped by the fingertips. By convention a clockwise rotation ordinarily produces an "increased" input, whatever that is understood to be. Knobs may turn continuously or may have detents to produce discrete selections; they commonly have a scale with a pointer to aid achievement of the desired setting, though it is common for the gradations in the scale to have no concrete meaning (e.g. the markings of a volume control). There is frequently a fixed "off" position at the origin of movement in which the knob actuates a switch shutting down whatever behavior is controlled, rather than having a separate on/off switch.

==Operation==
A control knob works by turning a shaft which connects to the component which produces the actual input. Common control components used include [[potentiometer]]s, [[variable capacitor]]s, and [[rotary switch]]es. An example where the knob does not produce a variation in an electrical signal may be found in many [[toaster]]s, where the darkness knob moves the [[thermostat]] in such a way as to change the temperature at which it opens and releases the cooked toast. Some similar controls produce similar inputs using different geometry; for example, the knob may be replaced by a lever which is moved through an angle. Another example is the sliding controls which frequently replace knobs as level controls in audio equipment.

==Feedback==
The use of knobs is an important aspect of the design of user interfaces in these devices. Particular attention needs to be paid to the feedback to the operator from the adjustments being made. The use of a pointer on the knob in conjunction with a scale assists in producing repeatable settings; in other cases there may be a [[dial (measurement)|dial]] or other indicator which is either mechanically linked the knob's rotation (as in many older radio [[tuner (radio)|tuners]]) or which reports the behavior being controlled.

==Origin and history==

Cookie jars, also known as biscuit barrels or jars, have been used in [[England]] since the latter part of the 18th century. They were often made of glass with metal lids. Cookie jars became popular in America around the time of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929. Early American cookie jars were made of glass with metal screw-on lids. In the 1930s, stoneware became predominant as the material for American cookie jars. Early cookie jars typically have simple cylindrical shapes and were often painted with floral or leaf decorations or emblazoned with colorful decals.

The Brush Pottery Company of [[Zanesville, Ohio]] is generally recognized as producing the first ceramic cookie jar.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The jar was green with the word "Cookies" embossed on the front. Most cookie jar manufacturers followed Brush's move to ceramics in the late 1930s, and designs became more innovative with figures, fruits, vegetables, animals, and other whimsical interpretations such as the Hull "Little Red Riding Hood" predominating. The golden period for American cookie jar production covers the years from 1940 until 1970, with several manufacturers rising to prominence.

==American cookie jar themes==
[[Image:Rocket01.JPG|thumb|right|A rocket ship from American Bisque, ca. 1960. Space themes were popular as the space race began in earnest during the late 1950s.]]

* Advertising ([[Coca-Cola]], [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg's]])
* Character (Mammy, Clown)
* Funny animal (Rabbit in Hat, Pink Poodle)
* Nursery rhyme/storybook ([[Cinderella]], Red Riding Hood)
* Holidays and seasons ([[Christmas]], [[Jack o' Lantern]], [[Snowman]])
* Cultural icons ([[Elvis Presley|Elvis]], [[Superman]], ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', [[Cookie Monster]])
* Everyday objects (House, Truck, Butter Churn)

==Andy Warhol==
Artist [[Andy Warhol]] amassed a collection of 175 ceramic cookie jars. These were in a multitude of shapes and figures. Most were purchased at [[flea market]]s. Warhol's collection was featured in a prominent news magazine and sparked an interest in collecting cookie jars. When asked in the 1970s why he pursued the 1930s and 1940s jars, Warhol said simply, "They are time pieces." At an [[auction]] of his apartment's contents in 1987, Warhol's collection of cookie jars realized $250,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=New York Magazine | publisher=New York Media, LLC | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gOMCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 | access-date=June 24, 2018 | page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Sometimes the phrase "''keep your hands out of the cookie jar''" is a way of telling someone to stay out of other people's business, even when doing so seems lucrative.
*In financial reporting, "cookie jar accounting" is the practice of increasing reserves during good years and eating them up during bad years. This process of income smoothing is totally ethical, but non-disclosure - especially to consistently reach performance targets - is illegal.
*In [[computer programming]], a "cookie jar" is an area of [[Memory (computers)|memory]] set aside for storing [[Magic cookie|cookies]].

The '''decibel watt''' or '''dBW''' is a unit for the measurement of the strength of a signal expressed in [[decibel]]s relative to one [[watt]]. It is used because of its capability to express both very large and very small values of power in a short range of number; e.g., 1&amp;nbsp;milliwatt = −30&amp;nbsp;dBW, 1&amp;nbsp;watt = 0&amp;nbsp;dBW, 10&amp;nbsp;watts = 10&amp;nbsp;dBW, 100&amp;nbsp;watts = 20&amp;nbsp;dBW, and 1,000,000&amp;nbsp;W = 60&amp;nbsp;dBW.

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Power in dBW} = 10 \log_{10}\frac{\mbox{Power}}{ 1 \mathrm{W}} &lt;/math&gt;

and also

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Power in W} = 10^{\frac{\mbox{Power in dBW}}{10}} &lt;/math&gt;

Compare dBW to [[dBm]], which is referenced to one milliwatt (0.001&amp;nbsp;W).

A given dBW value expressed in dBm is always 30 more because 1 watt is 1,000 milliwatts, and a ratio of 1,000 (in power) is 30&amp;nbsp;dB; e.g., 10&amp;nbsp;dBm (10&amp;nbsp;mW) is equal to −20&amp;nbsp;dBW (0.01&amp;nbsp;W).

Although the [[decibel]] (dB) is permitted for use alongside [[SI]] units, the dBW is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=E Ambler|last2=Taylor|first2=Barry N|date=2008|title=Guide for the use of the International System of Units (SI)|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.811e2008|journal=NIST Special Publication|volume=811|at=p. 30|doi=10.6028/nist.sp.811e2008|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Design leadership''' is a concept complementary to [[design management]]. In practice, design managers within companies often operate in the field of design leadership and design leaders in the field of design management. However, the two terms are not interchangeable, they are interdependent. {{ref|TR|1|}} In essence, and at the highest level, design leadership helps to define the future and design management provides key tools for getting there. Both are critically important to business, government and society, and both are necessary in order to maximise value from design activity and investment.

Design leadership can be described as leadership that generates innovative design solutions. Turner{{ref|TR|1|}} defines design leadership by adding three additional aspects for design leadership,
*the difference in leading through design,
*the sustaining design leadership over time and
*the gaining of acknowledgment for achievements through design.

Turner{{ref label|TR|1|a}} separates the core responsibilities of design leadership in following six activities:
*envisionising of the future
*manifesting strategic intent
*directing design investment
*managing corporate reputation
*creating and nurturing an environment of [[innovation]]
*training for design leadership

'''''Diesel''''' is a 1942 German [[biographical film]] directed by [[Gerhard Lamprecht]] and starring [[Willy Birgel]], [[Hilde Weissner]] and [[Paul Wegener]]. It portrays the life of [[Rudolf Diesel]], the German inventor of the [[diesel engine]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox p.100&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of a series of prestigious biopics made in Nazi Germany portraying genius inventors or artists struggling against the societies in which they live. The film was based on a biography by [[Eugen Diesel]], one of Diesel's children. 

It was shot at the [[Babelsberg Studios]] in [[Berlin]]. The film's sets were designed by art director [[Erich Kettelhut]]. The film was made on a large budget of 2,349,000 [[reichsmarks]], but was a popular box office success and was able to recoup its production costs.

A '''DIP reader''' (Document Insertion Processor) is an electronic device for reading an [[Magnetic stripe card|electronically encoded card]] that is inserted and then removed from the device.

A typical dip reader is used for reading credit cards where the [[data]] are either encoded on a magnetic stripe or an internal [[Integrated circuit|computer chip]]. The magnetic stripe on a card is typically read as the card is extracted.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} If the card is a [[smart card]], then the data transfer typically takes place when the card is fully inserted. In this case, the card is held while [[data transfer]] is taking place.

The '''e-Stewards''' Initiative is an electronics waste recycling standard created by the [[Basel Action Network]].

The program and the organization that created it grew out of the concern that electronic waste generated in wealthy countries was being dismantled in poor countries, often by underage workers. The young workers were being exposed to toxic metals and working in unsafe conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Recycling Electronic Wastes in Nigeria |url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/njihr/vol10/iss3/2 |journal=Northwestern Journal of International Human Rights |volume=10 |issue=3 |accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, BAN published the e-Stewards Standard for Responsible Recycling and Reuse of Electronic Equipment which set forth requirements for becoming a Certified e-Stewards Recycler—a program that "recognizes electronics recyclers that adhere to the most stringent environmentally and socially responsible practices when recovering hazardous electronic materials."&lt;ref name=rt&gt;{{cite news |title=Onsite Electronics Recycling earns e-Stewards certification |url=http://www.recyclingtoday.com/onsite-electronics-recycling-earns-e-stewards.aspx |accessdate=2 September 2011 |newspaper=Recycling Today |date=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recyclers that were qualified under the older Pledge program had until 1 September 2011 to achieve certification to the Standard by an e-Stewards Accredited Certification Body accredited by [[ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board (ANAB)|ANAB (ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board)]].

==Standard==
The e-Stewards Standard for Responsible Recycling and Reuse of Electronic Equipment was developed by the [[Basel Action Network]]. It is an industry-specific environmental management system standard that is the basis for the e-Stewards Initiative.   On 6 March 2012, BAN released and updated revised Version 2.0 to open public comment prior to its final adoption later in the spring of 2012.

The certification is available to all electronics recyclers and refurbishers. To achieve an e-Stewards certification organizations are subject to an initial Stage I and Stage II audit.  After passing such audits and being accepted by BAN, yearly surveillance audits take place to ensure organizations with the standard and have a registered [[ISO 14001]] environmental management system in place, as well as achieving numerous performance requirements including assuring no export of hazardous electronic wastes to developing countries, no use of prison labor and no dumping of toxic materials in municipal landfills.

'''Ground glass''' is [[glass]] whose surface has been ground to produce a flat but [[Gloss (material appearance)#Surface roughness|rough]] ([[Gloss (material appearance)|matte]]) finish, in which the glass is in small sharp fragments 

Ground glass surfaces have many applications, ranging from ornamentation on windows and [[List of glassware|table glassware]] to scientific uses in optics and [[laboratory glassware]].

==Uses==

===Photography===
In [[photography]], a sheet of ground glass is used for the manual [[focus (optics)|focusing]] in some [[camera|still]] and [[motion picture camera]]s, the ground-glass viewer is inserted in the back of the camera, and the lens opened to its widest [[aperture]]. This projects the scene on the ground glass upside down. The photographer focuses and composes using this projected image, sometimes with the aid of a [[magnifying glass]] (or [[loupe]]). In order to see the image better, a dark cloth is used to block out light, whence came the image of the old-time photographer with his head stuck under a large black cloth.

A ground glass is also used in the [[reflex finder]] of an [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] or [[Twin-lens reflex camera|TLR]] camera.

In motion picture cameras, the ground glass is a small, usually removable piece of transparent glass that sits between the [[rotary disc shutter]] and the viewfinder. The ground glass usually contains precise markings to show the camera operator the boundaries of the frame or the center [[reticle]], or any other important information. Because the ground glass is positioned between the mirror shutter and the viewfinder, it does not interfere with the image reaching the film and is therefore not recorded over the final image, but rather serves as a reference for the camera operator.

Ground glasses commonly serve as a framing reference for a desired [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]. Because most films shot with [[spherical lens]]es are shot full-frame and later masked during projection to a more [[widescreen]] aspect ratio, it is important not only for the operator to be able to see the boundaries of that aspect ratio, but also for the ground glass to be properly aligned in the camera so that the markings are an exact representation of the boundaries of the image recorded on film.

===Lighting===
Ground or [[frosted glass]] is widely used as a weather- and heat-proof [[diffuser (optics)|light diffuser]] in ambient [[lighting]], namely on glass covers or enclosures for lamp fixtures, and sometimes on [[incandescent bulb]]s. Its functions include reducing [[glare (vision)|glare]] and preventing [[retina]]l damage by direct sight of the lamp filament. This hides unsightly details of the lamp and fixture without [[attenuation|blocking]] its light, yielding a [[hard and soft light|softer]] illumination without giving hard [[shadow]]s.

===Chemistry===
Ground glass surfaces are often found on the glass equipment of [[chemistry|chemical]] [[laboratory|laboratories]].

Glass flasks, stoppers, valves, funnels, and tubing are often connected together by [[ground glass joint]]s, matching pairs of [[cone (geometry)|conical]] or [[sphere (geometry)|spherical]] surfaces that have been ground to a precise shape.

Flasks and [[test tube]]s often have a small ground-glass label area on the side. (Pencil writing on ground glass is largely inert, rub-proof and waterproof, but can be easily erased.)

===Technical optics===
An [[optical microscope]] may include a ground- or [[frosted glass|frosted-glass]] [[diffuser (optics)|diffuser]] to evenly illuminate the [[bright-field microscopy|field behind]] the specimen. [[Microscope slide]]s are often ground on the sides and [[bevel]]ed on the corners to soften the edges for safer handling.

==Poison==
Popular belief for many centuries is that ground-up glass (i.e., glass broken into tiny fragments) can kill if swallowed. In fact, this is a myth, as it is largely ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pain in the Glass|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/poison/glass.asp|work=Snopes|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kruszelnicki|first=Karl|title=Ground glass kills|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2007/01/18/1828923.htm|work=[[Dr Karl]]|publisher=ABC Science|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Guy de Maupassant]] short story "''La Confession''" concerns a jealous girl who poisons her older sister's suitor by inserting ground-up glass into cake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=de Maupassant|first=Guy|title=A Sister's Confession|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3090/3090-h/3090-h.htm#2H_4_0188|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Magnus B. Egerstedt puppet.jpg|thumb|right|[[Puppet Magnus]], a robot-manipulated marionette with complex control systems]]
The '''history of [[robot]]s''' has its origins in the [[ancient world]]. The modern concept began to be developed with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], which allowed the use of complex mechanics, and the subsequent introduction of electricity. This made it possible to power machines with small compact motors. In the early 20th century, the notion of a [[humanoid]] machine was developed. Today, one can envisage human-sized robots with the capacity for near-human thoughts and movement. 

The first uses of modern robots were in factories as [[industrial robot]]s – simple fixed machines capable of manufacturing tasks which allowed production with less need for human assistance. Digitally controlled [[industrial robot]]s and robots using [[artificial intelligence]] have been built since the 2000s.

==Early legends==
[[File:Vulcan Coustou Louvre MR1814.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Hephaestus]], Greek god of craftsmen.]]
[[File:Friar Bacon's Brazen Head.png|thumb|right|200px|An [[Elizabethan]] woodcut of a [[Brazen Head]] speaking: "Time is. Time was. Time is past."]]

Concepts of artificial servants and companions date at least as far back as the ancient legends of [[Cadmus]], who is said to have sown dragon teeth that turned into soldiers and [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]] whose statue of [[Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]] came to life. Many ancient mythologies included artificial people, such as the talking mechanical handmaidens built by the Greek god [[Hephaestus]] ([[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] to the Romans) out of gold,&lt;ref name="Gera"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=h5tKJvApybsC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=hephaestus+handmaidens|title=Ancient Greek Ideas on Speech, Language, and Civilization|author=Deborah Levine Gera|accessdate=31 December 2007|isbn=978-0-19-925616-7|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; the clay [[golem]]s of Jewish legend and clay giants of Norse legend. 

In [[Greek mythology]], [[Hephaestus]] created utilitarian three-legged tables that could move about under their own power, and a bronze man, [[Talos]], that defended [[Crete]]. Talos was eventually destroyed by [[Medea]] who cast a lightning bolt at his single vein of lead. To take the golden fleece Jason was also required to tame two fire-breathing bulls with bronze hooves; and like Cadmus he sowed the teeth of a dragon into soldiers.&lt;ref name="William Godwin 1876"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian ''Lokapannatti'' (11th/12th centuries{{Fix|text=CE?}}{{sfn|Strong|2007|p=133-134}}) tells the story of [[Ajatashatru|King Ajatashatru]] of [[Magadha]], who gathered the [[Buddha]]'s relics and hid them in an underground [[stupa]].{{sfn|Strong|2007|p=143}} The relics were protected by mechanical robots (bhuta vahana yanta), from the kingdom of Roma visaya, until they were disarmed by King [[Ashoka]].{{sfn|Strong|2007|p=133-134}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =Pali Literature | author = K.R.

Inspired by European [[Christian legend]] medieval Europeans devised [[brazen head]]s that could answer questions posed to them. [[Albertus Magnus]] was supposed to have constructed an entire android which could perform some domestic tasks, but it was destroyed by Albert's student [[Thomas Aquinas]] for disturbing his thought.&lt;ref name="William Godwin 1876"/&gt; The most famous legend concerned a bronze head devised by [[Roger Bacon]] which was destroyed or scrapped after he missed its moment of operation.&lt;ref name="William Godwin 1876"/&gt; Automata resembling humans or animals were popular in the imaginary worlds of medieval literature.&lt;ref&gt;Haug, "''Walewein'' as a postclassical literary experiment", pp. 23–4; ''Roman van Walewein'', ed.

==Automata==
{{Main|Automata}}
Mechanical automata were constructed in the [[10th century BC]] in the [[Western Zhou Dynasty]]. The artisan [[Yan Shi]] made humanoid automata that could sing and dance. The machine is said to have possessed lifelike organs, like [[bones]], [[muscles]] and [[joints]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robotics in Genitourinary Surgery|authors=Ashok K. Hemal &amp; Mani Menon|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783319206455|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cosmic Engine, a {{convert|10|m|adj=on}} clock tower built by [[Su Song]] in [[Kaifeng|Kaifeng, China]], in 1088, featured mechanical [[mannequin]]s that chimed the hours, ringing gongs or bells among other devices.&lt;ref name=suso1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenagain.info/WebChron/China/SongClock.html |title=Su Song's Clock: 1088 |accessdate=26 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html |title=Earliest Clocks |work=A Walk Through Time |accessdate=11 August 2008 |publisher=NIST Physics Laboratory |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531063139/http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html |archivedate=31 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fetes of automation continued into the [[Tang Dynasty]]. [[Daifeng Ma]] built a automated dresser servant for the queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robotics in Genitourinary Surgery|authors=Ashok K. Hemal &amp; Mani Menon|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783319206455|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ying Wenliang]] built a automata man that proposed [[toast]]s at [[banquets]] and a wooden woman automata that played the [[sheng (instrument)|sheng]]. Among the best documented automata of ancient China are that of [[Han Zhile]], a Japanese who moved to China in the early [[9th century BC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robotics in Genitourinary Surgery|authors=Ashok K. Hemal &amp; Mani Menon|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783319206455|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 4th century BC the mathematician [[Archytas]] of Tarentum postulated a mechanical bird he called "The Pigeon", which was propelled by [[steam]]. Yet another early [[automaton]] was the [[water clock|clepsydra]], made in 250 BC by [[Ctesibius]] of [[Alexandria]], a physicist and inventor from [[Ptolemaic Egypt]].&lt;ref name="RoboticHistory1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~currie/roboadam.htm |title=The History of Robotics |first=Adam |last=Currie |year=1999 |accessdate=10 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718024255/http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~currie/roboadam.htm |archivedate=18 July 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hero of Alexandria]] {{nowrap|(10–70 AD)}} made numerous innovations in the field of automata, including one that allegedly could speak. Taking up the earlier reference in [[Homer]]'s Iliad, [[Aristotle]] speculated in his ''Politics'' (ca. 322 BC, book 1, part 4) that automata could some day bring about human equality by making possible the [[abolitionism|abolition of slavery]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is only one condition in which we can imagine managers not needing subordinates, and masters not needing slaves. This condition would be that each instrument could do its own work, at the word of command or by intelligent anticipation, like the statues of Daedalus or the tripods made by Hephaestus, of which Homer relates that "Of their own motion they entered the conclave of Gods on Olympus", as if a shuttle should weave of itself, and a plectrum should do its own harp playing.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Al-jazari robots.jpg|200px|thumb|Al-Jazari's programmable humanoid robots.]]
[[Al-Jazari]] (1136–1206), a [[Muslim inventions|Muslim inventor]] during the [[Artuqid dynasty]], designed and constructed a number of automatic machines, including kitchen appliances and musical automata powered by water. One particularly complex automaton included four automatic musicians that floated on a lake.

Hero's works on automata were translated into Latin amid the [[12th century Renaissance]]. The early 13th-century artist-engineer [[Villard de Honnecourt]] sketched plans for several automata. At the end of the 13th century, [[Robert II, Count of Artois]], built a pleasure garden at his castle at [[Hesdin]] that incorporated a number of robots, humanoid and animal.&lt;ref name="The Garden of Earthly Delights: Mahaut of Artois and the Automata at Hesdin, Elly R.

Among the first verifiable automation is a humanoid drawn by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) in around 1495. Leonardo's notebooks, rediscovered in the 1950s, contain detailed drawings of a mechanical [[knight]] in armour which was able to sit up, wave its arms and move its head and jaw.&lt;ref name="RoboticHistory2"&gt;[http://robotics.megagiant.com/history.html A Brief History of Robotics], MegaGiant Robotics, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1533, [[Johannes Müller von Königsberg]] created an automaton eagle and fly made of iron; both could fly.

[[Image:Racknitz - The Turk 3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The secret interior of [[The Turk]].]]
The 17th century thinker [[Rene Descartes]] believed that animals and humans were biological machines. On his last trip to Norway, he took with him a mechanical doll that looked like his dead daughter Francine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robotics in Genitourinary Surgery|authors=Ashok K. Hemal &amp; Mani Menon|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783319206455|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century the master toy maker [[Jaques de Vaucanson]] built for [[Louis XV]] an automated duck with hundreds of moving parts, which could eat and drink. Vaucanson subsequently built humanoid automatons, a drummer and fife player were noted for their anatomical similarity to real human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robotics in Genitourinary Surgery|authors=Ashok K. Hemal &amp; Mani Menon|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783319206455|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaucanson's creation inspired European [[watchmaker]]s to manufacture mechanical automata and it became fashionable among the European aristocracy to collect sophisticated mechanical devices for entertainment. In the 1770s the Swiss [[Pierre Jaquet-Droz]] created moving automata that looked like children, which delighted [[Mary Shelly]], who went on to write ''[[Frankenstein: The Modern Prometheus]]''. The ultimate attempt at automation was [[The Turk]] by [[Wolfgang von Kempelen]], a sophisticated machine that could play [[chess]] against a human opponent and toured Europe. When the machine was brought to the new world, it prompted [[Edgar Allan Poe]] to pen an essay, in which he concluded that it was impossible for mechanical devices to reason or think.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robotics in Genitourinary Surgery|authors=Ashok K.

[[File:KarakuriBritishMuseum.jpg|thumb|200px|Tea-serving [[Karakuri ningyō|karakuri]], with mechanism, 19th century. [[Tokyo National Science Museum]].]]
The Japanese craftsman [[Hisashige Tanaka]], known as "Japan's Edison", created an array of extremely complex mechanical toys, some of which could serve tea, fire arrows drawn from a quiver, or even paint a Japanese ''[[kanji]]'' character. The landmark text ''[[Karakuri ningyō|Karakuri Zui]]'' (''Illustrated Machinery'') was published in 1796.&lt;ref name=Horn&gt;{{cite book|author=T. N.

===1900s===
In the book "[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]", robots were called "mechanical men". A notable character was the [[Tin Woodman]], a man made of tin who chopped trees in the forests of Oz.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===1910s===
In [[World War I]] remote control weapons were used, based on the work of [[Nikola Tesla]], who had constructed an electrical boat that could be remotely controlled by radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Killer Robots: Legality and Ethicality of Autonomous Weapons|author=Armin Krishnan|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781317109129|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1920s===
The term "robot" was first used in a play published by the Czech [[Karel Čapek]] in 1920. ''R.U.R.'' ([[Rossum's Universal Robots]]) was a satire, robots were manufactured biological beings that performed all unpleasant manual labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robotics in Genitourinary Surgery|authors=Ashok K. Hemal &amp; Mani Menon|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783319206455|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Čapek, the word was created by his brother [[Josef Capek|Josef]] from the Czech ''robota'', meaning servitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jerz.setonhill.edu/resources/RUR/index.html |title=R.U.R.

[[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] built Televox in 1926; it was a cardboard cutout connected to various devices which users could turn on and off.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} In 1927, [[Fritz Lang]]'s [[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]] was released; the [[Maschinenmensch]] ("machine-human"), a [[gynoid]] humanoid robot, also called "Parody", "Futura", "Robotrix", or the "Maria impersonator" (played by German actress [[Brigitte Helm]]), was the first robot ever to be depicted on film.&lt;ref name=MG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robotics.megagiant.com/history.html|title=MegaGiantRobotics|accessdate=26 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous Japanese robotic automata was presented to the public in 1927. The [[Gakutensoku]] was suppose to have a diplomatic role. Actuated by compressed air, it could write fluidly and raise its [[eyelids]]..&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robotics in Genitourinary Surgery|authors=Ashok K. Hemal &amp; Mani Menon|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783319206455|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many robots were constructed before the dawn of computer-controlled servomechanisms, for the public relations purposes of major firms. These were essentially machines that could perform a few stunts, like the automata of the 18th century. In 1928, one of the first humanoid robots was exhibited at the annual exhibition of the Model Engineers Society in London. Invented by W. H. Richards, the robot - named [[Eric (robot)|Eric]] - consisted of an [[aluminium]] [[body armour|suit of armour]] with eleven [[electromagnet]]s and one motor powered by a 12-volt power source. The robot could move its hands and head and could be controlled by remote control or voice control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reffell.org.uk/people/ericrobot.php|title=AH Reffell &amp; Eric Robot (1928)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s===
In 1939, the humanoid robot known as [[Elektro]] appeared at the [[World's Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freetimes.com/stories/13/35/robot-dreams-the-strange-tale-of-a-mans-quest-to-rebuild-his-mechanical-childhood-friend |work=The Cleveland Free Times |title=Robot Dreams : The Strange Tale Of A Man's Quest To Rebuild His Mechanical Childhood Friend |accessdate=2008-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121233050/http://www.freetimes.com/stories/13/35/robot-dreams-the-strange-tale-of-a-mans-quest-to-rebuild-his-mechanical-childhood-friend |archivedate=21 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Robots of Westinghouse: 1924-Today |author=Scott Schaut |publisher=Mansfield Memorial Museum |year=2006 |isbn=0-9785844-1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven feet tall (2.1 m) and weighing 265 pounds (120&amp;nbsp;kg), it could walk by voice command, speak about 700 words (using a 78-rpm [[record player]]), smoke cigarettes, blow up balloons, and move its head and arms. The body consisted of a steel gear cam and motor skeleton covered by an aluminium skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/features/science/20080515TDY20001.htm |title=Japan's first-ever robot |publisher=Yomiuri.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939 [[Konrad Zuse]] constructed the first [[Computer program|program]]mable electromechanical [[computer]], laying the foundation for the construction of a humanoid machine that is now deemed a robot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Killer Robots: Legality and Ethicality of Autonomous Weapons|author=Armin Krishnan|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781317109129|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1940s===

In 1941 and 1942, [[Isaac Asimov]] formulated the [[Three Laws of Robotics]], and in the process coined the word "robotics".{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In 1945 [[Vannevar Bush]] published [[As We May Think]], an essay that investigated the potential of [[electronic data processing]]. He predicted the rise of computers, digital word processors, [[Speech recognition|voice recognition]] and [[machine translation]]. He was later credited by [[Ted Nelson]], the inventor of [[hypertext]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robotics in Genitourinary Surgery|authors=Ashok K. Hemal &amp; Mani Menon|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783319206455|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, [[Norbert Wiener]] formulated the principles of [[cybernetics]], the basis of practical robotics.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The first electronic autonomous robots with complex behavior were created by [[William Grey Walter]] of the [[Burden Neurological Institute]] at Bristol, England in 1948 and 1949. He wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of [[neurons|brain cells]] could give rise to very complex [[behavior]]s - essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up. His first robots, named Elmer and Elsie, were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as "tortoises" due to their shape and slow rate of movement. The three-wheeled tortoise robots were capable of [[phototaxis]], by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Walter stressed the importance of using purely [[wiktionary:analogue|analogue]] electronics to [[simulate]] brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as [[Alan Turing]] and [[John von Neumann]] were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of [[digital data|digital]] [[computation]]. Walter's work inspired subsequent generations of robotics researchers such as [[Rodney Brooks]], [[Hans Moravec]] and [[Mark Tilden]].  Modern incarnations of Walter's "turtles" may be found in the form of [[BEAM robotics]].&lt;ref name="gwonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.uwe.ac.uk/Robots/gwonline/gwonline.html |title=The Grey Walter Online Archive |accessdate=2008-09-25 |author=Owen Holland |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009055230/http://www.ias.uwe.ac.uk/Robots/gwonline/gwonline.html |archivedate=9 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan robots became popular comic book characters. Robots became cultural icons and the Japanese government was spurred into funding research into [[robotics]]. Among the most iconic characters was the [[Astro Boy]], who is taught human feelings such as love, courage and self-doubt. Culturally, robots in Japan became regarded as helpmates to their human counterparts..&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robotics in Genitourinary Surgery|authors=Ashok K.

The Rancho Arm was developed as a robotic arm to help handicapped patients at the [[Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center|Rancho Los Amigos Hospital]] in [[Downey, California]]; this computer-controlled arm was bought by Stanford University in 1963.&lt;ref name=CH&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/?category=rai |title=Computer History Museum – Timeline of Computer History |accessdate=30 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 the first [[industrial robot]] was put to productive use in Japan. The Versatran robot had been developed by [[American Machine and Foundry]]. A year later a hydraulic robot design by [[Unimation]] was put into production by [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robotics in Genitourinary Surgery|authors=Ashok K. Hemal &amp; Mani Menon|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783319206455|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marvin Minsky]] created the Tentacle Arm in 1968; the arm was computer-controlled and its 12 joints were powered by hydraulics.&lt;ref name="CH" /&gt; In 1969 [[Mechanical Engineering]] student [[Victor Scheinman]] created the Stanford Arm, recognized as the first electronic computer-controlled robotic arm (Unimate's instructions were stored on a magnetic drum).&lt;ref name="CH" /&gt;

In the late-1960s the [[Vietnam War]] became the testing ground for automated command technology and sensor networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Killer Robots: Legality and Ethicality of Autonomous Weapons|author=Armin Krishnan|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781317109129|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 the [[McNamara Line]] was proposed with the aim of requiring virtually no ground forces.

In the early 1970s precision munitions and smart weapons were developed. Weapons became robotic by implementing [[terminal guidance]]. At the end of the Vietnam War the first laser-guided bombs were deployed, which could find their target by following a laser beam that was pointed at the target. During the 1972 [[Operation Linebacker]] laser-guided bombs proofed effective, but still depended heavily on human operators. [[Fire-and-forget]] weapons were also first deployed in the closing Vietnam War, once launched no further attention or action was required from the operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Killer Robots: Legality and Ethicality of Autonomous Weapons|author=Armin Krishnan|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781317109129|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of humanoid robots was advanced considerably by [[Japanese robotics]] scientists in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tQqVCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66 ''Robotics and Mechatronics: Proceedings of the 4th IFToMM International Symposium on Robotics and Mechatronics'', page 66]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Waseda University]] initiated the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the world's first full-scale humanoid intelligent robot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humanoid.waseda.ac.jp/booklet/kato_2-j.html&lt;/ref&gt; Its limb control system allowed it to walk with the lower limbs, and to grip and transport objects with hands, using tactile sensors. Its vision system allowed it to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors, artificial eyes and ears. And its conversation system allowed it to communicate with a person in Japanese, with an artificial mouth. This made it the first [[Android (robot)|android]].&lt;ref name="androidworld.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.androidworld.com/prod06.htm|title=Historical Android Projects|work=androidworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PqQeAQAAIAAJ ''Robots: From Science Fiction to Technological Revolution''], page 130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NgLLBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=SA3-PA1 ''Handbook of Digital Human Modeling: Research for Applied Ergonomics and Human Factors Engineering'', Chapter 3, pages 1-2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freddy II|Freddy]] and [[Freddy II]] were robots built at the [[University of Edinburgh School of Informatics]] by [[Pat Ambler]], [[Robin Popplestone]], [[Austin Tate]], and [[Donald Mitchie]], and were capable of assembling wooden blocks in a period of several hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/project/freddy/ |title=Edinburgh Freddy Robot |accessdate=31 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; German based company [[KUKA]] built the world's first industrial robot with six electromechanically driven axes, known as FAMULUS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kuka.com/en/company/group/milestones/1973.htm |title=first industrial robot with six electromechanically driven axes KUKA's FAMULUS |accessdate=17 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''home server''' is a [[Server (computing)|computing server]] located in a [[private residence]] providing services to other devices inside or outside the [[household]] through a [[home network]] or the [[Internet]]. Such services may include [[shared resource|file and printer serving]], [[Home theater PC|media center]] serving, [[web server|web serving]] (on the network or Internet), [[web caching]], file sharing and synchronization, [[Online calendar|calendar]] and contact sharing and synchronization, account authentication and [[backup]] services.

Because of the relatively low number of computers on a typical home network, a home server commonly does not require significant computing power. Home servers can be implemented do-it-yourself style with a re-purposed, older computer, or a [[plug computer]]; pre-configured commercial home server appliances are also available. An [[uninterruptible power supply]] is sometimes used in case of [[power outage]]s that can possibly corrupt data.

==Services provided by home servers==

===Administration and configuration===
Home servers often run [[headless server|headless]], and can be administered remotely through a [[command shell]], or graphically through a [[remote desktop]] system such as [[Remote Desktop Protocol|RDP]], [[Virtual Network Computing|VNC]], [[Webmin]], [[Apple Remote Desktop]], or many others.

Some home server operating systems (such as [[Windows Home Server]]) include a consumer-focused [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) for setup and configuration that is available on home computers on the home network (and remotely over the [[Internet]] via [[#RA|remote access]]). Others simply enable users to use native operating system tools for configuration.

===Centralized storage===
Home servers often act as [[network-attached storage]] (NAS) providing the major benefit that all users' files can be centrally and securely stored, with flexible permissions applied to them. Such files can be easily accessed from any other system on the network, provided the correct credentials are supplied. This also applies to shared printers.

Such files can also be shared over the Internet to be accessible from anywhere in the world using [[#RA|remote access]].

Servers running [[Unix]] or [[Linux]] with the free [[Samba (software)|Samba suite]] (or certain Windows Server products - Windows Home Server excluded) can provide domain control, custom logon scripts, and [[roaming user profile|roaming profiles]] to users of certain versions of Windows{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. This allows a user to log on from any machine in the domain and have access to her or his "My Documents" and personalized Windows and application preferences - multiple accounts on each computer in the home are not needed.

===Media serving===
Home servers are often used to serve multi-media content, including photos, music, and video to other devices in the household (and even to the Internet; see [[Space shifting]], [[Tonido]] and [[Orb (Software)|Orb]]). Using standard protocols such as [[Digital Living Network Alliance|DLNA]] or proprietary systems such as [[iTunes]], users can access their media stored on the home server from any room in the house. [[Windows XP Media Center Edition]], [[Windows Vista]], and [[Windows 7]] can act as a home server, supporting a particular type of media serving that streams the interactive user experience to [[Windows Media Center Extender|Media Center Extenders]] including the [[Xbox 360]].
[[Image:MythTV-main menu.png|right|thumb|150px|A typical MythTV menu.]]

[[Windows Home Server]] supports media streaming to [[Xbox 360]] and other DLNA-based media receivers via the built-in [[Windows Media Connect]] technology.  Some Windows Home Server device manufacturers, such as [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], extend this functionality with a full DLNA implementation such as [[PacketVideo]] [[TwonkyMedia server|TwonkyMedia]] server.

There are many open-source and fully functional programs for media serving available for Linux. [[LinuxMCE]] is one example, which allows other devices to boot off a hard drive image on the server, allowing them to become appliances such as [[set-top box]]es. [[Asterisk (PBX)|Asterisk]], Xine, [[MythTV]] (another media serving solution), [[VideoLAN]], [[SlimServer]], DLNA, and many other open-source projects are fully integrated for a seamless home theater/automation/telephony experience.

On an [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Macintosh]] server, options include [[iTunes]], [[PS3 Media Server]], and [[Elgato#EyeConnect|Elgato]]. Additionally, for Macs directly connected to TVs, [[Boxee]] can act as a full-featured media center interface.

Servers are typically always on so the addition of a TV or radio tuner allows recording to be scheduled at any time.

Some home servers provide [[#RA|remote access]] to media and entertainment content.

===Remote access {{Anchor|RA}}===
[[Image:Webmin1dot290.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The Webmin Interface as it would appear in a standard web browser.]]
A home server can be used to provide remote access into the home from devices on the Internet, using [[remote desktop software]] and other [[remote administration]] software. For example, [[Windows Home Server]] provides remote access to files stored on the home server via a web interface as well as remote access to [[Terminal Services|Remote Desktop]] sessions on PCs in the house. Similarly, [[Tonido]] provides direct access via a web browser from the Internet without requiring any port forwarding or other setup. Some enthusiasts often use [[Virtual private network|VPN]] technologies as well.

On a Linux server, two popular tools are (among many) [[Virtual Network Computing|VNC]] and [[Webmin]]. VNC allows clients to remotely view a server [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] desktop as if the user was physically sitting in front of the server. A GUI need not be running on the server console for this to occur; there can be multiple 'virtual' desktop environments open at the same time. Webmin allows users to control many aspects of server configuration and maintenance all from a simple web interface. Both can be configured to be accessed from anywhere on the [[Internet]].

Servers can also be accessed remotely using the command line-based [[Telnet]] and [[Secure Shell|SSH]] protocols.

===Web serving===
Some users choose to run a [[web server]] in order to share files easily and publicly (or privately, on the home network). Others set up web pages and serve them straight from their home, although this may be in violation of some [[Internet service provider|ISP]]s terms of service. Sometimes these web servers are run on a nonstandard port in order to avoid the ISP's port blocking. Example web servers used on home servers include [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] and [[Internet Information Services|IIS]].

Many other web servers are available; see [[Comparison of lightweight web servers]], [[Comparison of web servers]].

====Web proxy====
Some networks have an [[HTTP proxy]] which can be used to speed up web access when multiple users visit the same websites, and to get past blocking software while the owner is using the network of some institution that might block certain sites. Public proxies are often slow and unreliable and so it is worth the trouble of setting up one's own private proxy.

Some proxies can be configured to block websites on the local network if it is set up as a [[transparent proxy]].

===E-mail===
Many home servers also run e-mail servers that handle e-mail for the owner's domain name. The advantages are having much bigger mailboxes and maximum message size than most commercial e-mail services. Access to the server, since it is on the local network is much faster than using an external service. This also increases security as e-mails do not reside on an off-site server.

===BitTorrent===
Home servers are ideal for utilizing the [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] protocol for downloading and seeding files as some torrents can take days, or even weeks to complete and perform better on an uninterrupted connection. There are many text based clients such as [[rTorrent]] and web-based ones such as [[TorrentFlux]] and [[Tonido]] available for this purpose. BitTorrent also makes it easier for those with limited bandwidth to distribute large files over the Internet.

===Gopher===
An unusual service is the [[Gopher protocol]], a hypertext document retrieval protocol which pre-dated the [[World Wide Web]] and was popular in the early 1990s. Many of the remaining gopher servers are run off home servers utilizing [[PyGopherd]] and the [[Bucktooth]] gopher server.

===Home automation===
[[Home automation]] requires a device in the home that is available 24/7. Often such home automation controllers are run on a home server.

===Security monitoring===
Relatively low cost [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] solutions are available that allow recording of video cameras to a home server for security purposes. The video can then be viewed on PCs or other devices in the house.

A series of cheap [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]]-based [[webcam]]s can be connected to a home server as a makeshift CCTV system. Optionally these images and video streams can be made available over the Internet using standard protocols.

===Family applications===
Home servers can act as a host to family-oriented applications such as a family calendar, to-do lists, and message boards.

===IRC and instant messaging===
Because a server is always on, an IRC client or IM client running on it will be highly available to the Internet. This way, the chat client will be able to record activity that occurs even while the user is not at the computer, e.g. asleep or at work or school. Textual clients such as [[Irssi]] and [[tmsnc]] can be detached using [[GNU Screen]] for example, and graphical clients such as [[Pidgin]] can be detached using [[xmove]]. [[Quassel]] provides a specific version for this kind of use. Home servers can also be used to run personal [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] servers and [[IRC server]]s as these protocols can support a large number of users on very little bandwidth.

===Online gaming===
Some multiplayer games such as [[Continuum (game client)|Continuum]], [[Tremulous]], [[Minecraft]], and [[Doom (game)|Doom]] have server software available which users may download and use to run their own private [[game server]]. Some of these servers are [[password]] protected, so only a selected group of people such as [[Clan (computer gaming)|clan]] members or whitelisted players can gain access to the server. Others are open for public use and may move to [[colocation centre|colocation]] or other forms of paid hosting if they gain a large number of players.

=== Federated social networks ===
Home servers can be used to host distributed [[Federated social network|federated social networks]] like [[DIASPORA*|diaspora]]* and [[GNU social|GNU Social]]. Federation protocols like [[ActivityPub]] allow lots of small home servers to interact in a meaningful way and give the perception of being on a large traditional social network. Federation is not just limited to social networks. Many innovative new free software web services are being developed that can allow people to host their own videos, photos, blogs etc. and still participate in the larger federated networks.

===Third-party platform===
Home servers often are platforms that enable third-party products to be built and added over time. For example, [[Windows Home Server]] provides a Software Development Kit.&lt;ref&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb425866.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Tonido]] provides an application platform that can be extended by writing new applications using their SDK.

==Operating systems==
Home servers run many different [[operating system]]s. Enthusiasts who build their own home servers can use whatever OS is conveniently available or familiar to them, such as [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] or [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs]].

==Hardware==
[[Single-board computer]]s are increasingly being used to power home servers, with many of them being [[ARM architecture|ARM]] devices. Old desktop and laptop computers can also be re-purposed to be used as home servers.

Mobile phones are typically just as powerful as ARM-based single board computers. Once mobile phones can run the [[GNU/Linux]] operating system, self-hosting might move to mobile devices with each person's data and services being served from their own mobile phone.

The '''Department für Agrobiotechnology''' (IFA-Tulln) is one of the 15 departments of the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna (BOKU) operated in cooperation with the [[Vienna University of Technology]] and the [[University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna]] at the Campus Tulln Technopol.

== History ==
The IFA-Tulln was founded in 1994 as a joint research institution of three major universities in Vienna, the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna (VetMed), the [[Vienna University of Technology]] (TUW) and the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU). The idea has been to enable the collaboration of scientists with complementary background in the interdisciplinary area of agrobiotechnology under one roof. Their expertise covers modern biotechnology in plant and animal production, [[environmental biotechnology]], [[animal nutrition]], food- and feed science and (bio) analytics and [[biopolymers]]. Today about 150 BOKU employees, guest scientists and students are working in 6 institutes at the IFA-Tulln which has become a department of the BOKU in 2004.

== Organisation ==
IFA-Tulln, which is a department of the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU), was founded in 1994 as a joint research institution of the BOKU, the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna and the Vienna University of Technology to enable the collaboration of scientists with complementary background in the interdisciplinary area of agrobiotechnology.

The department is organised into 6 institutes:
* Institute for Biotechnology in Plant Production
* Institute for Natural Materials Technology
* Center for Analytical Chemistry
* Institute for Environmental Biotechnology
* Institute for Biotechnology in Animal Production
* Institute of Animal Nutrition, Products and Nutrition Physiology

== Location ==
The first 5 Institutes of the department IFA-Tulln are located in the IFA-Tulln building in [[Tulln an der Donau]] on the Campus Tulln Technopol. The sixth Institute (Institute of Animal Nutrition, Products and Nutrition Physiology) is located in Muthgasse, Vienna. The IFA-Tulln building, together with the other working groups of BOKU in the UFT-building (University Research Center Tulln), is forming the “BOKU location Tulln”. Campus Tulln Technopol is part of Technopol Tulln which was founded in 2006 by Ecoplus. Further partners of Technopol Tulln besides BOKU, are: AIT Austrian Institute of Technology, Technopark Tulln GmbH, Technologiezentrum Tulln GmbH, ''[[Agrana#Agrana Research &amp; Innovation Center|Agrana Research &amp; Innovation Center]]'', University for Applied Sciences Wiener Neustadt Campus Tulln and the city of Tulln.

== Institutes at the Department IFA-Tulln ==
=== Institute for Biotechnology in Plant Production ===
In its research, the Institute for Biotechnology in Plant Production focuses on basic and applied research in the areas plant breeding, plant genetics and phytopathology. The logical overlaps between these topics are plant-pathogen interaction, genetics of disease resistance and breeding research for disease resistance. The institute almost exclusively performs its own research work on agricultural crop plants.

=== Institute for Natural Materials Technology ===
The research focuses on the utilization of natural resources as well as of idle waste material for reinforcements of polymers or for use as thermoplastic matrices. The main processing technologies used in composites- production are extrusion and injection moulding. To a lesser content the Institute also applies compression moulding.

=== Center for Analytical Chemistry ===
The Center for Analytical Chemistry (CAC) is aiming to perform cutting edge scientific research and to develop advanced methods in the field of (bio)analytical chemistry. The CAC with its two Christian Doppler Laboratories is pursuing a highly interdisciplinary approach for the determination of chemical contaminants including mycotoxins and allergenic proteins in food. By employing metabolomics based approaches the CAC studies entire biological systems with a special emphasis on plant-fungi interactions.

There are five research groups within the Institute: 
* Metabolomics and Bioactive Substances
* Mycotoxins and Mycotoxin Metabolism
* Immunoanalytics and Food Allergens
* Water Analysis and Quality Assurance Systems
* Molecular Diagnostics

=== Institute for Environmental Biotechnology ===
Focus of research activities at the Institute for Environmental Biotechnology is given to the application of microbial metabolism to safeguard the quality of life and preserve natural resources. On the one hand, emphasis is put on degradation or detoxification of pollutants (in soil, water and waste) or the development of monitoring methods to evaluate the success of restoration technologies. On the other hand, the best possible utilization of existing resources by establishment of sustainable material cycles is the central aim of research conducted. 
Practical application and process development for technical implementation are a primary concern independent from fundamental investigation of the underlying microbiological activities. Examples are the scale up of fermentation processes, the development of technical remediation methods and the testing of innovative combined biological-physical processes (e.g. use of membrane bioprocesses) in environmental technology.

There are 6 research groups established at the Institute for Environmental Biotechnology:
* Anaerobic digestion (biogas)
* Contaminated land management
* Feed additives
* Fermentation and pilot plant
* Microbiology (incl. molecular biology) and
* Water and wastewater treatment

=== Institute for Biotechnology in Animal Production ===
With respect to methodological and research competence at the department IFA Tulln the institute for Biotechnology in Animal Production concentrates on advanced tissue culture technologies for the in vitro production of embryos.There are three research groups at the Institute for Biotechnology in Animal Production
* Proteomics of Gametes Maternal Interaction
* Genetics of mtDNA
* In vitro Production of Embryos

=== Institute of Animal Nutrition, Products and Nutrition Physiology ===
The Institute of Animal Nutrition, Products, and Nutrition Physiology (APN) represents the start of the supply chain of food of animal origin. It focuses on adequate feeding of agricultural livestock and the significant impact of animal nutrition on quality and safety of primary products, such as milk, meat and eggs. Aside from nutrients, special emphasis is paid on secondary effects of feed and feed/food components on digestion, metabolism and health.

The Institute has condensed its mission and structure towards three intrinsic topics: 
* animal nutrition
* animal products
* nutrition physiology

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1224">'''Import replacement''' refers to an urban free market economic process of entrepreneurs replacing the imports of the city with production from within the city. 

The idea was invented by [[Jane Jacobs]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacobs |first=Jane |date=1985 |title=Cities and the Wealth of Nations |location= New York, NY |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-0394729114}}&lt;/ref&gt; who spun off from the idea of [[import substitution]] developed by [[Andre Gunder Frank]] and widely discussed during the first and second [[Latin American debt crisis]]. Import substitution is a national economic theory implying that if a nation substituted its imports with national production the nation would become wealthier, whereas Jacob's idea is entirely about cities and could be called ''urban import substitution''. However, even this would lead to confusion since, in practice, import substitution in India and Latin America were government subsidized and mandated, whereas Jacobs' concept of import replacement is a free market process of discovery and [[division of labor]] within a city.

'''In-car entertainment''' ('''ICE'''), or '''in-vehicle [[infotainment]]''' ('''IVI'''), is a collection of hardware and software in automobiles that provides audio or video entertainment. In car entertainment originated with [[car audio]] systems that consisted of radios and cassette or CD players, and now includes [[automotive navigation system]]s, video players, USB and Bluetooth connectivity, [[Carputers]], [[in-car internet]], and WiFi. Once controlled by simple dashboards knobs and dials, ICE systems can include [[steering wheel audio control]]s and [[handsfree]] voice control.

== Background ==
Driven by the demand for more connected vehicles, in-car entertainment is getting more and more sophisticated. [[Automotive industry|Car makers]], [[List of car audio manufacturers and brands|electronics and software suppliers]], as well as newcomers from the [[Silicon Valley]] (such as [[Google]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]), work together and also compete to come up with infotainment systems that are user-friendly and safe to use. ICE systems are increasingly commonplace with newer vehicle models and several auto makers have developed their own systems: [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] with [[Ford Sync|SYNC]] and [[MyFord Touch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/I/in-vehicle-infotainment-ivi.html|title=What is In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI)? Webopedia Definition|website=www.webopedia.com|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toyota]] with [[Toyota Entune|Entune]], [[Cadillac]] with [http://www.cadillac.com/cadillac-cue.html CUE] (Cadillac User Experience), [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles|FCA]] with [http://www.driveuconnect.com/ Uconnect], etc.

With the [[Smartphone#Smartphone usage|mass adoption of smartphones]] worldwide, a new issue has emerged: the use of connected devices in the car. According to a 2015 survey conducted by [[AT&amp;T]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/70-percent-of-us-use-our-phones-while-driving/|title=70 percent of drivers use their smartphones while on the road|date=2015-05-19|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/smartphone-use-while-driving-grows-beyond-texting--to-social-media-web-surfing-selfies-video-chatting-300085207.html|title=Smartphone Use While Driving Grows Beyond Texting  to Social Media, Web Surfing, Selfies, Video Chatting|last=Inc.|first=AT&amp;amp;T|website=www.prnewswire.com|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a sample of over 2,000 US respondents, "7-in-10 people engage in smartphone activities while driving" including [[social media]] (40%), [[Web navigation|web browsing]] (30%) and even [[video chat]]ting (10%). This raises safety concerns related to [[distracted driving]] and also pushes the automotive industry to integrate those devices in a safe manner. "Traditional" car makers increasingly rely on the software and electronics expertise of auto suppliers and [[Technology company|technology companies]] to help them design such systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/dce10162-b5f1-11e4-a577-00144feab7de.html#axzz4DoCxxfo0|title=Software is steering auto industry|last=Gapper|first=John|date=2015-02-18|newspaper=Financial Times|issn=0307-1766|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google and Apple's mobile OSs' [[Mobile operating system#Market Share by Country or Region|making the bulk of the market]], the two tech companies have developed projection modes ([[Android Auto]], [[CarPlay|Apple CarPlay]]) to enable mobile devices to be operated in vehicles through the dashboard head unit so that the vehicle occupants don't manipulate their devices directly, use an interface they are familiar with, and spend more time with their eyes on the road.

==Safety concerns==
{{further|Distracted driving}}
Policies regarding in-car entertainment systems are less developed than [[Restrictions on cell phone use by US drivers|cell phone usage laws]] regarding similar distractions in cars. In the United States, 10 states, D.C., Guam, and the Virgin Islands prohibit all drivers from using handheld cell phones while driving. Additionally, 39 states, D.C., Guam, and the Virgin Islands ban text messaging for all drivers. However, few states have developed laws to limit the content that drivers can view on in-car entertainment systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghsa.org/html/stateinfo/laws/cellphone_laws.html|title=Cellphone Laws|work=GHSA.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, researchers are beginning to analyze the potential impact of distracted drivers on the roads. Charlie Klauer, a researcher at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, says that drivers who look at screens have a much higher risk of crashing. Furthermore, the risk of crashing rises exponentially the longer a driver has taken their eyes off the road.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/technology/07distracted.html?_r=0&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1351646541-gzRDi1qWkEBPLSvFYy+70A|title=Distracted|date=2010-01-07|publisher=[[NY Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automotive companies like Ford and Audi contend that they have tested and revised their latest systems in order to reduce the amount of time that drivers spend looking away from the road.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

==Security concerns==
As car infotainment systems can access more and more functions of the vehicle (e.g. through the [[CAN bus]]), concerns have also been voiced about potential remote car hacking&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/03/fbi-warns-car-hacking-real-risk/|title=The FBI Warns That Car Hacking Is a Real Risk|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/definition/car-hacking|title=What is car hacking? - Definition from WhatIs.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[drive by wire]]).

===Signal Extraction Technology (SET) pulse oximetry===
[[Image:MasimoSet graph.jpg|thumbnail|right|True and false SpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; alarm rate of Masimo SET versus 19 competing [[pulse oximetry]] technologies.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;]]
[[File:Radical-7.jpg|thumb|The Masimo Radical-7 is a pulse oximeter that can also noninvasively measure a patient's [[hemoglobin]] and respiration rate.]]
[[Image:Masimo Rainbow FingerSensor.jpg|thumbnail|right|Masimo SET [[adhesive]] [[sensors]] monitor oxygenation, [[pulse rate]] and "special rainbow" [[sensors]] allow additional measurement of noninvasive blood constituents.]]
[[Pulse oximetry]] uses two [[light emitting diodes]] (LEDs), one red and one infrared, to measure the absorption of light and translates that into the percentage of [[hemoglobin]] molecules that are bound with oxygen, which is called [[arterial]] [[oxygen saturation]] (SpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Conventional [[pulse oximetry]] assumes that [[arterial]] blood is the only blood moving (pulsating) in the measurement site. However, during patient motion, the [[venous]] blood also moves, which can cause conventional [[pulse oximetry]] to under-read SpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels because it cannot distinguish between the [[arterial]] and [[venous]] blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=2148612 |first1=G |last1=Mardirossian |first2=RE |last2=Schneider |year=1992|title=Limitations of pulse oximetry |journal=Anesth Prog |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=194–6 |pmid=8250340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3323062 |year=1987 |last1=Barker |first1=SJ |last2=Tremper |first2=KK |title=Pulse oximetry: Applications and limitations |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=155–75 |journal=Int Anesthesiol Clin |doi=10.1097/00004311-198702530-00010}}&lt;/ref&gt; SET identifies the [[venous]] blood signal (which has a lower [[oxygen saturation]] level than [[arterial]] blood), isolates it, and uses adaptive filters to cancel the noise and extract the [[arterial]] signal in order to report accurate SpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [[pulse rate]].  In addition, SET [[pulse oximetry]] provides [[perfusion]] index (PI) and pleth variability index (PVI). Multiple studies have shown that compared to non-SET pulse oximeters, SET increases the ability to detect life-threatening events and reduces false alarms during challenging conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10825316 |year=2000 |last1=Malviya |first1=S |last2=Reynolds |first2=PI |last3=Voepel-Lewis |first3=T |last4=Siewert |first4=M |last5=Watson |first5=D |last6=Tait |first6=AR |last7=Tremper |first7=K |title=False alarms and sensitivity of conventional [[pulse oximetry]] versus the SET technology in the pediatric postanesthesia care unit |journal=Anesth Analg |volume=90 |issue=6 |pages=1336–40 |doi=10.1097/00000539-200006000-00013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Barker |first1=SJ |year=2002|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=barker%202002%20pulse%20oximetry%20masimo |title="Motion-resistant" pulse oximetry: a comparison of old and new models |journal=Anesth Analg |volume=95 |issue=4 |pages=967–72 |pmid=12351278 |doi=10.1213/00000539-200210000-00033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional studies have also shown the impact of SET on patient outcomes, such as helping clinicians:

In 2011, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] and the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] recommended mandatory screening for all newborns, using "motion-tolerant pulse oximeters that report functional [[oxygen saturation]] have been validated in low [[perfusion]] conditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3310/hta16020

In 2012, Masimo received [[FDA]] 510(k) clearance for devices and [[sensors]] with labeling for screening newborns for CCHD. It marked the first time the [[FDA]] cleared specific labeling indicating the use of pulse oximeters, in conjunction with a [[physical examination]], to screen newborns for CCHD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Masimo oximeters and neonatal sensors receive FDA 510(k) clearance with labeling for use in newborn screening for Critical Congenital Heart Disease (CCHD) |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/masimo-oximeters-and-neonatal-sensors-receive-fda-510k-clearance-with-labeling-for-use-in-newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-cchd-170962421.html |publisher=PRNewswire.com |date=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, Masimo announced CE Mark of Oxygen Reserve Index or ORi, the company’s 11th noninvasive parameter, which provides real-time visibility to oxygenation status. ORi is intended to supplement, not replace, [[oxygen saturation]] (SpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) monitoring and [[partial pressure of oxygen]] (PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) measurements. ORi can be trended and has optional alarms to notify clinicians of changes in a patient’s oxygen reserve, and may enable proactive interventions to avoid [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and unintended [[hyperoxia]].

A mechanical filter made by the Kokusai Electric Company intended for selecting the narrow {{nowrap|2 kHz}} bandwidth signals in [[single-sideband modulation|SSB]] radio receivers.  It operates at {{nowrap|455 kHz}}, a common [[intermediate frequency|IF]] for these receivers, and is dimensioned {{nowrap|45×15×15 mm}} ({{nowrap|{{frac|1|3|4}}×{{frac|7|12}}×{{frac|7|12}} in}}).]]
A '''mechanical filter''' is a [[filter (signal processing)|signal processing filter]] usually used in place of an [[electronic filter]] at [[radio frequency|radio frequencies]].  Its purpose is the same as that of a normal electronic filter: to pass a range of signal frequencies, but to block others.  The filter acts on mechanical vibrations which are the analogue of the electrical signal.  At the input and output of the filter, [[transducer]]s convert the electrical signal into, and then back from, these mechanical vibrations.

The components of a mechanical filter are all directly analogous to the various elements found in electrical circuits.  The mechanical elements obey mathematical functions which are identical to their corresponding electrical elements.  This makes it possible to apply electrical network analysis and filter design methods to mechanical filters.  Electrical theory has developed a large library of mathematical forms that produce useful filter [[linear filter#Frequency response|frequency responses]] and the mechanical filter designer is able to make direct use of these.  It is only necessary to set the mechanical components to appropriate values to produce a filter with an identical response to the electrical counterpart.

[[Steel alloy]]s and [[iron–nickel alloy]]s are common materials for mechanical filter components; nickel is sometimes used for the input and output couplings.  Resonators in the filter made from these materials need to be machined to precisely adjust their [[resonance frequency]] before final assembly.

While the meaning of ''mechanical filter'' in this article is one that is used in an [[electromechanics|electromechanical]] role, it is possible to use a mechanical design to filter mechanical vibrations or sound waves (which are also essentially mechanical) directly. For example, filtering of audio frequency response in the design of [[loudspeaker enclosure|loudspeaker cabinets]] can be achieved with mechanical components.  In the electrical application, in addition to mechanical components which correspond to their electrical counterparts, transducers are needed to convert between the mechanical and electrical domains.  A representative selection of the wide variety of component forms and topologies for mechanical filters are presented in this article.

The theory of mechanical filters was first applied to improving the mechanical parts of [[phonograph]]s in the 1920s.  By the 1950s mechanical filters were being manufactured as self-contained components for applications in radio transmitters and high-end receivers.  The high "quality factor", ''[[Q factor|Q]]'', that mechanical resonators can attain, far higher than that of an all-electrical [[RLC circuit#Q factor|LC circuit]], made possible the construction of mechanical filters with excellent [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]]. Good selectivity, being important in radio receivers, made such filters highly attractive.  Contemporary researchers are working on microelectromechanical filters, the mechanical devices corresponding to electronic integrated circuits.

==Elements==
[[File:Filterbaustein MF200 1 800 293.jpg|thumb|right|Mechanical filter from a telephone carrier system using torsional resonator elements]]
The elements of a [[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] linear electrical network consist of [[inductor]]s, [[capacitor]]s and [[resistor]]s which have the properties of [[inductance]], elastance (inverse [[capacitance]]) and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, [[mass]], [[stiffness]] and [[damping]]. In most electronic filter designs, only inductor and capacitor elements are used in the body of the filter (although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the input and output). Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted [[parasitic element (electrical networks)|parasitic element]]s. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness, but in reality some damping is present as well.&lt;ref name="Darlington, p.7"&gt;Darlington, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanical counterparts of [[voltage]] and [[electric current]] in this type of analysis are, respectively, [[force]] (''F'') and [[velocity]] (''v'') and represent the signal waveforms. From this, a [[mechanical impedance]] can be defined in terms of the imaginary [[angular frequency]], ''jω'', which entirely follows the electrical analogy.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, pp.1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talbot-Smith, pp.1.85,1.86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notes:
*The symbols ''x'', ''t'', and ''a'' represent their usual quantities; distance, time, and acceleration respectively.
*The mechanical quantity ''compliance'', which is the inverse of stiffness, can be used instead of stiffness to give a more direct correspondence to capacitance, but stiffness is used in the table as the more familiar quantity.&lt;/div&gt;

The scheme presented in the table is known as the [[impedance analogy]]. Circuit diagrams produced using this analogy match the electrical impedance of the mechanical system seen by the electrical circuit, making it intuitive from an electrical engineering standpoint. There is also the [[mobility analogy]],&lt;ref group=n&gt;The impedance analogy is the more common approach,(Gatti &amp; Ferrari, pp.630–632) but amongst those using the mobility analogy is [[Rockwell Collins]] Inc, a principal manufacturer of mechanical filters. (Johnson, 1968, p.41)&lt;/ref&gt; in which force corresponds to current and velocity corresponds to voltage. This has equally valid results but requires using the reciprocals of the electrical counterparts listed above. Hence, ''M'' → ''C'', ''S'' → 1/''L'', ''D'' → ''G'' where ''G'' is [[electrical conductance]], the inverse of resistance. Equivalent circuits produced by this scheme are similar, but are the [[dual impedance]] forms whereby series elements become parallel, capacitors become inductors, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Huang, pp.378–379&lt;/ref&gt; Circuit diagrams using the mobility analogy more closely match the mechanical [[Topology (electronics)|arrangement]] of the circuit, making it more intuitive from a mechanical engineering standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Eargle, pp.4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their application to electromechanical systems, these analogies are widely used to aid analysis in acoustics.&lt;ref&gt;Talbot-Smith, pp.1.86–1.98, for instance.&lt;/ref&gt;

Any mechanical component will unavoidably possess both mass and stiffness. This translates in electrical terms to an LC circuit, that is, a circuit consisting of an inductor and a capacitor, hence mechanical components are resonators and are often used as such. It is still possible to represent inductors and capacitors as individual lumped elements in a mechanical implementation by minimising (but never quite eliminating) the unwanted property. Capacitors may be made of thin, long rods, that is, the mass is minimised and the compliance is maximised. Inductors, on the other hand, may be made of short, wide pieces which maximise the mass in comparison to the compliance of the piece.&lt;ref name=Norton1&gt;Norton, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanical parts act as a [[transmission line]] for mechanical vibrations. If the [[wavelength]] is short in comparison to the part then a [[lumped element model]] as described above is no longer adequate and a [[distributed element model]] must be used instead.  The mechanical distributed elements are entirely analogous to electrical distributed elements and the mechanical filter designer can use the methods of electrical [[distributed element filter]] design.&lt;ref name=Norton1/&gt;

==History==

===Harmonic telegraph===
Mechanical filter design was developed by applying the discoveries made in electrical filter theory to mechanics. However, a very early example (1870s) of acoustic filtering was the "[[harmonic telegraph]]", which arose precisely because electrical resonance was poorly understood but [[mechanical resonance]] (in particular, [[acoustic resonance]]) was very familiar to engineers. This situation was not to last for long; [[electrical resonance]] had been known to science for some time before this, and it was not long before engineers started to produce all-electric designs for filters. In its time, though, the harmonic telegraph was of some importance. The idea was to combine several telegraph signals on one telegraph line by what would now be called [[frequency division multiplexing]] thus saving enormously on line installation costs. The [[Telegraph key|key]] of each operator activated a vibrating electromechanical reed which converted this vibration into an electrical signal. Filtering at the receiving operator was achieved by a similar reed tuned to precisely the same frequency, which would only vibrate and produce a sound from transmissions by the operator with the identical tuning.&lt;ref name=Lund24&gt;Lundheim, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanch425&gt;Blanchard, p.425.&lt;/ref&gt;

Versions of the harmonic telegraph were developed by [[Elisha Gray]], [[Alexander Graham Bell]], [[Ernest Mercadier]]&lt;ref group=n&gt;[[:fr:Ernest Mercadier|Ernest Mercadier]] article in French Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt; and others. Its ability to act as a sound [[transducer]] to and from the electrical domain was to inspire the invention of the telephone.&lt;ref name=Lund24/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanch425/&gt;

===Mechanical equivalent circuits===
Once the basics of electrical network analysis began to be established, it was not long before the ideas of [[complex impedance]] and [[filter design]] theories were carried over into mechanics by analogy. [[Arthur E. Kennelly|Kennelly]], who was also responsible for introducing complex impedance, and [[Arthur Gordon Webster|Webster]] were the first to extend the concept of impedance into mechanical systems in 1920.&lt;ref name="Hunt, p.66"&gt;Hunt, p.66.&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanical admittance and the associated mobility analogy came much later and are due to Firestone in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, p.110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, p.321 cites&lt;br /&gt;F. A. Firestone, "A new analogy between mechanical and electrical systems", ''Journal of the Acoustical Society of America'', '''vol.4''', pp.249–267 (1932–1933).&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not enough to just develop a mechanical analogy. This could be applied to problems that were entirely in the mechanical domain, but for mechanical filters with an electrical application it is necessary to include the transducer in the analogy as well. [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] in 1907 was the first to describe a transducer as a pair of [[linear algebra]]ic equations relating electrical variables (voltage and current) to mechanical variables (force and velocity).&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, p.200 cites&lt;br /&gt;H. Poincaré. [http://henripoincarepapers.univ-lorraine.fr/bibliohp/index.php?a=on&amp;art=%C3%89tude+du+r%C3%A9cepteur+t%C3%A9l%C3%A9phonique&amp;action=Chercher "Etude du récepteur téléphonique"], ''Eclairage Electrique'', '''vol.50''', pp.221–372, 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; These equations can be expressed as a matrix relationship in much the same way as the [[impedance parameters|z-parameters]] of a [[two-port network]] in electrical theory, to which this is entirely analogous:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} V \\ F \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} z_{11} &amp; z_{12} \\ z_{21} &amp; z_{22} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} I \\ v \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' and ''I'' represent the voltage and current respectively on the electrical side of the transducer.

Wegel, in 1921, was the first to express these equations in terms of mechanical impedance as well as electrical impedance. The element &lt;math&gt; z_{22} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the open circuit mechanical impedance, that is, the impedance presented by the mechanical side of the transducer when no current is entering the electrical side. The element &lt;math&gt; z_{11} \,&lt;/math&gt;, conversely, is the clamped electrical impedance, that is, the impedance presented to the electrical side when the mechanical side is clamped and prevented from moving (velocity is zero). The remaining two elements, &lt;math&gt; z_{21} \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; z_{12} \,&lt;/math&gt;, describe the transducer forward and reverse transfer functions respectively. Once these ideas were in place, engineers were able to extend electrical theory into the mechanical domain and analyse an electromechanical system as a unified whole.&lt;ref name="Hunt, p.66"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, p.200 cites;&lt;br /&gt;R. L. Wegel, "Theory of magneto-mechanical systems as applied to telephone receivers and similar structures", ''Journal of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers'', '''vol.40''', pp.791–802, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound reproduction===
[[File:Harrison mechanical filter.png|thumb|300px|alt=A diagram of a phonograph mechanism with the mechanical impedance of each part shown in an equivalent circuit diagram. The identified elements are; needle point, needle elasticity (shunt), needle arm transformer, needle arm mass (series), pivot elasticity (series), needle arm elasticity (shunt), elasticity of attachment point of arm to spider (series), spider mass (series), diaphragm edge elasticity (series), air chamber elasticity (shunt), air chamber transformer, horn to air impedance (shunt).|'''Figure 2.''' Harrison's phonograph mechanism and its electrical equivalent circuit.]]
An early application of these new theoretical tools was in [[phonograph]]ic sound reproduction. A recurring problem with early phonograph designs was that mechanical resonances in the pickup and sound transmission mechanism caused excessively large peaks and troughs in the frequency response, resulting in poor sound quality. In 1923, Harrison of the [[Western Electric Company]] filed a patent for a phonograph in which the mechanical design was entirely represented as an electrical circuit. The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line, and is a resistive load for the rest of the circuit, while all the mechanical and acoustic parts—from the pickup needle through to the horn—are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy. The circuit arrived at is a [[ladder topology]] of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors. This can be viewed as a [[bandpass filter]] circuit. Harrison designed the component values of this filter to have a specific passband corresponding to the desired audio passband (in this case 100&amp;nbsp;Hz to 6&amp;nbsp;kHz) and a flat response. Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for the mechanical components in terms of mass and stiffness, which in turn could be translated into physical dimensions for their manufacture. The resulting phonograph has a flat frequency response in its passband and is free of the resonances previously experienced.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this, Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Norton mechanical filter.png|thumb|left|300px|alt=A diagram of a phonograph mechanism with the mechanical impedance of each part shown in an equivalent circuit diagram. The correspondence between mechanical parts and equivalent circuit elements is not indicated on the diagram (this is explained in the text of Norton's patent). A second circuit diagram is shown with the circuit transformed to a form more convenient for analysis as explained in the article text.|'''Figure 3.''' Norton's mechanical filter together with its electrical equivalent circuit.]]
Harrison used [[George Ashley Campbell|Campbell]]'s [[constant k filter|image filter]] theory, which was the most advanced filter theory available at the time. In this theory, filter design is viewed essentially as an [[impedance matching]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, 1929, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; More advanced filter theory was brought to bear on this problem by [[Edward Lawry Norton|Norton]] in 1929 at [[Bell Labs]]. Norton followed the same general approach though he later described to [[Sidney Darlington|Darlington]] the filter he designed as being "maximally flat".&lt;ref name="Darlington, p.7"/&gt; Norton's mechanical design predates the paper by [[Stephen Butterworth|Butterworth]] who is usually credited as the first to describe the electronic [[Butterworth filter|maximally flat filter]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Butterworth, "On the Theory of Filter Amplifiers", ''Wireless Engineer'', '''vol. 7''', 1930, pp. 536–541&lt;/ref&gt; The equations Norton gives for his filter correspond to a singly terminated Butterworth filter, that is, one driven by an ideal voltage source with no impedance, whereas the form more usually given in texts is for the doubly terminated filter with resistors at both ends, making it hard to recognise the design for what it is.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Norton, p.3 with Matthaei, pp.104–107.&lt;/ref&gt; Another unusual feature of Norton's filter design arises from the series capacitor, which represents the stiffness of the [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]]. This is the only series capacitor in Norton's representation, and without it, the filter could be analysed as a [[prototype filter|low-pass prototype]]. Norton moves the capacitor out of the body of the filter to the input at the expense of introducing a transformer into the equivalent circuit (Norton's figure 4). Norton has used here the "[[Equivalent impedance transforms#Transform 5.2|turning round the L]]" impedance transform to achieve this.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;

The definitive description of the subject from this period is Maxfield and Harrison's 1926 paper. There, they describe not only how mechanical bandpass filters can be applied to sound reproduction systems, but also apply the same principles to recording systems and describe a much improved disc cutting head.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Huang, p.360.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, p.68 cites&lt;br /&gt;J.P. Maxfield and H.C. Harrison, "Methods of high quality recording and reproducing of music and speech based on telephone research", ''Bell System Technical Journal'', '''vol 5''', pp.493–523, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume production===
The first volume production of mechanical filters was undertaken by [[Collins Radio|Collins Radio Company]] starting in the 1950s. These were originally designed for telephone frequency-division multiplex applications where there is commercial advantage in using high quality filters. Precision and steepness of the transition band leads to a reduced width of [[guard band]], which in turn leads to the ability to squeeze more telephone channels into the same cable.  This same feature is useful in radio transmitters for much the same reason.  Mechanical filters quickly also found popularity in VHF/UHF radio [[intermediate frequency]] (IF) stages of the high end radio sets (military, marine, [[amateur radio]] and the like) manufactured by Collins.  They were favoured in the radio application because they could achieve much higher Q-factors than the equivalent ''LC'' filter.  High ''Q'' allows filters to be designed which have high [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]], important for distinguishing adjacent radio channels in receivers.  They also had an advantage in stability over both ''LC'' filters and monolithic [[crystal filter]]s. The most popular design for radio applications was torsional resonators because radio IF typically lies in the 100 to 500&amp;nbsp;kHz band.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Huang, p.359.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carr, pp.54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transducers==
[[File:Mechanical filter transducers.svg|thumb|250px|alt=Three different transducers are depicted. (a) A metal rod with one end passing through a cylinder of magnetostrictive material on which is wound a coil of enamelled copper wire. (b) An upright cylindrical resonator in which there is sandwiched a horizontal layer of piezoelectric material. The Piezoelectric layer has an embedded electrode from which is leading an enamelled copper wire. (c) An upright cylindrical resonator in which there is sandwiched a vertical layer of piezoelectric material with an electrode as in (b).|'''Figure 4.''' Mechanical filter transducers. '''a''' magnetostrictive transducer. '''b''' Langevin type piezoelectric transducer. '''c''' torsional piezoelectric transducer.]]
Both [[magnetostrictive]] and [[piezoelectric]] transducers are used in mechanical filters. Piezoelectric transducers are favoured in recent designs since the piezoelectric material can also be used as one of the resonators of the filter, thus reducing the number of components and thereby saving space. They also avoid the susceptibility to extraneous magnetic fields of the  magnetostrictive type of transducer.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Huang, p.387.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetostrictive===
A magnetostrictive material is one which changes shape when a magnetic field is applied. In reverse, it produces a magnetic field when distorted. The magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the magnetostrictive material. The coil either induces a magnetic field in the transducer and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from the motion of the transducer at the filter output. It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range. It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a [[direct current|d.c.]] current superimposed on the signal, but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design.&lt;ref name=Carr170-2&gt;Carr, pp.170–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual magnetostrictive materials used for the transducer are either [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] or compressed powdered [[iron]]. Mechanical filter designs often have the resonators coupled with steel or nickel-iron wires, but on some designs, especially older ones, nickel wire may be used for the input and output rods. This is because it is possible to wind the transducer coil directly on to a nickel coupling wire since nickel is slightly magnetostrictive. However, it is not strongly so and coupling to the electrical circuit is weak. This scheme also has the disadvantage of [[eddy current]]s, a problem that is avoided if ferrites are used instead of nickel.&lt;ref name=Carr170-2/&gt;

The coil of the transducer adds some inductance on the electrical side of the filter. It is common practice to add a capacitor in parallel with the coil so that an additional resonator is formed which can be incorporated into the filter design. While this will not improve performance to the extent that an additional mechanical resonator would, there is some benefit and the coil has to be there in any case.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, c.2, l.14–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Piezoelectric===
A piezoelectric material is one which changes shape when an electric field is applied. In reverse, it produces an electric field when it is distorted. A piezoelectric transducer, in essence, is made simply by plating [[electrode]]s on to the piezoelectric material. Early piezoelectric materials used in transducers such as [[barium titanate]] had poor temperature stability.  This precluded the transducer from functioning as one of the resonators; it had to be a separate component.  This problem was solved with the introduction of [[lead zirconate titanate]] (abbreviated PZT) which is stable enough to be used as a resonator. Another common piezoelectric material is [[quartz]], which has also been used in mechanical filters.  However, [[ceramic]] materials such as PZT are preferred for their greater [[electromechanical coupling coefficient]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosen ''et al.'', pp.290–291, 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

One type of piezoelectric transducer is the Langevin type, named after a transducer used by [[Paul Langevin]] in early [[sonar]] research. This is good for longitudinal modes of vibration. It can also be used on resonators with other modes of vibration if the motion can be mechanically converted into a longitudinal motion. The transducer consists of a layer of piezoelectric material sandwiched transversally into a coupling rod or resonator.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen ''et al.'', pp.293–296, 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another kind of piezoelectric transducer has the piezoelectric material sandwiched in longitudinally, usually into the resonator itself. This kind is good for [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsional]] vibration modes and is called a torsional transducer.&lt;ref name=Rosen302&gt;Rosen ''et al.'', p.302.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resonators==
&lt;div style="float:right;margin-left:0.5em;"&gt;
{|class="wikitable"
!Material||Q-factor
|-
|Nickel|| several 100&lt;ref name=George1&gt;George, col.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|Aluminium|| ~10,000&lt;ref name=George1/&gt;
|-
|Nickel-iron alloy|| 10,000 to 25,000 &lt;br/&gt;depending on composition&lt;ref name=Lin286/&gt;
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

It is possible to achieve an extremely high ''[[Q factor|Q]]'' with mechanical resonators. Mechanical resonators typically have a ''Q'' of 10,000 or so, and 25,000 can be achieved in torsional resonators using a particular nickel-iron alloy. This is an unreasonably high figure to achieve with LC circuits, whose ''Q'' is limited by the resistance of the inductor coils.&lt;ref name=Carr170-2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lin286&gt;Lin ''et al.'', p.286.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor380/&gt;

Early designs in the 1940s and 1950s started by using steel as a resonator material. This has given way to nickel-iron alloys, primarily to maximise the ''Q'' since this is often the primary appeal of mechanical filters rather than price. Some of the metals that have been used for mechanical filter resonators and their ''Q'' are shown in the table.&lt;ref name=Lin286/&gt;

Piezoelectric crystals are also sometimes used in mechanical filter designs. This is especially true for resonators that are also acting as transducers for inputs and outputs.&lt;ref name=Lin286/&gt;

One advantage that mechanical filters have over LC electrical filters is that they can be made very stable. The resonance frequency can be made so stable that it varies only 1.5&amp;nbsp;[[parts per billion]] (ppb) from the specified value over the operating temperature range ({{nowrap|−25 to 85 °C}}), and its average drift with time can be as low as 4&amp;nbsp;ppb per day.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, p.171.&lt;/ref&gt; This stability with temperature is another reason for using nickel-iron as the resonator material. Variations with temperature in the resonance frequency (and other features of the frequency function) are directly related to variations in the [[Young's modulus]], which is a measure of stiffness of the material.  Materials are therefore sought that have a small [[temperature coefficient]] of Young's modulus.  In general, Young's modulus has a negative temperature coefficient (materials become less stiff with increasing temperature) but additions of small amounts of certain other elements in the alloy&lt;ref group=n&gt;See, for instance, [http://www.vacuumschmelze.de/index.php?id=686&amp;L=0&amp;no_cache=1&amp;sword_list&amp;#91;&amp;#93;=thermelast "Thermelast 4002"], a proprietary example of such an alloy, retrieved {{Nowrap|8 April}} 2010. (in German).  The first alloy to be discovered with this property was [[Elinvar]] for which, together with [[Invar]], [[Charles Edouard Guillaume]] received the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1920.  The original application was for temperature compensation of scientific measuring instruments, clocks and marine chronometers. (Gould, p.201.)&lt;/ref&gt; can produce a material with a temperature coefficient that changes sign from negative through zero to positive with temperature. Such a material will have a zero coefficient of temperature with resonance frequency around a particular temperature. It is possible to adjust the point of zero temperature coefficient to a desired position by heat treatment of the alloy.&lt;ref name=Taylor380/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Börner, Jürgen Spizner, "Mechanical frequency filter with additional coupling to increase slope of damping rise", col.4, {{US patent|3445792}}, filed {{Nowrap|28 June}} 1963, issued {{Nowrap|20 May}} 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alfhart Günther, "Method for aligning mechanical filters", col.2, {{US patent|3798077}}, filed {{Nowrap|24 September}} 1971, issued {{Nowrap|19 March}} 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1007/BF02697070 |title = Constant modulus alloys for mechanical oscillators |year = 1979 |last1 = Schneider |first1 = Wolfgang |last2 = Thomas |first2 = Hans |journal = Metallurgical Transactions A |volume = 10 |issue = 4 |pages = 433|bibcode = 1979MTA....10..433S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resonator modes===
[[File:Mechanical filter resonator modes.svg|thumb|right|350px|alt=Various resonator shapes are depicted with the vibration direction indicated with arrows and the vibration nodes indicated with broken lines.|'''Figure 5.''' Some possible vibrational modes of resonators]]It is usually possible for a mechanical part to [[vibration|vibrate]] in a number of different [[vibration mode|modes]], however the design will be based on a particular vibrational mode and the designer will take steps to try to restrict the resonance to this mode. As well as the straightforward [[longitudinal stress|longitudinal]] mode some others which are used include [[flexural strength|flexural]] mode, [[torsional vibration|torsional mode]], radial mode and [[vibrations of a circular drum|drumhead mode]].&lt;ref name=RockwellHow&gt;Rockwell-Collins, [http://www.rockwellcollins.com/about/additionalproducts/collinsfilters/mechanical_filters/index.html "How mechanical filters work"] &lt;!-- retrieved 11 November 2009. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Huang, pp.392–393.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modes are numbered according to the number of half-wavelengths in the vibration.  Some modes exhibit vibrations in more than one direction (such as drumhead mode which has two) and consequently the mode number consists of more than one number.  When the vibration is in one of the higher modes, there will be multiple nodes on the resonator where there is no motion. For some types of resonator, this can provide a convenient place to make a mechanical attachment for structural support. Wires attached at nodes will have no effect on the vibration of the resonator or the overall filter response. In figure 5, some possible anchor points are shown as wires attached at the nodes. The modes shown are (5a) the second longitudinal mode fixed at one end, (5b) the first torsional mode, (5c) the second torsional mode, (5d) the second flexural mode, (5e) first radial expansion mode and (5f) first radially symmetric drumhead mode.&lt;ref name=Taylor380&gt;Taylor &amp; Huang, p.380.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a great many combinations of resonators and transducers that can be used to construct a mechanical filter. A selection of some of these is shown in the diagrams. Figure 6 shows a filter using disc flexural resonators and magnetostrictive transducers. The transducer drives the centre of the first resonator, causing it to vibrate. The edges of the disc move in [[antiphase]] to the centre when the driving signal is at, or close to, resonance, and the signal is transmitted through the connecting rods to the next resonator.  When the driving signal is not close to resonance, there is little movement at the edges, and the filter rejects (does not pass) the signal.&lt;ref name=Naval450&gt;Bureau of Naval Personnel, p.450.&lt;/ref&gt; Figure 7 shows a similar idea involving longitudinal resonators connected together in a [[Signal chain (signal processing chain)|chain]] by connecting rods. In this diagram, the filter is driven by piezoelectric transducers. It could equally well have used magnetostrictive transducers.&lt;ref name=Rosen302/&gt; Figure 8 shows a filter using torsional resonators. In this diagram, the input has a torsional piezoelectric transducer and the output has a magnetostrictive transducer. This would be quite unusual in a real design, as both input and output usually have the same type of transducer. The magnetostrictive transducer is only shown here to demonstrate how longitudinal vibrations may be converted to torsional vibrations and vice versa.&lt;ref name=Rosen302/&gt;&lt;ref name=RockwellHow/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Huang, p.379.&lt;/ref&gt; Figure 9 shows a filter using drumhead mode resonators. The edges of the discs are fixed to the casing of the filter (not shown in the diagram) so the vibration of the disc is in the same modes as the membrane of a drum. Collins calls this type of filter a disc wire filter.&lt;ref name=RockwellHow/&gt;

The various types of resonator are all particularly suited to different frequency bands. Overall, mechanical filters with lumped elements of all kinds can cover frequencies from about 5 to 700&amp;nbsp;kHz although mechanical filters down as low as a few [[kilohertz]] (kHz) are rare.&lt;ref name=Carr170-2/&gt; The lower part of this range, below 100&amp;nbsp;kHz, is best covered with bar flexural resonators. The upper part is better done with torsional resonators.&lt;ref name=RockwellHow/&gt; Drumhead disc resonators are in the middle, covering the range from around 100 to 300&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name=Naval450/&gt;

The frequency response behaviour of all mechanical filters can be expressed as an equivalent electrical circuit using the impedance analogy described above. An example of this is shown in figure 8b which is the equivalent circuit of the mechanical filter of figure 8a. Elements on the electrical side, such as the inductance of the magnetostrictive transducer, are omitted but would be taken into account in a complete design. The series resonant circuits on the circuit diagram represent the torsional resonators, and the shunt capacitors represent the coupling wires. The component values of the electrical equivalent circuit can be adjusted, more or less at will, by modifying the dimensions of the mechanical components. In this way, all the theoretical tools of electrical analysis and filter design can be brought to bear on the mechanical design. Any filter realisable in electrical theory can, in principle, also be realised as a mechanical filter. In particular, the popular [[Analogue filter#Approximation|finite element approximations]] to an ideal filter response of the [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth]] and [[Chebyshev filter]]s can both readily be realised. As with the electrical counterpart, the more elements that are used, the closer the approximation approaches the ideal, however, for practical reasons the number of resonators does not normally exceed eight.&lt;ref name=Naval450/&gt;&lt;ref name=RockwellApps&gt;Rockwell-Collins, [http://www.rockwellcollins.com/about/additionalproducts/collinsfilters/app_notes/index.html "Mechanical filter application notes"] &lt;!-- retrieved 16 November 2009. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semi-lumped designs===
[[File:Mechanical filter semi-lumped disk flexual.svg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Three thin disc resonators are coupled together with long rods towards the edge of the discs. Transducers on the first and second disc are coupled with rods connected on the opposite edge of the disc. The transducers are of the type shown in figure 4a and each has a small bias magnet nearby. A pair of pivots are shown on each disc at the 90° positions relative to the coupling rods.|'''Figure 10a.''' A semi-lumped design using disc flexural resonators and λ/2 coupling wires]]
[[File:Mechanical filter semi-lumped equivalent circuit.svg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Circuit diagram depicting a ladder topology filter. The series branches consist of series LC circuits (three total) and the shunt branches consist of shunt LC circuits (two total).|'''Figure 10b.''' Equivalent circuit of the semi-lumped circuit above]]
Frequencies of the order of [[megahertz]] (MHz) are above the usual range for mechanical filters. The components start to become very small, or alternatively the components are large compared to the signal wavelength. The [[lumped element model]] described above starts to break down and the components must be considered as [[distributed element model|distributed elements]]. The frequency at which the transition from lumped to distributed models takes place is much lower for mechanical filters than it is for their electrical counterparts. This is because mechanical vibrations travel at the speed of sound for the material the component is composed of. For solid components, this is many times (x15 for nickel-iron) the speed of sound in air ({{nowrap|343 m/s}}) but still considerably less than the speed of electromagnetic waves (approx. {{nowrap|3x10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/s}} in vacuum). Consequently, mechanical wavelengths are much shorter than electrical wavelengths for the same frequency.  Advantage can be taken of these effects by deliberately designing components to be distributed elements, and the components and methods used in electrical [[distributed element filter]]s can be brought to bear. The equivalents of [[stub (electronics)|stubs]] and [[quarter wave impedance transformer|impedance transformers]] are both achievable. Designs which use a mixture of lumped and distributed elements are referred to as semi-lumped.&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;Mason.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of such a design is shown in figure 10a. The resonators are disc flexural resonators similar to those shown in figure 6, except that these are energised from an edge, leading to vibration in the fundamental flexural mode with a node in the centre, whereas the figure 6 design is energised in the centre leading to vibration in the second flexural mode at resonance. The resonators are mechanically attached to the housing by pivots at right angles to the coupling wires. The pivots are to ensure free turning of the resonator and minimise losses. The resonators are treated as lumped elements; however, the coupling wires are made exactly one half-wavelength (λ/2) long and are equivalent to a λ/2 open circuit stub in the electrical equivalent circuit. For a narrow-band filter, a stub of this sort has the approximate equivalent circuit of a parallel shunt tuned circuit as shown in figure 10b. Consequently, the connecting wires are being used in this design to add additional resonators into the circuit and will have a better response than one with just the lumped resonators and short couplings.&lt;ref name=Mason/&gt;  For even higher frequencies, microelectromechanical methods can be used as described below.

===Bridging wires===
Bridging wires are rods that couple together resonators that are not adjacent. They can be used to produce [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of attenuation in the [[stopband]]. This has the benefit of increasing the stopband rejection. When the pole is placed near the [[passband]] edge, it also has the benefit of increasing [[roll-off]] and narrowing the [[transition band]]. The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in figure 11. Bridging across a single resonator (figure 11b) can produce a pole of attenuation in the high stopband. Bridging across two resonators (figure 11c) can produce a pole of attenuation in both the high and the low stopband. Using multiple bridges (figure 11d) will result in multiple poles of attenuation. In this way, the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Huang, p.361.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mechanical filter bridged resonators.svg|thumb|center|800px|alt=A generic filter is depicted, consisting of a chain of coupled resonators, in four different bridging configurations. Filter (a) has no bridging wires, (b) has briding between resonators 3 and 5, (c) has bridging between resonators 2 and 5, and (d) has briding between resonators 2 and 6 and resonators 3 and 5. The bandpass frequency response of each is shown and is described in the article text.|'''Figure 11.''' Schematic bridging arrangements and their effect on frequency response.]]

The method of coupling between non-adjacent resonators is not limited to mechanical filters.  It can be applied to other filter formats and the general term for this class is [[cross-coupled filter]]. For instance, channels can be cut between [[cavity resonator]]s, [[mutual inductance]] can be used with discrete component filters, and feedback paths can be used with active [[analogue filter|analogue]] or [[digital filter]]s.  Nor was the method first discovered in the field of mechanical filters; the earliest description is in a 1948 patent for filters using [[microwave]] cavity resonators.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Pierce, "Guided-wave frequency range transducer," U.S. Patent 2,626,990, filed {{Nowrap|4 May}} 1948, issued {{Nowrap|27 January}} 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, mechanical filter designers were the first (1960s) to develop practical filters of this kind and the method became a particular feature of mechanical filters.&lt;ref&gt;Levy and Cohn, pp.1060–1061.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new technology emerging in mechanical filtering is [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS).  MEMS are very small [[micromachine]]s with component sizes measured in [[micrometre]]s (μm), but not as small as [[nanotechnology|nanomachines]].  These filters can be designed to operate at much higher frequencies than can be achieved with traditional mechanical filters.  These systems are mostly fabricated from [[silicon]] (Si), [[silicon nitride]] (Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), or [[polymer]]s. A common component used for [[radio frequency]] filtering (and MEMS applications generally), is the [[cantilever]] resonator. Cantilevers are simple mechanical components to manufacture by much the same methods used by the semiconductor industry; masking, [[photolithography]] and etching, with a final undercutting etch to separate the cantilever from the substrate. The technology has great promise since cantilevers can be produced in large numbers on a single substrate—much as large numbers of transistors are currently contained on a single silicon chip.&lt;ref&gt;de los Santos, pp.167–183.&lt;/ref&gt;

The resonator shown in figure 12 is around 120 μm in length. Experimental complete filters with an operating frequency of 30&amp;nbsp;GHz have been produced using cantilever [[varactor]]s as the resonator elements. The size of this filter is around 4×3.5&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;de los Santos, p.169.&lt;/ref&gt; Cantilever resonators are typically applied at frequencies below 200&amp;nbsp;MHz, but other structures, such as micro-machined cavities, can be used in the microwave bands.&lt;ref&gt;de los Santos, p.167.&lt;/ref&gt; Extremely high ''Q'' resonators can be made with this technology; flexural mode resonators with a ''Q'' in excess of 80,000 at 8&amp;nbsp;MHz are reported.&lt;ref&gt;de los Santos, p.171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adjustment==
The precision applications in which mechanical filters are used require that the resonators are accurately adjusted to the specified resonance frequency.  This is known as ''trimming'' and usually involves a mechanical machining process.  In most filter designs, this can be difficult to do once the resonators have been assembled into the complete filter so the resonators are trimmed before assembly.  Trimming is done in at least two stages; coarse and fine, with each stage bringing the resonance frequency closer to the specified value.  Most trimming methods involve removing material from the resonator which will increase the resonance frequency.  The target frequency for a coarse trimming stage consequently needs to be set below the final frequency since the [[engineering tolerance|tolerances]] of the process could otherwise result in a frequency higher than the following fine trimming stage could adjust for.&lt;ref name=Johnson245&gt;Johnson, 1983, p.245.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kasai&gt;Kasai ''et al.'', cols.1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The coarsest method of trimming is [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] of the main resonating surface of the resonator; this process has an accuracy of around {{nowrap|±800 [[Parts per million|ppm]]}}.  Better control can be achieved by grinding the edge of the resonator instead of the main surface.  This has a less dramatic effect and consequently better accuracy.  Processes that can be used for fine trimming, in order of increasing accuracy, are [[Abrasive blasting|sandblasting]], drilling, and [[laser ablation]].  Laser trimming is capable of achieving an accuracy of {{nowrap|±40 ppm}}.&lt;ref name=Kasai/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 1983, pp.245–246.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trimming by hand, rather than machine, was used on some early production components but would now normally only be encountered during product development.  Methods available include [[sanding]] and [[File (tool)|filing]].  It is also possible to add material to the resonator by hand, thus reducing the resonance frequency.  One such method is to add [[solder]], but this is not suitable for production use since the solder will tend to reduce the high ''Q'' of the resonator.&lt;ref name=Johnson245/&gt;

In the case of MEMS filters, it is not possible to trim the resonators outside of the filter because of the integrated nature of the device construction.  However, trimming is still a requirement in many MEMS applications.  Laser ablation can be used for this but material deposition methods are available as well as material removal.  These methods include [[Pulsed laser deposition|laser]] or [[Ion beam deposition|ion-beam induced deposition]].&lt;ref&gt;Lin ''et al.'', p.293.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Double effect evaporator.PNG|right|thumb|200px|diagram of a double-effect falling film evaporator.  Condensing vapors from flash tank B1 heat evaporator A2. 1=feed, 2=product, 3=steam, 4=vapors]]
A '''multiple-effect evaporator''', as defined in [[chemical engineering]], is an apparatus for efficiently using the heat from [[steam]] to evaporate water.&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.nzifst.org.nz/unitoperations/evaporation2.htm Unit Operations in Food Processing - R. L. Earle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In a multiple-effect evaporator, water is boiled in a sequence of vessels, each held at a lower pressure than the last.  Because the boiling temperature of water decreases as pressure decreases, the vapor boiled off in one vessel can be used to heat the next, and only the first vessel (at the highest pressure) requires an external source of heat.  While in theory, evaporators may be built with an arbitrarily large number of stages, evaporators with more than four stages are rarely practical except in systems where the liquor is the desired product such as in chemical recovery systems where up to seven effects are used.

The multiple-effect evaporator was invented by an African-American inventor and engineer [[Norbert Rillieux]].  Although he may have designed the apparatus during the 1820s and constructed a prototype in 1834, he did not build the first industrially practical evaporator until 1845.  Originally designed for concentrating [[sugar]] in [[sugar cane]] juice, it has since become widely used in all industrial applications where large volumes of water must be evaporated, such as [[salt]] production and water [[desalination]].

Multiple effect evaporation commonly uses sensible heat in the condensate to preheat liquor to be flashed.  In practice the design liquid flow paths can be somewhat complicated in order to extract the most recoverable heat and to obtain the highest evaporation rates from the equipment. 

Multiple-effect evaporation plants in [[Sugar_beet#Evaporation|sugar beet factories]] have up to eight effects.  Six effect evaporators are common in the recovery of black liquor in the [[kraft process]] for making wood pulp.

An '''online model''' is a mathematical model which tracks and mirrors a plant or process in real-time, and which is implemented with some form of automatic adaptivity to compensate for model degradation over time.

== Relationship to other kinds of models ==

An online model is also sometimes referred to as an "online simulator"&lt;ref name="online"&gt;[http://www.simone.eu/simone-simonesoftware-onlinesimulation.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="online2"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/9780470172445.ch13 | title=On-Line Simulation: Need and Evolving Research Requirements | journal=Handbook of Simulation | pages=465–516 | last1 = Davis | first1 = Wayne J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "online system".&lt;ref name="wea"&gt;[http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=SPE-112130-MS&amp;soc=SPE]&lt;/ref&gt;

An online model is related to the concept of [[real-time simulation]], as an online model runs in '''real-time''' by definition. 
Conversely a [[real-time simulation]] is not necessarily an online model as it by definition does not require adaptivity in either states or parameters.

While many models are adjusted to better fit historical data, traditionally this is done in campaigns or during initial design, and often this is done either manually or with a combination of mathematical and manual methods.  By contrast, online models include some automatic procedure to adapt to new process data.

== Background and context ==

Online models are an aspect of [[process simulation]] that deals with the use of estimation techniques to ensure that the state and parameter of the process model are as close a match as possible to the real plant.

Reasons that models may need to be taken online include that it is not possible to find offline data for the entire range of operating conditions or that the process is time-varying
.&lt;ref name=a3&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F19%2F5200743%2F04982740.pdf%3Farnumber%3D4982740&amp;authDecision=-203]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parameter estimation]] can also be used as a technique to capture the influence of effects that are not explicitly modeled, in which case parameters may need to take on values that differ from text-book or table values.

== Uses ==

An online model as defined here has the useful property that it closely resembles the real plant, and for this reason the online model can at any time by used to assess planned changes in operations, either for control, for optimization and for different operational tasks to be performed. It can then be used amongst other things for real-time monitoring, de-bottlenecking or plant redesign,&lt;ref name=a2&gt;[http://www.ivt.ntnu.no/ept/fag/tep4215/innhold/LNG%20Conferences/2007/fscommand/PS7_3_Skjerven_s.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; or for "what-if" analysis.

Analyzing trends of how estimated parameters and states in the updated model have changed over time may itself be useful for detecting errors or events in that have occurred during operation and influenced the plant.

== Techniques ==

The concepts of online models have origins in [[control engineering]].

Online models have three commonalities:
* feeding the same control and disturbance signals to the model as is fed to the plant,
* synchronizing simulation clock with the real-world clock, and
* adaptivity: adjustment in states and/or parameters at regular intervals by feedback from measurements.

One important aspect of bringing a model online is [[parameter estimation]]. By some means the parameters of the online model should match the real plant for the model to be a useful analog. [[System identification]] and [[estimation theory]] describe techniques to estimate values of unknown parameters.

Using observers such as the [[Kalman filter]] or the moving-horizon estimator, it is possible to do [[state estimation]], updating the state of the model to ensure that measured and modeled outputs remain as close as possible over time.

It is possible to combine state and parameter estimation, for instance by using an augmented Kalman filter.

Mathematical process models can be used for engineering in the design phase prior to building whole or part of a process plant, but models cannot be brought online at this stage as no process data exists to feed to the model.
However once the plant is built and in use, it is tempting to reuse the model used in the design phase for operation, control and optimization tasks. Re-using models in this manner is often term "life-cycle simulators".&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=a1&gt;[http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=SPE-128490-MS&amp;soc=SPE]&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative way to obtain an online model is to build one from scratch for this purpose, the advantage of this approach is that issues such as complexity and simulation speed can be tailored for the needs of online use.

== Applications ==

Online models are used in 
* '''weather forecasting''', where techniques used are often termed [[data assimilation]],
* '''[[reservoir simulation]]''', where techniques used are often termed (automatic) history matching,
* model-based control, for instance nonlinear [[model predictive control]], where adaptivity in  model states and parameters are often introduced by use of an augmented [[Kalman Filter]],&lt;ref name="modelonline"&gt;[http://www.cybernetica.name/v3/products/ModelOnLine/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and in
* [[process simulation]],  where such models are sometimes referred to as "lifecycle simulators" &lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;

'''Open innovation''' is a term used to promote an [[information age]] mindset toward innovation that runs counter to the [[secrecy#Technology_secrecy|secrecy]] and [[information silo|silo mentality]] of traditional corporate research labs. The benefits and driving forces behind increased openness have been noted and discussed as far back as the 1960s, especially as it pertains to interfirm cooperation in R&amp;D.&lt;ref name=HartmannTrott2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=HARTMANN |first1=DAP |last2=TROTT |first2=PAUL |title=WHY 'OPEN INNOVATION' IS OLD WINE IN NEW BOTTLES |journal=International Journal of Innovation Management |date=Dec 2009 |volume=13 |issue=4| pages=715–736 |url=http://enterrasolutions.com/media/docs/2013/02/1.pdf|accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the term 'open innovation' in reference to the increasing embrace of external cooperation in a complex world has been promoted in particular by [[Henry Chesbrough]], adjunct professor and faculty director of the Center for Open Innovation of the [[Haas School of Business]] at the University of California,&lt;ref&gt;http://facultybio.haas.berkeley.edu/faculty-list/chesbrough-henry&lt;/ref&gt; who articulated a modern perspective in his book ''Open Innovation: The new imperative for creating and profiting from technology'' (2003).&lt;ref name="chesbrough2003a"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chesbrough |first=Henry William |date=1 March 2003 |title=Open Innovation: The new imperative for creating and profiting from technology |location=Boston |publisher=Harvard Business School Press |isbn=978-1578518371}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was originally referred to as "a paradigm that assumes that firms can and should use external ideas as well as internal ideas, and internal and external paths to market, as the firms look to advance their technology".&lt;ref name="chesbrough2003a" /&gt; More recently, it is defined as "a distributed innovation process based on purposively managed knowledge flows across organizational boundaries, using pecuniary and non-pecuniary mechanisms in line with the organization's business model".&lt;ref&gt;Chesbrough, H., &amp; Bogers, M. 2014. [http://media.wix.com/ugd/d6c2f0_a0df00c962dc43549bd8e5d05f6e15a8.pdf Explicating open innovation: Clarifying an emerging paradigm for understanding innovation]. In H. Chesbrough, W. Vanhaverbeke, &amp; J. West (Eds.), ''New Frontiers in Open Innovation'': 3-28. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Page 17. &lt;/ref&gt; This more recent definition acknowledges that open innovation is not solely firm-centric: it also includes [[Creative consumer|creative consumers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berthon|first=Pierre R.|last2=Pitt|first2=Leyland F.|last3=McCarthy|first3=Ian|last4=Kates|first4=Steven M.|date=2007-01-01|title=When customers get clever: Managerial approaches to dealing with creative consumers|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681306000796|journal=Business Horizons|volume=50|issue=1|pages=39–47|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2006.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and communities of user innovators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Joel|last2=Lakhani|first2=Karim R.|date=2008-04-01|title=Getting Clear About Communities in Open Innovation|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13662710802033734|journal=Industry and Innovation|volume=15|issue=2|pages=223–231|doi=10.1080/13662710802033734|issn=1366-2716}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boundaries between a firm and its environment have become more permeable; innovations can easily transfer inward and outward between firms and other firms and between firms and creative consumers, resulting in impacts at the level of the consumer, the firm, an industry, and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bogers|first=Marcel|last2=Zobel|first2=Ann-Kristin|last3=Afuah|first3=Allan|last4=Almirall|first4=Esteve|last5=Brunswicker|first5=Sabine|last6=Dahlander|first6=Linus|last7=Frederiksen|first7=Lars|last8=Gawer|first8=Annabelle|last9=Gruber|first9=Marc|date=2017-01-01|title=The open innovation research landscape: established perspectives and emerging themes across different levels of analysis|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13662716.2016.1240068|journal=Industry and Innovation|volume=24|issue=1|pages=8–40|doi=10.1080/13662716.2016.1240068|issn=1366-2716}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Because innovations tend to be produced by outsiders and [[Founder CEO|founders]] in [[startups]], rather than existing organizations, the central idea behind open innovation is that, in a world of widely distributed knowledge, companies cannot afford to rely entirely on their own research, but should instead buy or license processes or inventions (i.e. patents) from other companies. In addition, internal inventions not being used in a firm's business should be taken outside the company (e.g. through licensing, joint ventures or [[Corporate spin-off|spin-offs]]).&lt;ref name="chesbrough2003b"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chesbrough |first=Henry William |year=2003 |title=The era of open innovation |journal=MIT Sloan Management Review |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=35–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The open innovation paradigm can be interpreted to go beyond just using external sources of innovation such as customers, rival companies, and academic institutions, and can be as much a change in the use, management, and employment of [[intellectual property]] as it is in the technical and research driven generation of intellectual property. In this sense, it is understood as the systematic encouragement and exploration of a wide range of internal and external sources for innovative opportunities, the integration of this exploration with firm capabilities and resources, and the exploitation of these opportunities through multiple channels.&lt;ref name="gallagherwest2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = J. | last2 = Gallagher | first2 = S. | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9310.2006.00436.x | title = Challenges of open innovation: The paradox of firm investment in open-source software | journal = R and D Management | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 319 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

Open innovation offers several benefits to companies operating on a program of global collaboration:
* Reduced cost of conducting research and development
* Potential for improvement in development productivity
* Incorporation of customers early in the development process
* Increase in accuracy for market research and customer targeting
* Potential for synergism between internal and external innovations
* Potential for viral marketing&lt;ref name="schuttemarais2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schutte |first1=Corne |last2=Marais |first2=Stephan |year=2010 |title=The Development of Open Innovation Models to Assist the Innovation Process |location=University of Stellenbosch, South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==

Implementing a model of open innovation is naturally associated with a number of risks and challenges, including:
* Possibility of revealing information not intended for sharing
* Potential for the hosting organization to lose their [[competitive advantage]] as a consequence of revealing intellectual property
* Increased complexity of controlling innovation and regulating how contributors affect a project
* Devising a means to properly identify and incorporate external innovation
* Realigning innovation strategies to extend beyond the firm in order to maximize the return from external innovation&lt;ref name="gallagherwest2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="schuttemarais2010"/&gt;

==Models==

=== Government driven ===
In the UK the Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTP) is a funding mechanism encouraging the partnership between a firm and a knowledge-based partner.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greco|first=Marco|last2=Locatelli|first2=Giorgio|last3=Lisi|first3=Stefano|date=2017-05-01|title=Open innovation in the power &amp; energy sector: Bringing together government policies, companies’ interests, and academic essence|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421517300575|journal=Energy Policy|volume=104|pages=316–324|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.049}}&lt;/ref&gt; A KTP is a collaboration program between a knowledge-based partner (i.e. a research institution), a company partner and one or more associates (i.e. recently qualified persons such as graduates). KTP initiatives aim to deliver significant improvement in business partners’ profitability as a direct result of the partnership through enhanced quality and operations, increased sales and access to new markets. At the end of their KTP project, the three actors involved have to prepare a final report that describes KTP initiative supported the achievement of the project’s innovation goals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Product platforming===
This approach involves developing and introducing a partially completed product, for the purpose of providing a framework or tool-kit for contributors to access, customize, and exploit. The goal is for the contributors to extend the platform product's functionality while increasing the overall value of the product for everyone involved.

Readily available software frameworks such as a [[software development kit]] (SDK), or an [[application programming interface]] (API) are common examples of product platforms. This approach is common in markets with strong [[network effect]]s where demand for the product implementing the framework (such as a mobile phone, or an online application) increases with the number of developers that are attracted to use the platform tool-kit. The high scalability of platforming often results in an increased complexity of administration and quality assurance.&lt;ref name="schuttemarais2010"/&gt;

===Idea competitions===
This model entails implementing a system that encourages competitiveness among contributors by rewarding successful submissions. Developer competitions such as [[hackathon]] events fall under this category of open innovation. This method provides organizations with inexpensive access to a large quantity of innovative ideas, while also providing a deeper insight into the needs of their customers and contributors.&lt;ref name="schuttemarais2010"/&gt;

===Customer immersion===
While mostly oriented toward the end of the product development cycle, this technique involves extensive customer interaction through employees of the host organization. Companies are thus able to accurately incorporate customer input, while also allowing them to be more closely involved in the design process and product management cycle.&lt;ref name="schuttemarais2010"/&gt;

===Collaborative product design and development===
Similarly to product platforming, an organization incorporates their contributors into the development of the product. This differs from platforming in the sense that, in addition to the provision of the framework on which contributors develop, the hosting organization still controls and maintains the eventual products developed in collaboration with their contributors. This method gives organizations more control by ensuring that the correct product is developed as fast as possible, while reducing the overall cost of development.&lt;ref name="schuttemarais2010"/&gt;  Dr. [[Henry Chesbrough]] recently supported this model for open innovation in the optics and photonics industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chesbrough|first=Henry|author2=Eichenholz, Jason|title=Open Innovation in Photonics|journal=SPIE Professional|date=January 2013|volume=8|pages=24–25|doi=10.1117/2.4201301.15|url=http://spie.org/x91420.xml|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovation networks===
Similarly to idea competitions, an organization leverages a network of contributors in the design process by offering a reward in the form of an [[incentive]]. The difference relates to the fact that the network of contributors are used to develop solutions to identified problems within the development process, as opposed to new products.&lt;ref name="schuttemarais2010"/&gt; Emphasis needs to be placed on assessing organisational capabilities to ensure value creation in open innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, N., &amp; Helfert, M. (2015). Service capabilities within open innovation: Revisiting the applicability of capability maturity models. Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 28(2), 275-303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JEIM-10-2013-0078&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In science ===
In [[Austria]] the [[Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft]] started a project named "[http://www.openinnovationinscience.at/the-project.html Tell us!]" about mental health issues and used the concept of open innovation to [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsource]] research questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://futurezone.at/science/open-innovation-ausbildungsprogramm-gestartet/193.115.115|title=Open Innovation: Ausbildungsprogramm gestartet|website=futurezone.at|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.profil.at/portfolio/lab-open-innovation-lehrgang-ludwig-boltzmann-gesellschaft-6273505|title="Lab for Open Innovation"-Lehrgang der Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft {{!}} PROFIL.at|date=2016-03-17|website=profil.at|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute also launched the first "[http://www.openinnovationinscience.at/lois-en.html Lab for Open Innovation in Science]" to teach 20 selected scientists the concept of open innovation over the course of one year. On Facebook the [[Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft]] informs about the lab, the participants and teachers and on news on open innovation in [https://www.facebook.com/Lab-for-Open-Innovation-in-Science-1616874418526749/ science].

=== In engineering ===
A European startup has proved that engineering crowdsourcing delivers good results for open innovation in technology. This startup, ennomotive, organizes competitions to solve real-life engineering challenges coming from companies. Its global community of engineers submits solutions through an online platform and, after a multi-round filtering process, the company selects and awards the best solutions. This way, complex issues like asphalting in the rain or monitoring wildfires in the forest through IoT have been solved.

==Versus closed innovation==
The paradigm of [[closed innovation]] holds that successful innovation requires control. Particularly, a company should control the generation of their own ideas, as well as production, marketing, distribution, servicing, financing, and supporting. What drove this idea is that, in the early twentieth century, academic and government institutions were not involved in the commercial application of science. As a result, it was left up to other corporations to take the [[new product development]] cycle into their own hands. There just was not the time to wait for the scientific community to become more involved in the practical application of science. There also was not enough time to wait for other companies to start producing some of the components that were required in their final product. These companies became relatively self-sufficient, with little communication directed outwards to other companies or universities.

Throughout the years several factors emerged that paved the way for open innovation paradigms:
* The increasing availability and mobility of skilled workers
* The growth of the venture capital market
* External options for ideas sitting on the shelf
* The increasing capability of external suppliers

These four factors have resulted in a new market of knowledge. Knowledge is not anymore proprietary to the company. It resides in employees, suppliers, customers, competitors and universities. If companies do not use the knowledge they have inside, someone else will. Innovation can be generated either by means of closed innovation or by open innovation paradigms.&lt;ref name="chesbrough2003a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chesbrough2003b"/&gt; There is an ongoing debate on which paradigm will dominate in the future.

==Terminology==
Modern research of open innovation is divided into two groups, which have several names, but are similar in their essence (discovery and exploitation; outside-in and inside-out; inbound and 
outbound). The common factor for different names is the direction of innovation, whether from outside the company  in, or from inside the company out:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Busarovs|first1=Aleksejs|title=OPEN INNOVATION: CURRENT TRENDS AND  FUTURE PERSPECTIVES|journal=Humanities and Social Sciences: Latvia|date=2013|volume=21|issue=2|pages=103–119|url=http://www.lu.lv/fileadmin/user_upload/lu_portal/apgads/PDF/Hum_Soc-scienc-2013_2_.pdf#page=103|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Revealing (non-pecuniary outbound innovation)
This type of open innovation is when a company freely shares its resources with other partners, without an instant financial reward. The source of profit has an indirect nature and is manifested as a new type of business model.

;Selling (pecuniary outbound innovation)
In this type of open innovation a company commercialises its inventions and technology through selling or licensing technology to a third party.

;Sourcing (non-pecuniary inbound innovation)
This type of open innovation is when companies use freely available external knowledge, as a source of internal innovation. Before starting any internal R&amp;D project a company should monitor the external environment in search for existing solutions, thus, in this case, internal R&amp;D become tools to absorb external ideas for internal needs.

;Acquiring (pecuniary inbound innovation)
In this type of open innovation a company is buying innovation from its partners through licensing, or other procedures, involving monetary reward for external knowledge

==Versus open source==
[[Open source]] and open innovation might conflict on patent issues. This conflict is particularly apparent when considering technologies that may save lives, or other [[Open-source-appropriate technology|open-source-appropriate technologies]] that may assist in [[poverty]] reduction or [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 = J. M. | title = The case for open source appropriate technology | doi = 10.1007/s10668-012-9337-9 | journal = Environment, Development and Sustainability | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 425–431 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[open source]] and open innovation are not mutually exclusive, because participating companies can donate their patents to an independent organization, put them in a common pool, or grant unlimited license use to anybody. Hence some open-source initiatives can merge these two concepts: this is the case for instance for IBM with its ''[[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]]'' platform, which the company presents as a case of open innovation, where competing companies are invited to cooperate inside an open-innovation network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/membersminutes/20070920MembersMeeting/07.09.12-Eclipse-Open-Innovation.pdf |title=Eclipse and Open innovation |date=12 September 2007 |format=pdf |publisher=Eclipse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[Eric S. Raymond|Eric Raymond]], writing about the open-source software movement, coined the term [[The Cathedral and the Bazaar|''the cathedral and the bazaar'']]. The cathedral represented the conventional method of employing a group of experts to design and develop software (though it could apply to any large-scale creative or innovative work). The bazaar represented the open-source approach. This idea has been amplified by a lot of people, notably [[Don Tapscott]] and [[Anthony D. Williams (author)|Anthony D. Williams]] in their book [[Wikinomics]]. Eric Raymond himself is also quoted as saying that 'one cannot code from the ground up in bazaar style. One can test, debug, and improve in bazaar style, but it would be very hard to originate a project in bazaar mode'. In the same vein, Raymond is also quoted as saying 'The individual wizard is where successful bazaar projects generally start'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Nicholas G. |last=Carr |url=http://www.strategy-business.com/press/enewsarticle/enews053107 |title=The Ignorance of Crowds| magazine=Strategy+Business |date=29 May 2007 |issue=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''payment card industry''' ('''PCI''') denotes the [[debit]], [[Credit (finance)|credit]], [[Stored-value card|prepaid]], [[e-purse]], [[Automated teller machine|ATM]], and [[Point of sale|POS]] cards and associated businesses.

== Overview ==
The payment card industry consists of all the organizations which store, process and transmit cardholder data, most notably for [[debit card]]s and [[credit card]]s. The security standards are developed by the [[Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council]] which develops the [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]]s used throughout the industry. Individual card brands establish compliance requirements that are used by service providers and have their own compliance programs. Major card brands include [[American Express]], [[Discover Card|Discover Financial Services]], [[China UnionPay]],  [[Japan Credit Bureau]], [[MasterCard|MasterCard Worldwide]] and [[Visa (company)|Visa International]]. Most companies use member banks that connect and accept transactions from the card brands. Not all card brands use member banks, like American Express, these instead act as their own bank.&lt;ref name="sdcr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdcr.com/pci-pdfs/Compliance-Overview-PCI.pdf | title=A Compliance Overview for the Payment Card Industry (PCI) | publisher=Coalfire Systems Inc. 2009 | date=2009 | accessdate=1 August 2014 | author=McAndrew, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2014}}, the United States uses a [[magnetic stripe]] on a card to process transactions and its security relies on the holder's signature and visual inspection of the card to check for features such as [[hologram]]. This system will be outmoded and replaced by [[EMV]] in 2015.&lt;ref name=ars /&gt;{{Update inline|date=February 2018}} EMV is a global standard for inter-operation of [[smart card|integrated circuit card]]s (IC cards or "chip cards") and IC card capable [[point of sale]] (POS) terminals and [[automated teller machine]]s (ATMs), for authenticating [[credit card|credit]] and [[debit card]] transactions. It has enhanced security features, but is still susceptible to fraud.&lt;ref name="ars"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2014/08/chip-based-credit-cards-are-a-decade-old-why-doesnt-the-us-rely-on-them-yet/ | title=Chip-based credit cards are a decade old; why doesn’t the US rely on them yet? | work=[[Ars Technica]] | date=2 August 2014 | accessdate=2 August 2014 | author=Geuss, Megan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council ==
{{main|Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council}}
On 7 September 2006, [[American Express]], [[Discover Card|Discover Financial Services]], [[Japan Credit Bureau]], [[MasterCard|MasterCard Worldwide]] and [[Visa (company)|Visa International]] formed the [[Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council]] (PCI SSC) security council with the goal of managing the ongoing evolution of the [[PCI DSS|Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]].  The council itself claims to be independent of the various card vendors that make up the council. As of 1 August 2014, the PCI SSC website lists 688 "Participating Organizations".&lt;ref name="total"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/get_involved/member_list.php/member_list.php?category=&amp;region=&amp;alphaFilter= | title=Participating Organizations | publisher=Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council | accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, 61 different financial institutions were noted, including [[Bank of America]], [[Capital One]], [[JP Morgan Chase]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], [[Toronto-Dominion Bank|TD Bank]] and [[Wells Fargo]].&lt;ref name=total /&gt; A total of 275 merchants were listed,  including [[Amazon.com]], [[Burger King]], [[Citgo]], [[Dell]], [[Equifax]], [[Exxon Mobil]], [[Global Cash Access]], [[Motorola]], [[Microsoft]], [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Walmart]].&lt;ref name=total /&gt;

== Industry growth ==
MasterCard's Nicole Krieg has noted that the Russian credit card market started in early 2000, when issuers first began launching products.&lt;ref name=cardline /&gt; However, credit products became especially popular in Russia in 2005, after new legislation took effect. Immense growth was noted in just eight years, by comparing second quarter growth on Visa card purchases, which went from $306 million in 2002 to $61.5 billion in 2010. Merchants who accepted Visa cards also increased from 21,000 to 331,000 during the same period. Visa also noted that they had issued 70 million cards and the [[Central Bank of the Russian Federation]] reported that 8.6 million credit cards were on issue.&lt;ref name="cardline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-239403845.html | title=Card Brands, Issuers Report Dramatic Rise In Russian Card Market | work=Cardline | date=15 October 2010 | accessdate=1 August 2014 |subscription= yes |via=[[HighBeam Research]] | author=Peshkov, Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regional and national payment schemes ==

=== Interac Association ===

The [[Interac]] Association is Canada's national organization linking Financial Institutions and enterprises that have proprietary networks, to enable communication with each other for the purpose of exchanging electronic financial transactions. The Association was founded in 1984 by the big five banks. Today, there are over 80 members. The Interac Association is the organization responsible for the development of Canada's national network of two shared electronic financial services: Shared Cash Dispensing (SCD) for cash withdrawals from any ABM not belonging to a cardholder's financial institution; and Interac Direct Payment (IDP) for Debit Card payments at the Point-of-Sale

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8874">Questions over '''[[personal jurisdiction]] over international defendants in the United States''' arise when foreign nationals commit crimes against Americans, or when a person from or in a different country is sued in U.S. courts, or when events took place in another country.  Such cases arise when crimes are committed on the [[high seas]] or on international flights, when crimes are alleged to be committed by or against Americans in foreign countries (such as under the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]]), or when crimes are committed by foreigners against Americans.  The [[Internet]] also allows [[computer crime]] to cross international boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d07705.pdf Cybercrime: Public and Private Entities Face Challenges in Addressing Cyber Threats]."[[United States Government Accountability Office]] June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism in public international law for exercising jurisdiction over an international defendant==
There are several mechanisms in [[public international law]] whereby the courts of one country (the domestic court) can exercise [[jurisdiction]] over a [[citizen]], [[corporation]], or organization of another country (the foreign defendant) to try crimes or [[Lawsuit|civil matters]] that have affected citizens or businesses within the domestic jurisdiction. Many of these jurisdictional "hooks" can even reach conduct that affected the domestic citizen when the citizen was beyond his or her domestic borders. There are five such doctrines:&lt;ref&gt;Damrosch, Henkin, Pugh, Schachter, and Smit, ''International Law: Cases and Materials'', 3 Ed., West 1993, 1090.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The '''[[territorial principle]]''' is the most important and widely used. It is the idea that a state may claim jurisdiction over persons and events inside its own territory. So, foreign nationals committing crimes in the U.S. are subject to U.S. courts and U.S. laws.
*The '''nationality principle''' holds that the government of a citizen can obtain jurisdiction over its citizen even when that citizen is abroad. For example, U.S. citizens are still required to pay [[Taxation in the United States|federal taxes]] to the U.S. government when abroad and may be prosecuted for a failure to do so.
*The '''passive personality principle''' is an interesting offshoot of the nationality principle. It looks to the nationality of the ''victim'' to determine jurisdiction, holding that a state may assert jurisdiction over persons and events outside a state's territory on the basis that its citizen has been harmed. In the case of ''United States v. Roberts'', 1 F.Supp. 2d 601 (E.D. La. 1998), which had an unusual set of facts, the victim of a crime of [[sexual abuse]] of a [[Minor (law)|minor]] (who was a [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizen]]) had a case tried against her aggressor who was a citizen of the Caribbean island of [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]. The crime took place on [[international waters]] on board a ship registered in [[Liberia]] and owned by a company incorporated in the [[Panama|Republic of Panama]]. None of the regular methods of jurisdiction, [[forum non conveniens]], or [[comity]] would have worked. ''Id''. The defendant was indicted by a federal [[grand jury]] in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana|Eastern District of Louisiana]] and the [[Defendant|defendant's]] [[Motion (legal)|motion to dismiss]] for lack of [[personal jurisdiction]] was denied by the [[United States district court|federal district court]], which found jurisdiction under the passive personality principle.
*The '''protective principle''' is one of [[national security]] and it holds that a state may have jurisdiction over a defendant accused of acts in pursuance of overthrowing the host state's government. See ''United States v. Yousef'', 327 F3d 56 (2d Cir. 2003).
*The '''[[Universal jurisdiction|universality principle]]''' (principle of universal jurisdiction) is closely aligned with the international law doctrine of [[peremptory norm]]s (''[[jus cogens]]''). The principle holds that all states have jurisdiction over crimes that are universally recognized to be a [[crime against humanity]]. These have historically included [[piracy]], [[History of slavery|slave-trading]], [[torture]], [[genocide]], and perhaps [[terrorism]].

In the United States, the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] have recognized an important mechanism for acquiring jurisdiction over foreign defendants known as the effects doctrine. The effects doctrine is an offshoot of the territorial principle. Briefly, the effects doctrine says that if the effects of extraterritorial behavior or crimes adversely affect [[commerce]] or harm citizens within the United States, then jurisdiction in a U.S. court is permissible. The first case to establish the effects doctrine was ''[[United States v. Alcoa]]'', 148 F.2d 416 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|2d Cir.]] 1945) ([[Learned Hand]], J.).

The ALCOA case brought charges against a foreign [[consortium]] of [[aluminum]] traders and producers who had affected the price of raw aluminum and goods manufactured from aluminum in the United States through unfair trade practices of [[price fixing]] in violation of section 1 of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] ("every contract, combination ... or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal").&lt;ref&gt;''Alcoa'', 148 F.2d at 416.&lt;/ref&gt;
The effects doctrine has also been incorporated into § 402 of the ''Restatement of Foreign Relations Law of the United States'', Third: "a state has jurisdiction to prescribe law with respect to ... (c) conduct outside its territory that has or is intended to have substantial effect within its territory."

==''Raju'' case==
In one case, the decision to allow jurisdiction in a U.S. court over claims of [[copyright infringement]] and [[cybersquatting]] was premised on an effects doctrine theory of jurisdiction. ''Graduate Management Admission Council v. Raju'', 241 F.Supp.2d 589 ([[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia|E.D. Va.]], 2003). The defendant in ''Raju'' was a [[Indian nationality law|citizen of India]] who sold "official" past [[Graduate Record Examination]]s (GREs) to U.S. customers that were of dubious origin and in violation of the plaintiff, copyright-holder [[Graduate Management Admission Council]] (GMAC). These exams were advertised and [[Electronic commerce|sold over the Internet]].

The defendant never made an appearance on U.S. territory depriving the plaintiffs of one easy avenue of obtaining ''[[in personam]]'' jurisdiction over the defendant – the simple act of being able to [[Service of process|serve process]] on the defendant while the defendant is visiting and within the territory of the United States (this would be the traditional territorial principle of jurisdiction at work, to use terms of international law). The defendant was not a citizen of a particular [[U.S. state|state]]. The court described the jurisdiction it exercised over Raju's conduct of selling illegal copies of the exams to potential purchasers in several states within the territory of the U.S. as "targeting" the U.S. market for U.S. purchasers. Under these circumstances, the court found that personal jurisdiction was proper under a theory of '''national jurisdiction''': the defendant had targeted the U.S. at large from outside of the territory and intended to avail himself of the opportunity of selling test answers to a U.S. [[graduate school]] entrance test to his most likely customers: Americans.

A judgment was issued against the defendant Raju who [[Default (law)|defaulted]] by never making an appearance to the district court where he was being sued.

==Additional cases==
In a procedurally complicated case, ''[[Yahoo! Inc. v. La Ligue Contre Le Racisme et l'Antisemitisme (LICRA)]]'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th Circuit Court of Appeals]] held that it had personal jurisdiction over two French organizations who sued [[Yahoo!]] in a French court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/433/433.F3d.1199.01-17424.html 433 F.3d 1199&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that all of the following acts, in combination, were [[Minimum contacts|sufficient contacts]] to create personal jurisdiction over the French organizations: sending letters to Yahoo!, suing Yahoo! and serving Yahoo! in [[California]], and the suit resulting in orders that Yahoo!'s officers in California comply with French law.

[[Plasmonics]] is the study of [[plasmons]], [[quasiparticles]] of [[plasma oscillation]] in solids such as [[metal]]s, [[semi-metal]]s, [[metal oxide]]s, [[nitride]]s, doped [[semiconductor]]s, etc. An effort is currently being made to implement plasmons in [[electric circuit]]s, or in an electric circuit analog, to combine the size efficiency of electronics with the data capacity of [[photonic integrated circuit]]s.&lt;ref name="ebb"&gt;T. W. Ebbesen, C. Genet, S. I. Bozhevolnyi, "Surface-plasmon circuitry", Am. Inst. of   Phys., 44 - 50, (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Plasmonics can be understood as "light-on-metal-dielectric-interfaces,"&lt;ref name="maier"&gt;S.A. Maier, Plasmonics, Fundamentals and Applications (Springer, New York, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; where electrons oscillate at the surface of a metal due to strong resonant interactions with the electric field of incident light. Due to the high [[scattering]] rate of electrons, ohmic losses in plasmonic signals are generally large, which limits the signal transfer distances to the sub-centimeter range,&lt;ref name="barnes"&gt;W.L. Barnes 2006 J. Opt. A: Pure Appl. Opt. 8 S87&lt;/ref&gt; unless hybrid optoplasmonic light guiding networks,&lt;ref name="boris"&gt;Boriskina, S.V. &amp; B.M. Reinhard, Proc. Natl. Acad.

Boriskina, H. Ghasemi, and G. Chen, Materials Today, vol. 16, pp. 379-390, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and can be utilized to enhance weak optical effects of opto-electronic devices.

==Current Issues==
One of the biggest issues in making plasmonic circuits a feasible reality is the impractically short propagation length of surface plasmons. Typically, surface plasmons travel distances only on the scale of millimeters before damping diminishes the signal.&lt;ref name="bring"&gt;Brongersma, Mark. "Are Plasmonics Circuitry Wave of Future?" Stanford School of Engineering. N.p., n.d. Web. 26 Nov. 2014. &lt;http://engineering.stanford.edu/research-profile/mark-brongersma-mse&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely due to the unique dispersion relation of surface plasmons, which shows that as confinement increases, resistive damping increases; thus, propagation length decreases.&lt;ref name="ebb"/&gt; Researchers are attempting to reduce losses in surface plasmon propagation by examining a variety of materials and their respective properties.&lt;ref name="ekmel"&gt;Ozbay, E. "Plasmonics: Merging Photonics and Electronics at Nanoscale Dimensions." Science 311.5758 (2006): 189-93. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; New promising low-loss plasmonic materials include metal oxides and nitrides&lt;ref name="naik"&gt;Naik, G.V. et al, Opt. Mater. Express, 2011. 1(6): p. 1090-1099&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[graphene]].&lt;ref name="vakil"&gt;Vakil, A. &amp; Engheta, N. Science, 2011. 332(6035): pp. 1291-1294&lt;/ref&gt; Another foreseeable barrier plasmonic circuits will have to overcome is heat; heat in a plasmonic circuit may or may not exceed the heat generated by complex electronic circuits.&lt;ref name="bring"/&gt; It has recently been proposed to reduce heating in plasmonic networks by designing them to support trapped optical vortices, which circulate light powerflow through the inter-particle gaps thus reducing absorption and Ohmic heating,&lt;ref name="vortex1"&gt;S.V. Boriskina and B.M. Reinhard, Nanoscale, 4, 76-90, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vortex2"&gt;W. Ahn, S.V. Boriskina, Y. Hong, and B.M. Reinhard, Nano Lett., 12(1), 219–227, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vortex3"&gt; S.V. Boriskina "Plasmonics with a twist: taming optical tornadoes on the nanoscale," chapter 12 in:  Plasmonics: Theory and applications (T.V. Shahbazyan and M.I. Stockman Eds.) Springer 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to heat, it is also difficult to change the direction of a plasmonic signal in a circuit without significantly reducing its amplitude and propagation length.&lt;ref name="ebb"/&gt; One clever solution to the issue of bending the direction of propagation is the use of [[Bragg mirror]]s to angle the signal in a particular direction, or even to function as splitters of the signal.&lt;ref name="george"&gt;Veronis, Georgios, and Shanhui Fan.

Photonics 3, 220–224 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; leverage Ohmic losses in metals to obtain devices with new enhanced functionalities.

==Waveguiding==
Optimal plasmonic waveguide designs strive to maximize both the confinement and propagation length of surface plasmons within a plasmonic circuit.  Surface plasmon polaritons are characterized by a complex [[wave vector]], with components parallel and perpendicular to the metal-dielectric interface. The imaginary part of the wave vector component is inversely proportional to the SPP propagation length, while its real part defines the SPP confinement.&lt;ref name="volks"&gt;Sorger, Volker J., Rupert F. Oulton, Ren-Min Ma, and Xiang Zhang. "Toward Integrated Plasmonic Circuits." MRS Bulletin 37.08 (2012): 728-38. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The SPP dispersion characteristics depend on the dielectric constants of the materials comprising the waveguide. The propagation length and confinement of the surface plasmon polariton wave are inversely related. Therefore, stronger confinement of the mode typically results in shorter propagation lengths. The construction of a practical and usable surface plasmon circuit is heavily dependent on a compromise between propagation and confinement.   Maximizing both confinement and propagation length helps mitigate the drawbacks of choosing propagation length over confinement and vice versa.  Multiple types of waveguides have been created in pursuit of a plasmonic circuit with strong confinement and sufficient propagation length.   Some of the most common types include insulator-metal-insulator (IMI),&lt;ref&gt;E. Verhagen , M. Spasenovic , A. Polman , L. Kuipers , Phys. Rev. Lett. 102 ,

Aitchison, and M. Mojahedi, "A marriage of convenience: Hybridization
of plasmonic and dielectric waveguide modes," Laser and Photonics Review 8, 394 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coupling==
The input and output ports of a plasmonic circuit will receive and send optical signals, respectively. To do this, coupling and decoupling of the optical signal to the surface plasmon is necessary.&lt;ref name="krenn"&gt;J. R. Krenn, J. C. Weeber, Philos. Trans. R. Soc. London Ser. A 362, 739 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The dispersion relation for the surface plasmon lies entirely below the dispersion relation for light, which means that for coupling to occur additional momentum should be provided by the input coupler to achieve the momentum conservation between incoming light and surface plasmon polariton waves launched in the plasmonic circuit.&lt;ref name="ebb"/&gt; There are several solutions to this, including using dielectric prisms, gratings, or localized scattering elements on the surface of the metal to help induce coupling by matching the momenta of the incident light and the surface plasmons.&lt;ref name="gonzalez"&gt;González, M., J.-C. Weeber, A.-L. Baudrion, A. Dereux, A. Stepanov, J. Krenn, E. Devaux, and T. Ebbesen. "Design, Near-field Characterization, and Modeling of 45° Surface-plasmon Bragg Mirrors." Physical Review B 73.15 (2006): n. pag. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; After a surface plasmon has been created and sent to a destination, it can then be converted into an electrical signal. This can be achieved by using a photodetector in the metal plane, or decoupling the surface plasmon into freely propagating light that can then be converted into an electrical signal.&lt;ref name="ebb"/&gt; Alternatively, the signal can be out-coupled into a propagating mode of an optical fiber or waveguide.

==Active Devices==
The progress made in surface plasmons over the last 50 years has led to the development in various types of devices, both active and passive.  A few of the most prominent areas of active devices are optical, thermo-optical, and electro-optical.  All-optical devices have shown the capacity to become a viable source for information processing, communication, and data storage when used as a modulator.  In one instance, the interaction of two light beams of different wavelengths was demonstrated by converting them into co-propagating surface plasmons via [[cadmium selenide]] [[quantum dot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;D. Pacifici, H. J. Lezec, H. A. Atwater, Nat. Photonics 1, 402 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Electro-optical devices have combined aspects of both optical and electrical devices in the form of a modulator as well. Specifically, electro-optic modulators have been designed using evanescently coupled resonant metal gratings and nanowires that rely on long-range surface plasmons (LRSP).&lt;ref&gt;Z. Wu, R. L. Nelson, J. W. Haus, Q. Zhan, Optics Letters, 33 (60), 551 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, thermo-optic devices, which contain a dielectric material whose refractive index changes with variation in temperature, have also been used as interferometric modulators of SPP signals in addition to directional-coupler switches.  Some thermo-optic devices have been shown to utilize LRSP waveguiding along gold stripes that are embedded in a polymer and heated by electrical signals as a means for modulation and directional-coupler switches.&lt;ref&gt;T. Nikolajsen, K. Leosson, S. I. Bozhevolnyi, Appl. Phys. Lett. 85, 5833 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  Another potential field lies in the use of [[spaser]]s in areas such as nanoscale lithography, probing, and microscopy.&lt;ref name="stockman"&gt;M.I. Stockman, Nature Photonics 2, 327 - 329 (2008) doi:10.1038/nphoton.2008.85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passive Devices==
Although active components play an important role in the use of plasmonic circuitry, passive circuits are just as integral and, surprisingly, not trivial to make.  Many passive elements such as [[prism]]s, [[lens (optics)|lens]]es, and [[beam splitter]]s can be implemented in a plasmonic circuit, however fabrication at the nano scale has proven difficult and has adverse effects. Significant losses can occur due to decoupling in situations where a refractive element with a different refractive index is used.  However, some steps have been taken to minimize losses and maximize compactness of the photonic components.  One such step relies on the use of [[Bragg reflector]]s, or mirrors composed of a succession of planes to steer a surface plasmon beam. When optimized, Bragg reflectors can reflect nearly 100% of the incoming power.&lt;ref name="ebb"/&gt; Another method used to create compact photonic components relies on CPP waveguides as they have displayed strong confinement with acceptable losses less than 3&amp;nbsp;dB within telecommunication wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;Volkov, Valentyn S., Sergey I. Bozhevolnyi, Eloïse Devaux, and Thomas W. Ebbesen. "Compact Gradual Bends for Channel Plasmon Polaritons." Optics Express 14.10 (2006): 4494. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Maximizing loss and compactness with regards to the use of passive devices, as well as active devices, creates more potential for the use of plasmonic circuits.

==Properties==
The polymer is stable above about 80K.  Below this temperature the ε form of solid molecular CO is formed instead.  When the pressure is released the polymer remains stable at atmospheric pressure.  The solid dissolves in water, alcohol and acetone.&lt;ref name="Mills1984"/&gt; When exposed to the atmosphere it is hygroscopic, becomes gluey, and changes colour, becoming darker.&lt;ref name="Lipp2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lipp|first=Magnus J.|author2=William J.

The solid stores a high energy.  It can decompose explosively forming glassy carbon and carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name="Lipp2005"/&gt; The [[energy density]] stored can be up to 8&amp;nbsp;kJ/g. During the decomposition the temperature can be 2500K.&lt;ref name="Lipp2005"/&gt; The density is 1.65 gcm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, however most of the solid produced is porous, so the true density is likely to be higher.&lt;ref name="Lipp2005"/&gt;

Infrared spectroscopy shows bands at 650, 1210, 1440, 1650 and 1760&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.  The 1760 band is likely to be due to the -C-(C=O)-C- structure.&lt;ref name=Bernard/&gt; The 1600 is due to vibration of a C=C double bond.&lt;ref name="Lipp2005"/&gt;

The solid is electrically insulating with an electronic gap energy of 1.9&amp;nbsp;eV.&lt;ref name=Bernard/&gt;

[[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] for the material made from &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CO shows sharp resonance at 223 ppm due to ester or lactone attached carbon, and 151 ppm due to C=C double bonds. There is also broad resonance at 109 and 189 ppm. Over time of a few days, the 223 ppm peak reduces and all the other features increase in strength.&lt;ref name="Lipp2005"/&gt;

==Structure==
Ideas of the structure include a zig zag chain of CO pointing in opposite directions, or five atom rings connected by CO and C-C bonds. The rings are [[lactone]]s of [[tetronic acid]]: -C:-(C=O)-(C-O-)-(C=O)-O-. Interconnections between the rings are zig zags of CO.&lt;ref name=Bernard/&gt;

Other ideas of the structure of the solid, include graphitic carbon with carbon dioxide under pressure, and a polymer with this C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monomer: -(C=O)-O-(C-)=C&lt;. Yet other ideas are that the solid is the same as the polymer of [[carbon suboxide]] with [[oxalic anhydride]].&lt;ref name="Lipp1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lipp|first=M.|author2=W. J.

[[File:John Pride at the 2008 NRA Bianchi Cup.jpg|thumb|right|Bianchi Cup competitor John Pride operating a racegun]]

''Not to be confused with a [[starter's pistol]]''

A '''racegun''' is a type of [[handgun]], [[shotgun]], or [[rifle]] that has been modified for accuracy, speed, and reliability. Used primarily in [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] [[Action shooting|Action Pistol]] ([[The Bianchi Cup]]), [[United States Practical Shooting Association]] (USPSA)/[[International Practical Shooting Confederation]] (IPSC) and similar styles of competition, raceguns are typically based on common guns and modified to function the best within a certain set of rules, such as weight, size, and capacity requirements.

Typical modifications include a match-grade barrel fitted with a recoil compensator, electronic optical sights, match-grade hammer and sear, a tuned trigger, and "skeletonizing" (cutouts to reduce mass). In addition to the modifications aforementioned, a typical open class semi-automatic racegun specifically tailored for The Bianchi Cup open division has a "barricade shroud" that completely encircles the slide with "wings" attached to opposing sides, a "moving target scope mount" with a pivoting base adjustable for predetermined lead depending on the bullet's velocity and speed and direction of the moving target, and a form of grip extension that elevates the gun for better line of sight while shooting in the prone position. Depending upon the competition requirement, some raceguns are modified with reduced-weight recoil springs to allow the use of lightly loaded ammunition that is just barely powerful enough to cycle the gun's mechanism, in order to reduce recoil and permit a faster rate of fire. The [[Steel Challenge]] speed shooting championship is such an event, where in its early days a 120 power factor hit was required to activate the stop plate to stop the clock is now no longer necessary so that competitors can go faster than ever before. To prevent this, certain sanctioning bodies such as IPSC and USPSA require ammunition to meet specific [[Power factor (pistol)|power factors]].

Some organizing bodies in [[practical shooting]], like the [[International Defensive Pistol Association]] and the production division of The Bianchi Cup, ban most or all of the modifications that distinguish raceguns from stock firearms, as they feel that such extensive modifications have turned the sport into a technology race rather than a true contest of skill, and thus are no longer "practical," i.e., applicable to real-life self-defense shooting situations. In the case of The Bianchi Cup/NRA Action Pistol, this was also done to increase participation at the grassroots level in order to reduce the equipment cost associated with competing in the open division, which can run upwards of $3,500 USD or more on a Bianchi racegun as compared to a $400 to $1,000 stock gun. Many believe this new division, in addition to the newly implemented $100,000 cash prize award to the first production class shooter to break 1900 at the national championship in May, will hopefully increase participation that has seen a decline for the last two decades or so. It is the opinion of many experienced individuals involved in the sport that perfect scores of 1920 accompanied with nearly perfect [[Bullseye (shooting competition)#Records|X-counts]] achieved by the top one or two percent (which were mostly sponsored professional competition shooters and very dedicated Bianchi Cup "specialists" shooting their tricked out open guns) have discouraged many top shooters from other disciplines from giving this discipline a try, citing the difficulties of obtaining such results even with these specialized raceguns as being too big of a hurdle.

In fact, rockets work more efficiently in space than in an atmosphere. [[Multistage rocket]]s are capable of attaining [[escape velocity]] from Earth and therefore can achieve unlimited maximum altitude.  Compared with [[Airbreathing jet engine|airbreathing engines]], rockets are lightweight and powerful and capable of generating large accelerations. To control their flight, rockets rely on momentum, airfoils, [[Reaction control system|auxiliary reaction engines]], [[gimballed thrust]], [[Reaction wheel|momentum wheels]], [[Thrust vectoring|deflection of the exhaust stream]], propellant flow, [[Spin-stabilisation|spin]], and/or gravity.

Rockets for military and recreational uses date back to at least 13th century [[China]].&lt;ref name="NASAEARLY"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/rocketry/tl1.html |title=Rockets in Ancient Times (100 B.C. to 17th Century) |accessdate=2009-06-28 |publisher=NASA |work=A Timeline of Rocket History |author=MSFC History Office |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709042712/http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/rocketry/tl1.html |archivedate=2009-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant scientific, interplanetary and industrial use did not occur until the 20th century, when rocketry was the enabling technology for the [[Space Age]], including [[Apollo 11|setting foot on the Earth's moon]]. Rockets are now used for [[fireworks]], [[weapon]]ry, [[ejection seat]]s, [[launch vehicle]]s for [[artificial satellite]]s, [[human spaceflight]], and [[space exploration]].

[[Chemical rocket]]s are the most common type of high power rocket, typically creating a high speed exhaust by the [[combustion]] of [[rocket propellant|fuel]] with an [[oxidizer]]. The stored propellant can be a simple pressurized gas or a single [[liquid fuel]] that disassociates in the presence of a catalyst ([[monopropellant]]s), two liquids that spontaneously react on contact ([[hypergolic propellant]]s), two liquids that must be ignited to react, a solid combination of fuel with oxidizer ([[Solid-fuel rocket|solid fuel]]), or solid fuel with liquid oxidizer ([[Hybrid rocket|hybrid propellant system]]). Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form, and can be very dangerous. However, careful design, testing, construction and use minimizes risks.

==History==
{{main|History of rockets}}
{{further|Timeline of rocket and missile technology}}

The first [[gunpowder]]-powered rockets evolved in medieval China under the Song dynasty by the 13th century. The Mongols adopted Chinese rocket technology and the invention spread via the [[Mongol invasions]] to the Middle East and to Europe in the mid-13th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Rockets appear in Arab literature in 1258 A.D., describing Mongol invaders' use of them on February 15 to capture the city of Baghdad." {{cite web|url= http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/rocket-history.txt|title= A brief history of rocketry|work= NASA Spacelink|accessdate= 2006-08-19|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060805203537/http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/rocket-history.txt|archivedate= 2006-08-05|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rockets are recorded{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} in use  by the Song navy in a military exercise dated to 1245. Internal-combustion rocket propulsion is mentioned in a reference to 1264, recording that the "ground-rat", a type of [[firework]], had  frightened the Empress-Mother Gongsheng at a feast held in her honor by her son the [[Emperor Lizong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Crosby | first = Alfred W. | title = Throwing Fire: Projectile Technology Through History | year = 2002 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | isbn = 978-0521791588 | pages = 100–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, rockets are included in the military treatise ''[[Huolongjing]]'', also known as the Fire Drake Manual, written by the Chinese artillery officer [[Jiao Yu]] in the mid-14th century. This text mentions the first known [[multistage rocket]], the 'fire-dragon issuing from the water' (huo long chu shui), thought to have been used by the Chinese navy.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 510"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 510.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval and early modern rockets were used militarily as [[Incendiary device|incendiary weapons]] in [[siege]]s. Between 1270 and 1280, Hasan al-Rammah wrote ''al-furusiyyah wa al-manasib al-harbiyya'' (''The Book of Military Horsemanship and Ingenious War Devices''), which included 107 gunpowder recipes, 22 of them for rockets.&lt;ref name=Gunpowder&gt;{{cite web|last= Hassan |first= Ahmad Y |url =http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%202.htm |title= Gunpowder Composition for Rockets and Cannon in Arabic Military Treatises In Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries |accessdate= March 29, 2008 |authorlink= Ahmad Y Hassan |work= History of Science and Technology in Islam |year= |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080226105129/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%202.htm |archivedate= February 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

In Europe, [[Konrad Kyeser]] described rockets in his military treatise ''[[Bellifortis]]'' around 1405.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Riper|first1= A.

[[File:William Congreve at Copenhagen 1807.jpg|thumb|upright| [[Sir William Congreve, 2nd Baronet|William Congreve]] at the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|bombardment of Copenhagen]] (1807)]]
The name "rocket" comes from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''rocchetta'', meaning "bobbin" or "little spindle", given due to the similarity in shape to the bobbin or spool  used to hold the  thread to be fed to a spinning wheel.
[[Leonhard Fronsperger]] and [[Conrad Haas]] adopted the Italian term into German in the mid-16th century; "rocket" appears in English by the early 17th century.&lt;ref name="Bernhard" /&gt;
''Artis Magnae Artilleriae pars prima'', an important early modern work on [[rocket artillery]], by [[Kazimierz Siemienowicz]],  was first printed in [[Amsterdam]] in 1650.

The [[Mysorean rockets]] were the first successful iron-cased rockets, developed in the late 18th century in the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] (part of present-day [[India]]) by [[Tipu Sultan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.britannica.com/technology/rocket-and-missile-system|title= rocket and missile system {{!}} weapons system|work= Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date= 2017-10-29|language= en|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171031034251/https://www.britannica.com/technology/rocket-and-missile-system|archivedate= 2017-10-31|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Congreve rocket]] was a [[United Kingdom|British]] weapon designed and developed by [[William Congreve (inventor)|Sir William Congreve]] in 1804. This rocket was based directly on the Mysorean rockets, used compressed powder and was fielded in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It was Congreve rockets that [[Francis Scott Key]] was referring to when he wrote of the "rockets' red glare" while held captive on a British ship that was laying siege to [[Fort McHenry]] in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/rockets-inspired-francis-scott-key-180952399/ The Rockets That Inspired Francis Scott Key]&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the Mysorean and British innovations increased the effective range of military rockets from 100 to 2,000 yards.

The first mathematical treatment of the dynamics of rocket propulsion is due to [[William Moore (British mathematician)|William Moore]] (1813). In 1815 [[Alexander Dmitrievich Zasyadko]] constructed rocket-launching platforms, which allowed rockets to be fired in [[salvo]]s (6 rockets at a time), and gun-laying devices. [[William Hale (British inventor)|William Hale]] in 1844 greatly increased the accuracy of rocket artillery. [[Edward Mounier Boxer]] further improved the Congreve rocket in 1865.

[[William Leitch (scientist)|William Leitch]] first proposed the concept of using rockets to enable human spaceflight in 1861 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leitch |first1=William |title=God's Glory in the Heavens |date=1862 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vuAUAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=a+journey+through+space+leitch#v=onepage&amp;q=rocket&amp;f=false |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] later (in 1903) also conceived this idea, and extensively developed a body of theory that has provided the foundation for subsequent spaceflight development. [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]] in 1920 published proposed improvements to rocket technology in ''[[A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes]]''.  In 1923, [[Hermann Oberth]] (1894–1989) published ''Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen'' ("The Rocket into Planetary Space")

[[File:Goddard and Rocket.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Goddard with a liquid oxygen-gasoline rocket (1926)]]

Modern rockets originated in 1926 when Goddard attached a [[supersonic]] ([[de Laval nozzle|de Laval]]) nozzle to the [[combustion chamber]] of a [[liquid-propellant rocket]]. These nozzles turn the hot gas from the combustion chamber into a cooler, [[hypersonic]], highly directed jet of gas, more than doubling the thrust and raising the engine efficiency from 2% to 64%.
Use of [[liquid propellant]]s instead of [[gunpowder]] greatly improved the effectiveness of rocket artillery in [[World War II]], and opened up the possibility of  [[manned spaceflight]] after 1945.

In 1943 production of the [[V-2 rocket]] began in Germany.
In parallel with the German [[guided-missile]] programme,  rockets were also used on [[aircraft]], either for assisting horizontal take-off ([[JATO|RATO]]), vertical take-off ([[Bachem Ba 349]] "Natter") or for powering them ([[Me 163]], see [[list of World War II guided missiles of Germany]]). The Allies' rocket programs were less technological, relying mostly on unguided missiles like the Soviet [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha rocket]].
The Americans captured a large number of German [[rocket scientist]]s, including [[Wernher von Braun]], in 1945, and brought them to the United States as part of [[Operation Paperclip]]. After World War II scientists used rockets to study high-altitude conditions, by radio [[telemetry]] of temperature and pressure of the atmosphere, detection of [[cosmic rays]], and further techniques; note too the [[Bell X-1]], the first manned vehicle to break the [[sound barrier]] (1947). Independently, in the  [[Soviet space program|Soviet Union's space program]] research continued under the [[leadership]] of the chief designer [[Sergei Korolev]] (1907–1966).

During the [[Cold War]] rockets became extremely important militarily with the development of modern [[intercontinental ballistic missiles]] (ICBMs).
The 1960s saw rapid development of rocket technology, particularly in the Soviet Union ([[Vostok rocket|Vostok]], [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz]], [[Proton rocket|Proton]]) and in the United States (e.g. the [[X-15]]). Rockets came into use for [[space exploration]]. American manned programs ([[Project Mercury]], [[Project Gemini]] and later the [[Apollo programme]]) culminated in 1969 with the first manned  [[moon landing|landing on the moon]] – using equipment launched by the [[Saturn V]] rocket.

==Design==
A rocket design can be as simple as a cardboard tube filled with [[black powder]], but to make an efficient, accurate rocket or missile involves overcoming a number of difficult problems. The main difficulties include cooling the combustion chamber, pumping the fuel (in the case of a liquid fuel), and controlling and correcting the direction of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author= Richard B. Dow | title=Fundamentals of Advanced Missiles |year=1958 |location=Washington (DC) |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |id=loc 58-13458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Components===
Rockets consist of a [[rocket propellant|propellant]], a place to put propellant (such as a [[propellant tank]]), and a [[rocket engine nozzle|nozzle]]. They may also have one or more [[rocket engine]]s, [[attitude control|directional stabilization device(s)]] (such as [[fins]], [[vernier engine]]s or engine [[gimbal]]s for [[thrust vectoring]], [[gyroscope]]s) and a structure (typically [[monocoque]]) to hold these components together. Rockets intended for high speed atmospheric use also have an [[aerodynamic]] fairing such as a [[nose cone]], which usually holds the payload.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=United States Congress. House Select Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration |title=Space handbook: Astronautics and its applications : Staff report of the Select Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/conghand/spcover.htm |chapter=4. Rocket Vehicles |chapterurl=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/conghand/vehicles.htm |series=House document / 86th Congress, 1st session, no. 86 |year=1959 |location=Washington (DC) |publisher=U.S. G.P.O. |oclc=52368435 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618163819/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/conghand/spcover.htm |archivedate=2009-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as these components, rockets can have any number of other components, such as wings ([[rocketplane]]s), [[parachute]]s, wheels ([[rocket car]]s), even, in a sense, a person ([[rocket belt]]). Vehicles frequently possess [[Automotive navigation system|navigation systems]] and [[guidance system]]s that typically use [[satellite navigation]] and [[inertial navigation system]]s.

===Engines===
{{Main|Rocket engine}}
[[File:Viking 5C rocketengine.jpg|thumb|upright|Viking 5C rocket engine]]
Rocket engines employ the principle of [[jet engine|jet propulsion]].&lt;ref name="RPE7"/&gt; The rocket engines powering rockets come in a great variety of different types; a comprehensive list can be found in [[rocket engine]]. Most current rockets are chemically powered rockets (usually [[internal combustion engines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Charles Lafayette Proctor II |url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9368065/internal-combustion-engine |title=internal combustion engines |publisher=Concise Britannica |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114004538/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9368065/internal-combustion-engine |archivedate=2008-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but some employ a decomposing [[monopropellant]]) that emit a hot [[exhaust gas]]. A rocket engine can use gas propellants, [[Solid-fuel rocket|solid propellant]], [[liquid rocket|liquid propellant]], or a [[hybrid rocket|hybrid mixture of both solid and liquid]]. Some rockets use heat or pressure that is supplied from a source other than the [[chemical reaction]] of propellant(s), such as [[steam rocket]]s, [[solar thermal rocket]]s, [[nuclear thermal rocket]] engines or simple pressurized rockets such as [[water rocket]] or [[cold gas thruster]]s. With combustive propellants a chemical reaction is initiated between the [[fuel]] and the [[oxidizer]] in the [[combustion]] chamber, and the resultant hot gases accelerate out of a [[rocket engine nozzle]] (or [[nozzle]]s) at the rearward-facing end of the rocket. The [[acceleration]] of these gases through the engine exerts force ("thrust") on the combustion chamber and nozzle, propelling the vehicle (according to [[Newton's Third Law]]). This actually happens because the force (pressure times area) on the combustion chamber wall is unbalanced by the nozzle opening; this is not the case in any other direction. The shape of the nozzle also generates force by directing the exhaust gas along the axis of the rocket.&lt;ref name="RPE7"/&gt;

===Propellant===
{{Main|Rocket propellant}}
[[File:Gas Core light bulb.png|thumb|Gas Core light bulb]]
Rocket propellant is mass that is stored, usually in some form of [[propellant]] tank or casing, prior to being used as the propulsive mass that is ejected from a [[rocket engine]] in the form of a [[fluid]] [[jet (fluid)|jet]] to produce [[thrust]].&lt;ref name="RPE7"/&gt; For chemical rockets often the propellants are a fuel such as [[liquid hydrogen]] or [[kerosene]] burned with an oxidizer such as [[liquid oxygen]] or [[nitric acid]] to produce large volumes of very hot gas. The oxidiser is either kept separate and mixed in the combustion chamber, or comes premixed, as with solid rockets.

Sometimes the propellant is not burned but still undergoes a chemical reaction, and can be a 'monopropellant' such as [[hydrazine]], [[nitrous oxide]] or [[hydrogen peroxide]] that can be [[catalyst|catalytically]] decomposed to hot gas.

Alternatively, an inert propellant can be used that can be externally heated, such as in [[steam rocket]], [[solar thermal rocket]] or [[nuclear thermal rocket]]s.&lt;ref name="RPE7"/&gt;

For smaller, low performance rockets such as [[attitude control thruster]]s where high performance is less necessary, a pressurised fluid is used as propellant that simply escapes the spacecraft through a propelling nozzle.&lt;ref name="RPE7"/&gt;

==Uses==
Rockets or other similar [[reaction engine|reaction devices]] carrying their own propellant must be used when there is no other substance (land, water, or air) or force ([[gravity]], [[magnetism]], [[light]]) that a [[vehicle]] may usefully employ for propulsion, such as in space. In these circumstances, it is necessary to carry all the [[propellant]] to be used.

However, they are also useful in other situations:

===Military===
{{main|Missile}}
[[File:Trident II missile image.jpg|upright|thumb|A [[Trident (missile)|Trident II missile]] launched from sea.]]

Some military weapons use rockets to propel [[warhead]]s to their targets. A rocket and its payload together are generally referred to as a ''[[missile]]'' when the weapon has a [[guidance system]] (not all missiles use rocket engines, some use other engines such as [[jet engine|jets]]) or as a ''[[rocket (weapon)|rocket]]'' if it is unguided. Anti-tank and [[Surface-to-air missile|anti-aircraft missiles]] use rocket engines to engage targets at high speed at a range of several miles, while intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver [[multiple nuclear warheads]] from thousands of miles, and [[anti-ballistic missile]]s try to stop them. Rockets have also been tested for [[reconnaissance]], such as the [[Ping-Pong (rocket)|Ping-Pong rocket]], which was launched to surveil enemy targets, however, recon rockets have never come into wide use in the military.

===Science and research===
[[File:Bumper.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Bumper (rocket)|Bumper]] sounding rocket]]
{{See also| Space probe}}
[[Sounding rocket]]s are commonly used to carry instruments that take readings from {{convert|50|km|mi|sp=us}} to {{convert|1500|km|mi|sp=us}} above the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Elaine|last1=Marconi:KSC|title=NASA – What is a Sounding Rocket?|url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/f_sounding.html|website=www.nasa.gov|accessdate=28 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602020154/http://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/f_sounding.html|archivedate=2 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocket engines are also used to propel [[rocket sled]]s along a rail at extremely high speed. The world record for this is Mach 8.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Test sets world land speed record |url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123004755 |publisher=www.af.mil |accessdate=2008-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601084727/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123004755 |archivedate=June 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spaceflight===
{{Main| Spaceflight}}

Larger rockets are normally launched from a [[launch pad]] that provides stable support until a few seconds after ignition. Due to their high exhaust velocity—{{convert|2500|to|4500|m/s|km/h mph|abbr=on}}—rockets are particularly useful when very high speeds are required, such as orbital speed at approximately {{convert|7800|m/s|km/h mph|abbr=on}}. Spacecraft delivered into orbital trajectories become [[artificial satellites]], which are used for many commercial purposes. Indeed, rockets remain the only way to launch [[spacecraft]] into orbit and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/tracking/index.html |title=Spaceflight Now-worldwide launch schedule |publisher=Spaceflightnow.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911172414/http://spaceflightnow.com/tracking/index.html |archivedate=2013-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used to rapidly accelerate spacecraft when they change orbits or de-orbit for [[landing]]. Also, a rocket may be used to soften a hard parachute landing immediately before touchdown (see [[retrorocket]]).

===Rescue===
[[File:Apollo Pad Abort Test -2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Apollo LES [[pad abort test]] with [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] crew module.]]
Rockets were used to propel a line to a stricken ship so that a [[Breeches buoy]] can be used to [[rescue]] those on board. Rockets are also used to launch [[emergency flare]]s.

Some crewed rockets, notably the [[Saturn V]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apollosaturn.com/asnr/escape.htm |title=Apollo launch escape subsystem |publisher=ApolloSaturn |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716192337/http://www.apollosaturn.com/asnr/escape.htm |archivedate=2012-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Soyuz (rocket)|Soyuz]]&lt;ref name=soyuzt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/soyzt101.htm |title=Soyuz T-10-1 "Launch vehicle blew up on pad at Tyuratam; crew saved by abort system" |publisher=Astronautix.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805134401/http://astronautix.com/flights/soyzt101.htm |archivedate=2014-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; have [[launch escape system]]s. This is a small, usually solid rocket that is capable of pulling the crewed capsule away from the main vehicle towards safety at a moments notice. These types of systems have been operated several times, both in testing and in flight, and operated correctly each time.

This was the case when the [[Launch escape system|Safety Assurance System]] (Soviet nomenclature) successfully pulled away the L3 capsule during three of the four failed launches of the Soviet moon rocket, [[N1 (rocket)|N1]] vehicles [[N1 (rocket)#Launch history|3L, 5L and 7L]]. In all three cases the capsule, albeit unmanned, was saved from destruction. It should be noted that only the three aforementioned N1 rockets had functional Safety Assurance Systems. The outstanding vehicle, [[N1 (rocket)#Launch history|6L]], had dummy upper stages and therefore no escape system giving the N1 booster a 100% success rate for egress from a failed launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wade|first1=Mark|title=N1 Manned Lunar Launch Vehicle|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/n1.htm|website=astronautix.com|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=24 June 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65CDcGiQS?url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/n1.htm|archivedate=4 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wade |first1=Mark |title=N1 5L launch – 1969.07.03 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/details/n15h5170.htm |website=astronautix.com |publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica |accessdate=24 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150727072221/http://www.astronautix.com/details/n15h5170.htm |archivedate=27 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harvey|first1=Brian|title=Soviet and Russian lunar exploration|date=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-0387739762|page=226|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVeY7vMCtOkC&amp;pg=PA226#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427054220/https://books.google.com/books?id=nVeY7vMCtOkC&amp;pg=PA226#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=27 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=N1 (vehicle 5L) moon rocket Test – launch abort system activated|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoBHBOnscY&amp;noredirect=1|website=YouTube.com|publisher=2015 YouTube, LLC|accessdate=12 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517160815/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoBHBOnscY&amp;noredirect=1|archivedate=17 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hobby, sport, and entertainment===
{{Expand section|date=May 2016}}
Hobbyists build and fly a wide variety of [[model rocket]]s. Many companies produce model rocket kits and parts but due to their inherent simplicity some hobbyists have been known to make rockets out of almost anything. Rockets are also used in some types of consumer and professional [[fireworks]]. [[Water rocket|A Water Powered Rocket]] is a type of model rocket using water as its reaction mass. The pressure vessel (the engine of the rocket) is usually a used plastic soft drink bottle. The water is forced out by a pressurized gas, typically compressed air. It is an example of Newton's third law of motion.

The scale of amateur rocketry can range from a small rocket launched in one's own backyard to a rocket that reached space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coloradospacenews.com/csxt-go-fast-rocket-confirms-multiple-world-records/|title=CSXT GO FAST!

Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States have high power rocket associations which provide certifications to its members to fly different rocket motor sizes. While joining these organizations is not a requirement, they often provide insurance and flight waivers for their members.

Rocket exhaust generates a significant amount of acoustic energy. As the [[supersonic]] exhaust collides with the ambient air, [[shock wave]]s are formed. The [[sound intensity]] from these shock waves depends on the size of the rocket as well as the exhaust velocity. The sound intensity of large, high performance rockets could potentially kill at close range.&lt;ref name="CR566-3"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Potter |first1=R.C |last2=Crocker |first2=M.J |title=Acoustic Prediction Methods for Rocket Engines, Including the Effects of Clustered Engines and Deflected Exhaust Flow, CR-566 |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660030602_1966030602.pdf |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=NASA |year=1966 |oclc=37049198 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206122446/http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660030602_1966030602.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-06 |df= }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These acoustic waves can be so severe that they can destroy the rocket.

Noise is generally most intense when a rocket is close to the ground, since the noise from the engines radiates up away from the jet, as well as reflecting off the ground. This noise can be reduced somewhat by flame trenches with roofs, by water injection around the jet and by deflecting the jet at an angle.&lt;ref name="CR566-3"/&gt;

For crewed rockets various methods are used to reduce the sound intensity for the passengers, and typically the placement of the astronauts far away from the rocket engines helps significantly. For the passengers and crew, when a vehicle goes [[supersonic]] the sound cuts off as the sound waves are no longer able to keep up with the vehicle.&lt;ref name="CR566-3"/&gt;

===Operation===
[[File:A balloon with a tapering nozzle.png|thumb|upright|A balloon with a tapering nozzle. In this case, the nozzle itself does not push the balloon but is pulled by it. A convergent/divergent nozzle would be better.]]
{{Main|Rocket engine}}

The [[Reaction (physics)|effect]] of the combustion of propellant in the rocket engine is to increase the velocity of the resulting gases to very high speeds, hence producing a thrust.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}{{dubious|reason=so we don't need a nozzle then?|date=February 2016}} Initially, the gases of combustion are sent in every direction, but only those that produce a net thrust have any effect.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}{{dubious|reason=really, send them in all directions do we?|date=February 2016}} The ideal direction of motion of the exhaust is in the direction so as to cause thrust. At the top end of the combustion chamber the hot, energetic gas fluid cannot move forward, and so, it pushes upward against the top of the rocket engine's [[combustion chamber]]. As the combustion gases approach the exit of the combustion chamber, they increase in speed. The effect of the [[Rocket engine nozzle|convergent]] part of the rocket engine nozzle on the high pressure fluid of combustion gases, is to cause the gases to accelerate to high speed. The higher the speed of the gases, the lower the pressure of the gas ([[Bernoulli's principle]] or [[conservation of energy]]) acting on that part of the combustion chamber. In a properly designed engine, the flow will reach Mach 1 at the throat of the nozzle. At which point the speed of the flow increases. Beyond the throat of the nozzle, a bell shaped expansion part of the engine allows the gases that are expanding to push against that part of the rocket engine. Thus, the bell part of the nozzle gives additional thrust. Simply expressed, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, according to [[Newton's third law]] with the result that the exiting gases produce the reaction of a force on the rocket causing it to accelerate the rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren|first1=J.

The hose is acting like a rocket engine. The hose is throwing water in one direction, and the firefighters are using their strength and weight to counteract the reaction. If they were to let go of the hose, it would thrash around with tremendous force. If the firefighters were all standing on skateboards, the hose would propel them backward at great speed!”|group=nb}}

[[File:Rocket thrust.svg|thumb|right|Rocket thrust is caused by pressures acting on both the combustion chamber and nozzle]]
In a closed chamber, the pressures are equal in each direction and no acceleration occurs. If an opening is provided in the bottom of the chamber then the pressure is no longer acting on the missing section. This opening permits the exhaust to escape. The remaining pressures give a resultant thrust on the side opposite the opening, and these pressures are what push the rocket along.

The shape of the nozzle is important. Consider a balloon propelled by air coming out of a tapering nozzle. In such a case the combination of air pressure and viscous friction is such that the nozzle does not push the balloon but is ''pulled'' by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren|first1=J. W.|title=Understanding force : an account of some aspects of teaching the idea of force in school, college and university courses in engineering, mathematics and science|date=1979|publisher=Murray|location=London|isbn=978-0719535642|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a convergent/divergent nozzle gives more force since the exhaust also presses on it as it expands outwards, roughly doubling the total force. If propellant gas is continuously added to the chamber then these pressures can be maintained for as long as propellant remains. Note that in the case of liquid propellant engines, the pumps moving the propellant into the combustion chamber must maintain a pressure larger than the combustion chamber – typically on the order of 100 atmospheres.&lt;ref name="RPE7"/&gt;

As a side effect, these pressures on the rocket also act on the exhaust in the opposite direction and accelerate this exhaust to very high speeds (according to [[Newton's Third Law]]).&lt;ref name="RPE7"/&gt; From the principle of [[conservation of momentum]] the speed of the exhaust of a rocket determines how much momentum increase is created for a given amount of propellant. This is called the rocket's ''[[specific impulse]]''.&lt;ref name="RPE7"/&gt; Because a rocket, propellant and exhaust in flight, without any external perturbations, may be considered as a closed system, the total momentum is always constant. Therefore, the faster the net speed of the exhaust in one direction, the greater the speed of the rocket can achieve in the opposite direction. This is especially true since the rocket body's mass is typically far lower than the final total exhaust mass.

===Forces on a rocket in flight===
[[File:Rktfor.gif|thumb|upright|Forces on a rocket in flight]]
The general study of the [[force]]s on a rocket is part of the field of [[ballistics]]. Spacecraft are further studied in the subfield of [[astrodynamics]].

Flying rockets are primarily affected by the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/VirtualAero/BottleRocket/airplane/rktfor.html |title=NASA – Four forces on a model rocket |publisher=Grc.nasa.gov |date=2000-09-19 |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129204215/http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/VirtualAero/BottleRocket/airplane/rktfor.html |archivedate=2012-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thrust]] from the engine(s)
* [[Gravity]] from [[celestial bodies]]
* [[Drag (physics)|Drag]] if moving in atmosphere
* [[Lift (force)|Lift]]; usually relatively small effect except for [[rocket-powered aircraft]]

Rockets that must travel through the air are usually tall and thin as this shape gives a high [[ballistic coefficient]] and minimizes drag losses.

In addition, the [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|inertia and centrifugal pseudo-force]] can be significant due to the path of the rocket around the center of a celestial body; when high enough speeds in the right direction and altitude are achieved a stable [[orbit]] or [[escape velocity]] is obtained.

These forces, with a stabilizing tail (the ''[[empennage]]'') present will, unless deliberate control efforts are made, naturally cause the vehicle to follow a roughly [[parabola|parabolic]] trajectory termed a [[gravity turn]], and this trajectory is often used at least during the initial part of a [[rocket launch|launch]]. (This is true even if the rocket engine is [[Pendulum rocket fallacy|mounted at the nose]].) Vehicles can thus maintain low or even zero [[angle of attack]], which minimizes transverse [[stress (physics)|stress]] on the launch vehicle, permitting a weaker, and hence lighter, launch vehicle.&lt;ref name=space-sourcebook&gt;{{cite book|first1=Samuel|last1=Glasstone|title=Sourcebook on the Space Sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K6k0AAAAMAAJ|publisher=D.

====Drag====
{{main|Drag (physics)|Gravity drag|Aerodynamic drag}}
Drag is a force opposite to the direction of the rocket's motion. This decreases acceleration of the vehicle and produces structural loads. Deceleration force for fast-moving rockets are calculated using the [[drag equation]].

Drag can be minimised by an aerodynamic [[nose cone]] and by using a shape with a high ballistic coefficient (the "classic" rocket shape—long and thin), and by keeping the rocket's [[angle of attack]] as low as possible.

During a rocket launch, as the vehicle speed increases, and the atmosphere thins, there is a point of maximum aerodynamic drag called [[Max Q]]. This determines the minimum aerodynamic strength of the vehicle, as the rocket must avoid [[buckling]] under these forces.&lt;ref name=maxq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/aerodynamics/q0025.shtml |title=Space Shuttle Max-Q |publisher=Aerospaceweb |date=2001-05-06 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Net thrust====
[[File:Rocket nozzle expansion.svg|thumb|upright|[[Rocket engine#Nozzle|A rocket jet shape]] varies based on external air pressure. From top to bottom: Underexpanded&lt;br /&gt;Ideally Expanded&lt;br /&gt;Overexpanded&lt;br /&gt;Grossly overexpanded]]

{{For|a more detailed model of the net thrust of a rocket engine that includes the effect of atmospheric pressure|Rocket_engine#Net_thrust}}
A typical rocket engine can handle a significant fraction of its own mass in propellant each second, with the propellant leaving the nozzle at several kilometres per second. This means that the [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] of a rocket engine, and often the entire vehicle can be very high, in extreme cases over 100. This compares with other jet propulsion engines that can exceed 5 for some of the better&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geae.com/engines/military/j85/index.html |title=General Electric J85 |publisher=Geae.com |date=2012-09-07 |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722155949/http://www.geae.com/engines/military/j85/index.html |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thrustssc.com/thrustssc/Club/Secure/Arfons_Last_Stand.html |title=Mach 1 Club |publisher=Thrust SSC |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617103717/http://www.thrustssc.com/thrustssc/Club/Secure/Arfons_Last_Stand.html |archivedate=2016-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be shown that the net thrust of a rocket is:

:&lt;math&gt;F_n = \dot{m}\;v_{e}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="RPE7"/&gt;{{rp|2–14}}

where:

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{m} =\,&lt;/math&gt;propellant flow (kg/s or lb/s)

:&lt;math&gt;v_{e} =\,&lt;/math&gt;the [[effective exhaust velocity]] (m/s or ft/s)

The effective exhaust velocity &lt;math&gt;v_{e}&lt;/math&gt; is more or less the speed the exhaust leaves the vehicle, and in the vacuum of space, the effective exhaust velocity is often equal to the actual average exhaust speed along the thrust axis. However, the effective exhaust velocity allows for various losses, and notably, is reduced when operated within an atmosphere.

The rate of propellant flow through a rocket engine is often deliberately varied over a flight, to provide a way to control the thrust and thus the airspeed of the vehicle. This, for example, allows minimization of aerodynamic losses&lt;ref name=maxq/&gt; and can limit the increase of [[g-force|''g''-forces]] due to the reduction in propellant load.

===Total impulse===
{{Main|Impulse (physics)}}
Impulse is defined as a force acting on an object over time, which in the absence of opposing forces (gravity and aerodynamic drag), changes the [[momentum]] (integral of mass and velocity) of the object. As such, it is the best performance class (payload mass and terminal velocity capability) indicator of a rocket, rather than takeoff thrust, mass, or "power". The total impulse of a rocket (stage) burning its propellant is:&lt;ref name="RPE7"/&gt;{{rp|27}}

:&lt;math&gt;I = \int F dt&lt;/math&gt;

When there is fixed thrust, this is simply:

:&lt;math&gt;I = F t\;&lt;/math&gt;

The total impulse of a multi-stage rocket is the sum of the impulses of the individual stages.
{{Clear}}

===Specific impulse===
{{Main|specific impulse}}
{{Specific impulse|align=right}}
As can be seen from the thrust equation, the effective speed of the exhaust controls the amount of thrust produced from a particular quantity of fuel burnt per second.

An equivalent measure, the net impulse per weight unit of propellant expelled, is called [[Specific impulse|specific Impulse]], &lt;math&gt;I_{sp}&lt;/math&gt;, and this is one of the most important figures that describes a rocket's performance. It is defined such that it is related to the effective exhaust velocity by:

:&lt;math&gt;v_e = I_{sp} \cdot g_0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="RPE7"/&gt;{{rp|29}}

where:
:&lt;math&gt;I_{sp}&lt;/math&gt; has units of seconds
:&lt;math&gt;g_0&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration at the surface of the Earth

Thus, the greater the specific impulse, the greater the net thrust and performance of the engine. &lt;math&gt;I_{sp}&lt;/math&gt; is determined by measurement while testing the engine. In practice the effective exhaust velocities of rockets varies but can be extremely high, ~4500&amp;nbsp;m/s, about 15 times the sea level speed of sound in air.

===Delta-v (rocket equation)===
[[File:Delta-Vs for inner Solar System.svg|thumb|upright|A map of approximate [[Delta-v]]'s around the solar system between Earth and [[Mars]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pma.caltech.edu/~chirata/deltav.html |title=table of cislunar/mars delta-vs |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701211813/http://www.pma.caltech.edu/~chirata/deltav.html |archivedate=2007-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.strout.net/info/science/delta-v/intro.html |title=cislunar delta-vs |publisher=Strout.net |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000312041150/http://www.strout.net/info/science/delta-v/intro.html |archivedate=2000-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

{{Main|Tsiolkovsky rocket equation}}
The [[delta-v]] capacity of a rocket is the theoretical total change in velocity that a rocket can achieve without any external interference (without air drag or gravity or other forces).

When &lt;math&gt;v_e&lt;/math&gt; is constant, the delta-v that a rocket vehicle can provide can be calculated from the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projectrho.com/rocket/rocket3c.html |title=Choose Your Engine |publisher=Projectrho.com |date=2012-06-01 |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529042131/http://www.projectrho.com/rocket/rocket3c.html |archivedate=2010-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta v\ = v_e \ln \frac {m_0} {m_1}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial total mass, including propellant, in kg (or lb)
:&lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; is the final total mass in kg (or lb)
:&lt;math&gt;v_e&lt;/math&gt; is the effective exhaust velocity in m/s (or ft/s)
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta v\ &lt;/math&gt; is the delta-v in m/s (or ft/s)

When launched from the Earth practical delta-vs for a single rockets carrying payloads can be a few km/s. Some theoretical designs have rockets with delta-vs over 9&amp;nbsp;km/s.

The required delta-v can also be calculated for a particular manoeuvre; for example the delta-v to launch from the surface of the Earth to [[Low earth orbit]] is about 9.7&amp;nbsp;km/s, which leaves the vehicle with a sideways speed of about 7.8&amp;nbsp;km/s at an altitude of around 200&amp;nbsp;km. In this manoeuvre about 1.9&amp;nbsp;km/s is lost in [[air drag]], [[gravity drag]] and [[potential energy|gaining altitude]].

The ratio &lt;math&gt;\frac {m_0} {m_1}&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes called the ''mass ratio''.

===Mass ratios===
[[File:Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.svg|thumb|The Tsiolkovsky rocket equation gives a relationship between the mass ratio and the final velocity in multiples of the exhaust speed]]

{{Main|mass ratio}}
Almost all of a launch vehicle's mass consists of propellant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Srockhis.htm |title=The Evolution of Rockets |publisher=Istp.gsfc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108191716/http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Srockhis.htm |archivedate=2013-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass ratio is, for any 'burn', the ratio between the rocket's initial mass and its final mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/rktwtp.html |title=Rocket Mass Ratios |publisher=Exploration.grc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216063603/http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/rktwtp.html |archivedate=2013-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Everything else being equal, a high mass ratio is desirable for good performance, since it indicates that the rocket is lightweight and hence performs better, for essentially the same reasons that low weight is desirable in sports cars.

Rockets as a group have the highest [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] of any type of engine; and this helps vehicles achieve high [[mass ratio]]s, which improves the performance of flights. The higher the ratio, the less engine mass is needed to be carried. This permits the carrying of even more propellant, enormously improving the delta-v. Alternatively, some rockets such as for rescue scenarios or racing carry relatively little propellant and payload and thus need only a lightweight structure and instead achieve high accelerations. For example, the Soyuz escape system can produce 20g.&lt;ref name=soyuzt/&gt;

Achievable mass ratios are highly dependent on many factors such as propellant type, the design of engine the vehicle uses, structural safety margins and construction techniques.

The highest mass ratios are generally achieved with liquid rockets, and these types are usually used for [[orbital launch vehicle]]s, a situation which calls for a high delta-v. Liquid propellants generally have densities similar to water (with the notable exceptions of [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[Liquid methane rocket fuel|liquid methane]]), and these types are able to use lightweight, low pressure tanks and typically run high-performance [[turbopumps]] to force the propellant into the combustion chamber.

Some notable mass fractions are found in the following table (some aircraft are included for comparison purposes):

{{Mass fraction table}}

===Staging===
[[File:Artistsconcept separation.jpg|thumb|Spacecraft staging involves dropping off unnecessary parts of the rocket to reduce mass.]]
[[File:Ap6-68-HC-191.jpg|thumb|[[Apollo 6]] while dropping the interstage ring]]
{{Main|Multistage rocket}}
Thus far, the required velocity (delta-v) to achieve orbit has been unattained by any single rocket because the [[propellant]], tankage, structure, [[guidance system|guidance]], valves and engines and so on, take a particular minimum percentage of take-off mass that is too great for the propellant it carries to achieve that delta-v carrying reasonable payloads. Since [[Single-stage-to-orbit]] has so far not been achievable, orbital rockets always have more than one stage.

For example, the first stage of the Saturn V, carrying the weight of the upper stages, was able to achieve a [[mass ratio]] of about 10, and achieved a specific impulse of 263 seconds. This gives a delta-v of around 5.9&amp;nbsp;km/s whereas around 9.4&amp;nbsp;km/s delta-v is needed to achieve orbit with all losses allowed for.

This problem is frequently solved by [[staging (rocketry)|staging]]—the rocket sheds excess weight (usually empty tankage and associated engines) during launch. Staging is either ''serial'' where the rockets light after the previous stage has fallen away, or ''parallel'', where rockets are burning together and then detach when they burn out.&lt;ref name="NASAstaging"&gt;{{cite web |author=NASA |url=https://spaceflightsystems.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/rktstage.html |title=Rocket staging |accessdate=2016-05-28 |publisher=NASA |work=Beginner's Guide to Rockets |year=2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602123849/https://spaceflightsystems.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/rktstage.html |archivedate=2016-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maximum speeds that can be achieved with staging is theoretically limited only by the speed of light. However the payload that can be carried goes down geometrically with each extra stage needed, while the additional delta-v for each stage is simply additive.

===Acceleration and thrust-to-weight ratio===
{{Main|thrust-to-weight ratio}}
From Newton's second law, the acceleration, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, of a vehicle is simply:

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac {F_n} {m}&lt;/math&gt;
Where m is the instantaneous mass of the vehicle and &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; is the net force acting on the rocket (mostly thrust but air drag and other forces can play a part.)

As the remaining propellant decreases, rocket vehicles become lighter and their acceleration tends to increase until the propellant is exhausted. This means that much of the speed change occurs towards the end of the burn when the vehicle is much lighter.&lt;ref name="RPE7"/&gt; However, the thrust can be throttled to offset or vary this if needed. Discontinuities in acceleration also occur when stages burn out, often starting at a lower acceleration with each new stage firing.

Peak accelerations can be increased by designing the vehicle with a reduced mass, usually achieved by a reduction in the fuel load and tankage and associated structures, but obviously this reduces range, delta-v and burn time. Still, for some applications that rockets are used for, a high peak acceleration applied for just a short time is highly desirable.

The minimal mass of vehicle consists of a rocket engine with minimal fuel and structure to carry it. In that case the [[thrust-to-weight ratio]]{{#tag:ref|“thrust-to-weight ratio F/W&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is a dimensionless parameter that is identical to the acceleration of the rocket propulsion system (expressed in multiples of g&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) ... in a gravity-free vacuum”&lt;ref name="RPE7"/&gt;{{rp|442}}|group=nb}} of the rocket engine limits the maximum acceleration that can be designed. It turns out that rocket engines generally have truly excellent thrust to weight ratios (137 for the [[NK-33]] engine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/engines/nk33.htm |title=Astronautix NK-33 entry |publisher=Astronautix.com |date=2006-11-08 |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020625124013/http://www.astronautix.com/engines/nk33.htm |archivedate=2002-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; some solid rockets are over 1000&lt;ref name="RPE7"/&gt;{{rp|442}}), and nearly all really [[g-force|high-g]] vehicles employ or have employed rockets.

The high accelerations that rockets naturally possess means that rocket vehicles are often capable of [[vertical takeoff]], and in some cases, with suitable guidance and control of the engines, also [[VTVL|vertical landing]]. For these operations to be done it is necessary for a vehicle's engines to provide more than the local [[gravitational acceleration]].

===Energy===

====Energy efficiency====
[[File:Atlantis taking off on STS-27.jpg|thumb|{{OV|104}} during launch phase]]
{{Main|propulsive efficiency}}
Rocket launch vehicles take-off with a great deal of flames, noise and drama, and it might seem obvious that they are grievously inefficient. However, while they are far from perfect, their energy efficiency is not as bad as might be supposed.

The energy density of a typical rocket propellant is often around one-third that of conventional hydrocarbon fuels; the bulk of the mass is (often relatively inexpensive) oxidizer. Nevertheless, at take-off the rocket has a great deal of energy in the fuel and oxidizer stored within the vehicle. It is of course desirable that as much of the energy of the propellant end up as [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] or [[potential energy]] of the body of the rocket as possible.

Energy from the fuel is lost in air drag and [[gravity drag]] and is used for the rocket to gain altitude and speed. However, much of the lost energy ends up in the exhaust.&lt;ref name="RPE7"/&gt;{{rp|37–38}}

In a chemical propulsion device, the engine efficiency is simply the ratio of the kinetic power of the exhaust gases and the power available from the chemical reaction:&lt;ref name="RPE7"/&gt;{{rp|37–38}}

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_c= \frac {\frac {1} {2}\dot{m}v_e^2} {\eta_{combustion} P_{chem} }&lt;/math&gt;

100% efficiency within the engine (engine efficiency &lt;math&gt;\eta_c = 100\%&lt;/math&gt;) would mean that all the heat energy of the combustion products is converted into kinetic energy of the jet. [[Heat Engine#Efficiency|This is not possible]], but the near-adiabatic [[rocket engine nozzle|high expansion ratio nozzles]] that can be used with rockets come surprisingly close: when the nozzle expands the gas, the gas is cooled and accelerated, and an energy efficiency of up to 70% can be achieved. Most of the rest is heat energy in the exhaust that is not recovered.&lt;ref name="RPE7"/&gt;{{rp|37–38}} The high efficiency is a consequence of the fact that rocket combustion can be performed at very high temperatures and the gas is finally released at much lower temperatures, and so giving good [[Carnot efficiency]].

However, engine efficiency is not the whole story. In common with the other [[jet engine|jet-based engines]], but particularly in rockets due to their high and typically fixed exhaust speeds, rocket vehicles are extremely inefficient at low speeds irrespective of the engine efficiency. The problem is that at low speeds, the exhaust carries away a huge amount of [[kinetic energy]] rearward. This phenomenon is termed [[propulsive efficiency]] (&lt;math&gt;\eta_p&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name="RPE7"/&gt;{{rp|37–38}}

However, as speeds rise, the resultant exhaust speed goes down, and the overall vehicle energetic efficiency rises, reaching a peak of around 100% of the engine efficiency when the vehicle is travelling exactly at the same speed that the exhaust is emitted. In this case the exhaust would ideally stop dead in space behind the moving vehicle, taking away zero energy, and from conservation of energy, all the energy would end up in the vehicle. The efficiency then drops off again at even higher speeds as the exhaust ends up traveling forwards – trailing behind the vehicle.

[[File:Average propulsive efficiency of rockets.png|thumb|Plot of instantaneous propulsive efficiency (blue) and overall efficiency for a rocket accelerating from rest (red) as percentages of the engine efficiency]]From these principles it can be shown that the propulsive efficiency &lt;math&gt;\eta_p&lt;/math&gt; for a rocket moving at speed &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; with an exhaust velocity &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_p= \frac {2 \frac {u} {c}} {1 + ( \frac {u} {c} )^2 }&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="RPE7"/&gt;{{rp|37–38}}

And the overall (instantaneous) energy efficiency &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta= \eta_p \eta_c&lt;/math&gt;

For example, from the equation, with an &lt;math&gt;\eta_c&lt;/math&gt; of 0.7, a rocket flying at Mach 0.85 (which most aircraft cruise at) with an exhaust velocity of Mach 10, would have a predicted overall energy efficiency of 5.9%, whereas a conventional, modern, air-breathing jet engine achieves closer to 35% efficiency. Thus a rocket would need about 6x more energy; and allowing for the specific energy of rocket propellant being around one third that of conventional air fuel, roughly 18x more mass of propellant would need to be carried for the same journey. This is why rockets are rarely if ever used for general aviation.

Since the energy ultimately comes from fuel, these considerations mean that rockets are mainly useful when a very high speed is required, such as [[ICBM]]s or [[orbital spaceflight|orbital launch]]. For example, [[NASA]]'s [[space shuttle]] fires its engines for around 8.5 minutes, consuming 1,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes of solid propellant (containing 16% aluminium) and an additional 2,000,000&amp;nbsp;litres of liquid propellant (106,261&amp;nbsp;kg of [[liquid hydrogen]] fuel) to lift the 100,000&amp;nbsp;kg vehicle (including the 25,000&amp;nbsp;kg payload) to an altitude of 111&amp;nbsp;km and an orbital [[velocity]] of 30,000&amp;nbsp;km/h. At this altitude and velocity, the vehicle has a kinetic energy of about 3&amp;nbsp;TJ and a potential energy of roughly 200&amp;nbsp;GJ. Given the initial energy of 20&amp;nbsp;TJ,{{#tag:ref|The energy density is 31MJ per kg for aluminum and 143&amp;nbsp;MJ/kg for liquid hydrogen, this means that the vehicle consumes around 5&amp;nbsp;TJ of solid propellant and 15&amp;nbsp;TJ of hydrogen fuel.|group=nb}} the Space Shuttle is about 16% energy efficient at launching the orbiter.

Thus jet engines, with a better match between speed and jet exhaust speed (such as [[turbofans]]—in spite of their worse &lt;math&gt;\eta_c&lt;/math&gt;)—dominate for subsonic and supersonic atmospheric use, while rockets work best at hypersonic speeds. On the other hand, rockets serve in many short-range ''relatively'' low speed military applications where their low-speed inefficiency is outweighed by their extremely high thrust and hence high accelerations.

====Oberth effect====
{{Main|Oberth effect}}
One subtle feature of rockets relates to energy. A rocket stage, while carrying a given load, is capable of giving a particular [[delta-v]]. This delta-v means that the speed increases (or decreases) by a particular amount, independent of the initial speed. However, because [[kinetic energy]] is a square law on speed, this means that the faster the rocket is travelling before the burn the more [[orbital energy]] it gains or loses.

This fact is used in interplanetary travel. It means that the amount of delta-v to reach other planets, over and above that to reach escape velocity can be much less if the delta-v is applied when the rocket is travelling at high speeds, close to the Earth or other planetary surface; whereas waiting until the rocket has slowed at altitude multiplies up the effort required to achieve the desired trajectory.

==Safety, reliability and accidents==

{{Expand section|date=May 2016}}
The reliability of rockets, as for all physical systems, is dependent on the quality of engineering design and construction.

Because of the enormous chemical energy in [[rocket propellant]]s (greater energy by weight than explosives, but lower than [[gasoline]]), consequences of accidents can be severe. Most space missions have some problems.&lt;ref name="Janes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/aerospace/civil/news/jsd/jsd030203_3_n.shtml|title=A brief history of space accidents|date=2003-02-03|publisher=Jane's Civil Aerospace|accessdate=2010-04-24|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030204073904/http://www.janes.com/aerospace/civil/news/jsd/jsd030203_3_n.shtml|archivedate=2003-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, following the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]], American physicist [[Richard Feynman]], having served on the [[Rogers Commission]] estimated that the chance of an unsafe condition for a launch of the Shuttle was very roughly 1%;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/51-l/docs/rogers-commission/Appendix-F.txt |title=Rogers commission Appendix F |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911052800/http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/51-l/docs/rogers-commission/Appendix-F.txt |archivedate=2012-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; more recently the historical per person-flight risk in orbital spaceflight has been calculated to be around 2%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/spacetourism_future_040930.html |title=Going Private: The Promise and Danger of Space Travel By Tariq Malik |publisher=Space.com |date=2004-09-30 |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124459/http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/spacetourism_future_040930.html |archivedate=2011-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or 4%.&lt;ref name=SpaceReview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/36/2|title=Weighing the risks of human spaceflight|publisher=[[The Space Review]]|date=21 July 2003|accessdate=1 December 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123233332/http://www.thespacereview.com/article/36/2|archivedate=23 November 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Costs and economics==
The costs of rockets can be roughly divided into propellant costs, the costs of obtaining and/or producing the 'dry mass' of the rocket, and the costs of any required support equipment and facilities.&lt;ref name=aday&gt;[http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/rocketaday.html "A Rocket a Day Keeps the High Costs Away"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103045215/http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/rocketaday.html |date=2008-11-03 }} by John Walker. September 27, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the takeoff mass of a rocket is normally propellant. However propellant is seldom more than a few times more expensive than gasoline per kilogram (as of 2009 gasoline was about {{convert|1|$/kg|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} or less), and although substantial amounts are needed, for all but the very cheapest rockets, it turns out that the propellant costs are usually comparatively small, although not completely negligible.&lt;ref name=aday/&gt; With liquid oxygen costing {{convert|0.15|$/kg}} and liquid hydrogen {{convert|2.20|$/kg|abbr=on}}, the [[Space Shuttle]] in 2009 had a liquid propellant expense of approximately $1.4 million for each launch that cost $450 million from other expenses (with 40% of the mass of propellants used by it being liquids in the [[external fuel tank]], 60% solids in the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|SRBs]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/nasafact/pdf/ssp.pdf |title=Space Shuttle Use of Propellants and Fluids |publisher=Nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017180215/http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/nasafact/pdf/SSP.pdf |archivedate=October 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/nasafact/count2.htm |title=NASA Launch Vehicles and Facilities |publisher=Nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427020520/http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/nasafact/count2.htm |archivedate=2011-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/information/shuttle_faq.html |title=NASA – Space Shuttle and International Space Station |publisher=Nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-04-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507113329/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/information/shuttle_faq.html |archivedate=2011-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though a rocket's non-propellant, dry mass is often only between 5–20% of total mass,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacetethers.com/massfraction.html |title=Mass Fraction |publisher=Andrews Space and Technology (original figure source) |date= |accessdate=2011-04-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425073303/http://www.spacetethers.com/massfraction.html |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless this cost dominates. For hardware with the performance used in orbital [[launch vehicle]]s, expenses of $2000–$10,000+ per kilogram of [[dry weight]] are common, primarily from engineering, fabrication, and testing; raw materials amount to typically around 2% of total expense.&lt;ref&gt;Regis, Ed (1990),''Great Mambo Chicken And The Transhuman Condition: Science Slightly Over The Edge'', Basic Books, {{ISBN|0201567512}}. [http://groups.google.com/group/sci.space/browse_thread/thread/dcc29174a504c200/7e68102f0a014325?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q Excerpt online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = CheapRockets&gt;[[:File:LEOonthecheap.pdf|U.S. Air Force Research Report No. AU-ARI-93-8: LEO On The Cheap]]. Retrieved April 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For most rockets except reusable ones (shuttle engines) the engines need not function more than a few minutes, which simplifies design.

Extreme performance requirements for rockets reaching orbit correlate with high cost, including intensive quality control to ensure reliability despite the limited [[safety factor]]s allowable for weight reasons.&lt;ref name=CheapRockets/&gt; Components produced in small numbers if not individually machined can prevent amortization of R&amp;D and facility costs over mass production to the degree seen in more pedestrian manufacturing.&lt;ref name=CheapRockets/&gt; Amongst liquid-fueled rockets, complexity can be influenced by how much hardware must be lightweight, like pressure-fed engines can have two orders of magnitude lesser part count than pump-fed engines but lead to more weight by needing greater tank pressure, most often used in just small maneuvering thrusters as a consequence.&lt;ref name=CheapRockets/&gt;

To change the preceding factors for orbital launch vehicles, proposed methods have included mass-producing simple rockets in large quantities or on large scale,&lt;ref name=aday/&gt; or developing [[reusable launch system|reusable rockets]] meant to fly very frequently to amortize their up-front expense over many payloads, or reducing rocket performance requirements by constructing a [[non-rocket spacelaunch]] system for part of the velocity to orbit (or all of it but with most methods involving some rocket use).

The costs of support equipment, range costs and launch pads generally scale up with the size of the rocket, but vary less with launch rate, and so may be considered to be approximately a fixed cost.&lt;ref name=aday/&gt;

Rockets in applications other than launch to orbit (such as military rockets and [[JATO|rocket-assisted take off]]), commonly not needing comparable performance and sometimes mass-produced, are often relatively inexpensive.

Since about 2010 there has been more competition in the [[Space launch market competition|commercial space launch market]].

{{About|mobile telephone messaging|the early computer programming language|Short Code (computer language)}}

'''Short codes''', or '''short numbers''', are short digit sequences, significantly shorter than [[telephone number]]s, that are used to address messages in the [[Multimedia Messaging System]] (MMS) and [[short message service]] (SMS) systems of [[mobile network operator]]s. In addition to messaging, they may be used in [[abbreviated dialing]].

Short codes are designed to be easier to read and remember than telephone numbers. Short codes are unique to each operator at the technological level. Even so, providers generally have agreements to avoid overlaps. In some countries, such as the United States, some classes of numbers are inter-operator (U.S. inter-operator numbers are called '''common short codes''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.youra.com/stats/mobileuse.pdf | title=Common Short Codes: Cracking The Mobile Marketing Code | accessdate=2014-01-08 | author=Neufeld, Evan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short codes are widely used for value-added services such as [[Mobile donating|charity donations]], mobile services, ordering [[ringtones]], and television program voting. Messages sent to a short code can be billed at a higher rate than a standard SMS and may even subscribe a customer to a recurring monthly service that will be added to the customer's mobile phone bill until the user texts, for example, the word "STOP" to terminate the service.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

== Short codes and service identifiers (prefix) ==
Short codes are often associated with automated services. An automated program can handle the response and typically requires the sender to start the message with a command word or prefix. The service then responds to the command appropriately.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In ads or in other printed material where a provider has to provide both a prefix and the short code number, the advertisement will typically follow this format:{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
*Example 1 - Long version:  Text Football to 72404 for latest football news.
*Example 2 - Short version: football@72404

== Regional differences ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}

; Albania: Short Codes are five digits in length and start with 5, also are known as short codes for value added service.

; Australia: Short codes are six or eight digits in length, starting with the prefix "19" followed by an additional four or six digits and two. Communications Alliance Ltd and WMC Global are responsible for governing premium and standard rate short codes in Australia. Transactional and Subscription services require a double sms MO opt-in or Web based opt-in with an MO reply.

; Belgium: Codes are four digits in length.

; Brazil: Codes are five digits in length.

; Cambodia: Short Codes are four digits in length and start with 1.

; Canada: Canadian Common Short Codes can be five or six digits long. Common Short Codes beginning with a leading '4' are reserved for private use by wireless network operators. Four-digit Common Short Codes are not permitted due to handset incompatibilities. Short code-based messages vary between ''zero-rated'' (paid for by campaign), ''standard rate'' (user is responsible for standard carrier charges), and ''premium rate'' (varies, [[Canadian dollar|C$]]1-10). Canadian Short codes are governed by the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.txt.ca/ |title=TXT Splash |publisher=Txt.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Chile: Codes are three and four digits in length.

; Czech Republic: Messages sent to/from these short codes are known as Premium Rate SMS. Codes are seven digits in length for MO and five (not billed) or eight (billed) for MT direction, starting with nine, while two or three (depending on billing type=MO/MT) trailing digits express the price, e.g. SMS sent to 9090930 is billed for [[Czech koruna|Kč]]30. Leading three digits are purpose type prefixes (908 for micropayments, 909 for adult content and 900 for everything else), digits at position four and five determines the service provider registered by a network operator. There are also other four digit shortcodes, used by a network operators for service only purposes (operator dependent)

; Denmark: Codes are four digits in length.

; Dominican Republic: Codes are four or five digits in length.

; European Union: Common EU-wide codes start with 11. Examples include: 118xxx - directory services, 116xxx - emergency helplines. This is in addition to the EU-wide emergency number 112.
'''Ethiopia'''

Codes are four digits in length and start with 8, like 8xxx. Although the telecom sector in Ethiopia is controlled by the government, short code services are outsourced to the private sector. The short codes are used mostly for fundraising, lottery and polling.

; Finland: Codes are five or more digits in length, usually five or six.

; France: Codes are five digits in length. Starting digits define the cost of the service.

; Germany: Codes are four or five digits in length.

; Greece: Codes are five digits in length.

; Hungary: Codes are four or five digits in length.

; India: There are many companies in the Indian market who rent keywords, on a monthly basis, whose characters, on a typical [[telephone keypad]], represent short codes.  Short codes are five digits in length and have to start with the digit  '5'. The five digits can be extended by three digits further representing three additional characters. Texts sent to these Short Codes are commonly referred to as Premium Rate SMS Messages and cost around [[Indian rupee|Rs]] 1 to Rs 3 per text depending on the operator as well as the service. Any length of full message can be sent, ranging from 100&amp;ndash;500 (some providers only support).

; Indonesia: Codes are four digits in length with [[Indonesian rupiah|Rp]]2000 premium price.

; Republic of Ireland: Short codes are five digits in length, and start with 5. The second digit generally indicates the maximum price, with 0 = completely free, 1 = standard text rate only, 3 = [[Euro|€]]0.60, and 7 having no maximum. Codes beginning 59 are ostensibly intended for adult services, but few if any of these codes are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regtel.ie |title=Commission for Communications Regulation - RegTel Information |publisher=Regtel.ie |date=2010-07-12 |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Italy: In Italy short codes have no fixed length, starting from three digits up to five. All short codes that start with the digit "4", are designated by a local telecommunications law for "network services". Widely known short codes are in the 48xxx range, commercial ringtones and mobile stuff download.

; Korea, South: Codes are generally four to six digits in length, however short codes have no fixed length.

; Latvia: In Latvia short codes also have no fixed length, starting from three digits up to five. All 4 digit short codes that start with "118" or 5 digit short codes that start with "1184" are designated to information service providers.

; Lithuania: In Lithuania short codes also have no fixed length, starting from three digits up to five. All short codes that start with the digit "1", are designated by a local telecommunications law for "network services".

; Malaysia: Codes are five digits in length, start with "2" or "3", premium pricing from [[Malaysian ringgit|RM]]0.30 up to 10.00. Codes are MT billed so subscription services are allowed. Upon service description approval by mobile operators, dedicated codes are generally live in 4 weeks, and shared codes after 1 week.

; Morocco: Code are four keys digits in length.

; Nepal: Codes are three to four digits in length. Dialing shortcodes are generally 3 digits, and reserved for public services. SMS shortcodes are used for a range of purposes, and are four digits.

; The Netherlands: Codes are four digits in length.

; Nigeria: Codes are four to five digits in length.

; Norway: Codes are four and five digits in length.

; New Zealand: Codes are three and four digits in length.

; Pakistan: Codes are three and four digits in length. Users are charged PKR 5 - PKR 25 per SMS sent on short codes. Mobile operators charge a setup fee, monthly fee and fee per keyword for short codes. Short codes usage must abide by the rules set by PTA (Pakistan Telecom Authority).

; Panama: Codes are four digits in length.

; Poland: Commercial codes are five digit long (1xxxx) and are reachable from both mobile and fixed networks. Calls to short codes - from any type of network - are routed based on the location of the number originating the call; hence, if wishing to reach a particular geographical area, the subscriber might need to prefix the short code with an appropriate area code.

; Philippines: Codes are four digits in length. The National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) is a regulatory agency providing an environment that ensures reliable, affordable and viable infrastructure and services in information and communications technology (ICT) accessible to all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.ntc.gov.ph/wps/portal |title=The National Telecommunications Commission Web Portal |publisher=Portal.ntc.gov.ph |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930121357/http://portal.ntc.gov.ph/wps/portal |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the NTC is ultimately responsible for the governance of premium and non-premium shortcodes in the Philippines, the NTC's regulatory guidelines are not comprehensive when applied to shortcodes. Instead NTC's guidelines focus more on the carriers and the carrier's technical infrastructure. NTC's website does not contain any specific information with regard to premium SMS or standard rate SMS. There is relevant documentation for Bulk SMS and SPAM control via NTC's "AMENDMENT TO THE RULES AND REGULATIONS ON BROADCAST MESSAGING SERVICES", however again is not directly related to premium SMS.

; Russia: Codes are four digits in length. The cost of the call or SMS to the short number varies from 1.2 to 300 [[Russian ruble|rubles]], depending on the number and the carrier.

; Serbia: Codes are four digits in length.

; Singapore: Codes are five digits in length.

; South Africa: Codes are five digits in length. Short codes will start with either a "3" or "4". For example, 34001 or 42001. Each short code or short code range (a range will generally be 34000 to 34009) are assigned specific tariffs or end user prices (EUP). The tariff charges can range from [[South African rand|R]]0.50 to R30.00 on mobile originated billing and from R0.50 to R50.00 using mobile terminated billing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waspa.org.za |title=WASPA Website |publisher=Waspa.org.za |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smscode.co.za |title=sms c.o.d.e.s |publisher=Smscode.co.za |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to high costs associated with short code rental many providers offer shared shortcodes, which greatly reduces costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicsms.co.za/PremiumSMS/Default.html |title=Shared Shortcodes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Spain: Codes are four digits in length.

; Sweden: Codes are five digits in length.

; Switzerland: Codes are three to five digits in length (most popular codes are three digits long); codes starting with "6" are reserved for adult services.

; Taiwan: Codes are usually four digits in length, starting with digits "19".

; Turkey: Codes are four digits in length.

; United Kingdom: Codes are five digits in length, mostly starting with 6 or 8. Codes starting 70 are used by charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.short-codes.com/ |title=Short-Codes.com |publisher=Short-Codes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of codes may be expanded in time to use other leading digits such as 4. Adult related mobile services must use codes starting with 69 or 89. Mobile operators sometimes use proprietary codes (either with a different leading digit or shorter in length for their own use). SMS short codes are often owned by holding companies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smsshortcodes.co.uk/shared-and-dedicated-shortcodes.htm | title=A Short Guide to a (UK) Short Code | work=SMSshortcodes.co.uk | date=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; who then lease them out to service providers and advertisers to promote SMS services, charitable fundraising and marketing promotions such as news alerts, voting and quizzes. Shortcodes can also be used to deliver additional content or a mobile URL link that when prompted opens the mobile web browser linking the user to a mobile web page. Premium SMS services use codes that can be set to deliver a charge to a participant’s mobile phone (in accordance with the service provider’s terms of service). Other codes (typically used by advertisers) can be free to receive “your standard rate applies” or free to send and receive. UK Premium rated SMS services are regulated by [[PhonepayPlus]]. All charges and associated terms linked to a premium code should be transparent to the consumer. To stop a subscription based shortcode service text the word 'STOP' to the shortcode number.

; United States: As of May 31, 2006, the standard lengths for interoperable short codes are five and six digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usshortcodes.com/csc_press053106.html | title=Common Short Code Administration Announces Open Registration of 6-Digit Codes | publisher=CTIA | work=Press Release | date=2006-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carriers use short codes with fewer digits for carrier-specific programs - e.g., "Text [[6-1-1|611]] to see how many minutes you have remaining on your plan." Codes starting with 1 are not permitted. Common short codes in the U.S. are leased by the program's registry service provider [[iconectiv]], under a deal with the [[Common Short Code Administration]] and [[Cellular Telecommunications &amp; Internet Association|CTIA]].&lt;ref name="wirelessweek"/&gt; Short codes are leased at a price, with a selected code costing twice that of a random code.&lt;ref name="wirelessweek"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wirelessweek.com/news/2007/04/decoding-short-codes | title=Decoding Short Codes | work=WirelessWeek | date=2007-04-15 | author=Alleven, Monica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some carriers assign a subset of their carrier-specific codes to third parties.&lt;ref name="Short1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctia.org/resource-library/press-releases/archive/ctia-announced-new-strategic-partner-iconectiv-for-common-short-code-registry-services |title=CTIA Announced New Strategic Partner iconectiv for Common Short Code Registry Services |publisher=[[CTIA – The Wireless Association]] |date=2015-07-30 |accessdate=2016-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5090">A '''solar-powered desalination unit'''  produces [[potable water]] from [[saline water]] through direct or indirect methods of [[desalination]] powered by sunlight. Countries such as Australia, Italy and Egypt have adopted this system as an alternative source of water for the population.&lt;ref name="STDT"&gt;[http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0011916407006650/1-s2.0-S0011916407006650-main.pdf?_tid=b3eac35e1a44bcdf2ba93d8dc463c341&amp;acdnat=1335417130_9eea306175f5911f084d2171d4f4a660 Solar thermal desalination technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct solar desalination produces distillate directly in the solar collector. An example would be a [[solar still]] which traps the Sun's energy to obtain freshwater through the process of [[evaporation]] and [[condensation]]. Indirect solar desalination incorporates solar energy collection systems with conventional desalination systems such as [[multi-stage flash distillation]], [[multiple effect evaporation]], freeze separation or [[reverse osmosis]] to produce [[freshwater]].&lt;ref name="STDT" /&gt;

The intermittent nature of sunlight and its variable intensity throughout the day makes predicting its efficiency difficult. However, incorporating a [[thermal energy storage]] system solves this problem and ensures constant performance even during non-sunlight hours and cloudy days, improving overall efficiency.&lt;ref name="TES"&gt;[http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0306261911006696/1-s2.0-S0306261911006696-main.pdf?_tid=1afa88d0641c9bdee6495e5eec5cbc9c&amp;acdnat=1335424299_1b6be246f1cf3e2adbbc38a26e965813 Low temperature desalination using solar collectors augmented by thermal energy storage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solar stills==
One type of solar desalination unit is a [[solar still]], it is also similar to a condensation trap. A solar still is a simple way of distilling water, using the heat of the Sun to drive evaporation from humid soil, and ambient air to cool a condenser film. Two basic types of solar stills are box and pit stills. In a solar still, impure water is contained outside the collector, where it is evaporated by sunlight shining through clear plastic. The pure water vapor condenses on the cool inside plastic surface and drips down from the weighted low point, where it is collected and removed. The box type is more sophisticated. The basic principles of solar water distillation are simple, yet effective, as distillation replicates the way nature makes rain. The sun's energy heats water to the point of evaporation. As the water evaporates, water vapor rises, condensing on the glass surface for collection. This process removes impurities, such as salts and heavy metals, and eliminates microbiological organisms. The end result is water cleaner than the purest rainwater.

==ROSI==
A solar powered desalination unit designed for remote communities has been tested in the [[Northern Territory]] of [[Australia]]. The "reverse-osmosis solar installation" (ROSI) uses [[membrane technology|membrane filtration]] to provide a reliable and clean drinking water stream from sources such as [[brackish water|brackish]] [[groundwater]]. [[Solar energy]] overcomes the usually high-energy operating costs as well as [[greenhouse emissions]] of conventional reverse osmosis systems.

Project leader Dr Andrea Schaefer from the [[University of Wollongong]]'s Faculty of Engineering said ROSI has the potential to bring clean water to remote communities throughout Australia that do not have access to a town water supply and/or the electricity grid.&lt;ref name=uow/&gt;

Groundwater (which may contain dissolved salts or other contaminants) or surface water (which may have high [[turbidity]] or contain [[microorganism]]s) is pumped into a tank with an [[ultrafiltration]] membrane, which removes viruses and bacteria.  This water is fit for cleaning and bathing.  Ten percent of that water undergoes [[nanofiltration]] and [[reverse osmosis]] in the second stage of purification, which removes salts and trace contaminants, producing drinking water.  A [[photovoltaic]] solar array tracks the Sun and powers the pumps needed to process the water, using the plentiful sunlight available in remote regions of Australia not served by the power grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adu-res.org/pdf/University_of_Wollongong.pdf PV-Powered Desalination in Australia: Technology Development and Applications]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TNT equivalent''' is a convention for expressing energy, typically used to describe the energy released in an explosion. The "ton of TNT" is a [[unit of energy]] defined by that convention to be 4.184 [[gigajoule]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitconversion.org/energy/tons-explosives-to-gigajoules-conversion.html |title=Tons (Explosives) to Gigajoules Conversion Calculator |work=unitconversion.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the approximate energy released in the [[detonation]] of a [[tonne|metric ton]] (1,000 kilograms or one megagram) of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]]. In other words, for each gram of TNT exploded, 4,184 joules of energy are released. 

This convention intends to compare the destructiveness of an event with that of traditional [[explosive material]]s, of which TNT is a typical example, although other conventional explosives such as [[dynamite]] contain more energy.

== Kiloton and megaton ==
The "'''kiloton''' (of [[TNT]])" is a unit of energy equal to 4.184 [[tera-|tera]][[joule]]s.

The "'''megaton''' (of TNT)" is a unit of energy equal to 4.184 [[peta-|peta]][[joule]]s.

The kiloton and megaton of TNT have traditionally been used to describe the energy output, and hence the destructive power, of a [[nuclear weapon]]. The TNT equivalent appears in various [[CTBT|nuclear weapon control treaties]], and has been used to characterize the energy released in such other highly destructive events as an [[Impact event|asteroid impact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitconversion.org/energy/joules-to-megatons-conversion.html|title=Joules to Megatons Conversion Calculator|work=unitconversion.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical derivation of the value ==
A gram of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] releases 2673–6702&amp;nbsp;J ([[joule]]s) upon explosion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00629253/document Blast effects of external explosions (Section 4.8. Limitations of the TNT equivalent method)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810225249/http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00629253/document |date=August 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy liberated by one gram of TNT was arbitrarily defined as a matter of convention to be 4184&amp;nbsp;J,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Appendix B8 – Factors for Units Listed Alphabetically |url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB8.html}} In {{harvnb|NIST SI Guide|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is exactly one [[Calorie|kilocalorie]].

An explosive's energy is normally expressed as the [[thermodynamic work]] produced by its detonation, which for TNT has been accurately measured as 4686&amp;nbsp;J/g from a large sample of air blast experiments, and theoretically calculated to be 4853&amp;nbsp;J/g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first= Paul W. |title=Explosives Engineering|location= New York|publisher= Wiley-VCH|year= 1996|page= 406 |isbn=0-471-18636-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measured, pure [[heat]] output of a gram of TNT is only 2724&amp;nbsp;J,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-1-4266-2459-9 |url=http://muller.lbl.gov/teaching/Physics10/old%20physics%2010/chapters%20(old)/1-Explosions.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528072252/http://muller.lbl.gov/teaching/Physics10/old%20physics%2010/chapters%20%28old%29/1-Explosions.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-05-28 |title=Physics for Future Presidents, a textbook |year=2001–2002 |first=Richard A. |last=Muller |chapter=Chapter 1.

Alternative TNT equivalency can be calculated as a function of when in the detonation the value is measured and which property is being compared.&lt;ref&gt;Sorin Bastea, Laurence E. Fried, Kurt R.

== {{Visible anchor|Relative effectiveness factor}} ==&lt;!-- Other alrticles link here. --&gt;
The relative effectiveness factor (RE factor) relates an explosive's demolition power to that of TNT, in units of the TNT equivalent/kg (TNTe/kg). The RE factor is the relative mass of TNT to which an explosive is equivalent: The greater the RE, the more powerful the explosive.

This enables engineers to determine the proper masses of different explosives when applying blasting formulas developed specifically for TNT. For example, if a timber-cutting formula calls for a charge of 1&amp;nbsp;kg of TNT, then based on [[octanitrocubane]]'s RE factor of 2.38, it would take only 1.0/2.38 (or 0.42) kg of it to do the same job. Using [[PETN]], engineers would need 1.0/1.66 (or 0.60) kg to obtain the same effects as 1&amp;nbsp;kg of TNT. With [[ANFO]] or [[ammonium nitrate]], they would require 1.0/0.74 (or 1.35) kg or 1.0/0.42 (or 2.38) kg, respectively.

{{TopicTOC-World War II}}

Technology played a significant role in [[World War II]]. Some of the technologies used during the war were developed during the interwar years of the 1920s and 1930s, much was developed in response to needs and lessons learned during the war, while others were beginning to be developed as the war ended. Many wars had major effects on the technologies that we use in our daily lives. However, compared to previous wars, World War II had the greatest effect on the technology and devices that are used today. Technology also played a greater role in the conduct of World War II than in any other war in history, and had a critical role in its final outcome.

Many types of technology were customized for military use, and major developments occurred across several fields including:
* Weaponry: ships, vehicles, submarines, aircraft, tanks, artillery, small arms; and biological, chemical, and atomic weapons
* Logistical support: vehicles necessary for transporting soldiers and supplies, such as trains, trucks, tanks, ships, and aircraft
* Communications and intelligence: devices used for navigation, communication, remote sensing, and espionage
* Medicine: surgical innovations, chemical medicines, and techniques
* Rocketry: atomic bombs and automatic aircraft

World War II was the first war where military operations widely targeted the research efforts of the enemy. This included the exfiltration of [[Niels Bohr]] from German-occupied Denmark to Britain in 1943; the sabotage of [[Norwegian heavy water sabotage|Norwegian heavy water production]]; and the bombing of [[Bombing of Peenemunde in World War II|Peenemunde]].

Military operations were also conducted to obtain intelligence on the enemy's technology; for example, the [[Bruneval Raid]] for German radar and [[Operation Most III]] for the German V-2.

== Between the wars ==        
In August, 1919 the British [[Ten Year Rule]] declared the government should not expect another war within ten years. Consequently, they conducted very little military R &amp; D. In contrast, Germany and the Soviet Union were dissatisfied powers who, for different reasons, cooperated with each other on military R &amp; D. [[Soviet-German relations before 1941|The Soviets offered Weimar Germany facilities]] deep inside the USSR for building and testing arms and for military training, well away from Treaty inspectors' eyes. In return, they asked for access to German technical developments, and for assistance in creating a Red Army General Staff.

The great artillery manufacturer [[Krupp]] was soon active in the south of the USSR, near [[Rostov-on-Don]]. In 1925, a flying school was established at Vivupal, near Lipetsk, to train the first pilots for the future Luftwaffe. Since 1926, the Reichswehr had been able to use a tank school at Kazan (codenamed Kama) and a chemical weapons facility in Samara Oblast (codenamed Tomka). In turn, the Red Army gained access to these training facilities, as well as military technology and theory from Weimar Germany.

In the late 1920s, Germany helped Soviet industry begin to modernize, and to assist in the establishment of tank production facilities at the Leningrad Bolshevik Factory and the Kharkov Locomotive Factory. This cooperation would break down when Hitler rose to power in 1933. The failure of the [[World Disarmament Conference]] marked the beginnings of the arms race leading to war.

In [[France]] the lesson of World War I was translated into the [[Maginot Line]] which was supposed to hold a line at the border with [[Germany]]. The Maginot Line did achieve its political objective of ensuring that any German invasion had to go through Belgium ensuring that France would have Britain as a military ally. France and Russia had more, and much better, [[tank]]s than Germany as of the outbreak of their hostilities in 1940. As in World War I, the French generals expected that armour would mostly serve to help [[infantry]] break the static trench lines and storm [[machine gun]] nests. They thus spread the armour among their infantry divisions, ignoring the new German doctrine of [[blitzkrieg]] based on the fast movement using concentrated armour attacks, against which there was no effective defense but mobile [[anti-tank gun]]s - infantry [[Antitank rifle]]s not being effective against medium and heavy tanks.

[[Air power]] was a major concern of Germany and Britain between the wars. Trade in aircraft engines continued, with Britain selling hundreds of its best to German firms - which used them in a first generation of aircraft, and then improved on them much for use in German aircraft. These new inventions lead the way to major success for the Germans in World War II.
Germany had always been and has continued to be in the forefront of internal combustion engine development.  Göttingen was the world center of aerodynamics and fluid dynamics in general, at least up to the time when the highly dogmatic Nazi party came to power.  This contributed to the German development of jet aircraft and of submarines with improved under-water performance.

Induced nuclear fission was discovered in Germany in 1939 by Otto Hahn (and expatriate Jews in Sweden), but many of the scientists needed to develop nuclear power had already been lost, due to anti-Jewish and anti-intellectual policies.

Scientists have been at the heart of warfare and their contributions have often been decisive. As [[Ian Jacob]], the wartime military secretary of [[Winston Churchill]], famously remarked on the influx of refugee scientists (including 19 [[Nobel laureates]]), "the Allies won the [Second World] War because our German scientists were better than their German scientists”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/dominicselwood/100256587/the-man-who-invented-poison-gas-a-horror-story/ | title=The man who invented poison gas | publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date=29 January 2014 | accessdate=29 January 2014 | author=[[Dominic Selwood]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allied cooperation==
{{main|Allied technological cooperation during World War II}}
The [[Allies of World War II]] cooperated extensively in the development and manufacture of new and existing technologies to support military operations and intelligence gathering during the Second World War. There are various ways in which the allies cooperated, including the American [[Lend-Lease]] scheme and hybrid weapons such as the [[Sherman Firefly]] as well as the British [[Tube Alloys]] nuclear weapons research project which was absorbed into the American-led [[Manhattan Project]]. Several technologies invented in Britain proved critical to the military and were widely manufactured by the Allies during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Technology and the Second World War|url=http://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/ww2/|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=26 April 2015|date=16 March 2004|last=Roberts|first=Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''Engineers of Victory: The Problem Solvers Who Turned The Tide in the Second World War'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James W. Brennan, "The Proximity Fuze: Whose Brainchild?," ''U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings'' (1968) 94#9 pp 72–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Septimus H. Paul|title=Nuclear Rivals: Anglo-American Atomic Relations, 1941–1952|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fSZpgW-N628C&amp;pg=PA1|year=2000|publisher=Ohio State U.P.|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the cooperation stemmed from a 1940 visit by the [[Aeronautical Research Committee]] chairman [[Henry Tizard]] that arranged to transfer U.K. military technology to the U.S. in case of the successful invasion of the U.K. that Hitler was planning as [[Operation Sea Lion]]. Tizard led a British technical mission, known as the [[Tizard Mission]], containing details and examples of British technological developments in fields such as [[radar]], [[jet engine|jet propulsion]] and also the [[Tube Alloys|early British research]] into the [[atomic bomb]]. One of the devices brought to the U.S. by the Mission, the [[Cavity Magnetron|resonant cavity magnetron]], was later described as "the most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores".&lt;ref&gt;James Phinney Baxter III (Official Historian of the Office of Scientific Research and Development), ''Scientists Against Time'' (Boston: Little, Brown, and Co., 1946), page 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weaponry==
{{main|List of World War II weapons}}
Military weapons technology experienced rapid advances during World War II, and over six years there was a disorientating rate of change in combat in everything from aircraft to [[small arms]]. Indeed, the war began with most armies utilizing technology that had changed little from World War I, and in some cases, had remained unchanged since the 19th century. For instance [[cavalry]], [[Trench warfare|trenches]], and World War I-era [[battleship]]s were normal in 1940, however within only six years, armies around the world had developed [[jet aircraft]], [[ballistic missile]]s, and even [[atomic weapons]] in the case of the United States.

The best [[List of jet aircraft of World War II|jet fighters]] at the end of the war easily outflew any of the leading aircraft of 1939, such as the [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire Mark I]]. The early war bombers that caused such carnage would almost all have been shot down in 1945, many by radar-aimed, [[proximity fuse]]-detonated [[anti-aircraft]] fire, just as the 1941 "invincible fighter", the [[Mitsubishi Zero|Zero]], had by 1944 become the "turkey" of the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea|"Marianas Turkey Shoot"]]. The best late-war tanks, such as the Soviet [[Iosif Stalin tank|JS-3]] [[heavy tank]] or the German [[Panther tank|Panther]] [[medium tank]], handily outclassed the best tanks of 1939 such as [[Panzer III]]s. In the navy the battleship, long seen as the dominant element of sea power, was displaced by the greater range and striking power of the [[aircraft carrier]]. The chaotic importance of amphibious landings stimulated the Western Allies to develop the [[Higgins boat]], a primary troop landing craft; the [[DUKW]], a six-wheel-drive amphibious truck, amphibious tanks to enable beach landing attacks and [[Landing Ship, Tank]]s to land tanks on beaches. Increased organization and coordination of amphibious assaults coupled with the resources necessary to sustain them caused the complexity of planning to increase by orders of magnitude, thus requiring formal systematization giving rise to what has become the modern management [[methodology]] of [[project management]] by which almost all modern [[engineering]], [[construction]] and [[Software engineering|software developments]] are organized.

===Aircraft===
In the [[Western Europe|Western]] [[European Theatre of World War II]], air power became crucial throughout the war, both in tactical and strategic operations (respectively, battlefield and long-range). Superior German aircraft, aided by ongoing introduction of design and technology innovations, allowed the German armies to overrun Western Europe with great speed in 1940, largely assisted by lack of Allied aircraft, which in any case lagged in design and technical development during the slump in research investment after the [[Great Depression]].
Since the end of World War I, the [[French Air Force]] had been badly neglected, as military leaders preferred to spend money on ground armies and static [[fortifications]] to fight another World War I-style war. As a result, by 1940, the French Air Force had only 1562 planes and was together with 1070 RAF planes facing 5,638 [[Luftwaffe]] fighters and [[fighter-bomber]]s. Most French airfields were located in north-east [[French Third Republic|France]], and were quickly overrun in the early stages of the campaign. The [[Royal Air Force]] of the [[United Kingdom]] possessed some very advanced fighter planes, such as [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]]s and [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]]s, but these were not useful for attacking ground troops on a battlefield, and the small number of planes dispatched to France with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] were destroyed fairly quickly. Subsequently, the Luftwaffe was able to achieve air superiority over France in 1940, giving the German military an immense advantage in terms of reconnaissance and intelligence.

German aircraft rapidly achieved air superiority over France in early 1940, allowing the Luftwaffe to begin a campaign of [[strategic bombing]] against British cities. Utilizing France's airfields near the [[English Channel]] the Germans were able to launch raids on [[London]] and other cities during [[the Blitz]], with varying degrees of success.

After World War I, the concept of massed aerial bombing—"[[The bomber will always get through]]"—had become very popular with politicians and military leaders seeking an alternative to the carnage of trench warfare, and as a result, the air forces of Britain, France, and Germany had developed fleets of bomber planes to enable this (France's bomber wing was severely neglected, whilst Germany's bombers were developed in secret as they were explicitly forbidden by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]).

The bombing of [[Shanghai]] by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] on January 28, 1932, and [[Battle of Shanghai|August 1937]] and the bombings during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939), had demonstrated the power of strategic bombing, and so air forces in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] came to view bomber aircraft as extremely powerful weapons which, in theory, could bomb an enemy nation into submission on their own. As a result, the fear of bombers triggered major developments in aircraft technology.

[[Nazi Germany]] had put only one large, long-range strategic bomber (the [[Heinkel He 177]] Greif, with many delays and problems) into production, while the [[America Bomber]] concept resulted only in prototypes.  The Spanish Civil War had proved that tactical dive-bombing using [[Stuka]]s was a very efficient way of destroying enemy troops concentrations, and so resources and money had been devoted to the development of smaller bomber craft. As a result, the Luftwaffe was forced to attack London in 1940 with heavily overloaded [[Heinkel]] and [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier]] medium bombers, and even with the unsuitable Junkers Ju 87. These bombers were painfully slow—Italian  engineers had been unable to develop sufficiently large [[piston]] aircraft engines (those that were produced tended to explode through extreme overheating), and so the bombers used for the [[Battle of Britain]] were woefully undersized. As German bombers had not been designed for long-range strategic missions, they lacked sufficient defenses.  The [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighter escorts [[Aircraft of the Battle of Britain#German fighter fuel capacity|had not been equipped to carry enough fuel]] to guard the bombers on both the outbound and return journeys, and the longer-range Bf 110s could be outmanoeuvred by the short-range British fighters. (A bizarre feature of the war was how long it took to conceive of the [[Drop tank]].)  The air defense was well organized and equipped with effective radar that survived the bombing.  As a result, German bombers were shot down in large numbers, and were unable to inflict enough damage on cities and military-industrial targets to force Britain out of the war in 1940 or to prepare for the planned invasion.

British long-range bomber planes such as the [[Short Stirling]] had been designed before 1939 for strategic flights and given a large armament, but their technology still suffered from numerous flaws. The smaller and shorter ranged [[Bristol Blenheim]], the RAF's most-used bomber, was defended by only one hydraulically operated machine-gun turret, and whilst this appeared sufficient, it was soon revealed that the turret was a pathetic defence against squadrons of German fighter planes. American bomber planes such as the [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] had been built before the war as the only adequate long-range bombers in the world, designed to patrol the long American coastlines. Defended by as many as six machine-gun turrets providing 360° cover, the B-17s were still vulnerable without fighter protection even when used in large formations.

Despite the abilities of Allied bombers, though, Germany was not quickly crippled by Allied air raids. At the start of the war the vast majority of bombs fell miles from their targets, as poor navigation technology ensured that Allied airmen frequently could not find their targets at night. The bombs used by the Allies were very high-tech devices, and mass production meant that the precision bombs were often made sloppily and so failed to explode. German industrial production actually rose continuously from 1940 to 1945, despite the best efforts of the Allied air forces to cripple industry.

Significantly, the bomber offensive kept the revolutionary [[German Type XXI submarine|Type XXI U-Boat]] from entering service during the war. Moreover, Allied air raids had a serious propaganda impact on the German government, all prompting Germany to begin serious development on air defence technology—in the form of fighter planes.

The practical jet aircraft age began just before the start of the war with the development of the Heinkel He 178, the first true turbojet. Late in the war the Germans brought in the first operational Jet fighter, the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]]. However, despite their seeming technological edge, German jets were often hampered by technical problems, such as short engine lives, with the Me 262 having an estimated operating life of just ten hours before failing.&lt;ref&gt;"Jet Fighters: Inside &amp; Out", Jim Winchester, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; German jets were also overwhelmed by Allied air superiority, frequently being destroyed on or near the airstrip. Other jet aircraft, such as the first and only Allied jet fighter of the war, the British [[Gloster Meteor]], saw combat against German V-1 flying bombs&lt;ref&gt;"Meteor I vs V1 Flying Bomb", Nijboer, Donald.&lt;/ref&gt; but did not significantly distinguish themselves from top-line, late-war piston-driven aircraft.

Aircraft saw rapid and broad development during the war to meet the demands of aerial combat and address lessons learned from combat experience. From the open cockpit airplane to the sleek jet fighter, many different types were employed, often designed for very specific missions.  Aircraft were used in anti-submarine warfare against German U-Boats, by the Germans to mine shipping lanes and by the Japanese against previously formidable Royal Navy battleships such as {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53}}.

During the war the Germans produced various Glide bomb weapons, which were the first smart bombs; the V-1 flying bomb, which was the first [[cruise missile]] weapon; and the V-2 rocket, the first [[ballistic missile]] weapon. The last of these was the first step into the space age as its trajectory took it through the stratosphere, higher and faster than any aircraft. This later led to the development of the [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM). [[Wernher Von Braun]] led the V-2 development team and later emigrated to the United States where he contributed to the development of the [[Saturn V]] rocket, which took men to the moon in 1969.

====Theoretical foundation====
The laboratory of [[Ludwig Prandtl]] at [[University of Göttingen]] was the main center of theoretical and mathematical aerodynamics and fluid dynamics research from soon after 1904 to the end of World War II. Prandtl coined the term [[boundary layer]] and founded modern (mathematical) [[aerodynamics]]. The laboratory lost its dominance when the researchers were dispersed after the war.

====Fuel====
The Axis countries had serious shortages of petroleum from which to make liquid fuel.  The Allies had much more petroleum production.  Germany, long before the war, developed a process to make [[Synthetic fuel#History|synthetic fuel]] from coal.  Synthesis factories were principal targets of the [[Oil Campaign of World War II]].

The USA added [[tetra ethyl lead]] to its aviation fuel, with which it supplied Britain and other Allies.  This octane enhancing additive allowed higher compression ratios, allowing higher efficiency, giving more speed and range to Allied Airplanes, and reducing the cooling load.

===Vehicles===
The Treaty of Versailles had imposed severe restrictions upon Germany constructing vehicles for military purposes, and so throughout the 1920s and 1930s, German arms manufacturers and the [[Wehrmacht]] had begun secretly developing [[tanks]]. As these vehicles were produced in secret, their technical specifications and battlefield potentials were largely unknown to the European Allies until the war actually began.

French and British Generals believed that a future war with Germany would be fought under very similar conditions as those of 1914–1918. Both invested in thickly armoured, heavily armed vehicles designed to cross shell-damaged ground and trenches under fire. At the same time the British also developed faster but lightly armoured [[Cruiser tank]]s to range behind the enemy lines.

Only a handful of French tanks had radios, and these often broke as the tank lurched over uneven ground. German tanks were, on the contrary, all equipped with radios, allowing them to communicate with one another throughout battles, whilst French tank commanders could rarely contact other vehicles.

The [[Matilda Mk I]] tanks of the [[British Army]] were also designed for [[infantry tank|infantry support]] and were protected by thick armour. This was ideal for trench warfare,{{dubious|date=February 2012}} but made the tanks painfully slow in open battles. Their light cannons{{dubious|date=February 2012}} and machine-guns were usually unable to inflict serious damage on German vehicles. The exposed caterpillar tracks were easily broken by gunfire, and the Matilda tanks had a tendency to incinerate their crews if hit,{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} as the petrol tanks were located on the top of the hull. By contrast the [[Matilda II|Infantry tank Matilda II]] fielded in lesser numbers was largely invulnerable to German gunfire and its gun was able to punch through the German tanks. However French and British tanks were at a disadvantage compared to the air supported German armoured assaults, and a lack of armoured support contributed significantly to the rapid Allied collapse in 1940.

World War II marked the first full-scale war where [[mechanized warfare|mechanization]] played a significant role. Most nations did not begin the war equipped for this. Even the vaunted [[German tanks in World War II|German Panzer]] forces relied heavily on non-motorised support and flank units in large operations. While Germany recognized and demonstrated the value of concentrated use of mechanized forces, they never had these units in enough quantity to supplant traditional units. However, the British also saw the value in mechanization. For them it was a way to enhance an otherwise limited manpower reserve. America as well sought to create a mechanized army. For the United States, it was not so much a matter of limited troops, but instead a strong industrial base that could afford such equipment on a great scale.

The most visible vehicles of the war were the [[tank]]s, forming the armored spearhead of mechanized warfare. Their impressive firepower and armor made them the premier fighting machine of ground warfare. However, the large number of trucks and lighter vehicles that kept the infantry, artillery, and others moving were massive undertakings also.

===Ships===
Naval warfare changed dramatically during World War II, with the ascent of the [[aircraft carrier]] to the premier vessel of the fleet, and the impact of increasingly capable [[submarine]]s on the course of the war. The development of new ships during the war was somewhat limited due to the protracted time period needed for production, but important developments were often retrofitted to older vessels. Advanced German submarine types came into service too late and after nearly all the experienced crews had been lost.

In addition to aircraft carriers, its assisting counterpart of [[destroyers]] were advanced as well. From the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], the [[Fubuki-class destroyer]] was introduced. The Fubuki class set a new standard not only for Japanese vessels, but for destroyers around the world. At a time when British and American destroyers had changed little from their un-turreted, single-gun mounts and light weaponry, the Japanese destroyers were bigger, more powerfully armed, and faster than any similar class of vessel in the other fleets. The Japanese destroyers of World War II are said to be the world's first modern destroyer.&lt;ref&gt;Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway''.  p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German [[U-boat]]s were used primarily for stopping/destroying the resources from the United States and [[Canada]] coming across the Atlantic. Submarines were critical in the [[Pacific Ocean]] as well as in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Advances in submarine technology included the [[Submarine snorkel|snorkel]].  Japanese defenses against Allied submarines were ineffective. Much of the merchant fleet of the [[Empire of Japan]], needed to supply its scattered forces and bring supplies such as petroleum and food back to the [[Japanese Archipelago]], was sunk. Among the warships sunk by submarines was the war's largest aircraft carrier, the [[Japanese aircraft carrier Shinano|''Shinano'']].

The Kriegsmarine introduced the [[pocket battleship]] to get around constraints imposed by the Treaty of Versailles.  Innovations included the use of diesel engines, and welded rather than riveted hulls.

The most important shipboard advances were in the field of anti-submarine warfare. Driven by the desperate necessity of keeping Britain supplied, technologies for the detection and destruction of submarines was advanced at high priority. The use of [[Sonar|ASDIC (SONAR)]] became widespread and so did the installation of shipboard and airborne radar.  The Allies [[Ultra]] code breaking allowed convoys to be steered around German U-Boat [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpacks]].

==Weapons==
The actual weapons; the guns, [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s, [[artillery]], [[bomb]]s, and other devices, were as diverse as the participants and objectives. A large array were developed during the war to meet specific needs that arose, but many traced their early development to prior to World War II.
Torpedoes began to use magnetic detonators; compass-directed, programmed and even acoustic guidance systems; and improved propulsion. [[Fire-control system]]s continued to develop for ships' guns and came into use for torpedoes and anti-aircraft fire. [[Human torpedo]]es and the [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] were also developed.

*Armour weapons: The [[Tank destroyer]], [[Hobart's Funnies|Specialist Tanks]] for [[Combat engineering]] including mine clearing [[Flail (tank)|Flail]] tanks, [[Flame tank]], and amphibious designs
*Aircraft: [[Glide bomb]]s - the first "smart bombs", such as the [[Fritz X]] anti-shipping missile, had wire or radio remote control; the world's first jet fighter ([[Messerschmitt 262]]) and jet bomber ([[Arado 234]]), the world's first operational military helicopters ([[Flettner Fl 282]]), the world's first rocket-powered fighter ([[Messerschmitt 163]])
*Missiles: The [[Pulse jet]]-powered [[V-1 flying bomb]] was the world's first [[cruise missile]], [[Rocket]]s progressed enormously: [[V-2 rocket]], [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]] rocket artillery and air-launched rockets.
*Specialised bombs: [[Butterfly Bomb|cluster bomb]]s, [[blockbuster bomb]]s, [[Bouncing bomb]]s, and [[bunker buster]]s.
*[[HEAT]], and [[High explosive squash head|HESH]] anti-armour warheads.
*[[Proximity fuze]] for shells, bombs and rockets. This fuze is designed to detonate an explosive automatically when close enough to the target to destroy it, so a direct hit is not required and time/place of closest approach does not need to be estimated. Magnetic torpedoes and mines also had a sort of proximity fuse.{{clarify|date=December 2013}}
*Guided weapons (by radio or trailing wires): glide bombs, crawling bombs and rockets - the precursors of today's [[precision-guided munition]]s existed between 1942–45, in the German [[Fritz X]] and [[Henschel Hs 293]] anti-ship ordnance designs, which along with the American [[Azon]], were all [[MCLOS]] radio-guided ordnance designs in World War II service.
*Self-guiding weapons: torpedoes (sound-seeking, compass-guided and looping), V1 missile (compass- and timer-guided), and the U.S. Navy's [[Bat (guided bomb)|Bat]] air-launched anti-ship glide ordnance, using [[active radar homing]] for the first time anywhere.
*Aiming devices for bombs, torpedoes, artillery and machine guns, using special purpose mechanical and electronic analog and (perhaps) digital "computers". The mechanical analog [[Norden bomb sight]] is a well-known example.
*The [[Nerve agent#History|first generation of nerve agents]] was invented and produced in Germany, but wasn't used as a weapon
*[[Napalm]] was developed, but did not see wide use until the [[Korean War]]
*[[Plastic explosives]] like [[Nobel 808]], Hexoplast 75, Compositions C and C2

===Small arms development===
New production methods for weapons such as stamping, riveting, and welding came into being to produce the number of arms needed. Design and production methods had advanced enough to manufacture weapons of reasonable reliability such as the [[PPSh-41]], [[PPS-42]], [[Sten]], [[Beretta Model 38]], [[MP 40]],  [[M3 submachine gun|M3 ''Grease Gun'']], [[Gewehr 43]], [[Thompson submachine gun]] and the [[M1 Garand rifle]]. Other Weapons commonly found during World War II include the American, Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR), M1 Carbine Rifle, as well as the Colt M1911 A-1; The Japanese Type 11 the Type 96 machine gun, and the Arisaka bolt-action rifles all were significant weapons used during the war.

World War II saw the establishment of the reliable [[semi-automatic rifle]], such as the American [[M1 Garand rifle|M1 Garand]] and, more importantly, of the first widely used [[assault rifle]]s, named after the German ''[[sturmgewehr]]s'' of the late war. Earlier renditions that hinted at this idea were that of the employment of the [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning Automatic Rifle]] and 1916 [[Fedorov Avtomat]] in a ''[[walking fire]]'' tactic in which men would advance on the enemy position showering it with a hail of lead. The Germans first developed the [[FG 42]] for its paratroopers in the assault and later the [[StG 44|Sturmgewehr 44]] (StG 44), the world's first [[assault rifle]], firing an [[intermediate cartridge]]; the FG 42's use of a full-powered rifle cartridge made it difficult to control.

Developments in [[machine gun]] technology culminated in the [[Maschinengewehr 42]] ([[MG42]]) which was of an advanced design unmatched at the time. It spurred post-war development on both sides of the upcoming [[Cold War]] and is still used by some armies to this day including the German [[Bundeswehr]]'s [[Rheinmetall MG3|MG 3]]. The [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3]], and many other [[Heckler &amp; Koch]] designs, came from its system of operation. The United States military meshed the operating system of the FG 42 with the [[Belt (firearm)|belt feed]] system of the MG42 to create the [[M60 machine gun]] used in the [[Vietnam War]].

Despite being overshadowed by self-loading/automatic rifles and sub-machine guns, bolt-action rifles remained the mainstay infantry weapon of many nations during World War II. When the United States entered World War II, there were not enough [[M1 Garand]] rifles available to American forces which forced the US to start producing more [[Springfield 1903 rifle|M1903]] rifles in order to act as a "stop gap" measure until sufficient quantities of M1 Garands were produced.

During the conflict, many new models of bolt-action rifles were produced as a result of lessons learned from the First World War with the designs of a number of bolt-action infantry rifles being modified in order to speed up production as well as to make the rifles more compact and easier to handle. Examples of bolt-action rifles that were used during World War II include the German [[Karabiner 98k|Mauser Kar98k]], the British [[Lee–Enfield| Lee–Enfield No.4]], and the [[Springfield 1903 rifle|Springfield M1903A3]]. During the course of World War II, bolt-action rifles and carbines were modified even further to meet new forms of warfare the armies of certain nations faced e.g. urban warfare and jungle warfare. Examples include the Soviet [[Mosin–Nagant| Mosin–Nagant M1944 carbine]], which were developed by the Soviets as a result of the Red Army's experiences with urban warfare e.g. the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], and the British [[Lee–Enfield| Lee–Enfield No.5 carbine]], that were developed for British and Commonwealth forces fighting the Japanese in South-East Asia and the Pacific.

When World War II ended in 1945, the small arms that were used in the conflict still saw action in the hands of the armed forces of various nations and guerrilla movements during and after the [[Cold War]] era. Nations like the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] provided many surplus, World War II-era small arms to a number of nations and political movements during the Cold War era as a pretext to providing more modern infantry weapons.

===The atomic bomb===
{{main|Manhattan Project}}
The massive research and development demands of the war included the Manhattan Project, the effort to quickly develop an [[atomic bomb]], or nuclear fission warhead. It was perhaps the most profound military development of the war, and had a great impact on the scientific community, among other things creating a network of [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories|national laboratories]] in the United States. The British however started their own nuclear weapons program in 1940, being the first country to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/00416632.pdf|publisher=Dennis C. Fakley|access-date=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due the potential radioactive fallout, the British considered the idea [[MAUD Committee|morally unacceptable]] and put it on hold. In 1947 the project was restarted and the first successful nuclear weapons test carried out on 3 October 1952 in [[Operation Hurricane]] and came info full service by 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/59244/The-History-of-the-UK-Nuclear-Weapons-Programme/#vars!panel=532105!|publisher=Nuclear-info.org|access-date=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain was also the first to come up with the idea of nuclear energy and hint at a potential for [[Timeline of nuclear weapons development|atomic weapons in 1933]]. It was patented in 1934, (British patent 630,726), which help to lead the way into the further research and later, the successful development of nuclear weapons.

In 1942, and with the threat of invasion by Germany still apparent, the United Kingdom dispatched around 20 British scientists and technical staff to America, along with their work, which had been carried out under the codename ''[[Tube Alloys]]'', to prevent the potential for vital information falling into enemy hands. The scientists formed the [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project]], where their work on uranium enrichment was instrumental in jump-starting the project.

The invention of the atomic bomb meant that a single aircraft could carry a weapon so powerful it could burn down entire cities, making conventional warfare against a nation with an arsenal of them suicidal. Following the conclusion of the European Theater in May 1945, two atomic bombs were [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|then employed]] against the [[Empire of Japan]] in August, hastening the end of the war, which averted the need for [[Operation Downfall|invading mainland Japan]].

The strategic importance of the bomb, and its even more powerful fusion-based successors, did not become fully apparent until the United States lost its monopoly on the weapon in the post-war era. The Soviet Union developed and tested their first fire weapon in 1949, based partially on information obtained from Soviet espionage in the United States. Competition between the two superpowers played a large part in the development of the [[Cold War]]. The strategic implications of such a massively destructive weapon still reverberate in the 21st century.

There was also a German nuclear energy project, including talk of an atomic weapon. This failed for a variety of reasons, most notably German [[Antisemitism]]. Half of continental theoretical physicists—including [[Einstein]], [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], [[Enrico Fermi]], and [[Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]]—who did much of their early study and research in Germany, were either Jewish or, in the case of Enrico Fermi, married to a Jew. [[Erwin Schrödinger]] had also left Germany for political reasons.  When they left Germany, the only leading nuclear physicist left in Germany was [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], who apparently dragged his feet on the project, or at best lacked the high morale that characterized the Los Alamos work. He made some faulty calculations suggesting that the Germans would need significantly more heavy water than was necessary.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} [[Otto Hahn]], the physical chemist who had the central part in the original discovery of fission, was another key figure in the project. The project was doomed due to insufficient resources, time, and a lack of Governmental interest.

The Empire of Japan was [[Japanese nuclear weapon program|also developing an atomic Bomb]], however, it floundered due to lack of resources despite gaining interest from the government.

The collaboration between the British and the Americans led to the [[1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement]] between the two nations, whereby American nuclear weapons technology was adapted for British use.

==Electronics, communications and intelligence==
[[File:Enigma.jpg|thumb|German [[Enigma machine|Enigma encryption machine]].]]
[[Electronics]] rose to prominence quickly in [[World War II]]. The [[British Empire|British]] developed and progressed electronic computers which were primarily used for breaking the “[[Enigma machine|Enigma]]” codes, which were [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] secret codes. These codes for radio messages were indecipherable to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. However, the meticulous work of code breakers based at Britain’s Bletchley Park cracked the secrets of German wartime communication, and played a crucial role in the final defeat of [[Germany]]. Americans also used electronic computers for equations, such as battlefield equations, ballistics, and more. Numerous small [[Computer|digital computers]] were also used. From calculating tables, to mechanical trajectory calculators, to some of the most advanced electronic computers. Soldiers would usually carry most of the electronic devices in their pockets, but since technology has developed, digital computers started to increase in size, which spacious command and control centres would have. Initial control centers that were embarked on ships and aircraft that established the networked computing, is so essential to our daily lives. While prior to the war few electronic devices were seen as important pieces of equipment, by the middle of the war instruments such as the British invented [[radar]] and [[Sonar#ASDIC|ASDIC (sonar)]] had become invaluable. Germany started the war ahead in some aspects of radar, but lost ground to research and development of the [[cavity magnetron]] in Britain and to later work at the "[[Radiation Laboratory]]" of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Half of the German theoretical physicists were Jewish and had emigrated or otherwise been lost to Germany long before WW II started.

Equipment designed for [[communication]]s and the [[signals intelligence|interception]] of those communications became critical. The Germans widely relied on the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] coding machine for encrypting communications. The British developed a [[Bombe#The British Bombe|new method]] for decoding Enigma benefiting from information given to Britain by the [[Polish Cipher Bureau#Gift to allies|Polish Cipher Bureau]], which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Macintyre, Ben|title=Bravery of thousands of Poles was vital in securing victory|work=The Times|location=London|date=10 December 2010|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rocketry==
Rocketry was used greatly in World War II. There were many different inventions and advances in rocketry, such as:

The '''V-1''', which is also known as the buzz bomb. This automatic aircraft is today known as a “cruise missile”. The V-1 was developed at [[Peenemünde Army Research Center]] by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. During initial development it was known by the codename "Cherry Stone". The first of the so-called ''[[V-weapons|Vergeltungswaffen]]'' series designed for [[Strategic bombing|terror bombing]] of London, the V-1 was fired from launch facilities along the French ([[Pas-de-Calais]]) and Dutch coasts. The first V-1 was launched at London on 13 June 1944), one week after (and prompted by) the successful [[Operation Overlord|Allied landings in Europe]]. At its peak, more than one hundred V-1s a day were fired at south-east England, 9,521 in total, decreasing in number as sites were overrun until October 1944, when the last V-1 site in range of Britain was overrun by Allied forces. After this, the V-1s were directed at the port of [[Antwerp]] and other targets in Belgium, with 2,448 V-1s being launched. The attacks stopped when the last launch site was overrun on 29 March 1945.

The '''V-2''' ([[German language|German]]: ''[[V-2 rocket|Vergeltungswaffe]] 2'', "Retribution Weapon 2"), technical name '''''[[V-2 rocket|Aggregat-4]]''''' (''A-4''), was the world's first long-range [[Guided missile cruiser|guided]] [[ballistic missile]]. The missile with [[liquid-propellant rocket]] engine was developed during the [[World War II|Second World War]] in [[Germany]] as a "[[V-weapons|vengeance weapon]]", designed to attack Allied cities as retaliation for the Allied bombings against German cities. The V-2 rocket was also the first artificial object to cross the [[Kármán line|boundary of space]].

These two rocketry advances took the lives of many civilians in London during the years 1944 and 1945.

== Consumer goods ==
After the war, many of the inventions created during World War II that were invented for the troops were later sold to the civilian population.

=== M&amp;M's  ===

During 1932, the creator of M&amp;M's, Forrest Mars Sr. moved to England, and began manufacturing Mars Bars for troops in the UK. During the Spanish Civil War, Forrest purportedly encountered troops eating small beads of chocolate that were encased in hard sugar shells. Upon returning to the US, he approached Bernie Murrie, the son of a Hershey's executive, to join him in his business venture as he anticipated a demand for chocolate and sugar during the war. After the design had been patented in 1941, a plant located in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], New Jersey, began production of M&amp;Ms that year. The candies were sold exclusively to the military when the US joined the war and were used as an easy way to provide the troops with chocolate on the battlefield without it melting so easily. After the war, in 1946, the candies again became available for the civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/mars.html |title=Inventor of the Week: Archive |publisher=Web.mit.edu |date= 2005 |accessdate=18 July 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310105331/http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/mars.html |archivedate = 10 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tensile structure''' is a [[construction]] of elements carrying only [[tension (physics)|tension]] and no [[compression (physical)|compression]] or [[bending]]. The term tensile should not be confused with [[tensegrity]], which is a structural form with both tension and compression elements.
Tensile structures are the most common type of [[thin-shell structure]]s.

Most tensile structures are supported by some form of compression or bending elements, such as masts (as in [[The O2 (London)|The O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], formerly the [[Millennium Dome]]), compression rings or beams.

A '''tensile membrane structure''' is most often used as a [[roof]], as they can economically and attractively span large distances. Tensile membrane structures may also be used as complete buildings, with a few common applications being sports facilities, warehousing and storage buildings, and exhibition venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://info.collinson.co.uk/tensile-fabric-structures-ultimate-guide|title=Tensile Fabric Structures: The Ultimate Guide (New For 2018)|last=plc|first=Collinson|website=info.collinson.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Olympiastadion Muenchen.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[Olympiastadion (Munich)|Olympiastadion]] in Munich makes extensive use of tensile roofing structures.]]
This form of construction has only become more rigorously analyzed and widespread in large structures in the latter part of the twentieth century. Tensile structures have long been used in [[tent]]s, where the [[guy rope]]s and tent poles provide pre-tension to the fabric and allow it to withstand loads.

Russian engineer [[Vladimir Shukhov]] was one of the first to develop practical calculations of stresses and deformations of tensile structures, shells and membranes. Shukhov designed eight tensile structures and [[thin-shell structure]]s exhibition pavilions for the [[Nizhny Novgorod Fair of 1896]], covering the area of 27,000 square meters. A more recent large-scale use of a membrane-covered tensile structure is the [[Sidney Myer Music Bowl]], constructed in 1958.

[[Antonio Gaudi]] used the concept in reverse to create a compression-only structure for the [[Colonia Guell Church]]. He created a hanging tensile model of the church to calculate the compression forces and to experimentally determine the column and vault geometries.

The concept was later championed by [[Germany|German]] architect and engineer [[Frei Otto]], whose first use of the idea was in the construction of the [[Expo 67 pavilions#National pavilions|West German pavilion at Expo 67]] in Montreal. Otto next used the idea for the roof of the Olympic Stadium for the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]].

Since the 1960s, [[tension (mechanics)|tensile]] structures have been promoted by [[design]]ers and [[engineer]]s such as [[Ove Arup]], [[Buro Happold]], Walter Bird of [[Taiyo Kogyo Corporation#Birdair|Birdair, Inc.]], [[Frei Otto]], [[Mahmoud Bodo Rasch]], [[Eero Saarinen]], [[Horst Berger]], [[Matthew Nowicki]], [[Jorg Schlaich|Jörg Schlaich]], the duo of [[Nicholas Goldsmith]] &amp; [[Todd Dalland]] at [[FTL Design &amp; Engineering Studio]] and [[David Geiger]].

Steady technological progress has increased the popularity of fabric-roofed structures. The low weight of the materials makes construction easier and cheaper than standard designs, especially when vast open spaces have to be covered.

===Membrane materials===

Common materials for doubly curved fabric structures are [[PTFE]]-coated [[fiberglass]] and [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]-coated [[polyester]].  These are woven materials with different strengths in different directions.  The [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] fibers (those fibers which are originally straight—equivalent to the starting fibers on a loom) can carry greater load than the [[weft]] or fill fibers, which are woven between the warp fibers.

Other structures make use of [[ETFE]] film, either as single layer or in cushion form (which can be inflated, to provide good insulation properties or for aesthetic effect—as on the [[Allianz Arena]] in [[Munich]]).  ETFE cushions can also be etched with patterns in order to let different levels of light through when inflated to different levels. 

In daylight, fabric membrane translucency offers soft diffused naturally lit spaces, while at night, artificial lighting can be used to create an ambient exterior luminescence.  They are most often supported by a structural frame as they cannot derive their strength from double curvature.

===Cables===
[[Image:IRB-7-MUDDY2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Simple suspended bridge working entirely in tension]]

Cables can be of [[mild steel]], [[High-strength low-alloy steel|high strength steel]] (drawn carbon steel), [[stainless steel]], [[polyester]] or [[Aramid|aramid fibres]]. Structural cables are made of a series of small strands twisted or bound together to form a much larger cable. Steel cables are either spiral strand, where circular rods are twisted together and "glued" using a polymer, or locked coil strand, where individual interlocking steel strands form the cable (often with a spiral strand core).

Spiral strand is slightly weaker than locked coil strand. Steel spiral strand cables have a [[Young's modulus]], ''E'' of 150±10&amp;nbsp;kN/mm² (or 150±10 [[gigapascal|GPa]]) and come in sizes from 3 to 90&amp;nbsp;mm diameter.{{Citation needed|reason=The information is probably country/manufacturer specific and needs a source.|date=April 2016}} Spiral strand suffers from construction stretch, where the strands compact when the cable is loaded. This is normally removed by pre-stretching the cable and cycling the load up and down to 45% of the ultimate tensile load.

Locked coil strand typically has a Young's Modulus of 160±10&amp;nbsp;kN/mm² and comes in sizes from 20&amp;nbsp;mm to 160&amp;nbsp;mm diameter.

The properties of the individuals strands of different materials are shown in the table below, where UTS is [[ultimate tensile strength]], or the breaking load:

===Structural forms===

[[Air-supported structure]]s are a form of tensile structures where the fabric envelope is supported by pressurised air only.

The majority of fabric structures derive their strength from their doubly curved shape. By forcing the fabric to take on double-curvature the fabric gains sufficient [[stiffness]] to withstand the loads it is subjected to (for example [[wind]] and [[snow]] loads). In order to induce an adequately doubly curved form it is most often necessary to pretension or prestress the fabric or its supporting structure.

===Form-finding===

The behaviour of structures which depend upon prestress to attain their strength is non-linear, so anything other than a very simple cable has, until the 1990s, been very difficult to design. The most common way to design doubly curved fabric structures was to construct scale models of the final buildings in order to understand their behaviour and to conduct form-finding exercises. Such scale models often employed stocking material or tights, or soap film, as they behave in a very similar way to structural fabrics (they cannot carry shear).

Soap films have uniform stress in every direction and require a closed boundary to form. They naturally form a minimal surface—the form with minimal area and embodying minimal energy. They are however very difficult to measure. For a large film, its weight can seriously affect its form.

For a membrane with curvature in two directions, the basic equation of equilibrium is:

&lt;math&gt;w = \frac{{t_1}}{{R_1}} + \frac{{t_2}}{{R_2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

*''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the principal radii of curvature for soap films or the directions of the warp and weft for fabrics
*''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the tensions in the relevant directions
*''w'' is the load per square metre

Lines of [[principal curvature]] have no twist and intersect other lines of principal curvature at right angles.

A [[geodesic]] or [[geodesy|geodetic]] line is usually the shortest line between two points on the surface. These lines are typically used when defining the cutting pattern seam-lines. This is due to their relative straightness after the planar cloths have been generated, resulting in lower cloth wastage and closer alignment with the fabric weave.

In a pre-stressed but unloaded surface ''w'' = 0, so &lt;math&gt;\frac{{t_1}}{{R_1}} = -\frac{{t_2}}{{R_2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

In a soap film surface tensions are uniform in both directions, so ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = −''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

It is now possible to use powerful [[non-linear]] [[numerical analysis]] programs (or [[finite element analysis]]) to formfind and design fabric and cable structures. The programs must allow for large deflections.

The final shape, or form, of a fabric structure depends upon:

*shape, or pattern, of the fabric
*the geometry of the supporting structure (such as masts, cables, ringbeams etc.)
*the pretension applied to the fabric or its supporting structure

[[Image:HyperbolicParaboloid.png|thumb|right|[[Hyperbolic paraboloid]]]]
It is important that the final form will not allow [[ponding]] of water, as this can deform the membrane and lead to local failure or progressive failure of the entire structure.

Snow loading can be a serious problem for membrane structure, as the snow often will not flow off the structure as water will. For example, this has in the past caused the (temporary) collapse of the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]], an air-inflated structure in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].  Some structures prone to [[ponding]] use heating to melt snow which settles on them.

[[Image:Saddle point.png|thumb|left|Saddle Shape]]
There are many different doubly curved forms, many of which have special mathematical properties. The most basic doubly curved from is the saddle shape, which can be a [[hyperbolic paraboloid]] (not all saddle shapes are hyperbolic paraboloids). This is a double [[ruled surface]] and is often used in both in lightweight shell structures (see [[hyperboloid structures]]). True ruled surfaces are rarely found in tensile structures. Other forms are [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anticlastic anticlastic] saddles, various radial, conical tent forms and any combination of them.

===Pretension===
'''Pretension''' is tension artificially induced in the structural elements in addition to any self-weight or imposed loads they may carry. It is used to ensure that the normally very flexible structural elements remain stiff under all possible loads.

A day to day example of pretension is a shelving unit supported by wires running from floor to ceiling. The wires hold the shelves in place because they are tensioned – if the wires were slack the system would not work.

Pretension can be applied to a membrane by stretching it from its edges or by pretensioning cables which support it and hence changing its shape. The level of pretension applied determines the shape of a membrane structure.

===Alternative form-finding approach===
The alternative approximated approach to the form-finding problem solution is based on the total energy balance of a grid-nodal system. Due to its physical meaning this approach is called the [[Stretched grid method|Stretched Grid Method (SGM)]].

==Simple mathematics of cables==

===Transversely and uniformly loaded cable===

A uniformly loaded cable spanning between two supports forms a curve intermediate between a [[catenary]] curve and a [[parabola]]. The simplifying assumption can be made that it approximates a circular arc (of radius ''R'').

[[Image:Catenary cable diagram.svg|700px|left]]

'''By [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]]:'''

The horizontal and vertical reactions :

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{{wS^2}}{{8d}}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{{wS}}{{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

'''By [[geometry]]:'''

The length of the cable:

:&lt;math&gt;L = 2R\arcsin\frac{{S}}{{2R}}&lt;/math&gt;

The tension in the cable:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \sqrt{H^2+V^2}&lt;/math&gt;

By substitution:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \sqrt{\left(\frac{wS^2}{8d}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{wS}{2}\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The tension is also equal to:

:&lt;math&gt;T = wR&lt;/math&gt;

The extension of the cable upon being loaded is (from [[Hooke's Law]], where the axial stiffness, ''k,'' is equal to &lt;math&gt;k = \frac{{EA}}{{L}}&lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;e = \frac{{TL}}{{EA}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is the [[Young's modulus]] of the cable and ''A'' is its cross-sectional [[area]].

If an initial pretension, &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; is added to the cable, the extension becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;e = L - L_0 = \frac{{L_0(T-T_0)}}{{EA}}&lt;/math&gt;

Combining the above equations gives:

:&lt;math&gt;{\frac{{L_0(T-T_0)}}{{EA}}}+L_0 = \frac{{2T\arcsin(\frac{{wS}}{{2T}})}}{{w}}&lt;/math&gt;

By plotting the left hand side of this equation against ''T,'' and plotting the right hand side on the same axes, also against ''T,'' the intersection will give the actual equilibrium tension in the cable for a given loading ''w'' and a given pretension &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt;.

===Cable with central point load===

[[Image:point-loaded cable.svg|800px|left]]
{{-}}
A similar solution to that above can be derived where:

'''By equilibrium:'''

:&lt;math&gt;W = \frac{{4Td}}{{L}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;d = \frac{{WL}}{{4T}}&lt;/math&gt;

'''By geometry:'''

:&lt;math&gt;L = \sqrt{S^2 + 4d^2} = \sqrt{S^2 + 4\left(\frac{{WL}}{{4T}}\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

This gives the following relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;L_0 + \frac{{L_0(T-T_0)}}{{EA}} = \sqrt{S^2 + 4\left(\frac{{W(L_0+\frac{{L_0(T-T_0)}}{{EA}})}}{{4T}}\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

As before, plotting the left hand side and right hand side of the equation against the tension, ''T,'' will give the equilibrium tension for a given pretension, &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; and load, ''W''.

==Tensioned cable oscillations==

The fundamental [[natural frequency]], ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of tensioned cables is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;f_1=\frac{\sqrt{(\frac{{T}}{{m}})}}{{2L}}&lt;/math&gt;

where: ''T'' = tension in [[newton (unit)|newton]]s, ''m'' = [[mass]] in kilograms and ''L'' = span length.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3021">'''Thailand Science Park''' (TSP) is in Tha Khlong, [[Khlong Luang District]], [[Pathum Thani Province]] near [[Rangsit, Thailand|Rangsit]], north of [[Bangkok]].  Managed by the [[National Science and Technology Development Agency]] (NSTDA), under the [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Thailand)|Ministry of Science and Technology]]. Thailand Science Park was set up in 2002. TSP is part of Thailand's efforts to strengthen its capabilities in research and innovation. It is the country's largest science and technology research park. 

Corporate tenants conducting research and development in Thailand Science Park receive maximum investment privileges from the [[Thailand Board of Investment]] (BOI).

==Organisation and infrastructure==
TSP houses NSTDA headquarters and four national research centers:

Facilities include a library, an infirmary, a bank, a savings cooperative, a residence hall, a nursery ([[daycare center]]), a grocery store, two food courts, and a number of coffee shops and restaurants. In addition to advanced facilities and business space, the TSP offers a full range of value-added services to support technology businesses. 

The park is near the [[Asian Institute of Technology]], [[Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology]], and [[Thammasat University]]. Also in the park is the Thailand Technology Information Access Center (now the Science and Technology Knowledge Service Center or STKS), a provider of on-line information services.

A '''tunnel finisher''' is a [[machine]] that removes [[wrinkles]] from [[garments]] and is often used in the [[textile industry]]. As with other industrial pressing equipment, this machine is employed to improve the quality and look of a textile product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Textiles Technology|last=Cresswell|first=Lesley|publisher=Nelson Thornes Ltd.|year=2004|isbn=0748790195|location=Cheltenham|pages=xxii}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a chamber called a "tunnel" and includes a conveyor fed unit through which the garments are steamed and dried.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Apparel Manufacturing Technology|last=Karthik|first=T.|last2=Ganesan|first2=P.|last3=Gopalakrishnan|first3=D.|publisher=CRC Press|year=2017|isbn=9781498763752|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=204-205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The machine also features hook systems; air curtain entrance to eliminate moisture or condensation; cotton care and roller units; exhaust steam, and a preconditioning module.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Process ==
Most garments are shipped by [[ship transport|sea freight]] from the [[country]] of [[Manufacturing|production]]. They get very wrinkled because of the [[box]] packing being used. In the receiving country, they are unpacked and put on a [[clothes hanger]]. Those hangers are sent via [[Automation|automated]] transport through the tunnel with a speed up to 3,000 garments per hour. These garments are then sent to a room to be steamed and dried.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=GCSE Textiles Technology for OCR|last=Clarkson|first=Carey|last2=March|first2=Jayne|last3=Palmer|first3=Joy|publisher=Heinemann Educational Publishers|year=2002|isbn=0435416669|location=Oxford|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The machine processes each garment through several stages. First, the garment passes through a steam chamber to make the [[fabric]] moldable. Then wrinkles are removed by a strong hot air flow alongside the garments. Finally, the garment is dried by cooler air before it leaves the tunnel finisher. In the case of garments, smaller areas such as collars require further pressing using other equipment such as [[Clothes iron|steam iron]] for a better finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Textiles Technology to GCSE|last=Down|first=Jane|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=0198328133|location=Oxford|pages=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tunnel finisher is also used in [[laundry|laundries]] and [[dry cleaner]]s to remove wrinkles from garments after washing or [[dry cleaning]].

== Classifications ==
Tunnel finishers can be grouped into two different classifications, "wide body" or "narrow body."  "Wide body" machines are designed for high production finishing of blended garments wet-to-dry, damp-to-dry and or dry-to-dry.  "Narrow body" machines are designed for shoulder-to-shoulder processing and are best suited for the dry-to-dry finishing of garments.  However; they are capable of damp-to-dry finishing at slower production speeds.  These units are ideal for dry cleaners, hotel laundries, institutional laundries and other on-premises laundry applications. The smaller capacity version of the tunnel finisher is called "cabinet tunnel" and this typically capable of automated processing of separate batches of 4 or 5 garments at the same time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The production capacity for this smaller equipment is 10 percent of the tunnel finisher.

The '''Windshear Full Scale Rolling Road Wind Tunnel''' is an automotive [[wind tunnel]] in [[Concord, North Carolina]]. 

In January 2008 Wind Shear, a division of US machine tool builder [[Haas Automation]], completed construction on one of the most advanced automotive wind tunnels in the world. The full-scale tunnel is located adjacent to [[Concord Regional Airport]] in Concord, North Carolina. The commercial operation was designed for vehicles from race industries: [[stock car]], [[Formula One]], [[American Championship Car Racing|Indy car]], [[drag racing]], as well as [[production car]] industries.

Wind Shear's tunnel is a closed air circuit, temperature-controlled system built around a rolling road. The rolling road, akin to a giant treadmill, is 10 ft wide by 29.5 ft long (3 m x 9 m) and accommodates full-size cars. Air and rolling road speeds are coordinated up to {{convert|180|mph|m/s|abbr=on}}. Air temperature, critical to repeatable data collection, is maintained at a constant {{convert|75|°F|°C|abbr=on}}, plus or minus one degree. Air is moved through the massive {{convert|15000|sqft|abbr=on}} air circuit at the maximum rate of {{convert|47500|cuft|m3|abbr=on}} per second by a {{convert|5100|hp|abbr=on}} motor and 29 carbon fiber blades {{convert|22|ft}} in diameter.

In the [[wind tunnel]] industry, size is everything.{{Vague|date=February 2017}} The blockage effect is the condition where air flow in the [[wind tunnel]] is partially blocked by the vehicle. The blockage becomes more critical as the cross section of the test vehicle increases relative to the size of nozzle and airstream. As the vehicle increases in size relative to the nozzle, test data become less reliable as increased blockage effects the quality of the actual windstream.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scs-europe.net/services/ess2002/PDF/manuf-3.pdf NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF THE BLOCKAGE EFFECT IN WIND-TUNNELS]&lt;/ref&gt; Windshear's solution was to build a sufficiently large air circuit. Nozzle size is a relatively large 180 square feet (16.7 square meters).
