The [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA), the governing alliance in India [[Indian general election, 2004|elected in 2004]], faced its first [[confidence vote]] in the [[Lok Sabha]] (the lower house of Parliament) on 22 July 2008 after the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]]-led [[Left Front (West Bengal)|Left Front]] withdrew support over India approaching the [[IAEA]] for the [[Indo-US nuclear deal]]. The vote was so crucial that the UPA and the opposition parties summoned MPs from their sick beds and even from prison cells to take part in the vote, which was eventually won by the Government.&lt;ref name="itgo"&gt;[http://www.itgo.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;issueid=&amp;id=6743&amp;sectionid=5&amp;secid=27&amp;Itemid=1 Second day of trust motion] India Today Group Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indian government survives vote "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7519860.stm|title=Indian government survives vote |date=22 July 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-07-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080723001456/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7519860.stm| archivedate= 23 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expulsions ==
As a result of not obeying the instructions issued by their political parties, many MPs were expelled as an aftermath of the vote.

The '''2016 Icelandic anti-government protests''' were a series of protests against the Icelandic government following the release of the [[Panama Papers]].

==Background==

In 2007, [[Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson]] and his wife, Anna Sigurlaug Pálsdóttir, set up Wintris Inc via the law firm [[Mossack Fonseca]]. The company was registered in the [[British Virgin Islands]], "a well-known offshore tax haven."&lt;ref name=mustgo /&gt; In January 2009, Sigmundur Davíð was elected as the Chairman of the [[Progressive Party (Iceland)|Progressive Party]], and in the [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2009|2009 parliamentary election]] was elected as a member of the [[Althing]]. On the last day of 2009, Sigmundur Davíð sold his share in the company to his wife for $1, just before a new law came into force that would have forced him to declare his ownership as a conflict of interest. Wintris Inc lost millions of dollars as a result of the financial crisis.&lt;ref name="erlanger"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Erlanger|first1=Steven|title=‘Panama Papers’ Leaks Put Iceland Prime Minister Under Pressure to Quit|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/world/europe/panama-papers-leaks-put-iceland-leader-under-pressure-to-quit.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FIceland|accessdate=10 April 2016|work=New York Times|date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2013|2013 parliamentary election]], the [[Progressive Party (Iceland)|Progressive Party]] and the [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]], both of which had won 19 seats, formed a coalition government. [[Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson]], as Chairman of the Progressive Party, became [[Prime Minister of Iceland|Prime Minister]], and [[Bjarni Benediktsson (born 1970)|Bjarni Benediktsson]], Chairman of the Independence Party, became Minister of Finance. As Prime Minister, Sigmundur Davíð pledged to fight demands from foreign creditors for full repayment by the Icelandic banks.&lt;ref name="faces"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henley|first1=Jon|last2=Bowers|first2=Simon|title=Icelandic PM faces no confidence vote over Panama Papers disclosures|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/04/icelandic-pm-gunnlaugsson-faces-no-confidence-vote-panama-papers-wife-offshore|accessdate=9 April 2016|work=The Guardian|date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, it was revealed that Anna Sigurlaug Pálsdóttir, the wife of the [[Prime Minister of Iceland|Prime Minister]], [[Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson]], was a creditor for Iceland's three failed banks, [[Landsbanki]], [[Kaupthing Bank]] and [[Glitnir (bank)|Glitnir]]. Her company, Wintris Inc, was claiming a total of ISK 515&amp;nbsp;million from the three banks, due to losses incurred during the financial crisis. Following this revelation, a number of Icelandic MPs criticised the arrangement, with [[Svandís Svavarsdóttir]], a former minister, calling for the government to resign and for new elections.&lt;ref name="mustgo"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tax haven scandal: "Government must go!"|url=http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2016/03/18/tax_haven_scandal_government_must_go/|accessdate=9 April 2016|work=Iceland Monitor|date=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Panama Papers]], released on 3 April 2016, not only Sigmundur Davíð, but also the finance minister, [[Bjarni Benediktsson (born 1970)|Bjarni Benediktsson]], and the interior minister, [[Ólöf Nordal]], were implicated in having offshore tax arrangements. The news was also broadcast in Iceland on a special edition of the current affairs program, [[Kastljós]].&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gittins|first1=Charles|title=REVIEW: "So what’s going on in Iceland?"|url=http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2016/04/06/review_so_what_s_going_on_in_iceland/|accessdate=9 April 2016|work=Iceland Monitor|date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial protests==

In the wake of the Panama Papers revelations, on 3 April people began to use [[Facebook]] to organise a protest for the following day. According to Facebook, 10,000 people were planning to attend the protest.&lt;ref name="prepare"&gt;{{cite news|title=Police prepare for large protests at parliament square|url=http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/news/2016/04/04/panama_papers_police_prepare_for_large_protests_at_/|accessdate=9 April 2016|work=Iceland Monitor|date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At midday on 4 April, Sigmundur Davíð did a live television interview during which he said he would not be resigning, but did apologise for his performance in an earlier television interview.&lt;ref name="not"&gt;{{cite news|title=Iceland PM: "I will not resign" |url=http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2016/04/04/iceland_pm_i_will_not_resign/|accessdate=9 April 2016|work=Iceland Monitor|date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest was scheduled to take place at 5pm, and people slowly began gathering in [[Austurvöllur]], the park just outside of [[Alþingishúsið]], the building that houses the [[Althing]]. One early protester was arrested for throwing tubs of [[skyr]] at the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iceland Parliament pelted with skyr|url=http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2016/04/04/iceland_parliament_pelted_with_skyr/|accessdate=13 April 2016|work=Iceland Monitor|date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the protests began, members of the Althing were still sitting in a parliamentary session. The size of the crowd was estimated to be between 9,000 and 23,000 people by different sources, although was acknowledged to be one of the biggest political demonstrations in Iceland's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Snowden: Yesterday's protest the largest in world history? 6.7% of Icelanders participated|url=http://icelandmag.visir.is/article/snowden-yesterdays-protest-largest-world-history-67-icelanders-participated|accessdate=13 April 2016|work=Iceland Magazine|date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robert|first1=Zoe|title=Record Number of Icelanders Protest Over Panama Papers Scandal|url=http://icelandreview.com/news/2016/04/04/record-number-icelanders-protest-over-panama-papers-scandal|accessdate=13 April 2016|work=Iceland Review|date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planned parliament session for the following day, 5 April, was cancelled.&lt;ref name="prepare"/&gt;&lt;ref name="demand"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands demand PM resign over Panama Papers|url=http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2016/04/04/thousands_demand_pm_resign_over_panama_papers/|accessdate=9 April 2016|work=Iceland Monitor|date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of 5 April, Sigmundur Davíð announced via Facebook his intention to dissolve parliament and call early elections. Later on that morning, he met with the [[President of Iceland]], [[Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson]], who had just returned from a private visit to the [[United States]]. During the meeting, the Prime Minister asked the President to dissolve parliament and call new elections. Ólafur Ragnar refused this request, on the grounds that the Prime Minister had not consulted his coalition partner, the [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]], on this issue. The President also said that it was "inappropriate" to drag him into disputes between political parties.&lt;ref name="refuse"&gt;{{cite news|title=President refuses to authorise PM to dissolve parliament|url=http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2016/04/05/president_refuses_to_authorise_pm_to_dissolve_parli/|accessdate=9 April 2016|work=Iceland Monitor|date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unrav"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fontaine|first1=Paul|title=The Unraveling Of A Government: The Panama Papers And Iceland|url=https://grapevine.is/mag/feature/2016/04/08/the-unraveling-of-a-government-the-panama-papers-and-iceland/|accessdate=11 April 2016|work=Reykjavik Grapevine|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the afternoon on 5 April, a meeting of Progressive Party MPs concluded that Sigmundur Davíð should resign as Prime Minister. The meeting proposed [[Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson]], who was [[Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture (Iceland)|Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture]], as his successor.&lt;ref name="tores"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gunnlaugsson to resign as PM, party agrees|url=http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2016/04/05/gunnlaugsson_to_resign_as_pm_party_agrees/|accessdate=9 April 2016|work=Iceland Monitor|date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, another protest took place in Austurvöllur, with a smaller crowd than the day before. At 6:30pm, the protesters left Austurvöllur and began protesting outside the [[Progressive Party (Iceland)|Progressive Party]] headquarters in Hverfisgata, a different part of Reykjavik. Protesters were calling for the government to resign and for new elections.&lt;ref name="escalate"&gt;{{cite news|title=Protests escalate at Reykjavik parliament square|url=http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2016/04/05/protests_escalate_at_reykjavik_parliament_square/|accessdate=9 April 2016|work=Iceland Monitor|date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; That evening, foreign correspondents revealed a government press release saying that the Prime Minister "has not resigned" and was handing over the office to Sigurður Ingi "for an unspecified amount of time."&lt;ref name="notresigned"&gt;{{cite news|title=Prime Minister has not resigned - sends press release to international media|url=http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2016/04/05/prime_minister_has_not_resigned_sends_press_release/|accessdate=9 April 2016|work=Iceland Monitor|date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This confusion of the matter was condemned by a number of opposition politicians, as well as Icelandic historian Guðni Th. Johannesson.&lt;ref name="confusion"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fontaine|first1=Paul|title=Confusion And Anger In Wake Of Non-Resignation Statement|url=http://grapevine.is/news/2016/04/06/confusion-and-anger-in-wake-of-non-resignation-statement/|accessdate=11 April 2016|work=Reykjavik Grapevine|date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New government==

On 7 April, a new government was appointed, with [[Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson]] as the Prime Minister. [[Gunnar Bragi Sveinsson]], the former foreign affairs minister, replaced Sigurður Ingi as the agriculture and fisheries minister. Lilja Dögg Alfreðsdóttir, who is not a sitting MP, was brought in as the new foreign affairs minister, on the personal recommendation of former Prime Minister Sigmundur Davíð.&lt;ref name="newgovt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elliott|first1=Alex|title=New Government Confirmed|url=http://icelandreview.com/news/2016/04/07/new-government-confirmed|accessdate=13 April 2016|work=Iceland Review|date=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government announced early elections for autumn, saying that it was necessary for them to stay in power to complete the removal of capital controls.&lt;ref name="sigur"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sigurdardottir|first1=Ragnhildur|title=Iceland government appoints new PM, to call early elections|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-panama-tax-iceland-idUKKCN0X31B3|accessdate=11 April 2016|work=Reuters|date=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests taking place in Reykjavík coincided with the appointment of the new government, which took place at [[Bessastaðir]].&lt;ref name="valdi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Valdimarsson|first1=Omar|title=Opposition, Protesters Press On as Iceland Gets New Premier|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-06/icelanders-protest-for-third-night-as-coalition-seeks-to-hold-on|accessdate=13 April 2016|work=Bloomberg|date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April, the new government was in parliament for the first time. In the morning, ministers discussed their plans, strategies and ongoing projects. In the afternoon, the focus was on the opposition's motion of no confidence, and vote on a new election. At least three coalition MPs had expressed dismay at the government's actions before the votes were taken.&lt;ref name="latest"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elliott|first1=Alex|title=Iceland Political Crisis: The Latest|url=http://icelandreview.com/news/2016/04/08/iceland-political-crisis-latest|accessdate=13 April 2016|work=Iceland Review|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government survived the two votes put forward by the opposition parties, winning the no confidence 38-25, and the vote for new elections 37-26. Following the votes, [[Bjarni Benediktsson (born 1970)|Bjarni Benediktsson]] told reporters that it had been "a very tough week."&lt;ref name="mure"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dickie|first1=Mure|title=Iceland protesters step up pressure over Panama Papers|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/695f42d0-ff10-11e5-99cb-83242733f755.html|accessdate=11 April 2016|work=Financial Times|date=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further protests==

Protests resumed with increased further on 9 April, when some estimates put the number of protesters in attendance at 14,000.&lt;ref name="hafs"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hafstad|first1=Vala|title=Saturday’s Panama Papers Protest in Pictures|url=http://icelandreview.com/news/2016/04/11/saturdays-panama-papers-protest-pictures|accessdate=13 April 2016|work=Iceland Review|date=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ARTHUR''' is an acronym for "[[Artillery|'''Art'''illery]] '''Hu'''nting [[Radar|'''R'''adar]]", is a [[Counter-battery radar]]
system originally developed jointly for and in close co-operation with the [[Norwegian Armed Forces|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish Armed Forces|Swedish]] armed forces by [[Ericsson Microwave Systems]] in both Sweden and Norway.  

It is a mobile, [[passive electronically scanned array]] C-Band [[radar]] for the purpose of enemy [[field artillery]] acquisition and
was developed for the primary role as the core element of a [[brigade]] or [[Division (military)|division]] level [[counter battery]] sensor system.  The vehicle carrying the radar was originally a [[Bandvagn 206]] developed and produced by [[Hägglunds]], but is now more often delivered on trucks with [[Intermodal container|ISO fasteners]].   The radar is now developed by [[Saab AB|SAAB]] Electronic Defence Systems (after EMW was sold to SAAB in June 2006) and Saab Technologies Norway AS.

==Role==
The ARTHUR detects [[hostile]] artillery by tracking projectiles in flight. The original ARTHUR Mod A can locate [[howitzer|guns]] at 15 - 20 km and 120 mm [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s at 30 - 35 km with a [[circular error probable]] of 0.45% of range. This is accurate enough for effective counter-battery fire by friendly [[Artillery battery|artillery batteries]]. ARTHUR can operate as a stand-alone medium-range weapons locating radar or a long-range weapon locating system, consisting of two to four radars working in coordination. This flexibility enables the system to maintain a constant [[surveillance]] of an area of interest. 

The upgraded ARTHUR Mod B meets the [[British Army]]'s [[MAMBA]] requirement for locating guns, mortars or rockets.  It can locate guns at 20 - 25 km and 120 mm mortars at 35 - 40 km with a circular probable error of 0.35% of range. MAMBA was successfully used by the British Army in Iraq and Afghanistan.

ARTHUR Mod C has a larger antenna and can detect guns at 31 km, mortars at 55 km and rockets at 50 - 60 km depending on their size, and locate targets at a rate of 100 per minute with CEP 0.2% of range for guns and rockets and 0.1% for mortars.

It can be carried by a [[C-130]] or slung under a heavy lift helicopter such as a [[CH-47_Chinook|Chinook]]. Its air mobility allows it for use by light and rapid reaction forces such as airborne and [[Marine (military)|marine]] units.

===Nordic Battle Group===
The use of the ARTHUR in [[Nordic Battle Group]]s will primarily concentrate on preventing the use of artillery [[barrage (artillery)|barrage]]s in civilian areas, since the radar can identify an artillery unit guilty of targeting civilians. It will also be used to warn friendly mission troops of incoming [[indirect fire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artreg.mil.se/article.php?id=14821 |title=ISTAR och artillerilokaliseringsradarn ARTHUR |accessdate=17 January 2007 |publisher=[[Swedish Armed Forces]] |language=Swedish |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225933/http://www.artreg.mil.se/article.php?id=14821 |archivedate=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational Modes==
ARTHUR can be operated in two main modes: Weapon locating and Fire direction. Weapon locating is used to determine the location of the guns, mortars or rocket launchers that fired and their target area. Fire direction is used to adjust the fire of own artillery onto target coordinates.

===Weapon Locating===
When locating enemy artillery, the radar tracks the up-going trajectory of shells, calculates their points of origin and impact and, with other information, displays it to the radar operator(s). Depending on national tactics, techniques, procedures, the commander's orders and the situation, this information may be used to alert any troops in the impact area and engage the hostile batteries with counter-battery fire. If the users have digital communications networks these messages may be sent automatically. 
 
The ARTHUR can determine whether the artillery piece is of [[Field artillery|artillery]]-type, [[rocket artillery|rocket]]-type or [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]-type based upon the curve of the trajectory, the munition's speed, and its range.

===Fire Direction===
When in Fire direction mode the radar calculates the expected impact location of the friendly fire. From this corrections are calculated and reported to hit the target coordinates. 

Sweden also uses the radar for 'fall of shot' calibration.  

==Threats==
Radars are easy to detect and locate if the enemy has the necessary [[ELINT]]/[[Electronic Support Measures|ESM]] capability.  The consequences of this detection are likely to be attack by artillery fire or aircraft (including [[anti-radiation missiles]]) or [[Electronic countermeasure|ECM]].  In other circumstances ground attack with direct fire or short range indirect fire are the main threat.  The usual measures against the first are using a [[radar horizon]] to screen from ground-based detection, minimising transmission time, deploying radars singly and moving frequently.  Swedish ARTHUR units usually operate in groups of three that guard the immediate surroundings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6072">'''Afghanistan Institute of Peace'''  (AFGIP) an independent think-tank headquartered in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]]. A non-governmental organization (NGO) and a non-for-profit organization, it advocates for positive community change and peacebuilding initiatives in Afghanistan. 

The Institute works with local Afghan peace-builders and international partners to bring sustainable positive change in Afghan communities, particularly in the conflict zones. AFGIP has a nationwide local peace-builders team which works with international experts in a unique approach to build local capacity of community people and establish the foundation for positive community change initiatives. AFGIP works with the community people using community's available assets. AFGIP believes that scaling up the capacity of community people and the use of their available resources including human energy will lead to long-term stability and peace in these communities. They are conducting research studies to understand the roots and causes of conflict in conflict zones and simultaneously prepare a response strategy per district to react and to respond to the community level issues by using the early warning signs and data. Their mission is to promote positive community change initiatives and youth empowerment through the religious channels to bringing long-term peace in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afgip.org/index.php/about|title=ABOUT US|website=www.afgip.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==
AFGIP was officially registered with the Afghanistan Government as an NGO in 2015. However, the organization was heavily involved in peacebuilding initiatives long before this which was structured as a voluntarily mechanism where a number of like-minded peacebuilders were working on peacebuilding activities. The founder and CEO of AFGIP, Mr. [https://www.usip.org/public-education/students/yasar-ahmadzai Yasar Ahmadzai], was featured and recognized for his peacebuilding efforts by different organizations, including the United State Institute of Peace (USIP) and World Peace Center. In 2015 he was featured by USIP among the top 10 peace builders across the globe for the year 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usip.org/public-education/students/yasar-ahmadzai |title=Yasar Ahmadzai &amp;#124; United States Institute of Peace |publisher=Usip.org |date= |accessdate=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2015/09/05/afghan-journalist-among-world%E2%80%99s-top-10-peace-builders|title=Afghan journalist among world’s top 10 peace builders|website=www.pajhwok.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Afghanistan Conflict and AFGIP==
More than four decades of conflict have fundamentally destroyed trust in peacekeeping and has built dangerous alternatives for the Afghan people to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.peaceinsight.org/conflicts/afghanistan/|title=Afghanistan: Conflict and peace|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it’s not impossible, but also not easy, peacebuilding and peacekeeping can be built in [[Afghanistan]]. The question of how is contingent on how we preserve and build peace. The approach the AFGIP so far took has been focusing on youths and building youth peace ambassadors. They believe that youth extremism has become a serious challenge not only to the Afghan government but to the entire region and mainly to the families where these youths are coming from. To construct the efforts made in this regard by various stakeholder in the past, AFGIP is working on a bottom-up approach to raise awareness and conduct peace sensitization in the hotspot communities. Looking back not undermining what has been achieved in regards to peacebuilding efforts in Afghanistan, the impact of what has been done is limited to the main cities where already peoples’ access to information and resources are high. So, to encounter peace in the hotspots AFGIP focused on the conflict zones and this became a priority for them since they are formally established. While all the provinces, but particularly the South, East, and South-Western provinces of Afghanistan are the main target of the insurgents that drives the youths to extremism and became the hotspots in last decade and so. AFGIP by intervening in these hotspots through its violence prevention activities work with religious networks and through families to provide alternatives to the at-risk youths in these communities. Previous interventions to address and prevent youth [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism extremism] in these provinces have been relatively unsuccessful, due in part, to poor targeting and unrealistic assessment of the true underlying causes of youth extremism in these hotspots. So to not repeat the same mistake, AFGIP took a bottom-up approach which adopts a multi-prong approach to address at-risk youths and tackle extremism in a different but practical lens.  Their approach allows for a broader engagement which provides an opportunity to gradually transform the targeted hotspots into a peaceful environment where youth will actively play their roles to build long-term peace in their communities.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afgip.org/index.php/mission-history|title=MISSION|first=Super|last=User|website=www.afgip.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approach==
[[Peace]] is the most important element in any community and where it is lacking, it creates moments of anxiety that stifles growth. Drive the force of the community, especially the youths, in the wrong directions and can contribute to unstable environments that threaten everything in that community.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In particular AFGIP:    

* Establish mechanisms and take preventative measure to work with at-risk youths
* Build trust and communication opportunities in the communities  by squeezing the gaps that often mislead the youths and drove them to the insurgency
* Train and equip the community members to better communicate and address dispute issues with at-risk youths which will lead to positive change and long-term peace in the communities

'''Aleksandar Stoimenov Stamboliyski''' ({{lang-bg|Александър Стоименов Стамболийски}}, variously transliterated such as Aleksandar/Alexander Stamboliyski/Stamboliiski/Stamboliski; 1 March 1879 &amp;ndash; 14 June 1923) was the [[List of Prime Ministers of Bulgaria|prime minister]] of [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] from 1919 until 1923. Stamboliyski was a member of the [[Bulgarian Agrarian People's Union|Agrarian Union]], an [[Agrarianism|agrarian peasant]] movement which was not allied to the [[List of Bulgarian monarchs|monarchy]], and edited their [[newspaper]]. He opposed the country's participation in [[World War I]] and its support for the [[Central Powers]]. In a famous incident during 1914 Stamboliyski's patriotism was challenged when members of the Bulgarian parliament questioned whether he was Bulgarian or not, to which he shouted in response "At a moment, like the current, when our brothers South Slavs are threatened, I am neither a Bulgarian nor a Serb, I am a South Slav ([[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]])!".&lt;ref&gt;Several different versions of this quote exist, but all contain more or less the same meaning but with slightly different wording, presumably from differing translations, M. D. Stragnakovitch, Oeuvre durapprochement et de l'union des Serbes et des Bulgares dans le passé(Paris: éditions et publications contemporaines Pierre Bossuet, 47,rue de la Gaîté, 1930), 26; Cited from Stavrianos, The BalkanFederation Movement, 39;also see J. Swire, TheBulgarian Conspiracy (London: R. Hale, 1939), 142.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement relates to his belief in a Balkan Federation which would unite the region and supersede many of the national identities which existed at the time. {{fact|date=January 2018}} He was court-martialed and sentenced to life in prison in 1915 due to his opposition to Bulgaria joining the Central Powers in WWI.

In 1918, with the defeat of Bulgaria as an ally of the Central Powers, [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Tsar Ferdinand]] abdicated in favor of his son [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Tsar Boris III]] who released Stamboliyski from prison. He joined the government in January, 1919, and was appointed prime minister on October 14 of that year. On March 20, 1920, the Agrarian Union won national elections and Stamboliyski was confirmed as prime minister.

During his term in office, Stamboliyski made a concerted effort to improve relations with the rest of Europe. This resulted in Bulgaria becoming the first of the defeated states to join the [[League of Nations]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Crampton, The Historical Dictionary of Bulgaria (Oxford, Oxford University Press: 2007), 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Though popular with the peasants, he antagonized the middle class and military. Many considered him to be a virtual dictator or a peasant thug. He was ousted in a military coup in [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1923|June 1923]]. He attempted to raise a rebellion against the new government, but was captured by the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization|IMRO]], who detested him for renouncing Bulgarian claims on the territory of Macedonia, was brutally tortured, and killed.

Born to a [[farmer]], Aleksandar Stamboliyski spent his childhood in his birth village of {{Interlanguage link multi|Slavovitsa|bg|3=Славовица (област Пазарджик)|lt=Slavovitsa}}, the same village where he would later gather several thousand [[insurrection]]ists from the region and advance against the town of [[Pazardzhik]].  However, before this grand counter-insurgence was to transpire, Stamboliyski had to work himself up the ranks of the nation’s political scene as the leader of the [[Bulgarian Agrarian People's Union]].  Although successful in his political ambition of acquiring the highest political office of the state, the unstable political atmosphere of Bulgaria in the early inter-war years ultimately contributed to Stamboliyski’s demise.

==Early political career==

{{Refimprove|date=June 2007}}
Until the mid 20th century Bulgaria was primarily a land of small, independent peasant farmers. The proportion of the population (approximately 4/5) who were peasants was roughly the same in 1920 as it had been in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Crampton, Stamboliski (London: Haus Publishing, 2009), 19.  Between 1880 and 1910 the population of towns in Bulgaria even declined slightly, John R. Lampe, “Unifying the Yugoslav Economy, 1918-1921: Misery and Early Misunderstandings,” in Dimitrije Djordjevic, ed., The Creation of Yugoslavia 1914-1918 (Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-Clio Press, 1980), 147-52.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]], or BANU, emerged in 1899 in reaction to the low standard of living facing the agrarian peasants of Bulgaria as well as the general focus on the towns and cities which marked the political situation at the turn of the twentieth century.  By 1911, as the leader of the BANU, Stamboliyski was a notorious anti-monarchist and led the opposition to Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria. On September 25, 1918, in order to gain the BANU’s acceptance, the regime was forced to release a number of political detainees, most notably Aleksandar Stamboliyski, who had been sentenced to life in prison after his meeting with Tsar Ferdinand to protest the war effort on 18 September 1915; two weeks before Bulgaria entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers. When the regime released Stamboliyski from prison, it did so with the hope that he would contain the growing unrest within the army, which at that time was essentially in full rebellion and heading for Sofia.  While he initially tried to quell the rebellion, his fellow agrarian party activist [[Rayko Daskalov]], who had been sent with Stamboliyski for the same purpose, quickly joined the rebellion and became its de facto leader. Rayko Daskalov issued a declaration under his name and that of Stamboliyski, which named Bulgaria a people's republic and the tyrannical regime of Tsar Ferdinand was denounced and told to surrender to the new provisional government headed on paper by the BANU leader. Even though Stambolyiski had not been informed of Daskalov's decision (his name had been added to the declaration without his knowledge) and he immediately went to Sofia to inform the government that he did not support the uprising, a warrant was issued for his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;''Crown of Thorns: The Reign of King Boris III of Bulgaria, 1918-1943 '', Stephane Groueff, Madison Books, 1998, [https://books.google.bg/books?id=NZcVYDLUMw0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=crown+of+thorns+boris+of+bulgaria&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MP8sVbPKFIO2acjHgLgN&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Daskalov\&amp;f=false pp.38-41]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Radomir Rebellion of 1918==
The rebellion, centered to the west of Sofia in the town of [[Radomir (town)|Radomir]] threatened to develop into a national revolution, but the movement for a new, agrarian republic was quickly eliminated due to several factors and was left without the sufficient means to bring about the change it desired.  Lasting from only 28 September until 2 October, the rebellion although short-lived found some early success. The mutineers managed to enter Bulgaria's capital where tsarist forces, led by general Alexander Protogerov, crushed the rebellion killing an estimated 2000 soldiers and arresting an estimated 3000. Unlike many of his supporters, Stamboliyski was able to escape the fate of imprisonment or execution and, instead, went into hiding until he was to re-surface in the political arena during the reign of Tsar [[Boris III]].  The movement, however, could not be considered a total failure by the Agrarian Union as it was successful in eliminating the rule of Tsar Ferdinand, who fled Bulgaria by train on 3 October 1918, in the wake of Allied occupation. Ferdinand was to be succeeded by his son, Boris III, with the approval of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]].

==Ascension to power==
After Tsar Boris III took the throne, the emerging political factions in Bulgaria were the Agrarians, the Socialists, and the [[Macedonians (Bulgarians)|Macedonian]] extremists. However, due to the loss of the territory of Macedonia immediately following Bulgaria’s surrender to the Allied forces, the Macedonian faction fell out of contention leaving the Agrarian and Communists factions struggling for political supremacy. As the general election of 1919 approached, Stamboliyski came out of hiding and won the election of prime minister of the new coalition cabinet.  However, because the election was so close, Stamboliyski was forced to form a government coalition between the agrarians and the left-wing parliamentary parties.  By March 1920, however, Stamboliyski was able to form a solely BANU government with another decisive election victory and some tactical manipulation of the parliamentary system (common practice at the time).  From his complete acquisition of power in March 1920, until his death on 14 June 1923, Stamboliyski ruled Bulgaria with a strong personality leading many to remember him as a kind of strongman, dictator, or thug. This is in spite of his electoral successes.

==Rule==
[[File:Slavovitsa-PZ-Alexander-Stamboliyski-ossuary-3.jpg|right|thumb|Memorial ossuary of Aleksandar Stamboliyski]]
Stamboliyski’s government immediately faced pressures from the political left and right, a harsh international occupation force, debt amounting to a “preposterous sum”,&lt;ref&gt;Crampton, Stamboliski, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as national problems such as food shortages, general strikes, and a great flu epidemic.  His goal was to transform the political, economic, and social structures of the state while at the same time rejecting the rhetoric of radicalism and its Bolshevik associations.  He aimed at establishing the rule of the peasant, which comprised over 80% of the population of Bulgaria in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Crampton, Bulgaria, 283.&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of his objective was to offer each member of the dominant group an equitable distribution of property and access to the cultural and welfare facilities in all villages. The local BANU cooperative organizations known at the Druzhbi were to play a vital role in linking the peasant economy to the national and international markets in addition to offering the benefits of large scale agriculture without resorting to Soviet style collectivization. Stamboliyski founded the BANU [[Orange Guard]], a peasant militia that both protected him and carried out his agrarian reforms. In foreign policy, Stamboliyski abided by the terms he helped set in [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine|the peace treaty signed at Neuilly-sur-Seine]] in November 1919, which was eventually exploited by the extreme right factions of Bulgaria as he failed to lessen the outstanding reparations payments until 1923.  Stamboliyski rejected territorial expansion and aimed at forming a Balkan federation of agrarian states, a policy which began with a détente with Yugoslavia. His administration was successful in bringing out land redistribution legislation, creating maximum property holding regulations. It also increased the vocational element in education, especially in rural areas.  Being ardently anti-war himself he kept the army below the low level set by the Neuilly treaty, further angering the military by restriction their social status and opportunities for advancement. However, importantly Stamboliyski never settled the Macedonian problem.

On February 2, 1923, Stamboliyski survived an assassination attempt carried out by the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last= Chalk |editor-first= Peter |title= Encyclopedia of Terrorism |date= 2012-11-21 |publisher= [[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn= 9780313385353 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=czK7lIU7m1oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:d_RwdKRuhkgC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIu9Kp-JLOAhVn54MKHcgWB78QuwUIIDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote= ... the attempted killing of Bulgarian prime minister Aleksandar Stamboliiski on February 2, 1923;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The coup d’état of 9 June 1923 and the murder of Stamboliyski==
On March 23, 1923 he signed the [[Treaty of Niš (1923)|Treaty of Niš]] with the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] and undertook the obligation to suppress the operations of the IMRO carried out from Bulgarian territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= World War One|last=Roberts |first=Priscilla Mary |authorlink= |quote=On 23 March 1923 Stamboliyski signed the convention of Nish with the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslavia).

Italian agents sent by Mussolini in retaliation against Stamboliyski's refusal to ally with him against Yugoslavia also aided in the coup.&lt;ref&gt;"From the day Stamboliski turned down Baron Aliotti's offer of a secret military alliance against Yugoslavia, the Italians set out to destroy him.  They had three major weapons - bribery, terror, and Bulgarian reparations."  Kosta Todorov, Balkan firebrand: the autobiography of a rebel, soldier and statesman (Chicago: Ziff-Davis Pub. Co., 1943), 151.&lt;/ref&gt; With the Communist faction refusing to intervene and the international community uninterested, Stamboliyski was isolated.

As important as the overthrow of Stambolyiski was for Bulgaria, the refusal of the Communist Party of Bulgaria to unite with the Stamboliyski's Agrarians had important ideological consequences for the young Soviet Russia next door.  The passivity of the Bulgarian Communists during the June 9th, coup in 1923 was bitterly disappointing to nearly all factions within the Russian government and the Bolshevik Party.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Trotsky, "Lessons of October" contained in ''The Challenge of the Left Opposition: 1923-1925'' (Pathfinder Press: New York, 1975) pp. 200-201.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Stalin]], who, by 1923, was gathering power in the absence of [[Lenin]] in the leadership of the new Soviet Russian government, had sought close relations with the Stamboliyski government.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Fischer, ''Stalin and German Communism'' (Transaction Books: New Brunswick, N.J., 1982) p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;  Firstly, the Soviet government sought a means to break the ring of isolation that the western powers had erected around the new Soviet nation.  Secondly, although the Bulgarian proletariat was growing, it was still a very small part of the Bulgarian economy.  Accordingly, following the Russian example, Russian Communists were strongly of the opinion that the Communists in Bulgaria should aid and support the liberal petty bourgeoisie—in the form of Stamboliyski's Agrarian Party as a means to advance the interests of the workers in Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Crampton, ''Bulgaria'' (Oxford University Press: Oxford, 2007) p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, this was the thinking of the Fourth Congress of the Communist International which was held in Moscow in  November, 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Fischer, Stalin, and German Communism'', p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the Fourth Congress, delegates instructed the Bulgarians to support the Stamboliyski government.  Yet in the right wing coup of [[Alexander Tsankov]] in June, 1923, the Bulgarian Communist Party refused to come to the aid of Stamboliyski and following the coup the Communist Party was forced "underground" by the Tsankovist Terror that followed the coup.&lt;ref&gt;See note 22 in ''The Challenge of the Left Opposition: 1923-1925'', p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Communist International then "ordered" the Bulgarian Communist Party to redress this error of passivity in the face of a reactionary coup.  Accordingly, the Bulgarian Communist Party denied that they had suffered a defeat in the June coup and rose in a hastily arranged uprising in September 1923.  This uprising however was quickly defeated by the Tsankov government.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Compton, ''Bulgaria'', p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, ended the third and last real attempt by the Soviet Russian government to initiate a revolution in Europe.  It had long been an article of faith among the Bolshevik leaders of Soviet Russia that the Russian Revolution needed an accompanying revolution among the more industrialized nations of Europe to prevent the capitalist nations from gathering together and eventually crushing Soviet Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Trotsky, "Results and Prospects" contained in ''The Permanent Revolution'' (Pathfinder Press: New York, 1976)pp. 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the defeat in Bulgaria following the defeat of the Red Army in front of Warsaw in August 1920 which prevented a workers government in Poland from being established and more importantly a failure of the March 1921 uprising in Germany convinced the Bolshevik leaders that revolution in Europe was not going to happen any time soon.

In the June, 1923, coup, Stamboliyski was taken prisoner in his native village of Slavovitsa, where he was relocated following the coup d’état.  From his native village, Stamboliyski was organizing a counter-insurgence that was large in number but weak in arms.  He was brutally tortured and murdered by the IMRO. The IMRO members were extremely brutal in assassinating him because of his signature on the Treaty of Niš.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lampe |first=John R. |author= |authorlink=John R.

==The town of Stamboliyski==

In 1979 the then Communist government of Bulgaria renamed the town previously known as ''Novi Krichim'' to "[[Stamboliyski]]", in honour of Aleksandar Stamboliyski.

'''Amy Bailey''' '''[[Order of Jamaica|OJ]]''', '''[[Order of Distinction|OD]]''', '''[[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]''', '''MBE''' (27 November 1895 – 3 October 1990) was a [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] educator, social worker and women's rights advocate. She was a co-founder of the Jamaican aid organization Save the Children and was the driving force behind the drive for introducing birth control to the island. She received many honours and awards in her career, including the [[Order of the British Empire]], the Jamaican [[Order of Distinction]] and the Marcus Garvey Award for Excellence in 1988. In 1990, shortly before her death, she was honoured with the [[Order of Jamaica]].

==Early life==
Amy Beckford Bailey was born on 27 November 1895{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}} in Walderston, [[Manchester Parish]], [[Jamaica]],{{sfn|Rose|3/1978}} to Anne (née Lawson) and William Frederick Bailey.{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}} Bailey was the fifth of eight children born{{sfn|Grinam|8 February 1990|p=16}} to her parents who were both teachers.{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}} Her father was the founder of the Jamaica Union of Teachers and encouraged all of his children to become teachers, as there were few other opportunities open to black Jamaicans.{{sfn|Rose|3/1978}}{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}} After attending elementary school at Mount Olivet Primary School, Bailey studied at Shortwood Teacher’s College,{{sfn|Rose|3/1978}} graduating in 1917.{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}} Soon thereafter, she was stricken with severe [[dysmenorrhea]]. While recuperating, she studied on her own to earn accounting, bookkeeping,{{sfn|Grinam|8 February 1990|p=16}} and shorthand.{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}}

==Career==
In January 1920, Bailey began teaching at the Kingston Technical High School (KTHS),{{sfn|Grinam|8 February 1990|p=16}} when she was hired to replace her sister who was taking a three-month leave of absence. Ivy didn't return to the school, and Bailey, who began as a shorthand instructor, remained until 1958.{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}} After she retired from KTHS, Bailey taught at the College of Arts Science and Technology between 1958 and 1963.{{sfn|Rose|8/1978}}

==Public social work==
In 1936,{{sfn|Altink|2011|p=517}} Bailey and her sister Ina founded the Women’s Liberal Club (WLC), with the goal of helping women improve their employment opportunities, as rarely were women promoted for their qualifications, but instead by having to curry favour from prominent men.{{sfn|Rose|8/1978}} They believed that by improving the socio-economic status of women, they would improve their cultural and national pride. In 1939 WLC organized a conference to allow women to discuss the problems they faced. Issues they highlighted were that women were barred from participation in the Legislative Council; could not be appointed as officials, such as inspectors, jurors, justices of the peace, or police officers; were barred from upper positions in civil service jobs;{{sfn|Altink|2011|p=517}} and that racial discrimination impacted their employment opportunity.{{sfn|Altink|2011|p=520}} Bailey formalized these issues into recommendations, which were submitted to the governor in 1941 and led to a law prohibiting sex discrimination. The law allowed women to hold public office and eliminated employment bans for women.{{sfn|Altink|2011|p=517}}

Concerned with the discrimination she saw in the class hierarchy enshrined in Jamaica at the time, Bailey wrote a series of editorials that were published in ''[[Gleaner Company|The Gleaner]]''. She openly addressed the racial discrimination that relegated black-skinned Jamaicans to menial jobs and poverty, brown-skinned Jamaicans to middle-class blue-collar jobs and white Jamaicans to positions of authority. In one article written in 1937, entitled "Not Wanted—I", she discussed how it was especially difficult for women to attain positions in line with their skills and training. A few months later, she published "Discrimination", in which she urged women to boycott institutions and establishments that did not treat them fairly. These articles drew criticism from some factions of society, which claimed Bailey was trying to start a [[Ethnic conflict|race war]]. Bailey countered that she was simply trying to bring the issue into the open and prompt laws to address disparity.{{sfn|Altink|2011|p=519}} Though the WLC conference had proposed a law end to racial discrimination be passed, that was one of the recommendations upon which the government refused to act.{{sfn|Altink|2011|p=520}}

Bailey and [[May Farquharson]] joined forces in 1937 and began working on other strategies to improve the lives of women. One of the issues they discussed was family planning, and another was an initiative called Save the Children Fund, which they founded in 1938. Joining forces with them were [[Mary Morris Knibb]], Dr. Jai Lal Varma, and Dr. Pengelley. With seed money given by May’s father Arthur Farquharson, Bailey travelled to London with [[Una Marson]]{{sfn|Hemming|1976}}{{sfn|Grinam|8 February 1990|p=16}} to raise funds for providing food, clothing and textbooks to Jamaican school children.{{sfn|Rose|3/1978}} The fund drive was a resounding success and the organization is still thriving.{{sfn|Hemming|1976}} While in England, Bailey became the first Jamaican to testify to the [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)#Royal Commission|Royal Commission]] headed by [[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne]] about labour unrest, the burgeoning trade union movement, as well as the political unrest plaguing Jamaica at that time.{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}} She also met with proponents of family planning, and when she returned to Jamaica a birth control drive was launched{{sfn|Hemming|1976}} in 1939 with a seminar held at the Ward Theater.{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}}

Leading up to the meeting, Dr. Varma, an Indian-born doctor who was residing in Jamaica, and several other prominent figures published their views on the matter in ''The Gleaner''. Varma and Dr. William Edward Mcculloch were the only physicians willing to publish their views in favour of controlling the birth rate. Their view was that the extremely high birth rate in Jamaica was a hindrance to economic progress. The doctor's views were refuted by the churches, which though concerned about illegitimacy, felt that birth control was a family matter.{{sfn|Bourbonnais|2009|p=40}} Bailey, saw the issue as one that addressed gender and racial inequalities. She organized, with the help of Farquharson and Judith Decordova, a charity worker, a three-month lecture tour throughout Jamaica by [[Edith How-Martyn]], a British feminist and birth control advocate.{{sfn|Bourbonnais|2009|p=40}} They established their first clinic in 1939 at 24 East Race Course,{{sfn|Grinam|15 February 1990}} and provided nursery care and parenting classes.{{sfn|Altink|2011|p=517}} The women successfully continued the programme, despite the various organizations that disapproved, until the government finally took over Family Planning.{{sfn|Grinam|15 February 1990}}

Another initiative launched in 1938 occurred when Bailey met with Governor [[Edward Brandis Denham]] to express her concern about the limited opportunities available to black youths. She expressed the frustration of her students who had graduated with technical skills but were barred from working in civil service jobs. Believing that her outspokenness would result in reprimand, she was surprised when a committee was set up{{sfn|Grinam|8 February 1990|p=16}} within two weeks of the governor's visit with her to investigate the situation.{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}} Meeting between 1938 and 1939, the committee recommended that civil service exams be opened to all graduates of the Technical High School. Beginning in 1939, banking and business employment became open to the students.{{sfn|Grinam|8 February 1990|p=16}}

In 1944, the adviser to the Comptroller for Colonial Development and Welfare for the West Indies publicly criticized Jamaican women for their lack of contribution to their nation. Bailey took the words as a call to action and founded the Homecraft Training Centre{{sfn|Davidson|Wynter|1988|p=3}} as a way to build their dignity and self-respect while teaching them skills.{{sfn|''Sunday Gleaner Magazine''|1986|p=3}} In 1946 with her own funds, she made a down-payment on the property at 4 Rosedale Avenue in Kingston and began offering home economics courses.{{sfn|Davidson|Wynter|1988|p=3}} The centre offered training in catering, cooking, domestic skills, and sewing, as well as [[English language]] and arithmetic to girls. She headed the centre until 1978, when she retired.{{sfn|Rose|8/1978}} 

Bailey died on 3 October 1990 at Nuttall Memorial Hospital in Kingston, Jamaica.{{sfn|''Jamaica Record''|10/1990|pp=1a, 9a}}

==Legacy==
Throughout her lifetime, Bailey received many awards and honours. In 1978, she was awarded the Jamaican [[Order of Distinction]] for her public service.{{sfn|Rose|8/1978}} In January 1988, she was awarded the Marcus Garvey Award for Excellence for her dedication to the development of social programs of Jamaica.{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=11}} In 1990, a documentary on the lives of Bailey and Farquharson, their remarkable friendship, and their work for women's political and economic equality was produced by Sistren Research.{{sfn|''The Star''|1990|p=8}} On [[International Women's Day]], 8 March 1990, Bailey and Farquharson, were awarded the [[Order of Jamaica]] for their contributions to women's rights. A ceremony bestowing the order was held on 5 June 1990.{{sfn|''Jamaica Record''|6/1990|p=2}}

The '''Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia''' ('''AISSGA''') is possibly the oldest known [[intersex]] organization, established in 1985.&lt;ref name="nsw" /&gt; It provides peer and family support, information and advocacy. The group is run by volunteers, for people with intersex variations such as [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]].&lt;ref name="site"&gt;{{cite web | title = WELCOME TO THE AISSG AUSTRALIA WEBSITE | url = http://aissga.org.au | publisher = Androgen Insensivitity Syndrome Support Group Australia | access-date = 2016-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nsw" /&gt;

== History ==

The Androgen Insensivitity Syndrome Support Group Australia may be the oldest [[intersex]] organization, established in 1985,&lt;ref name="nsw"&gt;{{Cite web| last1 = Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia| last2 = Briffa| first2 = Anthony| author-link2 = Tony Briffa | title = Discrimination against People affected by Intersex Conditions: Submission to NSW Government| url = http://www.antidiscrimination.justice.nsw.gov.au/Documents/submission%20about%20intersex%20discrimination%20in%20nsw.pdf | date = 22 January 2003 | access-date = 2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; prior to the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group (UK), established in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aissg.org/INDEX.HTM | title = Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group (AISSG)| publisher = Androgen Insensivitity Syndrome Support Group | access-date = 2016-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Intersex Society of North America]] (ISNA) in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dear ISNA Friends and Supporters | url = http://www.isna.org | publisher = [[Intersex Society of North America]] | date = 2008 | access-date= 2016-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AISSGA was founded by Dr Garry Warne, then the Director of Paediatric Endocrinology at the [[Royal Children's Hospital]], Melbourne.&lt;ref name="nsw" /&gt; It is now run by a board of people with intersex variations, and parents. Notable members include [[Bonnie Hart]], [[Phoebe Hart]] and [[Tony Briffa]]. Many members of the group took part in Phoebe Hart's 2010 autobiographical road movie, ''[[Orchids, My Intersex Adventure]]''.

== Activities ==

=== Peer support ===

The core activity of the Group is to provide peer and family support, information and advocacy.&lt;ref name="site" /&gt; It produces regular newsletters, known as dAISy, an annual conference, and regular meetings in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney.&lt;ref name="site" /&gt;

=== Physical integrity and bodily autonomy ===

The group has advocated on [[intersex human rights]] issues since at least the turn of the century, with submissions on discrimination and prenatal terminations dating back to 2003.&lt;ref name="nsw" /&gt; [[Tony Briffa]] was published in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] in April 2004, calling for an end to irreversible sex assignment treatments in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In March 2017, representatives of Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia participated in an Australian and Aotearoa/New Zealand consensus "Darlington Statement" by intersex community organizations and others.&lt;ref name="darlington2017" /&gt; The statement calls for legal reform, including the criminalization of deferrable [[intersex medical interventions]] on children, an end to legal classification of sex, and improved access to peer support.&lt;ref name="darlington2017"&gt;{{Cite| last1 = Androgen Insensitivity Support Syndrome Support Group Australia| author1-link = Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia | last2 = Intersex Trust Aotearoa New Zealand| author2-link = Intersex Trust Aotearoa New Zealand| last3 = Organisation Intersex International Australia| author3-link = Organisation Intersex International Australia | last4 = Black| first4 = Eve| last5 = Bond| first5 = Kylie| last6 = Briffa| first6 = Tony| author6-link = Tony Briffa | last7 = Carpenter| first7 = Morgan| author7-link = Morgan Carpenter | last8 = Cody| first8 = Candice| last9 = David| first9 = Alex| last10 = Driver| first10 = Betsy| last11 = Hannaford| first11 = Carolyn| last12 = Harlow| first12 = Eileen| last13 = Hart| first13 = Bonnie| author13-link = Bonnie Hart | last14 = Hart| first14 = Phoebe| author14-link = Phoebe Hart | last15 = Leckey| first15 = Delia| last16 = Lum| first16 = Steph| last17 = Mitchell| first17 = Mani Bruce| author17-link = Mani Mitchell | last18 = Nyhuis| first18 = Elise| last19 = O'Callaghan| first19 = Bronwyn| last20 = Perrin| first20 = Sandra| last21 = Smith| first21 = Cody| last22 = Williams| first22 = Trace| last23 = Yang| first23 = Imogen| last24 = Yovanovic| first24 = Georgie| title = Darlington Statement| date = March 2017 | url = http://aissga.org.au/darlington_statement.htm | archive-url = https://eprints.qut.edu.au/104412/ | archive-date = 2017-03-21 | accessdate = March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="copland2017ds"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Copland| first = Simon| title = Intersex people have called for action.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:tocqueville.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Alexis de Tocqueville, considered by many to be the father of Associationalism.]]  --&gt;
'''Associationalism''' or '''associative democracy''' is a political movement in which "human welfare and liberty are both best served when as many of the affairs of a society as possible are managed by voluntary and democratically self-governing associations."&lt;ref name="Hirst112"&gt;Smith, M. K.; ''[http://www.infed.org/association/b-assoc.htm Association, la vie associative and lifelong learning]'' cites Hirst, P. [[#References|References]] page 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Associationalism "gives priority to freedom in its scale of values, but it contends that such freedom can only be pursued effectively if individuals join with their fellows"&lt;ref name="Hirst112"/&gt;

==The concept of associationalism==

===Roots===
Associationalism is a European political theory, stemming from 19th  and early 20th century social and political theorists from the continent.  In France, such political thinkers as de Tocqueville, Proudhon, Durkheim, and Duguit. In England, such pluralists as Cole, Figgis, Laski, Barker, and Maitland.   The theory provides an alternative to the previously popular doctrines of state-centered and collectivist ideals which had all but dominated  twentieth-century politics:  Western social democracy and Eastern bloc Marxist–Leninism.&lt;ref&gt;Kaspersen p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alexis de Tocqueville's associationalism===
[[Alexis de Tocqueville]]'s idea of associationalism “...stressed volunteerism, community spirit and independent associational life as protections against the domination of society by the state, and indeed as a counterbalance which helped to keep the state accountable and effective”.&lt;ref name="Lewis p. 3"&gt;Lewis p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  In Tocqueville’s vision then, economic freedom fosters greed, which engenders political apathy, which results in excessive individualism and passive reliance on the state.  This political apathy will in turn result in the almost inevitable growth of government if left unchecked by associationalism. Thus, Tocqueville predicted that “It is easy to see the time coming in which men will be less and less able to produce, by each alone, the commonest bare necessities of life. The tasks of government must therefore perpetually increase, and its efforts to cope with them must spread its net ever wider. The more government takes the place of associations, the more will individuals lose the idea of forming associations and need the government to come to their help. That is a vicious cycle of cause and effect”.&lt;ref&gt;de Tocqueville p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expanded definition===
Associational democracy is, in essence, both a political structure and system of relations with the goal of easing pluralist social negotiation and priorities.&lt;ref&gt;Kaspersen p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  It became an important aspect of public policy, countering previous laissez-faire traditions.  Critics considered laissez-faire, which essentially equated to liberal individualism, as not conducive to the fostering of upward mobility in society.  Associationalism, as opposed to liberal individualism, embodies a deliberate commitment to social cooperation as well as public well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Martell p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
	
"Association....grew out of a sense of difference; for the middle class, it meant crossing class lines to bring together people of diverse identities and conditions".&lt;ref&gt;McGerr p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  According to David Lewis, during the late 19th and early 20th century the new middle class required “...sanctioned private accumulation underwritten by a state which maintained legal order and stability"·&lt;ref name="Lewis p. 3"/&gt;  As a result, the state needed to become powerful enough to maintain order, but not so strong as to become oppressive; neither laissez-faire nor statist.  Finding this balance between transgressing autonomy and dangerous accumulation of power could prove difficult, and associationalism appeared to be a possible solution.&lt;ref&gt;Kaspersen p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Associationalism brought together several political ideologies which, until its conception, were frequently at odds: pluralism, socialism, and cooperative mutualism.  It provides for a pluralist rather than a statist or constraining collectivist socialism, yet it also provides for a mutualist and cooperative pluralism.  This, as opposed to pluralism which reacts so far to statist [[communitarianism]] that it slides into an unrestricted competitive asociality.&lt;ref&gt;Martell P. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Beginnings of American associationalism==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:roosevelt.jpg|275px|thumb|left|A poster for the election of 1900. ]]  --&gt;

===Setting the stage===
Urban politics in late 19th century America proved an ideal situation for the emergence of associationalism, ripe with several qualifications discussed by early associationalists.  In addition, voter turnout was relatively high, though usually confined to party lines.  Despite this fact, the two large national parties at the time (Democrats and Republicans) lacked significant ideological differences on specific issues.  Respected members of communities across the country began to propose associationalism as a solution to America's social political problems. Several Protestant ministers such as Lyman Abbot, Washington Gladden, Josiah Strong, and Walter Raushenbusch began to call for a “social gospel.”  “The next great principle,” Rauschenbusch proclaimed in 1896, “is association”.&lt;ref&gt;McGerr p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;  These growing political currents in favor of associationalism perhaps culminated when voters elected William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, a left statist associationalist who would become president shortly thereafter, in 1900.

===Protective legislation===
“Associationalism is fundamentally about collective governance – about the legal constitution of groups and bodies politic and the rules and bylaws that regulate the interrelationships of members”.&lt;ref&gt;Novak p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  During the early 20th century Congress passed a great deal of “protective legislation,” which was, in essence, legislated associationalism.  Labor received improved work conditions resulting in fewer work-related injuries. Wages were increased while hours were decreased.  In addition, probably the most important protective legislation pertained to the legal establishment and organization of large labor unions.

On the other side of the coin, employer costs went up resulting in outsourcing and decreased cash flow into such areas as research and development, slowing technological progress.  Fewer hours and the fact that labor was more organized (allowing for an increase in strikes and protests) resulted in less production.  Finally, such strong government influence over labor could lead to an abuse of power, favoring certain unions.  The results of these legislated regulations suggested to critics that associationalism tends to benefit labor (the "people”) directly at the cost of both corporate management and technological progress.

==Early presidential associationalism==

===Theodore Roosevelt===
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:photo59.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Members of the United Mine Workers Union striking in 1902.]] --&gt;
	[[Theodore Roosevelt]] (President 1901-1908) was the first true champion of American associationalism as evidenced by his intervention into the United Mine Workers strike of 1902.  For the first time representatives from government, labor, and management met collectively and were able to resolve the conflict.  When management was uncooperative, Roosevelt threatened to employ the military on behalf of labor to arrive at a resolution.

Instead, a five-member commission was established to communicate with the company management.  Also, wages were increased by ten percent and the length of the work day was cut from ten hours to nine, keeping union membership sound.  By demonstrating a new role for the state in such conflicts (aside from the previously held military positions) associationalism took root in American society and politics, and there wasn't another major coal strike in the country until the 1920s.

===Woodrow Wilson===
[[Woodrow Wilson]] (President 1913-1920), a regulatory liberal, employed associationalism during World War I to control and regulate capital, ensuring a steady flow of war supplies while minimizing the risk of breaks in manufacturing vital to the war effort.  The establishment of such government agencies as the [[National War Labor Board (1918–1919)|National War Labor Board]] were instrumental in preventing strikes and ensuring collective bargaining.  In addition, Wilson appointed the country's first Secretary of Labor that was pro labor ([[William B. Wilson]]).  The policies were implemented as America successfully met its goals in wartime production.  There were nearly no strikes, many companies saw enormous profits, and the Allies won the war.

more compact definitions. The conjunction of two classes contains the languages that are the intersection of a language of the first class and a language of the second class. Disjunction is defined in a similar way with the union in place of the intersection.
* C &amp;and; D = { A &amp;cap; B | A &amp;isin; C &amp;nbsp; B &amp;isin; D }
* C &amp;or;  D = { A &amp;cup; B | A &amp;isin; C &amp;nbsp; B &amp;isin; D }

According to this definition, DP = NP &amp;and; coNP. The other classes of the Boolean hierarchy can be defined as follows.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{BH}_{2k} = \mathsf{coNP} \wedge \mathsf{BH}_{2k-1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{BH}_{2k+1} = \mathsf{NP} \vee \mathsf{BH}_{2k}&lt;/math&gt;

The following equalities can be used as alternative definitions of the classes of the Boolean hierarchy:&lt;ref name=Wagner87&gt;{{cite journal
| title = More Complicated Questions About Maxima and Minima, and Some Closures of NP
| author = Wagner, K.
| doi = 10.1016/0304-3975(87)90049-1
| journal = [[Theoret. Comput. Sci.]]
| year = 1987
| volume = 51
| pages = 53–80
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{BH}_{2k} = \bigvee_{i=1}^k \mathsf{DP}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{BH}_{2k+1} = \mathsf{NP} \vee \bigvee_{i=1}^k \mathsf{DP}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively,&lt;ref name=RiegeRothe06&gt;{{cite journal
| title = Completeness in the Boolean Hierarchy: Exact-Four-Colorability, Minimal Graph Uncolorability, and Exact Domatic Number Problems - a Survey
| author = Riege, T.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; for every ''k'' &amp;ge; 3:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{BH}_k = \mathsf{DP} \vee \mathsf{BH}_{k-2}&lt;/math&gt;

== Hardness ==

Hardness for classes of the Boolean hierarchy can be proved by showing a reduction from a number of instances of an arbitrary [[NP-complete]] problem A. In particular, given a sequence {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...  ''x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''} of instances of A such that ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' &amp;isin; A implies ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''-1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; A, a reduction is required that produces an instance ''y'' such that ''y'' &amp;isin; B if and only if the number of ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' &amp;isin; A is odd or even:&lt;ref name=Wagner87 /&gt;

* BH&lt;sub&gt;2''k''&lt;/sub&gt;-hardness is proved if {{tmath|1=m=2k}} and the number of ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' &amp;isin; A is odd
* BH&lt;sub&gt;2''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;-hardness is proved if {{tmath|1=m=2k+1}} and the number of ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' &amp;isin; A is even

Such reductions work for every fixed {{mvar|k}}. If such reductions exist for arbitrary {{mvar|k}}, the problem is hard for P&lt;sup&gt;NP[''O''(log ''n'')]&lt;/sup&gt;.

Bush]]''' (1989–1993), the United States largely followed the precedents set by the [[Cannabis policy of the Ronald Reagan administration|cannabis policy of the Reagan administration]], including prosecution of the [[War on Drugs]].&lt;ref name="PalmiottoUnnithan2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael J.

==Appointment of William Bennett==
In 1989, Bush appointed [[William Bennett]] director of the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]]. Bennet once stated: "why in God's name foster the use of a drug that makes you stupid?"&lt;ref name="CaulkinsKilmer2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jonathan P.

==Operation Green Merchant==
In 1989, the Bush administration began [[Operation Green Merchant]], a nationwide investigation and operation targeting businesses advertising specialized horticultural equipment that was supposedly used to grow cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/27/us/119-seized-in-drive-to-halt-indoor-marijuana-growing.html 119 Seized in Drive to Halt Indoor Marijuana Growing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/4557.html Operation Green Merchant The DEA does a nationwide takedown&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-06-12/features/9406120318_1_high-times-magazine-marijuana&lt;/ref&gt; The program also traced lists of customers who had bought such materials, and raided their homes.&lt;ref name="Holland2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julie Holland|title=The Pot Book: A Complete Guide to Cannabis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tV0oDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT15|date=23 September 2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-59477-898-8|pages=15–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smoke a Joint, Lose Your License==
In 1990, the Bush administration began a program which called for states to further punish drug offenses, including cannabis use, with a six month driver's license suspension, and threatened to withhold federal highway funds from states that did not comply by 1995. Since the law did not require that the drug offense be at all related to driving, it was nicknamed "Smoke a Joint, Lose Your License."&lt;ref name="Boire1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Boire|title=Marijuana Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BeciBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34|date=2 October 1996|publisher=Ronin Pub.|isbn=978-0-914171-86-7|pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compassionate Investigational New Drug program==
In 1978, the Carter Administration founded the [[Compassionate Investigational New Drug program]] to provide federally-produced cannabis grown by the [[University of Mississippi]] to a limited number of patients. In the 1980s, the list of approved recipients was expanded to include persons suffering from [[AIDS]]. The Bush administration closed the program to new applicants in 1992, possibly as a response to an increasing number of applicants suffering from AIDS who used cannabis to improve their appetites to counter wasting, and also in response to findings that cannabis was not medically effective.&lt;ref name="Steve2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elliott Steve|title=The Little Black Book of Marijuana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V9FE6RvH4pEC&amp;pg=PA70|date=26 June 2011|publisher=Peter Pauper Press, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4413-0726-2|pages=70–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barcott2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Barcott|title=Weed the People: The Future of Legal Marijuana in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tTQrBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT350|date=7 April 2015|publisher=Time Home Entertainment|isbn=978-1-61893-607-3|pages=350–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director of Compassion IND, [[James O.

Initial funding was provided by Rabbi Pesach Lerner, Executive Vice President of the [[National Council of Young Israel]].  It has been endorsed by hundreds of Jewish leaders in the [[Diaspora]] and [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/12131 The Forward, An Unsightly Challenge to Israeli Sovereignty, The Hour, By Leonard Fein, Wed. Nov 28, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In preparation for the [[Annapolis Conference|Annapolis Peace summit]] with [[Palestinian Authority]] President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] and United States Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]], ministers of Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]]’s government put forth their view that Jerusalem was negotiable and opened the door to concessions of parts of Jerusalem, including the [[Temple Mount]], which is considered by many to be Judaism’s holiest site.  Following his ministers’ remarks, Olmert himself questioned the value of maintaining Jewish sovereignty over certain Jerusalem neighborhoods. As a result, many Jewish leaders around the world who held to a policy of not publicly challenging decisions of Israel's government, have chosen to coalesce around the position: opposing Israeli negotiations which include any discussion of ceding sovereignty over part or all of Jerusalem.

Through his reading of the significance of negotiating on Jerusalem, Rabbi Lerner asked Jeffrey Ballabon, a nationally experienced strategist with expertise in issue campaigns, crisis management and government relations to recommend and execute a broad-based international strategy to ensure continued Israeli sovereignty over all of Jerusalem.  As a first step, the two called for the creation of a body to coordinate and leverage efforts in Israel and the Diaspora to secure Jewish interests in Jerusalem’s future.

The formation of the Coordinating Council for Jerusalem marks the first time since the establishment of the State of Israel that a significant group of American Jewish organizations have created a broad united front to pursue a policy directly involving Israel that is based on an explicit principle that supersedes deference to the sitting Israeli government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/12144/ The Forward, Diaspora Groups and Israel Spar at Summit, By Marc Perelman, Wed. Nov 28, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  Notably, many of the organizations on the Coordinating Council are among the State of Israel’s most loyal and active supporters.

Within hours of the announcement of their intent to create the Coordinating Council, Lerner and Ballabon were contacted by many groups, within the U.S. and Israel, which also had decided to coordinate their efforts against any Jerusalem negotiations.

In coordination with CCJ's efforts, a majority of the Israeli Knesset signed on to a letter declaring that they would not support any division of Jerusalem.  Subsequently, the Knesset passed a law requiring a two-thirds supermajority of Knesset in order to make any changes to the borders or status of Jerusalem.

CCJ also announced from the outset that it would be working closely and coordinating efforts with major Christian Zionist organizations and leaders.

CCJ and CCJ member organizations have held meetings to put forward their position with U.S. national leaders, including former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former President [[George W. Bush]]'s [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Adviser]] [[Stephen Hadley]] and former Deputy National Security Advisor Elliott Abrams, to inform them of the opposition to any negotiations that would cede any part of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/105534.html |title='''Jewish Telegraphic Agency''' ''Hadley meets with peace skeptics'', 26 November 2007 |access-date=12 December 2007 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070621171021/http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/105534.html |archive-date=21 June 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtontimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071126/FOREIGN02/111260060/1008&amp;template=printart The Washington Times, Not an inch, by James Morrison, Nov 26, 2007]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Olmert has stated that American Jews and Jewish groups have no right or place to interfere with Israel's government matters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/124387 '''Arutz Sheva''', ''Olmert to World Jewry: Israel Makes Sole Decision on Jerusalem'', by Hana Levi Julian, 11/27/07]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imemc.org/article/51745 International Middle East Media Center, Israeli Prime Minister challenges right of US Jews to speak on behalf of Israel, November 27, 2007, by Saed Bannoura]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coordinating Council on Jerusalem includes [[Americans for a Safe Israel]], [[Association for Jewish Outreach Programs]], Emunah of America, [[Hineni]], Jerusalem Reclamation Project, [[National Conference of Synagogue Youth]], [[National Council of Young Israel]], [[One Israel|One Israel Fund]], [[Agudath Israel of America|Poalei Agudath Israel of America]], Rabbinic Alliance to Save Jerusalem, [[Abraham Hecht|Rabbinical Alliance of America]], [[Rabbinical Council of America]], [[Religious Zionists of America]], Russian Jewish Community Foundation, [[Orthodox Union|Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations (OU)]], Unity Coalition for Israel, [[National Council of Young Israel#Young Israel Council of Rabbis|Young Israel Council of Rabbis]], and [[Zionist Organization of America]].

In January 2008, Coordinating Council on Jerusalem publicly announced a strategic alliance with [[Natan Sharansky]]'s [[One Jerusalem]].

===Opposition to CCJ===
While there is a steady group of supporters for the CCJ and its position, groups affiliated with the traditional Jewish left have stated opposition to CCJ and support for Olmert's position.  Olmert himself was critical of CCJ and publicly denounced the involvement of Diaspora Jews within a few days of the announcement of the formation of CCJ.&lt;ref name="NJ _Olmert"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kosterlitz|first=Julie|title=Pushing Israel From Both Sides|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/pushing-israel-from-both-sides-20080410?print=true|accessdate=5 April 2011|newspaper=National Journal|date=April 10, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324051626/http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/pushing-israel-from-both-sides-20080410?print=true|archive-date=24 March 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He subsequently backtracked on that position.&lt;ref name=Olmert_Diaspora&gt;{{cite news|last=Weiss|first=Anthony|title=Olmert Calls for New Israel - Diaspora Ties|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/13664/|accessdate=5 April 2011|newspaper=The Forward|date=June 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26008">A '''debate chamber''' is a room for people to discuss and [[debate]]. Debate chambers are used in governmental and educational bodies, such as a [[parliament]], [[congress]], [[city council]], or a [[university]], either for formal proceedings or for informal discourse, such as a [[deliberative assembly]]. When used for legislative purposes, a debate chamber may also be known as a '''council chamber''', '''legislative chamber''', or similar term.  Some countries, such as New Zealand, use the term '''debating chamber''' as a formal name for the room that houses the national legislature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/features/00NZPHomeNews201202211/guide-to-the-debating-chamber Guide to the debating chamber]. New Zealand Parliament.  Retrieved 2016-04-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debating==
[[File:HUJI Election Debate (8361985738).jpg|thumb]]
Debating can happen almost anywhere.  Whether informal or structured as a discourse between select individuals or small groups with an audience, debates often occur with an audience.  The debate does not ''directly'' involve the audience as they are not participants - they may even be remote, watching on television.  The ''debating chamber'' is where the debate participants engage: the stage, panel or council table, or the presentation station.  The audience is separate, even if the lines between participants and audience are not always distinct.  The positioning of the debating participants is normally oppositional (to each other) or side-by-side in a fan-shape with the focus being the moderator's table (or  audience).  If there is an audience present, the moderator is normally positioned to the side or with their back to the audience (or cameras).  For this style of debate there are more than 2 and rarely more than approximately 15 participants.  More than this typically involves a formally debating body or organization, such as a legislative body, which usually meets in a designated place or chamber, often purpose-built for this function.

==Psychology and geometry==
The configuration of seating affects [[interpersonal communication]] on conscious and subconscious levels. For example, negotiations over the shape of a negotiation table delayed the Vietnam War peace talks for almost a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/cpf/docs/contract_pricing_finance_guide/vol5_ch5.pdf ''Contract Pricing Finance Guide'', Chapter 5, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics].  Retrieved 2016-04-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpersonal communication involves both visual and aural senses.  Our eyes and ears (our receptors) need to face our focus of interest.  Our faces are important senders of both visual and information (e.g. expressions and voice). We confront and communication directly through [[Face-to-face interaction|"face to face" interaction]] with our facial sensors and projector "tools" aimed at our communication partner, whether friend or foe.  The geometry of position can support or influence a position of opposition/confrontation, hierarchy/dominance, or collaboration/equality.  Position can be locational or attitudinal, both, and be supportive or a determining factor of the other. The more direct this is, the more potentially oppositional the position. The less direct, the more "shoulder to shoulder" the position. A two-person (or two-group) meeting can be face-to-face (participants are 180 degrees apart, in opposition), side-by-side (participants are 0 degrees apart, in partnership), or between the two (participants are, for example, 90 degrees apart, in collaboration).  Geometry dictates that a circular gathering with three participants provides the only non-oppositional configuration of more than two persons that allows equal sightlines (all 120 degrees apart).  The more participants, the greater disparity of sightlines between those sitting immediately adjacent and those more directly across, whose position in turn becomes more oppositional.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z3dwTya32nUC&amp;pg=PT64&amp;lpg=PT64&amp;dq=how+does+the+shape+of+seating+affect+negotiation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tuhEmMZLwy&amp;sig=-lK_dnFw0Cu2EECUZDJM9prJmaQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi89IOav5PMAhUEymMKHaLUAi4Q6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=how%20does%20the%20shape%20of%20seating%20affect%20negotiation&amp;f=false Geof Cox, ''FT Essential Guide to Negotiations ePub eBook: How to acheive &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; win: win outcomes'', Chapter 6.  Pearson UK, 2013.] {{ISBN|0273772236}}.  Retrieved 2016-04-11&lt;/ref&gt;

This can be observed in debate chambers, meeting rooms, and at dining room or restaurant tables.  With a long rectangular table, those seated at the "head" or "end" of the tables are in a position of dominance;  they can see everybody, normally everybody can see them, but the others are restricted in seeing only those across from them. Circular, square, or elliptical shaped tables allow for more equal status and equality of line of sight.  The smaller the group and setting, the more equality of participants and sight lines.  [[Winston Churchill]] recognized this when as prime minister he insisted the British House of Commons be rebuilt (after wartime bombing) in a similar size and configuration to maintain the intimate form of debate and its adversarial which he believed was responsible for the creating the British form of government, the two-party, government-opposition system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/architecture/palacestructure/churchill/ Churchill and the Commons Chamber - UK Parliament webpage].

==History==
Whether outdoors or in an enclosed space or chamber, such as a cave, it is likely that the earliest designated places for group discourse or debate occurred around a fire, for light, heat, or protection from predators.  Throughout recorded history there have been a variety of places and spaces designated for similar purposes.  An early gathering for assembly purposes was the [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia of ancient Athens]], a popular assembly open to all male citizens with two years of military service.  This was held in an [[Ekklesiasterion]], which varied from small amphitheaters to a variety of buildings, including ones that could accommodate over 5,000 people. These assemblies were also held in amphitheater-like, open air [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theaters]]. [[Bouleuterion]]s, also translated as council house, assembly house, and senate house, was a building in ancient Greece which housed the [[Boule (ancient Greece)|council of citizens]] of a democratic [[polis|city state]].  In [[Ancient Rome]], the earliest recorded debating chamber was for the deliberative body of the [[Roman Senate]].

The first official debating model that emerged (centuries later) after the fall of the Roman Empire was the [[Magnum Concilium]], or Great Council, after the [[Norman Conquest]] of England in 1066.  These were convened at certain times of the year when church leaders and wealthy landowners were invited to discuss the affairs of the country with the king (of England, Normandy, and France). In the 13th century this developed into the [[Parliament of England]] (concilium regis in parliamento).  Similar models emerged at roughly the same time with the [[Parliament of Scotland]] and [[Parliament of Ireland]].  These were later consolidated into the [[Parliament of Britain]] and the current [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (or British Parliament).  The system of government that emerged in this model is known as the [[Westminster system]].  In Europe, similar models to parliament emerged, termed [[Diet (assembly)|''Diet'']] and [[Thing (assembly)|Thing, or Ting]], ''thing'' derived from old Norse for "appointed time" or "assembly".  The ''parliament'' that claims to have the longest continuous existence is the [[Tynwald]] of the [[Isle of Man]].  In 19th century Russia, the [[Duma]] emerged to perform similar advisory functions to the monarch.

In the 14th century, the king of France established the [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]], a legislative and consultative assembly of the different classes (or ''estates'') of French [[Commoner|subjects]].  In the 18th Century French Revolution, this was transformed into the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] (1789), the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] (1789-1791), the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] (1971-1792), the [[National Convention]] (1792-1795), the [[Council of Five Hundred]] (1795-1799), and eventually the [[tricameral]] (three-house) [[French Consulate]] during the reign of [[Napolean Bonaparte]].  These bodies met in a variety of palaces, a [[Salle du Manège|riding academy]], a [[Théâtre des Tuileries|large theater]], and a [[Tennis Court Oath|tennis court]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Assembly-historical-French-parliament Encyclopædia Britannica, National Assembly - Historical French parliament].

In the late 18th century the [[United States of America]] established the  [[U.S. Congress]], a [[bicameral]] legislative model that would form the template of many newly emergent republics around the world.  The form adopted involved two legislative bodies, each with its own chamber.  The [[lower house]], the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], was intended to provide representation based on population.  The [[upper house]], the [[U.S. Senate]], was intended to provide more deliberative oversight on legislation and was to represent the States (equally).  Each was created and its chambers designed before political parties were well established.

==Names==
The names given to debating places or spaces may refer to an activity, such as assembly or debating; it may refer to the persons performing that activity, such as ''noblemen'' (''Oireachtas'' in Ireland), lords, or [[estates of the realm|estates]]; or it may refer to both, such as Senate (derived from the Latin for ''elder'', and ''assembly'').  Some examples of the more common names for debating spaces:

* '''[[Deliberative assembly|Assembly]]''', also [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] in Irish, as in [[National Assembly]] 
* '''Chamber''' or '''House''', as in [[U.S. House of Representatives]] or [[Chamber of Deputies]].
* '''Council''', as in [[Magnum Concilium]], or [[Federal Council (disambiguation)|Federal Council]].
* '''[[Diet (assembly)|Diet]]''' derived from [[Medieval Latin]] ''dieta'', meaning ''assembly''. Used in reference to many historical European assemblies, such as the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Diet of Worms]], or the [[Hungarian Diet]]. The term is also used in reference to the modern-day Japanese [[Japanese Diet|parliament]]. Cognate terms include the German ''Tag'' (''[[Bundestag]], [[Landtag]]'') and ''Dag'' in various Scandinavian languages (''[[Riksdag]], [[Rigsdagen]]).
* '''[[Duma]]''':  Russian, meaning "consider".
* '''[[Parliament]]''':  derived from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] ''parler'', meaning ''speak.'' 
* '''[[Rada]]''':  Derived from [[Old East Slavic]] ''Рада'', meaning ''council'' (ex. ''[[Verkhovna Rada]]'' in Ukraine, meaning ''Supreme Council'')
* '''[[Thing (assembly)|Thing]]''' derived from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''þingą'' meaning "appointed time", later "meeting" or "assembly". A thing was historically the governing assembly of a [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] society, made up of the free people of the community presided over by [[lawspeaker]]s. Modern day coggnates include [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: ''[[Althing|þing]]'', [[German language|German]] or [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''ding'', and ''[[folketing|ting]]'' in  modern [[Scandinavian languages]]. In English, the word "thing" has not kept its original meaning of "assembly", although it retains that sense in derived terms such as "[[husting]]", and the name of the [[Isle of Man|Manx]] parliament, the [[Tynwald]].
* '''[[Senate]]''':  used in many countries since the time of Ancient Rome, where the Senate ([[Latin]] ''[[Roman Senate|senatus]]'') was an assembly of elders (the term derives from ''[[senex]]'', meaning "old man").

==Seating configuration==
There are several common configurations of seating used in debate chambers:  auditorium, rectangular, fan-shaped, circular, and hybrids.  The shapes of the room vary and do not necessarily reflect or match the seat configurations.  The architectural design of the chamber can shape the style of debating: a semicircular design may promote discussion for the purpose of reaching a consensus, while an arrangement with two opposing sides may promote adversarial debating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Could we fix democracy if we moved the seats around?|url=http://tomorrow.is/news/the-shape-of-debate-to-come/#.WVooE6VtnIU|publisher=Tomorrow|accessdate=2017-07-03|date=2012-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auditorium===
The [[auditorium]] form of seating (and chamber) is a large audience facing a stage, often with a [[proscenium]].  The model is similar to [[direct instruction]] whereby the communication is unidirectional without active interaction or debate.  Response is limited to applause or speakers coming onto the stage, from the audience or backstage, to provide a subsequent presentation to the audience. Given the scale and format, there is little opportunity for any direct discourse.

|File:GreatHall_auditorium.jpg|China's [[Great Hall of the People]]
}}

===Council and court===
The [[council]] and [[courtroom]] configuration of seating is one that fosters interaction between the "[[:wikt:panel|panel]]" (court, council, board, or other officials) and the public.  The panel members may debate or engage in discourse amongst themselves, particularly in a council of elected officials, but that is not normally the main portion of discourse.  The more linear the seating arrangement is, the less supportive of it is for discourse.  City Council chamber are less likely to use a linear configuration whereas [[judge]]s in a [[court of law]] (where there is more than one judge in a sitting) frequently sit in a straight or nearly straight line.

}}

===Rectangular===
The rectangular ([[:wikt:bifurcation|bifurcated]]) seating configuration comprises two opposing rows of seats or benches facing towards a central aisle which bisects the room.  At one end is commonly found a chair, throne, or podium for a [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]], a monarch or president, or chairperson, respectively.  This format is used in the [[Westminster style]] of parliamentary debating chambers, such as in the Parliaments of the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other former British colonies.  In this configuration, on one side of the aisle is the government and the other the opposition.  This supports oppositional or divided groupings, from which emerged in the 19th century the two-party political system in the UK, and its [[British dominions|dominions]] and colonies. Each person speaking is nominally directing his or her comments towards the speaker, but they do so facing the opposing members with their own group facing the same way they are.  Without having one's own side turn around, it is not possible to face all members of the chamber simultaneously.  In the British Parliament, the traditional method of recorded voting is called "[[division of the assembly]]" is by members placing themselves in separate rooms called ''division lobbies'', one each for the "Ayes" and "Noes". (This is derived from the [[Roman Senate]] which voted by division, by a senator seating himself on one side of the chamber or the other to indicate a vote.

Common folklore speaks of the aisle between the government and the opposition sides as being "two sword lengths", or "two sword lengths plus an inch", apart, although there is no record of this being a criterion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/HoC-Chamber.pdf UK House of Commons chamber, UK Parliament].

===Hybrid===
A hybrid of the bifurcated and semi-circular seating configurations combines a central aisle with a curved end at one end facing the focal point (e.g. [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker's chair]]) at the other.
Another hybrid form is one that is rectangular, but not bi-furcated; the overall arrangement is rectangular, as is each of the three seat groupings.  For example, in both the lower house of the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Czech Republic's Chamber of Deputies]] and in the Palace of Assembly at [[Chandigarh, India]], the seating arrangement is a series of straight rows all facing inward in three groupings, two on either side of a central aisle and one at the end facing the podium.

===Fan-shaped===
The [[hemicycle]] or semi-circular seating configuration originated in late 18th century France when the post-revolutionary leaders selected the [[amphitheater]] form as one that would symbolize and foster unity, in contrast to the "impression of parliamentary fragmentation" of the British configuration.&lt;ref&gt;Manow, P.23&lt;/ref&gt;  This configuration was soon emulated in other parts of Europe and in the United States Congress, the Capitol Building being designed by French architect [[Benjamin Latrobe]].  This adoption of the ancient Greek theater form coincided with the [[Greek revival]] movements in architecture, including literal use of the symbology of the ancient democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aoc.gov/capitol-hill/architecture-styles/neoclassical-architecture-capitol-hill ''Capitol Hill Neoclassical Architecture,'' Architect of the Capitol].  Retrieved 2016-04-14&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Its form allows for presentation by a single person, or small group, to speak or present to all members of the chamber on a face-to-face basis from a podium (or similar element) at the focal point of the room.  The primary hierarchy of position is largely distance from the podium, and is not in a position of support or opposition.  This position gives pride of place to the podium, is not inherently partisan, and if each member of the group is given the chance to address the group, everyone has a (theoretically) equal position.

===Circular===
Circular seating configurations for places of discourse have been envisioned as early as the 12th Century story of the [[Knights of the Round Table]].  As with many later versions, this was intended to be a collaborative forum.  In the late 1940s, facilities for the [[United Nations Security Council]], a body formed during and immediately after the [[World War II|world's greatest conflict]], were designed to support collaboration and avoid confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/sc/suborg/en/subsidiary/msc/relationships_collaboration UN Security Council, Relationships and Collaboration].

Retrieved 2016-04-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 1990s, several debating chambers have been constructed that support, or were designed to support, [[consensus]]-style or [[collaboration]]-style discourse and government.  These include legislative assembly facilities for [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] and non-indigenous peoples in Northern Canada, Great Britain, and Polynesia.  Most are for bodies that do not involve formal political parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assembly.gov.nt.ca/visitors/what-consensus ''What is Consensus Government?'' - Government of the Northwest Territories].

Retrieved 2016-04-12&lt;/ref&gt; has influenced debate and extended the audience well beyond the physical location of the debate chamber.  More recently this has developed into direct two-way communication in small and large meeting rooms ([[virtual event]]s), and even through personal hand-held devices into nearly every corner of the world.  This has both changed the nature of the physical nature of the debating environment into a digital and virtual one, and in a non-literal sense into a series of ever-changing and highly varied configuration and collection of spaces determined by where each debate participant happens to be located. This may also have the added effect of drawing others into the debate, whether as passive observers or active participants, unwittingly, uninvited, or by active invitation of a single participant.  For those meetings or debates who remain grounded in a structured location, such as a conference room or legislative chamber who connect to one or several remote participants via video-conferencing, the configuration of the room may be re-focused onto the video screen and away from those in the room.

The '''Democratic Labour Party''' was a small [[United Kingdom|British]] [[left-wing]] [[political party]] in [[Walsall]], sometimes known as the Walsall Democratic Labour Party. It was founded as a breakaway from the Labour Party after left-wing members were expelled in the mid-90s.

==Origins 1995–1999==
Dave Church (known as "Citizen Dave"), his deputy John Rothery, and others on the left of Walsall [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had supported a policy of radical [[decentralisation]] of power since the early 1980s, but the [[right-wing]] of the party had held power as [[Metropolitan Borough of Walsall]] councillors, preventing the enactment of the policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=Steve|title=The changing role of local politics in Britain|publisher=The Policy Press|year=2006|chapter=Case study: Decentralisation in Walsall|isbn=1-86134-607-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1vune4_PhpoC&amp;pg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1995, after three years during which the left-wing councillors were suspended from the party for 'operating their own caucus', the left gained control of the council. They sacked nine council department heads, proposing to replace them with 54 directly-elected neighbourhood councils. The spectre of the "[[Loony left]]" alarmed Labour Party central office, who suspended the district party that August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/so-just-how-loony-are-they-in-walsall-1595560.html|title=So, just how loony are they in Walsall?|last=Rentoul|first=John|author2=Nicholas Schoon|date=10 August 1995|work=The Independent|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/citizen-dave-decries-malaise-of-dictatorship-1596554.html|title=Citizen Dave decries 'malaise of dictatorship'|last=McKie|first=John|date=17 August 1995|work=The Independent|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church faced claims of 'intimidation tactics',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/prescott-interrogates-walsalls-citizen-dave-1577289.html|title=Prescott interrogates Walsall's Citizen Dave|last=Victor|first=Peter|date=13 October 1995|work=The Independent|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Church, Rothery and Brian Powell were expelled from the Labour Party by the [[National Executive Committee]] in November 1995 for running a "party within a party" called the Walsall Socialist Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/12/modlocalgov.localgovernment2|title=A step in the right direction|last=Parker|first=Simon|date=12 March 2003|work=The Guardian|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/labour-removes-extremist-council-chief-1584282.html|title=Labour removes 'extremist' council chief|last=Rentoul|first=John|date=30 November 1995|work=The Independent|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/town-hall-chaos-as-church-sticks-to-his-guns-1525440.html|title=Town Hall chaos as Church sticks to his guns|last=Wynn Davies|first=Patricia|date=13 December 1995|work=The Independent|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven councillors in all broke away from the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/local_elections_98/in_your_area/81412.stm|title=The West Midlands|last=Hess|first=John|date=30 April 1998|work=Vote '98|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the 10 Democratic Labour candidates in the [[Walsall Council election, 1998|1998 local elections]] won a seat, losing four seats including that of the deputy leader John Rothery to Labour. Labour returned to overall control of the council, and Democratic Labour were left with six councillors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-17521225.html|title=Labour rebels are crushed|date=8 May 1998|work=Birmingham Evening Mail|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/birmingham-post-england-the/mi_7996/is_1998_May_8/labour-crushes-town-hall-revolution/ai_n35892185/|title=New Labour crushes town hall revolution and takes control|date=8 May 1998|work=The Birmingham Post|accessdate=9 February 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party lost its remaining seats in the [[Walsall Council election, 1999|1999 election]], three to Labour and three to the Conservatives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/birmingham-post-england-the/mi_7996/is_1999_May_7/disastrous-breakaway-socialists-walsall/ai_n36035637/|title=Disastrous night for breakaway socialists; WALSALL|last=Hardy|first=Simon|date=7 May 1999|work=The Birmingham Post|accessdate=9 February 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and despite standing 15 candidates at the [[Walsall Council election, 2000|2000 election]] did not win back any seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-17635323.html|title=Spotlight on Black Country election nominations|date=5 April 2000|work=Birmingham Evening Mail|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joined by other local left-wingers, they helped set up their local [[Socialist Alliance (England)|Socialist Alliance]], and stood as candidates under its banner in elections until it was disbanded. Dave Church stood for the Socialist Alliance in [[Walsall North (UK Parliament constituency)|Walsall North]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]], gaining 410 votes (1.3%).&lt;ref name=north&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/constituency/1396/walsall-north|title=Walsall North|work=The Guardian|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of the European Union}}
The '''Directorate-General for Interpretation''' (shortly called '''DG Interpretation''' and commonly abbreviated as '''SCIC''' for its former [[French language|French]] name ''Service Commun Interprétation-Conférences'') is a [[Directorate-General]] of the [[European Commission]]. It is the European Commission's [[language interpretation|interpreting]] service and [[Convention (meeting)|conference]] organiser and provides [[language interpretation|interpreters]] for around 11,000 meetings every year, thus being the largest interpreting service in the world.

DG Interpretation manages the allocation of Commission meeting rooms and provides support for the smooth running of meetings in many languages that are held there. It also organises conferences for [[European Civil Service#Directorates-General|Directorates-General and departments of the Commission]], typically in the range of over 40 main events per year.

As of 2013, head of DG Interpretation is [[Marco Benedetti]], Director-General, and it refers to [[Androulla Vassiliou]], [[European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth]].

'''[[Ebrahim Raisi]]''', chairman of [[Astan Quds Razavi]] launched his election campaign for [[Iranian presidential election, 2017|2017 presidential election]] in April 2017.

== Early stages ==
In February 2017, [[Ebrahim Raisi]] was said to be backed by the [[Front of Islamic Revolution Stability]] and emerging as the [[Iranian Principlists|conservative camp]] consensus candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/02/iran-ebrahim-raisi-conservative-candidate-unity-presidential.html|title=Meet the powerful Iranian cleric looking to unseat Rouhani|publisher=Al-Monitor|date=21 February 2017|access-date=21 February 2017|author=Rohollah Faghihi}}&lt;/ref&gt; A senior member of the front told press that his party tried to “persuade Ebrahim Raisi to run in the elections, but did not succeed”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.thearabweekly.com/Iran/7838/Iran%E2%80%99s-conservatives-scramble-to-find-a-presidential-candidate|title=Iran’s conservatives scramble to find a presidential candidate|publisher=The Arab Weekly|date=19 February 2017|access-date=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 February 2017, Raisi won the majority of votes during the meeting held by [[Popular Front of Islamic Revolution Forces]], a newly established umbrella organization of conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.stratfor.com/situation-report/iran-possible-conservative-presidential-candidate-emerges|title=Iran: Possible Conservative Presidential Candidate Emerges|publisher=[[Stratfor]]|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

50 out of the 88 members of the [[Assembly of Experts]], whose names has not been disclosed, have signed a letter supporting Raisi for president in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/03/iran-ebrahim-raisi-presidential-candidate-quds-razavi.html|title=The surprising rise of the head of Iran's most influential charity|work=Al-Monitor|access-date=30 March 2017|date=18 April 2017|author=Arash Karami}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Branding ==
[[File:Ebrahim Raisi at Interior Ministry for presidential nomination 09.jpg|thumb|Raisi speaking after registration]] 
Raisi's campaign pursues a [[Populism|populist]] agenda.&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.ft.com/content/99dc3918-2110-11e7-a454-ab04428977f9|title=Rouhani confirms he will seek second term in Iran elections|work=Financial Times|access-date=22 April 2017|date=14 April 2017|author= Najmeh Bozorgmehr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It focuses on presenting him as a symbol of [[Mohammad Beheshti]], Iran's chief justice assassinated in 1981.&lt;ref name="TT"/&gt; His campaign portrays him as "[[:wikt:man of the people|man of the people]]"; when [[Mashhad]] was hit by an earthquake in early April, he cancelled his meeting in [[Tehran]] and said “it is necessary to be with the religious people of this land”.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.ft.com/content/ac0befba-1abd-11e7-bcac-6d03d067f81f|title=Iran’s hardliners nominate 5 candidates for presidential race|work=Financial Times|access-date=22 April 2017|date=6 April 2017|author= Najmeh Bozorgmehr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raisi has publicized pictures of his visits to poverty-stricken areas in remote villages,&lt;ref name="IP"/&gt; and opening an apartment complex for the families of [[Liwa Fatemiyoun|Afghan fighters]] killed in [[Syrian civil war]].&lt;ref name="RFE"&gt;{{citation|url=https://gandhara.rferl.org/a/iran-emerging-hardliner-raisi/28415680.html|title=In Iran, Emerging Hard-Liner Stakes Future On Unseating Rohani|work=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|access-date=22 April 2017|date=7 April 2017|author=Golnaz Esfandiari}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 April 2017, Raisi wrote an [[open letter]] to [[Hassan Rouhani]], recommending him to “observe moral codes”.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/412728/Raisi-writes-letters-to-about-Rouhani|title=Raisi writes letters to, about Rouhani|work=Tehran Times|access-date=22 April 2017|date=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raisi's campaign symbol is "[[Iranian national identity card|National identity card]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.farsnews.com/MediaDisplay.aspx?nn=13960210001809|title=فیلم/ "کارت ملی" نماد دولت رئیسی شد|date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 15 May 2017, conservative candidate [[Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf]] withdrew his candidacy in favor of Raisi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://thewire.in/136181/qalibaf-withdraws-backs-raisi-president/|title=Iran: Tehran Mayor Qalibaf Withdraws, Backs Hardliner Raisi for President|date=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculation that Ghalibaf will be Raisi's [[Vice President of Iran|first vice president]] if he elect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/05/iran-presidential-election-ghalibaf-raisi-withdraw-first-vp.html|title=The reason Tehran's mayor dropped out of presidential race|date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also joined in a campaign rally in [[Tehran]] with each other.

== Media coverage ==
Iranian moderates and [[Iranian Reformists|reformists]] have criticized Iran's state-run television, [[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting]] (IRIB), for "excessively reporting" on Raisi. According to ''[[Etemaad]]'' newspaper, the television has been showing Raisi as the prayer Imam regularly in recent days. Raisi however wrote an [[open letter]] to IRIB head [[Abdulali Ali-Asgari]], claiming it has 'biased advertisements' toward Rouhani because of coverage of his speeches as the [[President of Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/04/iran-ebrahim-raisi-open-letter-state-tv-irib-rouhani-bias.html|title=Raisi slams Iran state TV for coverage 'biased' toward Rouhani|publisher=Al-Monitor|date=19 April 2017|access-date=21 April 2017|author=Rohollah Faghihi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social media activity ===
In March 2017, a determined campaign began in social media with circulating pictures of mostly young people, including liberal-looking women loosely wearing a ''[[hijab]]'', holding pictures with the [[hashtag]] #RaisiCome ({{lang-fa|#رئیسی_بيا}}).&lt;ref name="RFE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RZ"/&gt;

[[File:Ebrahim Raisi presidential campaign rally in Tehran, 29 April 2017 17.jpg|thumb|250px|Raisi' speech in [[Tehran]]]]
Raisi has said “I see the activation of a [[resistance economy]] as the only way to end poverty and deprivation in the country”.&lt;ref name="RFE"/&gt; He supports development of the agricultural sector, rather than spending money on shopping malls, which “will eventually benefit foreign brands”.&lt;ref name="FT"/&gt; Raisi sees [[economic sanctions]] as an opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://aftabnews.ir/fa/news/444926/%D8%B1%D8%A6%DB%8C%D8%B3%DB%8C-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%85-%DB%8C%DA%A9-%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%B5%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%85-%DA%A9%D9%86%DB%8C%D9%85|title=رئیسی: تحریم یک فرصت است/باید خود را مقاوم کنیم |date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elterngeld''' (translated literally from German as ''parents' money''), is a tax-financed payment for [[wikt:couple|couples]] which pays an amount of money to support the costs of bringing up a child. Elterngeld schemes exists in Germany, France, and [[Scandinavia]].

It generally does not provide full support of the costs of bringing up a child. It is only provided for a limited period, ranging from until one year after birth until 18 years of age in Norway. The amount of Elterngeld granted depends in some places on the income of the parents.

==Need for==
The need for Elterngeld schemes is illustrated by the declining birth rates in Western European countries. For instance, in Germany the present birth rate is 1.3 children per woman, which is below what is calculated at the economically stable rate of 2.1 children per woman. 25 European Union states currently have birth rates below this level. The issues behind the declining birth rate include the higher costs of maintaining a child, and the greater dependence within the household budget economically on women.

==Criticism==
Elterngeld is effectively a third state-level subsidy for some parents&amp;nbsp;– on top of maternity allowance and state income benefits. Economists argue that this has created a complex and costly system of state benefit which could be simplified and reduced in expenses.

Economists and critics also argue that the allowance creates shifting birth patterns. In December 2006, media reports suggested that German parents were seeking ways to delay the births of their children until 1 January 2007, so that they would gain access to Elterngeld of up to 25,200 euros (two-thirds of their former salary for up to a year), up from 7,200 euros per annum.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6211737.stm BBC NEWS | World | Europe | Pregnant Germans seek cash bonus&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries==
*Germany – 7,200 euros per annum for up to one year, rising to 25,200 euros (two-thirds of their former salary) for up to one year per child born from 1 January 2007 on&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;
*France – an allowance of 750 euros per month for one year from September 2005{{Citation needed|reason=where is this number from?|date=February 2017}}. The money is focused on existing parents producing more children than on first-time parents, with present discussion around allowances for third children. This has meant a higher birth rate at lower cost to the state than in other countries. The French government's goal is to raise the birth rate from 1.9 children per woman to at least 2.1 children per woman
*[[Sweden]] – up to one year at 80 percent wage level compensation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} Further four months can an overall basic amount be paid. Additionally the parents may shorten their work time without wage adjustment over up to two hours daily, until the child is eight years old. The increase of the birth rate in Sweden is attributed to this practice. Most other Scandinavian countries follow similar percentage level of salary Elterngeld payment levels{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}
*[[Norway]] – up to two years at 80 percent wage level compensation, or alternatively for 42 weeks at 100 percent (this is for maternity leave, not monthly payment until age of 18){{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}
*[[Finland]] – parents' money is paid for nine months{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}
*[[Denmark]] – for at least six months{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Elterngeld and gender==

Several proposals have been offered to use elterngeld-style payments to combat the effects of [[sex-selective abortion]] in Asia.

The '''''Estimate of the Situation''''' was a document supposedly written in 1948 by the personnel of [[United States Air Force]]'s [[Project Sign]] - including the project's director, Captain [[Robert R. Sneider]] - which explained their reasons for concluding that the [[extraterrestrial hypothesis]] was the best explanation for [[unidentified flying object]]s.

As late as 1960,{{sfn|Clark|1988}} USAF personnel stated that the document never existed. However, several Air Force officers, and one consultant, claim the report as being a real document that was suppressed. [[Jenny Randles]] and [[Peter Hough]] describe the ''Estimate'' as the "[[Holy Grail]] of [[ufology]]" and state that [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests for the document have been fruitless.{{sfn|Randles|1994|p=85}}

==Chiles-Whitted Encounter==
Though Sign investigated earlier UFO reports, historian [[David M. Jacobs]] writes that the highly publicized [[Chiles-Whitted UFO Encounter]] of July 24, 1948 "had a great impact at Sign".{{sfn|Jacobs|1975|p=47}} In that encounter, two experienced airline pilots claimed a torpedo-shaped object nearly collided with their commercial airplane. Sign personnel judged the report convincing and compelling, partly because the alleged object also closely matched the description of an independent sighting from [[The Hague]] a few days earlier.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

According to [[Michael D. Swords]],{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Sign personnel "intensely investigated" the Chiles-Whitted sighting for several months. Despite the lack of physical evidence, some Sign personnel judged this and other UFO reports quite persuasive, and concluded that UFOs could have only a non-earthly source.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Swords writes,
 {{Quotation|The project members reasoned that they had several dozen aerial observations that they could not explain, many of them by military pilots and scientists. The objects seemed to act like real [[technology]], but their sources said they were not ours. The flying fuselage encounter [Chiles-Whitted] intrigued them. The [[Ludwig Prandtl|Prandtl theory]] of [[lift (force)|lift]] indicated that such an odd shape ''can'' fly, but it would need some form of power plant advanced well beyond what we could build (e.g., nuclear)."{{sfn|Swords|2000|p=93}}}}

Given that there was no evidence that either the U.S. or the [[U.S.S.R.]] had anything remotely like the UFOs reported, Sign personnel gradually began considering extraterrestrial origins for the objects.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Swords argues that this consideration of non-earthly origin was "not as incredible in intelligence circles as one might think." Because many in the military were "pilots, engineers and technical people" they had a "'can do' attitude" and tended to regard unavailable technologies not as impossibilities, but as challenges to be overcome. Rather than dismissing UFO reports out of hand, they considered how such objects might function. This perspective, argues Swords, "contrasted markedly with many scientists' characterizations of such concepts as impossible, unthinkable or [[Absurdity|absurd]]."{{sfn|Swords|2000|p=93}}

==Rejection ==
According to Ruppelt, the ''Estimate'' was rejected by Vandenberg primarily due to lack of supporting physical evidence, and was "batted back down" the chain of command. In a letter dated November 3, 1948, Cabell wrote to Sign, via McCoy, describing flying saucers as real, but rejecting the interplanetary hypothesis and asking for another Estimate.

Cabell wrote:
{{Quotation|The conclusion appears inescapable that some type of flying object has been observed. Identification and the origin of these objects is not discernible to this Headquarters. It is imperative, therefore, that efforts to determine whether these objects are of domestic or foreign origin must be increased until conclusive evidence is obtained. The needs of national defense require such evidence in order that appropriate countermeasures may be taken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.project1947.com/fig/1948b.htm Cabell Memo To AMC - 3 NOV 1948]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

McCoy responded in a somewhat defensive letter dated November 8, 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.project1947.com/fig/1948c.htm McCoy Memo - 1948]&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that many of the UFO reports were misidentified everyday phenomena (see [[Identified flying object]]), but also restated the rejected ideas of the ''Estimate'' without explicitly endorsing the interplanetary hypothesis; as Swords writes," [Project Sign] just had their knuckles rapped, so they defended themselves."{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

McCoy wrote,
{{Quotation|[T]here remains a certain number of reports for which no reasonable everyday explanation is available. So far, no physical evidence of the existence of the unidentified sightings has been obtained...The possibility that the reported objects are vehicles from another planet has not been ignored. However, tangible evidence to support conclusions about such a possibility are completely lacking...{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}}}

When Sign personnel refused to abandon the interplanetary hypothesis, many were reassigned, and Sign was renamed [[Project Grudge]] in 1949. According to Ruppelt, "The ''Estimate'' died a quick death. Some months later it was completely declassified and relegated to the incinerator. A few copies, one of which I saw, were kept as mementos of the golden days of the UFOs."{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Publicity==
The first public report of the ''Estimate'' was in Captain [[Edward J. Ruppelt]]'s 1956 book, ''The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects''.

He wrote:
{{Quotation|In intelligence, if you have something to say about some vital problem you write a report that is known as an ''Estimate of the Situation''. A few days after the [[DC-3]] was buzzed [the Chiles-Whitted UFO report], the people at ATIC decided that the time had arrived to make an Estimate of the Situation. The situation was the UFOs; the estimate was that they were interplanetary!...It was a rather thick document with a black cover and it was printed on legal sized paper. Stamped across the front were the words [[TOP SECRET]]...It contained the Air Force's analysis of many of the [UFO] incidents I have told you about plus many similar ones. All of them had come from scientists, pilots, and other equally credible observers, and each one was an unknown{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} ...When the estimate was completed, typed, and approved, it started up through channels to higher command echelons. It drew considerable comment but no one stopped it on its way up.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}}}

Clark notes that "No copies of this near-legendary document have surfaced since."{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Ruppelt's 1956 book, which first publicly disclosed the ''Estimate'', was cleared by the Air Force.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Clark writes,{{sfn|Clark|1988}} that as late as 1960, Air Force officials denied that the ''Estimate'' was real, despite the fact that censors had approved Ruppelt's book a few years before. According to Clark,{{sfn|Clark|1988}} the U.S. Air Force later formally admitted the ''Estimate'' was real, but Clark's bibliography does not make clear what statement or document confirmed the ''Estimate''{{'}}s reality.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Additionally, according to Clark, the ''Estimate''{{'}}s existence was confirmed by U.S. Air Force Major [[Dewey J. Fournet]], who as an Air Force major in the Pentagon served as liaison with official UFO project headquartered at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]].{{sfn|Clark|1988|p=178}} Fournet has been described{{by whom|date=September 2015}} as being "unimpressed" with the ''Estimate'', and was furthermore quoted as describing  the ET conclusion as an "extreme extrapolation" based on scant evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Greenwood | first = Barry | authorlink = | title = UFOS: GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT, SECRECY, AND DOCUMENTS | website = PROJECT 1947 | url = http://www.project1947.com/bg/ufogov.htm | accessdate = September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Air Force consultant, astronomer Dr. [[Allen Hynek]], also verified the ''Estimate''{{’}}s existence.{{sfn|Hynek|1973}}

'''Fassa Association''' (''Associazione Fassa''), often referred simply as '''Fassa''' (''Fassa''), is a minor [[Christian democracy|Christian-democratic]] [[list of political parties in Italy|political party]] in [[Trentino]], [[Italy]]. The party seeks to represent the [[Ladin language|Ladin]] minority in the Province and especially Ladins living in [[Fassa Valley]].

==History==
Fassa was formed as '''Fassa List''' (''Lista Fassa'') in August 2008 as a centre-right alternative to the centre-left [[Ladin Autonomist Union]] (UAL), which used to garner a large majority of Ladin votes in Fassa Valley. Its first leader was [[Gino Fontana]], mayor of [[Vigo di Fassa]] and, formerly, provincial councillor for [[Daisy Civic List]], a centrist party aligned with the centre-left. A year later, the List was institutionalised and became a fully fledged party under the current name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladige.it/articoli/2009/05/16/centrodestra-rilancianasce-progetto-fassa |title=Il centrodestra rilanciaNasce "Progetto Fassa" &amp;#124; L'Adige |publisher=Ladige.it |date= |accessdate=2014-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714225322/http://www.ladige.it/articoli/2009/05/16/centrodestra-rilancianasce-progetto-fassa |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol provincial elections, 2008#Trentino|2008 provincial election]] the party won 0.6% of the vote (26.6% in Fassa Valley), while the UAL gained 1.2% (54.0%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elezioni2008.provincia.tn.it/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306204316/http://www.elezioni2008.provincia.tn.it/ |date=March 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012 the party replaced its leadership during an assembly: [[Elena Testor]] was elected president and [[Luca Guglielmi]] secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trentinocorrierealpi.gelocal.it/cronaca/2012/03/23/news/l-associazione-fassa-guarda-avanti-1.4127499 |title=L-Associazione Fassa guarda avanti - Cronaca - Trentino Corriere Alpi |publisher=Trentinocorrierealpi.gelocal.it |date=2012-03-23 |accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013 [[Riccardo Franceschetti]], mayor of [[Moena]] and leading member of the UAL, left that party in order to join Fassa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.gelocal.it/trentinocorrierealpi/archivio/trentinocorrierealpi/2013/09/27/NZ_52_A.html |title="In valle serve più decisione" - Trentino |language=it |publisher=Ricerca.gelocal.it |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol provincial elections, 2013#Trentino|2013 provincial election]] the party won 0.8% of the vote (31.9% in Fassa Valley), but still lost to the UAL, which gained 1.1% (51.8%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elezioni-2013.provincia.tn.it/ |title=Elezioni 2013 - Provincia autonoma di Trento |publisher=Elezioni-2013.provincia.tn.it |date= |accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2015, the party prevailed over the UAL in the first Fassa community election and Testor was elected Attorney General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comunitavalle.provincia.tn.it/binary/pat_comunita_valle/elezioni_fassa_2015/composizione_Consei_componenti_eletti.1439207201.pdf |title=Data |date=2015 |website=www.comunitavalle.provincia.tn.it |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladige.it/territori/fiemme-fassa/2015/05/19/fassa-oggi-linsediamento-procuradora-elena-testor|title=Fassa, oggi l'insediamento della procuradora Elena Testor|first=|last=r.moser@ladige.it|date=19 May 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings''''' is a 600-page (Urdu version), 512-page (English version) Islamic decree by scholar [[Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri]] which demonstrates from the Quran and Sunnah that terrorism and suicide bombings are unjust and evil, and thus un-Islamic. It was published in London as a book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minhajpublications.com/?p=490 Fatwa on Terrorism &amp; Suicide Bombings BOOK] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129040856/http://www.minhajpublications.com/?p=490 |date=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The English edition was published in the UK by Minhaj-ul-Quran Publications. Qadri released the fatwa on 2 March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/03/30/tor-ul-qadri-gta.html Influential Pakistani cleric based in GTA]&lt;/ref&gt; 

This [[fatwa]] is a direct refutation of the ideology of [[Al-Qaeda]] and the [[Taliban]]. It is one of the most extensive Islamic anti-terrorism rulings, an "absolute" condemnation of terrorism without "any excuses or pretexts" which goes further than ever and declares that [[terrorism]] is [[Kafir|kufr]] under [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sheikh-issues-fatwa-against-all-terrorists-1915000.html|title=Sheikh issues fatwa against all terrorists|work=The Independent|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch was organised by [[Minhaj-ul-Quran UK]]. Qadri said during the launch that "Terrorism is terrorism, violence is violence and it has no place in Islamic teaching and no justification can be provided for it, or any kind of excuses or ifs or buts."

==Overview==
The fatwa received widespread media attention and was positively covered by the international press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2010/03/02/tahir-ul-qadri-and-the-difficulty-of-reporting-on-fatwas/|title=Tahir ul-Qadri and the difficulty of reporting on fatwas|work=Reuters|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to CNN, some experts see the fatwa as a significant blow to terrorist recruiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/03/03/terror.fatwa.analysis/index.html|title=Some experts see fatwa as significant blow to terrorist recruiting|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNN's [[Amanpour]] show added the fatwa summary to its website and declared it to be fatwa for peace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amanpour.blogs.cnn.com/2010/03/11/fatwa-for-peace/|title=Fatwa for Peace|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the US [[State Department]] declares the fatwa to be significant step in taking Islam back from terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/mar/03/muslim-leaders-edict-decries-terrorism/|title=Muslim leader's edict decries terrorism - Washington Times|work=The Washingtion Times|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before it had been released, [[Douglas Murray (author)|Douglas Murray]] described the Fatwa on Terrorism, in an article in the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', as "potentially important", although he said "A single-fatwa will not change the level of denial and self criticism inherent in so much of modern Islam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23810140-is-this-a-triumph-for-the-islamic-peacemakers.do |title=Is this a triumph for the Islamic peacemakers? |work=The Evening Standard |accessdate=1 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122104015/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23810140-is-this-a-triumph-for-the-islamic-peacemakers.do |archivedate=22 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] news channel questioned the credibility of the fatwa and asks if it was not by the [[British government]] because senior [[counter-terrorism]] officials from [[Scotland Yard]] and [[MI5]] were present at the launch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itv.com/news/fatwa-condemns-terror52128/ Fatwa condemns terror]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606053826/http://www.itv.com/news/fatwa-condemns-terror52128/ |date=June 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 512-page English book version of the fatwa, ''Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings'', (London: Minhaj-ul-Quran, 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-9551888-9-3}}) has a foreword by [[John Esposito]] and an introduction by [[Joel Hayward]], both of whom share Qadri's scholarly assessment that, regardless of any intention, the evil of terrorism remains evil and must be exposed, opposed and condemned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minhajpublications.com/?p=33 English version of published Fatwa on Terrorism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207225900/http://www.minhajpublications.com/?p=33 |date=February 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fatwa on Terrorism has been officially endorsed by [[Al-Azhar University]] in Cairo, Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yanabi.com/index.php?/topic/415493-drtahir-ul-qadris-histroic-fatwa-cetrtification-from-by-al-azhar-university|title=Dr.Tahir-ul-Qadri鈥檚 Historic Fatwa cetrtification from by Al-Azhar University|work=Spirit Of Islam|accessdate=1 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202011942/http://www.yanabi.com/index.php?%2Ftopic%2F415493-drtahir-ul-qadris-histroic-fatwa-cetrtification-from-by-al-azhar-university|archivedate=2 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minhajpublications.com/?p=33 Al-Azhar University Certification] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207225900/http://www.minhajpublications.com/?p=33 |date=February 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, the fatwa was discussed at the [[World Economic Forum]] Annual Meeting 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/sessions/summary/reality-terrorism|title=The Reality of Terrorism|work=The Reality of Terrorism - World Economic Forum|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, Pope Benedict XVI received a copy of the fatwa from representatives of Minhaj Interfaith Relations. The Pope reportedly appreciated that it promoted peace, harmony and interfaith dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Regional/Lahore/24-Jun-2011/Minhaj-man-meets-Pope Minhaj man meets Pope]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interfaithrelations.com/english/tid/14224/Fatwa-on-Terrorism-presented-to-Pope-Benedict-XVI-in-Vatican-City-Minhaj-man-Fatwa-on-Terrorism-and-Suicide-Bombings-issued-by-Shaykh-ul-Islam-Dr-Muhammad-Tahir-ul-Qadri|title=Fatwa on Terrorism presented to Pope Benedict XVI in Vatican City - Interfaith Relations|author=Interfaith Relations|work=Interfaith Relations|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fatwa on Terrorism has been reviewed positively by international scholars including Kemal Argon who published a review in ''The Journal of Rotterdam Islamic and Social Sciences'', Vol. 2, No. 1, 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;149–160. Islamic University of Rotterdam, Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatwaonterrorism.com/fatwa-on-terrorism/fatwa-reviews/ |title=Fatwa Reviews |publisher= |accessdate=1 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202002910/http://www.fatwaonterrorism.com/fatwa-on-terrorism/fatwa-reviews/ |archivedate=2 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Free State Project''' ('''FSP''') is a proposed [[political migration]] founded in 2001 to recruit at least 20,000 [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarians]] to move to a single low-population state ([[New Hampshire]], selected in 2003) in order to make the state a stronghold for libertarian ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Libertarians Pursue New Political Goal: State of Their Own|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/27/us/libertarians-pursue-new-political-goal-state-of-their-own.html?pagewanted=all|first=Pam|last=Belluck|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 27, 2003|accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project seeks to overcome the historical ineffectiveness of [[limited government]] activism which they believe was caused by the small number and diffuse population of libertarian activists across the 50 United States and around the world.

Participants sign a statement of intent declaring that they intend to move to New Hampshire within five years of the drive reaching 20,000 participants. This statement of intent is intended to function as a form of [[assurance contract]]. {{As of|2016|2|3|df=US}}, 20,000 people have signed this statement of intent&lt;ref name=membership&gt;{{cite web|title=Free State Project Triggers the Move|url=https://www.fsp.org/free-state-project-triggers-the-move-libertarians-new-hampshire/|publisher=Free State Project|accessdate=June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;—completing the original goal—and 1,909 people are listed as "early movers" to New Hampshire on the FSP website, saying they had made their move prior to the 20,000-participant trigger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2296999/|title=Free State Project: What happens if 20,000 libertarians move to New Hampshire?|work=Slate Magazine|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately a dozen Free Staters were elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives in the 2012 election&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jake|last=Berry|url=http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/news/994856-469/movement-starts-slowly-but-future-encouraging.html|title=Free State project says future is encouraging|work=Nashua Telegraph|date=February 24, 2013|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 18 in the 2014 election.

The FSP is a social movement generally based upon [[decentralized decision making]]. The group hosts various events, but most of FSP's activities depend upon volunteers, and no formal plan dictates to participants or movers what their actions should be in New Hampshire.

==Intent==
The FSP mission statement, adopted in 2005, states: {{Cquote|The Free State Project is an agreement among 20,000 pro-liberty activists to move to New Hampshire, where they will exert the fullest practical effort toward the creation of a society in which the maximum role of government is the protection of life, liberty, and property. The success of the Project would likely entail reductions in taxation and regulation, reforms at all levels of government to expand individual rights and free markets, and a restoration of constitutional federalism, demonstrating the benefits of liberty to the rest of the nation and the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freestateproject.org/about/mission.php Mission Statement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118215151/http://freestateproject.org/about/mission.php |date=January 18, 2013 }} from the Free State Project website&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Life, liberty, and property" are rights that were enumerated in the October 1774 [[Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress | url= http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/resolves.asp | date= October 14, 1774 | work= [[Avalon Project]] | publisher= [[Yale Law School]] | accessdate=November 11, 2010| quote=That the inhabitants of the English colonies in North-America, by the immutable laws of nature, the principles of the English constitution, and the several charters or compacts, have the following RIGHTS:  Resolved, N.C.D. 1. That they are entitled to life, liberty and property: and they have never ceded to any foreign power whatever, a right to dispose of either without their consent.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Constitution of New Hampshire#Article 12–a. Eminent domain|Article 12]] of the [[Constitution of New Hampshire|New Hampshire Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nh.gov/constitution/billofrights.html|title=NH.gov – The Official Web Site of New Hampshire State Government – State Constitution, Bill of Rights|work=nh.gov|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To become a participant of the Free State Project, a person is asked to agree to the Statement of Intent (SOI): {{Cquote|I hereby state my solemn intent to move to the State of New Hampshire within 5 years after 20,000 Participants have signed up. Once there, I will exert the fullest practical effort toward the creation of a society in which the maximum role of civil government is the protection of individuals' life, liberty, and property.}}

==Eligibility==
The FSP is open to people with a minimum age of 18 and United States citizenship is not required; people who promote violence, racial hatred, or bigotry are not welcome in the FSP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fsp.org/disclaimer-policies/ FSP Disclaimer and Policies]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
The Free State Project was founded in 2001 by [[Jason Sorens]], then a Ph.D. student at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Larry Clow |url=http://www.wirenh.com/Features/Cover_Story/the_Free_State_turns_two_20051005785.html |title=The Free State turns two |publisher=The Wire |date=October 5, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017050136/http://www.wirenh.com/Features/Cover_Story/the_Free_State_turns_two_20051005785.html |archivedate=October 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorens published an article in ''[[The Libertarian Enterprise]]'' highlighting the failure of libertarians to elect any candidate to federal office and outlining his ideas for a [[secession]]ist movement, calling people to respond to him with interest.&lt;ref name="tlesoren"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Sorens | first= Jason | url= http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle2001/libe131-20010723-03.html | title=Announcement: The Free State Project | journal=The Libertarian Enterprise | volume=131 | date=July 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorens soon published a follow-up article &lt;ref name="sorensfollowup"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Sorens | first= Jason | url= http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle2001/libe133-20010806-02.html | title=Update: Free State Project | journal=The Libertarian Enterprise | volume=132| date=August 6, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; backing away from secession, "and it never played a role in the FSP’s philosophy from then on.&lt;ref name="fsphistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Early Years of the Free State Project|url=https://www.fsp.org/history/|publisher=Free State Project|accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Sorens has stated that the movement continues an American tradition of [[political migration]], which includes groups such as [[Mormon]] settlers in [[Utah]], [[Amish]] religious communities&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web| author=Joanna Walters | url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/01/usa.joannawalters | title=Free staters pick New Hampshire to liberate for sex, guns and drugs | work= [[The Guardian]] | date=October 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Jamestown Seventy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&amp;context=yrlsa |first1=James F. |last1=Blumstein |first2=James |last2=Phelan |title=Jamestown Seventy |date=1971 |journal=[[Yale Review of Law and Social Action]] |volume=1 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; an earlier effort to influence the politics of a particular state through deliberate migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Libertarian Enterprise |volume=132 |date=August 6, 2001 |title=Update: Free State Project |last=Sorens |first=Jason |url=http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle2001/libe133-20010806-02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FSP Gadsden Flag.gif|thumb|left|The flag of the Free State Project, a modified [[Gadsden flag]]]]
The organization began without a specific state in mind. A systematic review started by narrowing potential states to those with a population of less than 1.5 million and those where the combined spending in 2000 by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] parties was less than $5.2 million, the total national spending by the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] in that year. [[Hawaii]] and [[Rhode Island]] were eliminated from this list because of their propensity for centralized government.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Spear, [http://www.libarts.ucok.edu/opsa/OPSR/Journal%20Vol5-Number1/4-Student%20Contri%20butions.pdf "An Experiment in Civic Engagement: The Free State Project"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325044314/http://www.libarts.ucok.edu/opsa/OPSR/Journal%20Vol5-Number1/4-Student%20Contri%20butions.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}, ''Oklahoma Policy Studies Review'', Vol. 5, No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===State selection===
In September 2003, the state vote was held and participants voted using the [[Condorcet method]] to choose the state.&lt;ref name="upandcoming"&gt;Pete Camp, [http://old.freestateproject.org/archives/state_vote/FSP-ECL-CertifyWhitePaper.htm "Free State Project Picks New Hampshire"], ''Up &amp; Coming Magazine'', October 8, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; New Hampshire was the winner, with Wyoming coming in second by a 57% to 43% margin.&lt;ref name="upandcoming" /&gt; Alaska, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Vermont were also on the list.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

New Hampshire was chosen because the perceived individualist culture of the state was thought to resonate well with libertarian ideals.&lt;ref name="boston"/&gt; However, the Free State Project has drawn criticism from some New Hampshire residents concerned about population pressure and opposition to increased taxation. On the other hand, some Republicans have responded more favorably to the project because they also favor a small government.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith Goldstein, [http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2003/10/09/free_state_project_pushes_limits_of_liberty_in_nh/ "Free State Project pushes limits of liberty in N.H."], ''Boston Globe'', October 19, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent events===
In December 2012, state representative [[Cynthia Chase]] (D-Keene) said "Free Staters are the single biggest threat the state is facing today. There is, legally, nothing we can do to prevent them from moving here to take over the state, which is their openly stated goal. In this country you can move anywhere you choose and they have that same right. What we can do is to make the environment here so unwelcoming that some will choose not to come, and some may actually leave. One way is to pass measures that will restrict the “freedoms” that they think they will find here".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/blog/2012/12/27/new-hampshire-democrat-free-staters-are|title=New Hampshire Democrat: 'Free Staters are the single biggest threat the state is facing today'|work=Reason.com|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Concord Police Department applied for $258,000 in federal government funding to buy a [[Lenco BearCat]] armored vehicle for protection against terrorist attacks, riots, or shooting incidents. The application said: "Groups such as the Sovereign Citizens, Free Staters and Occupy New Hampshire are active and present daily challenges". The grant from the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] was successful and the Concord City Council unanimously approved of the grant after having revised the application to remove references to those political movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wickham|first=Shawne K.|title=Civil Liberties Union questions increasing use of costly military-style equipment by NH law enforcement|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article/20130728/NEWS07/130729284|newspaper=Union Leader|date=July 27, 2013|location=Manchester, New Hampshire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, Republican Party Senate nominee [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]], a former [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Massachusetts]], said his election campaign needed "Freestaters" to support him in his one-minute closing statement at the Granite State Debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMtg48fQocE|title=Granite State Debate, U.S. Senate: Candidates deliver closing statements|date=September 4, 2014 |accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move triggered===
On February 3, 2016, the Free State Project announced via social media that 20,000 people had signed the Statement of Intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free State Project|publisher=[[Twitter]]|date=February 2, 2016|url=https://twitter.com/FreeStateNH/status/694763068010713088?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press conference later that day, then FSP president [[Carla Gericke]] officially announced that the move had been triggered and that signers were expected to follow up on their pledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freestateproject.org/blogs/free-state-project-officially-announces-20000-signers-100-reached|website=Freestateproject.org|date=2016|title=Official press conference announcing success in reaching 20,000 members}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project organization will change focus from recruiting signers to encouraging them to move to New Hampshire, stating "we want 20,000 movers".

==Political positions==
The Free State Project aligns itself with no political party, takes no official political positions, supports no candidates in elections and neither supports nor opposes any particular legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freestateproject.org/intro Introduction to the Free State Project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601025020/http://freestateproject.org/intro |date=June 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Free State Project receives its funding from individual donors interested in moving as part of the FSP or attending one of the annual events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freestateproject.org/files/FSPFY2008Actuals.pdf Total income donations, FSPFY2008Actuals.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816065430/http://freestateproject.org/files/FSPFY2008Actuals.pdf |date=August 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freestateproject.org/files/FSPFY2009-090331.pdf Total income donations FSPFY2009Actuals.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816065452/http://freestateproject.org/files/FSPFY2009-090331.pdf |date=August 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Donations are tax deductible as the FSP is a tax-exempt nonprofit educational organization, falling under category 501(c)(3). This affects all donations since July 20, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://madmimi.com/s/bc2215 FSP Newsletter], July 2014, From the President's Desk&lt;/ref&gt;

Several early movers have been elected to the New Hampshire legislature. In 2006, one of its participants, [[Joel Winters]], was elected to the [[New Hampshire General Court|state legislature]], running as a [[New Hampshire Democratic Party|Democrat]].&lt;ref name="boston"&gt;{{cite web| subscription=yes|author= Sarah Schweitzer | title=Free State Project cheers on one of its own in Winters | url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/11/26/free_state_project_cheers_one_of_its_own_in_winters/ | publisher=The Boston Globe | date=November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected in 2008, but defeated in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.nh.gov/electwinwin.html List of Nov. 2010 winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205082004/http://www.sos.nh.gov/electwinwin.html |date=February 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, 12 Republican Free Staters were elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives.&lt;ref name="nationaljournal"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/for-some-ron-paul-backers-a-new-motto-go-east-young-man-and-woman--20110510 | title=For Some Ron Paul Backers, a New Motto: Go East, Young Man (and Woman) | publisher=NationalJournal.com | date=May 10, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ArZQc604?url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/for-some-ron-paul-backers-a-new-motto-go-east-young-man-and-woman--20110510 | archivedate=September 22, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2012, Free Stater and self-described anarchist [[Tim O'Flaherty]] was elected to the state House of Representatives under the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] ticket, representing Manchester Ward 5.&lt;ref name=Hayward&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.unionleader.com/article/20121115/LOCALVOICES08/121119494 |date=November 14, 2012 |title=Anarchy in Ward 5?

==Responses==
On February 17, 2006, economist [[Walter Block]] publicly expressed his support for the FSP and is quoted as saying:
{{Cquote|You people are doing the Lord's work. The FSP is one of the freshest practical ideas for promoting liberty that has come out of the libertarian movement in the past few decades. May you succeed beyond your wildest dreams, and thus demonstrate in yet another empirical way the benefits and blessings of liberty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freestateproject.org/about/endorsements#block Walter Block's endorsement of the Free State Project]. ''FreeStateProject.org.'' 17 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Jeffrey Tucker]] reflected about his experiences at the [[New Hampshire Liberty Forum]] in [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]], saying in part: "If you are willing to look past mainstream media coverage of American politics, you can actually find exciting and interesting activities taking place that rise above lobbying, voting, graft and corruption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Political Migration in Our Time |url=http://freestateproject.org/content/political-migration-our-time |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310194902/http://freestateproject.org/content/political-migration-our-time |archivedate=March 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project has been endorsed by [[Ron Paul]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ron Paul Supports the Free State Project |url=http://freestateproject.org/intro/ron_paul |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519122424/http://freestateproject.org/intro/ron_paul |archivedate=May 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gary Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gary Johnson Endorses the FSP|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzLw12pbIU4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Lew Rockwell]] from the [[Mises Institute]] endorsed the project and referred to the city of [[Keene, New Hampshire]] as "The northern capital of libertarianism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lew Rockwell Applauds the Free State Project|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md6zzipKNVE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Peter Schiff]] said he had considered moving at one point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Schiff (Euro Pacific Capital Inc.)  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6BmdaZK3Zg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argue that the Free State Project is "radical",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2011/04/13/174973/new-hampshire-radical-right/?mobile=nc| title=The Radical-Right Free State Project Has Chosen New Hampshire For A Revolution| publisher=Thinkprogress.org| date=April 13, 2011| accessdate=September 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "fantasy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rationalreview.com/rationalreviewold/archive/stevetrinward/stevetrinward011203.html| title=The Free State Project: good idea or libertopian fantasy?| author=Steve Trinward| publisher=Rational Review| accessdate=September 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that they "go too far" in seeking to restrict government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://thecontributor.com/lte-free-staters-go-too-far| title=LTE: Free Staters go too far| publisher=Concord Monitor| date=June 28, 2012| accessdate=June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Canada}}
The '''Great Coalition''' was a [[grand coalition]] of political parties that brought the two Canadas together ([[Canada East]] and [[Canada West]]) in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;http://biographi.ca/en/theme_conferences_1864.html?p=5&lt;/ref&gt; The previous collapse after only three months of a coalition government formed by [[George-Étienne Cartier]] and [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] [[John A. Macdonald]] and liberal George Brown, (the sixth government in six years) had demonstrated that continued governance of Canada East and Canada West under the 1840 [[Act of Union (1840)|Act of Union]] had become untenable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/confederation/023001-3010.26-e.html|title=The Great Coalition|last=Cornell|first=Paul|date=1967|website=Library and Archives Canada|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reform the political system, a coalition was formed between the [[Clear Grits]] under [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], the [[Parti bleu]] under George-Étienne Cartier, and the Liberal-Conservatives under John A. Macdonald.  The formation of this coalition took place between June 14 and June 30, 1864 and was officially completed on June 22, 1864&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Great Coalition|last=Cornell|first=Paul G.|publisher=The Canadian Historical Association|year=1971|isbn=0-88798-049-X|location=Ottawa|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; under George-Étienne Cartier and John A. Macdonald, as the colonies of the Canadas, and was significant to [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867. The coalition persisted by the government of the Province of Canada until the moment of Confederation.

The Great Coalition was created to eradicate the political deadlock between Canada West and Canada East. The government at that time was unable to pass any legislation because of the need for a [[double majority]]. In order for a bill to pass in the [[Legislative Assembly]], there had to be a vote in both Canada East and Canada West sections of the assembly. As the French and the English could never agree on anything, this caused political deadlock. This coalition was intended to create resolution with long-term impacts in solving some of these problems and unify Canada.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The deadlock led to three conferences that preceded confederation. The first was the [[Charlottetown Conference]], which was convened for the purpose of negotiating a Maritime union. However, the politicians began to discuss the possibility of a larger union that would include all of [[British North America]]. This continued at the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]] where they further discussed the union of British North America and defined the details of the government's shape. They also settled on the division of provincial and federal responsibilities. The [[London Conference of 1866|London Conference]] revised the [[Quebec Resolutions]].

[[Image:Haw color.jpg|right|250px]]
'''Historians Against the War''' is a network of history teachers, scholars, and activists seeking to bring historical analysis to bear on U.S. foreign policy and its social/political impact.

==HAW Statements==
HAW has issued several statements on which membership in the organization has been based.

===Founding statement===
Historians Against the War (HAW) was founded in [[Chicago, Illinois]] at the 2003 Annual Meeting of the [[American Historical Association]].  A group of [[historians]] drafted the following statement which 2209 people subsequently signed:

{{quote|We historians call for a halt to the march towards war against Iraq. We are deeply concerned about the needless destruction of human life, the undermining of constitutional government in the U.S., the egregious curtailment of civil liberties and human rights at home and abroad, and the obstruction of world peace for the indefinite future.[http://www.historiansagainstwar.org/press03jan03.html]}}

===2003 U.S. Occupation of Iraq===
After the start of the 2003 [[Iraq War]], HAW drafted a new Statement on the U.S. Occupation of Iraq:

{{quote|historians, teachers, and scholars, we oppose the expansion of United States empire and the doctrine of pre-emptive war that have led to the occupation of Iraq. We deplore the secrecy, deception, and distortion of history involved in the administration's conduct of a war that violates international law, intensifies attacks on civil liberties, and reaches toward domination of the Middle East and its resources. Believing that both the Iraqi people and the American people have the right to determine their own political and economic futures (with appropriate outside assistance), we call for the restoration of cherished freedoms in the United States and for an end to the U.S. occupation of Iraq.[http://www.historiansagainstwar.org/press21sept03.html]}}

===2006 statement on Israel/Palestine/Lebanon fighting===
HAW's Steering Committee issued this statement on July 27, 2006 on the Israel/Palestine/Lebanon fighting.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

[http://www.historiansagainstwar.org/resources/hawnewsletter5.html] was published in September 2006, summarizing the discussion and including a sampling of the responses.

===2009 revised mission statement===
In the spring of 2009, the steering committee of HAW drafted a new mission statement and put it to the vote of the signatories of the original statement. It passed with overwhelming support.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Organizational structure==
HAW is led by a 20-member steering committee elected by the membership every January. The steering committee is allowed by its rules to invite additional members. The steering committee is headed by two co-chairs (currently Jim O'Brien of the University of Massachusetts Boston and [[Marc Becker]] of Truman State University). The steering committee forms ad hoc working groups as needed to organize events, draft statements and do other work.

Currently, voting membership is defined as encompassing all those who have signed the 2009 HAW mission statement.

==HAW conferences==
HAW has held two national conferences [http://www.historiansagainstwar.org/hawconf/], the first in 2006 and the second in 2008.

===Empire, Resistance, and the War in Iraq (2006)===
The first HAW conference "Empire, Resistance, and the War in Iraq: A Conference for Historians and Activists" was held at the University of Texas, Austin, February 17–19, 2006. This was the first scholarly conference in the U.S. to examine the origins of and opposition to the war in Iraq in historical perspective. It featured a plenary session with [[Howard Zinn]].

===War and Its Discontents (2008)===
The HAW's second conference "War and Its Discontents: Understanding Iraq and the U.S. Empire" was held at Georgia State University in Atlanta in April 11–13, 2008. It was co-sponsored by the [[Peace History Society]]. About 150 people came for the conference, and about 200 additional people to the Friday evening keynote plenary featuring Bill Fletcher Jr. and Naomi Klein.  In addition to four plenary sessions, 21 panels and workshops were held in four time slots on Saturday and Sunday.  Presenters included people from 46 different colleges and universities as well as several high schools and non-academic activists.

==Publications==
HAW's first publication was Stuart Schaar and Marvin E. Gettleman, ''Annotated Bibliography of English-Language Sources and Studies on The Middle East and Muslim South West Asia'', subsequently revised Spring 2007&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historiansagainstwar.org/resources/mideastbiblio4-3-07.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, HAW member Margaret Power produced ''Torture American Style'' [http://www.historiansagainstwar.org/resources/torture/].

In June 2006, HAW member Carl Mirra edited ''Join Us? Testimonies of Iraq War Veterans and Their Families'' for HAW's Oral History Working Group [http://www.historiansagainstwar.org/resources/oralhistory.pdf]. A shortened on-line version was carried in Artvoice, an alternative weekly in Buffalo, NY. Mirra also put together ''Conducting Oral History with Iraq War Veterans and Their Families: A Brief Guide'' for the Oral History Working Group [http://www.historiansagainstwar.org/resources/oralhistoryguide.pdf].

Alan Dawley wrote ''Why Peace Movements Are Important'' for the History News Network in March 2006 [http://hnn.us/articles/22749.html].

HAW also published ''The Bush - Cheney Years'', A Historians Against the War Roundtable at the American Historical Association Annual Meeting, January 3, 2009, New York, NY, with contributions by Alice Kessler - Harris (Columbia University), David Montgomery (Yale University), Vijay Prashad (Trinity College), Ellen Schrecker (Yeshiva University), Barbara Weinstein (New York University) [http://www.historiansagainstwar.org/resources/bush-cheney.pdf].

HAW also issued an occasional electronic Newsletter. One in October 2005, edited by Jeri Fogel, consisting of documents and reflections on HAW members' participation in the September 24, 2005 antiwar demonstration in Washington; and one in January 2006, edited by Alan Dawley, consisting of reports on HAW's participation in the AHA convention in Philadelphia. In September 2006, the name of the electronic newsletter was changed to HAW Notes.

==Teach-ins==
HAW stimulated dozens of campus teach-ins, forums, and other events on campus related to the Iraq War [http://www.historiansagainstwar.org/teachin/].  In the fall of 2006 over forty campuses held educational events or teach ins to educate students and faculty about the war and what they could do to oppose it. Part of the organizing effort was to compile and post a list of about sixty experts on the war, on US foreign policy, and on the antiwar movement who were willing to speak at campus events.

HAW co-sponsored with War Times a September 19, 2008 teach-in on the Iraq War in Berkeley, as part of a week of Bay Area events marking the 40th anniversary of 1968 and its social movements worldwide.

==HAW's involvement with United for Peace and Justice==
HAW was a member of [[United for Peace and Justice]] (UFPJ) since its founding in early 2003, only a few months after UFPJ was founded. Van Gosse and Andor Skotnes attended the first UFPJ National Assembly in June 2003 in Chicago, where Van Gosse was elected to the UFPJ Steering Committee to represent HAW. On the Steering Committee, HAW functioned as the de facto representative of the academic sector.  HAW mobilized its members and marched as a contingent in major UFPJ demonstrations.  UFPJ publicized HAW's first major publication, the Torture pamphlet. Van Gosse and  Rusti Eisenberg were very involved in setting up the Legislative Working Group of UFPJ in spring-summer of 2005, one of its most successful initiatives.

HAW organized a small contingent for the Washington demonstration called by United for Peace and Justice on January 27, 2007.  About forty people either marched in the contingent or gathered with HAW at a meeting place across the street from the mall.  The large Historians Against the War banner got a lot of notice from bystanders and other march participants.

==HAWblog==
HAW runs a blog at http://blog.historiansagainstwar.org/. The blog became a focus of controversy in libertarian and conservative circles when in the process of discussing a 2009 change to the mission statement two members [[David T. Beito]] and [[Thaddeus Russell]] used the blog to denounce the mission statement [http://www.historiansagainstwar.org/blog/2009/03/haw-info-draft-of-haw-statement.html]. Rather than posting their objection in the comments section as other members were doing, they posted their complaints as a new posts at the top of the blog. When HAW web editor [[Marc Becker]] moved their post to the comments section, they reposted it again at the top of the blog. Fearing an attempt to subvert the organization's attempt to discuss a new mission statement, HAW's steering committee decided to remove their privilege of creating new posts. Beito and Russell contended that this move was ideologically motivated. Charging that the steering committee intended to maintain HAW as a closed "leftist social club," Beito and Russell both resigned from HAW [http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/121872.html].

==HAW at the AHA==
HAW has a regular presence at the annual meetings of the [[American Historical Association]] (AHA).

===2006===
At the 2006 AHA annual meeting in Philadelphia, HAW voted to join the "Urgent Appeal to Save Iraq's Academics" [http://wwwbrusselstribunal.org] that publicized the indiscriminate killing that has taken the lives of 250 Iraqi colleagues as well as the United Nations University report that 84 percent of Iraq's institutions of higher education have already been burnt, looted or destroyed. HAW also debated resolutions scheduled for the AHA Business Meeting opposing the "so-called" academic bill of rights.  HAW played the lead role in this effort, initiating discussion, delegated drafting the text to Ellen Schrecker, and gathered almost one hundred co-sponsors.  The "Resolution opposing Academic and Student Bills of Rights and Similar Regulations of the Academic Community," was approved by HAW, the AHA Business Meeting and received unanimous approval from the American Historical Association Council.  HAW also sponsored two breakfasts and an evening social.

HAW also sponsored a well attended roundtable on "Historical Perspectives on Bush's Foreign Policy."  Alan Dawley chaired the session and discussion which produced vibrant and vital debate and discussion on the central question of how U.S. foreign policy can be changed after elites run the country into a war. The speakers were John Prados, "How We Were Hoodwinked on Iraq," Rusti Eisenberg, "Historical Lessons from the Vietnam Era," and Larry Wittner, "The Role of Peace Movements in Ending Wars."

John Prados talked about splits in ruling circles as a factor in undoing the policy of war.  In his opening comment, he showed how the Bush inner circle was so fixated on going to war with Iraq that it did not request CIA intelligence for fear that it might upset the applecart by showing there were no weapons of mass destruction.

To Rusti Eisenberg, on the other hand, there was no point in looking to the "National Security/Welfare State" for a change of course. Having learned virtually nothing from the Vietnam experience, the Bush circle is almost as irrational as the Nixon-Kissinger team in pursuing a policy that is doomed to fail, though not before slaughtering countless innocents. The only hope for change is a mass movement that will pressure elected representatives to change course, just as Congress cut off funding for Vietnam. For those wanting to believe that the peace movement can effect policy change, Larry Wittner offered some hopeful evidence. In an insightful review of the role of peace movements in ending U.S. wars from 1812 to Vietnam, he argued that even warmongers like Reagan had to change course in response to the worldwide movement against nuclear weapons. Having been invited to comment, Bruno Cartosio (editor of the Italian U.S-studies journal ''Acoma'') affirmed the importance of social movement in mobilizing opposition in Italy even before the Iraq war began.

In numerous exchanges between audience and panelists, analysis of the way to end war was deepened, often in reference to the anti-war movement of the Vietnam era. One important issue that emerged in discussion was that of "linkage" among movements. Where some felt strength lay in a single-issue focus on war, others felt worldwide opposition to the anticipated Iraq war was as strong as it was because it grew out of the post-Seattle [[anti-globalization movement]]. This raised the question of whether the ultimate causes of war lay in the needs of capitalist expansion, the imperatives of the National Security State, the tribalism of US v. Them, or some other cause.

===2007===
The AHA's annual business meeting, January 6, 2007, voted overwhelmingly in favor of the HAW-initiated resolution deploring the Iraq War's effect on open inquiry and democratic processes and calling on historians "to do whatever they can to bring the Iraq war to a speedy conclusion."  The AHA Council referred the resolution to the membership via an electronic ballot and set up a blog for members to post comments prior to the voting.  The results, announced on March 12, showed that about 2,000 AHA members had voted, and that slightly over three-quarters had voted in favor of the resolution.  This is the first time that the AHA has taken a position against any US-led war.

===2008===
At the January 2008 AHA convention in Washington, DC, HAW sponsored a panel on military resistance which included Carl Mirra and Margaret Power.

===2009===
At the January 2009 AHA convention HAW sponsored a panel discussion on "The Bush-Cheney Legacy."  Van Gosse and Margaret Power organized the panel and chaired the session.  The panelists were Alice Kessler-Harris, David Montgomery, Vijay Prashad, Ellen Schrecker, and Barbara Weinstein.   HAW also co-sponsored a small reception held by the Peace History Society.

===2011===
At the January 2011 AHA meeting in Boston, HAW members spoke panels focused on "The Public Uses of History and the Global War on Terror" &lt;ref&gt;http://aha.confex.com/aha/2011/webprogram/Session5212.html&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Global War on Terror: Historical Perspectives and Future Prospects." &lt;ref&gt;http://aha.confex.com/aha/2011/webprogram/Session3987.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other academic conferences===
In September 2007, Several SC members (Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, Margaret Power, Enrique Ochoa, and Walter Hixson) took part in a HAW-organized panel at the [[Latin American Studies Association]] (LASA) annual conference in Montreal.  The topic was "U.S. Imperialist Policies in Latin America and the Middle East."  Greg Grandin, Rula Abisaab, and Malek Abisaab also took part in the panel.

HAW also has had a frequent presence at the meetings of the [[Organization of American Historians]] (OAH) and the [[Left Forum]] in New York.

'''International arbitration''' is [[arbitration]] between companies or individuals in different [[Sovereign state|states]], usually by including a provision for future disputes in a contract.&lt;ref&gt;Gary B. Born, International Commercial Arbitration, 187, 197, 217 (2009); Julian M. Lew, Loukas A. Mistelis &amp; Stefan M. Kröll, Comparative International Commercial Arbitration 1-10 to 1-11, 6-1 to 6-6 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominant system of rules is the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, as well as the  [[United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards]] of 1958 (the "New York Convention").&lt;ref&gt;Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 1958 (the “New York Convention”), June 10, 1958, http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/NYConvention.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID) also handles arbitration, but it is particularly focused on [[investor-state dispute settlement]] and hears relatively few cases.

The New York Convention was drafted under the auspices of the United Nations and has been ratified by more than 150 countries, including most major countries involved in significant international trade and economic transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Fry, Recognition And Enforcement Of Foreign Arbitral Awards: A Global Commentary On The New York Convention Foreword (Herbert Kronke, Patricia Nacimiento, Dirk Otto &amp; Nicola Christine Port eds., 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Convention requires the states that have ratified it to recognize and enforce international arbitration agreements and foreign arbitral awards issued in other contracting states, subject to certain limited exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;New York Convention, arts. II, III &amp; V, June 10, 1958, http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/NYConvention.html; Fouchard Gaillard Goldman On International Commercial Arbitration ¶¶ 250-252 (Emmanuel Gaillard &amp; John Savage eds., 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; These provisions of the New York Convention, together with the large number of contracting states, have created an international legal regime that significantly favors the enforcement of international arbitration agreements and awards.&lt;ref&gt;Gary B. Born, International Arbitration and Forum Selection Agreements: Drafting and Enforcing 10-11, 123-124 (3rd ed. 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; It was preceded by the 1927 [[Convention on the Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards]] in Geneva.

== Features ==
International arbitration allows the parties to avoid local court procedures. International arbitration has different rules than domestic arbitration,&lt;ref&gt;Yves Dezalay &amp; Bryant G. Garth, Dealing In Virtue: International Commercial Arbitration And The Construction Of A Transnational Legal Order 9-10, 124, 198 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and has its own non-country-specific standards of ethical conduct.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibanet.org/images/downloads/guidelines%20text.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  

The process may be more limited than typical litigation and forms a hybrid between the common law and civil law legal systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sachs|first=Klaus|title=CMS Guide to Arbitration: Foreword|url=http://eguides.cmslegal.com/arbitration#|publisher=CMS Legal|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[International Bar Association]] (IBA)'s Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Commercial Arbitration, revised in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibanet.org/images/downloads/IBA%20rules%20on%20the%20taking%20of%20Evidence.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; do not  adopt common law broad disclosure procedures (discovery) or follow the civil law in eliminating entirely the ability of engaging in some disclosure-related practices. The IBA Rules blend common and civil systems so that parties may narrowly tailor disclosure to the agreement's particular subject matter. 

David Rivkin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.debevoise.com/attorneys/detail.aspx?id=51f057f6-8110-4477-a41b-59e72f9138b5]&lt;/ref&gt; who chaired the committee that drafted the rules, has noted that the wide adoption of these rules in international arbitration has led in practice to an unexpected use by common law practitioners to limit disclosure and by civil law practitioners to expand it. 

The rules can be further impacted by [http://eguides.cmslegal.com/arbitrationreferences arbitral rules] that may be agreed between the parties.

=== Global enforcement ===
Most countries, especially in the developed world, are signatories of the New York Convention. Consequently, judgements can be enforced across the world. The New York Convention, more formally known as the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, provides for court recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitration decisions, allowing arbitration proceedings to piggyback on the authority of domestic jurisdictions across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Druzin|first=Bryan|title=Anarchy, Order, and Trade: A structuralist Account of why a global Commercial Legal Order is emerging|url=https://works.bepress.com/bryan_druzin/12/|journal=Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law|volume=47|page=1057}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast, there is no equivalent treaty for the international recognition of court decisions with a large membership although the [[Hague Convention of 30 June 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements]] entered into force in 2015 for the European Union and Mexico. Similarly, no equivalent treaty exists so far for the international recognition of settlements achieved in [[mediation]] or [[conciliation]]:so far, a meeting of the [[UNCITRAL]] Working Group II in New York has taken place in February 2015 subsequent to a US proposal for that working group to develop a convention on the enforcement of conciliated settlement agreements for international commercial disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Lorraine Brennan: [http://www.mediate.com/articles/BrennanLbl20150227.cfm Do We Need a New York Convention for Mediation/Conciliation?], Mediate.com, February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Within the EU, the enforceability of mediation agreements is ruled by Directive 2008/52/EC.

=== Protection from lawsuits ===
Under the New York Convention, if a party to arbitration files a lawsuit in breach of an arbitration agreement, the court is obligated to stay the proceedings. Chapter 2 of the [[Federal Arbitration Act]] sets forth the statutory basis for an American court to issue a stay in connection with contracts falling within the ambit of the New York Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to Arbitration in New York|url=http://eguides.cmslegal.com/pdf/arbitration_volume_I/CMS%20GtA_Vol%20I_NEW%20YORK.pdf|publisher=CMS Legal|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
But it is important to adopt one organization related to arbitration.

=== Appeals ===
Under the New York Convention, Article V provides for seven reasons that a court can use to refuse to enforce an arbitration judgment .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/bjil/vol3/iss2/2/|title="Enforcement of Arbitral Awards under the New York Convention - Practic" by Joseph T. McLaughlin and Laurie Genevro|website=scholarship.law.berkeley.edu|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cases and statistics ==
Public information on overall and specific arbitration cases is quite limited as there is no need to involve the courts at all unless there is a dispute, and in most cases the loser pays voluntarily.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Argen|first=Robert|date=2015-01-01|title=Ending Blind Spot Justice: Broadening the Transparency Trend in International Arbitration|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network|ssrn=2393188}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, a review of disputed cases in China found that from 2000 to 2011, in 17 cases the Supreme People's Court upheld the refusal to enforce the arbitration agreement due to a provision in Article V; China has an automatic appeal system to the highest court, so this includes all such refusals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/ab/vol1/iss1/10/|title="Implementation of the New York Convention in China" by Xiaohong Xia|website=digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agreement details==

A number of essential elements should be included in almost all international arbitration agreements, with model language available.&lt;ref&gt;IBA Guidelines for Drafting International Arbitration Clauses, http://www.ibanet.org/LPD/Dispute_Resolution_Section/Arbitration/Default.aspx; Gary B. Born, International Arbitration And Forum Selection Agreements: Drafting And Enforcing (3d ed. 2010); Paul D. Friedland, Arbitration Clauses For International Contracts (2nd ed. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; These include the agreement to arbitrate, a definition of the scope of disputes subject to arbitration, the means for selecting the arbitrator(s), a choice of the arbitral seat, and the adoption of institutional or ad hoc arbitration rules.&lt;ref&gt;G. Born, International Arbitration And Forum Selection Agreements: Drafting And Enforcing 38 (3d ed. 2010); Paul D. Friedland, Clauses For International Contracts 61-69 (2nd ed. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of other provisions can also be included in international arbitration clauses, including the language for the conduct of the arbitration, choice of applicable law, arbitrator qualifications, interim relief, costs, and procedural matters.

In order to bridge the gap when parties to an international agreement have difficulty in agreeing upon an arbitral institution, some international arbitration specialists recommend using an arbitration clause that authorizes two arbitral institutions in the same city. Those clauses generally empower the party ''commencing'' the arbitration to select the arbitral institution.&lt;ref&gt;See Eric Sherby, “''A Different Type of International Arbitration Clause'',” ''Int’l Law News'' (American Bar Association) Winter 2005 at 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

A mnemonic device, “BLINC LLC”,  reflects some of the most important clauses: broad, law, institutional, number, costs, location, language, and carve-out.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.abanet.org/buslaw/blt/content/articles/2010/09/0001.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arbitration organizations ==
Several major international institutions and rule making bodies set out rules and appoint arbitrators.

Other Important Institutions for Arbitration in North America are [http://www.jamsinternational.com/ JAMS International], the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre (BCICAC, Canada).

Specialist ADR bodies also exist, such as the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), which has an arbitration and mediation center and a panel of international neutrals specialising in intellectual property and technology related disputes. [http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/] 

A number of arbitral institutions have adopted the UNCITRAL Rules for use in international cases. See for example, Australia's adoption of the UNCITRAL Rules in its 6 July 2010 amendment to the 'International Arbitration Act 1974' (Cth).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AUIntLawJl/2012/10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaa1974276/&lt;/ref&gt;

The most salient feature of the rules of the ICC is its use of the "terms of reference." The "terms of reference" is a summary of the claims and issues in dispute and the particulars of the procedure and is prepared by the tribunal and signed by the parties near the beginning of the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barin |first1=Babak |last2=Little|first2=Andrew |last3=Pepper|first3=Randy  |date=2006 |title=The Osler Guide to Commercial Arbitration in Canada |url= |location=The Netherlands |publisher=Kluwer Law International |page=34 |isbn=90-411-2428-4 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more recent development, the Swiss Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Basel, Berne, Geneva, Lausanne, Lugano, Neuchâtel and Zurich have adopted a new set of Swiss Rules of Commercial Mediation that are designed to integrate fully with the Swiss Rules of International Arbitration that were previously adopted by these chambers to harmonize international arbitration and mediation proceedings across Switzerland.[http://www.altenburger.ch/uploads/tx_altenburger/jl_2008_Swiss_Rules_Commercial_Mediation.pdf]

== Research and other organizations ==
The International Arbitration Institute, headed by [[Emmanuel Gaillard]], was created in 2001, under the auspices of the Comité français de l’arbitrage (CFA), to promote exchanges and transparency in the international commercial arbitration community.

The Association for International Arbitration is a non-profit organisation founded in Paris in 2001 by Johan Billiet which provides information, training and educational activities but does not appoint arbitrators.

== International investment and ICSID ==
{{Main article|International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes }}

The [[International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID) is an ad hoc tribunal established pursuant to UNCITRAL Rules to arbitrate [[International Investment Agreement]]s and provide foreign investors with a means for redress against states for breaches of contract. The ICSID was designed so that it cannot be reviewed by domestic courts which in theory makes it more enforceable.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/8774773/State_Immunity_from_Execution_in_the_Collection_of_Awards_Rendered_in_International_Investment_Arbitration_the_Achilles_Heel_of_the_Investor_State_Arbitration_System|title=State Immunity from Execution in the Collection of Awards Rendered in International Investment Arbitration: the Achilles’ Heel of the Investor – State Arbitration System?|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, state immunity to lawsuits and judgments poses a barrier to collection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The legal protection of [[Foreign Direct Investment|foreign direct investment]] is guaranteed by a network of more than 2750 [[Bilateral Investment Treaty|Bilateral Investment Treaties]] (BITs), Multilateral Investment Treaties, most notably the [[Energy Charter Treaty]] and a number of free trade agreements containing chapter on investment protection through [[investor-state dispute settlement]], such as [[NAFTA]]. The overall number of cases concluded reached 244. Of them, approximately 42% were decided in favour of the state and approximately 31% in favour of the investor. Approximately 27% of the cases were settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/webdiaepcb2013d3_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interstate arbitration ==

Arbitration has been used for centuries, including in antiquity, for the resolution of disputes between states and state-like entities.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson H. Ralston, International Arbitration From Athens To Locarno 153-154; John L. Simpson &amp; Hazel Fox, International Arbitration:  Law And Practice 1 (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of relative disuse, [[Jay's Treaty]] between the United States and Great Britain revived international arbitration as a means of resolving interstate disputes. The 1899 and 1907 Hague Conferences addressed arbitration as a mechanism for resolving state-to-state disputes, leading to the adoption of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes]].  The Conventions established the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] and a rudimentary institutional framework for international arbitration of interstate disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Shabtai Rosenne, The Hague Peace Conferences Of 1899 And 1907 and International Arbitration: Reports and Documents xxi (2001); Alan Redfern, Martin H.

He is a [[University Professor (Columbia)|University Professor]] of economics and law at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.columbia.edu/media_inquiries/news_events/2010/November2010/Bhagwati-Trade-Panel|title=Professor Jagdish Bhagwati Called Upon by World Leaders to Find Ways to Boost Global Trade|publisher=Law.columbia.edu|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhagwati is notable for his research in international trade and for his advocacy of [[free trade]].

==Early years and personal life==
Bhagwati was born in 1934, into a [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] family in the Bombay Presidency during the British Raj, and received a BA from [[Sydenham College]], [[Mumbai]]. He then traveled to England to study at [[St. John's College, Cambridge]], receiving a second BA at Cambridge (in Economics) in 1956. Between 1957 and 1959 he studied at [[Nuffield College, Oxford]].  He received the [[Ph.D.]] in Economics from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1961 for a thesis titled "Essays in International Economics", supervised by [[Charles P. Kindleberger]].

Bhagwati is married to [[Padma Desai]], also a Columbia economist and Russia-specialist; they have one daughter. He is the brother of [[Prafullachandra Natwarlal Bhagwati|P.N. Bhagwati]], former [[Chief Justice of India]] and also of S.N. Bhagwati, an eminent neurosurgeon.  Bhagwati and Desai's joint 1970 OECD study ''India: Planning for Industrialization'' was a notable contribution at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freemarketmojo.com/?p=9867]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122064824/http://freemarketmojo.com/?p=9867|date=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After completing his PhD, Bhagwati returned to India in 1961, first to teach briefly at the [[Indian Statistical Institute]], Kolkata, and then as professor of international trade at the [[Delhi School of Economics]] at the [[University of Delhi]], from 1962 to 1968. From 1968 until 1980, Bhagwati was an economics professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/bio.php?id=1753]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803094910/http://www.cfr.org/bio.php?id=1753|date=August 3, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhagwati currently serves on the Academic Advisory Board of [[Human Rights Watch]] (Asia) and on the board of scholars of the [[Centre for Civil Society]].  He is a Senior Fellow of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]]. Bhagwati has previously served as an external advisor to the Director General of the [[World Trade Organization]] in 2001, as a special policy advisor on globalization to the [[United Nations]] in 2000, and as an economics policy advisor to the Director-General of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]], from 1991 to 1993.

In 2000, Bhagwati was signatory to an amicus briefing, coordinated by the [[American Enterprise Institute]], with the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] to contend that the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] should, contrary to a prior ruling, be allowed to take into account the costs of regulations when setting environmental standards.

In January 2004, Bhagwati published ''In Defense of Globalization,'' a book in which he argues: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;... this process [of globalization] has a human face, but we need to make that face more agreeable.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In May, 2004, Bhagwati was one of the experts who took part in the [[Copenhagen Consensus]] project.

In 2006, Bhagwati was a member of the Panel of Eminent Persons who reviewed the work of the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD). In early 2010, Bhagwati joined the advisory board of the Institute for Migrant Rights, Cianjur – Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imr.or.id|title=The Institute for Migrant Rights|work=The Institute for Migrant Rights|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, he is professor of economics and law at [[Columbia University]].

[[Paul Samuelson]], on the occasion of Bhagwati's 70th birthday ''[[festschrift]]'' conference in Gainesville, Florida on January 2005 said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I measure a scholar's prolific-ness not by the mere number of his publishings. Just as the area of a rectangle equals its width times its depth, the quality of a lifetime accomplishment must weight each article by its novelties and wisdoms. ... Jagdish Bhagwati is more like [[Haydn]]: a composer of more than a hundred symphonies and no one of them other than top notch. ... In the struggle to improve the lot of mankind, whether located in advanced economies or in societies climbing the ladder out of poverty, Jagdish Bhagwati has been a tireless partisan of that globalization which elevates global total-factor – productivities both of richest America and poorest regions of Asia and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~jb38/Festschrift%20Samuelson.pdf|format=PDF|title=Jagdish Bhagwati, the wunderkind who became the tireless theorist of international trade|author=Paul A.

From April 1948 to May 1949, the Korean province of [[Jeju Island]] was subjected to a communist [[insurgency]] and subsequent [[anticommunist]] suppression campaign, during which between 14,000 and 30,000 people were killed.&lt;ref name="Hugh Deane 1999 54-58"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh Deane|title=The Korean War, 1945–1953|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=32Vy2Fj4KFUC|year=1999|publisher=China Books&amp;Periodicals, Inc|pages=54–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Cheju-do Rebellion|last = Merrill|first = John|date = 1980|journal = The Journal of Korean Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 139–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|139, 193}} The proximate cause of the rebellion was the scheduling of elections for May 10, 1948, by the [[UNTCOK|United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea]] (UNTCOK) in the hope of creating a new government for all of Korea.

==Background==

===Political situation in Korea===
After [[Imperial Japan]] surrendered to [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces on August 15, 1945, the 35-year [[Japanese occupation of Korea]] finally came to an end. Korea was subsequently divided at the [[38th parallel north]], with the Soviet Union assuming trusteeship north of the line and the United States south of the line. In September 1945, Lt. General [[John R. Hodge]] established a military government to administer the southern region, which included Jeju Island.  In December 1945, U.S. representatives met with those from the Soviet Union and United Kingdom to work out joint trusteeship. Due to lack of consensus, however, the U.S. took the "Korean question" to the [[United Nations]] for further deliberation. On November 14, 1947, the United Nations General Assembly passed UN Resolution 112, calling for a general election on May 10, 1948, under [[UNTCOK]] supervision.&lt;ref name="UN2"&gt;{{cite web |year = 2007|url = https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/2/ares2.htm|title = United Nations Resolution 112: The Problem of the Independence of Korea|publisher = [[United Nations]]|accessdate = March 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fearing it would lose influence over the northern half of Korea if it complied, the Soviet Union rejected the UN resolution and denied the UNTCOK access to northern Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Korea: The First War We Lost|last = Alexander|first = Bevin|publisher = Hippocrene|year = 1998|isbn = |location = New York|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNTCOK nevertheless went through with the elections, albeit in the southern half of the country only. The Soviet Union responded to these elections in the south with an election of its own in the north on August 25, 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = From Stalin to Kim Il Sung: The formation of North Korea, 1945–1960|last = Lanʹkov|first = A. N.|publisher = Rutgers University Press|year = 2002|isbn = 0813531179 |location = New Brunswick, New Jersey|page = 46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political situation on Jeju Island===
Residents of Jeju island were some of the most active participants in the [[Korean independence movement]] against colonial Japanese occupation. Due to the island's relative isolation from the mainland peninsula, Jeju experienced relative peace after the Japanese surrender, contrasting with the period of heavy unrest in the southern region of mainland Korea. As with the mainland, the period immediately following the Japanese surrender was characterized by the formation of [[People's Committee (postwar Korea)|People's Committees]], local, autonomous counsels tasked with coordinating the transition towards Korean independence. When the American military government arrived on Jeju in late 1945, the Jeju People's Council was the only existing government on the island. As a testament to this relative stability, the US military governor under the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]] (USAMGIK) [[John R. Hodge]] stated in  October 1947 that Jeju was "a truly communal area that is peacefully controlled by the People's Committee without much [[Communist International|Comintern]] influence."&lt;ref name="cum1"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Cumings   | first = Bruce |  chapter = The Question of American Responsibility for the Suppression of the Jejudo Uprising  | editor-first = Sang Soo  | editor-last = Hur  | title = For the Truth and Reparations: Jeju April 3rd of 1948 Massacre not Forgotten  | year = 2001   | publisher = BaekSan Publisher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jeju People's Council had come under the directive of the [[Workers' Party of South Korea|South Korean Labor Party]] (SKLP) by late 1946. The SKLP encouraged the People's Council to establish military and political committees, as well as mass organizations. The 1946 USAMGIK dissolution of the provisional [[People's Republic of Korea]] and their associated People's Committees on the mainland sparked the [[Autumn Uprising of 1946]], which did not spread to Jeju (as its PC still operated virtually unperturbed by the American military government) but did contribute to rising tensions on the island.&lt;ref name = "cum1" /&gt;{{rp|17–18}}

==Incidents leading up to the uprising==

=== Sam-Il demonstrations ===
Residents of Jeju began protesting against the elections a year before they took place. Particularly concerned about permanently dividing the peninsula, the SKLP planned gatherings on March 1, 1947 to denounce the elections and simultaneously celebrate the anniversary of the [[March 1st Movement]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|153}}&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{rp|28}} An attempt by the security forces to disperse the crowds only brought more citizens of Jeju out in support of the demonstrations. In a desperate attempt to calm the boisterous crowd, Korean police fired indiscriminate warning shots above their heads, some of which went into the crowd.  Although these shots successfully pacified the demonstrators, six civilians were killed, including a six-year-old child.{{efn|U.S. State Department analyst John Merrill originally reported that only one person was killed, a six-year old child. However, this conflicts with the official G-2 Periodic Report given by the 6th Infantry Division, the division responsible for firing on the protesters. The G-2 report states that 6 civilians were killed.}}&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|154}}&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{rp|28}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jeju43peace.or.kr/report_eng.pdf |title=The Jeju April 3 Incident Investigation Report |author=The National Committee for the Investigation of the Truth about the Jeju April 3 Incident |date=December 15, 2003 |publisher=Office of the Prime Minister, Republic of Korea |page= |access-date=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chong-myon jail incident ===
On March 8, 1947, a crowd of about a thousand demonstrators gathered at the Chong-myon jail, demanding the release of SKLP members the military government had arrested during the Sam-Il demonstrations. When the demonstrators started throwing rocks and subsequently rushed the jail, the police inside shot at them in a panic, killing five.  In response, SKLP members and others called on the military government to take action against the police officers who fired on the crowd. Instead, 400 more police officers were flown in from the mainland, along with members of an extreme right-wing paramilitary group known as the [[Northwest Youth League]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|154}} Although both the police and paramilitary groups employed violent and harsh tactics in their suppression of the locals, the Northwest Youth League was especially ruthless, described as borderline terroristic.&lt;ref name="Blowback" /&gt;{{rp|99}}&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|155}}&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|58}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.jejuweekly.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1435|title = The Northwest Youth League |publisher = Jeju Weekly | last = Flenniken | first = Lauren |date = April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== February 1948 general strike ===
As the May 10, 1948 elections approached, SKLP leaders hardened in their opposition to the involvement of UNTCOK in Korean affairs, as they believed the elections would concretize the 38th parallel partition as a border, rendering a unified, independent Korea much less likely. In January 1948, [[Pak Hon-yong]], the leader of the SKLP, called on SKLP members south of the 38th parallel to oppose the elections by whatever means necessary, and called for a general strike to begin on February 7. At this point, there were at least 60,000 members of the SKLP on Jeju, and at least 80,000 active supporters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These members and supporters not only went on strike but in some cases attacked government installations and engaged with police forces in open conflict. These engagements between SKLP guerrillas against rightist groups and police continued through March 1948.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|164}}

==Rebellion==

=== April 3, 1948 ===
Although skirmishes had been taking place on Jeju Island since early 1947, April 3, 1948 is considered as the day the Jeju uprising officially began.  Some sources claim it came about when military police "fired on a demonstration commemorating the Korean struggle against Japanese rule," igniting mass insurrection.&lt;ref name="Blowback" /&gt;{{rp|99}} Other sources, however, make no mention of this demonstration incident, and claim that SKLP plans to attack on April 3, 1948 had been in the works for some time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|166}}&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{rp|30}} Whatever the case, around 02:00 around 500 SKLP guerrillas alongside up to 3,000 sympathizers attacked Northwest Youth League positions as well as 11 of the 24 police stations on the island, killing 30 police officers, specifically targeting those who were known to have previously collaborated with the Japanese.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|167}}&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|55}}

Lieutenant General [[Kim Ik-ryeol]], commander of police forces on the island, attempted to end the insurrection peacefully by negotiating with the rebels. He met several times with rebel leader [[Kim Dal-sam]] of the SKLP but neither side could agree on conditions. The government wanted a complete surrender and the rebels demanded disarmament of the local police, dismissal of all governing officials on the island, prohibition of paramilitary groups, and the re-unification and liberation of the Korean peninsula.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|174}}&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the wake of these failed peace negotiations, the fighting continued. The U.S. military government responded to guerrilla activity by transferring another regiment to Jeju from [[Busan]] and deploying police companies, each 1,700 strong, from the southern provinces of the mainland.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|168}} The guerrillas retreated to their bases in the forests and caves around [[Hallasan]], an extinct volcano and the highest mountain in South Korea. On April 29, the Korean, non-military, governor of Jeju province abandoned his post, defected, and joined the guerrillas. This caused many police officers, disillusioned by the atrocities they were ordered to commit against their own, to do the same. In response, U.S. military provincial governor [[William F. Dean]] ordered a purge of SKLP sympathizers from the ranks of the Korean Constabulary, and three sergeants were summarily executed.&lt;ref name="m2"&gt;{{cite book | last = Merrill | first =John | year = 1989 | title = Korea: The Peninsular Origins of the War | publisher =University of Delaware Press | isbn =0-87413-300-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|68}}

Fighting continued through the May 10 elections.  During election week, the guerrillas "cut telephone lines, destroyed bridges, and blocked roads with piles of stones to disrupt communications."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|171}} The SKLP Women's League campaigned for residents to hide in the mountainous region controlled by guerillas the night before the election so they could not be brought out to vote at gunpoint, and thousands did. Many election officials even declined to show up. These campaigns, along with sporadic arson, violent demonstrations and attacks on three government installations on election day rendered the election useless. The turnout in Jeju was the lowest in all of South Korea, so low that the two seats reserved for Jeju province in the new national assembly were left vacant.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|171}}&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{rp|31}}

Fearing an  upsurge in guerrilla activities after they succeeded in getting what they wanted out of the election, General Dean requested a US Navy blockade of the island on May 11, so that sympathizers from the mainland could not reach Jeju. The Navy sent the [[USS John R. Craig (DD-885)]] to enforce the blockade.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|172}}

=== August 1948 underground elections and Yeosu rebellion ===
Although guerrilla activities waned during the summer months of 1948, they picked up again in August after the Soviet Union held elections north of the 38th parallel to form the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;{{rp|176,179}} In conjunction with these elections, the [[Workers' Party of North Korea]] organized "underground elections" for those wanting to participate south of the 38th parallel, including on Jeju Island.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;{{rp|177}} &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{rp|34}} Although the turnout of these elections is disputed,{{efn|U.S. intelligence estimated a voter turnout of 25%, while the DPRK reported a 77% turnout.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;{{rp|177}}}} they succeeded at emboldening SKLP military forces.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|177}}&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; In the months following the elections, conditions worsened to the point that Republic of Korea (ROK) officials decided to send the Fourteenth Regiment of the Korean Constabulatory, stationed near the southern port city of [[Yeosu]], to Jeju Island to assist counter-guerrilla efforts. Not wanting to "murder the people of Jeju," however, thousands of these troops mutinied on October 20, 1948, just as they were preparing to depart. They killed many of the high-ranking officers and former Japanese collaborators and seized Yeosu and surrounding areas before retreating into the areas around [[Jirisan]] mountain and setting up guerrilla bases, much as the Jeju guerrillas did while hiding out in [[Hallasan]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|179–80}}&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{rp|34}} Embarrassed by this incident, [[Syngman Rhee]], the newly elected president of the ROK, intensified the government's efforts to stamp out the rebellion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|182}}&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{rp|34}} On November 17, 1948, Syngman Rhee proclaimed martial law in order to quell the rebellion.&lt;ref name="jejuweekly20100331"/&gt; During this period, ROK police forces engaged in numerous war crimes. One report describes the events of December 14, 1948 at a small Jeju village, in which ROK forces attacked the village and kidnapped many young men and girls. The girls were gang-raped over a two-week period and were then executed along with the young men.&lt;ref name="newsweek3" /&gt;

By the end of 1948, the ROK's harsh tactics and effective suppression campaigns had reduced the number of guerrilla forces to just 300.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|184}}

=== SKLP's 1949 New Year offensive and the ROK's eradication campaign ===
On January 1, 1949, the guerrillas launched one last offensive against ROK police. They attacked at Odong-ni and Jeju City, but were beaten back by ROK police and driven to the island's interior mountains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|184–85}} ROK police pursued the guerrillas and continued to commit atrocities, including rounding up whole villages and killing them all.&lt;ref name="Blowback" /&gt;{{rp|58}}&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|186}}&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{rp|36}} The ROK forces, now determined to destroy the remaining SKLP guerrillas, launched an eradication campaign in March 1949. During the campaign, 2,345 guerrillas and 1,668 civilians were killed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|189}} With the campaign now effectively over, the ROK held elections on Jeju Island to fill the province's empty seats in the National Assembly; Jeju Island was now effectively and symbolically under ROK jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|192}}&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{rp|31}}

==United States involvement==

At the beginning of the uprising, the island was controlled by the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]]. Only a small number of Americans were present.&lt;ref name="Blowback"/&gt; [[Jimmie Leach]], then a captain in the U.S. Army, was an adviser to the South Korean Constabulary and claimed that there were six Americans on the island, including himself, and that they could call on two small [[Piper J-3#World War II service|L-4]] scout planes and two old minesweepers converted to coastal cutters, manned by Korean crews.&lt;ref name="beaufortgazette"&gt;{{cite web |date = January 10, 2006|url = http://dwb.beaufortgazette.com/local_news/military/story/5443010p-4914264c.html|title = Col.

Casteel to Jeju to investigate the causes of the rebellion. They summarized that February 1948 Jeju general strike prior to the rebellion was caused by instigation by the South Korean Labor Party and hostility towards the police as a result of shootings. They also described the strike as "communist inspired" but participated by both the left and right in response to the March 1 shootings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jeju43peace.or.kr/report_eng.pdf |title=The Jeju April 3 Incident Investigation Report |author=The National Committee for the Investigation of the Truth about the Jeju April 3 Incident |date=December 15, 2003 |publisher=Office of the Prime Minister, Republic of Korea |page=144 |access-date=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By spring of 1949 four South Korean Army battalions arrived and joined the local constabulary, police forces, and right-wing Northwest Youth Association partisans to brutally suppress protests. The combined forces quickly destroyed or disabled most of the remaining rebel forces. On August 17, 1949, the leadership of the movement fell apart following the killing of major rebel leader Yi Tuk-ku.&lt;ref name="Varhola"&gt;{{cite book |last = Michael J.

The National Committee for the Investigation of the Truth about the Jeju April 3 Incident concluded that the U.S. Army Military Government in Korea and the [[Korean Military Advisory Group]] shared responsibility for the incident as it occurred under the rule of the military government and an American colonel was in charge of the security forces of Jeju.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jeju43peace.or.kr/report_eng.pdf |title=The Jeju April 3 Incident Investigation Report |author=The National Committee for the Investigation of the Truth about the Jeju April 3 Incident |date=December 15, 2003 |publisher=Office of the Prime Minister, Republic of Korea |page=654 |access-date=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. military documented massacres but did not intervene.&lt;ref name="newsweek" /&gt; On May 13, 1949 the [[United States Ambassador to Korea|American ambassador to South Korea]] wired Washington that the Jeju rebels and their sympathizers had been, "killed, captured, or converted."&lt;ref name="Blowback"/&gt; ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' reported on the South Korean Army's brutal suppression of the rebellion, local support for the rebels, as well as rebel retaliation against local rightist opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sandler |first=Stanley |date=1999 |title=The Korean War: No Victors, No Vanquished |location=Padstow, Cornwall |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |page=38 |isbn=0-8131-2119-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==During the Korean War==

{{Main|Korean War}}

Immediately after the [[Korean War|North Korean invasion of South Korea]], the South Korean military ordered "preemptive apprehension" of suspected leftists nationwide. Thousands were detained on Jeju, then sorted into four groups, labeled A, B, C and D, based on the perceived security risks each posed. On August 30, 1950, a written order by a senior intelligence officer in the [[South Korean Navy]] instructed Jeju's police to ''"execute all those in groups C and D by firing squad no later than September 6."''&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite news |date=June 19, 2000|url = http://www.newsweek.com/id/85131|title = Ghosts Of Cheju|publisher = [[Newsweek]]| accessdate = March 30, 2009 | author=Hideko Takayama }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In one of its first official acts, the South Korean National Assembly passed the National Traitors Act in 1948, which among other measures, outlawed the [[Workers Party of South Korea]].&lt;ref name="Malkasian"&gt;{{cite book | last = Carter Malkasian| authorlink = | title = The Korean War (Essential Histories)|edition= September 25, 2001|page= 2222 | publisher = Osprey Publishing| isbn= 1-84176-282-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For almost fifty years after the uprising, it was a crime punishable by beatings, torture and a lengthy prison sentence if any South Korean even mentioned the events of the Jeju uprising.&lt;ref name="Blowback"/&gt;  The event had been largely ignored by the government.

In October 2003, President [[Roh Moo-hyun]] apologized to the populace of Jeju for the brutal suppression of the uprising, stating, "Due to wrongful decisions of the government, many innocent people of Jeju suffered many casualties and destruction of their homes."&lt;ref name="jejuweekly20100331"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.jejuweekly.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=657|title = Islanders still mourn April 3 massacre|publisher = Jeju Weekly|date = March 31, 2010|accessdate = May 5, 2013|first = Song|last = Jung Hee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roh was the first South Korean president to apologize for the 1948 massacre.&lt;ref name="jejuweekly20100331"/&gt; In March 2009, the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Korea)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] revealed that, "At least 20,000 people jailed for taking part in the popular uprisings in Jeju, Yeosu and Suncheon, or accused of being communists, were massacred in some 20 prisons across the country," when the Korean War broke out.&lt;ref name="jinsil"&gt;{{cite web|year = 2009|url = http://jinsil.go.kr/English/Information/notice/read.asp?num=343&amp;pageno=&amp;stype=&amp;sval=&amp;data_years=&amp;data_month=|title = Truth commission confirms civilian killings during war|publisher = Republic of Korea|accessdate = March 29, 2009|last = |quote = At least 20,000 people jailed for taking part in the popular uprisings in Jeju, Yeosu and Suncheon, or accused of being communists, were massacred in some 20 prisons across the country.|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110722140425/http://jinsil.go.kr/English/Information/notice/read.asp?num=343&amp;pageno=&amp;stype=&amp;sval=&amp;data_years=&amp;data_month=|archivedate = July 22, 2011|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===Effort of truth ascertainment===
Families of victims of the uprising and associated massacres, as well as various civic organizations, continuously attempted to openly discuss the uprising but the national government suppressed all materials and discussions, and even made the topic of the uprising illegal. The first published recollection in South Korea of the massacre was the 1978 novel ''Sun-i Samch'on'' ({{Korean|hangul=순이삼촌}}, "Uncle Suni") which is set during the event. However, it was swiftly banned by the ROK government and its author, [[Hyun Ki-young]], was arrested and tortured for three days by the [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|National Intelligence Service]].&lt;ref name="jejuweekly20121120"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.jejuweekly.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=28415|title = My dinner with Hyun Ki Young |publisher = Jeju Weekly | last = Coote | first = Darryl |date = November 20, 2012 | access-date = October 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jejuweekly20121025"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.jejuweekly.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=2813|title = 'Sun-i Samch'on' revisited for the first time |publisher = Jeju Weekly |date = October 25, 2012 | access-date = October 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on November 23, 1998, after the democratization of South Korea, former president [[Kim dae-jung]] stated that "the Jeju uprising was a communist rebellion, but there are a lot of people who died under false accusations as innocents, so now we have to reveal the truth and clear their false charges."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Ki-Sueng |title=한나라당 제주도지부, 김총장 발언 유감 표명 |url= http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0000028398 |work=The Yonhapnews}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 26, 1999, the [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly]] passed the bill, 'A special law for the Jeju uprising truth ascertainment and the regaining impaired reputation of the victims'. On January 12, 2000, the National Assembly legislated a law so the Korean government could begin conducting an investigation of the uprising. Due to this decision, it could be possible to expand the human rights of the residents of Jeju. On October 15, 2003, a truth ascertainment committee of the Jeju uprising was assembled according to the special law, and ascertained a fact-finding report of the Jeju uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Ki-Sueng |title=한나라당 제주도지부, 김총장 발언 유감 표명 |url= http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0000028398 |work=The Yonhapnews}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with the finding of the committee, on October 31, 2003, former president [[Roh moo-hyeon]] admitted that the brutal suppression of the uprising was a massive abuse of governmental power and made a public apology to the people of Jeju on behalf of the Republic of Korea.

===Controversy of the uprising===
Some right wing groups, including the Wallganjosun ({{Korean|hangul=월간조선}}), and Jaehyanggooninhoe ({{Korean|hangul=재향군인회}}) argued that the Jeju uprising was led and instigated by the [[Workers' Party of South Korea]].

Kim Gwang-dong, the director of researching policy in Korea argued that though the fundamental characteristic of the uprising is 'subversion of the system', there are a lot of skewed and biased studies that criticize the Korean government's faults when suppressing the rebellion. He said "it was an armed struggle and revolt of the forces who advocate communism against forces who support liberal democracy." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=제주 4.3 사건, 공산주의 위한 무장 폭동 |url=http://www.dailian.co.kr/news/view/146651 |work=Dailian{{Korean|hangul=데일리안}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Presbyterian minister, Lee Jong-yoon spoke at a church in Seoul that "the Jeju rising was incurred by the leftist forces and they provoked the rebellion to disturb the May 10 general election". This statement was broadcast through the [[Christian Television System|CTS]] channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kwon |first=Na-Kyeong |title=강남 대형교회에서 '광주출정가' 울려 퍼져 |url= http://www.vop.co.kr/A00000227793.html |work=Voiceofpeople }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 20, 2010, a chairman of an adjustment committee of past affairs, and a former new right, Lee Young-Jo argued that 'Jeju rising was apparent communist-led rebellion'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Young-Sub |title=제주 광주 격노, 망언한 이영조 사퇴하라 |url=http://www.viewsnnews.com/article?q=69334 |work=views&amp;news}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy about the legality of martial law===
There are controversies about the legality of martial law which took effect on November 17, 1948. One side that thinks it is illegal argued that effectuating martial law before the enactment of martial law is illegal according to the first constitution of South Korea. The other side argued that martial law from the Japanese colonial era still existed at the time so there are any violence of the effectuating martial law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&lt;the special law about Jeju rising and regaining reputation of victims&gt; |url= http://www.law.go.kr/LSW/lsSc.do?menuId=0&amp;p1=&amp;subMenu=1&amp;searchName=LicLs%2C0&amp;query=4.3#undefined }}&lt;/ref&gt; This part continued before August 15, 1948 and after the formation of the South Korean government.

===Post-processing and debating the Case===

Although the report of the accident started in June 2000, it was found to be 14,028 victims, but it is expected that the number will be higher since there are either unidentified or unidentifiable victims. On the other hand, about 180 soldiers died in combat, and 140 policemen died in the April 3 incident. October 31, 2003, a fact-finding commission in accordance with the opinion of the president is (Roh Moo-hyun) of the Nam-ro party, Jeju-si, Jeju-do, a clique mujangdae and the armed conflict and by state power in the course of suppression of a punitive force., and admitted to having made huge sacrifices. He issued a formal apology to the bereaved family and Jeju residents. On March 28, 2008, the Korea Institute of Science and Technology opened a 4-pyeong chemical aid project in Bonggae-dong, Jeju as part of a joint compensation program for the Jeju April 3 incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeju 4.3 incident|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1141380&amp;cid=40942&amp;categoryId=33385|website=Naver Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular media==
* ''[[Jiseul]]'' is a 2012 South Korean film about Jeju residents during the uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yun |first=Suh-young |title=Requiem for Jeju's forgotten masscre |url=http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2013/03/141_132311.html |work=[[The Korea Times]] |accessdate=March 20, 2013 |date=March 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328043735/http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2013/03/141_132311.html |archivedate=March 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zainichi Korean]] writer [[Kim Sok-pom]] wrote a novel titled ''Kazantō'' (''Volcanic Island'') about the event; his work is seen as controversial in South Korea and he has been denied entry to the country twice (in 1980 and 2015).&lt;ref name=Asahi&gt;{{cite web|title=Seoul bans entry to ethnic Korean writer on 1948 massacre – AJW by The Asahi Shimbun |url=https://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201510170053 |website=AJW by The Asahi Shimbun |accessdate=October 23, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020232612/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201510170053 |archivedate=October 20, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''잠들지 않는 남도'' (Namdo (남도) cannot sleep) is a Korean popular song with words and music by Ahn Chi Hwan. This song contains the agony of the victims of Jeju uprising. In 2013, [[Soreyu]] choir from Tokyo, Japan sang this song. A choir member of the Soreyu, [[Saito Gathuki]] said, "Years ago, I recognized the 4.3 affair through the documentary of [[NHK]]. Because I am in a generation before war, I couldn't know about the war and Korea. But now, I get to know the tragedy of war and massacre since I visit [Jeju]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/music/581121.html|title = We could learn the tragic history of Jeju by singing the song "Namdo cannot sleep": From peace island to war island |publisher = [[The Hankyoreh]] | last = Heo | first = Hojun |date = April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Junta of National Reconstruction''' (''Junta de Gobierno de Reconstrucción Nacional'') officially ruled [[Nicaragua]] from July 1979 to January 1985. Effective power was in the hands of the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]]'s National Directorate, led by [[Daniel Ortega]].

The Sandinista rebels announced the Junta as its provisional government on June 16, 1979, as the civil war against the [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]] regime entered its final phase. It was composed of five members: a member of the FSLN directorate, [[Daniel Ortega]], two [[left-wing]] activists, [[Sergio Ramírez]] and Moisés Hassan Morales, and two [[right-wing]] representatives, [[Alfonso Robelo]] and [[Violeta Barrios de Chamorro]].

In the first half of July, [[United States government]] envoy [[William G. Bowdler|William Bowdler]] pressured the Sandinistas to broaden the junta by adding more members, such as [[Adolfo Calero]], Ismael Reyes, and Mariano Fiallos.

After the fall of Somoza, it quickly became apparent to Robelo and Chamorro that they did not have any real power and Chamorro resigned on April 19, 1980, followed by Robelo three days later. On May 18, they were replaced by [[Arturo Cruz]] and Rafael Córdova Rivas. Cruz would resign in March 1981, though he agreed for a time to be ambassador to the [[United States]]. 

On March 4, Cruz's appointment to Washington was announced, together with Hassan's departure for the [[Council of State]] and Ortega's promotion to Coordinator of the now three-member junta. While the junta may have offered little authority to its non-Sandinista members, the public role did help to solidify Ortega's primacy within the FSLN directorate and enhance Ramírez's prominence.

On November 4, 1984, a [[Nicaraguan general election, 1984|presidential election]] was held, which was won by leading junta member and revolutionary Daniel Ortega and his running mate, Sergio Ramírez as vice president. However, some opposition parties boycotted it, claiming unfair conditions. While the [[Reagan administration]] and many mainstream [[United States media]] outlets alleged the election would be neither free nor fair, numerous electoral watchers affiliated with [[Western Europe]]an governments, as well as United States [[non-governmental organization]]s, declared the results legitimate.&lt;ref name = "bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title= On this day: 1984: Sandinistas claim election victory|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/5/newsid_2538000/2538379.stm|accessdate=2007-12-21

The '''Karnataka Wakf Board Land Scam''' concerns the alleged misappropriation of {{INRConvert|2000|b}} in Indian  property funds, made public by a report submitted by the [[Karnataka State Minorities Commission]] in 2012.

In March 2012, [[Anwar Manippady]], the Chairman of the [[Karnataka State Minorities Commission]] submitted a report to the chief minister of [[Karnataka]] state, [[D.V. Sadananda Gowda]], which alleged that 27,000 acres of land controlled by the Karnataka Wakf Board had either been misappropriated or allocated illegally. The value of the land has been estimated at Rs. 2&amp;nbsp;trillion ([[Long and short scales|short scale]]) (US$39 billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2012/03/27/another-39bn-indian-corruption-scandal-this-time-its-land/#axzz1qPnd4K3p
| title=Another $39bn Indian corruption scandal: this time it’s land | author=Neil Munshi| publisher=The Financial Times| date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Karnataka Wakf Board]] is a Muslim charitable trust that manages and oversees property that has typically been donated for the use of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karwakf.org/| title=Home | author=Karnataka State Board of Wakfs| publisher= Karnataka State Board of Wakfs | date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report commissioned by Manippady alleges that the Karnataka Wakf Board had allowed almost 50% of its land to be misappropriated by politicians and board members, in collusion with the real estate mafia for a fraction of its market value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Karnataka/Wakf-Board-land-scam-Report-submitted-to-Karnataka-govt/Article1-831182.aspx | title=Rs2 lakh cr-scam hits Karnataka Wakf Board | author=HT Correspondent| publisher=Hindustan Times| date=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manippady has recommended that the government established a committee to investigate corrupt activities on the Wakf Board and appoint a task force to recover properties that have been illegally sold by the Wakf Board. The Income Tax Department has already initiated a probe into this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/karnataka-waqf-board-scam/1/179593.html | title=Karnataka Wakf Board scam runs into Rs2 lakh crore: Report  | author=India Today| publisher=India Today| date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Canadian politics}}

This is a '''list of Canadian ministries''', the collective body of [[ministers of the Crown]] that [[advice (constitutional)|advises]] the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarch]]—presently Queen [[Elizabeth II]]—on how to exercise their [[Crown prerogative]]s. Since [[Canadian Confederation]], July 1, 1867, there have been 29 [[Ministry (collective executive)|ministries]].

In Canada, a ministry is formed when a new [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]] is appointed and dissolved when that individual leaves office. The one exception occurred in 1917, when [[incumbent]] Prime Minister Sir [[Robert Borden]] formed a new [[national unity government]] (the [[10th Canadian Ministry]]) as a [[World War I|wartime]] [[coalition government|coalition]] composed primarily of members of his own [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]] with some individual [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] [[Member of Parliament|members of parliament]].

In contrast to various other [[Commonwealth realm]]s (such as [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom]]) where a "new" ministry is considered to have been formed after every [[general election]] regardless of the winner, [[elections in Canada]] do not cause dissolution of the ministry unless they result in the government's defeat. As such, the current [[29th Canadian Ministry|29th Ministry]], chaired by Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]], began governing shortly before the opening of the [[42nd Parliament of Canada|42nd Parliament]] in 2015.

With a duration of 15 years, 87 days, the [[8th Canadian Ministry|8th Ministry]], under the leadersip of Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]], was the lengthiest; the 68-day-long [[7th Canadian Ministry|7th Ministry]], under the leadership of Sir [[Charles Tupper]], was the briefest. [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] led three ministries—the [[12th Canadian Ministry|12th]], [[14th Canadian Ministry|14th]], and [[16th Canadian Ministry|16th]]—the most for any Canadian prime minister.

{{Politics of the Philippines}}

Officially '''local government in the Philippines''', often called '''local government units''' or '''LGUs''', are divided into three levels – [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] and [[Cities of the Philippines|independent cities]]; component cities and [[Municipalities of the Philippines|municipalities]]; and [[barangay]]s.  In one area, above provinces and independent cities, is an [[autonomous region]], the [[Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao]]. Below barangays in some cities and municipalities are [[sitio]]s and [[purok]]s.  All of these, with the exception of sitios and puroks, elect their own [[executive branch|executive]]s and [[legislature]]s.  Sitios and puroks are often led by elected barangay councilors.

Provinces and independent cities are organized into [[Regions of the Philippines|national government regions]] but those are administrative regions and not separately governed areas with their own elected governments.

According to the [[Constitution of the Philippines]], the local governments "shall enjoy local autonomy", and in which the [[Philippine president]] exercises "general supervision". [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] enacted the [[Local Government Code of the Philippines]] in 1991 to "provide for a more responsive and accountable local government structure instituted through a system of decentralization with effective mechanisms of [[recall election|recall]], [[initiative]], and [[referendum]], allocate among the different local government units their powers, responsibilities, and resources, and provide for the qualifications, election, appointment and removal, term, salaries, powers and functions and duties of local officials, and all other matters relating to the organization and operation of local units."&lt;ref name="constitution:"&gt;{{cite web

==Levels of local government==
{{main|Administrative divisions of the Philippines}}

===Autonomous Regions===
{{main|Regions of the Philippines}}
Autonomous regions have more powers than other local governments. The constitution limits the creation of autonomous regions to [[Muslim Mindanao]] and [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|the Cordilleras]] but only one autonomous region exists: the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM). In 2001, [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao expansion and inclusion plebiscite, 2001|a plebiscite in the ARMM]] confirmed the previous composition of the autonomous region and added [[Basilan]] (except for the city of [[Isabela, Basilan|Isabela]]) and [[Marawi City]] in [[Lanao del Sur]].  Isabela City remains a part of the province of Basilan despite rejecting inclusion in the ARMM.  A [[Cordillera Autonomous Region]] has never been formed because no [[plebiscite]] has received the required support.

An autonomous region is governed by the regional governor and a legislature such as the [[ARMM Regional Legislative Assembly]].

===Provinces===
{{main|Provinces of the Philippines}}
Outside the lone autonomous region, the provinces are the highest-level local government. The provinces are organized into component cities and municipalities.  A province is governed by the governor and a legislature known as the [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]].

===Cities and municipalities===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines|Municipalities of the Philippines}}
[[Municipal government]] in the Philippines is divided into three – independent cities, component cities, and municipalities (sometimes referred to as towns).  Several cities across the country are "independent cities" which means that they are not governed by a province, even though like [[Iloilo City]] the provincial capitol might be in the city.  Independent city residents do not vote for nor hold provincial offices.   Far more cities are ''component cities'' and are a part of a province.  Municipalities are always a part of a province except for [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]] which was separated from [[Rizal]] to form [[Metro Manila]].

Cities and municipalities are governed by mayors and legislatures, which are called the [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]] in cities and the [[Sangguniang Bayan]] in municipalities.

===Barangays===
{{main|Barangay}}
Every city and municipality in the Philippines is divided into barangays, the smallest of the Local Government Units.  Barangays can be further divided into [[sitio]]s and [[purok]]s but those divisions do not have leaders elected in formal elections supervised by the national government.

A barangay's executive is the [[Punong Barangay]] or barangay captain and its legislature is the [[Sangguniang Barangay]], composed of barangay captain, the [[Barangay Kagawad]]s (barangay councilors) and the [[SK chairman]]. The SK chairman also leads a separate assembly for youth, the [[Sangguniang Kabataan]] or SK.

==Offices==
Local governments have two branches: [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[legislative]].  All courts in the Philippines are under the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] and therefore there are no local-government controlled [[judicial branch]]es.  Nor do local governments have any [[prosecutor]]s or [[public defender]]s, as those are under the jurisdiction of the national government.

The executive branch is composed of the regional governor for the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]], governor for the provinces, mayor for the cities and municipalities, and the barangay captain for the barangays.&lt;ref name="code3"&gt;[http://dilg.gov.ph/PDF_File/reports_resources/DILG-Resources-201162-99c00c33f8.pdf Local Government Code of the Philippines, Book III] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031103531/http://www.dilg.gov.ph/PDF_File/reports_resources/DILG-Resources-201162-99c00c33f8.pdf |date=2014-10-31 }}, [[Department of Interior and Local Government]] official website.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislatures===
The legislatures review the [[local ordinance|ordinances]] and [[resolution (law)|resolutions]] enacted by the legislatures below. Aside from regular and ''ex-officio'' members, the legislatures above the barangay level also have three [[sectoral representatives]], one each from women, agricultural or industrial workers, and other sectors.&lt;ref name="code3"/&gt;

==Responsibilities==
Among the social services and facilities that local government should provide, as stipulated in Section 17 of the Local Government Code, are the following:
*facilities and research services for agriculture and fishery activities, which include seedling nurseries, demonstration farms, and irrigation systems;
*health services, which include access to primary health care, maternal and child care, and medicines, medical supplies and equipment;
*social welfare services, which include programs and projects for women, children, elderly, and persons with disabilities, as well as vagrants, beggars, street children, juvenile delinquents, and victims of drug abuse;
*information services, which include job placement information systems and a public library;
*a solid waste disposal system or environmental management system;
*municipal/city/provincial buildings, cultural centers, public parks, playgrounds, and sports facilities and equipment;
*infrastructure facilities such as roads, bridges, school buildings, health clinics, fish ports, water supply systems, seawalls, dikes, drainage and sewerage, and traffic signals and road signs;
*public markets, slaughterhouses, and other local enterprises;
*public cemetery;
*tourism facilities and other tourist attractions; and
*sites for police and fire stations and substations and municipal jail.

==Creation and modification of local governments==
As a matter of principle, higher legislative entities have the power to create, divide, merge, abolish, or substantially alter boundaries of any lower-level local government through a law or ordinance, all subject to approval by a majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite to be conducted by the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] (COMELEC) in the local government unit or units directly affected.&lt;ref name="code3"/&gt; The Local Government Code has also set requisites for creating local government units.&lt;ref name="code3"/&gt; A summary can be found in the table below:
{|class=wikitable

However, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]]'s [[Sema v. COMELEC|decision on the unconstitutionality]] of the now-defunct province of [[Shariff Kabunsuan]]&lt;ref name="shk"&gt;[http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/publications/benchmark/2008/07/070810.php Creation of the province of Shariff Kabunsuan voided] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401052915/http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/publications/benchmark/2008/07/070810.php |date=2009-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has effectively confined the regional assembly's powers to creating or modifying only municipalities and barangays.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4784">There were two armies with the acronym MILPAS in Nicaragua.  The first, ''Milicias Populares Anti-Somocistas'', fought alongside the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] against the regime of [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]]. The second, ''Milicias Populares Anti-Sandinistas'', was one of the earliest rebel groups that would form the [[contras|contra]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Baltodano, Mónica (2010). ''Memories of the Sandinista struggle.'' Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung publishers, footnote 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Beginning in September 1978, the [[Frente Obrero]] and [[MAP-ML]] organized the Milicias Populares Anti-Somocistas. In rural areas, they fought in the north with [[Germán Pomares]], "El Danto." They also played important roles in the liberation of Leon, Chinandega and other cities and towns, and in Managua they fought on the barricades put up in the working class barrios, taking part in the final destruction of the National Guard in its last stronghold. Among the hundreds of MILPAS fighters killed was Hernaldo Herrera Tellez, “Nano,” the general secretary of FO and a member of the national leadership of MAP-ML.  MAP-ML and FO then dissolved the MILPAS they led on July 25,1979--several days after victory.&lt;ref&gt;''The Workers' Advocate'' (April 20,1984 Volume 14, Number 5) Section: The Insurrection https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-1/workers-advocate/14-5.html#article1144&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, MAP-ML and FO called upon the former Milicias Populares Anti-Somocistas fighters and others to support and join the Sandinista Popular Army and Militias as the contra war flared up against the new government,&lt;ref&gt;''Prensa Proletaria'', July 1987 https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-1/workers-advocate/17-9.html#article2797&lt;/ref&gt; with many heeding their call.&lt;ref&gt;''Prensa Proletaria'', April 1984 https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-1/workers-advocate/14-8.html#article1256&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;''Prensa Proletaria'', May 1987 https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-1/workers-advocate/17-7.html#article2699&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest [[contras]] inside Nicaragua were the MILPAS (''Milicias Populares Anti-Sandinistas''), peasant militias led by disillusioned Sandinistas. Founded by Pedro Joaquín González, whose nom de guerre was "Dimas", the Contra Milpistas were also known as ''chilotes'' (green corn). Even after his death, other MILPAS bands sprouted during 1980-1981. The Milpistas were composed largely of the campesino highlanders and rural workers who would later form the rank and file of the rebellion.

This MILPAS assimilated into the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force]] (FDN). By 1985, most of the FDN's regional commands were headed by MILPAS veterans. By late 1987, the ranks of ex-MILPAS regional commanders included:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6256">The '''Ministry of Interior, Public Safety and Decentralization''' of the [[Government of Niger]] is the government authority responsible for policing, internal security and the ongoing process of [[decentralization]] of authority to the [[Regions of Niger|Regions]], [[Departments of Niger|Departments]], and [[Communes of Niger]]. The [[National Police (Niger)|National Police]] and Paramilitary FNIS report to the Interior minister.  Unlike the [[Interior ministry]] in some nations, courts, Justice, and prosecution are handled by the [[Ministry of Justice of Niger]].  The Civil Defense Directorate, which coordinates disaster, fire, and civil defense responses nationwide reports to the Ministry of the Interior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icdo.org/pdf/struc/niger-en.pdf INTERNATIONAL CIVIL DEFENCE DIRECTORY: Civil Defence Directorate (Direction de la Protection Civile)]. Retrieved 2009-02-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of the Interior is headed by the  ''Minister of State for the Interior, Public Safety and Decentralization'', a political appointment who sits in the [[Council of Ministers of Niger]], reporting directly to the [[President of Niger]].

==Interior==
Interior and border control, including some policing duties, are carried out through the General Directorate of Territorial Administration (''Direction Générale de l’Administration Territoriale''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afdevinfo.com/htmlreports/org/org_50313.html AfDevInfo Database: General Directorate of Territorial Administration]. Organisation Record, Ministry of Interior &amp; Decentralisation.

Organisation Record, Ministry of Interior &amp; Decentralisation. Retrieved 2009-02-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public safety==
"Public Safety" was appended to the title in 2004 when the National Police and FNIS were transfer to the Interior Ministry from the [[Defense Ministry of Niger]].

==Decentralization==
''Decentralization'' was appended to the title by the 1999 constitution. The Minister of Interior in previous governments was the head of local government institutions. Following the move to decentralize government powers in the 1990s, most of the duties of the local appointed [[Prefect]]—who was chosen and answered to the Ministry—was taken over by the [[Communes of Niger]], as well as the Departments and Regions.  The Ministry of Interior still appoints prefects, but they play a much more limited role, as local representatives of national government.  In some largely uninhabited areas, especially those in the [[Sahara Desert]], the Interior Ministry still appoints heads of ''Postes Administratif'' (Administrative Posts).  Previously drawn from the [[Military of Niger]] they now are officers of the FNIS.

{{Main|Protocols of the Elders of Zion}}

'''Natalie de Bogory''' (also known as '''Natalie Debogory''' or '''Natalie DeBogory-Mokriyevich''') (1887&amp;ndash;1939) is primarily known for her work in translating from the [[Russian language]] into the [[English language]], and subsequently distributing and participating in having published the first or second [[United States|American]] edition in the [[United States]] of the document known as the [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]. There were two different editions printed in the United States in 1920. The earlier, entitled ''[[The Protocols and World Revolution]]'', associated with [[Boris Brasol]] and published by [[Small, Maynard and Company]]. The later, entitled ''[[Praemonitus Praemunitus]]'' associated with [[Harris A. Houghton]] and published by the [[Beckwith Company]].

==Biography==
She was the granddaughter of two servicemen of the [[tsar]] of [[Russia]]. One of her grandfathers resigned being a colonel-lieutenant, another one was a major. Her father Vladimir Karpovich Debogory-Mokriyevich (May 24, 1848 - Nov. 2, 1926) had been imprisoned under the [[tsarist]] government for revolutionary activities. He was a well-known Russian Revolutionary-[[Narodniks|Narodnik]] (Populist), who escaped from prison in [[Siberia]] and later married her mother Julie Gortynsky (1860 -1933?) in [[Switzerland]]. 

Her mother Julie Gortynsky was from a noble family and educated at the Kiev Institute for noble girls in Kiev (Gortynsky family clan produced many well educated women: Julie's cousin Maria Gortynsky-Pavlova (1854 - 1938) was the first Russian woman - professor of Paleontology and academician of Academy of Sciences of [[USSR]], her other cousin Olga Gortynsky (1855 - 1903) was among the first Russian women licensed to practice as a Doctor of Medicine). Upon graduation Julie studied in [[Paris]] and [[Geneva]]. 

Natalie was born in Geneva on April 15, 1887 and was in Russia a few times until 1895 when her mother Julie was exiled from Russia with no permission to return due to her unreliability and close ties with emigre Vladimir Debogory-Mokrievich. After [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]'s amnesty of 1905 Julie returned to Russia and Natalie had never seen her mother again. Natalie married [[Albert Sonnichsen]], a writer,&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who; 1919''&lt;/ref&gt; had one child Eric in 1909, and was divorced from him in 1919. Eventually she moved to Paris, after losing custody of her son in a very public legal fight, and she worked as [[Sol Hurok]]'s publicity person in Europe and eventually a writer for the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''. She died in 1939 in Paris, and her ashes are interred in vault no. 4780 in the [[columbarium]] at [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris.

She worked as the assistant of the physician and military intelligence officer in the service of the [[United States Department of War|U.S. War Department]], [[Harris Ayers Houghton]], who paid for her services out of his own private funds. Houghton engaged her as his personal and investigative assistant for nine months, and subsequently claimed that no public funds were used for her services. She had obtained a Russian version of the [[Protocols of Zion]] from the notorious [[White Movement|White Russian]] and extremely [[antisemitic]] tsarist officer [[Boris Brasol]], and thereafter she requested, under her own initiative and received authorization to translate it into the [[English language]]. She did not work alone, however, but with close consultation with Brasol, and another former [[tsarist]] officer, General [[G. J. Sosnowsky]].

===Donbass elections===
{{main|Donbass general elections, 2014}}

On 2 November 2014, internationally unrecognized elections were held in the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics. The New Russia Party was refused registration in the DPR because it had not held a founding conference.&lt;ref name="http://www.mk.ru/politics/2014/10/30/dadut-li-novorossii-sdelat-vybor.html" /&gt; It subsequently stood candidates under the [[Free Donbass]] grouping, which received 31.6% of the vote.&lt;ref name="http://www.mk.ru/politics/2014/10/30/dadut-li-novorossii-sdelat-vybor.html" /&gt;

[[Ekaterina Gubareva]] was set to head the election list of Free Donbass party for the [[People's Soviet of the Donetsk People's Republic]] of 11 November 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://meduza.io/news/2018/09/07/parlament-dnr-smenil-ispolnyayuschego-obyazannosti-glavy-respubliki|title=Парламент ДНР сменил исполняющего обязанности главы республики|work=Meduza|access-date=2018-09-07|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on 29 September 2018 she was excluded from this list after she was hold in custody by unknown people.&lt;ref&gt;http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/220836&lt;/ref&gt; After this incident she left for [[Rostov-on-Don]] (in [[Russia]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/220836&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanctions===

As part of the [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|sanctions imposed]] during the [[Ukrainian crisis]], the party was placed on US sanctions lists on 19 December 2014. The [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] stated that the party, which had been "created to unite all supporters for the establishment of an independent federal state of Novorossiya and to withdraw all southeastern lands in Ukraine from the authority of Kyiv", was "designated because it has engaged in actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of Ukraine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl9729.aspx|title= Treasury Targets Additional Ukrainian Separatists and Russian Individuals and Entities |date=19 December 2014|accessdate=14 February 2015|publisher=U.S. Department of the Treasury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Old Firm''' is the collective name for the Scottish [[association football|football]] clubs [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], which are both based in [[Glasgow]]. The two clubs are by far the most successful and popular in Scotland, and the rivalry between them has become deeply embedded in Scottish culture. It has reflected, and contributed to, political, social, and religious division and [[sectarianism]] in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/sport/other_football/15149515.Passion__pride__tradition_and_nastiness__Why_Old_Firm_match_is_greatest_derby_in_the_world/|title=Passion, pride, tradition and nastiness: Why Old Firm match is greatest derby in the world|work=Evening Times|date=11 March 2017|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the fixture has had an enduring appeal around the world.&lt;ref name="FIFA"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326141358/https://www.fifa.com/news/y=2009/m=2/news=old-firm-enduring-appeal-1023776.html|archivedate=26 March 2018|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/rivalries/newsid=1023776/index.html |title=Classic Rivalries: Old Firm's enduring appeal |publisher=[[FIFA]] |date=16 April 2016|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[1985–86 in Scottish football|1985–86 season]], one half of the Old Firm has won the [[Scottish Premier League|Scottish League]] consistently and in all but [[2005–06 Scottish Premier League|one]] of seventeen seasons between [[1995–96 in Scottish football|1995–96]] and [[2011–12 in Scottish football|2011–12]], both clubs finished in the top two places. In recent years Rangers have endured financial difficulties, and were liquidated in 2012. Subsequently, they were re-established as a new company and entered the fourth tier of the Scottish league. Celtic have won the last seven consecutive Scottish championships.

Celtic and Rangers have played each other 414 times in major competitions: Rangers have won 159 matches, Celtic 156 matches, and 99 ended in a draw.&lt;ref name="soccerabaseh2h"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rsssfh2h"/&gt;

The clubs have large fan bases around Glasgow and Scotland, and have supporters clubs in most towns throughout Scotland and Northern Ireland and in many cities around the world. In 2005 the presence of Rangers and Celtic was estimated to be worth £120 million to the [[Economy of Scotland|Scottish economy]] each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Old Firm on the ball for economy|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4635535.stm|work=BBC |publisher=BBC News  |date=29 June 2005|accessdate=29 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of 'Old Firm'==
The origin of the term is unclear but may derive from the two clubs' initial match in which the commentators referred to the teams as "like two old, firm friends",&lt;ref&gt;Murray, William J. (1984) The Old Firm: sectarianism, sport, and society in Scotland; Edinburgh: J. Donald Publishers; Atlantic Highlands, N.J. {{ISBN|0-85976-121-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively may stem from a [[Satire|satirical]] cartoon published in a magazine prior to the [[1904 Scottish Cup Final]] between the sides, depicting an elderly man with a [[sandwich board]] reading ''"Patronise The Old Firm: Rangers, Celtic Ltd"'', highlighting the mutual commercial benefits of their meetings.&lt;ref name=classic&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/13198793.Six_classic_matches__the_birth_of_the_Old_Firm_and_the_day_Hampden_burned/|title=Six classic matches: the birth of the Old Firm and the day Hampden burned|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=1 June 2017|publisher=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=joined&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/the-old-firm-story-when-fans-joined-forces-to-riot-1-4162491|title=The Old Firm story: When fans joined forces to riot|date=24 June 2016|accessdate=1 June 2017|publisher=[[The Scotsman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name may also be a reference to these two teams being among the original eleven members of the [[Scottish Football League]] formed in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Graham and Alan Bairner.

==Rivalry and sectarianism==
{{Main|Sectarianism in Glasgow}}

The competition between the two clubs had roots in more than just a simple sporting rivalry.&lt;ref name="FIFA"/&gt; It has as much to do with Northern Ireland as Scotland and this can be seen in the flags, cultural symbols, and emblems of both clubs.&lt;ref name="Alottodo"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2324152/Old-Firm-rivalry-Its-a-lot-to-do-with-football.html|title=Old Firm rivalry? It's a lot to do with football|work=The Telegraph|location=London|first=Roddy|last=Forsyth|date=26 October 2007|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was infused with a series of complex disputes, sometimes centred on [[religion]] ([[Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]]), [[Northern Ireland]]-[[Politics of Northern Ireland|related politics]] ([[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist]] and [[Irish Republicanism|Republican]]), national identity (British or Irish Scots), and social ideology ([[Conservatism in the United Kingdom|Conservatism]] and [[Socialism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wilson, "Inside the Divide" (Edinburgh: Canongate Books, 2012), p. 87: "What is being asserted is two identities: Rangers and Celtic. There are other boundaries: Protestant and Catholic / Unionist and Republican / Conservative and Socialist...."&lt;/ref&gt;

Another primary contributor to the intensity of the rivalry in the west of Scotland was that Rangers supporters are historically native Scots and [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]],&lt;ref name=define/&gt; and Celtic supporters are historically [[Irish-Scots]]. Although the confrontation between the two sets of supporters was often labelled as 'Sectarianism', 'Native-Immigrant tension' was an equally accurate catalyst for hostility between the two teams' supports in Scotland. Rangers' traditional support was largely from the Protestant community, and for decades the club had an [[unwritten rule]] whereby they [[Rangers F.C. signing policy|would not knowingly sign a player of the Catholic faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotzine.com/2012/12/fran-sandaza-interview-opens-up-old-wounds-of-sectarianism/ |title=Fran Sandaza interview opens up old wounds of Sectarianism at Rangers |work=Scotzine |date=2012-12-30 |accessdate=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was decried by [[Graeme Souness]] when he became manager, and he brought ex-Celtic forward [[Mo Johnston]] to the club in a very public move away from the practice, which no longer continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rangers.co.uk/club/history/club-history/item/507-the-souness-revolution |title=The Souness Revolution |work=www.rangers.co.uk |publisher=Rangers FC |date= |accessdate=2 December 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005080733/http://www.rangers.co.uk/club/history/club-history/item/507-the-souness-revolution |archivedate=5 October 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mojo&gt;{{cite web|author=Ewan Murray |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/jul/10/maurice-mo-johnston-rangers-celtic |title=Why Mo Johnston still stirs emotions across Glasgow |work=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mojo2&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jul/11/rangers-sign-catholic |title=10 July 1989: Rangers sign a Catholic |first=Bill |last=McMurdo |work=The Guardian |publisher= |date=11 July 2009 |accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFPdivide/&gt; Celtic's support was largely from those of [[Irish people|Irish]] Roman Catholic backgrounds and while the club practiced no exclusion of Protestants and signed many of them to play for the team, there was a pro-Catholic mindset among some of the employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Andrew|title=Tommy Gemmell: The Celtic full-back who took role to the future |url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/tommy-gemmell-the-celtic-full-back-who-took-role-to-the-future-1-4381762|accessdate=1 June 2017|work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One effect is that [[Flag of Scotland|Scottish flag]]s are rarer than might be expected amongst both sets of supporters; Celtic fans are more likely to wave the [[Flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]] while Rangers fans tend to wave the [[Union Jack]].&lt;ref name=disunited/&gt;

There was serious fan disorder during an Old Firm match played on a Sunday evening in May 1999 at [[Celtic Park]], with the usual tensions heightened by the fact that Rangers could [[1998-99 Scottish Premier League|clinch the league title]] with victory (and it became clear that they would do so from the early stages of the match). Several objects were thrown by Celtic fans, one of which struck referee [[Hugh Dallas]] forcing the game to be stopped while he received medical treatment.&lt;ref name = "dallas"/&gt;&lt;ref name=disunited/&gt;&lt;ref name=moments/&gt; With many of those in attendance having spent a full weekend drinking alcohol prior to the event, at least four Celtic fans invaded the field of play to confront Dallas during the game,&lt;ref name = "dallas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/scottish_premier/334094.stm |title=Rangers make history out of chaos |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News|date=3 May 1999|accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more missiles were thrown at players on the pitch after the game.&lt;ref name = "dallas"/&gt; Since the events of that day, Old Firm league matches have normally been played in the early afternoon and the possibility of an Old Firm title decider has been deliberately avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/sport/spl/2927038/Old-Firm-date-is-set-to-avoid-title-trouble.html|title=Old Firm date is set to avoid title trouble|work=The Scottish Sun|publisher=News International|last=MacKay|first=Ronnie|date=10 April 2010|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Drysdale|first=Neil|publisher=STV Sport|date=14 April 2010|accessdate=28 November 2010|title=Old Firm derby reduced to a mere sideshow?

===Incidents involving players===
Over the hundreds of matches played between the rivals, players and staff have been involved in many incidents beyond the usual bad tackles and red cards commonly associated with derby mataches around the world; in the modern age of video footage, such incidents are more frequently observed, reviewed and scrutinised. [[Rangers F.C. 2–2 Celtic F.C.

In 2000, after being sent off during an Old Firm match, Rangers midfielder [[Barry Ferguson]] was involved in a violent brawl with Celtic fans at a hotel later in the same evening;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BARRY+WATCH+K.O.%3b+Reconstruction+of+what+really+went+on+at+the+Battle...-a064963416 |title=Barry Watch K.O.; Reconstruction of what really went on at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge |date=3 September 2000 |work=Sunday Mail |first=Charles |last=Lavery |via=The Free Library (Farlex) |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a year later, Ferguson (by now club captain) was sitting in the stand when he appeared to throw ice packs towards the Celtic dugout after Rangers conceded a late goal, however the referee missed the incident and no action was taken.&lt;ref name=action&gt;{{cite web |title=Football: Clubs must take action |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Football%3a+Clubs+must+take+action.-a078946600 |date=7 October 2001 |work=Sunday Mirror |first=Ray |last=Hepburn |via=The Free Library (Farlex) |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same match, a Celtic supporter was photographed making an 'aeroplane' gesture towards American Rangers player [[Claudio Reyna]] a few weeks after the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name=action/&gt; A 2004 match at Ibrox which "descended into even more mayhem and madness than usual" led to a police enquiry over the conduct of the players and staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/nov/22/match.rangers|title=Inquiry into Old Firm mayhem|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Graham Clark|date=22 November 2004|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/4025379.stm|title=Rangers 2–0 Celtic |work=BBC Sport|date=20 November 2004|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, Celtic goalkeeper [[Artur Boruc]] was cautioned by the police for gestures he made to Rangers supporters during a match at Ibrox; six months later, it was clarified that this was for "Conduct which appears to incite disorder" rather than simply making the [[sign of the cross]] as he entered his area, as some had thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5292656.stm|title=Player caution 'not for blessing' |work=BBC News|date=28 August 2006|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also blessed himself in the fixture in December of that year, annoying Rangers fans who saw it as a provocative act, although the police stated that no offence had been committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/celtic-keeper-makes-rangers-fans-cross-1-734722|title=Celtic keeper makes Rangers fans cross|work=The Scotsman|date=18 December 2006|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boruc, who became known as the 'Holy Goalie' for his overt displays of his Catholic faith, escaped personal punishment in 2008 for displaying a t-shirt with the slogan "God bless the Pope" and an image of fellow Pole [[Pope John Paul II]] after an Old Firm win at Parkhead in April 2008, although Celtic faced scrutiny from FIFA as it was an unauthorised garment under their regulations on slogans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/celtic-keeper-boruc-escapes-sfa-action-over-old-firm-pope-tshirt-7266598.html|title=Celtic keeper Boruc escapes SFA action over Old Firm Pope T-shirt |work=[[Evening Standard]]|date=29 April 2008 |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2298874/Celtic-may-carry-can-for-Boruc-behaviour.html|title=Celtic may carry can for Boruc behaviour|work=Daily Telegraph|author=Ewing Grahame|date=30 April 2008|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was fined £500 and warned for (non-religious) gestures made towards Rangers fans in a defeat at the same venue in September of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/09/celtic.rangers|title=Boruc in trouble again over Old Firm 'gesture'|work=The Guardian|date=9 September 2008|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/09/celtic.rangers|title=Boruc escapes with £500 fine for stirring up Rangers fans |work=The Guardian|author=Ben Rumsby|date=24 October 2008|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to an international match between [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and [[Poland national football team|Poland]] in 2009, graffiti of a threatening nature mentioning Boruc appeared on walls in a Rangers-supporting area of Belfast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/death-threat-to-celtic-star-boruc-before-world-cup-game-1655567.html|title=Death threat to Celtic star Boruc before World Cup game|work=The Independent|date=27 March 2009 |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, an angry exchange took place on the touchline at Celtic Park between Celtic manager [[Neil Lennon]] and Rangers assistant coach [[Ally McCoist]], requiring police officers to separate them, at the end of a match in which three players had also been dismissed; again captured on live television footage, the incident resulted in both men being banned from the dugout for disconduct.&lt;ref name=moments/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/mar/10/neil-lennon-ally-mccoist-sfa|title=Celtic's Neil Lennon and Ally McCoist of Rangers guilty of misconduct |work=The Guardian|author=Ewan Murray|date=10 March 2011|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/scottish-premier/8374330/Neil-Lennon-and-Ally-McCoist-banned-over-touchline-confrontation-during-Celtics-win-over-Rangers.html|title=Neil Lennon and Ally McCoist banned over touchline confrontation during Celtic's win over Rangers|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|author=Roddy Forsyth|date=10 March 2011|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 'crisis meeting' was convened involving the clubs, the Scottish Government and Strathclyde Police some days later regarding the trend of violence among supporters away from the pitch increasing on Old Firm mathdays and concerns that incidents during the matches was a factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/scottish-premier/8369897/Old-Firm-agree-six-point-plan-to-curb-derby-turmoil.html|title=Old Firm agree six-point plan to curb derby turmoil|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|author=Roddy Forsyth|date=8 March 2011|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident occurred during the tense environment of [[2010–11 in Scottish football|a season]] where seven Old Firm matches took place (including a [[2011 Scottish League Cup Final|League Cup final]] and a [[2010–11 Scottish Premier League|fight for the title]] eventually won by Rangers by one point).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/9484609.stm|title=Kilmarnock 1 – 5 Rangers|work=BBC Sport|date=15 May 2011|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visitor allocation and crushing incident===
During the 2018 close season, Rangers announced that they would be cutting the ticket allocation for Celtic fans at Ibrox from around 7,000 (the entire Broomloan Stand) to 800, situated in a corner where smaller travelling supports were usually accommodated, following a fan survey backing the proposal as well as an upturn in season ticket sales. In response, Celtic indicated they would do likewise, bringing to an end a long tradition of both clubs offering an generous proportion of their stadium to their rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/rangers-cut-celtic-ticket-allocation-to-800-1-4744615 | title=Rangers cut Celtic ticket allocation to 800 | work=The Scotsman | date=24 May 2018 | accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development was criticised by former players as diluting the famous atmosphere of the fixtures,&lt;ref name=donnelly&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/sport/16251770.Former_Celtic_striker_Simon_Donnelly__it_s_not_the_fans_that_make_the_difference_but_the_quality_of_the_players/ | title=Former Celtic striker Simon Donnelly: it's not the fans that make the difference but the quality of the players  | work=Evening Times | date=26 May 2018 | accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/rangers-board-put-scottish-football-12598671 | title=Rangers board have put Scottish football back years with farcical Celtic ticket decision - Chris Sutton | work=Daily Record| date=26 May 2018 | accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; although others praised the extra income the change would likely generate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/rangers-decision-cut-celtics-ticket-12597588 | title=Rangers decision to cut Celtic's ticket allocation was justified as it will generate money for Steven Gerrard - Barry Ferguson | work=Daily Record| date=26 May 2018 | accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first Old Firm fixture at Celtic Park under the new arrangements, many more home fans were able to attend but segregation was still required outside the stadium to keep them apart from the smaller away support. In the minutes before kick-off, a main access road was closed as part of the amended segregation plan and thousands of spectators approaching Celtic Park from both directions were directed to the narrow enclosed walkway below the North Stand to reach the opposite side of the stadium, along with those trying to enter that stand via turnstiles. The volume of people in the walkway area built up to the extent that many were unable to move forward with more approaching from either side, and [[Stampede#Human stampedes and crushes|crushing]] was experienced in the congested area for some minutes, causing panic, with several fans scaling a high perimeter wall and fence to escape; one of them fell from the wall and later required hospital treatment, while four other persons were treated at the scene as the situation subsided. Those involved expressed their anger afterwards regarding the arrangements and the policing at the stadium on the day, with Celtic issuing an official apology to the fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-45396058 | title=Celtic apologise to fans after crush incident before Old Firm game | work=[[BBC News]] | date=3 September 2018 | accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/celtic-fans-demand-probe-terrifying-13183745 | title=Celtic fans demand probe into terrifying crush before Rangers game to ensure it never happens again | work=Daily Record| date=3 September 2018 | accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/16686313.celtic-park-crush-dad-takes-traumatised-son-15-to-hospital/ | title=Celtic Park ‘crush’: Dad takes traumatised son, 15, to hospital | work=Evening Times | date=4 September 2018 | accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
From 1 March 2012, the police were given more powers to act against Sectarian acts at football matches through the new [[Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012]]. The law was designed specifically to target the Old Firm rivalry by reducing the religious hatred between the two opposing sides.&lt;ref name=eternal/&gt; The Act created two new offences, one covering behaviour in and around football matches and the other related to posts sent by either electronic or postal methods. People convicted under the act could face up to five years imprisonment, a much higher sentence than was previously in place. It was hoped it would make it much easier to prosecute this misbehaviour, which had proved difficult in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-20205917 |title=New sectarian law hailed a success by Lord Advocate |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013 a protest by a number of Celtic fans took place to protest against the new laws and the subsequent match bans that a number of fans had received for breaking the Act. The protesters, known as the "[[Green Brigade]]," had marched without police authority and the event was therefore cracked down on by local authorities resulting in thirteen arrests. The protestors claim that the police instigated the trouble that occurred at this march.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-21813699 |title=Arrests made as Green Brigade protest is broken up |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the march, media coverage reported that the fans were growing further apart from the police than ever before. They claimed that the trust the fans hold with the police to work in cooperation with them is falling dramatically. The march that took place resulted in a number of complaints from both Celtic and Rangers fan groups that they were harassed by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-21849341 |title=Old Firm fans in danger of 'losing trust in police', say MSPs |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=BBC |date=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labour MSP [[James Kelly (Scottish politician)|James Kelly]] introduced the ''Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Repeal) (Scotland) Bill'' in June 2017. Kelly had described the 2012 legislation as having "completely failed to tackle sectarianism" and as "illiberal" which "unfairly targets football fans", and was "condemned by legal experts, human rights organisations and equality groups".&lt;ref name=eternal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Report - 25 January 2018|url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/report.aspx?r=11325&amp;mode=pdf|website=Scottish Parliament|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Sir [[Tom Devine]] previously spoke of the Football Act as "''the most illiberal and counterproductive act passed by our young Parliament to date''" and a "''stain on the reputation of the Scottish legal system for fair dealing''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sheriff who called SNP's anti-bigotry law 'mince' steps down from bench after 27 years|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/sheriff-who-called-snps-anti-8222982|work=Daily Record|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much was made of when a Sheriff described the law as "mince".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=James|title=Why the SNP must scrap the act|url=https://scraptheact.com/2018/01/23/agenda-column/|website=ScrapTheAct|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events post-2012==
{{Main|Administration and liquidation of The Rangers Football Club plc}}

In 2012, Rangers suffered a financial collapse leading to the liquidation of the commercial entity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-20141946|title=Lord Hodge approves liquidation of former Rangers FC|work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=31 October 2012 |accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18413384|title=Rangers in liquidation Q&amp;A|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 June 2012|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the sporting assets were [[Ownership of Rangers F.C.|acquired by a new company]]&lt;ref name = "smith"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-18447530|title=Charles Green completes Rangers purchase despite Walter Smith bid|publisher=BBC News|date=14 June 2012|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed its playing membership to continue unbroken (albeit in the lowest division of the [[Scottish football league system]]).&lt;ref name="SFA website"&gt;{{cite news|title=Agreement on Transfer of Membership|url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_fa_news.cfm?page=2986&amp;newsID=10252&amp;newsCategoryID=1|date=27 July 2012|publisher=SFA website|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, this would mean that for the first time in 120 years, no fixtures would be played between Rangers and Celtic.

The status of the Old Firm was also challenged,&lt;ref name=define&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/the-old-firm-story-how-sectarianism-came-to-define-a-derby-1-4166492|title=The Old Firm story: How sectarianism came to define a derby|last=Smith|first=Andrew|publisher=The Scotsman|date=1 July 2016 |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the logic that since Rangers 'died' during the events of 2012, the rivalry also expired and any matches played since that point would be between Celtic and a 'new Rangers', albeit playing at the same stadium, in the same colours, with the same supporters and some of the same players as before.&lt;ref name = "smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name=demise&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.scot/news/14863559.Hugh_MacDonald__Why_does_the_demise_or_otherwise_of_Rangers_matter_so_much_/|title=Why does the demise or otherwise of Rangers matter so much?|first=Hugh|last=MacDonald|publisher=The National|date=26 March 2016|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents to this point of view refer to the club disparagingly as ''Sevco'' (the original name of the post-2012 holding company),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://local.stv.tv/glasgow/186158-falkirk-fc-stadium-announcer-suspended-after-rangers-sevco-comment/ |title=Falkirk FC stadium announcer suspended after Rangers 'Sevco' comment |publisher=STV |date=20 August 2012 |accessdate=13 October 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830154625/http://local.stv.tv/glasgow/186158-falkirk-fc-stadium-announcer-suspended-after-rangers-sevco-comment/ |archivedate=30 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rangers supporters as 'zombies' or 'the undead'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14728943.Irish_pub_causes_a_stir_with_a_Zombie_Rangers_FC_advert/|title=Irish pub in Glasgow causes a stir with a Zombie Rangers FC advert|publisher=The Herald|date=8 September 2016 |accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference of opinion became a new factor in the rivalry.&lt;ref name=demise/&gt;

Some Celtic supporters were particularly vociferous in their assertions, to the extent of a group paying for a full-page newspaper advertisement in January 2015 announcing that their club would soon play its first fixture against the new Rangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/celtic-fans-spark-storm-protest-5040733|title=Celtic fans spark storm of protest after claiming Rangers are new club and "Old Firm" derby is dead in newspaper advert|publisher=Daily Record|date=25 January 2015|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/former-rangers-heroes-laugh-celtic-5042508|title=Former Rangers heroes laugh off Celtic fans' advert that claims Ibrox outfit is a new club|publisher=Daily Record|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/old-firm-once-hampden-rocking-5047530|title=Old Firm?

In 2013 numerous complaints were made to the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) over official marketing communications from Rangers which stated they were "Scotland’s most successful club", with this claim being disputed as the complainants declared the club had only been in existence for one year. Having considered the evidence including advice from UEFA, the ASA did not uphold the complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/the-rangers-football-club-ltd-a13-224406.html|title=ASA Adjudication on The Rangers Football Club Ltd|publisher=[[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|ASA]]|date=18 December 2013 |accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, a large [[Tifo|banner]] was displayed at Celtic Park during a game showing a cartoon zombie representing Rangers rising from the grave before being shot by a sniper, drawing criticism due to the gunman resembling a paramilitary from the Northern Ireland conflict, although Celtic escaped formal punishment over the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/13076679.Celtic_cleared_over_zombie_banner_but_issue_still_rankles/|title=Celtic cleared over zombie banner but issue still rankles|publisher=The Herald|date=11 October 2012 |accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/celtic-cleared-by-sfa-over-zombie-banner-at-norwich-match-1-2568427|title=Celtic cleared by SFA over ‘zombie’ banner at Norwich match|publisher=The Scotsman|date=12 October 2012|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Green Brigade|Celtic fan groups]] have continued to display banners claiming Rangers are ‘dead’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/celtic-fans-unveil-rip-banner-aimed-at-rangers-1-4567971 |title=Celtic fans unveil RIP banner aimed at Rangers |publisher=The Scotsman|date=23 September 2017 |accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as mocking other aspects of their economic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/713609/celtic-fans-blasted-after-trainspotting-themed-banner-mocks-rangers-over-cash-woes-and-child-abuse/ |title=CHOOSE STRIFE: Celtic fans blasted after Trainspotting-themed banner mocks Rangers over cash woes and child abuse |publisher=The Sun|date=13 March 2017|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hampden, [[Scotland national football team|Scotland's national stadium]] and home of [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]], is situated roughly an equal distance from Ibrox and Celtic Park in Glasgow. Due to the frequency of the two teams appearing in semi-finals and finals held there (often facing one another), its West and East stands are always allocated to the same club and are informally known as the ''Rangers end'' and ''Celtic end'' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/champions_league/1990319.stm|title=Hampden enjoys the party|quote=Once inside, the disparity in terms of support was even more evident, with the Spanish followers occupying the whole of what is traditionally regarded as the Rangers end of the ground.

The [[1971 Ibrox disaster]] – in which 66 Rangers supporters died in a crush on an exterior stairway – occurred at the end of an Old Firm match,&lt;ref name="proud"/&gt; although the identity of the opposition was not a factor in the incident other than having drawn a large crowd of at least 75,000 to the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/rangers/8230503/The-Ibrox-Disaster-of-January-2-1971-which-claimed-66-lives-was-a-tragedy-waiting-to-happen.html|title= The Ibrox Disaster of January 2, 1971 which claimed 66 lives was a tragedy waiting to happen|first=Roddy|last=Forsyth|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=30 December 2010|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since redevelopments completed in the 1990s, all three venues are all-seater with much smaller capacities of between 50,000 and 60,000, meaning the above records may never be beaten – the attendance of 72,069 at 'old style' Hampden for the Old Firm [[1989 Scottish Cup Final]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19890522&amp;id=izNAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RlkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3687,251027 |newspaper=The Glasgow Herald |date=22 May 1989 |page=22 |title=Tension and fear spoil show-piece |first=James |last=Traynor |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has become a landmark figure as no match in Scotland has come close to matching it since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/hearts-clash-celtic-scottish-footballs-13466380.amp |title=Hearts’ clash with Celtic will boast Scottish football’s biggest crowd in 29 years |work=Daily Record |date=24 October 2018|author=Gavin Berry |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Average attendances===
When compared to other clubs in Scotland, the Old Firm maintain considerably higher attendances;&lt;ref name=efsavesco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/nav/attnsco.htm|title=Attendances – Scotland|work=european-football-statistics.co.uk|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celtic's recorded crowds tend to be higher than Rangers as their stadium holds approximately 9,000 more seats. Both clubs (among others) have been accused of inflating their attendance figures by counting all season ticket holders in the crowd when many have not actually attended the match in question, with the accurate figures reported to the police for crowd control being lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/celtic--rangers-attendances-up-1767244|title=Celtic &amp; Rangers attendances up to 20,000 per game lower than figures released to public, say police|work=Daily Record|date=16 March 2013|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/28/football-clubs-leagues-attendance-figures-arsenal-celtic-mls|title=Football clubs should stop exaggerating their attendance figures |work=The Guardian|author=Ian Thomson|date=28 September 2017|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dominance of Scottish football==
{{See also|History of Scottish football#Old Firm Domination}}

The intensity of the rivalry is fuelled by the clubs' historical duopoly in Scottish football, with most meetings between them being pivotal in deciding the destiny of a championship or cup and anything but a title-winning season seen as a major disappointment, particularly as it would usually mean 'the enemy' has won the trophy.

[[File:Old Firm pic.PNG|thumb|320px|left|Side-by-side comparison of Celtic's and Rangers' final league positions from 1891–2017]]
Statistics show that Rangers and Celtic have been by far the most successful clubs involved in the [[Scottish Football League]] since its formation in [[1890–91 in Scottish football|1890]]. The pair were the only participants in every edition of the competition until [[2011–12 in Scottish football|2012]], when Rangers were [[Administration and liquidation of The Rangers Football Club Plc|removed from the top tier for economic reasons]]; they returned for the [[2016–17 in Scottish football|2016–17]] season. Of the [[List of Scottish football champions|121 championships played]], 103 (85%) have been won by one of the Old Firm with Rangers ahead on 54 titles to Celtic's 49, and 19 between ten other clubs (including a shared title between Rangers and [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]]).

Although there have been brief periods when silverware went elsewhere, there have also been long spells of domination by each Old Firm club, the longest run of 9-in-a-row being first set by Celtic between [[1966–67 in Scottish football|1966]] and [[1973–74 in Scottish football|1974]], matched by Rangers between [[1988–89 in Scottish football|1989]] and [[1996–97 in Scottish football|1997]].

On just five occasions since 1891 have neither of the Glasgow giants been the league winner nor the runner-up. This includes [[1964–65 in Scottish football|1964–65]], the only season in which both Rangers and Celtic failed to finish in the top three places. The Old Firm have finished 1st and 2nd 48 times overall. Between the [[History of Celtic F.C. (1994–present)#The Fergus McCann era (1994–1999)|resurgence of Celtic in the mid-1990s]] and the liquidation of Rangers in 2012, '1–2' finishes were recorded in all but one of 17 ''[[Scottish Premier League#Old Firm dominance|SPL]]-era'' seasons.

The longest sequence without an Old Firm title is three years between [[1982–83 in Scottish football|1983]] and [[1984–85 in Scottish football|1985]], while the longest unbroken run of championships between the two clubs began immediately afterwards and is ongoing: 33 seasons and counting since [[1985–86 in Scottish football|1986]] (overtaking a previous sequence of 27 years between [[1904–05 in Scottish football|1905]] and [[1930–31 in Scottish football|1931]]).

===Scottish Cup===
{{See also|List of Scottish Cup finals}}

Although the initial [[Scottish Cup]] was played in [[1873–74 Scottish Cup|1874]], 15 years before Celtic were formed, they have still won the competition more than any other club - 38 times, plus 18 runners-up - with Rangers not far behind on 33 (also 18 runners-up).

There have been 14 Old Firm finals, while there have been just 39 finals involving neither Rangers or Celtic, 17 of which were in the 1800s.

The longest run of Old Firm wins is 11 between [[1970–71 in Scottish football|1971]] and [[1980–81 in Scottish football|1981]].

==Women's football==
The Rangers–Celtic rivalry in women's football has existed only in the 21st century, with [[Rangers W.F.C.]] having formed in 2008, one year after the [[Celtic F.C. women's team]]. The footballing environment is also very different, with a third team in the city – [[Glasgow City F.C.]] – not merely competing in the same division as the more famous names and attracting a similar fanbase, but dominant over them in the [[Scottish Women's Premier League|domestic league]], with eleven consecutive titles up to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41960565|title=Glasgow City beat Hibs to wrap up 11th successive SWPL title |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=12 November 2017|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=womensep18&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45465408 |title=Celtic 0-0 Rangers: Old Firm sides goalless in women's game |work=BBC Sport |date=10 September 2018|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rangers have only finished above Celtic once ([[2014 Scottish Women's Premier League|2014]]), and neither club has won the [[Scottish Women's Cup]]; Celtic have lifted the [[Scottish Women's Premier League Cup|SWPL Cup]] on one occasion, in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/women/8679584.stm|title=Celtic secure women's League Cup|date=13 May 2010|accessdate=4 June 2018|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==

{{see also|LGBT history|Timeline of LGBT history}}

According to some authors{{who|date=October 2016}}, the global evolution of "pink capitalism" has been parallel to the development of [[modern capitalism]] in the West. Although historical evidence shows that [[Human sexuality|diversity of sexualities]] has always existed{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}, different periods in businesses' development targeted at the [[LGBTI community]], which have contributed to the construction of diverse sexual identities, can be distinguished{{when|date=October 2016}}.&lt;ref name="warped"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jmk.sagepub.com/content/22/1/86.short Out in the Market: A History of the Gay Market Segment in the United States.] Journal of Macromarketing.

===Underground phase===

[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-1983-0121-500,_Berlin,_Bar_"Eldorado".jpg|thumb|300px|LGBT Club [[Eldorado (Berlin)|Eldorado]] in Berlin during the 1920s.]]

Since the last decades of the 19th century, bars, cabarets, brothels, and even some [[List of LGBT periodicals|magazines]] targeted specifically at the gay community have existed in cities across Europe and the United States. Although members of the [[LGBTI]] community were still often publicly persecuted, the creation of these businesses corresponded to the beginning of the [[LGBT social movements#LGBT movement emergence|first drive for LGBTQ rights]]. This first LGBT movement was disintegrated between the [[World War I|First]] and [[Second World War]]s and the rise of fascism in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29877871|title=Gay New York : gender, urban culture, and the makings of the gay male world, 1890-1940|last=George.|first=Chauncey,|date=1994|publisher=Basic Books|year=|isbn=9780465026210|location=New York|pages=331|oclc=29877871}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CapitalismGayIdentity"/&gt;

===Community-building phase===

After the Second World War, [[Western culture]] was influenced by the [[homophobia]] of fascism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Herzog |first1= Dagmar |year=2007|title= Sex after Fascism: Memory and Morality in Twentieth-Century Germany |url= https://books.google.es/books?id=uapQAQAAQBAJ |publisher= Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-11702-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although LGBTI consumption remained [[Social exclusion|marginal]], during this time various [[homophile]] associations were created to seek positive assessment of homosexuality by society through meetings, publications, or charity parties.{{clarify|date=October 2016}} These associations opposed behaviors associated with homosexuals deemed marginal and [[perversion|perverted]], such as [[promiscuity]], [[cruising for sex|cruising]], prostitution, [[gay sauna|saunas]], and [[Pornographic magazine#Gay magazines|erotic magazines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Stein |first1= Marc |year=2012|chapter= Homophile activism, 1940 – 69|title= Rethinking the Gay and Lesbian Movement |url= https://books.google.es/books?id=jA8l8EYcnHsC |publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-87409-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-france.net/rude/2005conference/Sibalis2.pdf Gay Liberation Comes to France: The Front Homosexuel d’Action Révolutionnaire (FHAR)] French history and civilization. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integration in media culture phase===

[[File:Stonewall_Inn_1969.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Stonewall Inn]] in 1969.]]

The [[Stonewall riots]] of 1969 marked the beginning of the LGBT [[Gay liberation|liberation movement]], characterized by increased public visibility of homosexuality, the aim of [[decriminalization|decriminalizing]] homosexuality, and increased social and political integration. The movement resulted in a negative social response, in part driven by the [[HIV/AIDS pandemic]], which in turn led to the development of the [[queer]] movement by discriminated gay groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.tercerainformacion.es/spip.php?article2427 Revolución Queer en el Madrid de los 90.] Tercera Información. 26 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, the discrimination of the gay community diminished, broadening LGBT people's access to formerly [[heteronormativity|heteronormative]] jobs. This resulted in increased [[purchasing power]] for the LGBT community, or the creation of "[[pink money]]". Homosexuals in particular represented a large portion of this purchasing power. The trend is closely related to that of [[DINK (acronym)|DINKs]], couples with two incomes and no children.&lt;ref name ="cashing"/&gt;

These processes are especially evident in the dynamics of [[gay neighborhoods]], which attracted LGBT people{{when|date=October 2016}} with their affordability and the social security provided by living with other [[sexual minorities]]. These neighborhoods, after decreasing social [[Social stigma|stigma]] made them "[[trendy]]", then gradually underwent the [[gentrification]] process. Rising prices expelled the LGBT population that could not afford the new expenses{{clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jan/13/end-of-gaytrification-cities-lgbt-communities-gentrification-gay-villages The 'gaytrification' effect: why gay neighbourhoods are being priced out.] The Guardian. 13 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.greenleft.org.au/node/20645 'Pink capitalism' can't avoid the rules.] Green Left. 2 February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; An increasingly specialized market developed around LGBTI community in parallel with these other events. This market specifically serving the needs of the LGBTI community by selling services and products exclusively designed to meet their needs. Different companies and firms in turn began incorporating the defense of LGBT rights into their company policies and [[codes of conduct]], and even financing [[LGBT events]].&lt;ref name="fefa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="josue"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="cashing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/40404230 Queer Anti-Capitalism: What's Left of Lesbian and Gay Liberation?] Guilford Press. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

This kind of sociosexual relations appraisement is characteristic of gay modelling, which has its origin in the companies' new formation of a concentrated sexual market through rainbow capitalism.
{{Quote|In Spain, neither virile redefinition of homosexuality, nor gay model spreading, were made from the active homosexual movement of the time. [...] The penetration of the new model is carried out through private channels: by entrepreneurs who mimetically reproduce gay institutions already present in other countries [...] Institutionalization of homosexual universe "implies a search for efficiency and economy which involves, at the same time, maximizing efficiency (expressed quantitatively in number of partners and orgasms) and minimizing costs (waste of time and rejection of proposals)".&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.persee.fr/docAsPDF/comm_0588-8018_1982_num_35_1_1521.pdf L'homosexualité masculine, ou le bonheur dans le ghetto?] Persee. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; |''The gay model''. ''Pink society''. p. 82-84&lt;ref name="pinksociety"/&gt;}}

==Mechanisms==

Although it is likely that without the [[legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]] given by the capitalist model of consumption some [[civil and political rights]] would not have been achieved, the acquisition of these has come at the expense of the integration of LGBT people in a heteronormative consumerist framework.&lt;ref name ="cashing"/&gt; In this sense, pink capitalism is similar to [[patriarchal]] [[postfordism|postfordist]] capitalism, which has promoted the integration of women into [[productive labour]] while at the same time stimulating the incorporation of men to [[reproductive labor]].&lt;ref name="CapitalismGayIdentity"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "josue "/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.eldiario.es/economia/engano-trabajo-asalariado-liberar-mujeres_0_262823964.html "Es un engaño que el trabajo asalariado sea la clave para liberar a las mujeres".

===From sexual liberation to the gay male ideal===
Some argue that [[capitalist society]] has not accepted all sexually-diverse people equally and a greater [[toleration|social tolerance]] exists if LGBTI people have greater access to [[resources]], tying discussions of [[sexual identity]] to discussions of [[gender]], [[ethnicity]], [[Disability|ability]], and social [[Class discrimination|class]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pink-scare.blogspot.com.es/2012/06/gender-sexuality-and-capitalism.html Gender, Sexuality and Capitalism.] Pink Scare. 13 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://foucault.info/pst/az-cf-72725-900147912 Capitalism and Heterosexism: Judith Butler &amp; Nancy Fraser.] Foucault.info. 11 July 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics maintain that only gay, [[cisgender]], [[Western culture|western]], [[Disability|able-bodied]], [[White people|white]], urban, and [[Middle class|middle-]] or [[upper class|upperclass]] men tend to be accepted into the social context of consumption.&lt;ref name ="cashing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/07/02/tentaciones/1435839831_340586.html ¿Y qué pasa con las lesbianas?] El País. 2 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{gl}} [http://praza.gal/movementos-sociais/11617/as-persoas-lgtbi-que-vivimos-no-rural-somos-vistas-como-exoticas-ou-se-nos-ignora-ou-se-nos-ridiculiza/ "As persoas LGTBI que vivimos no rural somos vistas como exóticas.

{{Quote|In the pre-gay period, youth is worth of sexual exchange, but the elderly homosexuals were not stigmatized. With the extension of gay model and institutionalization that this entails, a sex market is formed where one of the most appreciated goods for sexual intercourse, as well as virility, is youth. The overvaluation of youth imposed by the gay style involves a underestimation of the mature adult male.|''The gay model''. ''Pink society''. p. 93&lt;ref name="pinksociety"/&gt;}}

===Symbolic and material rights===

[[File:Same-sex marriage map Europe detailed.svg|thumb|300px|Symbolic rights of [[non-heterosexual]] [[Couple (relationship)|couples]] in Europe:
{{Legend|#002255|Equal marriage}}
{{Legend|#0066FF|Civil union}}
{{Legend|#37F5FF|Foreign recognition}}
{{Legend|#CCCCCC|No recognition}}
{{Legend|#D40000|Equal marriage forbidden by constitution}}
]]

While rainbow capitalism has resulted in the achievement of some symbolic rights (such as [[Same-sex marriage|equal marriage]] or recognition of [[gender identity]]), these rights are subordinated to the people's [[resources]], income, and [[social position]].&lt;ref name="david"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Homonormativizacion"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "josue "/&gt;

In this regard, the trend the [[gay movement]] has not defined the [[political agenda]], but instead has adapted [[heteropatriarchy|heteropatriarchal]] and [[heteronormativity|heteronormative]] capitalism into a new form of patriarchal capitalism. This new capitalism incorporates the social vision of family, [[property]], [[Human body|body]], economic organization, and [[sexual experience]] from the heterosexual community. It has struggled for equal marriage, without questioning the concept of marriage, making the fight for equal marriage a goal of the LGBT movement that makes it seem there is nothing else to fight for.&lt;ref name="warped"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fefa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Homonormativizacion"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "josue "/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christiaan-rapcewicz/homonormativity-homonatio_b_6889606.html Homonormativity, Homonationalism and the Other 'Other'.] Huffington Post. 19 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and LGBTI movement===

Although the first political movements advocating sexual freedoms (like [[Queer anarchism]]) fell within the [[Far-left politics|radical left]], LGBT claims have only belatedly been integrated into the more moderate left political struggle – largely a result of rainbow capitalism.&lt;ref name="fefa"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "josue "/&gt;&lt;ref name="out"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.cawn.org/assets/Violencias%20Interseccionales.pdf Violencias interseccionales.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4730">A '''''shtadlan''''' ({{lang-he-n|שְׁתַדְּלָן}}, {{IPA-he|ʃtadˈlan|IPA}}; {{lang-yi|[[wikt:שתּדלן#Yiddish|שתּדלן]]}}, {{IPA-yi|ˈʃtadln̩|IPA}}) was an intercessor for a local [[History of the Jews in Europe|European Jewish]] community.  They represented the interests of the community, especially those of a town's [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|ghetto]], and worked as a "lobbyist" negotiating with the authorities holding power for the safety and benefit of Jews. The process of Jewish intercession is known as ''shtadlanus'' ({{lang-yi|[[wikt:שתּדלנות#Yiddish|שתּדלנות]]}}).

Shtadlanim (plural of shtadlan) relied on many tactics to intercede on the behalf of the Jewish community. These included emotional appeals, such as begging, rational appeals such as trying to implement charters or decrees, and also gifts of money or other goods to gain favor. Elyakim Zelig from Jampol, reported specifically on the need to beg for the Pope’s favor during a mission to Rome in 1757, in which he tried to gain support for defending Jews against [[blood libel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Shtadlan of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth: Noble Advocate or Unbridled Opportunist?|last=Ury|first=Scott|publisher=Oxford|year=2002|isbn=|location=Portland, Oregon|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, a Jewish community (''[[Qahal#In Poland-Lithuania|qahal]]'') governed its own internal affairs. The interactions with the outside society, such as [[tax]] collection and enforcement of various restrictions and compulsions imposed on the community, were arranged by an internal governing board.

The ''shtadlan'' emerged to prominence in 17th century Europe, with the rise of [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]], as an intermediator between the resident Jewish community and the monarchical government in control of the region. The position was appointed by the government, and could even be named as a royal official. Although he officially represented the Jewish community only, the ''shtadlan'' became a tool of the government.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Shtadlan played large roles in the Jewish communities, especially in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. One prominent shtadlan was Barukh ben David Yavan born in the early 1700s. Yavan was instrumental in many secret missions between the king of Poland, Augustus III and Frederick II of Prussia, helping to end the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. Yavan was also in contact with a papal nuncio in Warsaw allowing him to save many Talmuds after the Kamieniec disputation that led to most Talmuds being burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Barukh_ben_David_Yavan|title=YIVO {{!}} Barukh ben David Yavan|website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob Teitel, born in 1851 under czarist Russian rule, is another example of an influential shtadlan. After a pogrom began in the city of Saratov, he used his connection to the regional governor to stop anti-Jewish actions from continuing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz|first=Jacob|year=2000|title=A Portrait of a Russian-Jewish Shtadlan: Jacob Teitel's Social Solution|url=|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies 18|volume=no. 3: 1|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 19th century, the use of the press and public opinion as leverage for ''shtadlanus'' activity became the most important change in the work of the shadlan, becoming closely associated with relief efforts for victims of [[pogroms]] in Russia as well as the early foundings of [[Political Zionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Francois Guesnet, [http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/cajs/tradition/toc.html Jewish political culture between East and West: Isaak Ruelf and the Transformations of intercession (shtadlanus) in the 19th century.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, ''shtadlanim'' were seen as great protectors of Jewish communities, and received  [[Wiktionary:approbation|approbation]] from the communities' governing Jewish religious authorities.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Tosafot Yom Tov]] on [[Pirkei Avos]] 2:3 where Rabbi [[Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller]] compares those who work on behalf of the community to intercede with the ruling power to the likes of [[Mordecai]] in the [[Book of Esther]] and to Rabbi [[Judah HaNasi]], codifier of the [[Mishna]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sybil Morrison''' (2 January 1893 – 26 April 1984) was a British [[pacifist]] and a [[suffragette|suffragist]] as well as being active with several other radical causes.

As a young and enthusiastic suffragist, Morrison was persuaded by [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] that she was too young to go to prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fredsakademiet.dk/ordbog/mord/m149.htm  Danish Peace Academy]&lt;/ref&gt;  During World War I she began in 1916 to drive ambulances in London, and attributed her decision to become a pacifist to the sight of a [[Zeppelin]] being shot down over [[Potters Bar]]. ''In the streets of London, ordinary, decent people were clapping and cheering and dancing as though at a play or a circus……..I suddenly saw that war made yet another impact on human beings; it deprived them of their humanity. I became a pacifist then and nothing has happened since to alter my conviction that war is a crime against God and humanity.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilpf.int.ch/PDF/kaycamppdf/sybilmorrison.pdf Kay Camp, “Listen to the Women for a change”. WILPF]&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrison became in 1936 one of the first women members of the [[Peace Pledge Union]] (PPU), a British pacifist organisation and UK section of [[War Resisters International]] (WRI).  She served as a Campaign Organiser and Chair and wrote the first history of the PPU.&lt;ref&gt;Sybil Morrison "I Renounce War: The story of the Peace Pledge Union" Sheppard Press, London 1962&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 she spent a month in [[Holloway Prison]], having spoken against the war at London's [[Speakers' Corner]]. Morrison was an active member of the Women's International League for Peace &amp; Freedom (WILPF), being at one stage the Chair of its British branch.

Sybil Morrison was secretary of the short-lived Women's Peace Campaign, set up by the PPU at the end of 1939. It had been hoped to obtain the signatures of one million women against the Second World War but as Morrison admitted: ''The invasion of Scandinavia has, of course, made it much more difficult now to approach people about signing an appeal for negotiations because opinion is hardening against the pacifist.'' The Campaign was doomed after the surrender of the French in June, 1940 but the collapse may also have had something to do with the opposition of [[John Middleton Murry]], editor of [[Peace News]]. Murry was described as having a "frightful" attitude towards women and was not at all supportive of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vera Brittain]], "Women and Peace" Peace Pledge Union, London [http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/vera_women2.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrison was the Organising Secretary and Chair of the [[Six Point Group]] (c.1948-1950). The Group campaigned for legislation on assault against children, on support for widows, on legislation in support of unmarried mothers, and on issues of equal rights and equal pay. Another member of the Group was [[Dora Russell]], second wife of [[Bertrand Russell]]. Morrison was also active with the [[Howard League for Penal Reform]] and the [[National Peace Council]]. She was a vice-president of the [[Fellowship Party]], a small British political party that attracted many peace activists.

She was a close friend of leading peace activists [[Donald Soper]] and [[Fenner Brockway]], and of the pacifist actress [[Sybil Thorndike]] - they each referred to 'the other Sybil'. She was a lesbian who was once described as ''the most famous dyke in London''.&lt;ref&gt;Danish Peace Academy op cit&lt;/ref&gt; For the last few years of her life she shared a house with [[Myrtle Solomon]], who was the general secretary of the Peace Pledge Union and later the chair of WRI. In the 1930s she had a relationship with another suffragist, [[Dorothy Evans]], which was considered shocking at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlcs.org.uk/FamousONLA/Dorothy_Evans2.php  Olivia Beecham “Dorothy Evans – Suffragette”]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other people with whom Sybil worked included [[Vera Brittain]], [[Alex Comfort]], [[Laurence Housman]], [[Hugh Brock]], and [[Kathleen Lonsdale]] and many other leading individuals in radical politics during much of the 20th century. Even towards the end of her life she took an active interest in politics, turning up at the beginning of an anti [[Falklands War]] march.

The '''Tehran Peace Museum''' is a  member of the [[International Network of Museums for Peace]]. The main objective of the museum is to promote a culture of peace through raising awareness about the devastating consequences of war, with a focus on the health and environmental impacts of [[chemical weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Christian Science Monitor |title=Iran's Peace Museum: the reality vs. the glories of war |date=24 Dec 2007 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1224/p01s03-wome.html?page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently housed in a building donated by the municipality of Tehran within the historic City Park, the Tehran Peace Museum is as much an interactive peace center as a museum.

On June 29, 2007, a memorial for the poison gas victims of the [[Iran–Iraq War]] (1980–88), along with a Peace Museum, was completed in a park in Tehran, capital of [[Iran]]. These facilities were established by the Society for Chemical Weapons Victims Support (an Iranian NGO), the city of [[Tehran]], some other NGOs, and individuals and groups in [[Hiroshima]].

The museum coordinates a peace education program that holds workshops on humanitarian law, disarmament, tolerance, and peace education. At the same time, it hosts conferences on the culture of peace, reconciliation, international humanitarian law, disarmament, and peace advocacy.

Additionally, the museum houses a documentary studio that provides a workspace wherein the individual stories of victims of warfare can be captured and archived for the historical record. The museum’s peace library includes a collection of literature spanning topics from international law to the implementation of peace to oral histories of veterans and victims of war. The 3D [[Holographic image]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are exhibited here. They have been made from the portraits of [[Iran–Iraq War]]'s [[Martyr]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. They designed by [[Hesam Bani-Eghbal]] and his team on [[Hesam Animation Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hamshahrionline.ir/details/273663|title=گپی با دکتر حسام بنی‌اقبال؛ طراح چهره‌های سه بعدی باغ موزه دفاع مقدس|website=www.hamshahrionline.ir|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Permanent and rotating peace-related art exhibitions, displaying the work of amateur international and Iranian artists and children's drawings, are also housed in the museum complex. Finally, the Iranian secretariat for the international organization [[Mayors for Peace]] is housed in the Tehran Peace Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/mediacenter_d/w_museum/20081017175408738_en.html Shahriar Khateri, "The Tehran Peace Museum (Iran)", Peace Museums of the World, October 17, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding the Iranian Peace Museum Movement==
Its founding began with a conversation between the founders of the Tehran-based Society for Chemical Weapons Victims Support (SCWVS) and a coordinator for the International Peace Museums Network. This, as well as a visit to Hiroshima, Japan by members of SCWVS, fed into the desire for a museum in Tehran.

It was in Hiroshima where the suffering from atomic arms was able to convert most powerfully into a drive for peace manifested via a peace museum. This ability to use the intense suffering of war to highlight the need for peace made the Tehran Peace Museum’s founders realize Iran's parallel suffering from chemical arms and the need for a parallel drive for peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daytonpeacemuseum.net/TEHRAN%20PEACE%20MUSEUM%20INTRO.pdf "The Background of the Tehran Peace Museum".]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focus on survivor involvement==
While visiting [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]], the founders of the Tehran Peace Museum realized the necessity of involving the victims of war in the creation of the museum. Only these individuals could provide credible accounts of the harsh realities of war and their correlating desire for peace. The most moving, enthusiastic, and relevant of these war survivors emerged as the Iranian victims of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s chemical weapons attacks, the majority of whom were already in contact with SCWVS. This group of victims has proven to be extremely passionate about sharing their stories and serving as living monuments to the atrocities of war.

==Opening ceremony of the new building==
On June 29, 2011, concurrent with the anniversary of the gas attack on the city of [[Sardasht, West Azerbaijan|Sardasht]] in 1987 and the Day of Campaign against Chemical Weapons, the new building of the Tehran Peace Museum was officially opened for public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=IRIB |title=Tehran peace museum to open|date=27 June 2011 |url=http://english.irib.ir/radioculture/news/news/item/78226-tehran-peace-museum-to-open}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the ceremony, a number of guests from different countries, including the director of Hiroshima peace museum,&lt;ref&gt;http://en.tehran.ir/ViewArticle/tabid/77/ArticleId/49/Tehran-Hosts-Hiroshima-Peace-and-Friendship-Delegation.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; a delegation representing the survivors of Hiroshima atomic bombing, survivors of chemical weapons attack from [[Halabja]], Northern Iraq, as well many Iranian activists and war veterans attended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumsforpeace.org/INMP_newsletter_2.pdf ''International Network of Museums for Peace Newsletter'' no 02, November 2011.]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some recent activities==
An observance of the International Day of Remembrance for all victims of chemical warfare was held in the Tehran Peace Museum on Sunday, April 29, 2012. Many participants attended the event, including survivors of chemical warfare, representatives of international organizations, academics, journalists, and others.

In the memorial ceremony, messages of the UN Secretary General and the OPCW (Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) Director General were delivered.

Other parts of the program included a statement by a representative of the Iranian victims of chemical warfare, music performance, and the planting of olive trees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unic-ir.org/ep2unic.php?pg=110 United Nations Information Center - Tehran.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22799">'''Teleadministration''' is based on the concept that documents in electronic format have legal value. Administrative informatics is not new, but for many years it was merely Information Technology applied to legal documents, that is, the reproduction of paper-based legal documents into electronic file systems. Instead, Teleadministration turns this approach into its head. It is based on research conducted in 1978, the year when, at a conference promoted by the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]], [[:it:Giovanni Duni|Giovanni Duni]] launched the then-futuristic idea that an electronic document could have legal value.&lt;ref&gt;1. Duni, G., L'utilizzabilità delle tecniche elettroniche nell'emanazione degli atti e nei procedimenti amministrativi. Spunto per una teoria dell'atto amministrativo emanato nella forma elettronica, in "Rivista amm. della Repubblica italiana", 1978, pag.407 ss.&lt;/ref&gt; 1978 was also the year in which the first research on digital signatures ([[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]])&lt;ref&gt;2. Rivest, Shamir e [[Leonard Adleman|Adleman]], A method for obtaining digital signature and public key cryptosystems, in Communications of the ACM, vol. 21, febbraio 1978, 120-126. This research referred to the asymmetric encryption technology (Diffie and Hellman, New directions in Cryptography, in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, November 1976, 644 ss. Diffie and Hellman’s research was disseminated in Italy by  Gardner, “Un nuovo tipo di cifrario che richiederebbe milioni di anni per essere decifrato”, in Le Scienze, December 1977, 126 ss.), who added the regulation for issuing the keys and the public certification process associated to them.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in the United States, yet it would take more than twenty-five years for jurists and mathematicians to start working together.&lt;ref&gt;3. The first application of the research by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman was the 1995 Utah Code, § from 46-3-101 to 46-3-504 (Enacted by l. 1995, ch. 61). The Utah code was analysed in the brilliant dissertation written by Francesca Flora, Evoluzione della informatica nel sistema di governo degli Stati Uniti d’America (Cagliari, dept. Of Politiacl Science, November 1996). For application at the federal level one had to wait until 1998: US Senate, S. 1594, Digital Signature and Electronic Authentication Law (SEAL) of 1998. — US House of Representatives, H.R. 3472, Digital Signature and Electronic Authentication Law (SEAL) of 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, and even before 1978, IT helped [[Public Administration]] but kept a “safe distance”, assuming that the ‘sacred nature’ of the Law demanded the use of pen and paper. Information Technology merely managed and filed copies of legal documents: it was known as “parallel IT”,&lt;ref&gt;4. Duni, G., Amministrazione digitale, Voce della Enciclopedia del diritto, Annali, I, Milano 2007, p. 13-49.&lt;/ref&gt; since it was an accessory to the activity with formal value, the one based on pen and paper.

Thus, the logical, legal and material premise of Teleadministration is the conferment of legal value to IT documents.

== Origins and terminology  ==
In Italy, the linguistic expression &lt;ref&gt;5. [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/teleamministrazione_(Lessico-del-XXI-Secolo) Teleamministrazione, Lessico del XXI secolo], Treccani&lt;/ref&gt; teleamministrazione was first used in 1991 at the Roman ‘La Sapienza’ university, during a conference organised by the Court of Cassation,&lt;ref&gt;6. Duni, G., Il progetto nazionale di teleamministrazione pubblica, in “L’informatica giuridica e il Ced della Corte di Cassazione”, proceedings of the conference held at the Univ. of Rome “La Sapienza”, 27-29 Nov. 1991, Milan 1992, p. 87 ss.&lt;/ref&gt; in which it was said that: «the new system of administrative information technology is called “teleadministration” because all the work of the [[Public Administration]] will be carried out through devices, that could also be computers, linked to the central server through a network.» Teleadministration was indeed considered a type of teleworking.&lt;ref&gt;7. Applicazioni della multimedialità nella P.A.: teleamministrazione e telelavoro”, in Funzione Pubblica, special issue “I convegni di FORUM P.A. ’96”, volume I, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Teleadministration, amministrative procedures become electronic administrative procedures and, more specifically, those that are initiated by a party realize the electronic One Stop Shop.

== The fundamentals of teleadministration ==
In the decades from 1970 to 1990, the [[Supreme Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]] was at the core of research on the relationship between IT and Law, organising international conferences every five years on the topic. The 1993 international conference featured the fundamentals of teleadministration, providing the details of the administrative systems behind the One Stop Shop concept:&lt;ref&gt;8. Duni, G., presentation at the 5th International Congress at the Court of Cassation on “IT and Legal Activity” Rome, 3–7 May 1993, I.P.Z.S. - Libreria dello Stato, 1994, II, p. 381 ss.&lt;/ref&gt;
# A citizen presents his/her claim to one administration, which then manages the entire procedure.
# A single “administrative file” is created, no matter how many different administrations may be involved.
# For both internal and external stages in an administrative procedure, a "warning signal" is sent telematically to the relevant office where the next stage is due, the employee in that office then becomes responsible for that phase of the procedure.
# Any information concerning records already held by public administration is accessed telematically, without involving the citizen. 
# The (electronic) signature identifies the identity of the operator through sophisticated techniques.
# The original of an administrative act is electronic and is therefore always available telematically to any administration that may need it. 
# The presence of an increasing amount of on-line data will necessitate greater use of automatic data processing in decision-making.
# Saving data on multiple memory locations will guarantee the safekeeping of the acts. 
# Statistical data will be available in real time and under multiple profiles, with great benefits for top level decision-making.
# Private citizens can obtain paper copies of the electronic acts.
It should be noted that the 5th fundamental mentions electronic rather than digital signatures.  This is because, in the jurists’ domain, digital signatures were not yet known. The generic reference to the electronic signature is however valid, and its general nature is actually suitable for the rules contained six years later in the Directive 1999/93/EC.
As we will see, the Directive refers in particular to all procedures initiated by private citizens, but the system remains valid for all procedures initiated by the administration offices as well.

== Acknowledgement of the principles in current law ==
The legally accepted form of acts and documents evolved according to the following stages:
# Acts only exist in paper form
# Acts in electronic format are a possible option
# Electronic format is compulsory, safe for a few exceptions
In Italy, Phase 2 was launched by Art 15, para, 2,  Law N. 59 of 15 March 1997, (the so-called ‘Bassanini 1’ law: it established the legal value of electronic documents, while regulations would establish the authentication criteria). The EC intervened later with its Directive 1999/93/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] of 13 December 1999 (Transposed by Law Decree N.10 of 23 January 2002), which imposes an obligation on Member States to give legal value to documents with digital signatures (not directly named as such, but all their features are described in the directive). It also establishes that electronic documents should not be rejected a priori, hence opening to a range of different solutions to establish the authorship of a document (the so-called ‘weak signatures’).

The 1993 Directive was revoked and absorbed (for reasons of legal certainty and clarity) by Regulation 910/2014 of the European Parliament and Council of 23 July 2014 (also known as eIDAS regulation) in the OJEU 28 August 2014, which did not renege on the principle of also accepting the so-called ‘weak signatures’.
In Italy, The move to Phase 3 was established by Art.40 of Legislative sl. Decree N.82 of 7 March 2007, Code of Digital Administration (CAD), entitled “Creation of electronic documents”, which states: “Public Administrations make the original copy of their documents with electronic means, according to the provisions of the present Code and the technical specifications of Article 71”. Exceptions are extremely rare: Comma 3 states: by means of appropriate regulations…. , proposed by the delegated Ministers for Public Functions, Innovation and Technology and the Minister for Cultural Heritage and Activities, the categories of administrative documents that can be created on paper in original are identified, having regard to the special historical and archive value they will have by nature” (think, for example, of the resignation of a President of the Republic).

Unfortunately, national administrations are ignoring this provision, and today it is only private companies that are no longer allowed paper-based communication with public administrations (Art. N. 5 bis of the CAD and D.P.C.M. 22 July 2011); compulsory electronic invoicing was added on 31 March 2015 by Law N. 44 of 24 December 2007, Art. N. 1, para 209-214 implemented by Ministerial  Decree N.55 of 3 April 2013, further clarified by Ministerial circular N.1 of 9 March 2015.
The modernisation of procedures was also touched by Presidential Decree N. 447 of 20 October 1998 (creation of the One Stop Shop, but only for production activities, and paper based), while interest for a telematic procedure only began with Legislative Decree N. 82 of 7 March 2005, CAD, which is not as relevant in its first version but was later modified by several interventions, particularly Legislative Decree N. 335 of 10 December 2013.

European sources are also essential. The EC, and later the European Union, have undertaken a wide range of actions on e-government: one of the most important was the launch of the IDABC programme (and financing) for Interoperable Delivery of European eGovernment Services to public Administrations, Business and Citizens, via Decision 2004/387/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 21 April 2004. However, the ultimate acknowledgement of the principles of teleadministration, with the telematic One Stop Shop, is contained in the Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 12 December 2006, on the Internal market for services, which provides for Member States to set up an electronic One Stop Shop in the wide field of administrative procedures.

== Teleadministration and the ‘star’ procedure ==
This article is not meant to argue the great effect that teleadministration has on the efficiency of administrative activity, as we assume that the reader is fully aware that, once paper based documents are abandoned, the real-time flow of documents greatly improves time management and responsibility of the single offices/ operators, while direct online access improves transparency. Rather, this paragraph wants to emphasize how teleadministration promotes maximum usage of the “star procedure”, known and researched in Germany as “Sternverfahren”. This procedure, an alternative to the sequential procedure, which has by nature longer head times, in the paper-based world would require making several copies of the administrative file (which can be extremely voluminous) for each office and each administration that needs to express an opinion or issue an authorisation. With the One Stop Shop, the administration initiating the process is charged with this task. Electronic files clearly provide evident benefits for these procedures, since all involved administrations can directly and simultaneously access the file, view the part they need to evaluate and add their opinion or authorisation directly, using a star-shaped scheme.

== Assessing the actual acceptance of teleadministration in current law and real life ==
As a scientific proposition, teleadministration sketched the system of telematic administrative procedures well ahead of the law, and particularly the electronic One Stop Shop concept. Both concepts are based on the dematerialisation of documents and on telematic administrative work.

The concept of documents’ dematerialisation,&lt;ref&gt;9. According to some commentators “dematerialization” is not the appropriate term for documents that are created in electronic form, but rather for those that are created in paper form and are later converted in digital format. Though conceptually correct, this observation ignores the fact that the expression now is generally understood to mean any “form that does without the material presence of paper, from the creation of the document”&lt;/ref&gt; in existence since 1978 as a scientific notion,&lt;ref&gt;10. See note. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; was first embraced in Italy (Law N. 59 of 15 March 1997, Art. 15, para 2) and later by the E.C. in Directive 1999/93/EC.

Once the principle that an electronic document can have legal value was accepted, it was possible to deal with its management within a telematic procedure.
As mentioned, configuring this procedure within the rules of teleadministration is today accepted in both European and Italian laws. European laws also provide quite a detailed description of the electronic One Stop Shop, with rules that fit nicely within the scientific rules of teleadministration; their main limitation is that they were specifically designed for the free circulation of services within Europe, and hence for the procedures these require. It is the above-mentioned 1996/123/EC Directive, whose Art.6 establishes the One Stop Shop and Art. 8 provides that it should be managed “remotely and electronically”, leaving further details to the Commission. And indeed the Commission, with its Decision of 16 October 2009, provided a number of measures to facilitate the use of electronic procedures through the “One Stop Shop” under Directive 2006/123/EC. These sources are clear and they apply to a wide-ranging sector: the problem is that any sector or procedure that is not related to the supply of services within the Union is not regulated, and Member States are therefore able to carry on with old-fashioned paper-based procedures.

In light of this limitation, a group of illustrious European Law academics, coordinated by Giovanni Duni, has drafted the most effective text for a Directive providing a universal system of telematic administrative procedure.&lt;ref&gt;11. The outcome of this collective research effort is the text for a draft Directive, that can be found on the CNR ITTIG journal  Informatica e diritto, Vol. XXI, 2012, N. 2, pp. 113-129: The telematic procedures in the European Union. Introducing a draft Directive, as well as  on line, with an Italian and an English language version of the draft on the site [http://www.teleamministrazione.it www.teleamministrazione.it]&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian sources are based on the Code of Digital Administration, the above-mentioned Law Decree N.82 of 7 March 2005 in its current version, following several modifications, which (if correctly interpreted and implemented) should make it compulsory for all public administrations to use teleadministration, thus making the telematic administrative procedure the default procedural method. Art. 14, the key provision, establishes that the proceeding administration creates an electronic file, to which all involved administrations can and should have access, and feed it with the acts of their competence. Private citizens can also access it under Law 241/90
Thus the electronic file is the technical and organizational specification of the telematic administrative procedure, as it is clear that its creation is an operative stage of the procedure and not simply a new filing system for the archives.

Art. 10 of the CAD appears at first to be at odds with this interpretation, since it establishes that the One Stop Shop for productive activities provides its services electronically but leaves doubts about the possibility that the back office activities could be still paper-based. However, if Art. 10 and Art. 41 are interpreted together, the only possible conclusion is that the former is a clarification of front office activities, but all the administrative activity is based on the general rule of electronic files, and therefore on the teleadministration and the One Stop Shop. 
Compared to European and Italian law, reality is somewhat behind. Eight years after Directive 1996/123/CE, there would be grounds for an infraction procedure against Italy. But since Italy enjoys the company of several other non-compliant Member States, they are all ‘safe’ for the time being.

Though the letter of the CAD may be not be respected, it seems very unlikely that this may determine the invalidity or nullity of the acts for violation of Art. 41(electronic file) or Art. 40 (statutory requirement of digital signature), because in front of a claim of this nature, the administrative judge would apply Artt. 21 septies and 21 octies of Law 241/90. The claimant should demonstrate that the use of the electronic format and electronic file would have led to a different outcome.

'''''Unintended Consequences''''' is a novel by [[John Ross (author)|John Ross]], first published in 1996 by Accurate Press.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=John |title=Unintended Consequences |date=Jan 1996 |publisher=Accurate Press |isbn=978-1-888118-04-9 |pages=863 |url=http://www.john-ross.net/faq.php |accessdate=2010-09-05 |location=St. Paul, Mn |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204021131/http://john-ross.net/faq.php |archivedate=2014-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story chronicles the history of the [[gun culture]], [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]], and [[gun control in the United States]] from the early 1900s through the late 1990s. Although clearly a work of [[fiction]], the story is heavily laced with historical fact, including historical figures who play minor supporting roles. The protagonist is very active in competitive [[shooting sports]], as is the author; so unusually detailed and intricate facts, figures and explanations of [[firearm]]s-related topics, ornament the narrative and drive the plot.

The cover has a picture of [[Lady Justice]] being assaulted by an [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] agent.

The book was listed by ''[[The New York Times]]''' Sunday Book Review as one of the most sought after out-of-print books of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=Sunday Book Review: A Reader's Hunting Guide |author=John Williams | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 14, 2014 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/books/review/a-readers-hunting-guide.html|accessdate=2014-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The story hinges upon the enactment and subsequent [[unintended consequence]]s of several important pieces of U.S. gun control legislation and regulation: the [[National Firearms Act]] of 1934, the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]], the [[Firearm Owners Protection Act]] of 1986, the Assault Weapons Importation Ban enacted by Presidential [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] in 1989 and the [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban]] of 1994.

Its thesis, as discussed in the ''Author's Note – A Warning and Disclaimer'' in the beginning of the book, is that enough bullying, by what is widely perceived as a hostile occupation government, will inevitably end in revolt if the occupied area is large enough and has a culture that is significantly different from the occupying state, and that this revolt will be undefeatable if the rebels use very [[Low tech|low-tech]] "[[leaderless resistance]]."

==Characters==
'''Henry Bowman''' is the principal character, although the story begins in 1906, long before Bowman's birth on January 10, 1953. The story is told primarily from his perspective when he is in his early forties. Bowman grows up in the [[St. Louis, Missouri]] area, where much of the story takes place. He is a trained [[geologist]], a self-taught expert [[marksman]], a [[firearm]]s, [[ammunition]], and [[self-defense]] authority, and a pilot. Bowman lives on a rural acreage near the [[St. Louis, Missouri]] metropolitan area. There is an abandoned stone [[quarry]] on his land which Bowman uses for recreational shooting. Bowman, in the novel, enjoys owning performance automobiles and driving at high speed on interstate highways. In one part of the novel, he races his hot-rodded GMC truck against a rival [[Porsche]], with Bowman winning, driving in excess of 140&amp;nbsp;mph to win. Bowman also has several [[Identity Theft|forged identities]] that he uses for various purposes in the novel

. Bowman is a proficient [[Skydiving|skydiver]].

'''Walter "Blackout" Bowman''' is Henry's father. A skilled pilot and [[U.S. Navy]] officer, he trained 437 naval aviators during [[World War II]], retiring at the rank of Lieutenant Commander. He represents the studious, responsible and thoughtful side of the younger Bowman. The author has stated that the elder Bowman is based on his own father.

'''Max Collins''' is Bowman's uncle. He is portrayed as a larger-than-life character who is an expert marksman, professional gambler and accomplished ladies' man. He served in the airborne troops of [[Normandy landings|D-Day]], and killed a [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German army]] officer in combat with his [[sniper rifle]]. In the novel, at a 1960s [[Nevada]] shooting competition, he bets on his nephew Henry's shooting, winning $10,000. He represents the adventurous, spontaneous and aggressive side of Henry Bowman. The author has stated that Collins is based on his own uncle.

'''Irwin Mann''' is a survivor of [[The Holocaust]] and the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], and a key participant in the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]. His inclusion in the story permits a study of the use of firearms by average citizens to repel an oppressive government and connects [[Nazi gun control]] measures to U.S. gun control efforts.

'''Ray Johnson''' is a [[New York City]] attorney, originally from Aspen, [[Colorado]], who moves to Africa in 1963 and becomes a big-game [[safari]] guide. His return to the U.S. in 1994 serves to illustrate how much U.S. gun owners' freedoms have been eroded, due to legislation and an executive order enacted during his absence.  At the airport, the customs officials attempt to confiscate an English [[double rifle]] worth some US$40,000, a Belgian [[FN FAL]] semi-automatic rifle, a [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] 2" Chief's Special revolver, and his hat which wears a leopard skin hat band. Ray calls his friend Henry, and Henry calls in a favor with a friend who is a high-ranking agent of Customs. Ray is allowed to keep his firearms and enter the United States.

'''Allen Kane''' is a major machine gun dealer who is Henry's lifelong friend. A major shift in the novel's plot occurs when Henry finds corrupt [[BATFE|ATF]] agents framing Allen, himself, and another firearms dealer. Allen aids and accompanies Henry in much of the novel.

'''Cindy Caswell''' is a victim of [[child abuse|childhood abuse]] and [[organized crime]] who becomes important in the freedom struggle as it develops. She is from [[Rolla, Missouri]]. She is abducted by [[American Mafia|mafia]] thugs during a trip to [[Chicago, Illinois]], who force her to become a sex slave for [[mafia]] bosses and leaders. After several years, she escapes and meets Henry Bowman at an [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meeting. She assassinates many pro-gun control and big-government politicians and legislators in the novel. The author has been criticized for creating an "adolescent fantasy" with this character. Ten years after writing the novel, Ross met Tammy Chapman, whose early life shares a resemblance to that of the fictional Caswell. Ross and Chapman now live together in St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.john-ross.net/cindy.php Author's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The novel's protagonist, Henry Bowman, shows an early proficiency with firearms, practicing whenever he can find the time. Encouraged by his father, he gathers an impressive firearms collection and gains extensive experience in piloting small aircraft. During college, Bowman is robbed, beaten, and sodomized by a rural [[gang]]. The incident nearly destroys him and causes him to become an [[alcoholic]] for a period.

While at a [[gun show]] in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]] with friend Allen Kane, Bowman publicly embarrasses an agent of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF), Wilson Blair. One of Blair's men was trying to trick and entrap a fellow [[firearms dealer]]. Blair takes the offense personally, and with the support of the ATF's director, begins to plan revenge. Several years later, Blair and subordinate agents of the ATF plan to frame Henry and his friends as terrorists, smugglers, and counterfeiters. They plan to plant "evidence" when the men are away on vacation. Unbeknownst to Blair, Bowman delays his departure at the last minute due to a work commitment, and is on a friend's property when the agents arrive. Bowman assumes the agents are burglars and engages in a gun battle with them, killing or capturing all and in the process discovering the truth about the raid.

Bowman realizes that his life has been irrevocably changed. He makes Blair record a video taped confession of his illegal actions, then kills Blair and disposes of all [[Forensic identification|forensic evidence]] of the agents' presence. Afterwards, he hunts down and kills Blair's remaining subordinates. Bowman and his closest friends begin to systematically kill ATF agents around the nation – whom Bowman views as supporting the infringement of citizen's constitutional rights, and abusing government powers – as well as politicians who had supported unconstitutional gun control legislation. Simultaneously Bowman releases the video tape of Blair to [[CNN]], which claims that Blair and his companions have had a change of heart, realize what they are doing is wrong, and are now dedicated to killing other ATF agents. Amidst the national search for Blair and company, Bowman continues to rack up the body count.

Eventually, as the ATF and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] are unable to effectively track down those responsible for the killings, the President of the United States is forced to give an address to the nation relating his intent to repeal the unconstitutional laws, including the [[National Firearms Act of 1934]] and [[Gun Control Act of 1968]].

== Reception ==
The novel sold over 60,000 copies of over four printings.&lt;ref name="John Ross.net FAQ"&gt;[http://john-ross.net/faq.php John Ross.net FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204021131/http://john-ross.net/faq.php |date=2014-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=October 2017}} After having been out of print for several years, a paperback edition was reissued in June, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accuratepress.net Publisher's website (Accurate Press)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The author's web site states that he is working on a shorter sequel that was originally scheduled for publication in 2006.  However, this sequel has not yet been released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://john-ross.net/faq.php Author's FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204021131/http://john-ross.net/faq.php |date=2014-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Timothy McVeigh controversy ===

[[Timothy McVeigh]] read the novel while awaiting his trial for the [[Oklahoma City bombing]]. He loved the book, and noted that if it had come out a few years earlier, he would have given serious consideration to using sniper attacks in a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]] against the government instead of bombing a federal building:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author1=Michel, Lou  |author2=Herbeck, Dan |lastauthoramp=yes |page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|If people say ''[[The Turner Diaries]]'' was my Bible, ''Unintended Consequences'' would be my [[New Testament]]. I think ''Unintended Consequences'' is a better book. It might have changed my whole plan of operation if I'd read that one first.}}

John Ross has posted a response to Timothy McVeigh's comments on his website:&lt;ref name="John Ross.net FAQ"/&gt;

{{quote|First of all, authors have no control over who decides to admire their work. Remember that when the FBI searched Unabomber [[Ted Kaczynski]]'s shack (after his brother turned him in), they found only a handful of personal items and just a single, well-read book. What was the one title that the Unabomber felt was so important it was his only reading material? ''[[Earth in the Balance]]'', by [[Al Gore]].}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="67034">'''Vaccination policy''' refers to the [[health policy]] a government adopts in relation to [[vaccination]].  Vaccinations are voluntary in some countries and mandatory in others, as part of their [[public health]] system.  Some governments pay all or part of the costs of vaccinations in a national [[vaccination schedule]].

==Goals of vaccination policies==

===Immunity and herd immunity===

Vaccination policies aim to produce immunity to [[vaccine-preventable diseases|preventable diseases]].  Besides individual protection from getting ill, some vaccination policies also aim to provide the community as a whole with [[herd immunity]]. Herd immunity refers to the idea that the pathogen will have trouble spreading when a significant part of the population has immunity against it. This protects those unable to get the vaccine due to medical conditions, such as immune disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/immunizations-policy-issues-overview.aspx|title=Immunizations Policy Issues Overview|first=National Conference of State|last=Legislatures|website=www.ncsl.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaccine-preventable diseases remain the most common cause of childhood mortality with an estimated three million deaths each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report

===Eradication of disease===
[[File:Saving Lives with SMS for Life.jpg|right|thumb|Malaria Clinic in Tanzania helped by [[Extreme Blue#Projects|SMS for Life]] program which organizes [[malaria vaccine]] delivery]]
With some vaccines, a goal of vaccination policies is to eradicate the disease – make it disappear from Earth altogether.  The [[World Health Organization]] coordinated the effort to eradicate [[smallpox]] globally through vaccination, the last naturally occurring case of smallpox was in Somalia in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/faq/en/|title=Frequently asked questions and answers on smallpox|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Endemic [[measles]], [[mumps]] and [[rubella]] have been eliminated through vaccination in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peltola H, Jokinen S, Paunio M, Hovi T, Davidkin I | title = Measles, mumps, and rubella in Finland: 25 years of a nationwide elimination programme | journal = The Lancet. Infectious Diseases | volume = 8 | issue = 12 | pages = 796–803 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19022194 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(08)70282-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO has targeted [[Polio eradication|polio for eradication]] by the year 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polioeradication.org/who-we-are/strategy/|title=GPEI-Strategy|website=polioeradication.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual versus group goals===

[[rational choice theory|Rational individuals]] will attempt to minimize the risk of illness, and will seek vaccination for themselves or their children if they perceive a high threat of disease and a low risk to vaccination. However, if a vaccination program successfully reduces the disease threat, it may reduce the perceived risk of disease enough so that an individual's optimal strategy is to encourage everyone but their family to be vaccinated, or (more generally) to refuse vaccination once vaccination rates reach a certain level, even if this level is below that optimal for the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fine PE, Clarkson JA | title = Individual versus public priorities in the determination of optimal vaccination policies | journal = American Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 124 | issue = 6 | pages = 1012–20 | date = December 1986 | pmid = 3096132 }}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a 2003 study found that a [[bioterrorist]] attack using [[smallpox]] would result in conditions where voluntary vaccination would be unlikely to reach the optimum level for the U.S. as a whole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bauch CT, Galvani AP, Earn DJ | title = Group interest versus self-interest in smallpox vaccination policy | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 18 | pages = 10564–7 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12920181 | pmc = 193525 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1731324100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2007 study found that severe [[influenza epidemic]]s cannot be prevented by voluntary vaccination without offering certain incentives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vardavas R, Breban R, Blower S | title = Can influenza epidemics be prevented by voluntary vaccination? | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = e85 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17480117 | pmc = 1864996 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030085 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Governments often allow exemptions to mandatory vaccinations for religious or philosophical reasons, but decreased rates of vaccination may cause loss of [[herd immunity]], substantially increasing risks even to vaccinated individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Compulsory vaccination==
{{further|Vaccine controversy}}

To eliminate the risk of disease outbreaks, at various times governments and other institutions established policies requiring vaccination. For example, an 1853 law required universal vaccination against smallpox in [[England]] and [[Wales]], with fines levied on people who did not comply.&lt;ref name="ElAmin"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Ethical Issues Concerning Vaccination Requirements | authors = El Amin AN, Parra MT, Kim-Farley R, Fielding JE | journal = Public Health Rev. | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–20 | url = http://www.publichealthreviews.eu/upload/pdf_files/11/00_El_Amin.pdf }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Jacobson v. Massachusetts]]'' (1905) that states have the authority to require vaccination against smallpox during a smallpox epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mariner WK, Annas GJ, Glantz LH | title = Jacobson v Massachusetts: it's not your great-great-grandfather's public health law | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 95 | issue = 4 | pages = 581–90 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15798113 | pmc = 1449224 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2004.055160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All U.S states require that children be vaccinated in order to attend school;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walkinshaw E | title = Mandatory vaccinations: The international landscape | journal = CMAJ | volume = 183 | issue = 16 | pages = E1167-8 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 21989473 | pmc = 3216445 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.109-3993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; only three states (Mississippi, West Virginia, and California) do not provide exemptions based on religious or philosophical beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vaccines.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=003597|title=State Vaccination Exemptions for Children Entering Public Schools - Vaccines - ProCon.org|website=vaccines.procon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few other countries also follow this practice. Compulsory vaccination greatly reduces infection rates for associated diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF03391666 |title=Ethical Issues Concerning Vaccination Requirements |journal=Public Health Reviews |volume=34 |year=2012 |last1=Amin |first1=Alvin Nelson El |last2=Parra |first2=Michelle T |last3=Kim-Farley |first3=Robert |last4=Fielding |first4=Jonathan E | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the nineteenth century, these policies stirred resistance from a variety of groups, collectively called [[anti-vaccinationist]]s, who objected on ethical, political, medical safety, [[vaccination and religion|religious]], and other grounds.&lt;ref name="Wolfe RM, Sharp LK 430–2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolfe RM, Sharp LK | title = Anti-vaccinationists past and present | journal = BMJ | volume = 325 | issue = 7361 | pages = 430–2 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12193361 | pmc = 1123944 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.325.7361.430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common objections included government intervention in personal matters or that proposed vaccinations were not sufficiently safe.&lt;ref name="Wolfe RM, Sharp LK 430–2"/&gt; Many modern vaccination policies allow exemptions for people with compromised immune systems, allergies to vaccination components, or strongly held objections.&lt;ref name="Salmon2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Salmon DA, Teret SP, MacIntyre CR, Salisbury D, Burgess MA, Halsey NA | title = Compulsory vaccination and conscientious or philosophical exemptions: past, present, and future | journal = Lancet | volume = 367 | issue = 9508 | pages = 436–42 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16458770 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68144-0 }}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 in the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], following an urban renewal program that displaced many poor, a government program of mandatory smallpox vaccination triggered the  [[Vaccine Revolt]], several days of rioting with considerable property damage and a number of deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0022216X00014784 |title='Living Worse and Costing More': Resistance and Riot in Rio de Janeiro, 1890–1917 |journal=Journal of Latin American Studies |volume=21 |pages=241 |year=2009 |last1=Meade |first1=Teresa | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compulsory vaccination is a difficult policy issue, requiring authorities to balance public health with individual liberty:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Vaccination is unique among de facto mandatory requirements in the modern era, requiring individuals to accept the injection of a medicine or medicinal agent into their bodies, and it has provoked a spirited opposition. This opposition began with the first vaccinations, has not ceased, and probably never will. From this realisation&lt;!-- Please don't change to "realization"; this is a direct quote. --&gt; arises a difficult issue: how should the mainstream medical authorities approach the anti-vaccination movement? A passive reaction could be construed as endangering the health of society, whereas a heavy-handed approach can threaten the values of individual liberty and freedom of expression that we cherish."&lt;ref name="Wolfe RM, Sharp LK 430–2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Investigation of different types of vaccination policy finds strong evidence that standing orders and allowing healthcare workers without prescription authority (such as nurses) to administer vaccines in defined circumstances increases vaccination rates, and sufficient evidence that requiring vaccinations before attending child care and school does so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Briss PA, Rodewald LE, Hinman AR, Shefer AM, Strikas RA, Bernier RR, Carande-Kulis VG, Yusuf HR, Ndiaye SM, Williams SM | title = Reviews of evidence regarding interventions to improve vaccination coverage in children, adolescents, and adults.

== Evaluating vaccination policy ==
'''Vaccines as a positive externality'''

==International Organizations==
In 2006, the World Health Organization and UNICEF created the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy (GIVS). This organization created a ten-year strategy with four main goals:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Immunization Vision and Strategy |url=http://www.who.int/immunization/givs/en/ |website=Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals |publisher=World Health Organization |date=1 December 2013 |access-date=24 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* to immunize more people against more diseases
* to introduce a range of newly available vaccines and technologies
* to integrate other critical health interventions with immunization
* to manage vaccination programmes within the context of global interdependence

The [[Global Vaccination Action Plan]] was created by the World Health Organization and endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2012. The plan which is set from 2011–2020 is intended to "strengthen routine immunization to meet vaccination coverage targets; accelerate control of vaccine-preventable diseases with polio eradication as the first milestone; introduce new and improved vaccines and spur research and development for the next generation of vaccines and technologies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Policies and history by country==

===Australia===
In an effort to boost vaccination rates in [[Australia]], the Australian government has decided that starting on 1 January 2016, certain benefits (such as the universal 'Family Allowance' welfare payments for parents of children) will no longer be available for conscientious objectors of vaccination; those with medical grounds for not vaccinating will continue to receive such benefits. The policy is supported by a majority of Australian parents as well as the [[Australian Medical Association]] (AMA) and [[Early Childhood Australia]]. In 2014, about 97 percent of children under 7 years have been vaccinated, though the number of conscientious objectors to vaccination has increased by 24,000 to 39,000 over the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

There were 5,000 cases of measles in 2017, up from 870 in 2016, 29% of all those in the European Union.

Latvia appears unique in that it compels health care providers to obtain the signatures of those who decline vaccination. Individuals have the right to refuse a vaccination, but if they do so, health providers have a duty to explain the health consequences.

Vaccines that are not mandatory are not publicly funded, so the cost for those must be borne by parents or employers, she adds. Funded vaccinations include tuberculosis, diphtheria, measles, hepatitis B, human papilloma virus for 12-year-old girls, and tick-borne encephalitis until age 18 in endemic areas and for orphans.

For example, children may receive the [[oral polio vaccine]] in Year One of [[primary school]] (about six or seven years of age), the [[Bacillus Calmette Guérin|BCG]] in Year Six, and the [[MMR vaccine|MMR]] in Form Three of [[secondary school]]. Therefore, most people have received their core vaccines by the time they finish secondary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report

===Nigeria===
In [[Nigeria]], the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), was introduced in 1978 to provide free immunization against polio, measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, tuberculosis, and yellow fever to Nigerian children less than 2 years old. This free immunization can be obtained at any primary health centre in the country. The vaccines are usually administered by a government health care worker. They also conduct routine vaccination visits in schools where all the children in a given school are vaccinated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report

Facing numerous minor polio epidemics, the Pakistani government has now ruled that the polio vaccination as mandatory and indisputable. In a statement from Pakistani Police Commissioner Riaz Khan Mehsud "There is no mercy, we have decided to deal with the refusal cases with iron hands.

According to a 2011 publication in ''[[CMAJ]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walkinshaw E | title = Mandatory vaccinations: The international landscape | journal = CMAJ | volume = 183 | issue = 16 | pages = E1167-8 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 21989473 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.109-3993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slovenia has one of the world's most aggressive and comprehensive vaccination programs. Its program is mandatory for nine designated diseases. Within the first three months of life, infants must be vaccinated for tuberculosis, tetanus, polio, pertussis, and Haemophilus influenza type B. Within 18 months, vaccines are required for measles, mumps and rubella, and finally, before a child starts school, the child must be vaccinated for hepatitis B. While a medical exemption request can be submitted to a committee, such an application for reasons of religion or conscience would not be acceptable. Failure to comply results in a fine and compliance rates top 95%, Kraigher says, adding that for nonmandatory vaccines, such as the one for human papilloma virus, coverage is below 50%.

Mandatory vaccination against measles was introduced in 1968 and since 1978, all children receive two doses of vaccine with a compliance rate of more than 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

All 50 states in the U.S. mandate immunizations for children in order to enroll in public school, but various exemptions are available depending on the state.

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) advises physicians to respect the refusal of parents to vaccinate their child after adequate discussion, unless the child is put at significant risk of harm (e.g., during an epidemic, or after a deep and contaminated puncture wound). Under such circumstances, the AAP states that parental refusal of immunization constitutes a form of medical neglect and should be reported to state [[child protective services]] agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diekema DS | title = Responding to parental refusals of immunization of children | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 115 | issue = 5 | pages = 1428–31 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15867060 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2005-0316 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Schools====
The United States has a long history of school vaccination requirements. The first school vaccination requirement was enacted in the 1850s in Massachusetts to prevent the spread of smallpox.&lt;ref name="McAllister-Grum_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McAllister-Grum K | title = Pigments and Vaccines: Evaluating the Constitutionality of Targeting Melanin Groups for Mandatory Vaccination | journal = The Journal of Legal Medicine | volume = 37 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 217–247 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28910223 | doi = 10.1080/01947648.2017.1303288 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school vaccination requirement was put in place after the compulsory school attendance law caused a rapid increase in the number of children in public schools, increasing the risk of smallpox outbreaks. The early movement towards school vaccination laws began at the local level including counties, cities, and boards of education. By 1827, Boston had become the first city to mandate that all children entering public schools show proof of vaccination.&lt;ref name=Hodge2001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hodge JG, Gostin LO | title = School vaccination requirements: historical, social, and legal perspectives | journal = Kentucky Law Journal | volume = 90 | issue = 4 | pages = 831–90 | year = 2001 | pmid = 15868682 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in 1855 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts had established its own statewide vaccination requirements for all students entering school, this influenced other states to implement similar statewide vaccination laws in schools as seen in New York in 1862, Connecticut in 1872, Pennsylvania in 1895, and later the Midwest, South and Western US. By 1963, 20 states had school vaccination laws.&lt;ref name=Hodge2001 /&gt;

These school vaccination resulted in political debates throughout the United States. An example of this political controversy occurred in 1893 in Chicago, where less than 10 percent of the children were vaccinated despite the twelve year old state law.&lt;ref name=Hodge2001 /&gt; Resistance was seen at the local level of the school district as some local school boards and superintendents opposed the state vaccination laws, leading the state board health inspectors to examine vaccination policies in schools. Resistance proceeded during the mid-1900s and in 1977 a nationwide Childhood Immunization Initiative was developed with the goal of increasing vaccination rates among children to 90% by 1979.&lt;ref name=malone&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malone|first=Kevin M|author2=Hinman, Alan R |title=The Public Health Imperative and Individual Rights|journal=Law in Public Health Practice|year=2003|pages=262–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the two-year period of observation, the initiative reviewed the immunization records of more than 28 million children and vaccinated children who had not received the recommended vaccines.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 1922 the constitutionality of childhood vaccination was examined in the Supreme Court case ''Zucht v. King''. The court decided that a school could deny admission to children who failed to provide a certification of vaccination for the protection of the public health.&lt;ref name=malone /&gt; In 1987, a measles epidemic occurred in Maricopa County, Arizona and  another court case, ''Maricopa County Health Department vs. Harmon'', examined the arguments of an individual's right to education over the states need to protect against the spread of disease. The court decided that it is prudent to take action to combat the spread of disease by denying un-vaccinated children a place in school until the risk for the spread of measles had passed.&lt;ref name=malone /&gt;   
 
Schools in the United States require an updated immunization record for all incoming and returning students. While all states require an immunization record, this does not mean that all students must get vaccinated. Opt-out criteria is determined at a state level. In the United States, opt-outs take one of three forms: medical, in which a vaccine is contraindicated due to a component ingredient allergy or existing medical condition; religious; and personal philosophical opposition. As of 2015, 47 states allow religious exemptions, with some states requiring proof of religious membership. Only Mississippi, West Virginia and California do not permit religious exemptions.&lt;ref name=calibill&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/california-governor-signs-strict-school-vaccine-legislation/ar-AAcm68T?ocid=ansnewsap11|title=California governor signs strict school vaccine legislation|author=Horowitz, Julia|publisher=Associated Press|date=30 June 2015|access-date=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 18 states allow personal or philosophical opposition to vaccination.&lt;ref name=ncsl /&gt;

{{Nazism sidebar}}

'''Victims of the Night of the Long Knives''' ({{lang-de|Nacht der langen Messer}}) &amp;ndash; the Nazi [[purge]] in which Hitler and the Nazi regime used the [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS) to deal with the problem of [[Ernst Röhm]] and his [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA) brownshirts (the original Nazi [[paramilitary]] organization), as well as past opponents of the [[Nazi Party|party]] &amp;ndash; numbered at least 85 people murdered.  It took place in [[Germany]] between June 30 and July 2, 1934.

Although most of those killed in what came to be known as "[[The Night of the Long Knives]]" were members of the SA, other victims included close associates of Vice Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], several ''Wehrmacht'' (German Army) generals &amp;ndash; one of whom, [[Kurt von Schleicher]], was formerly the Chancellor of Germany &amp;ndash; and their associates; [[Gregor Strasser]], Hitler's former competitor for control of the Nazi Party; at least one person killed in a case of mistaken identity; and several innocent victims killed because they "knew too much."

The total number of victims is heavily disputed between historians; some estimates put the number in the hundreds.

==Debate over number of victims==

The precise number of victims is disputed and will probably never be known with certainty. During the Purge itself official radio and newspaper reports only gave the names of 10 people killed: the six SA-leaders executed in [[Stadelheim Prison]] on June 30; [[Kurt von Schleicher]], a German general and a former Chancellor of the [[Weimar Republic]], and his wife; [[Karl Ernst]], who was wrongly reported to have been shot in Stadelheim, whereas in fact he was shot in the barracks of Hitler's Personal Guard Unit in Berlin Lichterfelde; and [[Ernst Röhm]].

While the German newspapers avoided disclosing the names of further victims of the purge, in the weeks and months to follow, the international press would set out to detail a more comprehensive account of how many people had been killed between June 30 to July 2. They managed to present about 100 names of people allegedly killed, although a number of those eventually turned out to have survived, such as the former SA chief of Berlin [[Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf]] (who  was actually one of the organizers of the purge - e.g. he warned Werner von Alvensleben, Schleicher's go-between to Hitler—but not Schleicher—to spend the fateful weekend at his hunting lodge; and was himself only killed after participating in the fateful 20th of July 1944 coup attempt.) and Adolf Morsbach, the head of the cosmopolitan-minded Akademischer Austauschdienst (Academic Exchange Programme), who had instead been sent to a [[Nazi concentration camp]].

=== Official list of those killed ===
Immediately after the events of the purge the Gestapo compiled an official list of those killed at the order of Hitler himself who wished to gain an overall view on the number and identity of those killed in order to prepare the Reichstag speech in which he intended to present his interpretation of the occurrences of June 30 to July 2 to the German public and the world in general, and which he finally delivered on July 13. 
This "Gestapo List" comprised a total of 77 names.

In his Reichstag speech Hitler sub-divided those into 61 persons who had been shot during "the action"; allegedly 13 had died resisting arrest while three committed suicide. In his speech Hitler revealed the names of 11 of those 77 ([[Ferdinand von Bredow]], [[Georg von Detten]], [[Karl Ernst]], [[Hans Hayn]], [[Edmund Heines]], [[Peter von Heydebreck]], [[Ernst Röhm]], [[Kurt von Schleicher]], [[Gregor Strasser]], and [[Julius Uhl]]).

However, the list of 77 was far from being complete: Hitler admitted that some excesses had taken place and stated that he had handed over the cases of several people who had been killed as part of unauthorized actions by subordinate organs to the authorities, who were supposed to implement a regular prosecution of the perpetrators. Among those cases who were at first subject to regular investigation and prosecution by the locally responsible Attorney Offices were those of the city clerk Kuno Kamphausen who was murdered at the order of an SS officer who bore a grudge against him for refusing to give a construction permission to his brother and the cases of four Jews and two Communists who were killed without permission from Berlin in the course of arbitrary actions by lower SS echelons in the province of Silesia. In September 1934 [[Heinrich Himmler]]—eager to shield his SS men from legal prosecution—managed to convince Hitler to change his mind on the latter six people, whose names as a consequence, were subsequently added to the official list whose killing was to be considered rightful and which now encompassed 83 names.

The list of 77 or 83 names respectively was kept in several copies—which were stored under lock and key—in the Ministry of Justice and the Gestapo Headquarters. After a law entitled "Gesetz über Maßnahmen der Staatsnotwehr" ("Law pertaining to the Measures of Self-Defense of the State") had been passed by the Reich Cabinet on July 3, which declared: "Die zur Niederschlagung hoch- und landesverräterischer Angriffe am 30. Juni, 1. und 2. Juli 1934 vollzogenen Maßnahmen sind als Staatsnotwehr rechtens" ("The measures taken to clamp down on the treasonous attacks of June 30th, July 1st and 2nd are rightful, due to having been acts of self-defense of the State.")&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Staatsnotwehrgesetz wikisource]&lt;/ref&gt; it was decided that the killing of everybody on that list was to be considered lawful and that therefore the police and Attorney Offices were prohibited from investigating and prosecuting anyone for those killings. The lists thus were used by the Ministry and the Gestapo as a referential tool which could be consulted to decide, whether requests of relatives and friends of those killed to be given information on the circumstances of death of their beloved ones, or requests to prosecute those responsible for their killing would be answered in the affirmative (people killed and not mentioned on the Gestapo list) or in the negative (people whose names were to be found on the list). The same applied to requests of other state authorities (especially police departments and Attorney Offices) who inquired at the Ministry of Justice or the Gestapo headquarters whether they should open and or continue investigation of a specific killing that had taken place on the three days from June 30 to July 2.

The official list of those killed was first published in 1964 by [[Heinrich Bennecke]] (1902-1972) in the appendix of his book ''Die Reichswehr und der "Röhm-Putsch"''.

=== Estimates of people killed in addition to those on the official list===
Later research by historians has shown that in addition to those listed by the Gestapo a number of others also had been killed. Heinrich Bennecke complemented the names of the city clerk Kuno Kamphausen from Waldenburg and the music critic Willi Schmid to his reprint of the official Gestapo list, whereupon he concluded that at least 85 people were killed during the purge. Later, Hans Günther Richardi, in his study on the [[Dachau concentration camp]], added the names of four inmates of Dachau (lawyer Julius Adler (1882–1934), worker Erich Gans (1908-1934), [[:de:Walter Häbich|Walter Häbich]] and worker Adam Hereth (1897-1934)), claiming they were murdered by the SS during the purge. In 1993 Otto Gritschneder published a book on the post–World War II prosecution of those involved in the killings which lists 90 names of people killed (adding the doctor and Röhm associate [[Karl-Günther Heimsoth|Karl Günther Heimsoth]] to the list).&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Otto Gritschneder]]: ''Der Führer hat sie zum Tode verurteilt'', Munich 1993, {{ISBN|3-406-37651-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard J. Evans]] states that at least 85 people were killed and more than 1,000 were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans |first=Richard |title=The Third Reich in Power |publisher=Penguin Group |year=2005 |page=39 |quote=At least eighty-five people are known to have been summarily killed without any formal legal proceedings being taken against them.  Göring alone had over a thousand people arrested.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Kershaw]] also cites the number of deaths at 85. Kershaw notes that "some estimates...put the total number killed at between 150 and 200."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kershaw |first=Ian |title=Hitler: 1889–1936 Hubris |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |year=1999 |page=517}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William L. Shirer]] writes in his ''Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', that "''[[White Book of the Purge|The White Book of the Purge]]'', published by émigrés in Paris claims 401 deaths, but lists only 116 of them. At the 1957 trial in Munich the figure 'more than 1,000' was used."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shirer |first=William J. |title=The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1960  |pages=221–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of those figures are much higher than the ones most historians of the period rely on, and that Shirer himself was not necessarily citing the figures as accurate, but was simply relaying them in his book. The most recent study on the matter lists by name 89 people who were definitely killed, as well as two other cases of whom it is unclear whether they were murdered during the events or slightly earlier or later.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Orth: Der SD-Mann Johannes Schmidt.

The '''Vision Montreal Crisis of 1997''' was one of the most severe internal party crises in [[Montreal]] politics.

==Origins==

In January 1997, [[Mayor of Montreal|Mayor]] [[Pierre Bourque (politician)|Pierre Bourque]] tried to dismiss two members of Montreal's Executive Committee: Deputy Chairman [[Sammy Forcillo]] and [[Pierre Goyer]].  Yet, the city charter of 1921 clearly states that appointments to the Executive Committee are irrevocable.  Forcillo and Goyer left [[Vision Montreal]] (Bourque's party) to sit as [[Independent (politician)|independents]], but exercised their right to stay on the committee.  Therefore, management by consensus became nearly impossible to reach for the remainder of Bourque's term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assnat.qc.ca/archives-35leg2se/fra/Publications/debats/journal/cat/970604.htm#970604012  Commission permanente de l'aménagement du territoire - Auditions et étude détaillée du projet de loi n° 216, Assemblée nationale du Québec, June 4, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

That incident as well as allegations of authoritarian tendencies led thirteen other Vision Montreal councillors to [[crossing the floor|leave the party]] and sit as independents with their colleagues of the opposition.

==Consequences==

By August 1997, only a minority of the council members (24 out of 51) were members of Vision Montreal and the credibility of the Bourque administration was undermined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erudit.org/revue/ps/2003/v22/n1/006579ar.html  La politique municipale à Montréal dans les années 1990 : du « réformisme populaire » au « populisme gestionnaire », Serge Belley, Érudit]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the defectors were supporters of [[Jacques Duchesneau]]'s ''Nouveau Montréal'' party, but others backed [[Jean Doré]]'s ''Équipe Montréal'', the ''[[Montreal Citizens' Movement|RCM]]'' or even came back to ''Vision Montreal'' briefly before the next election.  The severity of the crisis was such that for a while it appeared to seriously affect Bourque's chances of re-election.

Nonetheless, Bourque was re-elected in 1998, as were a substantial majority of his candidates.

'''Znanie''' ({{lang-ru|Зна́ние}}, {{lang|ru-latn|Znaniye/Znanije}}; {{lang-en|Knowledge}}) was a publishing company based in St. Petersburg, Russia founded by [[Konstantin Pyatnitsky]] and other members of the Committee for Literacy. It operated from 1898 to 1913.

==History==
Znanie initially published books for a mass audience on natural science, history, education, and art. [[Maxim Gorky]] joined Znanie in 1900 and became its director in late 1902. Through Znanie, Gorky brought together many of the best known realist writers of the time. Znanie published the collected works of Gorky (9 vols.), [[Alexander Serafimovich]], [[Alexander Kuprin]], [[Vikenty Veresaev]], [[Stepan Skitalets]], [[Nikolai Teleshov]] and many others.&lt;ref name="The Great Soviet Encyclopedia 1970-79"&gt;''The Great Soviet Encyclopedia'', 3rd Edition (1970-1979).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Writer"&gt;A Writer Remembers, Teleshov, Hutchinson, NY, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;

Znanie became known as the most progressive of all Russian publishing houses directed toward broad democratic reader-ships. In 1904 the publishing house began issuing the Znanie Collections, which brought together short stories, novels, poetry and essays written by Russian writers, and by foreign writers such as [[Emile Verhaeren]], publishing 40 volumes by 1913. [[Vladimir Lenin]] wrote that Gorky was aiming through these collections "at a concentration of the best forces of Russian literature." The circulation of the collections reached 65,000 copies. They included the works of Gorky, [[Anton Chekhov]], Kuprin, Serafimovich, [[Leonid Andreev]], [[Ivan Bunin]], Veresaev, [[Dmitry Mamin-Sibiryak]], [[Sergey Gusev-Orenburgsky]], [[Evgeny Chirikov]] and [[Nikolai Garin-Mikhailovsky]], among others.&lt;ref name="The Great Soviet Encyclopedia 1970-79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Writer"/&gt;
[[File:Gorky, Piatnitsky and Skitalets.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Maxim Gorky, Konstantin Pyatnitsky and Stepan Skitalets, 1902.]]

The writers featured in the collections from 1905 to 1907 were united in their protest against tsarism, oppression, national discord, religious prejudice, and [[bourgeois]] morality. Gorky and Serafimovich, on one hand, used socialist realism; Andreyev and certain others, however, were subject to the influences of the decadent movement. After the [[1905 Russian Revolution]] this difference became more marked. In 1911 principal editorship of the Znanie collections was transferred to [[Viktor Mirolyubov]].&lt;ref name="The Great Soviet Encyclopedia 1970-79"/&gt;

In addition to publishing the collected works of young writers and the Znanie Collections, the Znanie Association issued the so-called Penny Library, in which the short works of Znanie writers were published. Gorky also carried out assignments for the [[Bolsheviks]], publishing a series of sociopolitical pamphlets, including the works of [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Paul Lafargue]] and [[August Bebel]]. The Penny Library issued over 300 publications, with editions totaling nearly four million copies.&lt;ref name="The Great Soviet Encyclopedia 1970-79"/&gt;

During the period of reaction after the 1905 Russian Revolution many participants in Znanie left the publishing house. Gorky, forced to live abroad during this period, severed his ties with the publishing house in 1912.&lt;ref name="The Great Soviet Encyclopedia 1970-79"/&gt;
