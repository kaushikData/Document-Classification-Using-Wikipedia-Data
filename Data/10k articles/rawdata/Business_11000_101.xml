'''Alfred "Alfie" Hale''' (born 28 August 1939 in [[Waterford]], Republic of Ireland) is a former Irish [[association football|footballer]] and manager who played for several clubs in both the [[League of Ireland]] and the [[Football League|English League]], most notably, [[Waterford United F.C.|Waterford United]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] and [[Cork Celtic F.C.|Cork Celtic]]. During his career Hale scored 153 goals in the League of Ireland and a further 66 with English League clubs. As an international, Hale also played for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]].

After retiring as a player Hale managed several teams in the League of Ireland, most notably, [[Cork Celtic F.C.|Cork Celtic]], [[Waterford United F.C.|Waterford United]] and [[Kilkenny City F.C.|Kilkenny City]]. In June 2003, Hale and such other notable [[Waterford]] footballers as [[Davy Walsh]], [[Paddy Coad]], [[Peter Thomas (footballer born 1944)|Peter Thomas]], [[Jim Beglin]] and [[John O'Shea]] were honoured by the Waterford City Council and presented with a [[Waterford Crystal]] vase.

==Playing career==

===Waterford===
Hale spent much of his playing and coaching career at [[Waterford United F.C.|Waterford United]]. His father, three brothers and two uncles had all played for the club in the 1930s. In 1930 the trio even formed an all-Hale half-back line in a league game at home to [[Bohemians F.C.|Bohemians]]. At the age of 17 Hale junior along with [[Peter Fitzgerald (footballer)]] made a scoring [[League of Ireland]] debut at Kilcohan Park on [[St Patrick's Day]] 1957 in a 3–1 win over Bohemians&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1957/0318/Pg004.html#Ar00412:2C67E82EA7FD31969435F6AA2D57B131B7C62F27E83027FD3037E83397FD2FD85834186D]&lt;/ref&gt;

He left Waterford in 1960 but after seven seasons in the [[Football League|English League]], he returned in 1966. Then together with [[Johnny Matthews]], he became a central figure in a Waterford team that dominated the [[League of Ireland]]. In 1971–72 Hale was player-manager of the side when they beat [[Cork Hibernians F.C.|Cork Hibernians]] in dramatic circumstances at [[Flower Lodge]] to claim his fifth league title in six seasons. In both 1971–72 and 1972–73 he also finished as joint top goalscorer in the league, scoring 22 and 20 goals respectively.&lt;ref name=rsssf/&gt; He is also the 7th highest [[League of Ireland]] goalscorer of all time with 153 league goals.&lt;ref name=rsssf&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/iertops.html  Top goalscorers in League of Ireland – RSSSF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406093820/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/iertops.html |date=6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a benefit game in August 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1971/0805/Pg004.html  www.irishtimes.com (subscription required)]&lt;/ref&gt;

He scored twice against [[AC Omonia]] in the [[1972–73 European Cup]].

===Aston Villa===
In June 1960, aged 19, Hale was sold by [[Waterford United F.C.|Waterford United]] to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for a fee of £4,500. However, Hale failed to establish himself in the Villa first team and went on to make just 7 first team appearances, scoring 2 goals. Despite this Hale won his first international cap for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] while at Villa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/OnThisDay/0,,10265~855241,00.html  Aston Villa site] {{Dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doncaster Rovers===
Hale signed for [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] in the summer of 1962 and made his debut for the club on 18 August in a 2–0 defeat to [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] in the [[Football League Fourth Division]]. He scored four goals in a single game as he helped Rovers to a record league win when they beat [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]]. In three seasons with Rovers, Hale made 119 league appearances and scored 42 goals. He also made 7 appearances for Rovers in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and 9 in the [[FA Cup]], scoring 2 further goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doncasterrovers.co.uk/players/GtoJ/Hale,Alfie.htm|title=Alfie Hale: inside forward 1962–1965|publisher=Doncasterrovers.co.uk|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of Ireland international===
Between 1962 and 1973, Hale made 14 appearances and scored 2 goals for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team]]. He made his senior international debut on 8 April 1962 in a 3–2 home defeat against [[Austria national football team|Austria]]. Hale went on to score twice for the Republic of Ireland, both goals coming in 1968, against [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and then Austria. He made his last appearance for the Republic of Ireland on 21 October 1973 as a substitute in a 1–0 home win against Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerscene.ie/sssenior/player.php?id=328|title=Alfie Hale|work=International Mens Statistics|publisher=Soccerscene.ie|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching career==
As a manager Hale would return to [[Waterford United F.C.|Waterford United]] for two further spells. During the first of these, between 1982 until 1986, he guided the club to victory in the [[League of Ireland Cup]] in 1985 and to the [[FAI Cup]] final in 1986. He returned to manage the club again between 1991 and 1993 and helped them achieve promotion from the [[League of Ireland First Division|First Division]] in 1992. In 2005, he briefly returned to Waterford United once again, this time acting as special advisor.

Aside from Waterford, Hale has also coached several other teams in the League of Ireland. He was appointed player/manager of [[Thurles Town F.C.|Thurles Town]] in May 1981&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1981/0521/Pg003.html#Ar00313:07870E0A972F08776D0A578011F80113A81406276D081780 Irish Times (subscription required)]&lt;/ref&gt; where he made history by becoming the League of Ireland's oldest ever goalscorer, and also the only player to score in four different League of Ireland decades. As manager of [[Cobh Ramblers F.C.|Cobh Ramblers]], Hale gave [[Roy Keane]] his debut in 1990. Between 1995 and 1999 he was manager of [[Kilkenny City A.F.C.|Kilkenny City]] and in 1997, with a team which included the likes of his son Richie, Brendan Rea, Paul Cashin and Pascal Keane, he guided them to the First Division title. After leaving Kilkenny, Hale remained active in junior football working with Waterford Crystal F.C. and Tramore F.C, winning the first league in 50 years with Tramore in 2000–01.

==Businessman==
At the same time as managing various [[League of Ireland]] clubs, Hale also established himself as a prominent businessman in the [[Waterford]] area. In 1978, he opened a sports shop, currently trading under the name ''Alfie Hale's [[Intersport]]'' and located at Arundal Square.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alfiehale.com/about.htm Alfie Hale's Intersport] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707110225/http://www.alfiehale.com/about.htm |date= 7 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also owns a chain of pubs including ''Alfie Hale's Bar'' in Ballybricken&lt;ref&gt;[http://ratemypub.ie/pub.php?pubid=4931 Alfie Hale's Bar]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Alfie Hale's Sports Bar'' on Lombard Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ratemypub.ie/editpub.php?pubid=4352 Alfie Hale's Sports Bar]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, he settled with the [[Revenue Commissioners]] for over €100,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.ie/national-news/former-ireland-player-to-pay-revenue-over-8364100000-1561089.html&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the [[2012 League of Ireland]] season Hale is tenth in the all-time League of Ireland goalscoring list with 153 league goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/iertops.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406093820/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/iertops.html |archivedate=6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Atul Shah''' is a [[businessman]] and [[entrepreneur]] in [[Kenya]]. He is the [[Managing Director]] and [[Chief Executive Officer]] of the Nakumatt Holdings Limited, the parent company of [[Nakumatt|Nakumatt Supermarkets]], the largest, privately owned supermarket chain in the [[African Great Lakes]] area, with branches in [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Rwanda]]. {{asof|September 2014}}, the retail chain maintained 50 stores in four countries, employed over 7,000 people and had annual sales in excess of US$650 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/no-secret-to-doing-business-in-africa-says-nakumatt-md-atul-shah/43244/|

==Background and education==
He was born in [[Nandi Hills, Kenya|Nandi Hills]], Kenya in 1961. In 1965, when Atul was four years old, the family relocated to [[Nakuru]]. Atul's father, '''Mangalal Shah''', who had migrated to Kenya from India in 1947, opened a retail clothing store opposite the Nakuru open air market. Atul' s older brother, Vimal started working in the business in 1970. In 1975 Mangalal began exporting clothing to Uganda, often on credit. Towards the end of 1976, with debtors behind on their payments and creditors demanding for their money, Atul's father declared bankruptcy, with total debts of KSh1.2 million. The store was closed and Mangalal went to work for his brother '''Hasmukh Shah''', who then owned a shop called '''Nakuru Mattresses'''.

Following the closure of their father's business, Atul Shah and his brother, Vimal Shah opened a clothing store that they named '''Furmatts''', which among other things, sold bed sheets which the brothers stitched at home. In 1978, due to booming business, supported by the 1970s coffee boom in East Africa, the two sons and their father managed to pay off the KSh1.2 million debt. They bought Nakuru Mattress from their uncle, who relocated to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2 December 2014| url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000036154/the-non-quitter-who-founded-nakumatt-supermarkets?articleID=2000036154&amp;story_title=the-non-quitter-who-founded-nakumatt-supermarkets&amp;pageNo=1|date=31 May 2011|first=Kenneth|
last=Kwama|title=The Non-Quitter Who Founded Nakumatt Supermarkets| 
newspaper=[[The Standard (Kenya)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nakumatt supermarkets==
Under new ownership, Nakuru Mattress and Furmatts began integrating their operations. From two stores Nakuru town in 1978, they diversified the list of items on offer. In addition to clothes and mattresses, they began selling saucepans, cooking pots, plastic basins and umbrellas, among other products. In 1984, they opened a store in [[Eldoret]], their first outside of Nakuru. In 1986 the retail chain expanded to [[Nairobi]], with a store on Ukwala Road.

'''Carlos Tavares''' (born on August 14 1958) is a Portuguese businessman who serves as the [[chief executive officer]] and Chairman of the Managing Board of [[Groupe PSA]], France's largest car manufacturer. He was formerly the [[chief operating officer]] at [[Renault]]&lt;ref name="ftmichael"&gt;Michael Stothard, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5d6230c0-c1ed-11e4-abb3-00144feab7de.html#axzz3XHRelzpJ Classic rally car driving with the FT: Carlos Tavares], ''Financial Times'', March 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Carlos Tavares was born in 1958 in [[Portugal]].&lt;ref name="wsjmike"&gt;Mike Ramsey, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324677204578187420765528696 Renault's Carlos Tavares: Meet the Next Auto Boss], ''The Wall Street Journal'', December 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref name="wsjmike"/&gt; He graduated from the [[École Centrale Paris]].&lt;ref name="psapeugeot"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.psa-peugeot-citroen.com/en/automotive-group/governance/executive-committee/carlos-tavares# |title=PSA Peugeot: Executive Committee |access-date=2015-04-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417032024/http://www.psa-peugeot-citroen.com/en/automotive-group/governance/executive-committee/carlos-tavares# |archive-date=2015-04-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Renault===
Tavares started his career at [[Renault]] in 1981.&lt;ref name="wsjmike"/&gt; He was director of the [[Renault Mégane]] II project.&lt;ref name="wsjmike"/&gt; 

He then worked for the [[Nissan]] subsidiary of Renault.&lt;ref name="wsjmike"/&gt; By 2009, he oversaw Nissan's presence in North and South America.&lt;ref name="wsjmike"/&gt; 

By 2011, he was [[chief operating officer]] for Renault, the number two executive under [[Carlos Ghosn]], the [[chairman]] and [[chief executive officer]] of Renault and Nissan.&lt;ref name="ftpeugeottaps"&gt;Michael Stothard, Henry Foy, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/19894866-55c9-11e3-b6e7-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3XHRelzpJ Peugeot taps former Renault executive Carlos Tavares as chief], ''Financial Times'', November 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Tavares had much in common with Ghosn, as both were "raised in Portuguese-speaking environments. Both went on to graduate from French Grandes Ecoles and - perhaps less surprisingly - both like fast cars". However, Tavares resigned from Renault on August 29, 2013, two weeks after publicly saying that he wanted to become CEO at an automaker, and Tavares reportedly refusing Ghosn's demand that he apologize to staff for the gaffe. It was said that Tavares was ambitious and sought more responsibilities at Renault, however Ghosn was only four years older and had no plans to step aside soon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-peugeot-ceo-carlos-carlos/carlos-vs-carlos-peugeot-move-turns-double-act-to-rivalry-idUSBREA221WL20140303]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Groupe PSA===
Tavares has served as the chief executive officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Groupe PSA since 2014, replacing [[Philippe Varin]].&lt;ref name="ftpeugeottaps"/&gt; During his tenure, he has spearheaded cost-cutting measures and increased the company's market share in China, which returned Groupe PSA back to profitability after several years of losses.&lt;ref name="ftmichael"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autonews.com/article/20161024/OEM02/310249969/carlos-tavares-next-frontier]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Tavares has three children.&lt;ref&gt;Anne-Sophie Lechevallier, 'Carlos Tavares - L'homme providentiel de PSA', in ''[[Paris Match]]'', 28 November 2013, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; He has been an amateur race car driver since the age of twenty-two.&lt;ref name="wsjmike"/&gt; He has competed in the [[Rallye Monte-Carlo Historique]].&lt;ref name="ftmichael"/&gt; He also collects "classic cars" and owns a "1979 Peugeot 504 V6 Coupé, a 1976 Alpine A110 and a Porsche 912 from 1966".&lt;ref name="ftmichael"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4496">'''Common Impact''' is an American [[nonprofit organization]] headquartered in Boston, [[Massachusetts]]. It catalyzes a new, connected economy by aligning business and social purpose, connecting [[business]] professionals to local nonprofits that need assistance in [[information technology]], [[marketing]], [[human resources]], operations and finance. Common Impact's model for [[social change]] involves [[social innovation]], [[employee engagement]], and [[corporate social responsibility]].

==History==

Theresa M. Ellis co-founded Common Impact in 2000 with Zach Goldstein, both graduates of [[Dartmouth College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alumni.dartmouth.edu/default.aspx?id=495|title=Young Alumni of Dartmouth|accessdate=2008-07-25|publisher=Dartmouth College|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071220234714/http://alumni.dartmouth.edu/default.aspx?id=495|archivedate=2007-12-20|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Ellis helped connect her friend, an IT professional, to a [[Washington, D.C.]] nonprofit needing assistance with a [[database]] while she was working for another nonprofit. She founded Common Impact to help more [[corporate]] professionals [[Volunteering|volunteer]] their professional [[skills]] and help solve [[social problems]] in the areas of [[health]], [[House|housing]] and [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://alumni.dartmouth.edu/default.aspx?id=879 |title=Celebrating 35 Years of Women at Dartmouth| accessdate=2008-07-25 |publisher=Dartmouth College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
Many of the projects between corporate employees and nonprofit organizations involve improving databases, creating new marketing materials and restructuring human resources tools. Before each project, Common Impact screens the nonprofit and matches it to a trained team of business professionals who are skilled in the project area. A few examples of projects include redesigning a website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/04/12/more_than_a_helping_hand_for_charities/?page=1.com= |title=More than a helping hand for charities |accessdate=2008-07-15 |publisher=The Boston Globe| first=Sacha | last=Pfeiffer | date=2008-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and evaluating marketing materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ca.com/us/about/content.aspx?cid=145489 |title=CA Together in the Spotlight |accessdate=2008-07-22 |publisher=CA Together in the Spotlight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

Common Impact "helps nonprofits evaluate their internal operations. Then it finds corporate volunteers who can work with them to improve their technology, marketing, and human resource functions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/04/12/more_than_a_helping_hand_for_charities/?page=1.com= |title=More than a helping hand for charities |accessdate=2008-07-15 |publisher=The Boston Globe| first=Sacha | last=Pfeiffer | date=2008-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These projects have generated over $6 million in resources for the [[nonprofit sector]].  Businesses are increasingly recognizing the importance of [[volunteering]] professional skills as more employees want to help their communities &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120940853880850351 |title=The Latest Office Perk: Getting Paid to Volunteer |accessdate=2008-07-25 |publisher=The Wall Street Journal| first=Sarah E. | last=Needleman | date=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 400 corporate employees from companies such as Cisco, Genworth Financial, Fidelity Investments and State Street Corporation have volunteered their skills by working with Common Impact. Some examples of projects Fidelity Investments volunteers worked on are fundraising, case management, databases, and website design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bcccc.net/index.cfm/fuseaction/Page.viewPage/pageId/1620 |title=In Good Company: Fidelity |publisher=Boston College Center for Corporate Citizenship}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has connected business professionals to over 150 [[nonprofit organizations]] in [[Greater Boston]], [[New York City]], and [[Richmond, Virginia]]. The [[employee engagement]] relationships Common Impact fosters have translated into an estimated 9,000 hours of skilled volunteer time donated to nonprofit organizations.

'''Riverside''', is a neighborhood that entirely comprises '''Downtown Spokane''' ([[Spokane|the city]]'s central business district), as well as the area immediately to the north of [[Riverfront Park (Spokane)|Riverfront Park]].  Riverside's rough boundaries are [[Interstate 90 (Washington)|I-90]] to the south, Division Street to the east, Maple Street to the west, and across the [[Spokane River]] north to Boone Avenue. Bridges (some of them pedestrian-only) span the river at nearly every block.

==Buildings==

[[File:Holley-Mason Building NRHP 83004262 Spokane County, WA.jpg|thumb|right|Holley-Mason Building]]
The Bank of America Financial Center, standing at {{convert|288|ft|m|0}} tall, is the tallest building in Spokane.  It was completed in 1981.  The nearby Wells Fargo Center is the second tallest building (243&amp;nbsp;ft), and was completed in one year later 1982.  Until 2006, with the construction of the Davenport Tower &amp; Residences (an expansion of [[The Davenport Hotel (Spokane)|The Davenport Hotel]]), no other high-rise has gone up in Spokane.

Other significant buildings in downtown include the [[Spokane Convention Center]], the [[First Interstate Center for the Arts]], and the [[Spokane Arena]].

==Geography==
The topography of Riverside is mostly flat except for areas downstream of the Spokane Falls which are located in a canyon. South of Riverside slopes up to the South Hill, quite steeply in some places such as Pioneer Park, where long cliffs oriented east-west provide great views of Riverside, the North Side and [[Spokane Valley, Washington|Spokane Valley]] to the east.

Riverside straddles Sprague Avenue, which divides the city into North and South. On the eastern end of Riverside, Division Street splits the city into East and West. I-90 is elevated through almost all of downtown, often with parking lots underneath, but occasional blocks are solid cement, forming a barrier at the southern end of Riverside. Immediately south of the Interstate the high density area continues into a growing medical district with Spokane's two largest hospitals, [[Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center and Children's Hospital|Sacred Heart]] and [[Deaconess Hospital (Spokane, Washington)|Deaconess]].

To the west is one of Spokane's oldest and densest neighborhoods, Browne's Addition. In the photo, Browne's addition is the treed area in the foreground on the right. The left side of the foreground is the valley cut by the Spokane river immediately downstream of the falls; this is the small and similar neighborhood of Peaceful Valley.

[[Gonzaga University]] is located just upstream on the north side of the river from Riverside. Across the river from Gonzaga are the new University District home campuses of [[Eastern Washington University]] and [[Washington State University]]. Division Street separates Downtown from the University District.

==Rebirth and development==

[[Image:2008-1018-023-DavenportHotel-int1.jpg|thumb|right| Lobby of the Davenport Hotel]]

Riverside had undergone a major rebirth in the years before the recession, after the completion of the [[River Park Square Mall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Welcome to Downtown Spokane| publisher = Downtown Spokane Partnership| url = http://www.downtownspokane.org/| accessdate = 2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The historic [[The Davenport Hotel (Spokane)|Davenport Hotel]] underwent a major renovation in 2002 after being vacant for over 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Hotel History| publisher = The Davenport Hotel and Tower| url = http://www.thedavenporthotel.com/index.php?act=/history| accessdate = 2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project was funded by local entrepreneur [[Walt Worthy]], who also added a Safari-themed 20 story tower to the hotel in 2007.  Other major projects include the Holley Mason Building - seen as the catalyst to Riverside's rebirth, the building of the Big Easy concert house (now renamed the [[Knitting Factory]]), the remodeling of the historic [[Montvale Hotel]] and [[Fox Theatre (Spokane)|Fox Theater]] (now home to the [[Spokane Symphony]]), numerous new condo buildings, and renovations of historic, older brick buildings that will soon house both condos and business.  Also, the [[Spokane Convention Center]] just finished a major expansion which helped host the [[2007 United States Figure Skating Championships|2007 US Figure Skating Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = About The Spokane Convention Center| publisher = Spokane Convention Center| url = http://www.spokanecenter.com/about.php| accessdate = 2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Districts and areas==

===Riverfront Park===
[[Image:Spokane Riverfront Park 20061014.jpg|thumb|right|The Great Northern clock tower and U.S. Pavilion in Riverfront Park]]

[[Riverfront Park (Spokane)|Riverfront Park]], created after Expo '74 and occupying the same site, is {{convert|100|acre|km2}} in Riverside and the site of some of Spokane's largest events.&lt;ref name =Riverfront&gt;{{cite web| title = About the Park| publisher = Riverfront Park| url = http://www.spokaneriverfrontpark.com/content.php?id=129| accessdate = 2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park has views of the [[Spokane Falls]], and holds a number of civic attractions, including a Skyride that is a rebuilt gondola that carries visitors across the falls from high above the river gorge, a 5-story IMAX theater, and a small amusement park (which is converted into an ice-skating rink during the winter months) with numerous rides and concessions.&lt;ref name =Riverfront/&gt; The park is host to a full schedule of family entertainment and events such as the [[Lilac Bloomsday Run|Bloomsday]] Post-Race Celebration, [[Spokane Hoopfest|Hoopfest]], the [[IMAX]] Film Festival, Spokane Music Festival, Pig-Out in the Park, Restaurant Fair, Pow Wow, [[First Night]] Spokane, plus many outdoor concerts and other community activities. The Park also includes a hand-carved carousel created in 1909 by [[Charles I. D. Looff]] as a wedding present for his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natatorium Carousel/ Looff Carousel |publisher=City-County of Spokane Historic Preservation Office |url=http://www.historicspokane.org/NationalRegister/nat_carousel.htm |accessdate=2009-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610155117/http://www.historicspokane.org/NationalRegister/nat_carousel.htm |archivedate=June 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The carousel still operates in Riverfront Park, where riders can participate in an old-time ring toss. The carousel continues to offer a free ride to the rider who grabs the brass ring. Riverfront Park also includes ample views of the Spokane falls as well as other water features (some man-made) of the Spokane River.

===Downtown Core===
[[File:SpokaneSkywalks.jpg|thumb]]
The Downtown Core is the heart of Riverside and is generally considered to be the several block vicinity surrounding Spokane City Hall, River Park Square, the STA Plaza, and the Davenport Hotel. A majority of Spokane's high-rise buildings are located in this core area.  Spokane's skywalk system also overlays the street grid and street life within the core, linking 14 blocks together.  A number of downtown's retailers and restaurants are also located within the Downtown Core.

===Arts and Entertainment District===
Riverside's rich Entertainment District is home to some of the best restaurants, live entertainment venues, and hotels in Spokane. Located south and west of the Downtown Core, this area hosts many concerts, plays, galleries, and other shows. These events are hosted in a variety of venues including the Fox Theater, The Bing Crosby Theater, and The Knitting Factory. 

The Arts and Entertainment District has a number of large historic buildings. Many of these buildings are hotels that have been beautifully renovated, and capture the charm of turn of the century Spokane. More recently, this area has become a hub for breweries. There are multiple tasting rooms between Lincoln and Cedar Street along First and Second Avenue, making it a popular destination for brewery tours.

===Convention Center District===
[[File:SpokaneConvCtr_CentennialTrail.jpg|thumb|left|The Centennial Trail runs through the Convention Center District between the Spokane River (pictured right) and the convention center (pictured left).]]
The Convention Center District is situated to the east of the Downtown Core and is anchored by the [[Spokane Convention Center]] and [[First Interstate Center for the Arts]]. Its location is directly adjacent to Riverfront Park; an advantage that has been embraced through careful planning and architectural design of buildings in the district which allows the buildings to interface with the park, the river, and recreational trails (including the [[Spokane River Centennial Trail|Centennial Trail]]) that run along it. The district was born out of [[Expo '74]], which developed the original structure that ultimately became the IFirst Interstate Center for the Arts and the Spokane Convention Center.   The convention center has been expanded several times since its original construction, stretching the bounds of the district farther east, where it ties into the University District.

Much of the other development around the Convention Center District stems from the Spokane Convention Center and the First Interstate Center for the Arts, including restaurants, retail, and hotels.  Spokane's largest and tallest hotels, including the DoubleTree, Davenport Grand, and Red Lion Hotel at the Park are located in or immediately adjacent to the convention center district.  The business types located around the Convention Center District provide a common overlap with businesses supporting the adjacent University District as well, helping to alleviate some of the "urban dead zones" that are all too commonly created when the convention centers - particularly large ones in major cities much larger than Spokane - are not in use.

===Kendall Yards===
Located along the southern edge of the West Central neighborhood just across the Spokane River from Downtown Spokane is Kendall Yards, a [[new urbanism|new urbanist]] community. Though not officially within the boundaries of Riverside, Kendall Yards plays a vital role in the culture and future of the downtown core by increasing the urban residential population in the immediate vicinity of it.

[[Image:Downtown Spokane WA on approach to the airport.jpg|left|thumb|Kendall Yards is an urban infill development; its site is pictured in the lower-left hand corner.]]
The neighborhood is one of the largest [[infill|urban infill]] development projects in the city's history and has reclaimed a [[brownfield land|brownfield]] formerly occupied by [[rail yard]]s.  The site of Kendall Yards used to be the main entry point of the railroad into Riverside before alterations to the downtown area in preparations for [[Expo '74]] relocated the railroads south of the Spokane River.  The {{convert|78|acre|km2|sing=on}} site sat vacant from that point on for another three decades until 2005, when a brownfield cleanup&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.djc.com/news/en/11180868.html Spokane does brownfields on a grand scale]&lt;/ref&gt; took place in preparations for the groundbreaking of the development.  The cleanup, which won a [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]] award, took approximately one year and removed over 223,000 tons of contaminated soil from the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2006/mar/29/railroad-cleanup-gets-epa-award/ Railroad cleanup gets EPA award]&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial proposal for Kendall Yards called for 2,600 residences and 1 million square feet of commercial space, worth up to $1 billion.  The development broke ground in 2007, however, the impending [[Great Recession]] bankrupted the project's developer before any buildings were constructed.  The now cleaned-up site continued to sit vacant for another few years until a Spokane-based developer, Greenstone Corp., purchased the site in 2009 and began construction in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2010/apr/22/work-begins-kendall-yards-housing/ Work begins on Kendall Yards housing]&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to the economic conditions at the time, the original plans for the development were scaled back; the proposed density, residential unit count, and commercial square footage were all reduced to approximately one-half of the original scope.  However, the scaled-back plans did have its advantages; the development was more likely to be successful, the more land would be available for open green space, and the reduced density would be more compatible with the existing fabric of the adjacent West Central neighborhood to the north.  Construction of the development is phased and is expected to be ongoing through the mid-2020s.

[[File:Kendall-Yards Summit-Parkway1.jpg|right|thumb|A view down Summit Parkway in the business district of Kendall Yards. It is worthwhile to note the wide sidewalks, landscaped streets, and mix of building types, all consistent with new urbanist principles.]]
Designed on [[new urbanism|new urbanist]] principles, the plan and makeup of the neighborhood emphasizes mixed-use development, diversity of densities and housing types, open space, and walkability.  Much of the neighborhood consists of multi-family structures of townhomes, condominiums, and apartments.  There are also single-family detached homes, community gardens, free-standing commercial buildings, and mixed-use buildings (with ground-floor retail and apartment units above).  Green and recreational space is also emphasized; the community includes parks, sidewalks, and plazas and also completed a long-awaited infill section of the [[Spokane River Centennial Trail|Centennial Trail]], extending it from Downtown through the entire {{convert|78|acre|km2|sing=on}} site along the northern banks of the Spokane River Gorge.

===North Bank===
The North Bank area is located to the north of the Spokane River and Riverfront Park. It is home to a variety of uses including civic, residential, shopping, dining, and lodging. Destinations include the [[Spokane Arena]], the central YMCA/YWCA, Spokane Civic Theater, and Flour Mill.  A number of businesses based on the North Bank are in the health, banking, hotel, and real estate industries.

The '''Du Pont family''' ({{IPAc-en|dj|uː|ˈ|p|ɒ|n|t}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dupont "DuPont"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] family descended from [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours]] (1739–1817). Since the 19th century, the Du Pont family has been one of the richest families in America.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/du-pont/|title=Du Pont  family|work=forbes.com|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many former Du Pont family estates have been opened to the public as museums, gardens, or parks, such as [[Nemours Mansion and Gardens]], [[Longwood Gardens]], and [[Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library]]. The family's first American estate, located at [[Hagley Museum and Library]], has been designated a [[National Historic Landmark]]. In recent years, the family has continued to be known for its association with political and business ventures, as well as philanthropic efforts on behalf of various organizations such as [[The Jockey Club]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lunger Estate Makes Major Contribution to Equine Research|url=http://www.jockeyclub.com/default.asp?section=Resources&amp;area=0&amp;archives=show&amp;story=194|website=The Jockey Club|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duvoisin|first1=Marc|title=Family's Reach Influenced Business, Politics And Arts The Du Pont Family Can Take Some Credit For The Creation Of Longwood Gardens, The Atomic Bomb And Nylon Hosiery.|url=http://articles.philly.com/1996-01-28/news/25653867_1_du-pont-eleuthere-irenee-pont-iv|accessdate=18 April 2015|publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=28 January 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Delaware Art Museum]], and the [[Grand Opera House (Wilmington, Delaware)|Grand Opera House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nagengast|first1=Larry|title=The Past, Present and Future of DuPont|url=http://www.delawaretoday.com/Delaware-Today/April-2014/The-Past-Present-and-Future-of-DuPont/index.php?cparticle=7&amp;siarticle=6#artanc|publisher=Delaware Today|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two family members were the subjects of well-publicized criminal cases. Heir [[John Eleuthère du Pont]] was convicted of murdering wrestling coach [[Dave Schultz (wrestling)|Dave Schultz]] in 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/10/sports/olympics/10dupont.html|title=John E. du Pont, Heir Who Killed an Olympian, Dies at 72|date=10 December 2010|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and heir [[Robert H.

The family fortune as of 2016 was $14.3 billion with over 3,500 living members around the world, most of whom are only marginally related.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;

==History==
[[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours]] was the son of a Parisian watchmaker and a member of a [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] [[Huguenot]] family, and descendant of a minor [[nobility|noble family]] on his mother's side. He and his sons, [[Victor Marie du Pont]] and [[Éleuthère Irénée du Pont]], emigrated from France in 1800 to the United States and used the resources of their Huguenot heritage to found one of the most prominent of [[United States|American]] families, and one of its most successful [[corporation]]s, [[DuPont|E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]], initially established by Éleuthère Irénée as a gunpowder manufacturer.

In 1802, Éleuthère Irénée du Pont established a gunpowder mill on the banks of the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine River]] near [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. The location provided all the necessities to operate the mill: a water flow sufficient to power it, available timber (mainly willow trees) that could be turned into charcoal fine enough to use for gunpowder, close proximity to the [[Delaware River]] to allow for shipments of sulfur and saltpeter, the other ingredients used in the manufacture of gunpowder.

Over time the [[DuPont|Du Pont company]] grew into the largest black powder manufacturing firm in the world. The family remained in control of the company up through the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DuPont Co.'s 19 leaders since 1802|url=http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/local/2015/10/05/duponts-leaders/73422578/|accessdate=27 October 2015|work=Wilmington News Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and family trusts still own a substantial amount of the company's stock.

The family played a large part in politics during the 18th and 19th centuries and assisted in negotiations for the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] and the [[Louisiana purchase]]. Both [[T. Coleman du Pont|T. Coleman]] and [[Henry A. du Pont]] served as U.S. senators, and [[Pierre S. du Pont, IV]] served as Governor of Delaware.

The family has also played an important role in historic preservation and land conservation, including helping to found the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], preserving President [[James Madison]]'s home [[Montpelier (Orange, Virginia)|Montpelier]], and establishing numerous museums such as Winterthur and the [[Delaware Museum of Natural History]]. The Brandywine Conservancy founded by family member [[George Alexis Weymouth]] owns around {{convert|2350|acres|0|abbr=on}} of land in Pennsylvania and Delaware, and owns permanent conservation easements on an additional {{convert|37000|acres|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bauers|first1=Sandy|title=Conservancy gains easement Winterthur's pastoral beauty is now protected|url=http://articles.philly.com/2002-07-25/news/25358114_1_winterthur-henry-f-du-pont-easement|accessdate=27 October 2015|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=25 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Montgomery|first1=Jeff|title=The Brandywine Conservancy: Preserving Nature, Art, and History|url=http://php.delawareonline.com/news/assets/2014/09/WIL_1001_BRANDYWINE_CONSERVANCY_.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2015|work=Wilmington News Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Lammot du Pont Copeland]]'s [[Mt.

Beginning with [[William du Pont, Jr.]] and his sister, [[Marion duPont Scott]], many members of the Du Pont family have been involved in the breeding and racing of [[thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racehorses]], as well as establishing racehorse venues and training tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emc.vetmed.vt.edu/emcmariondupontscott.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011227114730/http://emc.vetmed.vt.edu/emcmariondupontscott.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 December 2001|title=Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center|publisher=University of Vermont|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spelling of the name==
The stylings “Dupont”, “DuPont”, du Pont" and "Du Pont" for the family name have both been widely used in published writings. In many publications, the styling is "du Pont" when quoting an individual's full name and "Du Pont" when speaking of the family as a whole, although some individual Du Ponts have chosen to style it differently, such as [[Samuel Francis Du Pont]]. The name of the chemical company founded by the family is today styled solid as "[[DuPont]]" in the short form (but the long form is styled as E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company); the stylings "Du Pont" and "DuPont" for the company's short name coexisted in the 20th century, but the latter is now consistently used in the company's branding. The solid styling "duPont" is less common, but the [[Nemours Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children]] uses it, as does the [[duPont Registry]]. William S. Dutton's mid-20th-century history of the family business&lt;ref name="Dutton_1942"&gt;{{Citation |last=Dutton |first=William S. |year=1942 |title=Du Pont: One Hundred and Forty Years |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WEtZAAAAYAAJ |lccn=42011897 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses "Du Pont" both for the family mentioned generally and for the company's short name but "du Pont" in an individual's full name (for example, "[[Éleuthère Irénée du Pont]]", "[[Henry du Pont]]", "[[Alfred V. du Pont |Alfred Victor du Pont]]", "[[Lammot du Pont I|Lammot du Pont]]"); for example, "when he [Lammot du Pont] went to General Henry du Pont with the proposal that the Du Ponts manufacture dynamite, he was answered by a blunt and unqualified 'No!'"&lt;ref name="Dutton_1942"/&gt;{{rp|116}}) The first page of Dutton's monograph&lt;ref name="Dutton_1942"/&gt;{{rp|3}} contains the following footnote about the surname's styling (the mention of "Samuel Dupont" here refers to the 18th-century Parisian watchmaker, not to [[Samuel Francis Du Pont|his 19th-century descendant]]): "Samuel Dupont used this form of the family name [i.e., Dupont], but beginning in 1763 [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours|his son]] signed himself 'Du Pont.' Later, he added 'de Nemours' to his name to prevent confusion with two other Duponts in the [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|French Chamber of Deputies]]. Du Pont, in English, is pronounced with the accent on the second syllable. In French, neither syllable is accented."&lt;ref name="Dutton_1942"/&gt;{{rp|3}} 

[[French orthography|French orthographic]] tradition for the styling of ''de'' (or its inflected forms) as a surname particle, in either nobiliary or non-nobiliary form, is discussed at ''[[Nobiliary particle#France|Nobiliary particle 
§ France]]''. In non-nobiliary form, the prevalent French styling of the name is "[[Wiktionary:Dupont|Dupont]]", and thus the choice by Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours to begin styling himself so during the monarchical era hints at social ambition. But the influence of French orthography and prerevolutionary class structure on how [[English orthography]] styles surnames today is outweighed by how families and individuals so named style themselves.

'''Edward Douglass White Jr.''' (November 3, 1845 – May 19, 1921), American [[politician]] and [[jurist]], was a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] and the ninth Chief Justice of the United States. He served on the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] from 1894 to 1921. He is best known for formulating the ''[[Rule of reason|Rule of Reason]]'' standard of [[Competition law|antitrust law]].

Born in [[Lafourche Parish, Louisiana]], White practiced law in [[New Orleans]] after graduating from the [[Tulane University|University of Louisiana]]. His father, [[Edward Douglass White Sr.]], was the 10th [[Governor of Louisiana]] and a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] [[United States Congress|Congressman]]. White fought for the [[Confederated States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and was captured in 1865. After the war, White won election to the [[Louisiana State Senate]] and served on the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]]. As a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], White represented Louisiana in the United States Senate from 1891 to 1894.

In 1894, President [[Grover Cleveland]] appointed White as an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] of the Supreme Court of the United States. In 1910, President [[William Howard Taft]] elevated him to the position of Chief Justice. The appointment surprised many contemporaries, as Taft was a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. White served as Chief Justice until his death in 1921, when he was succeeded by Taft.

He was generally a conservative member of the court. He sided with the Supreme Court majority in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', which upheld the legality of state [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] to provide "[[separate but equal]]" public facilities in the United States, despite protections of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to equal protection of the laws. In one of several challenges to [[Southern United States|Southern states']] [[grandfather clause]]s, used to [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchise]] [[African-American]] voters at the turn of the century, he wrote for a unanimous court in ''[[Guinn v. United States]]'', which struck down many Southern states' grandfather clauses. He also wrote the opinion in the ''[[Selective Draft Law Cases]]'', which upheld the constitutionality of [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]].

==Early life and education==
White was born in 1845 in his parents' plantation house, now known as the [[Edward Douglass White House]], near the town of Thibodauxville (now [[Thibodaux, Louisiana|Thibodaux]]) in [[Lafourche Parish, Louisiana|Lafourche Parish]] in south [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Edward Douglass White House / Edward Douglass White Louisiana State Commemorative Area|url={{NHLS url|id=76000964}} |format=pdf|date=April 1976 |author=George R. Adams and Ralph Christian |publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of [[Edward Douglass White Sr.]], a former [[governor of Louisiana]], and Catherine Ringgold. He was a grandson of Dr. [[James White (North Carolina politician)|James White]], a [[U.S. representative]], physician, and judge.

On his mother's side, he was the grandson of [[Tench Ringgold]], appointed as a [[U.S. marshal]] of the [[District of Columbia]] under the [[James Monroe]] and [[Andrew Jackson]] administrations. He was also related on his maternal side to the [[Lee family]] of [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]]. The White family's large [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] in Louisiana was based on cultivating and processing for market [[sugar cane]], depending on the extensive labor of [[Slavery|slaves]].

White's paternal ancestors were of [[Irish American|Irish Catholic descent]], and he was reared in that religion, a devout [[Roman Catholic]] his entire life. He studied first at the [[College of the Immaculate Conception (New Orleans)|Jesuit College]] in [[New Orleans]], then at [[Mount Saint Mary's University|Mount St. Mary's College]] near [[Emmitsburg, Maryland|Emmitsburg]], [[Maryland]]. Last, he attended [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], where he was a member of the [[Philodemic Society]]. After the [[American Civil War]], he returned to academic work and studied law at the [[Tulane University|University of Louisiana]] (now Tulane University) in [[New Orleans]].

==American Civil War service==
White's studies at Georgetown were interrupted by the Civil War. It has been suggested {{by whom|date=June 2018}} that he returned to [[Bayou Lafourche]], where he purportedly enlisted as an [[infantry]]man in the [[Confederate States Army]] under General [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor]] and eventually attained the rank of [[lieutenant]]. This is questionable {{by whom|date=June 2018}}, as his widowed mother had remarried and was living with the rest of the family in New Orleans at the time. When he returned to Louisiana, it was probably to his primary home in New Orleans.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

An apocryphal account states that White was almost captured by General [[Godfrey Weitzel]]'s [[Union army]] when they invaded Bayou Lafourche in October 1862, but that he evaded capture by hiding beneath hay in a barn. It is possible that White enlisted in the Lafourche militia, as its muster rolls are not complete. There is no documentation, however, that White served in any Confederate volunteer unit or militia unit engaged in campaigns in the Lafourche area.

Another account suggests that he was assigned as an aide to Confederate General [[William Beall|W. N. R. Beall]] and accompanied him to [[Port Hudson, Louisiana|Port Hudson]], Louisiana, which had a garrison of 18,000 Confederate soldiers, but a numerically superior Union force surrounded it. After a [[siege]] lasting from May 21 to July 8, 1863 (the longest siege in North American history), the Confederate forces unconditionally surrendered after learning of the [[Siege of Vicksburg|fall of Vicksburg]] to the Union. White's presence at Port Hudson, when he was 18 years old, is supported by a secondhand account of a postwar dinner conversation he had with Senator [[Knute Nelson]] of Minnesota, a Union veteran of Port Hudson, and another recounted by Admiral [[George Dewey]] (then a Federal naval officer at Port Hudson), in both of which White referred to being part of the besieged forces. But, White's name does not appear on any list of prisoners captured at Port Hudson. According to another account of questionable reliability, White was supposedly sent to a [[Mississippi]] [[prisoner of war camp]]. (As practically all Confederate soldiers of enlisted rank of the Port Hudson garrison were paroled, and officers sent to prison in New Orleans and later to [[Johnson's Island, Ohio]], this account is likely not true.) When White was paroled, he supposedly returned to the family plantation, to find it abandoned, the canefields barren, and the place nearly empty of most former slaves.

The only "hard" evidence of White's Confederate service consists of an account of his capture on March 12, 1865 in an action in [[Morganza, Louisiana|Morganza]] in [[Pointe Coupee Parish]], which is contained in the [[Official Records of the American Civil War]], and his service records in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]], documenting his subsequent imprisonment in New Orleans and parole in April 1865. These records confirm his service as a lieutenant in Captain W. B. Barrow's company of a Louisiana cavalry regiment, for all practical purposes a loosely organized band of irregulars or "scouts" (guerrillas). One organizing officer of this regiment, which was sometimes called "Barrow's Regiment" or the "9th Louisiana Cavalry Regiment," was Major Robert Pruyn. Pruyn (a postwar mayor of Baton Rouge, Louisiana) served as courier relaying messages from Port Hudson's commander, General [[Franklin Gardner]], to General [[Joseph E. Johnston]], crossing the Union siege lines by swimming the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]. Pruyn escaped from Port Hudson prior to its surrender in the same manner. According to another account, after White was paroled in April 1865 and following the surrender of the western Confederate forces, he ended his military career by walking (his clothing in rags) to a comrade's family home in Livonia in [[Pointe Coupee Parish]].

White's Civil War service was taken as a matter of common knowledge at the time of his initial nomination to the United States Supreme Court, and the ''Confederate Veteran'' periodical, published for the United Confederate Veterans, congratulated him upon his confirmation. White was one of three ex-Confederate soldiers to serve on the Supreme Court. The others were Associate Justices [[Lucius Q. C. Lamar|Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar (II)]] of Mississippi and [[Horace Harmon Lurton]] of Tennessee. The Court's other ex-Confederate, Associate Justice [[Howell Edmunds Jackson]], had held a civil position under the Confederate government.

White was a member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in the aftermath of the death of the Confederacy. Later, while on the Supreme Court, he approved of the film [[The Birth of a Nation]], which helped reignite the Klan in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, David M. Hooded Americanism: The First Century of the Ku Klux Klan, 1865-1965. Doubleday, Garden City, N.Y, 1965., p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1877, White served on the Reception Committee of the Knights of Momus in New Orleans, whose widely condemned extreme political satire of Reconstruction and its aftermath earned even the vilification of the Krewe of Rex, according to The New Orleans newspaper ''The Republican'' of February 14, 1877.

==Political career==
[[File:Senatorwhite.jpg|left|thumb|Edward White as a U.S. Senator]]
While living on his family's abandoned plantation, White began his legal studies. He enrolled at the [[Tulane University|University of Louisiana]] in New Orleans to complete his study of the law, at what is now known as the [[Tulane University Law School]].  He subsequently was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in New Orleans in 1868.

White briefly served in the Louisiana State Senate in 1874, a year marked by interracial violence in political campaigns and elections. He was appointed as an Associate Justice of the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]], serving from 1879 to 1880. He was politically affiliated with Governor [[Francis T. Nicholls]], a former Confederate general who served 1877 to 1880, and later was elected again, serving 1888 to 1892.

White later became famous in Louisiana for helping to abolish the [[Louisiana State Lottery Company|Louisiana Lottery]], considered a hotbed of corruption.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} A case challenging the lottery reached the state's Supreme Court, which in 1894 ordered the state to discontinue the gaming.

The state's legislature appointed White to the United States Senate in 1891 to succeed [[James B. Eustis]]. He served until his resignation on March 12, 1894, when he was nominated by President [[Grover Cleveland]] (D) to be an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] after the failed nominations of [[William B. Hornblower]] and [[Wheeler Hazard Peckham]]. In 1896 White sided with the six justices whose majority opinion in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' approved segregation. (One justice abstained, so only eight were voting.)

==The White Court, 1910&amp;ndash;1921==
[[File:Edward Douglass White in Harpers.png|thumb|White as he appears in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' in 1910.]]

In 1910, he was elevated by President [[William Howard Taft]] to the position of [[Chief Justice of the United States]] upon the death of [[Melville Fuller]]. At the time, his was a controversial appointment: first, White was a Democrat while Taft was a Republican. The media of the day widely expected Taft to name Republican Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] to the post. Second, White was the first Associate Justice to be appointed as Chief Justice since [[John Rutledge]] in 1795. Some historians believe that President Taft appointed White, who was 65 years old at the time and overweight, in the hope that White would not serve all that long and that Taft himself might be appointed to succeed him. Following White's death in 1921, Taft was indeed appointed as his successor, making White the only Chief Justice to be followed in office by the president who appointed him.

White was generally seen as one of the more [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] members of the court. He originated the term, the "[[Rule of Reason]]." But, White also wrote the 1916 decision upholding the constitutionality of the [[Adamson Act]], which mandated a maximum [[eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] for railroad employees.

As Chief Justice at a time when the Court's work was carried out with more than 8,000 cases brought each year before the court, and only a few clerks to work for all the members of the Court, the Chief Justice held weekly meetings with fellow jurists, assigned all the cases and wrote the majority opinions in 711 cases, as well as 155 dissenting opinions, all opposing income taxes.  White wrote for a unanimous Court in ''[[Guinn v. United States]]'' (1915), which invalidated the Oklahoma and Maryland grandfather clauses (and, by extension, those in other Southern states) as "repugnant to the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] and therefore null and void."&lt;ref name="delehant"/&gt; But, Southern states quickly devised other methods to continue their disfranchisement of blacks (and in some cases, many poor whites) that withstood Court scrutiny.

In 1918, the ''[[Selective Draft Law Cases]]'' upheld the [[Selective Service Act of 1917]], and more generally, upheld [[conscription in the United States]], which President Taft said was "one of his great opinions."&lt;ref name="delehant"&gt;{{cite journal | title= A Judicial Revisitation Finds Kneedler v. Lane Not So 'Amazing' | last= Delehant | first= John W. | journal= [[ABA Journal]] | date= December 1967 | volume= 53 | page= 1132 | authorlink= John Wayne Delehant | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rpOkMyVjGKQC&amp;pg=PA1132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Chief Justice, White swore in presidents [[Woodrow Wilson]] (twice) and [[Warren G. Harding]].

Chief Justice White was one of thirteen Catholic justices{{spaced ndash}} of 112 total through the 2009 appointment of Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]]{{spaced ndash}}in the history of the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/adh_sc.html Religious affiliation of Supreme Court justices] Justice [[Sherman Minton]] converted to [[Catholicism]] after his retirement.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
White married Leita Montgomery Kent, the widow of Linden Kent, on November 6, 1894, in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chadwick |first1=Georgia |title=Looking Out on Royal Street |journal=De Novo, the newsletter of the Law Library of Louisiana |date=Spring 2008 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=6–8 |url=https://www.lasc.org/law_library/denovo/2008_Spring_DeNovo.pdf |accessdate=September 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
White died in office and his remains were buried at the [[Oak Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Oak Hill Cemetery]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The Georgetown graveyard overlooks Rock Creek; also interred there are Associate Justice [[Noah Swayne]] and "almost-Justice" [[Edwin M. Stanton]].  Chief Justice [[Salmon P. Chase]] was also buried there, but his body was transferred after 14 years to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]'s [[Spring Grove Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourthistory.org/04_library/subs_volumes/04_c20_e.html |title=Here Lies the Supreme Court: Gravesites of the Justices |author=Christensen, George A. |date=1983 |work=Supreme Court Historical Society Yearbook 1983 |accessdate=November 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050903032026/http://www.supremecourthistory.org/04_library/subs_volumes/04_c20_e.html |archivedate=September 3, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, George A., ''Here Lies the Supreme Court: Revisited'', ''Journal of Supreme Court History'', Volume 33 Issue 1, Pages 17 - 41 (February 19, 2008), [[University of Alabama]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Generally Accepted Accounting Principles''' (GAAP) of [[Canada]] provides the framework of broad guidelines, conventions, rules and procedures of [[accounting]].

==History==

In Canada, professional development paralleled that of the [[United States]].  In 1936, the Terminology Committee of the [[Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants]] (CICA) formed and was asked to take steps to encourage greater uniformity in the use of accounting terms by its members.  In 1939, the establishment of a joint research program with [[Queen's University]] culminated in the establishment in 1946 of the Accounting and Auditing Research Committee.  The aim of the committee was to improve the quality of judgement exercised in both [[accounting]] and [[auditing]] and to provide guidelines for communicating financial information and economic facts and for auditing procedures and techniques.

In 1973, the Accounting and Auditing Research Committee (AARC) gave way to two new committees – the Accounting Research Committee (ARC) and the Auditing Standards Committee (ASC).  A deviation from prior policy was the invitation to other organizations to participate in ARC work by appointing up to six of its proposed members.  The chief aim of the expanded structure is to continue the search for ways of increasing the thrust and scope of accounting and auditing research.  In 1982, ARCs name was changed to the Accounting Standards Committee (ASC) and in 1991 to the Accounting Standards Board (AcSB).

For a number of years prior to 1968, the Research Committee issued bulletins on financial disclosure, accounting principles, terminology, reporting and auditing procedures.  In 1968, these bulletins were consolidated to form a major part of the CICA Handbook.  Since 1968, the Handbook has been constantly updated by inclusion of approved exposure drafts on various current topics.

The handbook is currently updated by a number of groups, including the AcSB for profit and not for profit organizations, the Public Sector Accounting Standards board for the public sector, and the Auditing Standards Board for the auditing sections.

In early 2006, the AcSB decided to completely converge Canadian GAAP with international GAAP, i.e. [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS), as set by the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB), for most entities that must follow AcSB standards. For publicly accountable enterprises, IFRS will become mandatory in Canada for fiscal periods beginning after January 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cica.ca/ifrs/faqs/item2424.aspx When will this transition take place?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Privately accountable enterprises will have the option of adopting IFRS, or a new set of standards called Accounting Standard for Private Enterprises (ASPE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cica.ca/privateenterprises/index.aspx |title=Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises |publisher=Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants |accessdate=25 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
To develop [[financial accounting]] in Canada a group of organizations influence its evolution: The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA), the [[Certified General Accountant]]s (CGA), the [[Society of Management Accountants of Canada]] (CMA), and the Canadian Academic Accounting Association (CAAA).

These groups' activities have shaped accounting thought through:

#Education programs;
#Publication of journals; and
#Sponsorship and publication of special studies and research monographs

Particularly active in monograph publication is the Canadian Certified General Accountants' Research Foundation incorporated in 1979 to foster and promote the advancement of education and research in accounting.  The association also publishes the GAAP Guide, which summarizes and compares Canadian, United States and international accounting standards.

'''Sir Gerrard Jude "Gerry" Robinson''' (born 23 October 1948, [[Dunfanaghy]], [[County Donegal]], [[Ireland]]) is an Irish-born British business executive and television presenter. He is the former non-executive Chairman of [[Allied Domecq]] and the ex-Chairman/chief executive of [[Granada plc|Granada]].

==Early life==
The ninth of 10 children born to Anthony and Elizabeth Robinson, an Irish father and a [[Scotland|Scottish]] mother, Robinson moved with his family to England from [[County Donegal]] in his early teens. He briefly trained to become a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priest at [[Castle Head, Grange-over-Sands|St. Mary's Seminary]] of the [[Holy Ghost Fathers]] at Castlehead, [[Grange-over-Sands]], [[Lancashire]]. He began a career in accounting in 1965 as a clerk with the [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox Toys]] company. While with the firm, he progressed through various accounting roles to become Chief Management Accountant in 1974. He also, during that time, qualified as an Associate Chartered Management Accountant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personallyspeakingbureau.com/speaker/gerry-robinson-sir/|title=Gerry Robinson, Sir - Personally Speaking Bureau|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1974, he left Matchbox to work for [[Lex Vehicle Leasing]] as a management accountant. He then rose through the company before being appointed finance director. In 1980, he joined the UK franchise of [[Coca-Cola]], owned at that time by [[Grand Metropolitan]]. In 1983 he was appointed managing director of Grand Metropolitan's international services division. In 1987 he led the successful £163m management buyout of the loss-making contract services and catering division of [[Compass Group]], known as Compass Caterers. He joined [[Granada plc|Granada]] as CEO in 1991, and soon ousted Granada's chairman, [[David Plowright]] in 1992, which led [[John Cleese]] to call Robinson "an upstart caterer ".&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1527549/David-Plowright.html|title=David Plowright obituary|publisher=''The Telegraph''|date=30 August 2006|accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson steered the company through various mergers, and hostile takeovers including [[London Weekend Television]] (1993) and [[Forte Group]] (1996). In 1999 Robinson was the subject of a biography, ''Lord of the Dance'', written by business journalist [[William Kay (journalist)|William Kay]], and published by Orion Business Books {{ISBN|0752810480}}. In 2005 he made an unsuccessful attempt to oust Doug Flynn as CEO of [[Rentokil Initial]] and install himself as Executive chairman for a 5% stake in the company, then valued at £56M. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Television==
Robinson's first foray into broadcasting was a revival of the [[BBC]]'s [[Troubleshooter (TV series)|''Troubleshooter'']] show, originally fronted by Sir [[John Harvey-Jones]] in the early 1990s. Titled ''I'll Show Them Who's Boss'' and co-produced by the [[Open University]], in 2004 he went into struggling businesses to try to turn them round by advice and mentoring.

In January 2007 following a similar format, he presented a three-part series, ''[[Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHS?]]'' as he attempted to reduce waiting lists at [[Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust|Rotherham General Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open2.net/nhs/about_the_series.html|title=BBC/OU Open2.net, "Can Gerry Robinson Fix The NHS?"|publisher=Open2.net|date=|accessdate= 14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned a year later for a sequel, ''Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHS? One Year On''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open2.net/nhs/oneyearon/oneyearonsummary.html|title=BBC/OU Open2.net – Can Gerry Robinson Fix The NHS? One Year On|publisher=Open2.net|date=22 November 2007|accessdate=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, Robinson presented a programme in a similar format entitled ''Can Gerry Robinson Fix Dementia Care Homes?''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can Gerry Robinson Fix Dementia Care Homes?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00pf0s2|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 January 2014|author=British Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009 he presented a special edition of ''[[The Money Programme]]'' entitled ''Gerry Robinson's Car Crash'' investigating the history and future of the [[British motor industry]]. He regularly appears on British TV as a celebrity businessman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1831101/bio IMDb bio]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009 he started a TV series called ''Gerry's Big Decision'', in which he reviews struggling companies and decides whether it is worth investing his own money to save them.
From 14 January – 18 February 2011 he presented [[BBC2]] show ''Can't Take It with You'', which helps people to write their [[will (law)|will]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00xk532]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other affiliations==
Robinson also served as chairman of the [[Arts Council England]] for six years from 1998, in which capacity he was one of the many victims of a spoof by British comedian [[Ali G]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gerry-robinson-news.newslib.com Gerry Robinson official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Robinson has divorced and remarried and has four children. He lives in Raphoe,Co Donegal &lt;ref&gt;http://www.oakfieldpark.com/ Oakfield Park&lt;/ref&gt; ; he established a botanical garden with a narrow gauge railway – the Difflin Lake Railway – which is open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2007/10/07/story27146.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214073506/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2007/10/07/story27146.asp |archivedate=14 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Although originally a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] supporter, he supported [[Tony Blair]] and starred in a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[party political broadcast|election broadcast]], saying that ''"... frankly, there's only one party that can represent Britain best, getting business right, and that's New Labour"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardianlies.com/Granada%20TV/page3.html|title=Granada TV Part Two: Comrades at the Top|publisher=GuardianLies.com|accessdate=14 July 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911030207/http://www.guardianlies.com/Granada%20TV/page3.html|archivedate=11 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, Robinson was one of four Labour donors who expressed their concerns with [[Gordon Brown]]'s leadership and stated he would not be contributing any more money to the Labour Party until there was a change of leader. He had donated some £70,000 to the party between 2001 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7479840.stm|title=Labour donor says Brown must go|publisher=BBC News|date=29 June 2008|accessdate=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1398">The '''Global Data Synchronization Network''' (GDSN) is an [[internet]]-based, interconnected network of interoperable [[data pool]]s and a global registry known as the [[GS1]] Global Registry, that enables companies around the globe to exchange standardised and synchronised [[supply chain]] data with their trading partners using a standardised [[Global Product Classification]].

GDSN assures that data exchanged between trading partners is accurate and compliant with universally supported standards. GDSN consists of supplier/retailer trading partner, data pools that hold and process trading partner data and the GS1 Global Registry, a directory that helps locate data sources and keep relationships between trading partners in sync.

==Global identification numbers==
The [[Global Location Number]] (GLN) and the [[Global Trade Item Number]] (GTIN) are the global identification numbers in the GDSN. The GLN is the identifier for [[Legal person|legal entities]], trading partners and locations while the GTIN is the identifiers for trade items.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epcglobalinc.org/about/media_centre/EPCglobal_and_GDSN_v4_0_Final.pdf EPCglobal: The EPCgloabal Network and the Global Data Synchronization Network (GDSN)]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was on the Likud list (an alliance of [[Herut]] and several other right-wing parties) for the [[Israeli legislative election, 1973|1973 elections]], but failed to win a seat. However, he entered the Knesset on 19 January 1977 as a replacement for [[Binyamin Halevi]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mkindexbyknesset_eng.asp?knesset=8 Knesset Members in the Eighth Knesset] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|May 1977 elections]], and again in [[Israeli legislative election, 1981|1981]] and [[Israeli legislative election, 1984|1984]], serving as Deputy [[Finance Minister of Israel|Minister of Finance]] between 1981 and 1984. He became a member of the Likud secretariat and chairman of its municipal branch, as well as chairing the party's [[Petah Tikva]] branch and editing the party magazine ''BeEretz Yisrael''.

Although he lost his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1988|1988 elections]], Kaufman returned to the Knesset on 8 October 1990 as a replacement for [[Zalman Shoval]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mkindexbyknesset_eng.asp?knesset=12 Knesset Members in the Twelfth Knesset] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; He retained his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1992|1992 elections]], but died in office on 7 August 1995.

'''Herminie Cadolle''' (1845–1926) was the French inventor of the modern [[bra]] and founder of the Cadolle [[lingerie]] house.

Cadolle was a close friend of the [[France|French]] insurrectionist [[Louise Michel]], and it was this connection that led her to leave for the safety of [[Buenos Aires]]. Here, in 1887, Herminie opened a shop selling made-to-measure underwear.

Returning to [[Paris]] in 1889, she opened a similar lingerie workshop on the street ''[[Chaussée d'Antin]]'', where she invented a two-piece undergarment called ''le bien-être'' (the wellbeing). The lower part was a corset for the waist and the upper supported the breasts by means of shoulder straps. She exhibited at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Great Exposition of 1900]] and by 1905 the upper half was being sold separately as a ''soutien-gorge'' (literally, "support for the throat", but ''gorge'' in old French meant breast), the name by which bras are still known in France.

Herminie became a fitter of bras to queens, princesses, dancers, and actresses. [[Mata Hari]] was among her customers. She was also the first to use cloth incorporating rubber (elastic) thread. Cadolle's business is still running today.

The ''' Human Genome Project''' ('''HGP''') was an international [[scientific research]] project with the goal of determining the sequence of nucleotide [[base pairs]] that make up human [[DNA]], and of identifying and mapping all of the [[gene]]s of the [[human genome]] from both a physical and  a functional standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Robert Krulwich]] |date=2003 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/genome/ |title=Cracking the Code of Life |medium=Television Show |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains the world's largest collaborative biological project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://battelle.org/docs/default-document-library/economic_impact_of_the_human_genome_project.pdf|title= Economic Impact of the Human Genome Project – Battelle| accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the idea was picked up in 1984 by the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] when the planning started, the project formally launched in 1990 and was declared complete on April 14, 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/11006943/human-genome-project-completion-frequently-asked-questions/|title=Human Genome Project Completion: Frequently Asked Questions|author=|date=|website=National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Funding came from the US government through the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) as well as numerous other groups from around the world. A parallel project was conducted outside government by the [[Celera Corporation]], or Celera Genomics, which was formally launched in 1998. Most of the government-sponsored sequencing was performed in twenty universities and research centers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Germany, Spain and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genome.gov/11006943| title=Human Genome Project Completion: Frequently Asked Questions|work=genome.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Human Genome Project originally aimed to map the [[nucleotides]] contained in a human [[haploid]] [[reference genome]] (more than three billion).  The "genome" of any given individual is unique; mapping the "human genome" involved sequencing a small number of individuals and then assembling these together to get a complete sequence for each chromosome. Therefore, the finished human genome is a mosaic, not representing any one individual.

== Human Genome Project ==

=== History ===
[[File:Dna-split.png|right]]
The Human Genome Project was a 15-year-long, publicly funded project initiated in 1990 with the objective of determining the DNA sequence of the entire euchromatic human genome within 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Human Genome Project: Sequencing the Human Genome {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable|url = http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/dna-sequencing-technologies-key-to-the-human-828|website = www.nature.com|access-date = 2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1985, Robert Sinsheimer organized a workshop to discuss sequencing the human genome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sinsheimer|first1=Robert|title=The Santa Cruz Workshop, May 1985|journal=Genomics|date=1989|volume=5|issue=4|pages=954–956|doi=10.1016/0888-7543(89)90142-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; but for a number of reasons the NIH was uninterested in pursuing the proposal. The following March, the Santa Fe Workshop was organized by [[Charles DeLisi]] and David Smith of the Department of Energy's Office of Health and Environmental Research (OHER).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeLisi|first1=Charles|title=Conferences That Changed the World|journal=Nature|date=October 2008|pages=876–877|doi=10.1038/455876a|bibcode=2008Natur.455..876D|volume=455|issue=7215|pmid=18923499}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time [[Renato Dulbecco]] proposed whole genome sequencing in an essay in Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dulbecco|first1=Renato|title=Turning Point in Cancer Research, Sequencing the Human Genome|journal=Science|date=1986|volume=231|pages=1055–1056|doi=10.1126/science.3945817|pmid=3945817|issue=4742|bibcode=1986Sci...231.1055D}}&lt;/ref&gt;  James Watson followed two months later with a workshop held at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

The fact that the Santa Fe workshop was motivated and supported by a Federal Agency opened a path, albeit a difficult and tortuous one,&lt;ref name="Cook-Deegan"&gt;Gene Wars, Op.Cit. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; for converting the idea into a public policy in the [[United States]].  In a memo to the Assistant Secretary for Energy Research (Alvin Trivelpiece), Charles DeLisi, who was then Director of the OHER, outlined a broad plan for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/556935/discover?filtertype=author&amp;filter_relational_operator=equals&amp;filter=DeLisi%2C+Charles|title=Search|work=georgetown.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This started a long and complex chain of events which led to approved reprogramming of funds that enabled the OHER to launch the Project in 1986, and to recommend the first line item for the HGP, which was in President Reagan's 1988 budget submission,&lt;ref name="Cook-Deegan" /&gt; and ultimately approved by the Congress.  Of particular importance in Congressional approval was the advocacy of Senator [[Peter Domenici]], whom DeLisi had befriended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/new/html/Mon_Jan_8_141714_2001.html|title=President Clinton Awards the Presidential Citizens Medals|work=nara.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Domenici chaired the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, as well as the Budget Committee, both of which were key in the DOE budget process.  Congress added a comparable amount to the NIH budget, thereby beginning official funding by both agencies.

[[Alvin Trivelpiece]] sought and obtained the approval of DeLisi's proposal by  Deputy Secretary [[William Flynn Martin]]. This chart&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Trivelpiece/HGP%20Presenation.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; was used in the spring of 1986 by Trivelpiece, then Director of the Office of Energy Research in the Department of Energy, to brief Martin and Under Secretary Joseph Salgado regarding his intention to reprogram $4 million to initiate the project with the approval of [[John S. Herrington|Secretary Herrington]]. This reprogramming was followed by a line item budget of $16 million in the [[Reagan Administration]]’s 1987 budget submission to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeLisi|first=Charles|title=Meetings that changed the world: Santa Fe 1986: Human genome baby-steps|journal=Nature|date=2008|volume=455|issue=7215|pages=876–877|bibcode = 2008Natur.455..876D |doi = 10.1038/455876a|pmid=18923499}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It subsequently passed both Houses. The Project was planned for 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeLisi|first=Charles|title=The Human Genome Project|journal=American Scientist|date=1988|volume=76|issue=5|page=488|bibcode = 1988AmSci..76..488D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidate technologies were already being considered for the proposed undertaking at least as early as 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeLisi |first=Charles |date=2001 |url=http://genome.gsc.riken.go.jp/hgmis/publicat/hgn/v11n3/05delisi.html |title=Genomes: 15 Years Later A Perspective by Charles Deli, HEP Pioneer |journal=Human Genome News |volume=11 |pages=3–4 |accessdate=2005-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040904183906/http://genome.gsc.riken.go.jp/hgmis/publicat/hgn/v11n3/05delisi.html |archivedate=September 4, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the two major funding agencies, DOE and [[NIH]], developed a memorandum of understanding in order to coordinate plans and set the clock for the initiation of the Project to 1990.&lt;ref name=hgmis&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/about.shtml |title=About the Human Genome Project: What is the Human Genome Project |publisher=The Human Genome Management Information System (HGMIS) |date= 2011-07-18 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, David Galas was Director of the renamed “Office of Biological and Environmental Research” in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science and [[James Watson]] headed the NIH Genome Program. In 1993, Aristides Patrinos succeeded Galas and [[Francis Collins]] succeeded [[James Watson]], assuming the role of overall Project Head as Director of the [[United States National Institutes of Health|U.S. National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) National Center for Human Genome Research (which would later become the [[National Human Genome Research Institute]]). A working draft of the genome was announced in 2000 and the papers describing it were published in February 2001. A more complete draft was published in 2003, and genome "finishing" work continued for more than a decade.

The $3-billion project was formally founded in 1990 by the US Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health, and was expected to take 15 years.&lt;ref name=human&gt;{{cite web|author = Human Genome Information Archive|url= http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/about.shtml|title= About the Human Genome Project| publisher=U.S. Department of Energy &amp; Human Genome Project program | accessdate=1  August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the United States, the international [[consortium]] comprised [[geneticist]]s in the United Kingdom, France, Australia, China and myriad other spontaneous relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Collins F|author2= Galas D |url=http://www.genome.gov/10001476 |title=A New Five-Year Plan for the United States: Human Genome Program|publisher=National Human Genome Research Institute |date=1993-10-01 | accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the inflation, the project roughly costed $5 billion.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07323-y|title=Life on Earth to have its DNA analysed in the name of conservation|date=6 November 2018|publisher=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|accessdate=3 December 2018|volume=563|pages=155–156|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-07323-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewin|first1=Harris A.|last2=et al.|title=Earth BioGenome Project: Sequencing life for the future of life|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/4325|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]]|date=2018|volume=115|pages=4325–4333|doi=10.1073/pnas.1720115115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to widespread international cooperation and advances in the field of [[genomics]] (especially in [[sequence analysis]]), as well as major advances in computing technology, a 'rough draft' of the genome was finished in 2000 (announced jointly by U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] and the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] on June 26, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/clinton1.shtml |title=White House Press Release |accessdate=2006-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This first available rough draft [[Genome Project|assembly]] of the genome was completed by the Genome Bioinformatics Group at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], primarily led by then graduate student [[Jim Kent]]. Ongoing [[sequencing]] led to the announcement of the essentially complete [[genome]] on April 14, 2003, two years earlier than planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2940601.stm |title=Human genome finally complete |accessdate=2006-07-22 |date=2003-04-14 |work=BBC News |first=Ivan |last=Noble}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/science/the-human-genome-project-then-and-now.html|title=Human Genome, Then and Now|last=Kolata|first=Gina|date=15 April 2013|work=The New York Times|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2006, another milestone was passed on the way to completion of the project, when the sequence of the [[Chromosome 1 (human)|last chromosome]] was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uklatest/story/0,,-5829253,00.html |title=Guardian Unlimited &amp;#124;UK Latest &amp;#124; Human Genome Project finalised |accessdate=2006-07-22 |work=The Guardian |location=London }} {{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State of completion ===
The project was not able to sequence all the DNA found in [[List of distinct cell types in the adult human body|human cells]].  It sequenced only ''[[Euchromatin|euchromatic]]'' regions of the genome, which make up 92% of the human genome.  The other regions, called ''[[heterochromatin|heterochromatic]]'', are found in [[centromeres]] and [[telomeres]], and were not sequenced under the project.&lt;ref name=Genoscope&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Genome Project FAQ|url=http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/spip/The-Human-Genome-Project.html?artsuite=1#FAQ2|website=Genoscope|publisher=Centre National de Séquençage|accessdate=12 February 2015|date=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Human Genome Project was declared complete in April 2003. An initial rough draft of the human genome was available in June 2000 and by February 2001 a working draft had been completed and published followed by the final sequencing mapping of the human genome on April 14, 2003. Although this was reported to cover 99% of the euchromatic human genome with 99.99% accuracy, a major quality assessment of the human genome sequence was published on May 27, 2004 indicating over 92% of sampling exceeded 99.99% accuracy which was within the intended goal.&lt;ref&gt;

In March 2009, the [[Genome Reference Consortium]] (GRC) released a more accurate version of the human genome, but that still left more than 300 gaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dolgin|first=Elie|date=2009-12-17|title=Human genomics: The genome finishers|journal=Nature|volume=462|issue=7275|pages=843–845|doi=10.1038/462843a|issn=1476-4687|pmid=20016572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, the GRC still indicated 514 gaps, most of which are annotated as "stalled" or "under investigation/review", so it seems they will not be resolved any time soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/grc/human/issues?filters=type:gap&amp;asm=GRCh37.p13|title=Human Genome Issues|last=|first=|date=|website=Genome Reference Consortium|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications and proposed benefits ==
The sequencing of the human genome holds benefits for many fields, from [[molecular medicine]] to [[human evolution]]. The Human Genome Project, through its sequencing of the DNA, can help us understand diseases including: [[genotype|genotyping]] of specific [[virus]]es to direct appropriate treatment; identification of [[mutation]]s linked to different forms of [[cancer]]; the design of medication and more accurate prediction of their effects; advancement in [[forensics|forensic]] applied sciences;  [[biofuel]]s and other energy applications; [[agriculture]], [[animal husbandry]], [[bioprocessing]]; [[risk assessment]];  [[bioarcheology]], [[anthropology]] and [[evolution]]. Another proposed benefit is the commercial development of [[genomics]] research related to DNA based products, a multibillion-dollar industry.

The sequence of the DNA is stored in [[database]]s available to anyone on the [[Internet]]. The U.S. [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (and sister organizations in Europe and Japan) house the gene sequence in a database known as [[GenBank]], along with sequences of known and hypothetical genes and proteins. Other organizations, such as the [[UCSC Genome Browser]] at the University of California, Santa Cruz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://genome.ucsc.edu|title= An Overview of the Human Genome Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ensembl]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ensembl.org|title=Ensembl Genome Browser|work=ensembl.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; present additional data and annotation and powerful tools for visualizing and searching it. [[Computer program]]s have been developed to analyze the data, because the data itself is difficult to interpret without such programs.  Generally speaking, advances in genome sequencing technology have followed Moore’s Law, a concept from computer science which states that integrated circuits can increase in complexity at an exponential rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mardis|first1=E.|title=The impact of next-generation sequencing technology on genetics|journal=Trends in Genetics|date=2008|volume=24|issue=3|pages=133–41|doi=10.1016/j.tig.2007.12.007|pmid=18262675  |pmc=2680276}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the speeds at which whole genomes can be sequenced can increase at a similar rate, as was seen during the development of the above-mentioned Human Genome Project.

== Techniques and analysis ==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
The process of identifying the boundaries between genes and other features in a raw DNA sequence is called [[genome annotation]] and is in the domain of [[bioinformatics]]. While expert biologists make the best annotators, their work proceeds slowly, and computer programs are increasingly used to meet the high-throughput demands of genome sequencing projects. Beginning in 2008, a new technology known as [[RNA-seq]] was introduced that allowed scientists to directly sequence the messenger RNA in cells. This replaced previous methods of annotation, which relied on inherent properties of the DNA sequence, with direct measurement, which was much more accurate. Today, annotation of the human genome and other genomes relies primarily on deep sequencing of the transcripts in every human tissue using RNA-seq. These experiments have revealed that over 90% of genes contain at least one and usually several alternative splice variants, in which the [[exons]] are combined in different ways to produce 2 or more gene products from the same locus.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The genome published by the HGP does not represent the sequence of every individual's genome. It is the combined mosaic of a small number of anonymous donors, all of European origin. The HGP genome is a scaffold for future work in identifying differences among individuals. Subsequent projects sequenced the genomes of multiple distinct ethnic groups, though as of today there is still only one "reference genome."{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

=== Findings ===
Key findings of the draft (2001) and complete (2004) genome sequences include:

=== Accomplishment ===

[[Image:Wellcome genome bookcase.png|thumb|The first printout of the human genome to be presented as a series of books, displayed at the [[Wellcome Collection]], London]]

The Human Genome Project was started in 1990 with the goal of sequencing and identifying all three billion chemical units in the human genetic instruction set, finding the genetic roots of disease and then developing treatments. It is considered a [[megaproject]] because the human genome has approximately 3.3 billion [[base pair]]s. With the sequence in hand, the next step was to identify the genetic variants that increase the risk for common diseases like cancer and diabetes.&lt;ref name=hgmis/&gt;&lt;ref name=wellcome&gt;{{cite web|author= Wellcome Sanger Institute|url= http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/history/hgp/|title= The Human Genome Project: a new reality|publisher= Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Genome Research Limited|accessdate= 1  August 2013|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130801231124/http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/history/hgp/|archivedate= 2013-08-01|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was far too expensive at that time to think of sequencing patients’ whole genomes. So the National Institutes of Health embraced the idea for a "shortcut", which was to look just at sites on the genome where many people have a variant DNA unit. The theory behind the shortcut was that, since the major diseases are common, so too would be the genetic variants that caused them. [[Natural selection]] keeps the human genome free of variants that damage health before children are grown, the theory held, but fails against variants that strike later in life, allowing them to become quite common (In 2002 the National Institutes of Health started a $138 million project called the [[HapMap]] to catalog the common variants in European, East Asian and African genomes).&lt;ref name=naid&gt;{{cite journal|author =Naidoo N|author2 =Pawitan Y|author3 =Soong R|author4 =Cooper DN|author5 = Ku CS |title=Human genetics and genomics a decade after the release of the draft sequence of the human genome | journal=Hum Genomics |volume= 5|issue=6 |pages= 577–622| date=2011 |pmid=22155605 |pmc=3525251 |doi=10.1186/1479-7364-5-6-577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genome was broken into smaller pieces; approximately 150,000 [[base pair]]s in length.&lt;ref name=wellcome/&gt; These pieces were then ligated into a type of vector known as "[[bacterial artificial chromosome]]s", or BACs, which are derived from bacterial chromosomes which have been genetically engineered. The vectors containing the genes can be inserted into bacteria where they are copied by the bacterial [[DNA replication]] machinery. Each of these pieces was then sequenced separately as a small [[Shotgun sequencing|"shotgun"]] project and then assembled. The larger, 150,000 base pairs go together to create chromosomes. This is known as the [[Shotgun sequencing#Hierarchical Shotgun sequencing|"hierarchical shotgun"]] approach, because the genome is first broken into relatively large chunks, which are then mapped to chromosomes before being selected for sequencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~edy/genome/celera.html|title=Celera: A Unique Approach to Genome Sequencing | work= ocf.berkeley.edu|date=2006|publisher=Biocomputing | accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =Davidson College |url= http://www.bio.davidson.edu/courses/genomics/method/shotgun.html|title=

Funding came from the US government through the National Institutes of Health in the United States, and a UK charity organization, the [[Wellcome Trust]], as well as numerous other groups from around the world. The funding supported a number of large sequencing centers including those at [[Whitehead Institute]], the [http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/who-we-are/sanger-institute Wellcome Sanger Institute] (then called The Sanger Centre) based at the [[Wellcome Genome Campus]], [[Washington University in St. Louis]], and [[Baylor College of Medicine]].&lt;ref name=human/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Human Genome Project Information Archive|url=http://web.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/research/centers.shtml |title= U.S. &amp; International HGP Research Sites| date=2013|publisher= U.S. Department of Energy &amp; Human Genome Project | accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) served as an important channel for the involvement of developing countries in the Human Genome Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vizzini|first1=Casimiro|title=The Human Variome Project: Global Coordination in Data Sharing|journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy|date=March 19, 2015|volume=4|issue=1|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/article/2015/human-variome-project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public versus private approaches ==
In 1998, a similar, privately funded quest was launched by the American researcher [[Craig Venter]], and his firm Celera Genomics. Venter was a scientist at the NIH during the early 1990s when the project was initiated. The $300,000,000 Celera effort was intended to proceed at a faster pace and at a fraction of the cost of the roughly $3 billion [[research funding|publicly funded project]]. The Celera approach was able to proceed at a much more rapid rate, and at a lower cost than the public project because it relied upon data made available by the publicly funded project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The sequence of the human genome|journal = Science|date = 2001-02-16|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 11181995|pages = 1304–1351|volume = 291|issue = 5507|doi = 10.1126/science.1058040|first = J.

O.|last7 = Smith|first8 = M.|last8 = Yandell|first9 = C. A.|last9 = Evans|bibcode = 2001Sci...291.1304V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celera used a technique called [[whole genome shotgun sequencing#Whole genome shotgun sequencing|whole genome shotgun sequencing]], employing [[Shotgun sequencing#Whole genome shotgun sequencing|pairwise end sequencing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1995 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/088875439580219C |title=Pairwise end sequencing: a unified approach to genomic mapping and sequencing |journal=Genomics |volume=26 |pages=345–353 |doi=10.1016/0888-7543(95)80219-C |pmid=7601461 |author=Roach JC |author2=Boysen C |author3=Wang K|author4=Hood L |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been used to sequence bacterial genomes of up to six million base pairs in length, but not for anything nearly as large as the three billion base pair human genome.

Celera initially announced that it would seek patent protection on "only 200–300" genes, but later amended this to seeking "intellectual property protection" on "fully-characterized important structures" amounting to 100–300 targets. The firm eventually filed preliminary ("place-holder") patent applications on 6,500 whole or partial genes.
Celera also promised to publish their findings in accordance with the terms of the 1996 "[[Bermuda Principles|Bermuda Statement]]", by releasing new data annually (the HGP released its new data daily), although, unlike the publicly funded project, they would not permit free redistribution or scientific use of the data. The publicly funded competitors were compelled to release the first draft of the human genome before Celera for this reason. On July 7, 2000, the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group released a first working draft on the web. The scientific community downloaded about 500 GB of information from the UCSC genome server in the first 24 hours of free and unrestricted access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Center for Biomolecular Science &amp; Engineering|url=http://www.cbse.ucsc.edu/research/hgp_race |title=The Human Genome Project Race |publisher=Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering |accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2000, [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] announced that the [[Genome|genome sequence]] could not be patented, and should be made freely available to all researchers. The statement sent Celera's stock plummeting and dragged down the [[biotechnology]]-heavy [[Nasdaq]]. The biotechnology sector lost about $50 billion in [[market capitalization]] in two days.

Although the working draft was announced in June 2000, it was not until February 2001 that Celera and the HGP scientists published details of their drafts. Special issues of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' (which published the publicly funded project's [[Academic publishing|scientific paper]])&lt;ref name="IHGSC"&gt;{{cite journal |author=International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium |title=Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome |journal=Nature |volume=409 |pages=860–921 |date=2001 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6822/pdf/409860a0.pdf |doi=10.1038/35057062 |format=PDF |pmid=11237011 |issue=6822|bibcode=2001Natur.409..860L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' (which published Celera's paper&lt;ref name="Venter"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Venter, JC |title=The sequence of the human genome |journal=Science |volume=291 |pages=1304–1351 |date=2001 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/291/5507/1304.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.1058040 |pmid=11181995 |format=PDF |issue=5507 |display-authors=1 |last2=Adams |first2=MD |last3=Myers |first3=EW |last4=Li |first4=PW |last5=Mural |first5=RJ |last6=Sutton |first6=GG |last7=Smith |first7=HO |last8=Yandell |first8=M |last9=Evans |first9=CA|last10=Holt |first10=Robert A. |last11=Gocayne |first11=Jeannine D. |last12=Amanatides |first12=Peter |last13=Ballew |first13=Richard M. |last14=Huson |first14=Daniel H. |last15=Wortman |first15=Jennifer Russo |last16=Zhang |first16=Qing |last17=Kodira |first17=Chinnappa D. |last18=Zheng |first18=Xiangqun H. |last19=Chen |first19=Lin |last20=Skupski |first20=Marian |last21=Subramanian |first21=Gangadharan |last22=Thomas |first22=Paul D. |last23=Zhang |first23=Jinghui |last24=Gabor Miklos |first24=George L. |last25=Nelson |first25=Catherine |last26=Broder |first26=Samuel |last27=Clark |first27=Andrew G. |last28=Nadeau |first28=Joe |last29=McKusick |first29=Victor A. |last30=Zinder |first30=Norton |bibcode = 2001Sci...291.1304V }}&lt;/ref&gt;) described the methods used to produce the draft sequence and offered analysis of the sequence.  These drafts covered about 83% of the genome (90% of the euchromatic regions with 150,000 gaps and the order and orientation of many segments not yet established).  In February 2001, at the time of the joint publications, [[News release|press releases]] announced that the project had been completed by both groups.  Improved drafts were announced in 2003 and 2005, filling in to approximately 92% of the sequence currently.

== Genome donors ==
In the IHGSC international [[Public sector|public-sector]] HGP, researchers collected blood (female) or sperm (male) samples from a large number of donors. Only a few of many collected samples were processed as DNA resources.  Thus the donor identities were protected so neither donors nor scientists could know whose DNA was sequenced. DNA clones from many different [[DNA library|libraries]] were used in the overall project, with most of those libraries being created by [[Pieter J. de Jong's]].  Much of the sequence (&gt;70%) of the [[reference genome]] produced by the public HGP came from a single anonymous male donor from [[Buffalo, New York]] ([[code name]] RP11).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Osoegawa | first = Kazutoyo | date = 2001 | url = http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/full/11/3/483 | title =  A Bacterial Artificial Chromosome Library for Sequencing the Complete Human Genome  | journal=Genome Research | volume = 11 | pages = 483–96 | doi =  10.1101/gr.169601 | pmid =  11230172 | last2 = Mammoser | first2 = AG | last3 = Wu | first3 = C | last4 = Frengen | first4 = E | last5 = Zeng | first5 = C | last6 = Catanese | first6 = JJ | last7 = De Jong | first7 = PJ | issue = 3 | pmc = 311044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tuzun | first = E | date = 2005 | url = http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v37/n7/full/ng1562.html | title =  Fine-scale structural variation of the human genome  | journal=Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | pages = 727–737 | doi =  10.1038/ng1562 | pmid =  15895083 | issue=7 | display-authors = 1 | last2 = Sharp | first2 = Andrew J | last3 = Bailey | first3 = Jeffrey A | last4 = Kaul | first4 = Rajinder | last5 = Morrison | first5 = V Anne | last6 = Pertz | first6 = Lisa M | last7 = Haugen | first7 = Eric | last8 = Hayden | first8 = Hillary | last9 = Albertson | first9 = Donna }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HGP scientists used [[white blood cell]]s from the blood of two male and two female donors (randomly selected from 20 of each) – each donor yielding a separate DNA library.  One of these libraries (RP11) was used considerably more than others, due to quality considerations.  One minor technical issue is that male samples contain just over half as much DNA from the sex chromosomes (one [[X chromosome]] and one [[Y chromosome]]) compared to female samples (which contain two [[X chromosome]]s). The other 22 chromosomes (the autosomes) are the same for both sexes.

Although the main sequencing phase of the HGP has been completed, studies of DNA variation continued in the [[International HapMap Project]], whose goal was to identify patterns of [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) groups (called [[haplotype]]s, or “haps”). The DNA samples for the HapMap came from a total of 270 individuals: [[Yoruba people]] in [[Ibadan]], [[Nigeria]]; [[Japanese people]] in [[Tokyo]]; [[Han Chinese]] in [[Beijing]]; and the French [[Center for the Study of Human Polymorphisms|Centre d’Etude du Polymorphisme Humain]] (CEPH) resource, which consisted of residents of the United States having ancestry from Western and [[Northern Europe]].

In the Celera Genomics [[Private sector|private-sector]] project, DNA from five different individuals were used for sequencing.  The lead scientist of Celera Genomics at that time, Craig Venter, later acknowledged (in a public letter to the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'') that his DNA was one of 21 samples in the pool, five of which were selected for use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science|date=2002|volume=297|page=1237|title=Not wicked, perhaps, but tacky|author=Kennedy D|pmid=12193755|doi=10.1126/science.297.5585.1237|issue=5585}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science|date=2003|volume=299|pages=1183–4|title=A Part of the Human Genome Sequence|author=Venter D|pmid=12595674|doi=10.1126/science.299.5610.1183|issue=5610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a team led by [[Jonathan Rothberg]] published [[James Watson]]'s entire genome, unveiling the six-billion-nucleotide genome of a single individual for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = James Watson's genome sequenced at high speed|url = http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080416/full/452788b.html|journal = Nature News|date = 2008-04-16|pages = 788|volume = 452|issue = 7189|doi = 10.1038/452788b|pmid = 18431822|first = Meredith|last = Wadman|bibcode = 2008Natur.452R....W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developments ==
The work on interpretation and analysis of genome data is still in its initial stages. It is anticipated that detailed knowledge of the human genome will provide new avenues for advances in [[medicine]] and [[biotechnology]]. Clear practical results of the project emerged even before the work was finished. For example, a number of companies, such as [[Myriad Genetics]], started offering easy ways to administer genetic tests that can show predisposition to a variety of illnesses, including [[breast cancer]], [[blood clotting|hemostasis disorders]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[liver]] diseases and many others. Also, the [[etiology (medicine)|etiologies]] for [[cancer]]s, [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other areas of clinical interest are considered likely to benefit from genome information and possibly may lead in the long term to significant advances in their management.&lt;ref name=naid/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Gonzaga-Jauregui C|author2 = Lupski JR|author3 = Gibbs RA|title=Human genome sequencing in health and disease | journal= Annu Rev Med|volume= 63|issue=1 |pages=35–61 | date=2012 |pmid= 22248320|doi=10.1146/annurev-med-051010-162644 |pmc=3656720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also many tangible benefits for biologists. For example, a researcher investigating a certain form of [[cancer]] may have narrowed down their search to a particular gene. By visiting the human genome database on the [[World Wide Web]], this researcher can examine what other scientists have written about this gene, including (potentially) the three-dimensional structure of its product, its function(s), its evolutionary relationships to other human genes, or to genes in mice or yeast or fruit flies, possible detrimental mutations, interactions with other genes, body tissues in which this gene is activated, and diseases associated with this gene or other datatypes. Further, deeper understanding of the disease processes at the level of molecular biology may determine new therapeutic procedures. Given the established importance of DNA in molecular biology and its central role in determining the fundamental operation of [[Biological process|cellular processes]], it is likely that expanded knowledge in this area will facilitate medical advances in numerous areas of clinical interest that may not have been possible without them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Snyder M, Du J|author2 =Gerstein M |title=Personal genome sequencing: current approaches and challenges | journal=Genes Dev |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=423–431 | date=2012 |pmid=20194435 |doi=10.1101/gad.1864110 |pmc=2827837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of similarities between DNA sequences from different organisms is also opening new avenues in the study of [[evolution]]. In many cases, evolutionary questions can now be framed in terms of [[molecular biology]]; indeed, many major evolutionary milestones (the emergence of the [[ribosome]] and [[organelle]]s, the development of [[embryo]]s with body plans, the [[vertebrate]] [[immune system]]) can be related to the molecular level. Many questions about the similarities and differences between humans and our closest relatives (the [[primate]]s, and indeed the other [[mammal]]s) are expected to be illuminated by the data in this project.&lt;ref name=naid/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Lander ES |title= Initial impact of the sequencing of the human genome| journal=Nature |volume= 470|issue= 7333|pages=187–197 | date=2011 |pmid=21307931 |doi=10.1038/nature09792|bibcode = 2011Natur.470..187L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project inspired and paved the way for genomic work in other fields, such as agriculture. For example, by studying the genetic composition of Tritium aestivum, the world’s most commonly used bread wheat, great insight has been gained into the ways that domestication has impacted the evolution of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peng|first1=J|last2=Sun|first2=E|last3=Nevo|first3=D|title=Domestication Evolution, Genetics And Genomics In Wheat|journal=Molecular Breeding|date=2011|volume=28|issue=3|pages=281–301|doi=10.1007/s11032-011-9608-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Which loci are most susceptible to manipulation, and how does this play out in evolutionary terms? Genetic sequencing has allowed these questions to be addressed for the first time, as specific loci can be compared in wild and domesticated strains of the plant. This will allow for advances in genetic modification in the future which could yield healthier, more disease-resistant wheat crops.

== Ethical, legal and social issues ==
At the onset of the Human Genome Project several ethical, legal, and social concerns were raised in regards to how increased knowledge of the human genome could be used to discriminate against people.  One of the main concerns of most individuals was the fear that both employers and health insurance companies would refuse to hire individuals or refuse to provide insurance to people because of a health concern indicated by someone's genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greely|first=Henry|title=The Code of Codes: Scientific and Social Issues in the Human Genome Project|date=1992|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-674-13646-5|pages=264–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1996 the United States passed the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) which protects against the unauthorized and non-consensual release of individually identifiable health information to any entity not actively engaged in the provision of healthcare services to a patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = US Department of Health and Human Services|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/index.html|title=Understanding Health Information Privacy|date=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with identifying all of the approximately 20,000–25,000 genes in the human genome, the Human Genome Project also sought to address the ethical, legal, and social issues that were created by the onset of the project. For that the Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI) program was founded in 1990. Five percent of the annual budget was allocated to address the ELSI arising from the project.&lt;ref name=human/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Genetics Home Reference|url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/hgp/elsi |title= What were some of the ethical, legal, and social implications addressed by the Human Genome Project?| work=ghr.nlm.nih.gov |date=2013|accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This budget started at approximately $1.57 million in the year 1990, but increased to approximately $18 million in the year 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/10002329/elsi-research-program-fact-sheet/|title=ELSI Research Program Fact Sheet - National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)|website=www.genome.gov|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the project may offer significant benefits to medicine and scientific research, some authors have emphasized the need to address the potential social consequences of mapping the human genome. "Molecularising disease and their possible cure will have a profound impact on what patients expect from medical help and the new generation of doctors' perception of illness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rheinberger|first=H.J.|title=Living and Working with the New Medical Technologies|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United States|U.S.]] business and financial [[accounting]], the '''income''' is generally defined by [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States)|GAAP]] and the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] as: 
Revenues - Expenses; however, many people use it as shorthand for [[Net income|''net'' income]], which is the amount of money that a company earns after covering all of its costs as well as taxes.  

Net income is also called net profit.  It is calculated as follows:

# The gross income or revenue is tabulated.
# Where applicable, the cost of goods sold or cost of operations figure is subtracted from the gross income to yield the gross profit.
# All expenses other than the COGS or COO are subsequently subtracted from the gross profit to yield the profit or income - or, if a negative number, the net loss (usually written in parentheses).  More commonly, this is reported on the Income Statement as "Income (or Loss) Before Taxes."
# Taxes are then subtracted from the pre-tax income to give a final net income or net profit (or net loss) figure.
# The patented Blatt double check{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} is then factored in.

Net income or net profit which is not expended to shareholders in the form of [[dividend]]s becomes part of [[retained earnings]].

All [[public company|public companies]] are required to provide [[financial statements]] on a quarterly basis, and the income statement of income is one of the most important of these.  Some companies also provide a more rosy financial report of their income, with ''[[pro forma]]'' reporting, or, [[EBITDA]] reporting.  ''Pro forma'' income is an estimate of how much the company would have earned without including the negative effect of exceptional "one-time events", supposedly in order to show investors how much money the company would have made under normal circumstances if these exceptional, one-time events had not occurred.  Critics charge that, in most cases, the "one-time events" are normal business events, such as an acquisition of another company or a [[write off]] of a cancelled project or division, and that ''pro forma'' reporting is an attempt to mislead investors by painting a rosy financial picture. Besides that, when discussing results with analysts and shareholders, CEOs and CFOs have a tendency to do even more "hypothetical accounting".  [[EBITDA]] stands for "earnings before [[interest]], [[taxes]], [[depreciation]], and [[amortisation]]", and is also criticised for being an attempt to mislead investors.  [[Warren Buffett]] has criticised EBITDA reporting, famously asking, "Does management think the [[tooth fairy]] pays for [[capital expenditures]]?" {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

It is common for some other companies, such as [[real estate investment trust]]s, to present reports using a standard called FFO, or "Funds From Operations".  Like EBITDA reporting, FFO ignores depreciation and amortization.  This is widely accepted in the industry, as [[real estate]] values tend to increase rather than decrease over time, and many data sites report [[earnings per share]] data using FFO.

'''Isaac Benayon Sabba''' (Arabic: إسحاق بن آيون صباغ ; Portuguese: Isaac Benayon Sabbá; Hebrew: יצחק בניון שבח; February 12, 1907 – March 22, 1996) was a [[Brazil]]ian&lt;ref name=amazoniajudaica&gt;{{cite web|title=Isaac Benayon Sabbá|url=http://www.amazoniajudaica.org/167563/Isaac-Benayon-Sabb%C3%A1|website=http://www.amazoniajudaica.org|publisher=Amazônia Judaica|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; entrepreneur, founder of the [[IB Sabbá Ltda.]] group and [[Petroleo Sabbá S.A.]],&lt;ref name=amazoniajudaica /&gt; the largest business group operating on the Brazilian [[Brazilian Amazon|Amazon]] region during the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=amazoniajudaica /&gt;

==Background==

Isaac Sabbá was born into a [[Jews|Jewish]] family of [[Moroccan Jews|Moroccan]] origin, he was the third son among five children of Primo Sabbá and Fortunata (née.Benayon) Sabbá. His father was son of Moroccan immigrants born in [[Cametá]] when it was the capital of the state of [[State of Grão-Pará and Maranhão|Grão-Pará]]. His mother was born in [[Faro, Portugal]] her parents were both Jewish immigrants from [[Morocco]].

=== Early life ===

His family moved [[Manaus]] for his older sister wedding, because his future brother in law had offered employment, he was 12. Soon began working as an office assistant representation of his brother in law. The workload did not allow him to study, interrupting their school life in the [[second grade]].However, he reserved his spare time for reading, a habit that he cultivated all his life.&lt;ref name=fdb&gt;{{cite web|title=Fundação Amazônica de defesa da Biosfera|url=http://www.fdb.org.br/?pg=galeria,personalidades&amp;cd=2|website=http://www.fdb.org.br/|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Sabbá founded the firm IB Sabbá, an exporting firm and later changing the name to IB Sabbá &amp; Cia. Ltda. his most successful company was the Petróleo Sabbá, the company had the participation of his nephew Moyses Israel.

The group had diversified its business portfolio created over 42 factories, as FiteJuta (beneficiation [[Jute]]), [[alligator]] leather benefiting Co., [[oil refinery]] and distribution of petrol .They exported [[rosewood]], [[Brazil nut]], [[Oil refinery]] among other products of the extractive industry.

===Early career===
In 1930 he joined in partnership with one of his brothers, and founded the firm J.Sabbá representations &amp; Cia. He soon realized the limited potential of this line of business, and moved to an export firm. Began, then a sort of interstate commerce while exporting firms of Amazonas then existing employed its activities almost exclusively in foreign trade.&lt;ref name=fdb /&gt;

====World War II====
With the outbreak of World War II, the Federal Government established the monopoly of rubber, a time when Isaac Sabbá company accounted for 64% of export of the Amazon. This would not be the only time that the government would nationalize his companies.&lt;ref name=eretzamazonia&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benchimol|first1=Samuel|title=Eretz Amazonia|publisher=Valer|isbn=9788586512216|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, Isaac Sabbá had founded the Companhia Mercantil Comissionária e Exportadora, transformed later in Devel - Amazon Development Society Ltda., in order to increase the elastic-tire businesses.&lt;ref name=amazoniajudaica /&gt;

That company was equipped vessels that sailed all state rivers in search of latex. Also created during the war, the company Jacy Paraná, in the current state of Rondônia, aiming to increase rubber production.&lt;ref name=amazoniajudaica /&gt;

====After World War II====
With the rapid increase in consumption of chewing gum after World War II, he set up a raw materials dehydration plant, with the aim of ensuring the placement of the Amazon product in the international market. He did the same with Brazilian nuts.&lt;ref name=amazoniajudaica /&gt;

===Business Expansion===
[[File:Isaac Benayon Sabbá and Presidente JK.jpg|thumbnail|200px|left|Isaac Sabbá and Brazilian President Juscelino Juscelino Kubitschek]]
Understanding the weaknesses of the Amazonian business environment, characterized by poverty and lack of financial resources that could be used for the exploitation of its immense natural wealth, he studied and put in action a funding system that benefited the producer. After analysing the situation of the local industries, he saw that it was not possible to increase the production of raw materials without a fuel supply, at an affordable price on the Amazon region. Hence came the idea of building an oil refinery in Manaus which became Reman.&lt;ref name=amazoniajudaica /&gt;

He was called by the [[Time Magazine]] and the [[Los Angeles Times]] as "The King of the Amazon".&lt;ref name=king&gt;{{cite web|title=King of The Amazon|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&amp;dat=19720319&amp;id=ywMdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LZwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7406,3607620&amp;hl=pt-BR|website=google newspaper|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oil Business====
The Oil Refinery Isaac Sabbá, built on the shores of the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] in Manaus, began operations on September 6, 1956 under the name Companhia de Petroleo do Amazonas(Copam - Petroleum Company of the Amazon). The refinery was officially opened on January 3, 1957, with the presence of President [[Juscelino Kubitschek]].&lt;ref name=petrobras&gt;{{cite web|title=Reman- Isaac Sabbá|url=http://www.petrobras.com.br/pt/nossas-atividades/principais-operacoes/refinarias/refinaria-isaac-sabba-reman.htm|website=http://www.petrobras.com.br/|publisher=Petrobras|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, only to produce fuel was not enough, most important was to make them accessible to other consumer centers, his aim was the integration of the Amazon region in the economic life of the country.&lt;ref name=amazoniajudaica /&gt;

In 1971 IB Sabbá partnered with [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and formed the society Petróleo Sabbá SA, which took over the activities of the Petroleum department of IB Sabbá &amp; Cia. Ltda. In the same year COPAM was nationalized by the military government,&lt;ref name=enfoque&gt;{{cite news|title=Isaac Sabba, ícone do empreendedorismo|url=http://www.enfoqueamazonico.com.br/notas.php?dot=9|accessdate=10 November 2015|agency=http://www.enfoqueamazonico.com.br/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was renamed Refinaria de Manaus(REMAN) which means Manaus Refinery, only in 1996 after his death it was renamed Refinaria Isaac Sabbá.&lt;ref name=petrobras /&gt; On May 31, 1974, Copam it was incorporated into the Petrobras System as Manaus Refinery (Reman).

A [[soccer team]] was named after a Petroleo Sabbá [[gas station]] the [[Associação Atlética Cori-Sabbá]].

==Death==
Isaac Sabbá died on March 26, 1996 of pneumonia. He was survived by his wife Irene and his four children, seven grandchildren and three great grandchildren.

==Philanthropy==
Sabbá built the Military Hospital of Manaus the federal funding for the construction of the hospital would be returned, the hospital that still serves up to its objectives.&lt;ref name=amazoniajudaica /&gt;

When the CEM - Manaus Electricity Company - was implemented in the city it had Isaac Sabbá as a guarantor. He also surveyed the necessary resources with banks in order to pay the payroll of the employees. In order to help, he putted the equipment and machinery of his refinery at the disposal of the new company, without charge.&lt;ref name=amazoniajudaica /&gt;

Isaac Sabbá also helped create and was the one who helped the BEA - Amazonas state bank - in the most difficult moments, lending you money whenever the cash needs of the isntituição required.&lt;ref name=amazoniajudaica /&gt;

As a Jew throughout his life, he was a member of the Amazonas Jewish Committee, and he raised money to build Manaus synagogue Beit Yaacob - Rebi Meyr.

==Personal life==
Sabbá married Irene (née. Assayag) Gonçalves Sabbá in 1942. The couple had 5 children, Moises Gonçalves Sabbá (b.1944), Alberto Mimon Gonçalves Sabbá (b. 1945), Mario Gonçalves Sabbá (b.1947), Ester Gonçalves Sabbá (b.1949) and Débora Gonçalves Sabbá (1963-1963). He took as a pupil his nephew Moyses Benarrós Israel, who was his right hand during all of his life.&lt;ref name=amazoniajudaica /&gt;

== Career ==
In 1999, Komeil Bahmanpour was introduced to an [[United States|American]] eforms software company willing to open overseas subsidiaries for the purpose of [[Middle East]]ern software development and marketing. The deal went on and Chortkeh ({{lang-fa|چرتکه}})—back then doing business as ''Chortkeh Rayaneh Hamrah, LLC'' ({{lang-fa|چرتکه رایانه همراه، شرکت با مسئولیت محدود}})—was established.&lt;ref name="NewsInterview" /&gt;

=== Chortkeh ===
He was assigned as the chief [[software architecture|software architect]] also managing development teams working on projects in different fields such as [[Document conversion|eforms conversion]], [[virtual printer]], [[object recognition]], [[barcode]], etc.

=== Persian Open Directory Project ===
Since 2003, Komeil Bahmanpour has been the managing editor of [[Netscape]]'s [[Persian language|Persian]] [[Open Directory Project|ODP]],&lt;ref name="DmozProfile"&gt;{{cite web
| title = Profile - komeil
| publisher = [[Open Directory Project]]
| url = http://www.dmoz.org/public/profile?editor=komeil
| accessdate = August 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; still maintaining its Persian [[Web portal|portal]] at [http://www.dmoz.ir/ Dmoz.ir].&lt;ref name="DmozIr"&gt;{{cite web
| title = Persian Open Directory Project
| publisher = Chortkeh
| language = Persian
| url = http://www.dmoz.ir/
| accessdate = August 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He won the Best World/Farsi Editor at the 2004 ODP Autumn Editor Awards.&lt;ref name="MozzieAward"&gt;{{cite web

| format = GIF
| accessdate = August 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Persian ODP managing editor, Bahmanpour was behind a big decision to change the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] of the Persian ODP from [http://www.dmoz.org/World/Farsi/ Dmoz.org/World/Farsi/] into [http://www.dmoz.org/World/Persian/ Dmoz.org/World/Persian/].&lt;ref name="GoogleUpdateDelay"&gt;{{cite web

Eventually, in March 2007 the URL was changed.&lt;ref name="DmozUrl"&gt;{{cite web

'''Lugcentrokuz''' ({{lang-uk|Лугцентрокуз}}) is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] rail transport industrial company headquartered in [[Luhansk]]. It was established as an independent company, separate from the press [[forging]] department of [[Luhanskteplovoz]] in 1991.

== History ==
[[File:Luhcentrokuz plaque 1930 1932.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Plaque stating the construction dates.]]

Lugcentrokuz is one of the various companies founded from the existing steam locomotive factory in [[Luhansk]] that was built by the German entrepreneur [[Gustav Hartmann]]. A [[steam forge]] was one of its first departments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contact-teplovoz.lugansk.ua/history.html History of Luhanskteplovoz] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Ukrainian War of Independence]], up until 1991, Lugcentrokuz was a part of this factory and was best known as the [[Luhanskteplovoz|October Revolution Locomotive Factory]] (after the October Revolution).

An extensive rebuild of the Luhansk factory was undertaken during 1928–1933 by the construction board, [[Luhanbud]], during which the present company's central premises were reconstructed.

During the 1970s, the Luhansk [[locomotive]] factory produced up to 1500 locomotive units a year, 96% of which were main-line diesels.

The majority of Lugcentrokuz's exports went to Eastern Germany, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria,Egypt, Syria, India, Iran, Mongolia, North Korea and Cuba. Altogether, a total of 4000 main-line diesel locomotives were exported to countries outside of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://1210.ua.all.biz/info-history History of Luhanskteplovoz] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Present Day ==
After regaining [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|Ukrainian Independence]] in 1991, a separate company under the name of "Luhansk Central Forging Factory" was founded, based on the press [[forging]] department. In 1992, it gained its current name.

During the next several years, several new manufacturing techniques were introduced, which included [[Electric arc furnace|electric arc steel furnacing]], [[Die (manufacturing)|die manufacturing]], mechanical assembling, [[leaf spring|leaf spring manufacturing]] and a testing center.

As of 2013, the export countries are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lck.com.ua/uk/partnyory.html |script-title=uk:Партнёры &amp;#124; Куем. Словом и делом |language=uk |publisher=Lck.com.ua |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the stepfather of a businessman, Mirco Martins.

==Political career==
In 1999, Vicente was appointed as head of Sonangol.&lt;ref name=Homme/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oilman/&gt; In that key post, he presided over the most important sector of the Angolan economy and was considered a close associate of President [[José Eduardo dos Santos]].&lt;ref name=Homme/&gt; During his time in charge of the company, oil production increased dramatically.&lt;ref name=Oilman/&gt; He routinely traveled abroad, acquiring "an excellent reputation from the international business community".&lt;ref name=Ex/&gt; Vicente was appointed as a member of the Political Bureau of the [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA), the ruling party, in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africaintelligence.com/AEM/who-s-who/2010/01/06/manuel-vicente,77688837-ART "Manuel Vicente"], ''Africa Energy Intelligence'', number 619, Africa Intelligence, 6 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A September 2011 report in ''Novo Jornal'' claimed that dos Santos intended for Vicente to be his successor.&lt;ref name=Oilman/&gt; The report was followed by a flurry of speculation.&lt;ref name=Oilman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africa-confidential.com/article-preview/id/4148/Vicente_to_succeed_Dos_Santos "Vicente to succeed Dos Santos?"], ''Africa Confidential'', volume 52, number 18, 9 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Vicente was, however, reappointed for another term at the head of Sonangol in December 2011, briefly tempering the speculation.&lt;ref name=Oilman/&gt;

President dos Santos appointed Vicente as Minister of State for Economic Coordination on 30 January 2012;&lt;ref name=Homme/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oilman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/pt_pt/noticias/politica/2012/0/5/Presidente-Republica-nomeia-ministro-Estado-Coordenacao-Economica,c6a801f0-14b9-4791-90b4-8007f8274c9d.html "Presidente da República nomeia ministro de Estado da Coordenação Económica"], Angola Press Agency, 30 January 2012 {{pt icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francisco de Lemos José Maria]] succeeded Vicente at Sonangol.&lt;ref name=Homme/&gt; In line with earlier speculation, the move was generally interpreted by observers as suggesting that dos Santos was positioning Vicente as his eventual successor.&lt;ref name=Homme/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oilman/&gt; It appeared that Vicente's government post would give him a great deal of authority in managing the economy, and it would bolster Vicente's credibility and experience given that he had previously only been involved in the oil industry.&lt;ref name=Oilman/&gt; Nevertheless, it was believed that some other leading figures in the ruling party were skeptical about Vicente, given his relative inexperience in politics, and could be trying to resist the President's efforts to position him for the succession.&lt;ref name=Homme/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oilman/&gt;

[[Agence France-Presse]] reported in February 2012, citing an MPLA source, that Vicente would have the second spot on the MPLA's candidate list for the 2012 election, behind dos Santos, and would become [[Vice-President of Angola]] after the election.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gMM8fcD-SoSYfkYZ4BpqqKOfaydQ?docId=CNG.298ed147731872d4e6278091cab9c895.921 "Angola's Dos Santos to seek new term: party source"], Agence France-Presse, 11 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As anticipated, the MPLA Central Committee designated President dos Santos as head of the MPLA party list and Vicente as the second candidate on the list on 13 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/en_us/noticias/politica/2012/5/24/President-Eduardo-dos-Santos-leads-party-list,b7b248c1-41a9-4c17-b7f2-883b9f8c3ed6.html "President Eduardo dos Santos leads party's list"], Angola Press Agency, 13 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The MPLA won the election, and Vicente took office as Vice President on 26 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/en_us/noticias/politica/2012/8/39/Manuel-Vicente-inaugurated-Vice-president-Republic,6eeef65d-2009-485c-a9c1-52e4c7eb619e.html "Manuel Vicente inaugurated as Vice-president of Republic"], Angola Press Agency, 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014 Manuel Vicente participated, representing the Angolan Head of State, in the [[United States–Africa Leaders Summit]], an initiative of the American president, [[Barack Obama]], held in Washington DC under the theme "Investing in the future of Africa."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portalangop.co.ao/angola/en_us/noticias/politica/2014/7/31/Vice-President-attends-Africa-summit,91a709b3-4da4-4b55-bd75-3e4897100913.html Vice President attends US/Africa summit], Angolan Press Agency, August 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuel Vicente was present at the 69th [[General Assembly of the United Nations]], which took place in September 2014 in [[New York City]]. The Angolan Vice-President defended a reform in the [[UN Security Council]], which, according to him, should “be more in line with the international context and reflect an equal geographical representation through the increase in the number of permanent members”, namely by including an African country. In his speech, the Angolan Vice-President also approached issues such as the resurgence of armed conflicts and the religious fundamentalism in some African countries, as well as the importance of disarmament and the combating of drug and human trafficking and transnational organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observador.pt/2014/09/29/angola-quer-africa-em-permanencia-conselho-de-seguranca/ Angola quer África em permanência no Conselho de Segurança] Observador (29-09-2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, Manuel Vicente was distinguished with the "Sirius Award" by the multinational corporation [[Deloitte]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portalangop.co.ao/angola/en_us/noticias/politica/2014/10/48/Vice-president-gets-Sirius-Award,9b143885-bc73-4e5c-a4e7-0dd995bb0be5.html Vice President gets Sirius Award] Angola Press Agency, November 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, the MPLA chose [[João Lourenço]], the Minister of Defense and Vice-President of the MPLA, as the party's top candidate and therefore its presidential candidate for the [[Angolan legislative election, 2017|2017 election]]. Lourenço, and not Vicente, was thus expected to succeed dos Santos as President.&lt;ref&gt;Herculano Coroado, [https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN13S06T?sp=true "Angola's Dos Santos not up for re-election in 2017 -party document"], Reuters, 3 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In June 2017, a Portuguese court ruled that Vincente should face trial over bribery allegations brought against him by a prosecutor in February 2017 after accused of bribing a magistrate with $810,000 in order to shelve investigations into his deals at an oil company named [[Sonangol Group]] which he headed between 2009 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanews.com/2017/06/22/angolan-vice-president-must-face-portuguese-corruption-charges-court-rules/|title=Angolan Vice President should face Portuguese corruption charges: court rules|publisher=Africanews|date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Hayek started his career with [[France Telecom]] in Lebanon – Cellis, known currently as Alfa, where he was part of the initial team that built the first GSM network in Lebanon, before joining later on the [[Orascom Telecom Holding]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="BusinessYear2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thebusinessyear.com/lebanon-2012/wired-up/vip-interview |title=Wired Up |date=July 2012 |work=The Business year |publisher=TBY |access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek has held several assignments within the Orascom Telecom Group’s subsidiaries and its Holding, the latest before his current appointment was in September 2007, where he joined [[Mobinil]] - Egypt as VP Technology in charge of both network and IT infrastructure.

Hayek took the helm of [[Alfa (Lebanon)|Alfa]], the first Lebanese mobile operator managed by [[Orascom Telecom]], as its chairman and CEO, since the beginning of March 2010.&lt;ref name="ArabCom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arabcommunications.com/dialDetails.asp?id=1&amp;catid=35|title=Interview with Marwan Hayek - CEO and Chairman of ALFA |date=8 August 2011 |work=Arab Communication Consult |publisher=ACC |access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TelcoReview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telecomreviewna.com/index.php/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=315:telecom-review-summit-draws-world-telecom-leaders&amp;catid=45:january-2013&amp;Itemid=90 |title=Telecom Review Summit Draws World Telecom Leaders |date=15 January 2013 |work=Telecom Review |publisher=Trace Media |access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He led the introduction of the 3G+&lt;ref name="DailyStar2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Business/Lebanon/2011/Oct-26/152215-alfa-launches-long-awaited-3g-services-for-mobile-phone-clients.ashx |title=Alfa Launches Long-Awaited 3G Services |date=26 October 2011 |work=The Daily Star |publisher=Daily Star |access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; technology that was first launched in October 2011&lt;ref name="Marcopolis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marcopolis.net/alfa-lebanon-on-telecom-sector-3g-and-regulations.htm |title=Alfa Lebanon on Lebanese Telecom Sector, 3G and Regulations |date=24 September 2012 |work=Marcopolis |publisher=Marcopolis, LLC |access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the introduction of 4G-LTE technology in May 2013. The Lebanese internet cable networks do not currently support fibre optics and the introduction of 3G+ followed by 4G-LTE gave access to the Lebanese people to high-speed internet.&lt;ref name="MediaME"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediame.com/en/news/digital_media/lebanese_telecom_sector_supports_rapid_growth_digital_market |title=Lebanese Telecom Sector Supports The Rapid Growth Of The Digital Market |date=17 March 2013 |work=Arab Net |publisher=Media ME |access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political Controversy ==

In 2015 there was a controversy where the Governmental Tender Office claimed that Hayek did not submit the tender for the renewal of Alfa's governmental regulated contract on time and the Prime Minister's office disqualified Orascom from taking part in the bidding. The [[Shura Council]] cancelled the decision and ordered the Tender Office to endorse the company’s application. The council also urged it to conduct a public and equally competitive bid.&lt;ref name="Daily Star"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Business/Local/2015/Oct-07/318026-decision-banning-alfa-operator-from-telecom-tenders-annulled.ashx |title=Decision Banning Alfa Operator From Telecom Tenders Annulled |date=7 October 2015 |work=The Daily Star |publisher=The Daily Star |access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BusinessNews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessnews.com.lb/cms/Story/StoryDetails.aspx?ItemID=5167 |title=Alfa’s Orascom To Rejoin Telecom Tender |date=8 October 2015 |work=Business News |publisher=InfoPro sal. |access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mercurio J. Martinez, Jr.''', often known as '''Merc Martinez''' (born July 25, 1937), is an educator, [[ranch]]er, and [[business]]man from his native [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]], [[Texas]]. From 1991 to 2002, he was the [[County Judge]] of [[Webb County, Texas|Webb County]] in [[South Texas]].

==Background==

Martinez was one of two children born at the age of sixty-three to Mercurio Martinez, Sr. (1876-1965), and his third wife, the 42-year-old former Cristina Treviño. The senior Martinez was a descendant of [[Spain|Spanish]]-[[Mexico|Mexican]] pioneers who had settled on the banks of the [[Rio Grande River]] in the mid-eighteenth century. An educator and public official in his native [[Zapata County, Texas|Zapata County]], Martinez subsequently practiced law in Laredo until 1942, when he retired at the age of sixty-six. He continued to associate with other lawyers on occasional cases dealing with land ownership and engaged in historical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/tamucush/00083/tamu-00083.html|title=Inventory of the Mercurio Martinez Papers|publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University]]|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The younger sister of Martinez, Jr., is named Rosa, which is also the name of his wife, the former Rosa Ancira, whom he married in 1959. Mercurio and Rosa Martinez have six children, Leticia, Adriana, Mercurio, III, Jorge, Carlos, and Rosalycia.&lt;ref name=lisd/&gt;

Martinez, Jr., was reared in the downtown La Azteca neighborhood of Laredo and graduated from [[Saint Augustine High School (Laredo, Texas)|St. Augustine High School]], then located downtown in the [[San Agustin de Laredo Historic District]] adjacent to the [[Cathedral of San Agustin (Laredo, Texas)|Cathedral of San Agustin]]. He studied at [[Laredo Community College|Laredo Junior College]], renamed in 1993 as [[Laredo Community College]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He was exempt from [[conscription]] in the 1960s because he was a married father.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/voces/template-stories-indiv.html?work_urn=urn%3Autlol%3Awwlatin.717&amp;work_title=Martinez%2C+Mercurio|title=Vidushi Shrimali, "Mercurio Martinez, Jr."|publisher=lib.utexas.edu|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1968 to 1978, Martinez was trustee of LJC and its parent organization, the [[Laredo Independent School District]].&lt;ref name=tamiudocument/&gt; This was an era where the "Patron Party" ruled all local governmental entities providing political favors in return for loyalty and votes.&lt;ref name="Patron Democracy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Piñon|first1=Fernando|title=Patron Democracy|date=1985|publisher=Contraste}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has served since 2004 on the elected LCC board. He received his [[Bachelor of Business Administration]] in 1959 from [[St. Mary's University, Texas|St. Mary's University]] in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]]. He procured a [[Master of Business Administration]] degree from the [[University of North Texas]] in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]]. He did post-graduate study at [[Southern Methodist University]] near [[Dallas]], [[Colorado State University]] in [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]], and the [[Harvard University School of Business]].&lt;ref name=lisd/&gt;

Martinez was an LJC business and economics instructor from c. 1960 until 1967, when he joined Union National Bank of Laredo, since [[Wells Fargo]] near City Hall.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;"2014 honoree: Mercurio Martinez, Jr.: Former councilman, county judge to receive higher education award for community work," ''[[Laredo Morning Times]]'', February 6, 2014, p. 4D.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political life==

In 1978, Martinez was elected to the Laredo City Council, a nominally [[nonpartisan]] position. At the same time, [[Aldo Tatangelo]] was elected [[mayor]] to succeed the retiring [[J. C. Martin (Texas politician)|J. C. "Pepe" Martin]] of the former "Independent Club" or "Patron Party", who subsequently spent time in the Webb County Jail for theft of municipal services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/wmiqt|title=Independent Club|publisher=''[[The Handbook of Texas]]''|accessdate= April 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martinez worked on the council to change the city government from "strong mayor" to "weak mayor" format through a new municipal charter.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; After a brief time on the council, he was asked by [[U.S. President]] [[Jimmy Carter]], a fellow [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], to head the Southwest Regional Office in Dallas of the [[Small Business Administration]]. During this stint, he lived in Dallas on weekdays but returned to Laredo most weekends.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

In 1982, Martinez returned to Laredo to run for mayor against Tatangelo, and though he had led in the primary, he lost in the [[runoff election]].&lt;ref name=tamiudocument&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamiu.edu/oatah/rmendiola/documents/MercurioMartinezJr..pdf|title=Mercurio Martinez, Jr.|publisher=tamiu.edu|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martinez was "considered the best Old Party (Patron) candidate to reclaim the mayorship" in Fernando Piñon's book titled Patron Democracy.&lt;ref name="Patron Democracy"/&gt; In 1990, he was elected county judge, having unseated the incumbent Andres "Andy" Ramos. Though he had no [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opponent in the [[general election]], former Mayor Tatangelo, at the age of seventy-seven, opposed his former mayoral rival Martinez for county judge as a [[write-in]] candidate. Martinez still prevailed with some 75 percent of the votes cast, but the county Republican leadership, headed by [[Esther Buckley]], endorsed Tatangelo. After three terms as county judge, Martinez was unseated in the 2002 Democratic primary by [[Louis H. Bruni]], a former member of the Laredo City Council from District 2. Thereafter, beginning in the fall of 2003, Martinez began teaching accounting at [[Texas A&amp;M International University]] in Laredo.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis H. Bruni served only one term as county judge, having been defeated in 2006 by [[Danny Valdez]], who was himself defeated after two terms by former professional [[baseball]] player [[Tano Tijerina]] in 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Martinez ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination to represent Texas House District 42, having  been defeated by the incumbent and still serving [[Richard Raymond (Texas politician)|Richard Raymond]] of Laredo. In the primary Raymond fell .07 percent plus one vote short of an outright victory. He finished first with 11,806 votes (49.8 percent); Martinez trailed with 7,650 (32.3 percent). Two other contenders held the remaining 17.9 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe |title=2006 Democratic Party Primary Election: 3/7/2006 |publisher=elections.sos.state.tx.us |accessdate=April 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109062336/http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe |archivedate=January 9, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the runoff in April 2006, Raymond prevailed, 8,828 votes (57.8 percent) to 6,456 (42.2 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe |title=Democratic Party Primary Runoff Election Results |date=April 11, 2006 |publisher=Texas Secretary of State |accessdate=April 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109062336/http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe |archivedate=January 9, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oddly, in 2005, Martinez  contributed $1,000 to Raymond's proposed run for the [[United States House of Representatives]], a race that never materialized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/elec2/06/elec-LAREDO-TX-06.html|title=LAREDO, Texas (TX) Political Contributions by Individuals|publisher=city-data.com|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Martinez ran for reelection for the Laredo Community College board of trustees and was challenged by educator, author, and political activist Justin Allen Hundsnurscher.  He won reelection with 61.89% of the vote or 28,723 votes against Hundsnurscher's 17,687 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.laredo.edu/cms/LCC/News_and_Events/News/ImageRotation/content/2016/Nov/Election_results/ |title=LCC Board of Trustees 2016 Election Results }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the still staunchly Democratic Martinez emerged as one of the first persons in Webb County to endorse [[Beto O'Rourke]], the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. representative]] for [[Texas' 16th congressional district]], who expects to challenge Republican [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Ted Cruz]] in the general election scheduled for [[United States Senate election in Texas, 2018|November 6, 2018]]. Martinez claimed that Cruz has "alienated the majority of the senators ... We cannot afford somebody that has alienated the Senate that way. I've always felt that politics is the act of compromise. Let's reach a middle ground. In my opinion, Beto O'Rourke has that ability."  Martinez said at a campaign stop that he sees no reason why O'Rourke won't match [[John F. Kennedy]]'s 90 percent margin in Webb County in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1960|1960 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lmtonline.com/local/politics/article/U-S-congressman-Beto-O-Rourke-returns-to-11723174.php|author=Julia Wallace|title=U.S. Congressman Beto O’Rourke returns to Laredo, hits up Palenque Grill|publisher=''Laredo Morning Times''|date=August 1, 2017|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==

In 2014, Martinez was honored with the "Higher Education Award" by the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]], formally presented as part of the [[Washington's Birthday Celebration]] in Laredo.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He is a past recipient of the [[Paul P. Harris|Paul Harris]] Award from [[Rotary International]], the St. George and Silver Beaver medals from the [[Boy Scouts of America]], the Tejano Achiever Award from LULAC, and "Distinguished Alumni" in 2001 of Laredo Community College.&lt;ref name=lisd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laredoisd.org/departments/tds/cabm.html|title=Mercurio Martinez|publisher=[[Laredo Independent School District]]|accessdate=April 28, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140129202511/http://www.laredoisd.org/departments/tds/cabm.html|archivedate=January 29, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martinez's namesake grandson, Mercurio Martinez, IV, was killed in an automobile accident in 2009 at the age of eighteen. Each year the community honors his memory with the "Mercurio Martinez, IV
Teens in the Driver Seat, Annual 5K Run", sponsored by the [[Vidal M. Trevino School of Communications and Fine Arts|Vidal M. Treviño School of Communications and Fine Arts]], an entity of the Laredo Independent School District named for the late educator and [[Texas House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Vidal M. Treviño]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laredoisd.org/board/nelsonsnotes/pics%20final/5k%20registration%20form%202013.pdf|title=Mercurio Martinez, IV Teens in the Driver Seat, 5th Annual 5K Run, Sunday March 24, 2013|publisher=laredoisd.org|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
As a child he was taught in a mosque and started working alternatively as a goat herder and farmer. At 15, he saved up enough money and moved from [[Marrakech]] to [[Kenitra]] where he started his first construction company in 1948.

At a time when trading business in Kenitra was restricted to the French, some Jewish businessmen, and some of the well known Moroccan families, Chaâbi ventured into the field. His interest went toward the ceramic industry which made him start his own ceramic company in 1964. 
Soon, Chaâbi gained enough experience in the business and began to seek for opportunities to purchase large companies. He offered to become an investor in a French company but the company refused his offer, which drove him to keep pressuring it by selling products with competitive prices until it had finally collapsed and was on the verge of bankruptcy. In 1985, the company sold all of its properties to Chaâbi himself. This success was a turning point for Chaâbi's professional career, and as a result he founded [[Ynna Group]] which became one of the most powerful holding companies in Morocco.

In 1992, he founded JBC for [[cardboard]] paper and got a deal for the sale of the petrochemical company [[Société nationale d'électrolyse et de pétrochimie|SNEP]] in 1993. In 1994, he launched ELECTRA for electrical components, cables and television batteries. In 1998, he launched Aswak Assalam shopping chain which was followed by the launch of Riyad Mogador hotel chain in 1999.

==Political career==
Until he resigned in 2014, Miloud Chaabi won all Moroccan parliamentary elections since 1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chambredesrepresentants.ma/ar/anciens-deputes/%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%84-%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B9%D8%A8%D9%8A-anciens-d%C3%A9put%C3%A9s|title=ميلود الشعبي|date=2014-10-10|work=مجلس النواب، البرلمان، المملكة المغربية|access-date=2017-09-12|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he changed his political party multiple times. Parties of which he was a member include [[Party of Progress and Socialism]] and [[Environment and Development Party]].
In July 2008, he heavily criticized Driss Jettou's government for selling public properties at low prices without taking the proper legal procedures.

[[File:Waitress taking an order.jpg|thumb|325px|A [[waitress]] writes down the food order of diners]]

In the [[United States]]  and (at least some) other English-speaking countries, a '''pink-collar- worker''' refers to someone working in the care-oriented career field or in jobs historically considered to be "women’s work."  This may include jobs in nursing, teaching, secretarial work, waitressing, or child care.&lt;ref name="statistic1"/&gt; While these jobs may be filled by men, they are typically female-dominated and may or may not pay significantly less than [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] or [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] jobs.&lt;ref name="statistic2"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The term "pink-collar" was popularized in the late 1970s by writer and social critic Louise Kapp Howe to denote women working as nurses, secretaries, and elementary school teachers. Its origins, however, go back to the early 1970s, to when the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) was placed before the states for ratification. At that time, the term was used to denote secretarial staff as well as non-professional office staff, all of which were largely held by women. These positions were not white-collar jobs, but neither were they blue-collar, manual labor. Hence, the creation of the term "pink-collar," which indicated it was not white-collar, was nonetheless an office job and one that was overwhelmingly filled by women.

== Occupations ==
Pink-collar occupations tend to be personal-service-oriented worker working in retail, nursing, and [[Teacher|teaching]] (depending on the level), are part of the [[service sector]], and are among the most common occupations in the [[United States]]. The [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] estimates that, as of May 2008, there were over 2.2 million persons employed as servers in the United States.&lt;ref name="statistic1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes353031.htm |title=Occupational Employment and Wages - Waiters and Waitresses |accessdate=2006-12-31 |author=U.S. Department of Labor - Bureau of Labor Statistics |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=24 May 2006 |work= |publisher=US Department of Labor }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the [[World Health Organization]]'s 2011 World Health Statistics Report states that there are 19.3 million nurses in the world today.&lt;ref name="statistic2"&gt;{{cite web|title=World Health Statistics 2011|url=http://www.who.int/whosis/whostat/2011/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, women comprise 92.1% of the registered nurses that are currently employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quick Facts on Registered Nurses|url=http://www.dol.gov/wb/factsheets/Qf-nursing.htm|publisher=US Department of Labor|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pink-collar occupations include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://money.usnews.com/money/careers/articles/2012/09/10/the-pink-collar-job-boom | title=The Pink-Collar Job Boom | publisher=US News | accessdate=13 June 2014 | author=David Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nbclatino.com/2012/06/27/nine-pink-collar-jobs-men-want-most/ | title=Nine pink collar jobs men want most | publisher=NBC | date=2012-06-27 | accessdate=29 June 2014 | author=Katerina Sardi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Historically, women were responsible for the running of a household.&lt;ref&gt;Ware 1982, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Their financial security was often dependent upon a male patriarch. Widowed or divorced women struggled to support themselves and their children.&lt;ref&gt;Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;

Women began to develop more opportunities when they moved into the paid workplace, formerly of the male domain. In the 20th century women aimed to be treated like the equals of their male counterparts. In 1920 American women won the [[suffrage|right to vote]], marking a turning point in their roles in life.&lt;ref&gt;Naffziger, Claudeen Cline; et al. (1974). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/582762 "Development of Sex Role Stereotypes"], ''The Family Coordinator'' '''256''' (3)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many single women traveled to cities like New York where they found work in factories and [[sweatshop]]s, working for low pay operating sewing machines, sorting feathers, rolling tobacco and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Gourley 2008, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

These factories were dirty, noisy, dark, and dangerous. Workers frequently breathed dangerous fumes and worked with flammable materials.&lt;ref name="humowitz239"&gt;Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Women lost fingers and hands in accidents because in order to save money they were required to clean and adjust the machines while they were running.&lt;ref name="humowitz239"/&gt; Unfortunately, most women who worked in the factories did not earn enough money to live on and lived in poverty.

Throughout the 20th century certain women helped change women's roles in America. [[Emily Balch]], [[Jane Addams]], and [[Lillian Wald]] are among the most notable.&lt;ref name="gourley99"&gt;Gourley 2008, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; They created settlement houses and launched missions in crowded, unsanitary neighborhoods where immigrants lived.&lt;ref name="gourley99"/&gt; Balch, Addams, and Wald offered social services to the women and children, often inviting them into their homes and classrooms.&lt;ref name="gourley99"/&gt;

Women took on leadership roles starting in the church. Women became involved with the church activities, a few went on to become president of the societies. The women who joined these societies worked with their members some of whom were full-time teachers, nurses, missionaries, and social workers to accomplish their leadership tasks and make a difference.&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;Wallace, Ruth A (2000). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1388082 "Women and Religion: The Transformation of Leadership Roles,"] ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'' '''502''' (4)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association for the Sociology of Religion]] was the first to elect a woman president in 1938.&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;

=== During World Wars I and II ===
[[File:U.S. Navy Nurse Corps recruiting poster, January 1945 (NH 78855).jpg|150px|thumb|left|A [[U.S. Navy]] recruiting poster from World War II, showing an officer of the [[Navy WAVES]] before a hospital ship]]

[[World War I]] was the beginning of "pink-collar jobs" as the military needed personnel to type letters, answer phones, and perform other tasks. One thousand women worked for the U.S. Navy as [[stenographer]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, clerks, and telephone operators.&lt;ref&gt;Gourley 2008, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of nursing also became [[Feminisation of the workplace|"feminized"]] and was an accepted profession for women. In 1917, [[Louisa Lee Schuyler]] opened the [[Bellevue Hospital School of Nursing]], the first to train women as professional nurses.&lt;ref&gt;Gourley 2008, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; After completing training, some female nurses worked in hospitals, but most worked in field tents.

[[World War II]] marked the first time women began working in high-paying industrial jobs. They worked in factories and some even joined the armed forces. These women were segregated from men in separate groups. Although women joined the workforce they still encountered discrimination in and out of the workplace, which persisted despite [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|anti-discrimination laws passed in the 1960s]].&lt;ref name="Emily Stoper 1991"/&gt;

Women who joined the armed forces participated in every military field except combat. One thousand female pilots joined the [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]], one hundred and forty thousand women joined the [[Women's Army Corps]] and one hundred thousand women joined the [[U.S. Navy]] as nurses and administrative staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=May |first=Elaine Tyler |title=Pushing the Limits |publisher=Oxford University |location=New York |year=1994 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two million women held office jobs during World War II, which offered job security because they had become "feminized".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hartmann |first=Susan M. |title=The Home Front and Beyond |publisher=G.K. Hall &amp; Co. |location=Boston |year=1982 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life in the working world ==
[[File:Pink 2.JPG|thumb|This graph shows the increase in women graduating high school and attending college, while there is a decrease in high school dropouts.]]

A typical job sought by working women was that of a [[switchboard operator|telephone operator]] or [[Hello Girls|Hello Girl]]. The Hello Girls began as women who operated on switchboards during the first world war by answering telephones and talking to impatient callers in a calming tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/news/topics/hello.html|title=Topics in Chronicling America-Hello Girls|last=|first=|date=January 29, 2015|website=The Library of Congress|access-date=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The workers would sit on stools facing a wall with hundreds of outlets and tiny blinking lights. The women had to work quickly when a light flashed by plugging the cord into the proper outlet. Despite the difficult work, many women wanted this job because it paid five dollars a week and provided a rest lounge for the employees to take a break.&lt;ref name="Catherine Gourley 2008"/&gt;

Female secretaries were also popular. They were instructed to be efficient, tough, and hardworking while also appearing soft, accommodating, and subservient.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Rung, Margaret C. (1997). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3116078 "Paternalism and Pink Collar: Gender and Federal Employee Relations,1941-50,"] ''The Business History Review'' '''399''' (3)&lt;/ref&gt; Women were expected to be the protector and partner to their boss behind closed doors and a helpmate in public. These women were encouraged to go to charm schools and express their personality through fashion instead of furthering their education.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

[[Social work]] became a female-dominated profession in the 1930s, emphasizing a group professional identity and the casework method.&lt;ref name="Susan Ware 1982"&gt;Ware 1982, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Social workers gave crucial expertise for the expansion of federal, state and local government, as well as services to meet the needs of the Depression.&lt;ref name="Susan Ware 1982"/&gt;

Teachers in primary and secondary schools remained female, although as the war progressed, women began to move on to better employment and higher salaries.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ware 1982, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, teaching positions paid less than $1,500 a year and fell to $800 in rural areas.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Women scientists found it hard to gain appointments at universities. Women scientists were forced to take positions in high schools, state or women's colleges, governmental agencies and alternative institutions such as libraries or museums.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Women who took jobs at such places often did clerical duties and though some held professional positions, these boundaries were blurred.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Mostly women were hired as librarians who had been professionalized and feminized. In 1920, women accounted for 88% of librarians in the United States.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Two-thirds of the [[American Geographical Society]] (AGS)'s employees were women, who served as librarians, editorial personnel in the publishing programs, secretaries, research editors, copy editors, proofreaders, research assistants and sales staff. These women came with credentials from well-known colleges and universities and many were overqualified for their positions, but later were promoted to more prestigious positions.

Although female employees did not receive equal pay, they did get sabbaticals to attend university and to travel for their professions at the cost of the AGS.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Monk, Janice (April 2003). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30033908 "Women's Worlds at the American Geographical Society,"] ''Geographical Review'' '''93''' (2): 237–257&lt;/ref&gt; Those women working managerial and library or museums positions made an impact on women in the work force, but still encountered discrimination when they tried to advance.

In the 1940s, clerical work expanded to occupy the largest number of women employees, this field diversified as it moved into commercial service.&lt;ref&gt;Susan M. Hartmann, The Home Front and Beyond (Boston, MA: G.K. Hall &amp;Co., 1982), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The average worker in the 1940s was over 35 years old, married, and needed to work to keep their families afloat.&lt;ref&gt;Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s, women were taught that marriage and domesticity were more important than a career. Most women followed this path because of the uncertainty of the post-war years.&lt;ref&gt;Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; Suburban housewives were encouraged to have hobbies like bread making and sewing. The 1950s housewife was in conflict between being "just a housewife" because their upbringing taught them competition and achievement. Many women had furthered their education deriving a sense of self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pay ===

A single woman working in a factory in the early 20th century earned less than $8 a week, which is equivalent to roughly less that $98 dollars a week today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/|title=US Inflation Calculator|website=US Inflation Calculator|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the woman was absent or was late, employers penalized them by docking their pay.&lt;ref name="Catherine Gourley 2008"&gt;Gourley 2008, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; These women would live in boarding houses costing $1.50 a week, waking at 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. to start their ten-hour work day. When women entered the paid workforce in the 1920s they were paid less than men because employers thought the women's jobs were temporary. Employers also paid women less than men because they believed in the "Pin Money Theory", which said that women's earnings were secondary to that of their male counterparts. With this being said, women took typical jobs that were "considerably less substantial than their husbands' in terms of both the average number of hours worked per week as well as continuity over time".&lt;ref name="Hilary Silver 1993"&gt;Silver, Hilary. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/684634 "Housework and Domestic Work,"] ''Sociological Forum'' 182 no.2 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; However, working women still experienced stress and overload because they were still responsible for the majority of the housework and taking care of the children. This left women isolated and subjected them to their husband's control.&lt;ref name="Hilary Silver 1993" /&gt;

In the early 1900s women's pay was one to three dollars a week and much of that went to living expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Jules (1991). ''Breaking Barriers'' (New York: The Penguin Group), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1900s female tobacco strippers earned five dollars a week, half of what their male coworkers made and [[seamstress]]es made six to seven dollars a week compared to a cutter's salary of $16.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Woloch 1984, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; This differed from women working in factories in the 1900s as they were paid by the piece, not receiving a fixed weekly wage.&lt;ref name="humowitz236-7"&gt;Humowitz Weissman 1978, pp. 236–237&lt;/ref&gt; Those that were pinching pennies pushed themselves to produce more product so that they earned more money.&lt;ref name="humowitz236-7" /&gt; Women who earned enough to live on found it impossible to keep their salary rate from being reduced because bosses often made "mistakes" in computing a worker's piece rate.&lt;ref name="Humowitz240"&gt;Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; As well as this, women who received this kind of treatment did not disagree for fear of losing their jobs. Employers would frequently deduct pay for work they deemed imperfect and for simply trying to lighten the mood by laughing or talking while they worked.&lt;ref name="Humowitz240" /&gt; In the 1937 a woman's average yearly salary was $525 compared to a man's salary of $1,027.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; In the 1940s two-thirds of the women who were in the labor force suffered a decrease in earnings; the average weekly paychecks fell from $50 to $37.&lt;ref name="Emily Stoper 1991" /&gt; This gap in wage stayed consistent, as women in 1991 only earned seventy percent of what men earned regardless of their education.&lt;ref name="Emily Stoper 1991"&gt;Stoper, Emily (May 1991). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1046935 "Women's Work, Women's Movement: Taking Stock,"] ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'' '''515''' pp. 151–152&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on in the 1970s and 1980s as women began to fight for equality, they fought against discrimination in jobs where women worked and the educational institutions that would lead to those jobs.&lt;ref name="Emily Stoper 1991" /&gt; In 1973 the average salaries for women were 57% compared to those of men, but this [[gender pay gap|gender earnings gap]] was especially noticeable in pink-collar jobs where the largest number of women were employed.&lt;ref&gt;Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; Women were given routine, less responsible jobs available and often with a lower pay than men. These jobs were monotonous and mechanical often with assembly-line procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, a study was carried out that examined the pay differences between single and married women. It was found that married women made substantially less than single women, as single women made up to 97% of what a single man would make and married women would only make up to 62% of married men's pay.&lt;ref name="Waldfogel 1995 584–610"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waldfogel|first=Jane|date=1995|title=The Price of Motherhood: Family Status and Women's Pay in Young British Cohort|jstor=2663545|journal=Oxford Economic Papers|volume=47|issue=4|pages=584–610}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was found to potentially be because of taking maternity leaves, as less work related experience would be gained in the time that these women left to care for their children, leading to less investment from the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waldfogel|first=Jane|date=1997|title=The Effect of Children on Women's Wages|jstor=2657300|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=62|issue=2|pages=209–217|doi=10.2307/2657300}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also found that women now are more likely to join or re-join the work force after having children, rather than the traditional role of becoming a stay at home mother.&lt;ref name="Waldfogel 1995 584–610"/&gt;

=== Education ===

Women entering the  workforce had difficulty finding a satisfactory job without references or an education.&lt;ref&gt;Gourley 2008, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; However, opportunities for [[higher education]] expanded as women were admitted to all-male schools like the [[United States service academies]] and [[Ivy League]] strongholds.&lt;ref&gt;Woloch 1984, p. 525&lt;/ref&gt; Education became a way for society to shape women into its ideal housewife. In the 1950s, authorities and educators encouraged college because they found new value in vocational training for domesticity.&lt;ref&gt;Woloch 1984, p. 500&lt;/ref&gt; College prepared women for future roles because while men and women were taught together, they were groomed for different paths after they graduated.&lt;ref&gt;Woloch 1984, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; Education started out as a way to teach women how to be a good wife, but education also allowed women to broaden their minds.

Being educated was an expectation for women entering the paying workforce, despite the fact that their male equivalents did not need a high school diploma.&lt;ref&gt;Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; While in college, a woman would experience extracurricular activities, such as a sorority, that offered a separate space for the woman to practice types of social service work that was expected from her.&lt;ref name="Nancy Woloch 1984"&gt;Woloch 1984, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all of a woman's education was done in the classroom. Women were also educated through their peers through "dating". Men and women no longer had to be supervised when alone together. Dating allowed men and women to practice the paired activities that would later become a way of life.&lt;ref name="Nancy Woloch 1984"/&gt;

New women's organizations sprouted up working to reform and protect women in the workplace. The largest and most prestigious of these organizations was The General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC), whose members were conservative middle-class housewives. The International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) was formed after women shirtwaist makers went on strike in New York City in 1909. It started as a small walkout, with a handful of members from one shop and grew to a force of ten of thousands, changing the course of the labor movement forever. In 1910 women allied themselves with the Progressive Party who sought to reform social issues.

Another organization that grew out of women in the workforce, was the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor. The Women's Bureau regulated conditions for women employees. As female labor became a crucial part of the economy, efforts by the Women's Bureau increased. The Bureau pushed for employers to take advantage of "women-power" and persuaded women to enter the employment market.

In 1913 the ILGWU signed the well-known "protocol in the Dress and Waist Industry" which was the first contract between labor and management settled by outside negotiators. The contract formalized the trade's division of labor by gender.

Another win for women came in 1921 when congress passed the Sheppard-Towner Act, a welfare measure intended to reduce infant and maternal mortality; it was the first federally funded healthcare act. The act provided federal funds to establish health centers for prenatal and child care. Expectant mothers and children could receive health checkups and health advice. &lt;!-- This paragraph seems to be more about the expansions of women's rights than it is about pink-collar workers, I would recommend taking it out Kali Moumblow (talk) 20:11, 16 November 2017 (UTC)) --&gt;

In 1963 the Equal Pay Act was passed making it the first federal law against sex discrimination, equal pay for equal work, and made employers hire women workers if they qualified from the start.

Unions also became a major outlet for women to fight against the unfair treatment they experienced. Women who joined these types of unions stayed before and after work to talk about the benefits of the union, collect dues, obtain charters, and form bargaining committees.

The National Recovery Administration (NRA) was approved in May 1933. The NRA negotiated codes designed to rekindle production. It raised wages, shortened workers' hours, and increased employment for the first time maximizing hour and minimizing wage provisions benefiting female workers. The NRA had its flaws however, it only covered half of the women in the workforce particularly manufacturing and trade. The NRA regulated working conditions only for women with a job and did not offer any relief for the two million unemployed women who desperately needed it.

The 1930s proved successful for women in the workplace thanks to federal relief programs and the growth of unions. For the first time women were not completely dependent on themselves, in 1933 the federal government expanded in its responsibility to female workers. In 1938 the Fair Labor Standards Act grew out of several successful strikes. Two million women joined the workforce during the Great Depression despite negative public opinion.

==Pink ghetto==
"'''Pink ghetto'''" is a term used to refer to jobs dominated by women. The term was coined in 1983 to describe the limits women have in furthering their careers, since the jobs are often dead-end, stressful and underpaid. The term ''pink ghetto'' is just simply another way of describing pink-collar work. ''Pink ghetto'' was more commonly used in the early years, when women were finally able to work. Pink-collar work became the popular term once it was popularized by Louise Kapp Howe, a writer and social critic, in the 1970s.

''Pink ghetto'' can also describe the placement of female managers into positions that will not lead them to the [[board room]], thus perpetuating the "[[glass ceiling]]". This includes managing areas such as human resources, customer service, and other areas that do not contribute to the corporate "bottom line". While this allows women to rise in ranks as a manager, their career eventually stalls out and they're excluded from the upper echelons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002727003_kleiman08.html |title=Pink-collar workers fight to leave "ghetto" |first=Carol |last=Kleiman |work=[[Seattle Times]] |date=8 January 2006 |accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thenewagenda.net/2009/02/10/promises-unkept-in-the-enduring-pink-ghetto |title=Promises Unkept in the Enduring Pink Ghetto |first=Gretchen |last=Glasscock |work=The New Agenda |date=2009-02-10 |accessdate= 2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.womenssportsfoundation.org/Content/Articles/Issues/Equity-Issues/P/Posting-Up-in-the-Pink-Ghetto.aspx |title=Posting Up in the Pink Ghetto |first=Sarah |last=Murray |work=[[Women's Sports Foundation]] |date=2008-01-08 |accessdate=2010-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616054423/http://womenssportsfoundation.org/Content/Articles/Issues/Equity-Issues/P/Posting-Up-in-the-Pink-Ghetto.aspx |archivedate=16 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Male integration ==
Scholars such as Judy Wajcman argue that technology has long been monopolized by men and is a great source of their power historically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=BtaiFSv09jMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR6&amp;dq=technology+displaces+jobs+for+men&amp;ots=KDnJauxEJQ&amp;sig=OWtNUf_MqgUz-VTNZPDigVtTJEY#v=onepage&amp;q=technology%20displaces%20jobs%20for%20men&amp;f=false|title=Feminism Confronts Technology|last=Wajcman|first=Judy|date=1991|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0271008024|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more millennial men are doing pink collar work because technology is affecting blue collar work. Machines are able to perform many of the tasks that were typically gendered male within factories. In a 1990 study conducted by Allan H. Hunt and Timothy L. Hunt, they examined how industrial robots would impact both the creation of jobs as well as job displacement among unskilled workers in the United States. It was concluded that the impact of unemployment due to the spread of robotics would be felt the greatest by uneducated, unskilled blue-collar workers. New technology in the form of robotics eliminates many semi or unskilled jobs, and has taken traditional men filled roles away from the job market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L.|first=Hunt, H. Allan{{!}}Hunt, Timothy|date=1983-00-00|title=Human Resource Implications of Robotics.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED228547|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judy Wajman maintains that skills involving machines and strength are associated with masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Male Designs on Technology|last=Wajman|first=Judy|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the least technical jobs (pink-collar) jobs are associated with women. These machines designed by men, using the technology they have always monopolized, are now displacing them and forcing them into feminized pink-collar work.

It was found as well that men going into traditionally claimed pink collar jobs are felt discriminated and threatened in their jobs.&lt;ref name="Kalokerinos 553–565"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalokerinos|first=Elise K.|last2=Kjelsaas|first2=Kathleen|last3=Bennetts|first3=Steven|last4=von Hippel|first4=Courtney|date=2017-08-01|title=Men in pink collars: Stereotype threat and disengagement among male teachers and child protection workers|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2246/abstract|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|language=en|volume=47|issue=5|pages=553–565|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2246|issn=1099-0992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men going into positions such as teaching, nursing and childcare faced many negative stereotypes in these lines of work, as men have traditionally been viewed as stern, strong and holding dominant attitudes. This stereotype about men negatively impacts men in these lines of work, as it is expected that a woman with the same position would be more nurturing, caring and well suited for the work.&lt;ref name="Kalokerinos 553–565"/&gt;

His father, Hossein Zarrab, had a close relationship with [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/05/iran-babak-zanjani-reza-zarrab-corruption-cases.html|title=The downfall of two Iranian tycoons|first=|last=mshabani|date=9 May 2016|website=al-monitor.com|accessdate=3 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020191142/https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/05/iran-babak-zanjani-reza-zarrab-corruption-cases.html#|archive-date=2017-10-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who served as the [[President of Iran]] between 2005 and 2013. The U.S. Department of Treasury accused Hossein Zarrab of violating U.S. sanctions on Iran and slapped a $9.1 million fine against him. His fine reduced to $2.3 million following his colloboration with the U.S. officials.&lt;ref name="hurriyet.com.tr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/yazarlar/tolga-tanis/zarrabi-kim-tc-vatandasi-yapti-40113274|title=Zarrab’ı kim TC vatandaşı yaptı|website=hurriyet.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zarrab was arrested by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] in Miami in the US on March 19, 2016 and was accused of bank fraud, money laundering and helping the Iranian government in evading the US economic sanctions on Iran to hinder its nuclear-weapons program. His charges; conspiracy to defraud, violating the [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]], money laundering, and bank fraud; could bring up to 70 years in prison if found guilty in the U.S. Federal Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/turkish-national-arrested-conspiring-evade-us-sanctions-against-iran-money-laundering-and|title=Turkish National Arrested for Conspiring to Evade U.S. Sanctions Against Iran, Money Laundering and Bank Fraud|website=www.justice.gov|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Zarrab was born in Tabriz to [[Iranian Azerbaijani]] parents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://iranwire.com/fa/projects/4057 | title=حاشیه‌های بازداشت تاجر ایرانی در ترکیه؛ از بابک زنجانی تا مشایی

In 2008, Reza Zarrab married to a Turkish pop star, [[Ebru Gündeş]] and had a child in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iha.com.tr/haber-reza-zarrab-kimdir-reza-zarrabin-hayati-ebru-gundesin-esi-reza-zarrab-317902/|title=Reza Zarrab kimdir?

He founded Royal Holding with his brother Mohammed Zarrab (Can Sarraf) in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://royalholding.com.tr/index.php?royalholding=hakkimizda{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zarrab’s chauffeur, Turgut Harpani, was arrested by the Turkish Customs Protection agency during his trip to Russia from Turkey in 2011 for carrying $150 millions in cash and was accused of conducting illegal money couriering, but he was then released by Turkish authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.milliyet.com.tr/gundes-in-esinin-soforu-kacakciliktan-gozaltinda-magazin-1377987/|title=Gündeş’in eşinin şoförü kaçakçılıktan gözaltında – Magazin Haberleri|website=milliyet.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.haberturk.com/yasam/haber/620972-soforunde-150-milyon-dolar|title=Şoföründe 150 milyon dolar!|website=haberturk.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Happani shared his own pictures on Facebook with suitcases full of money. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/operasyonu_baslatan_fotograf_balya_balya_dolar-1166808/|title=Operasyonu başlatan fotoğraf: Facebook'ta balya balya dolar! – Türkiye Haberleri – Radikal|first=|last=Radikal|website=radikal.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkish National Intelligence Agency (MIT) urged then Prime Minister Erdoğan in April 2013 about Zarrab’s corrupted relations with the Turkish cabinet members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://birgun.net/haber/mitten-erdogana-sarraf-raporu-12357.html|title=MİT'ten Erdoğan'a Sarraf raporu – BirGün.net – Halkın Gazetesi BirGün|date=19 March 2014|website=archive.org|accessdate=3 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319222958/http://birgun.net/haber/mitten-erdogana-sarraf-raporu-12357.html|archivedate=19 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zarrab received an “exceptional citizenship” and became a Turkish citizen with the decision given by the Turkish Council of Ministers on June 1, 2007.&lt;ref name="hurriyet.com.tr"/&gt; He was accused of bribing $1.5 million to receive Turkish Citizenship in the indictment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.milliyet.com.tr/5-milyon-dolara-turk-vatandasi/gundem/detay/1809571/default.htm|title=5 milyon dolara Türk vatandaşı oldular – Son Dakika Haberler|website=milliyet.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013 corruption scandal in Turkey==
{{main|2013 corruption scandal in Turkey}}
Zarrab, who has a business affiliation with the Iranian billionaire and [[business magnate]] [[Babak Zanjani]], was detained in Istanbul on 17 December 2013 due to his involvement with the sons of three ministers ([[Erdoğan Bayraktar]], [[Muammer Güler]] and [[Zafer Çağlayan]]) in the [[Government of Turkey|Turkish government]] and [[Egemen Bağış]], the former minister for EU Affairs and Turkey's chief negotiator in accession talks with the [[European Union]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/uc_bakana_rusvet_suclamasi-1166735 | title=Üç bakana rüşvet suçlaması | date=2013-12-18 | agency=Radikal | accessdate=2013-12-18 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219021159/http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/uc_bakana_rusvet_suclamasi-1166735# | archive-date=2013-12-19 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://t24.com.tr/haber/yolsuzluk-ve-rusvet-sorusturmasinda-egemen-bagis-goruntuleri-de-cikti/246398 | title=Yolsuzluk ve rüşvet soruşturmasında Egemen Bağış görüntüleri de çıktı!

The investigation in Turkey revealed a system to help Iran bypass US sanctions against the country concerning the [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication|SWIFT]] payment system, in a scheme based on Turkish public bank [[Halkbank]], whereby money was transferred to front companies in [[China]] and Turkey, and [[gold]] bought with that money transferred to Iran via [[Dubai]].&lt;ref name=almonitor /&gt;

Then Interior Minister [[Muammer Güler]]’s son, Barış Güler, then Economy Minister [[Zafer Çağlayan|Zafer Çaglayan]]’s son, Kaan Çaglayan, and General Director of Halk Bank, Suleyman Arslan, were among the suspects including Reza Zarrab. They were arrested due to accusations of “bribery, professional misconduct, bid rigging, and smuggling”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/amp/2-bakan-oglu-ile-reza-zarrab-tutuklandi-25412674|title=2 Bakan oğlu ile Reza Zarrab tutuklandı – Son Dakika Haberler|website=www.hurriyet.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.hurriyet.com.tr/uc-bakanin-oglu-gozaltinda-25378920|title=Üç bakanın oğlu gözaltında|website=hurriyet.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erdogan backlashed and announced the investigation as a “judicial coup” against his government, and dismissed the prosecutors and police officials investigating the corruption scheme. After a 70-day detainment, Zarrab and the sons of cabinet members were released from jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/amp/reza-zarrab-ve-bakan-cocuklari-tahliye-edildi-25912625|title=Reza Zarrab ve Bakan çocukları tahliye edildi – Son Dakika Haberler|website=www.hurriyet.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erdogan received harsh criticism for obstructing and undermining justice and putting the judiciary under his executive authority. However, Erdogan announced that “justice has been served”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/amp/haber/siyaset/46077/Erdogan__Adalet_yerini_buldu.html|title=Erdoğan: Adalet yerini buldu|website=cumhuriyet.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egemen Bağış, then Minister of European Union Affairs, was dismissed after the corruption investigation. The Ministers of Interior Affairs, Economic Relations, and Environment and Urbanization – Muammer Güler, Zafer Çaglayan, and Erdoğan Bayraktar, respectively – had to resign from their positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/turkce/haberler/2014/12/141212_17_25_aralik_operasyonu_neler_oldu_10_soruda|title=10 soruda: 17–25 Aralık operasyonları|first=Mahmut Hamsici BBC|last=Türkçe|website=BBC Türkçe|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indictment charged high-ranked officials with significant accusations for receiving bribes: Zafer Caglayan received $52 million worth of bribes; Muammer Guler received $10 million worth of bribes; and Egemen Bağış received $1.5 million worth of bribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/amp/haber/turkiye/29997/Bagis__Caglayan_ve_Guler_kac_TL_rusvet_almakla_suclaniyor_.html|title=Bağış, Çağlayan ve Güler kaç TL rüşvet almakla suçlanıyor?|website=cumhuriyet.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The summary of proceedings were sent to the Turkish parliament for the vote on whether to lift ministers’ immunity and send them to court. However, given the strong majority of Erdoğan's ruling party (AKP), in January 2015 the parliament did not lift their immunity and swept away the significant investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/amp/haber/turkiye/191219/AKP_li_vekiller_4_eski_bakan_icin_vicdanlarini_sifirladilar.html|title=AKP'li vekiller 4 eski bakan için vicdanlarını sıfırladılar|website=cumhuriyet.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, Erdoğan announced that he initiated a “witch-hunt” against the Gulen movement for, as he alleged, being behind the corruption investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.t24.com.tr/amp/haber/erdogan-cadi-aviysa-biz-bu-cadi-avini-yapacagiz-bunu-da-bilin,258112|title=Erdoğan: Cadı avıysa, biz bu cadı avını yapacağız, bunu da bilin! – Gündem – T24|website=m.t24.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months after this announcement, the government arrested and detained police officials who conducted the corruption investigation. The prosecutors of the corruption investigation were also dismissed from their positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.haberturk.com/gundem/haber-amp/1273102-17-25-aralikin-fetocu-polislerine-operasyon|title=17–25 Aralık'ın FETÖ'cü polislerine operasyon – Gündem Haberleri|website=m.haberturk.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.mynet.com/1725-aralik-savcilarina-ihrac-guncel-1835160|title=1725 Aralık savcılarına ihraç|first=|last=Aljazeera|website=mynet.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Erdoğan has alleged that Zarrab conducted trade and business in aligned with Turkish interests, there have been several reports that suggest Zarrab’s illegal activities extensively harmed the Turkish economy.&lt;ref&gt;https://washingtonhatti.com/2017/09/13/zarrab-caglayan-gercekten-ulke-cikarina-mi-calisti-ust-d +uzey-yo neticid en-perde-arkasi/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest in the United States==
On 19 March 2016, Zarrab was arrested in [[Miami]], Florida, for conspiring to evade [[U.S. sanctions against Iran]] (by using his gold business to help Iran’s government evade the sanctions),&lt;ref name="The Economist" /&gt; [[money laundering]] and [[bank fraud]]. He was later indicted by a grand jury with charges that could bring up to 75 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/turkish-national-arrested-conspiring-evade-us-sanctions-against-iran-money-laundering-and|title=Turkish National Arrested for Conspiring to Evade U.S. Sanctions Against Iran, Money Laundering and Bank Fraud – OPA – Department of Justice|date=3 April 2016|website=archive.org|accessdate=3 November 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403002020/https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/turkish-national-arrested-conspiring-evade-us-sanctions-against-iran-money-laundering-and|archivedate=3 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-zarrab/u-s-arrests-turkish-businessman-for-scheme-to-evade-iran-sanctions-idUSKCN0WN295|title=U.S. arrests Turkish businessman accused of evading Iran sanctions|date=21 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2017|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney for the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern District of New York]], led by [[Preet Bharara]],&lt;ref name="The Economist" /&gt; with assistance from a trial attorney of the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.&lt;ref name=dofj/&gt;

During the case, prosecutors have noted that Zarrab donated $4.5 million to a charity founded by [[Emine Erdoğan]], the wife of former prime minister and now president of Turkey [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].&lt;ref name="The Economist" /&gt; Prosecutors stated that Zarrab has "close ties" to Erdoğan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US prosecutors say businessman with 'close ties' to Turkey's Erdogan poses flight risk|url=http://www.dw.com/en/us-prosecutors-say-businessman-with-close-ties-to-turkeys-erdogan-poses-flight-risk/a-19283437|work=Deutsche Welle|date=26 May 2016|accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Zarrab's arrest, shares in [[Halk Bankası|Halkbank]], whose CEO was among those charged with taking bribes from Zarrab, had fallen by 20%.&lt;ref name="The Economist" /&gt; He has offered to pay $50 million to be granted a [[bail]].&lt;ref name="The Economist" /&gt; Bail has been denied.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In their brief against granting bail, prosecutors had argued that "if the defendant were able to reach Turkish soil, he could cause the highest levels of Turkish government to block his return to the United States."&lt;ref name="The Economist" /&gt;

In April 2017, media reported that negotiations involving the U.S. and Turkish governments were undergoing, to the effect that Zarrab would be extradited to Turkey while in return "Turkey would be much less resistant to the US’s missions in Syria, and primarily its support to the [[Democratic Union Party (Syria)|PYD]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rudy Giuliani, the jailed Turkish gold trader and the secret meeting with Erdogan |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/rudy-giuliani-the-jailed-turkish-gold-trader-and-the-secret-meeting-with-erdogan-1.3056527|publisher=The Irish Times|date=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most striking arguments in the indictment about Zarrab was that the Zarrab family sent a letter addressed to the president of Iran’s Central Bank and stated that he was ready for "Economic Jihad" against sanctions on Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.occrp.org/en/azerbaijanilaundromat/notorious-laundromats-used-in-irans-anti-sanction-economic-jihad|title=Notorious Laundromats Used in Iran’s Anti-Sanction ‘Economic Jihad’ – OCCRP|first=Paul Radu and Khadija|last=Ismayilova|website=occrp.org|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erdoğan's first comment on Zarrab’s arrest by the United States government was: “it was not a case that interests Turkey".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntv.com.tr/amp/turkiye/cumhurbaskani-erdogandan-riza-sarraf-aciklamasi,FGvKyWPapEWAqp0sNaMv4g|title=Cumhurbaşkanı Erdoğan'dan Rıza Sarraf açıklaması – NTV|website=www.ntv.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is claimed that Erdoğan, on September 21, 2016 during a special meeting with then Vice President [[Joe Biden]], requested Zarrab's release from jail and prosecutor Bharara to be dismissed from his position. Also, it is claimed that Erdogan’s wife, [[Emine Erdoğan|Emine Erdogan]], did a similar request to Biden’s wife, [[Jill Biden]]. Furthermore, [[Bekir Bozdağ|Bekir Bozdag]], the Turkish Minister of Justice, visited the [[United States Attorney General]] [[Loretta Lynch|Loretta E. Lynch]] in October 2016 and stated how the Zarrab case was unfounded and that Zarrab should be released&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2017/10/16/tl-preet-bharara-trukey-trump-jake-tapper.cnn|title=Bharara on whether Turkey pushed for his ouster – CNN Video|website=cnn.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/opinions/global-opinions/the-man-at-the-crux-the-of-us-turkey-dispute-is-about-to-go-on-trial/2017/10/12/92c4c7a2-af96-11e7-be94-fabb0f1e9ffb_story.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time, it came out that Zarrab's attorneys, [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph W. Giuliani,]] a former New York City mayor, and [[Michael Mukasey|Michael B. Mukasey]], who served as attorney general in President George W. Bush’s administration, held a secret meeting with Erdoğan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/nyregion/rudy-giuliani-reza-zarrab-iran-sanctions-case.html?referer=https://www.google.com.ua/|title=Why Giuliani Held a Secret Meeting With Turkey’s Leader|website=mobile.nytimes.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halkbank Deputy Chief Executive Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who was in connection with Zarrab, was arrested in the United States in March 2017 with the charges of "conspiring to evade US sanctions against Iran and other offenses”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/turkish-banker-arrested-conspiring-evade-us-sanctions-against-iran-and-other-offenses|title=Turkish Banker Arrested For Conspiring To Evade U.S. Sanctions Against Iran And Other Offenses|website=www.justice.gov|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, it was announced in September 2017 that the US charged then Turkish Minister of Economic Affairs [[Zafer Çağlayan|Zafer Caglayan]] and former General Manager of Halk Bank Suleyman Aslan with offenses similar to Zarrab's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://washingtonhatti.com/2017/03/29/m-hakan-atilla-iddianamesinde-halkbanka-cok-agir-suclamalar-cikti/|title=M.Hakan Atilla Yakalama Kararında Halkbank'a Çok Ağır Suçlamalar Çıktı -|website=washingtonhatti.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-turkish-minister-economy-former-general-manager-turkish-government-owned-bank|title=Former Turkish Minister Of The Economy, Former General Manager Of Turkish Government-Owned Bank, And Two Other Individuals Charged With Conspiring To Evade U.S. Sanctions Against Iran And Other Offenses|website=www.justice.gov|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erdoğan appeared to be involved in the allegations about the US investigation. It was claimed that Erdogan's effort to save Zarrab was the fear that the inquiry had reached him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/world/europe/turkey-new-york-case.html|title=Why a New York Court Case Has Rattled Turkey’s President|first1=Patrick|last1=Kingsley|first2=Benjamin|last2=Weiser|date=14 October 2017|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2017|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also alleged that Erdoğan wanted the US to release Zarrab in return for the detained US citizen pastor Andrew Brunson being held in a prison in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/democracy-post/wp/2017/07/07/why-trump-should-not-swap-prisoners-with-erdogan/|title=Opinion – Why Trump should not swap prisoners with Erdogan|website=Washington Post|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metin Topuz, a Turkish employee of the US Consulate General in Istanbul, was arrested on October 4, 2017 for espionage, being a member of crime network, and taking the evidences of the 2013 corruption investigation to the US. In the arrest warrant, it is emphasized that the main suspects of the December 17th corruption investigation were “foreign intelligence agencies and countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gazete.netgazete.com/gazeteler.php?id=20|title=Takvim Gazetesi|website=gazete.netgazete.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

As a response to the arrest, the US Embassy in Turkey announced on October 8, 2017, that "visa applications from Turkey were suspended."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberght.com/haberler/haber/2055744-abd-vizeleri-askiya-aldi|title=ABD Türkiye'den vize başvurularını askıya aldı – Bloomberg HT|website=bloomberght.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 16, 2017, ''NBC News,'' reported that Zarrab is now cooperating with federal prosecutors in a [[Money laundering|money-laundering]] case and that he was then out of jail, a move President Erdoğan had been desperately hoping to avoid&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/does-cooperating-witness-have-info-flynn-tie-turkey-n821341|title=Does cooperating witness have info on Flynn tie to Turkey?|work=NBC News|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is thought that Zarrab is [[Robert Mueller]]'s key to taking down Michael T. Flynn in the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)|2017 Special Counsel Investigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/did-the-feds-flip-turkish-businessman-reza-zarraband-could-he-bring-down-michael-flynn|title=Did the Feds Flip Turkish Businessman Reza Zarrab—and Could He Bring Down Michael Flynn?|last=Zavadski|first=Katie|date=2017-11-16|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/turkish-iranian-businessman-zarrab-gold-trade-erdogan-ties-iran-sanctions-case-reported-cooperating-us-prosecutors/28859053.html|title=Man Accused In U.S. Iran Sanctions Case Reported Working With Prosecutors|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Zarrab's release from detention to another facility inside the United States, the Turkish government expressed concern as to the status of Zarrab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/11/turkey-demands-info-reza-zarrab.html|title=Turkey demands news as Zarrab drops off radar|last=kjenson|date=2017-11-16|work=Al-Monitor|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-us|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6vOW5patk?url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/11/turkey-demands-info-reza-zarrab.html|archivedate=2017-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, Zarrab reappeared in Manhattan court as a witness in the case against Atilla, having accepted a plea deal with federal prosecutors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/gold-trader-zarrab-will-be-star-witness-iran-sanction-busting-n824351|title=Gold trader Zarrab will be star witness in Iran sanction-busting trial|publisher=NBC News|date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A day after Zarrab testified in US Federal District Court, the Turkish government seized the assets of his and his family, including his wife Ebru Gündeş.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/world/europe/erdogan-turkey-iran-sanctions.html |title=Turkey Seizes Assets of Reza Zarrab, Witness in Sanctions-Evasion Case |author=Benjamin Weiser |date=1 December 2017 |website=[[NYTimes.com]] |access-date=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Zarrab is married to the Turkish singer [[Ebru Gündeş]]. They have one child together. Ebru Gündeş reportedly filed for divorce in September 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/son-dakika-haberi-ebru-gundes-ile-reza-zarrab-bosaniyor-40230898|title=Ebru Gündeş'ten 'boşanma' için ilk açıklama|language=Turkish|publisher=Hürriyet|date=25 September 2016|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the couple reconciled shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/bosanma-davasinda-surpriz-gelisme-40314705|title=Reza Zarrab ile Ebru Gündeş'in boşanma davasında sürpriz gelişme|language=Turkish|publisher=Hürriyet|date=4 August 2017|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Export award==
In June 2015, Zarrab received the Turkish Export Award jointly from the hands of [[Prime Minister of Turkey|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Numan Kurtulmuş]], [[Ministry of Economy (Turkey)|Minister of Economy]] [[Nihat Zeybekçi]], and President of the Turkish Exporters Council Mehmet Büyükekşi, in a ceremony attended by President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mashreghnews.ir/fa/news/432684/%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%AA-%D8%AA%D8%B1%DA%A9%DB%8C%D9%87-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%B1%D8%B6%D8%A7-%D8%B6%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%AC%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B2%D9%87-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%B9%DA%A9%D8%B3 |title=دولت ترکیه به رضا ضراب جایزه داد +عکس|publisher=[[Mashregh]] |date= |accessdate=2015-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reza Zarrab'a ihracat ödülü |trans-title=Export award for Reza Zarrab |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/reza-zarraba-ihracat-odulu-29344202 |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |date=22 June 2015 |accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ricardo Belmont 3.jpg|thumb|Ricardo Belmont Cassinelli]]
'''Ricardo Belmont Cassinelli''' is a [[Peru]]vian [[TV network]] owner and politician. He was the mayor of [[Lima]]&lt;ref name="FoxFox1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fox|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Fox|first2=Fox de Cardona|title=Latin American broadcasting: from tango to telenovela|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9g63lxssFP8C&amp;pg=PA87|accessdate=7 April 2011|year=1997|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-1-86020-515-6|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1990 to 1995. He was popularly known as "El Hermanón" (Big Brother) for his friendliness and also as "El Colora'o" (Ginger) because of his reddish hair.

==Career==
Ricardo Belmont is the son of Augusto Belmont Bar, who founded TV Bego Excelsior (Channel 11 in Peru) in 1967. TV Bego Excelsior also owned Excelsior FM radio (104.7 FM in Peru). The younger Belmont was an avid sportsman who enjoyed [[soccer]] and [[boxing]], and was a patron of players in both sports. His sports passion would later influence him in his political speeches, using sporting terms such as "let's all kick into the same goal post", and, during his reelection bid, "Second half time is about to start, and it's works vs. words. Choose the tree [his electoral [[symbol]]] and we'll win the game." In his "serious" life, he dedicated himself to [[journalism]], befriending several local and national politicians all the while aspiring to be his own man in the media business. In his spare time he also dedicated his life to worthy causes, the most prominent being the local '''Telethon''' (based on the American version by [[Jerry Lewis]]), dedicated to helping the disabled kids at the San Juan de Dios Clinic in Lima.

In 1986 he took over Channel 11 and renamed it Red Bicolor de Comunicaciones (''Bicolor Communications Network''; the initials RBC allude to his personal name). Initially airing only from noon to midnight, Belmont mostly purchased American programming such as [[Bonanza]], [[Get Smart]], [[Bravestarr]], and [[The Twilight Zone]] (the 1985 version). The few RBC-produced shows included "Desafio Familiar", which was a Peruvian version of [[Family Feud]], "Habla el Pueblo", a [[Larry King]]-inspired talk show with Belmont himself as host, and "Mirando la Música", a [[music video]] program. In the late 1980s RBC started diversifying to break out of the niche market to compete with the Peruvian Big Two, America Television and Panamericana Television. RBC Radio 980 AM was mostly sports talk, while 91.9 FM was adult contemporary, in addition to Excelsior, which was mostly tropical and salsa.

In 1990 he announced his candidacy for the Lima provincial mayoralty as an independent. His political party, OBRAS (Works) alluded to the need for public works in Lima and the overall lack of progress as mayor by [[Jorge del Castillo Gálvez]], who was seen more as a lackey of Peruvian President [[Alan García]] than as an effective mayor. Although he supported [[Mario Vargas Llosa]]'s Presidential candidacy, he chose to oppose Vargas Llosa's party's chosen mayoral candidate, [[Juan Inchaustegui]]. Belmont's charisma developed as a TV host and his lack of political affiliation helped him earn the people's vote, and he began to start his public-works program, which included several road and community improvement projects detailed below.

Initially Belmont and the new Peruvian president, [[Alberto Fujimori]], were seen as comrades in arms because of their common political backgrounds as independents. The fiercely independent Belmont, however, drawing on his business skills, was able to get funds from several private enterprises to fund his programs.

Among the many public works projects he completed include:
*Intercambio Vial Norte (Northern Interchange): was a paving of Avenida Universitaria linking Carabayllo and San Miguel districts, with an interchange with Panamericana Norte along the way.
*Intercambio Vial Este (Eastern Interchange): was a combination of two new bridges spanning the Rimac River linking El Agustino directly with San Juan de Lurigancho
*Intercambio Vial Sur (Southern Interchange): was an actual [[Interchange (road)|interchange]] between Panamericana Sur, Av. Circunvalacion and Av. Javier Prado that eliminated traffic light crossings.
*Several ''losa deportiva''s (sports grounds) for poor communities, mostly [[concrete]] fields for mini-soccer, basketball, and squash.

Elected to a second term in 1994, Belmont and Fujimori had a falling out, due to resentment from Fujimori at Belmont's former support of Vargas Llosa. Fujimori, through his party-controlled Congress, issued Legislative Decree No. 776, by which provincial mayors were forced to distribute their government income down to the distrital halls under them (particularly from rich to poor distrital municipalities in the interior of the country). This stopped Belmont from pursuing further public works and improvements, and the municipal employees (most of whom were APRA party members left over from the Castillo administration) began turning against him through demonstrations, increasing his unpopularity.

'''Selah Brewster Strong''' (May 1, 1792 [[Brookhaven, New York|Brookhaven]], [[Suffolk County, New York]] – November 29, 1872 [[Setauket-East Setauket, New York|Setauket]], Suffolk Co, NY) was an American lawyer and politician from [[New York (state)|New York]].

==Life==
He was born on May 1, 1792&lt;ref name=Dwight623&gt;Dwight, 623&lt;/ref&gt; at Brookhaven, New York, the son of Judge Thomas Sheppard Strong and Hannah Brewster. His mother was the daughter of Joseph Brewster, of Setauket and Rebecca Mills. She was also a descendant of Elder [[William Brewster (pilgrim)|William Brewster]], (c. 1567 – April 10, 1644), the Pilgrim leader and spiritual elder of the [[Plymouth Colony]] and a passenger on the ''[[Mayflower]]'', through his son [[Jonathan Brewster]]. [This lineage appeared in some genealogies of the Strong family.  However, she was actually descended from Rev. Nathaniel Brewster of New Haven and his wife Sarah Ludlow. They died in the Town of Brookhaven.]  She was also a descendant of Lt. Gov. [[Roger Ludlow]].

He was also a descendant of [[Lion Gardiner]],  an early English settler and soldier in the New World, founded the first [[English people|English]] settlement in what became the state of [[New York (state)|New York]]. His legacy includes [[Gardiners Island]] which remains in the family and is the largest privately owned island in the United States.&lt;ref name=Gardiner84&gt;Gardiner, 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lamb637&gt;Lamb, 637&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Yale College]] in 1811.&lt;ref name=Dwight623&gt;Dwight, 623&lt;/ref&gt; He studied law, was admitted to the [[barlaw|bar]] in 1814, and commenced practice in [[New York City]].

He married on August 14, 1823, Cornelia Udall, who was born at Islip, Long Island, New York on  March 20, 1806 the daughter of Dr. Richard Udall and Prudence Carll, dau. of Silas Carll of Huntington, Long Island, New York.&lt;ref name=Dwight623&gt;Dwight, 623&lt;/ref&gt;  She was the sister of [[Richard Udall]], who studied law under Strong.

During the [[War of 1812]] he was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] and [[quartermaster]] in the 10th Regiment, Third Brigade, New York City and County Troops, and in 1815 was promoted successively to [[lieutenant]] and [[captain (U.S. Army)|captain]]. He was [[New York Court of Chancery|master in chancery]] in 1817, moved to Brookhaven in 1820, and was District Attorney of Suffolk County from 1821 to 1847, except for nine months in 1830. He was appointed [[judge advocate]] of the First Division of the New York State Infantry in 1825.

He was elected as a [[USDemocrat|Democrat]] to the [[28th United States Congress]], and served from March 4, 1843, to March 3, 1845. Afterwards he resumed the practice of law. In March 1846, he was appointed Judge of the [[New York State Circuit Courts|Second Judicial Circuit]], but did not take office. He was a justice of the [[New York Supreme Court]] (2nd District] from 1847 to 1849 and from 1852 to 1859, and was [[ex officio]] a judge of the [[New York Court of Appeals]] in 1849 and 1859. He was a delegate to the [[New York State Constitutional Convention]] of 1867–68. He died in 1872; interment was on his estate.&lt;ref name=Dwight623&gt;Dwight, 623&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the initial focus was on IT services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10799-015-0239-z|title=Defining the relationships between IT service management and IT service governance|first1=Marko|last1=Jäntti|first2=Virpi|last2=Hotti|date=30 June 2015|journal=Information Technology and Management|volume=17|issue=2|pages=141–150|accessdate=17 October 2018|doi=10.1007/s10799-015-0239-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2018}} it can include accounting, business administration, and other internal service sectors. Institutionalizing these services enables the monitoring and control of risk, value, and cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=AXELOS|title=Adopting Service Governance: Governing Portfolio Value for Sound Corporate Citizenship|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=9780113314652|page=6|date=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Principle among the issues is the fair funding for each service and the allocation system for scarce services. 

Institutionalizing internal corporate services is the corporate management equivalent a [[General Ledger|general ledger]], only with the line items reflecting the services, not simply departments. The service portfolio allows the governance of services as a means to govern the organization by [[Value (ethics)|value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Betz |first1=Charles T. |title=Architecture and patterns for IT service management, resource planning, and governance : making shoes for the cobbler's children |date=2007 |publisher=Elsevier/Morgan Kaufmann |isbn=9780123705938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service portfolio==
The portfolio of services is a list of all internal services within the organization that is available outside their own department. The portfolio describes each service, how it is funded, associated costs, ownership boundaries, along with its current performance and identified conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://service-governance.org/index.php?title=Best_Practice/Service_Portfolio |title=Service Portfolio |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222074953/http://service-governance.org/index.php?title=Best_Practice/Service_Portfolio |archivedate=December 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=October 2018}} This portfolio contains all services in the organization, including those which have been [[Outsourcing|outsourced]] and are now supplied to the organization by third parties.

The portfolio provides a map of the organization that provides directors with a different way of understanding the dynamics of the organization than that received from financial reports, and, thus, makes it easier for the board to make decisions based on accurate, contemporaneous information.

==Value==
Service governance uses the methods described in the management of value (MoV) to discover the requirements of the organization and to use those on design services, and their measures to deliver those values.&lt;ref&gt;Vásquez, W. (2013). An economic valuation of water connections under different approaches of service governance. Water Resources and Economics, 2-3, 17-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of research on service-oriented systems and non-functional properties : future directions |publisher=IGI Global (701 E. Chocolate Avenue, Hershey, Pennsylvania, 17033, USA) |isbn=978-1-61350-432-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement and compliance==
Well established best practice methods are used to design measures and metrics for the organization. These are designed to meet the requirements of the corporate mission, charter, and policy. This ensures that they measure what is required by the organization and, thus, supply accurate real-time information to the board for strategic governance decisions, and to management for operational decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cai |first1=Hongming |last2=Xu |first2=Lida |last3=Xu |first3=Boyi |last4=Zhang |first4=Pengzhu |last5=Guo |first5=Jingzhi |last6=Zhang |first6=Yuran |title=A service governance mechanism based on process mining for cloud-based applications |journal=Enterprise Information Systems |date=22 February 2018 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1080/17517575.2018.1442933}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gómez-Baggethun |first1=Erik |last2=Kelemen |first2=Eszter |last3=Martín-López |first3=Berta |last4=Palomo |first4=Ignacio |last5=Montes |first5=Carlos |title=Scale Misfit in Ecosystem Service Governance as a Source of Environmental Conflict |journal=Society &amp; Natural Resources |date=October 2013 |volume=26 |issue=10 |pages=1202–1216 |doi=10.1080/08941920.2013.820817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This also ensures compliance with the requirements of Audit as well as enabling the production of the financial and sustainability report and reporting on good corporate citizenship.

== Enterprise service management ==
Enterprise service management (ESM) is a means of extending service management across an entire organization, often from IT service management ([[ITSM]]). It is a component of service governance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://service-governance.org/index.php?title=Enterprise_Service_Management] {{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESM provides an integrated view of core service business processes, often in real-time, using common databases. ESM systems track business resources—people, parts, assets—and the status of customer commitments: service requests, orders, repairs, and SLAs. The applications that make up the system share data across various departments (customer service, technical support, sales, field service, etc.) that use the information for their work. ESM facilitates information flow between departments and coordinates activities with external resources involved in the service business process.

Enterprise service management is also a term used to sometimes generically describe the use of [[Service (business)|service]] processes and technologies across an organization. It is meant to be a broader term (like ERP and EAM) in contrast to [[IT Service Management|IT service management]] which only concerns the management of IT services.  

==History==
The term has been used to describe the success that a number of organizations have had in using the ''Best Practice'' advice, found in frameworks such as [[ITIL]], [[The_Open_Group_Architecture_Framework|TOGAF]], and others, for company-wide service design and operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240184788/Cern-uses-ITIL-to-rethink-facilities-management|title=CERN uses ITIL to rethink facilities management|website=Computerweekly.com|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2018}}

== Career ==
Shin was born in [[Ulsan]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese Korea]] in 1922. In 1941, he stowed away on a ship to Japan, where he studied chemical engineering at [[Waseda University]]. He adopted the Japanese name Takeo Shigemitsu and opened a [[rice cooker]] manufacturing plant in 1942.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After the plant was destroyed during an [[Air raids on Japan|air raid]], Shin founded [[Lotte (conglomerate)|Lotte]] in 1948, which grew from selling chewing gum to becoming a major [[multinational corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/03/03/national/media-national/anniversaries-loom-gum-producer-lotte-yoshiwara-red-light-district/|title=Anniversaries loom for gum producer Lotte and the Yoshiwara red-light district|last=Schreiber|first=Mark|date=2018-03-03|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, Shin and his family were ranked 136th on ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine's list, "[[The World's Billionaires]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/business/lists/2006/10/K7A2.html|title=#136 Shin Kyuk-Ho &amp; family|last=|first=|date=2006|website=Forbes|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Shin was ranked 38th on the magazine's list of South Korea's richest people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/83/korea-rich-09_Shin-Kyuk-Ho_K7A2.html|title=#38 Shin Kyuk-Ho|last=|first=|date=2009-04-29|website=Forbes|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lotte itself was [[South Korea]]'s fifth largest [[Chaebol|conglomerate]] as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/business/2017/08/01/27/0501000000AEN20170801007900320F.html|title=Lotte Hotel to open chain in Myanmar next month|last=|first=|date=2017-08-01|work=Yonhap News Agency|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Shin retired from his role as board director of Lotte Holdings Co. after holding the position for nearly 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-24/lotte-group-founder-shin-kyuk-ho-retires-as-board-director-at-94|title=Lotte Group Founder Shin Kyuk-ho Retires as Board Director at 94|last=Kim|first=Hooyeon|date=2017-06-24|website=Bloomberg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-15|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, he was sentenced to four years in prison after he was convicted of embezzling 128.6 billion [[South Korean won|won]] (119 million [[United States dollar|USD]]) from Lotte. However, Shin was allowed to remain free given his poor health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42451425|title=Jail for 95-year-old South Korean tycoon|last=|first=|date=2017-12-22|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Shin has a total of four children from three marriages. His first wife, Noh Soon-hwa, died in 1951.

'''SolvV''' is short for ''Solvabilitätsverordnung'' which means solvability directive in German, i.e. the [[Primary_and_secondary_legislation|delegated legislation]] of §§ 10 ff of the [[Kreditwesengesetz]] and in effect since 2006. The long name in German is ''Verordnung über die angemessene Eigenmittelausstattung von Instituten, Institutsgruppen und Finanzholding-Gruppen'', literally "directive on the appropriate setting of [[Equity (finance)|equity]] for (financial) institutes, groups of institutes and financial holding groups". There is an analogous directive with the same name in Austria.

'''St. Thomas Manor''' (1741) is a historic home and [[Catholic]] church complex located near [[Port Tobacco]], [[Charles County, Maryland]]. It is now known as '''St. Ignatius Church and Cemetery'''. The manor house complex is recognized as the oldest [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] residence in the world to have been continuously occupied by that order.  The mission settlement of Chapel Point was started in 1641 by Father [[Andrew White (missionary)|Andrew White]], S.J., an English Jesuit missionary. He administered to the [[Potapoco]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], some of whom he [[Religious conversion|converted]] to [[Catholicism]].  Established in 1662, this is the oldest continuously active [[Roman Catholic]] parish in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] of [[North America]] founded by [[Great Britain]]. With the consecration in 1794 of Bishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]], St. Thomas became the first Roman Catholic [[Episcopal see|see]] in the United States.

==Description==
The house is a two-story, seven-bay, brick structure of [[Georgian architecture]], of [[Flemish bond]] construction. The mansion is the oldest surviving example of the [[Georgian style]] in Maryland.&lt;ref name="trust"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mht.maryland.gov/secure/medusa/PDF/NR_PDFs/NR-1026.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: St. Thomas Manor |date=December 1987 |accessdate=2016-01-01 |author=J. Richard Rivoire |publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manor house was built in 1741 as the headquarters of the Maryland [[Mission (Christian)|Mission]] of the [[Society of Jesus]], replacing an earlier structure. It served as the Superior's and later the Provincial's official residence. This house was also the nucleus of other missions in [[Maryland]] and the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|mid-Atlantic region]].&lt;ref name="trust"/&gt;

Connected to the manor house stands a two-story brick wing that incorporates a former chapel built in 1798, now called [[Ignatius of Loyola|St. Ignatius]] Church. Outbuildings are also significant, including a small, mid-19th century wood-frame [[slaves]]' quarter, "one of remarkably few such buildings to survive in this area."&lt;ref name="trust"/&gt; In addition, the former corn crib is the "largest structure of its type recorded in Charles County, and one that exhibits many construction features not represented elsewhere."&lt;ref name="trust"/&gt;

[[File:Chapel Point2.jpg|thumb|Cemetery at St. Ignatius Church, Chapel Point, Charles County, MD. The Port Tobacco River flows from the right to the Potomac River at far left.]]
A [[cemetery]] lies to the west of the manor house and church. Notable parishioners are buried there, including a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] agent, [[Olivia Floyd]],&lt;ref name="trust"/&gt; and US Congressmen, [[Sydney Emanuel Mudd I|Sydney Emanuel Mudd]], [[William M Digges]], and [[Sydney Emanuel Mudd II]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OGauD2HQXrAC&amp;pg=PA388&amp;lpg=PA388&amp;dq=Obituary+for+Representative+Sydney+Emanuel+Mudd+II&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kHdtljXgQz&amp;sig=WZ0Xh9a05inKKyA4yvImE7oWkJU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VCH6UsGAFIWMyAGxpIG4Dg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Obituary%20for%20Representative%20Sydney%20Emanuel%20Mudd%20II&amp;f=false "Mudd, Sydney Emanuel "], ''Maryland Biographical Dictionary'', pp. 388-389&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Thomas Manor was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;  Due to its history and scenic waterfront setting, the manor grounds, church and cemetery attract visitors from distant places. They make up a favorite rest-stop for many bicycle tour groups.

==Additional significance==
In 1794 it was at St. Thomas Manor that [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] was invested in his robes as the first Catholic [[bishop]] of the United States of America, after the nation gained independence in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. (He later traveled to [[London]] for official [[consecration]] as a bishop by the [[Apostolic Vicariate of the London District|Vicar Apostolic]].)  This investiture established St. Thomas as the first Roman Catholic [[Episcopal see|see]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="trust"/&gt;

The St. Thomas complex was also the site of the revival of the Jesuit order in the United States in 1805, after it had been suppressed by the Catholic Church in 1773. Three American priests took their vows at St. Ignatius Church.&lt;ref name="trust"/&gt;

The Jesuits of the Maryland Province who resided at St. Thomas Manor sold several members of the [[Georgetown 272]] in [[1838 Georgetown slave sale|1838]]. In a letter, [[William McSherry]], S.J. estimated that the sale of the enslaved persons would amount to approximately $16,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://slaveryarchive.georgetown.edu/items/show/18|title=Report of Income &amp;c. of Farms of St. Thomas Manor, 1833, By McSherry · Georgetown Slavery Archive|website=slaveryarchive.georgetown.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Catholic Church and Indian records==
During the years of [[slavery]] and after the [[American Civil War]], when most southern governments classified people as only black or white in a binary system related to the racial caste of slavery, St. Ignatius was among the Catholic parishes that continued to record their Native congregational members as Indian, regardless of whether they were of [[mixed race]]. In [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial]] and United States records, by contrast, the tribal identities of some Native Americans were lost when they were classified by outsiders as [[free people of color]], "colored," or "white," regardless of how they identified ethnically.  Research in Catholic records has helped some tribes document their continuous cultural history and identification as Native American, and to gain state and federal recognition as tribes since the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Helen C.

A '''statutory employee''' is an [[independent contractor]] under American [[common law]] who is treated as an employee, by [[statute]], for purposes of [[tax withholding]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See generally [[Internal Revenue Code]] section 3121(d)(3), at {{usc|26|3121}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For a standard independent contractor, an employer cannot withhold taxes. Statutory employees are also permitted to deduct work-related expenses on [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] [[IRS tax forms|Schedule C]] instead of [[IRS tax forms|Schedule A]] in the [[Taxation in the United States|United States tax system]]. As a result, they are allowed a greater tax deduction for business expenses than standard employees, as Schedule C expenses are not subject to the 2% [[adjusted gross income]] threshold as seen with Schedule A.&lt;ref name="irs"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Statutory-Employees|title= Statutory Employees|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= IRS.gov|accessdate=Jan 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Criteria==
For an individual to be considered a statutory employee, all of the following conditions must apply:&lt;ref name="irs"/&gt;
{{Ordered list|Services must be personally performed by the individual.|The individual does not have substantial investment in the equipment and property used to perform the services.|The services are performed on a continuing basis for the same payer.}}

Some examples of persons who may be considered statutory employees are as follows:&lt;ref name="irs"/&gt;

{{Ordered list |A driver distributing non-dairy beverages, meat, vegetable, fruit, or baked goods; or who picks up laundry, if he acts as an agent or is paid by commission.|A life insurance agent whose main business is life insurance and annuity for one company.|Someone who works from home on materials an employer supplies, that must be returned and for which the employer gives work specifications.|A traveling salesperson who turns in orders from wholesalers, retailers, contractors, hotels, or restaurants, either for resale or business use. Work performed must be the principal business activity of the employee.}}

==Advantages over standard employee==
Statutory employees occupy an intermediate position between [[employees]] and [[independent contractors]] from the perspective of the employer. Statutory employees are less expensive to hire than regular employees because the employer does not have to pay unemployment taxes. However, such employees are more expensive to hire than independent contractors because [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] taxes must be paid on wages in the form of [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|FICA tax]].&lt;ref name="irs"/&gt; Statutory employees pay FICA tax through their employer, and so do not pay self-employment tax; despite this, they must report expenses, income and wage.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last = Brabec|first= Barbara|authorlink=|title=How to Maximize Schedule C Deductions &amp; Cut Self-Employment Taxes to the BONE -|publisher=Barbara Brabec Productions |date=Nov 26, 2014 |location=| pages=107|isbn= 978-0985633318|doi=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to independent contractors, statutory employees may deduct business expense from [[IRS tax forms|W-2]] earnings.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

'''The a2 Milk Company Limited'''  (previously known as '''A2 Corporation''') is an [[S&amp;P/ASX 200|ASX 200]] public listed company that commercialises intellectual property relating to [[a2 milk]], as well as the milk and related products like infant formula.

==History==
The a2 Milk Company is the successor of A2 Corporation Limited, a New Zealand company founded in 2000 by [[Corran McLachlan|Dr Corran McLachlan]], who was researching health effects of A1 beta-casein; and Howard Paterson who was one of New Zealand's richest men, a significant dairy farmer, and an important stakeholder in [[Fonterra]], a [[Agricultural cooperative|dairy cooperative]].&lt;ref name=FourCorners /&gt;&lt;ref name="A2 protein milk supply on horizon"/&gt; The company commercialised a [[genetic test]] to determine whether a [[cow]] will produce milk without the A1 protein, and to market a2 Milk.&lt;ref name=FourCorners&gt;Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 31 March 2003 [http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2003/transcripts/s820943.htm Transcript of "White Mischief"], [http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2003/20030331_white_mischief/ an episode] of ''Four Corners'', an investigative journalism series.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A2 protein milk supply on horizon"&gt;Staff, New Zealand Herald. 14 May 2001 [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=188650 A2 protein milk supply on horizon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="truswell"&gt;{{Citation |last=Truswell |first=A.S. |title=The A2 milk case: a critical review |journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=623–631 |year=2005 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602104 |pmid=15867940 |url=http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v59/n5/full/1602104a.html |accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, A2 Corporation focused on dairy farm [[breeding program]]s to develop herds that would produce only a2 milk.&lt;ref name="landline" /&gt;  However the launch of a2 milk was delayed by opposition from Fonterra, which had protected contracts under New Zealand law with about 98% of New Zealand dairy farms.&lt;ref&gt;Penny Smith for Just-food.  2 July 2003 [http://www.just-food.com/analysis/a2-milk-launched-as-controversy-churns-on_id93493.aspx A2 milk launched as controversy churns on]&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking leverage in the battle with Fonterra over access to farmers, and over patent rights,&lt;ref name=FourCorners/&gt; Paterson led the company into litigation against Fonterra, asking the New Zealand High Court to order Fonterra to put health warnings on its conventional milk concerning risks of type 1 diabetes, heart disease, autism and schizophrenia due to the presence of A1 beta-casein, and to force Fonterra to publicly disclose all the information it had about the links between A1 beta-casein and health risks.&lt;ref name=Litigation&gt;Deborah Hill Cone for Share Chat 1 November 2002 [http://www.sharechat.co.nz/article/4d8b820a/a2-accuses-dairy-giant-of-suppressing-milk-defects.html A2 accuses dairy giant of suppressing milk defects] Quote: "The lawsuit risks inflicting catastrophic damage to New Zealand's international reputation and foreign earnings as Fonterra turns over $14 billion and makes 20% of the country's total offshore receipts. As if that would not be enough of a PR disaster as the country tries to maintain its position as a clean, green food producer...."&lt;/ref&gt; The litigation threatened New Zealand's economy and international reputation as at the time Fonterra was responsible for 20% of New Zealand's exports.&lt;ref name=Litigation/&gt;  The press over the litigation and public concern over the claims of A2 Corporation led the New Zealand Food Safety Authority and the Ministry of Health and the [[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]] to issue statements confirming the safety of conventional milk.&lt;ref name=FourCorners/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2003/20030331_white_mischief/statement.pdf Supporting documents for "White Mischief" story]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Minister&gt;Office of the Minister of Food Safety, New Zealand Food Safety Authority. 27 November 2007 [http://www.foodsafety.govt.nz/elibrary/industry/Milk_Arrangements-Advises_Cabinet.pdf A1-A2 Milk: Arrangements for Upcoming Reviews] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821101932/http://www.foodsafety.govt.nz/elibrary/industry/Milk_Arrangements-Advises_Cabinet.pdf |date=21 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A2 Corporation was able to obtain agreements with enough dairy farmers to launch A2 milk in New Zealand at the end of April 2003.&lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Stock Exchange. [https://www.nzx.com/markets/NZSX/securities/ATM/analysis a2 Milk Company Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of 2003, both founders of the company died.  In July, Paterson was found dead in his hotel room during a business trip at the age of 50,&lt;ref&gt;Staff, ''New Zealand Herald''. 5 July 2003 [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3510994 Obituary: Howard Paterson]&lt;/ref&gt; and a month later [[Corran McLachlan|Dr Corran McLachlan]] died of cancer at the age of 59.&lt;ref name=AR2003/&gt;  In New Zealand it is illegal to make health claims about a food product without providing scientific evidence and registering the food as a medicine, and in November 2003 the New Zealand [[Commerce Commission]] advised that A2 Corporation Ltd and its licensed A2 producers had agreed to amend the health claims in their promotional material following a warning from the commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodsafety.govt.nz/elibrary/industry/Food_Safety-Nzfsa_Been.pdf Stuart A.

The company, which had been in a tenuous financial situation since beginning trading in May, went into [[Administration (law)|administration]] in October&lt;ref name=liquidates/&gt; and was [[Liquidation|liquidated]] in November, owing farmers and processors tens of thousands of dollars.&lt;ref name="landline"/&gt;&lt;ref name=liquidates&gt;Shelley Lloyd for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 17 November 2004 [http://www.abc.net.au/site-archive/rural/qld/stories/s1245678.htm A2 milk liquidates]&lt;/ref&gt; A $1.27 million federal government grant awarded to the company in August as part of the Regional Partnerships Program was also cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Finance_and_Public_Administration/Completed%20inquiries/2004-07/reg_partner_prog/index Australian Senate finance and public administration references committee report on Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programs, October 2005, pages xiv, 97–100]&lt;/ref&gt; A2 Corporation set up a new subsidiary and licensee, A2 Australia, to market and produce its product. A2 Australia established new contracts with the dairy farmers who had A2 herds, promising better payment terms—a week in advance instead of once per month, after shipment.&lt;ref name="landline" /&gt;

In December, A2 Corporation sold its interests in A2 Australia to [[Fraser &amp; Neave]], a [[food marketing]] giant in Asian markets, for about $1.1 million.  A2 Corporation had lost about $1.3 million for 2004, the same as it has lost the year before; the sale allowed A2 Corporation to rely on Fraser &amp; Neave to build the Australian and Asian businesses.&lt;ref name=QuickSale&gt;Ellen Read for the New Zealand Herald. 30 December 2004 [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=9004964 Quick sale likely for A2 Corp]&lt;/ref&gt; A2 Corporation focused on recovering from the deaths of its founders organizationally and financially, relied on its New Zealand licensees to develop the New Zealand market, and turned its focus to developing overseas markets.&lt;ref name=QuickSale/&gt;

Between 2004 and 2006, A2 Corporation business continued to grow. [[Dairy Australia]], the national association of the Australian dairy industry, and market competitors like [[Parmalat]] in response have consistently stated that there is no conclusive scientific evidence to suggest A1 proteins are dangerous and have warned that criticism of normal milk is damaging the entire dairy industry.&lt;ref name="landline"&gt;{{cite web |last=Courtney |first=Pip | author-link = Pip Courtney |title=The A2 milk story |work=Landline |publisher=ABC Television |date=6 August 2006 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2006/s1702999.htm |accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hunt |first=Peter |title=A2 attacks milk |newspaper=The Weekly Times |location=Melbourne |page=3 |date=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Smith |first=Simone |title=It's a matter of genetics |newspaper=The Weekly Times |location=Melbourne |page=107 |date=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rival"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hawthorne |first=Mark |title=Rival watering down A2 Milk claims |newspaper=The Age |location=Melbourne |pages=8, 28–29 |date=24 May 2014 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/rival-seeks-to-water-down-a2-milk-claims-20140523-38uef.html |accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Binsted |first=Tim |title=Parmalat boss hits out at A2 |newspaper=Australian Financial Review |page=8 |date=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reconsolidation and succession as The a2 Milk Company ===

In 2006, A2 Corporation was on sound enough footing to buy back A2 Australia from Fraser &amp; Neave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10376408| title=A2 set to buy back Australian unit| date=6 April 2006| publisher=NZ Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, it lost about $1 million, after having lost $9 million the year before, but revenues had approximately doubled.  In that year it warned shareholders not to expect profit for another three years.&lt;ref name="landline"/&gt;

Commercial development proceeded, and by 2010 some 40 million litres of a2 Milk were being produced by 12,000 A2-certified cows across Australia, with milk processed at four plants in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland,&lt;ref name="simonegenetics"&gt;{{Citation |last=Smith |first=Simone |title=It's a matter of genetics |newspaper=Weekly Times |location=Melbourne |page=107 |date=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yoghurt made with a2 Milk went on the market in Australia in April 2010.&lt;ref name=Formula&gt;{{cite news |last=Adams |first=Christopher |title=A2 gets ready to launch baby formula |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |location=Auckland |date=10 September 2013 |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11121927 |accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011 A2 Corporation announced it had a made a profit over a half-year for the first time; in the six months ending 31 December 2010, it made a net $894,000, or 17 cents/share.&lt;ref&gt;A2 Corporation Press Release 18 February 2011 [http://aboutthea2milkcompany.com/a2-corp-declares-a-maiden-profit/ A2 Corp Declares a Maiden Profit] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120543/http://aboutthea2milkcompany.com/a2-corp-declares-a-maiden-profit/ |date=26 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012 A2 Corporation announced it would attempt to raise $20 million and list on the New Zealand Stock Exchange main board,&lt;ref&gt;Georgina Bond for the National Business Review. 5 December 2012 [http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/a2-corp-sets-sights-nzx-20-million-equity-raising-gb-133540 A2 Corp sets sights on NZX with $20 million equity raising]&lt;/ref&gt; and that it would use the funds to grow its Chinese infant formula and UK milk businesses.  It listed in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, The Headliner. 7 March 2013. [http://www.headliner.co.nz/news/11412.html A2 Corporation to Step Up]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a2 Milk whole milk powder and a2 Milk Ice Cream products were launched.&lt;ref name="2015pres"&gt;{{cite web |title=FY Results Presentation 2015 |url=https://www.thea2milkcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/FY-Results-Presentation-2015.pdf |website=The a2 Milk Company |date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2014–2015 Financial year, The a2 Milk Company reported its Australian and New Zealand segment revenue grew by 40% vs pcp; and sales on a2 infant formula increased by 650%.&lt;ref name="2015pres"/&gt;

In December 2017 the company announced that in the summer of 2018 Geoffrey Babidge, who had been nearing retirement age, would step down and [[Jayne Hrdlicka]] would take over as CEO; at that time she was CEO of [[Jetstar Airways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Zealand's A2 Milk names Jayne Hrdlicka as CEO |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/a2-milk-company-ceo/new-zealands-a2-milk-names-jayne-hrdlicka-as-ceo-idUSL4N1OD095 |work=Reuters |date=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took over in July 2018.  At that time the company was experiencing strong growth via sales in China and had ramped up spending to further increase Chinese sales and to expand the US market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A2 Milk outlook shows Jayne Hrdlicka has two big tasks |url=https://www.afr.com/brand/chanticleer/a2-milk-outlook-shows-jayne-hrdlicka-has-two-big-tasks-20180712-h12kqn |work=Financial Review |date=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Please do not add new content here.  Please add it to the body of [[A2 milk]] and if it rises to the [[WP:LEAD]] of that article, update the lead, then copy that here. Per [[WP:SYNC]] --&gt;
a2 claims that milk containing A1 proteins are harmful, but a 2009 [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) review of scientific literature found there was insufficient evidence to prove that bioactive peptides in A1 milk have a negative effect on health.&lt;ref name=EFSA&gt;{{cite journal |author1=European Food Safety Authority |title=Review of the potential health impact of β-casomorphins and related peptides |journal=EFSA Journal |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=231r |date=3 February 2009 |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2009.231r |url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/231r}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[casein|A1 and A2 beta-casein]] are [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|genetic variants]] of the beta-casein milk protein that differ by one [[amino acid]]. The A1 beta-casein type is the most common type found in cow's milk in Europe (excluding France), the USA, Australia and New Zealand. A genetic test, developed by the A2 Milk Company, determines whether a cow produces the A2 or A1 type protein in its milk. The test allows the a2 Milk Company to license milk producers once proven their cows produce only A2 beta-casein protein in their milk, to the exclusion of the A1 beta-casein protein type.&lt;ref name=EFSA/&gt;

==Intellectual property==
A2 Corporation licensed patents filed in the 1990s by the New Zealand Dairy Board, and filed its own patents on [[genetic tests]] to determine what form of beta-casein cows produce in milk, and concerning potential adverse health consequences of A1 milk.&lt;ref name=FourCorners/&gt;&lt;ref name="truswell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/EP0789842A1?cl=zh EP0789842A1 Google patents]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Stevenson for the New Zealand Herald. 21 December 2000 [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=165973 A2 Corp pays $8m for milk patent rights]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2012 A2 Corporation had developed a worldwide suite of intellectual property, including trademarks, trade secrets, and patents covering products, the genetic test and methods to develop A2 producing herds, as well as methods to check the protein content and fatty acid content of milk, [[dietary supplements]] with A2 beta-casein, and even therapeutic uses of A2.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Babidge, Managing Director &amp; CEO of A2 Corp. April 2012 [http://aboutthea2milkcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/a2C-presentation-Apr-121.pdf A2 Corporation Presentation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The a2 Milk Company continues to develop a portfolio of intellectual property, including trademarks and patents. The a2 Milk Company also invests in targeted research and development associated with the benefits of the A2 protein.&lt;ref name="2015pres"/&gt; In September 2017, It was reported that A2 Milk got approval to keep selling its products in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/a2-milk-gets-china-tick-of-approval-20170928-gyqe3k.html|title=A2 Milk gets China tick of approval|last=Gray|first=Darren|date=2017-09-28|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Markets ==

===Australia and New Zealand===

Sales of a2 Milk in Australia and New Zealand boosted significantly following 2007, after the publication of a book, ''Devil in the Milk'' by Keith Woodford, about A1 beta-casein and its perceived dangers to health&lt;ref&gt;A2 Corporation Press Release, November 2007.

A2 Corporation changed its name to The a2 Milk Company Limited effective April 2014, and at that time had about 8% market share of the milk products market in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Press Release, A2 Corporation. 31 March 2014 [http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1403/S00975/a2-changes-name.htm A2 changes name]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NZHlion/&gt;

===United States===
In August 2003, The a2 Milk Company exclusively licensed patent and trademark rights to US-based Ideasphere Incorporated (ISI) to market a2 Milk products in North America.&lt;ref&gt;A2 Corporation [https://www.nzx.com/files/documents/companies/ATM/21_Annual_Report_2004.pdf A2 Corporation 2004 Annual Report]&lt;/ref&gt;  ISI acquired [[Twinlab]] in September 2003, followed by another string of acquisitions in the [[dietary supplement]] market.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, Engredea. 3 July 2005 [http://newhope360.com/supply-news-amp-analysis/ideasphere-intends-acquire-non-ephedra-metabolife-assets Ideasphere Intends to Acquire Non-Ephedra Metabolife Assets]&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2005, ISI and A2 Corporation agreed to form a joint venture, a2 Milk Company LLC.&lt;ref&gt;A2 Corporation [https://www.nzx.com/files/documents/companies/ATM/11_Interim_Report_2005.pdf A2 Corporation Half-Yearly Report for the half-year ending September 2005] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210205746/https://www.nzx.com/files/documents/companies/ATM/11_Interim_Report_2005.pdf |date=10 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007 A2 Corporation announced a deal in which the joint venture would license rights to the Original Foods Company, whose branding the a2 Milk product would carry, and in which the product would be sold in several [[Midwestern United States|midwestern states]] through the [[Hy-Vee]] supermarket chain.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Burgess for the New Zealand Herald. 25 April 2007 [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10435998 A2 to tap into US milk market]&lt;/ref&gt;

In A2 Corporation's 2009 Annual Report, the company announced that the joint venture had regained all rights to the US market through a settlement with the Original Foods Company, and that "The US dairy milk market remains intensely competitive and continues to be a major challenge."&lt;ref&gt;A2 Corporation [https://www.nzx.com/files/documents/companies/ATM/12_Annual_Report_2009.pdf A2 Corporation Annual Report 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010 The a2 Milk Company bought out all but less than 1% of ISI's share in the joint venture.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Baldwin for National Business Review. 5 October 2010 [http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/a2-corporation-takes-full-control-us-marketing-arm-131022 A2 Corporation takes full control of US marketing arm]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colonel (British Army)|Colonel]] '''Thomas Moody''' (1779–1849), {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|ADC|JP|}}, [[Order of Military Merit (France)|Knight of the Order of Military Merit of France]], was a British [[Colonial Office|Aide-de-camp to the Colonial Office]], [[Royal Engineer]], and merchant. He served as the Commander of the [[Royal Engineers]] in the [[West Indies]], as the Director of several trading companies in the [[City of London]], and as an Advisor to the [[East India Company]].

Moody was [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliamentary Commissioner]] into the conditions of African slaves in the [[West Indies]], as which he engaged in a feud with [[Thomas Babington Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]]. Moody's ultimate conclusion was that the indentured [[Africans]] in the West Indies should be taken back to West Africa.

In 1828, Moody and his friend [[James Stirling (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Stirling]] offered to [[Australia|colonise Australia]] using their own capital, but were prohibited from doing so by the British Government.

He was the father of [[Richard Clement Moody|Major-General Richard Clement Moody]], the founder of [[British Columbia]] and first British [[Governor of the Falkland Islands]], and [[Hampden Clement Blamire Moody|Colonel Hampden Clement Blamire Moody CB, the Commander of the Royal Engineers in China]], amongst others.

==Family and early life==
Thomas was born into a family with an extensive history of military service to the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; He was the third son of Thomas Moody (1732–1796)&lt;ref name="royalengineers.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalengineers.ca/Moody.html|title=The Royal Engineers: Colonel Richard Clement Moody|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Blakey Smith, ed., 'The Journal of Arthur Thomas Bushby, 1858–1859,' British Columbia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalengineers.ca/SapperJune1958.html|title=The Sapper Vol. 5 No. 1 June 1958|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Barbara Blamire (1740–1806),&lt;ref name="longtown19.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longtown19.co.uk/some_longtown_families.84.html|title=The Moody Family, Some Longtown Families|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was a member of the Blamire family of [[Cumberland]] and a cousin of [[William Blamire|William Blamire MP, High Sheriff of Cumberland]], and a cousin of the poet [[Susanna Blamire]].&lt;ref name="longtown19.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Will of Major Thomas Moody, UCL"/&gt; He was born in [[Longtown, Cumbria]].&lt;ref name="Will of Major Thomas Moody, UCL"/&gt; His eldest brother, Charles, was a merchant in the [[West Indies]], and his other brother, George, was a surgeon.

===Character and society===
In character, Moody was obsessed with social hierarchy, discipline, and surveillance:&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; with what he termed 'the bonds of respect and subordination'.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

Moody was a [[Freemason]] and was described by [[Humphrey Fleming Senhouse|Sir Humphrey Fleming Senhouse]] as 'an Officer of high character and reputation'.&lt;ref name="Railway Meeting"/&gt;
Moody was incorporated in diverse factions of the London establishment.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; Inside the Colonial Office, Moody had 'all its archives open to him'.&lt;ref name="Pardue"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pardue|first=Jeffrey David|title=Agent of Imperial Change: James Macqueen and the British Empire, 1778-1870|year=1996|publisher=University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[City of London]], Moody was an Advisor to the [[East India Company]]; a Director of the Crown Life Assurance Company, of [[Blackfriars, London|33 Bridge Street, Blackfriars]];&lt;ref name="Kalendar"/&gt; and a Director of the [[New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Land Company]], of 5 Coptball Court, London.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=19706|page=269|date=12 February 1839}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He was a member of the [[Political Economy Club]], at which he disputed with both [[James Mill]] and [[John Ramsay McCulloch]], and at which he admired the philosophy of [[Jean-Baptiste Say]].&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; Moody’s other friends included [[Robert Wilmot-Horton|Sir Robert Wilmot Horton]], with whom he had an extensive private correspondence,&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; and after
whom he named one of his sons;&lt;ref name="Will of Major Thomas Moody, UCL"/&gt; [[Shute Barrington|Shute Barrington, Bishop of Durham]], after whom he named another of his sons;&lt;ref name="Shute Barrington correspondence"&gt;{{cite web|title=Correspondence with Major Moody, of Barrington, Shute (1734 - 1826), Bishop of Durham|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/N13994364}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Leith (British Army officer)|Sir James Leith]], after whom he named another of his sons;&lt;ref name="DFB James Leith Moody"/&gt; [[Humphrey Fleming Senhouse|Sir Humphrey Fleming Senhouse]];&lt;ref name="Railway Meeting"/&gt; [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]];&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; [[James Macqueen]];&lt;ref name="Pardue"/&gt; [[James Mangles (Royal Navy officer)|James Mangles]];&lt;ref name="Ambition's Fire"/&gt; [[Thomas Hyde Villiers]];&lt;ref name="Lamont"/&gt; and [[James Stirling (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Stirling]].&lt;ref name="Wakefield"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stirling letter"/&gt;

Moody was a [[polymath]] who read in several languages, and in diverse subjects, including philosophy, climatology, sociology, economics, history, and physics.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; His reading included the works of [[Montesquieu]]; [[William Petty]]; [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]]; [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] (whom he knew personally, and of whom he was a fervent admirer);&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt;[[Johannes van den Bosch]]; and those of the [[Africans]] [[Toussaint Louverture]] and [[Henri Christophe]].&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; He was also influenced by the [[Africa]]n [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]], the [[President of Haiti]].&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; He disputed the economic philosophy of [[James Mill]], that of [[John Ramsay McCulloch]], and that of [[Adam Smith]], and admired the philosophy of [[Jean-Baptiste Say]].&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt;
Moody was also extensively read in abolitionist literature.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt;

==West Indies==
===Aide-de-camp (1797 - 1821)===
Moody arrived in Barbados in 1797,&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt; to serve as mathematics master,&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rupprecht|first1=Anita|last2= |first2= |date=September 2012|title='When he gets among his countrymen,they tell him that he is free': Slave Trade Abolition, Indentured Africans and a Royal Commission|journal=Slavery &amp; Abolition|volume=33 |issue=3 |pages= 435–455|doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt; writing master,&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt; and Assistant Headmaster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codrington.org/site/index.php/important-dates|title=Codrington College, Barbados: Important Dates}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Codrington College]], at which he served until 1805.&lt;ref name="Parry"&gt;{{cite book|title=Codrington College in the Island of Barbados|author=Thomas Parry, Bishop of Barbados|publisher=Society for the Propagation of the Gospel|year=1847|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these positions, Moody demonstrated such an aptitude for mathematics that [[Francis Mackenzie, 1st Baron Seaforth|Lord Seaforth]], the [[List of Governors of Barbados|British General in Barbados]], granted Moody his patronage,&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt; and procured for Moody a direct commission in the [[Royal Engineers]],&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Barbados|author=Schomburgk, Sir Robert H.|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans|year=1848}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Moody entered as a Lieutenant on 1 July 1806.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal Military Calendar"/&gt; Moody's first duty was to administer the Office of Ordinance in [[Demerara]],&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; and he proceeded, subsequently, to distinguish himself in the Napoleonic Wars.&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt; Moody was promoted to Second Captain on 1 May 1811; to Captain on 20 December 1814; and to Brevet Major on 23 May 1816.&lt;ref name="Royal Military Calendar"/&gt; [[File:LordSeaforthByThomas Lawrence.jpg|thumb|upright|Moody was recruited into the [[Royal Engineers]] by [[Francis Mackenzie, 1st Baron Seaforth|Lord Seaforth]]]]

Moody served as [[aide-de-camp]] to [[James Leith (British Army officer)|Sir James Leith]],&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leith Memoirs"&gt;{{cite book|title=Appendix to Memoirs of the Late Lieutenant-General Sir James Leith GCB|author=Leith Hay, Sir Andrew|publisher=William Stockdale|year=1818|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was [[Governor of Barbados]] from May 1815 to October 1816,&lt;ref name="Leith Memoirs"/&gt; and Superintendent of the Crown Plantations in [[Guadeloupe]].&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Moody named his son [[James Leith Moody]] after Leith, of whom he was a fervent admirer.&lt;ref name="DFB James Leith Moody"/&gt; During his service as aide-de-camp to Leith, Thomas Moody was involved in the successful [[Invasion of Guadeloupe (1815)]], for which he was subsequently knighted, in 1820, by [[Louis XVIII]], in the [[Order of Military Merit (France)|Order of Military Merit]].&lt;ref name="Bulletins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hart's Annual Army List, 1844"/&gt; Moody also served as aide-de-camp to both the President of Tortola; and to [[Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere]], who was Governor of Barbados from 1817 to 1820, after whom Moody named one of his sons.&lt;ref name="Royal Military Calendar"&gt;{{cite book | last =| first = | title = The Royal Military Calendar or Army Service and Commission Book, Third Edition, Vol. V, 1820 | page=333|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title =Slave Trade.

In 1816, Moody was responsible for the transfer of groups of rescued Africans to the Crown estates in [[Guadeloupe]]. Moody believed that rescued Africans made an 'extremely useful' contribution to the British Empire.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; His competent performance in this appointment may have contributed to his subsequent appointment as a Parliamentary Commissioner on Slavery.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

===Estates===
Moody owned plantations in Barbados by 1816, but he supported the Barbados Slave Rebellions of September and October 1816, which he witnessed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fliphtml5.com/ngat/kjqo|title=Letter of Thomas Moody to H.

===French knighthood (1820)===
In 1820, Moody was knighted by [[Louis XVIII]] in the [[Order of Military Merit (France)|Order of Military Merit]] for defending the French colony of [[Guadeloupe]]. He was permitted by [[George IV]] to wear the Cross of the Order whilst in Britain, but not to use the title 'Sir'.&lt;ref name="Bulletins"&gt;{{cite book | last =| first = | title = Bulletins and Other State Intelligence Compiled and Arranged from the Official Documents published in the London Gazette, 1820| page=220 |publisher=R.

===The Parliamentary Commission on Slavery (1821 - 1828)===
In 1821, [[William Wilberforce]] proposed to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] the creation a Commission to investigate the condition of slaves in the West Indies due to omnipresent reports that the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]], which had made the trade of slaves illegal, was being universally violated by wealthy plantation owners, who were redesignating their slaves as 'apprentices' and continuing to trade.&lt;ref name="Papers Relating to Slaves in the Colonies"&gt;{{cite book |title = Slave Trade.

Moody and John Dougan (1765-1826) volunteered for each of the commissionerships and were selected by Bathurst.&lt;ref Name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Moody was a friend of the President of Tortola, the island on which the commissioners were to commence their investigations.&lt;ref Name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

Dougan was the son of an owner of sugar plantations on Demerara: Dougan stated, 'all my nearest relations and friends were either Planters or Owners of slaves'.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Dougan had lived on Tortola, where he worked as a merchant, privateer, Prize Agent for the Royal Navy, and Colonial administrator.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Dougan was the uncle of Moody's wife,&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Martha Clement,&lt;ref name= "Legacies of British Slave Ownership, UCL"/&gt; and the son of a slave-plantation owner.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

Dougan was influenced by the zealous idealism of [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] agitators in England, such as the [[Quaker]] [[John Barton (Quaker)|John Barton]],&lt;ref name="Papers Relating to Slaves in the Colonies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinsman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Slave Trade.

Moody and Dougan arrived on Tortola in May 1822.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Moody objected to the interview process recommended by the Commission, in which masters and apprentices were supposed to be interviewed together, because he thought that it were 'calculated to excite complaints of the servant against the master'.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Among the ex-slaverowners interviewed by Moody was Abraham Mendes Belisario, the Deputy Provost Marshal of Tortola, who possessed 17 African apprentices.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; As a consequence of the unreliability of the reports of apprentices that such masters provided, which were known as 'Characters' of apprentices, Moody insisted that such reports should not be heard, nor quoted in the official Commission report, but that he and Dougan, the Commissioners, should specify only their own opinions of the masters of the apprentices.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

The Commissioners recorded that many black African apprentices were employed by free black [[Africans]].&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; When ‘apprentices’ employed by H. C. Maclean, a prosperous merchant who served as Comptroller of the Customs on Tortola, complained to the Commission, Macclean had them beaten. Moody refused to criticise Macclean: Dougan objected to Moody's refusal, but received no sympathy amongst the Colonial administration of the islands. This event provoked a spiteful feud between Dougan and Moody: Dougan complained about the 'state of Irritation and Disunion of the Commission'.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Dougan attempted to reconcile himself with Moody, but Moody refused to forgive him, and, as a consequence, Dougan was compelled to resign from the Commission,&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; in June 1822, to return to England, and to submit his report to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in private.&lt;ref name="Kinsman" /&gt; In this report, dated 20 December 1823, Dougan contends that "free labour in the West Indies is preferable to compulsory labour".&lt;ref name="Papers Relating to Slaves in the Colonies"/&gt; On his resignation, Dougan stated that '[the] repeated attacks, the State of Irritation of Major Moody's Mind, and all hopes of Conciliation [were] ended': however, their 'protracted and unpleasant dispute' continued even after the death of Dougan,&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; in 1826, subsequent to which his efforts for reform were continued by his daughter, Mary,&lt;ref name="Kinsman"/&gt; between whom and Moody the feud continued.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

In 1824, Moody's friend [[Robert Wilmot-Horton|Sir Robert Wilmot Horton]], forwarded one of Moody's papers to [[George Canning]], then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; Subsequently, in 1825, Moody returned to London and presented to the House of Commons an exposition of the reasons for his refusal to sign the report prepared by Dougan in Tortola, in addition to the official Commission report,&lt;ref name="Commission Report of Thomas Moody"/&gt; which he had completed on his own, without Dougan,&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; and which he submitted without the consent of Dougan,&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; that is dated 2 March 1825,&lt;ref name="Commission Report of Thomas Moody"/&gt; and consists of over 200 pages.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Moody's official Commission report contends that "without some species of coercion African labour would be worthless".&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Commission Report of Thomas Moody"&gt;{{cite book | last = | first = | title =Parliamentary Abstracts, Containing the Substance of all Important Papers laid before the two Houses of Parliament during the Session of 1825| page=239|publisher=Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green, 1826|ISBN=0646417215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Whig [[Thomas Babington Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]] described Moody's report as 'in substance, a defence of West Indian slavery', but Moody described his theories as a 'Philosophy of Labour',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Macaulay | first =Thomas Babington | title =Social and Industrial Capacities of the Negroes (Edinburgh Review, March 1827), collected in Critical, Historical and Miscellaneous Essays, Volume 6 (1860),| pages=361–404|publisher=New York, Sheldon and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; and himself as a 'practical philanthropist'.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Lord Macaulay's description is inaccurate because, although Moody desired the employment of Africans, Moody did not desire their employment under conditions of enslavement:&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; indeed, Moody had supported the Barbados Slave Rebellions of September and October 1816, despite owning plantations in Barbados.&lt;ref name="Empowering Impulse"/&gt; 
Moody was influenced by the theory of the climatological determination of the human constitution that was advocated by [[Montesquieu]], and contended that it were a 'physical fact' that only blacks possessed the ability to perform agricultural labour in the 'torrid zone'.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; Moody was also extensively read in abolitionist literature.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt;

Moody's ultimate conclusion was that the indentured [[Africans]] in the West Indies should be taken back to West Africa.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

Moody submitted a second report, also of over 200 pages, in 1826.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Moody's philosophy also analysed [[Netherlands|Dutch]] agricultural colonies, the [[Bengal]] peasantry, slavery in [[India]], prostitution in [[Sierra Leone]], slavery in the [[United States]], and the American Colonization Society for African-American settlement in West Africa.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt;

Moody's philosophy, which incorporated innumerable scholarly references,&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; won the advocacy of the director of the Commission, [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst|Lord Bathurst]], and of his Under-Secretary, [[Robert Wilmot-Horton|Sir Robert Wilmot Horton]],&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; with whom Moody had an extensive private correspondence;&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; of the [[Tories]]; and of the advocates of Britain's

R. | title = Ambitions Fire: Agricultural Colonization of Pre-Convict Western Australia | page=38 |ISBN = 0855641967}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Moody's report provoked the Whigs, evangelicals, and abolitionists to ire.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; [[Zachary Macaulay]] and other abolitionists condemned Moody's philosophy in the [[Anti-Slavery Reporter]],&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Legacies of British Slave Ownership, UCL"/&gt; and Lord Macaulay cited Moody's reports in an anti-slavery essay that was published in the [[Edinburgh Review]] in
in 1827.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Moody's contentions and his style of expression were condemned by Lord Macaulay,&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Babington Macaulay]], ''Social and Industrial Capacities of the Negroes'' ([[Edinburgh]] Review, March 1827), collected in ''Critical, Historical and Miscellaneous Essays, Volume 6'' (1860), pp.361–404.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a series of anonymous letters to the [[Morning Chronicle]] newspaper, all which provoked extensive defensive refutations from Moody.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Throughout the period in which London political society responded to his reports, Moody maintained a continuous dialogue with the Colonial Office, in which he vigorously refuted the criticisms of his reports, and repudiated the doctrines of his critics in private correspondences and in the newspapers.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; Moody's friends Sir Robert Wilmot Horton and [[Thomas Hyde Villiers|Thomas Hyde Villiers MP]] also wrote articles - under the pseudonym 'Vindex', which Moody had also used - to the Star newspaper, in which they refuted the objections that others had made to Moody's philosophy and defended Moody.&lt;ref name="Lamont"/&gt; Moody proceeded to testify before the Privy Council, on the matter, in 1828.&lt;ref name="Lamont"/&gt; Moody's report influenced Lord Bathurst, [[Henry Taylor (dramatist)|Sir Henry Taylor]], and [[James Stephen (civil servant)|James Stephen]].&lt;ref name="Lamont"/&gt;

Dougan was infuriated when he discovered that Moody had submitted the report without his consent, and began to compose a response, but he died, destitute,&lt;ref name="Kinsman"/&gt; in September 1826, before he had completed his response.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Dougan's response was completed after his death by his daughter, Mary,&lt;ref name="Kinsman"/&gt; but it was intercepted by Moody, who annotated it extensively with refutations, before it reached Bathurst.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; A feud between Moody and Mary Dougan continued after the death of John Dougan.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

For their efforts, Dougan and Moody were each made a [[Justice of the Peace]].&lt;ref name="Papers Relating to Slaves in the Colonies"/&gt;

===Moody's offer to colonise Australia (1828)===
When the British Government abandoned plans to implement the plans of [[James Stirling (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Stirling]] to settle the [[Swan River Colony]], Stirling and Moody, in August 1828, offered form an association of private capitalists that would settle Australia, using their own capital, observing the 'principles' that had been observed by [[William Penn]] in the settlement of [[Pennsylvania]], but this proposal was rejected by the government.&lt;ref name="Wakefield"&gt;{{cite book |title = The Colonization of Australia (1829–42): The Wakefield Experiment in Empire Building| last = Mills | first = Richard Charles |chapter= III, p. 45 | publisher= Sidgwick and Jackson, 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Stirling letter"&gt;{{citation | chapter = Letter by Captain Stirling and Major Moody to Under Secretary Hay. 21st August, 1828, in Official Papers relating to the Settlement at Swan River, West Australia, December 1826 – January 1830 | title= [[Historical Records of Australia]] | series= Series III | volume= Volume VI |pages= 551–640}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Indian Service, 1828 -  1837===
Moody’s residential office at the Colonial Office was abolished in 1828.&lt;ref name="Pardue"/&gt; His departure from this office was a consequence of his 'unpopularity with the saints'.&lt;ref name="Pardue"/&gt; Moody returned to the West Indies in 1828, to perform special service in the Dutch Colonies for Sir Robert Wilmot Horton, which he completed in 1829.&lt;ref name="Lamont"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/30676/1/SP%20Lamont%20thesis%20-%20electronic%20version.pdf|title=Robert Wilmot Horton and Liberal Toryism|author=Lamont, Stephen Peter|publisher=University of Nottingham|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period in which he were in the West Indies, Moody rose from the rank of Major to that of [[Colonel (British Army)|Colonel]] in the Royal Engineers.&lt;ref name="royalengineers.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=20660|supp=y|page=3993|date=10 November 1846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=5715 Richard Clement Moody]" in ''[[Dictionary of Canadian Biography]] Online''(2002)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Moody served as Commander of the Royal Engineers in the [[West Indies]] from 1829 to 1837:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nautical Magazine and Naval Chronicle: a Journal of Papers on Subjects Connected with Maritime Affairs|volume= 1844|page= 773 | publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was made a Lieutenant-Colonel in 1830&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt; and had been promoted to Colonel by 1847.&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt;

==Later life (1837 - 1849)==
The British Government considered Moody to be a highly competent civil engineer and consulted him in regard of several important projects, such as the [[Caledonian Railway]], the West Cumberland Railway, and the  [[Furness Railway]], and the embankments at Morecambe Bay and at Duddon Sands. For his civil engineering, Moody received a DCL degree from the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Railway Meeting"&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the Proceedings of the Caledonian, West Cumberland, and Furness Railway Meeting held at Whitehaven on 10 April 1838|publisher=J. Robinson, Lowthorpe Street, 1838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government appointed Moody as the director of two major government manufactories, [[Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills|one making gunpowder]] and the other making small arms, at [[Waltham Abbey (town)|Waltham Abbey]].&lt;ref name="Railway Meeting"/&gt;

Thomas was posted, by the Colonial Office, to [[Guernsey]] in 1846.&lt;ref name="DFB Richard Clement Moody"/&gt;

Thomas Moody's London residences were [[Bedford Square|7 Alfred Place, Bedford Square]], and [[Mayfair|23 Bolton Street, Mayfair]]. He died on 5 September 1849 at Berrywood House, near [[Southampton]].&lt;ref name="Will of Major Thomas Moody, UCL"/&gt; In 1852, an advertisement appeared in [[The Times]] (02/06/1852 p.&amp;nbsp;1.) for unclaimed stock of the value of £120 that had been the property of 'Lieutenant-Colonel [sic] Thomas Moody, of Waltham Abbey', and the dividends of which had been unclaimed since 1839.&lt;ref name="Legacies of British Slave Ownership, UCL" /&gt;

===Reputation at Colonial Office===
It is likely that the illustrious reputation, at the Colonial Office, that Thomas had acquired, contributed to the Office's decision to appoint his son, [[Richard Clement Moody]], to the position of [[Governor of the Falkland Islands|Lieutenant-Governor of the Falkland Islands]] when Richard Clement Moody was only the unprecedentedly young age of 28 years.&lt;ref name="DFB Richard Clement Moody"/&gt; Thomas's reputation may also have contributed to the appointment of Richard Clement Moody as the first [[Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia]], by [[Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=5715|title= Entry for Richard Clement Moody in Dictionary of Canadian Biography|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and issue==
On 1 January 1809, Thomas married Martha Clement (1764–1868), who was the daughter of Richard Clement (1754–1829), a Dutch landowner of Barbados,&lt;ref name="DFB Richard Clement Moody"&gt;{{cite web|title=Entry for Moody, Richard Clement, in Dictionary of Falklands Biography|url=https://www.falklandsbiographies.org/biographies/moody_richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the niece of John Dougan (1765-1826).&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Thomas's father in law, Richard Clement, after whom Thomas named his son [[Richard Clement Moody]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legacies of British Slave Ownership: Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Moody: Imperial Legacy Details|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/imperial/view/1837776487}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the owner of the Black Bess (196 slaves) and Clement Castle (220 slaves) estates on St Peter's Island, which passed to Clement's sole remaining son, Hampden Clement, on his death.&lt;ref&gt;Will of Richard Clement of Barbados, PROB 11/1811/204, University College, London&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas and Martha had 10 children, 8 of whom were living at the time of their father's death.&lt;ref name="Will of Major Thomas Moody, UCL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/6650|title=The Will of Major Thomas Moody, PROB 11/2101, Codicil of 09/01/1843; The Carlisle Patriot 22/09/1849, accessed via Legacies of British Slave-Ownership: Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Moody: Profile and Legacies Summary|publisher=University College London|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Val de Seine''' is one of the most important [[central business district|business districts]] of the [[Demographics of Paris#Paris agglomeration|Paris agglomeration]]. Located southwest of the city, it spreads along a bend of the [[Seine]], mainly in the municipalities
of [[Boulogne-Billancourt]] and [[Issy-les-Moulineaux]] and in the [[15th arrondissement of Paris]].

The district, dominated by industry during most of the 20th century, has specialized since the 1980s in communication activities and today it is the most important business district of the Paris agglomeration in that field. The Val de Seine contains the headquarters of most major French TV networks, including [[TF1]], [[France Télévisions]], [[Arte]], [[Canal+]], [[Télévision Par Satellite|TPS]], [[Eurosport]] and [[France 24]].

==Early life and education==

Born into a [[Jewish]] family&lt;ref name=wired-mag&gt;[https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/10/mf_milner/all/ Wired Magazine: "How Russian Tycoon Yuri Milner Bought His Way Into Silicon Valley" By Michael Wolff] 21 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mousumi Saha Kumar|title=Self-Made Billionaire Investor Yuri Milner Sets $3 Million Prize for Physics|url=http://www.successstories.co.in/self-made-billionaire-investor-yuri-milner-sets-3-million-prize-for-physics/|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 11 November 1961 in Moscow, Yuri Milner was the second child of Russian intellectuals.&lt;ref name="forbes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0328/billionaires-11-profile-yuri-milner-billionaire-friended-web.html |title=The Billionaire Who Friended the Web |publisher=Forbes |date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-18 |first=Parmy |last=Olson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His father, {{ill|Bentsion Zakharovitch Milner|ru|Мильнер, Бенцион Захарович}}, was active in the sphere of management and organisation. He was Chief Deputy Director at the Institute of Economics of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guu.ru/info.php?id=1978 |title=Официальный сайт Государственного Университета Управления |publisher=Guu.ru |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betty Iosifovna Milner, Yuri's mother, worked at the capital's state-run virological laboratory for disease control. His older sister, eight years his senior, is an architect.

Milner studied [[theoretical physics]] at [[Moscow State University]], graduating in 1985. He went on to work at [[Lebedev Physical Institute]], one of the institutes of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], in the same department as the [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Vitaly Ginzburg]]. As a doctoral candidate in particle physics, Milner befriended Soviet [[nuclear physicist]] and [[human rights]] activist [[Andrei Sakharov]]. Sakharov's forward thinking would later influence Milner's venture investment strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Parmy Olson |url=https://blogs.forbes.com/parmyolson/2011/03/10/yuri-milner-billionaire-facebook-day-in-the-life/ |title=A Day In The Life Of Yuri Milner, Web Billionaire s |publisher=Blogs.forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Milner became the first non-[[émigré]] from the Soviet Union to go to the United States to receive an [[MBA]] at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="forbes1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/movers_and_shakers/article6391401.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=Mike | last=Harvey | title=Big shot Yuri Milner makes logical expansion of his network | date=30 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press quoted him as saying that he made this decision after "being disappointed in myself as a physicist".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/newsmaker-yuri-milner-115072301441_1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Milner was a commencement speaker for Wharton Business School 2017 class. &lt;ref&gt;https://graduation.wharton.upenn.edu/graduation-speakers/wharton-graduation-2017-speakers-announced/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlwMm5XehPg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
Milner started his business career selling [[grey market]] DOS computers in the Soviet Union, which displeased his father. When the national government collapsed, he stopped selling computers to enroll at the Wharton School to earn an MBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=WIRED | title=How Russian Tycoon Yuri Milner Bought His Way Into Silicon Valley | url=https://www.wired.com/2011/10/mf_milner/all/1 | author=Michael Wolff | date=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating, Milner spent the first half of the 1990s at the [[World Bank]]  in [[Washington, D.C.]], as a Russian banking specialist focused on the development of private sector banking. He has described his time at the World Bank as his "lost years", due to watching from afar the privatization of government holdings during the presidency of [[Boris Yeltsin]].&lt;ref name="forbes1"/&gt; In the spring of 1995, Milner was appointed CEO of Alliance-Menatep, an [[investment broker]]age company belonging to then oligarch [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]]. In December 1996 Milner worked as Vice President and Head of Investment Management of Menatep Bank. In February 1997 Milner was appointed the deputy chairman and the head of the investment division of [[Menatep Bank]] but left this position in early 1998&lt;ref&gt;http://moneymakerfactory.ru/spravochnik/yuriy-milner-istoriya-biznesa/&lt;/ref&gt;. At the time, the market makers described him as "a well-known professional, who will bring the bank valuable experience in international financial institutions and transactions in the Russian investment market"&lt;ref&gt;https://lenta.ru/lib/14190841/&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Russian Internet investor===

In 1999, after reading a review by [[Morgan Stanley]] analyst [[Mary Meeker]] on the prospects for online businesses, Milner decided to create an internet company. He sought funding from his friend from Menatep days Gregory Finger, who at the time led the Russian branch of the US investment fund New Century Holding.  The fund agreed to invest $4.5&amp;nbsp;million with the proviso that Milner and Finger each personally invest $750,000. Milner, Finger, and NCH created a new company, NetBridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lenta.ru/lib/14190841/#43|title=Мильнер, Юрий|website=lenta.ru|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, Milner became the president of Netbridge Services Ltd (netBridge) – the company that was, "created as an Internet incubator and investment fund".  Netbridge succeeded in transferring a variety of U.S.-pioneered internet business models to Russia, creating companies including the portal List.ru, online auction site Molotok.ru (based on [[eBay]]), free web-hosting Boom.ru (based on [[GeoCities]]), and online shop 24×7, using the formula of [[Amazon.com]].

In February 2001, netBridge and Port.ru (which owned Mail.ru) announced a merger. Milner became CEO of the new company named Mail.ru (though the legal name Port.ru was also retained).

From January 2003 to December 2004, Milner was the CEO of "Neftyanoi", owned by [[Igor Linshits]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In 2005, NCH shifted its focus from Russian Internet projects and Milner founded the investment fund Digital Sky Technologies (DST), becoming its chairman in 2006. A meeting through mutual friends resulted in [[Alisher Usmanov]] becoming a shareholder of Mail.ru Group in 2008.

In 2010 Mail.ru Group completed successful [[initial public offering]] on the [[London Stock Exchange]] with market valuation of $5.6&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;Mail.Ru Group IPO Pricing Announcement http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail.html?announcementId=10706676{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Milner stepped down from the role of chairman of Mail.ru and from the board of directors.&lt;ref name="corp.mail.ru"&gt;Mail.ru Group press release http://corp.mail.ru/en/press/news/1339&lt;/ref&gt; Dmitry Grishin was elected to the board and appointed as chairman while retaining his CEO position. There were no other changes to management or to the board.

Post Mail.ru Group’s IPO, DST is the sole vehicle for further international investments. The company is now fully independent of Mail.ru Group.&lt;ref&gt;Mail.ru Group prospectus {{cite web|url=http://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/7389V_-2010-11-5.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317075041/http://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/7389V_-2010-11-5.pdf |archivedate=17 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From May 2009 to January 2012 Milner was a member of the Commission on Modernization established by [[Dmitry Medvedev]], the Russian President from 2008 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://premier.gov.ru/en/|title=Dmitry Medvedev - The Russian Government|work=premier.gov.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Internet investor===

In January 2009, while in [[Palo Alto]], Milner became acquainted with [[Facebook]] founder [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. The meeting led to an agreement on 26 May 2009 under which DST bought a 1.96% stake in Facebook for $200&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gustin|first=Sam|title=Time Tech 40: The Most Influential Minds in Tech|url=http://business.time.com/2013/05/01/time-tech-40-the-ten-most-influential-tech-ceos/slide/yuri-milner-dst/|publisher=Time|accessdate=12 February 2014|date=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September 2010, Digital Sky Technologies (DST) changed its name to "Mail.ru Group".  The group's portfolio included Mail.ru, Odnoklassniki.ru, [[ICQ]], a minority stake in the social network [[VKontakte]] (Russian Facebook equivalent), online payments service OSMP.ru, e‑Port, as well as some other Russian assets.  Milner's commercial interests in Facebook, Zynga, and Groupon were transferred to [[DST Global]].  Milner became the CEO of DST Global and the chairman of the board of directors of Mail.ru Group. In November 2010, Mail.ru Group held its [[Public offering|offering]] on the [[London Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail.ru Group Limited Announces Intention to Conduct an Initial Public Offering and Listing on the London Stock Exchange|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20101010005091/en/Mail.ru-Group-Limited-Announces-Intention-Conduct-Initial#.UvvtQUJdXso|publisher=BusinessWire|accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2012, Milner stepped down from the role of chairman of Mail.ru and from the board of directors.&lt;ref name="corp.mail.ru"/&gt; Milner focused on international Internet investments.

DST Global became one of the world’s leading technology investors and its portfolio has included some of the world's most prominent internet companies, such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Airbnb, Spotify,  Alibaba, and others.&lt;ref name="bloombergtechconference2016.sched.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bloombergtechconference2016.sched.com/speaker/yuri_milner.1v7d8ns5|title=Yuri Milner's schedule for Bloomberg Tech Conference 2016|website=bloombergtechconference2016.sched.com|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 November 2017, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Milner had strong [[Kremlin]] backing for his investments in Facebook and Twitter.&lt;ref name="Kushner"/&gt;  Milner denied this allegations in his open letter published in ReCode &lt;ref&gt;https://www.recode.net/2017/11/5/16610242/yuri-milner-russia-twitter-facebook-paradise-papers&lt;/ref&gt;

The second initiative, Breakthrough Message, will be a $1 million annual prize for digital messages representing Earth and humanity, that could be decoded by another civilization. The messages will not be sent into space until a global discussion on the ethics of such a move has taken place.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt;

The third project, Breakthrough Starshot, was announced 12 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/stephen-hawking-interstellar-travel-starmus-speech&lt;/ref&gt; Starshot is a US$100 million program to develop a proof-of-concept [[light sail]] spacecraft fleet capable of making the journey to [[Alpha Centauri]] at 20% the [[speed of light]] (60 million m/s or 215 million km/h) taking about 20 years to get there, and about 4 years to notify Earth of a successful arrival.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160412-db"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=A Visionary Project Aims for Alpha Centauri, a Star 4.37 Light-Years Away |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/science/alpha-centauri-breakthrough-starshot-yuri-milner-stephen-hawking.html |date=12 April 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=12 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Stone |first=Maddie |url=https://gizmodo.com/a-russian-billionaire-and-stephen-hawking-want-to-build-1770467186 |title=Stephen Hawking and a Russian Billionaire Want to Build an Interstellar Starship |work=Gizmodo |date=12 April 2016 |accessdate=12 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Starshot home"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Initiative/3 |title=Breakthrough Starshot |work=Breakthrough Initiatives |date=12 April 2016 |accessdate=12 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 2017, the Breakthrough Discuss conference was held, during which the results of a year worth of data analysis was discussed. According to the researchers, 692 stars were analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/breakthrough-listen-first-detection-results-2017-4?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=A Russian tycoon's $100 million effort to listen for aliens has published its first results|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-05-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breakthrough Junior Challenge===

In September 2015, the Breakthrough Prize launched the Breakthrough Junior Challenge,&lt;ref&gt;[https://breakthroughjuniorchallenge.org/about], breakthroughjuniorchallenge.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siliconbeat.com/2015/09/14/whiz-kids-wanted-for-breakthrough-junior-challenge-with-250000-prize/?doing_wp_cron=1488114979.6444370746612548828125], silicon beat.com&lt;/ref&gt; a science competition for people between thirteen and eighteen years of age, in collaboration with [[Khan Academy]].

==Long-term vision==
Milner believes that the internet will develop into a "[[global brain]]"—which is often described as an intelligent network of individuals and machines—functioning as a nervous system for the planet Earth. He also envisages that the advent of the [[internet of things]] and ever increasing use of [[social media]] will increase humans' [[collective intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;Chrystia Freeland: [http://blogs.reuters.com/chrystia-freeland/2011/09/23/the-advent-of-the-global-brain/ The advent of the global brain]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Parr:[http://mashable.com/2010/11/16/could-facebook-become-the-basis-for-artificial-intelligence/ Could Facebook Become the Basis for Artificial Intelligence?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In an interview with ''[[Vedomosti]]'' in 2010, Milner said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the past few years I simply do not have time for hobbies. I am even starting to forget what I was fond of. Such as in the past it was reading of literature not related to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/articles/2010/12/28/nastupaet_era_lyudej_s_matematicheskim_skladom_uma_yurij | work=Vedomosti | first1=Anastasia | last1=Golitsyn | first2=Igor | last2=Tsukanov | title=There is coming an era for people with a mathematical state of mind | date=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Milner is married to former [[Haute couture|high fashion]] [[Model (profession)#Fashion models|model]] and contemporary artist Julia Milner ([[Married and maiden names|''née'']] Bochkova). She is interested in [[photography]]: during the 52nd Venice Biennale of Contemporary Art she produced a contribution entitled ''Click I Hope''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.russiandreams.info/en/photographer/milner | work=Russian Dreams Info | title=RUSSIAN DREAMS | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Milner bought a $100&amp;nbsp;million home in [[Los Altos Hills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/04/01/BUH21INM5M.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Kathleen | last=Pender | title=Yuri Milner buys $100 million Los Altos Hills home | date=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The compound spans three plots totaling seven hectares and includes a roughly {{convert|25500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} main house and a {{convert|5500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} guest house. The current tax bill is about $304,000 a year. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported the price as $100&amp;nbsp;million, saying it was the most ever paid for a single-family home in the United States. The property is [[Real estate appraisal|appraised]] by the [[Santa Clara County]] assessor at $50&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_20998327/russian-mogul-yuri-milner-silicon-valley-mansion-worth-half-its-price-100-million|title=Russian tycoon's Silicon Valley mansion worth half its $100 million purchase price, assessor says|work=mercurynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milner lives in [[Silicon Valley]] with his family.&lt;ref name="bloombergtechconference2016.sched.com"/&gt; Milner attends synagogue, but says that he is only minimally religiously observant.&lt;ref name=wired-mag/&gt;

'''İzmir Commodity Exchange'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itb.org.tr/en/Page/8-ice-brochure|title=ICE Brochure {{!}} İzmir Ticaret Borsası|last=The ICE|first=İzmir Commodity Exchange {{!}}|date=|website=itb.org.tr|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ICE) is a [[commodities exchange]] based in [[İzmir]], Turkey.  It was the first commodities exchange established in Turky and focuses on agricultural products.  It functions in accordance with the Turkish Law No. 5174 regarding the [[Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey]] and the Chambers and Commodity Exchanges.

==History==
The İzmir Commodity Exchange was established in İzmir, the 3rd largest province of Turkey, in 1891 as the first commodity exchange of Turkey.

İzmir has always been an important hub for agricultural production and one of the centers for domestic and foreign trade throughout the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Turkey. In fact, İzmir harbour was the most important export harbour of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the early 20th century, which made the city the host for the first efforts to systemize the agricultural markets and the first commodity exchange of Turkey.

In the second half of the 19th century, the boost in the volume of the trade in İzmir urged the merchants to seek for new methods and regulations in order to catch up with novelties. Although new warehouses had been built to store the goods, unbalanced price adjustments, lack of proper statistics to determine demand and supply, and uncertainty of the money markets used to negatively affect the commercial life of the city. These problems caused the tradesmen and producers to suffer great losses. The tradesmen of İzmir commenced to make several attempts to overcome these problems. The Commercial Assembly and İzmir Chamber of Commerce were established in 1850 and 1885, respectively. The English, French, Italians and the Dutch had their own chambers of commerce in İzmir. However, these attempts had fallen behind in creating solutions to the problems of the market.

Although the first legal arrangements in the Ottoman Empire were carried out in 1886, it is known that some attempts were made before this date to establish a commodity exchange in İzmir. It is also known that the building belonging to a tradesman called Nişli Hacı Ali Efendi was used as “the grain exchange” just before the 1890s. The arguments to establish a modern commodity exchange based on a legal status and conforming to certain rules were brought forward in the early 1890s. In 1891, two different commodity exchanges were attempted to be established by two different tradesmen, however, the General Commodity Exchange regulations specified only one commodity exchange in each city. Therefore, upon the inspections by the Ministry of Public Works, Nişli Hacı Ali Efendi’s Commodity Exchange was declared as the sole legal exchange in the city and it was inaugurated with a ceremony on Monday, 13 June 1892.

The first elections were held at the end of that year and the first board of directors was formed. The regulations came into effect on 21 January 1895. The products traded at the Exchange in 1897 were barley, wheat, refined flour, semolina, bran, rye, flour, corn, maize, chickpea, dry beans, black-eyed pea, hemp seed, vetch, aniseed, dent corn, sesame, broad bean, poppy seed, olive oil, cotton, cotton seed and opium poppy. The public was informed daily of the transactions and prices through the local newspapers, which made monitoring supply and demand volume of the market possible.

As the economic life was severely damaged and agricultural production decreased during the World War I and Turkish Independence War, İzmir Commodity Exchange experienced rough times. Following the independence of Turkey and declaration of the republic, the present building of the İzmir Commodity Exchange was built and opened with a ceremony on 11 June 1928.

Since then, İzmir Commodity Exchange has been serving its members and the society in general in the same building, the Exchange Palace, located at Gazi Boulevard No:2, Konak/İzmir.

'''Željko Kerum''' (born 25 September 1960) is a [[Croatia]]n [[entrepreneur]] and a [[politician]].&lt;ref name=sd_kok&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Hrvatska/tabid/66/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/45248/Default.aspx |title=Kerum voli Kuma, Kuret Bonda, a Ostojić Forrest Gumpa |date=2009-03-09 |accessdate=2009-05-02 |language=Croatian |work=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]] |last=Kovačić |first=Leo}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Mayor of Split|mayor]] of [[Split (city)|Split]], between 2009 and 2013, after which he failed to qualify for the second round of elections. He also owned the [[supermarket chain]] ''[[Kerum (supermarket chain)|Kerum]]'' until it folded in 2012.

==Early life==
Željko  Kerum was born in the village of Ogorje (part of [[Muć]]) in the [[Zagora (Croatia)|Dalmatian hinterland]]. He graduated from the Technical High School in [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Croatia]] in 1978. In 1981 he got his first job in the Split construction company ''Melioracija'' spending a year in [[Iraq]] working on military bases.

==Business career==
He founded the company ''Kerum'' in 1989, opening his first [[convenience store]] in 1990. Six years later he opened his first [[supermarket]] in the [[Lora (Split)|Lora]] neighborhood of Split. In 2003 he bought the ''Diokom'' industrial facilities (ex-''Jugoplastika'') and in 2007 he opened the ''Joker'' Shopping Mall, the largest in [[Dalmatia]] at the time.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zeljkokerumsplit.com/biografija-zeljka-keruma/ |title=Biografija Željka Keruma |work=Zeljkokerumsplit.com |language=Croatian |accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
In the first round of the 2009 elections for mayor of Split, Kerum (independent) won 40.21% of the popular vote, while his closest rival [[Ranko Ostojić]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|SDP]]) won 34.72%.&lt;ref name=izbori&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.izbori.hr/2009Lokalni/rezultati/rezultati.html |title=Rezultati lokalnih izbora 2009 |date=2009-05-18 |accessdate=2009-05-18 |language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 31, he won 58.42% of the vote, making him the incumbent mayor of Split.&lt;ref name=JL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jutarnji.hr/vijesti/izbori2009/detalji/art-2009,5,31,,165294.jl |title=Kerum: Zaposlit ću sve i riješiti stambene probleme |work=Jutarnji.hr |language=Croatian |accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009 during a live television interview on the ''[[Nedjeljom u 2]]'' talk show that airs on the Croatian state broadcaster [[HRT 1]], in response to host [[Aleksandar Stanković (journalist)|Aleksandar Stanković]]'s question if Serb businessmen are welcome in Croatia, Kerum answered: "If it was up to me I wouldn't let them because [[Serbs]] never brought us anything good in the past and they won't do it now. Not only Serbs, but also [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]]. And whoever is doing business with them will not make out OK". Asked further by Stanković if he would accept a man of Serb ethnicity as a son-in-law, Kerum answered emphatically: "No, never".

On January 16, 2011 the citizens of [[Split, Croatia|Split]], on the initiative of an informal group of citizens gathered on [[Facebook]], protested at the Prva voda beach on the park mountain [[Marjan, Split|Marjan]] in Split against a change of city urban planning regulation that allowed construction of restaurants and bars in the beach area. According to plans, on the proposed beach site a company owned by his mistress Fani Horvat planned to build such an object, with the destruction of protected wood area. The idea was perceived as a nepotistic venture and favouring of Kerum's own interests instead of the city's.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Split/tabid/72/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/126890/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Kerum also caused a stir in Split when he proposed to build a 40 meter tall statue of Christ the Redeemer to rival that of Brazil.

In 2011, he became a candidate in the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2011]] on the electoral list of the [[Croatian Democratic Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.poslovni.hr/vijesti/hdz-predao-izborne-liste-kosor-prva-u-petoj-jedinici-190541.aspx | language = Croatian | title = HDZ predao izborne liste, Kosor prva u petoj jedinici | newspaper = [[Poslovni dnevnik]] | date = 2011-11-14 | accessdate = 2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Croatian local elections, 2013]] Kerum won only 18.57% of the popular vote while re-running for mayor, which did not qualify him to the second round of the elections. Also, Kerum's [[Croatian Civic Party]] won only 12.41% of the popular votes for the city council of Split.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/bandic-pobjednik-kerum-porazen-milanovic-ponizen/678557.aspx | title = Bandić pobjednik, Kerum poražen, Milanović ponižen | language = Croatian | date = 20 May 2013 | accessdate = 4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2015]], his Croatian civic party won only 2234 votes in the two Dalmatian constituencies and became a non-parliamentary party.

==Personal life==

In 1989 Kerum married Anka Lalin, with whom he has a daughter and son. In 2009, he surprised the public by publicly announcing he was divorcing his wife to be with his pregnant mistress Fani Horvat, who was nearly 25 years his junior. The news caused many in the media to point out the hypocrisy in his political image, where he has consistently presented himself as a supporter of traditional values and a conservative world view, but had been participating in an extramarital affair.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.net.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/page/2009/10/19/0640006.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerum has been known to own expensive cars including a [[Hummer]], a [[Mercedes S500]], a [[BMW 7]], a [[Maybach 62]], a [[Ferrari F430]], and a [[Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano]].&lt;ref name="24 sata"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.24sata.hr/news/prijatelju-posudis-ti-meni-malo-taj-svoj-novi-ferrari/155866/ | title=Prijatelju, posudiš ti meni malo taj svoj novi Ferrari? | work=[[24 sata (Croatia)|24 sata]] | date=January 26, 2010 | language=Croatian | accessdate=2010-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20030826/automoto01.asp | title=Maybach u Splitu! | work=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]] | date=August 26, 2003 | language=Croatian | accessdate=2010-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/kerum-vozi-ferrari-kupljen-na-braniteljsku-povlasticu/427020.aspx | title=Kerum vozi Ferrari kupljen na braniteljsku povlasticu? | work=[[Index.hr]] | date=March 25, 2009 | language=Croatian | accessdate=2010-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Cessna Citation X]], a [[business jet]] worth approximately US$17 million, is the most expensive privately owned aircraft in Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/kerumova-cessna-najskuplji-hrvatski-privatni-zrakoplov/841530/ | title=Kerumova Cessna najskuplji hrvatski privatni zrakoplov | date=June 24, 2010 | work=[[Jutarnji list]] | language=Croatian | accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
