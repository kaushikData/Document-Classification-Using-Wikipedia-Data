[[File:Queen Mother Moore.jpeg|thumb|[[Queen Mother Moore]] being honored for service uplifting the African diaspora]]

In many parts of [[West Africa]], there is an old [[chieftaincy]] tradition, and the [[Akan people]] have developed their own hierarchy, which exists alongside the [[democracy|democratic]] structure of the country. The Akan word for the ruler or one of his various courtiers is "'''Nana'''"&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA; 'Nana (title)' redirects here--&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|æ|n|ə}}). In colonial times, Europeans translated it as "chief", but that is not an exact equivalent. Other sources speak of "kings" which is also not entirely correct, especially in the case of the said courtiers. The term "chief" has become common even among modern [[Ghanaian]]s, though it would be more correct to use the expression "Nana" without translation wherever possible.

== History ==
The roots of Akan chieftaincy are unknown. Written sources are scarce. When the Akan were settling in the [[Tekyiman]] Region, in the period before 1300, they had already long used the chieftaincy system. The paramount chief held a position that can be compared to that of an [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] king.

When the [[Republic of Ghana]] was founded in 1957, it was agreed that the chieftaincy system should be respected.

== Present time ==
Chieftaincy is officially accepted. Politicians ask chiefs for advice because usually they are closer to the people. The highest committee is the National [[House of Chiefs]] in [[Kumasi]]. There are also Regional Houses of Chiefs. In case of problems between the chiefs, the House of Chiefs has a legal function to adjudicate in such matters.

== Hierarchy ==
The highest rank is that of a [[paramount chief]]. Within the Akan ethnic group there are different tribes, such as the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]], Akyem, Kwahu, Akwapim, Assin, or the [[Fante people|Fante]].

Ranked below the paramount chiefs, there are chiefs and sub-chiefs. A sub-chief can be compared to the [[mayor]] of a town, except that his office is hereditary as opposed to elective. The chiefs have their own territories, and apart from overseeing them, they have a function at the courts of their paramount chiefs as their ministers. Most of the functions are traditional, while some have been created recently:

A chief [[arbitration|arbitrates]] and decides political and economic questions in his area. When he is installed, he receives a [[regnal name|stool name]]. Usually, all chiefs who belong to a reigning lineage have the same name – an ordinal being added to distinguish between all of them.

===Omanhene===
The English translation of the title [[Omanhene]] is "paramount chief". In rare cases, [[Queen mothers (Africa)|Queen mothers]] themselves would be kings, a prime example being [[Okyenhene]] [[Nana Afia Dokuaa]]. This and the position of Obaatan or Queen mother are the only ones that are obtained through descent from the ruling clan.

===''Krontihene''===
The Krontihene is caretaker of the land and second-in-command after the Omanhene.

===''Ankobeahene''===
''Ankobea'' means one who stays at home or does not go anywhere. The Ankobeahene is the caretaker of the palace.

===''Obaatan''===
Obaatan means "parent" and is a female role. Her symbol is the egg, out of which all other chiefs came. She is Omanhene's counsellor. When Omanhene's stool is vacant, Obaatan suggests the next incumbent. She is expected to consider all factors such as the character of the available candidates, their royal descent and their contribution to the royal family. Mostly the lineage and order of birth is given a paramount consideration in the selection process.
Although found in other traditions, the position of Obaatan does not fit into the Akan chieftaincy structure proper. The one who suggests and nominates the Omanhene amongst the Akans is the Obaahemaa (or Queen mother).

===''Tufohene''===
The "warlord" is the head of all the [[Asafo]] companies (or head of the gunners). Tufohene translates loosely in Akan as 'the chief of the gunners', .

===''Asafohene''===
The Asafohene is the head of a single Asafo company.

===''Manwerehene''===
The head of the interior.

===''Sanaahene''===
The head of the treasury.

===''Adontehene''===
There are four positions describing military flanks. The Adontehene is the one who goes in front of the army.

===''Nkyidom''===
The Nkyidom is in the last position. He collects the soldiers who are left behind and sends them back to the army. During Odambea, the Nkyidom always sits in the last palanquin.

===''Nifahene''===
The Nifahene holds the right flank of the army's formation.

===''Benkumhene''===
The Benkumhene holds the left flank of the army's formation (also in modern governance known as the left wing).

===''Akyempimhene''===
If there is anything to distribute or to share, the [[Akyempimhene]] (or vice-king) has to do it. He is the first son of the king. He also protects the king, his father, with each king deciding whether to give the title to his literal son or to a close favourite. He also enjoys the authority of arriving in a palanquin after the Asantehene is seated; he alone has that authority to do so. He is also the head of all the Kumasi royals. Otumfuo Opoku Ware (Katakyie) created this title. Usually the first sons of the kings are the ones that ascend this stool. He is also the head of the Kyidom clan (Fekuo). It should be noted here that due to the matrilineal system of inheritance, sons do not automatically succeed their fathers as kings. Kings are by and large selected from among the sons of the deceased king's close female relations. This title is therefore a convenient means of ennobling a king's son without upsetting the royal succession.

===''Mankrado''===
The Mankrado's function is purification. He puts leaves into water, then sprinkles it over the Omanhene. He also always has salt in his pocket so that he can make things taste better for the Omanhene.

===''Guantuahene''===
The title of the Guantuahene is a comparatively recent innovation. The Guantoahene is the one to whom people can turn for shelter and mercy.

===''Nsumankwahene''===
The Nsumankwahene watches the oracle. This title is also a relatively recent creation.
The Nsumankwahene is a spiritual head of the community/communities. In the past it was chief Priest who performed that role

===''Nkosuohene''===
The Nkosuohene is responsible for the development of the region. The title is a new one and was adopted from the Ashanti, who had made it up earlier. This title was created to honour someone who does not have to be a member of a royal family. There are some foreigners who have been honoured with this title. It was created to appreciate the contribution of non-royals.

== Entourage ==
The most important person in the chief's entourage is the priest or priestess (''Okomfo''). Traditionally, the priest tells the chief when it is time to start a war or to marry, for example.

There is also a stool wife. No matter whether a chief is married or not, when installed, he will be married to a very young girl. Nowadays, it is obligatory, and [[polygamy]] is still legal. Today, the symbolic act is sufficient: During parades, a stool wife sits in front of the chief.

A chief has one or more [[linguists]] (''Okyeame''). A chief never talks in public, but conveys messages through his linguist, who is also responsible for the pouring of [[libations]].

== Queen Mother ==
[[File:The Childrens Museum of Indianapolis - Queen Mothers stool.jpg|thumb|right|An Akan stool believed to be for a Queen mother, 1940–1965, in the collection of the [[Children's Museum of Indianapolis]]]]
The title of Queen mother can relate to the rank of a paramount queen, a queen or a sub-queen. The Akan honorific is the same as for the men, "Nana". When using English, Ghanaians often say "queen mother". This woman is not necessarily the respective chief's mother, although she is usually related to him. Her role in the system is to have an eye on the social conditions, and a personally capable Queen mother has been known to equal or even surpass a reigning chief in terms of power and prestige. A good example of this happening is the case of Queen [[Yaa Asantewa]].
The Queen mother (Ohenmaa)suppose to nominate some for the position of the chief incase it become vacant however in some areas it is done by "Abusuapanyin" (head of the clan) in consultation with other family members

== Regalia ==

===Personal ornaments===
On special occasions, chiefs wear the traditional cloth, which is a six-yard-long piece of fabric, wrapped around the body and worn as a [[toga]]. Female chiefs wear two pieces of fabric that can be of different designs.

The jewellery is very ample and used to be made of gold. Nowadays, most chiefs wear imitation gold. The head-dress usually takes the form of a crown. It can be made of metal or of black velvet, ornamented with metal. Chiefs have traditional sandals, and the wearing of sandals is symbolic for them. When a chief abdicates, he takes off his sandals.

===Fly-whisk (''Bodua'')===
When riding in a [[palanquin]], chiefs hold a [[fly-whisk]] in one hand and a [[ceremonial sword]] in the other. The fly-whisk is made of animal hair.

===Sword (''Afena'')===
The ceremonial short sword is used for animal sacrifice. The chief touches the animal's throat symbolically with his sword before someone else cuts it with a sharp knife.

===Palanquin (''Apakan'')===
During a durbar, which is a special parade, some chiefs are carried in a [[palanquin#Ghana|palanquin]]. Subchiefs have to walk. The palanquins can have the form of a chair or of a bed.

===Stool (''Dwa'')===
Instead of a throne, Akan chiefs traditionally sit on a stool. When they die, their stools are painted black and stored in a sacred room.
This sacred room is called ''Nkonwafie'' (stool house). If the deceased chief was the first to have sat on that stool, the person's name becomes the first '''I'''. Whoever sits on that stool in the future would be called by the first chief's name but would have '''II''' attached. The name becomes the new chief's stool name.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Umbrella (''Bamkyim'')===
Very large umbrellas made of silk and other rich fabrics are used to shade a chief and show from afar that a chief is approaching.

'''Anactoria''' (or '''Anaktoria''') is the name of a woman mentioned by poet [[Sappho]] as a lover of hers in [[Sappho's Fragment 16]] (Lobel-Page edition) [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/sappho/sappho0.htm], often referred to by the title "To an Army Wife, in [[Sardis]]". [[Sappho 31]] is traditionally called the "Ode to Anactoria", though no name appears in it (A. C. Swinburne, quoted in Lipking 1988).

[[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] wrote a long poem in ''[[Poems and Ballads]]'' titled ''Anactoria'', in which Sappho addresses Anactoria in imagery that includes [[sadomasochism]], [[cannibalism]], and [[dystheism]].[http://www.letrs.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/acs-idx.pl?type=section&amp;rgn=level1&amp;byte=97791]  Lipking (1988) discusses Swinburne's poem.

'''Apabhranśa''' ({{lang-sa|अपभ्रंश}}, {{IPA-sa|əpəˈbʱrənʃə|IPA}}, [[Prakrit]]: {{IAST|''Avahansa''}}) is a term used by [[Vyākaraṇa|vyākaraṇin]] (grammarians) since [[Patanjali|Patañjali]] to refer to languages spoken in north India before the rise of the modern languages. In [[Indology]], it is used as an [[umbrella term]] for the dialects forming the transition&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last= Shapiro | first= Michael C. | year= 2003 | chapter= Hindi | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jPR2OlbTbdkC&amp;pg=PA250&amp;dq=indo-aryan&amp;sig=cUNurxJKkTLfKf8uiMd7pWX2RC0 | editor1-last= Cardona | editor1-first= George | editor2-last= Jain | editor2-first= Dhanesh | title= The Indo-Aryan Languages | publisher= Routledge | isbn= 978-0-415-77294-5 }}{{pn|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages|late Middle]] and the early [[Indo-Aryan languages|Modern Indo-Aryan languages]], spanning the period between the 6th and 13th centuries CE. However, these dialects are conventionally included in the Middle Indo-Aryan period.&lt;ref name=avabhansa&gt;{{cite book|last=Shastri|first=Dr Devendra Kumar|title=Apabhramsha Bhasha Sahitya Ki Shodh Pravritiyan|year=1996|publisher=Bhartiya Jnanpith.

Apabhraṃśa literature is a valuable source for the history of North India for the period spanning the 12th to 16th centuries.&lt;ref name="Apabhramsha Sahitya 2003"&gt;Apabhramsha Sahitya, Devendra Kumar Jain, Mahavir Jain Vidyalay Suvarna Mahotsav Granth, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The term [[Prakrit]], which includes [[Pali]], is also used as a cover term for the [[vernacular]]s of North India that were spoken perhaps as late as the 4th to 8th centuries, but some scholars use the term for the entire Middle Indo-Aryan period. Middle Indo-Aryan languages gradually transformed into Apabhraṃśa dialects, which were used until about the 13th century. The Apabhraṃśas later evolved into Modern Indo-Aryan languages. The boundaries of these periods are somewhat hazy, not strictly chronological. Modern North Indian languages are often considered to have begun to develop a distinct identity around the 11th century - while Apabhraṃśas were still in use - and became fully distinct by the end of the 12th century.

A significant amount of Apabhraṃśa literature has been found in [[Jainism|Jain]] libraries. While [[Amir Khusrow]] and [[Kabir]] were writing in a language quite similar to modern Hindi, many poets, especially in regions that were still ruled by Hindu kings, continued to write in Apabhraṃśa. These authors include [[Saraha]], [[Tilopa]] and [[Kanha (poet)|Kanha]] of [[Kamarupa]]; Devasena of [[Dhar]] (9th century CE);  Pushpadanta of [[Manyakheta]] (9th century CE); Dhanapal; Muni Ramsimha; [[Hemachandra]] of [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]]; and [[Raighu]] of [[Gwalior]] (15th century CE).

An early example of the use of Apabhraṃśa is the ''Vikramorvashiyam'' of [[Kālidāsa]], when [[Pururavas]] asks the animals in the forest about his beloved who had disappeared. Compositions in Apabhramsha continued until Vikram Samvat 1700, when Bhagavatidasa wrote ''Migankaleha Chariu''.&lt;ref name="Apabhramsha Sahitya 2003"/&gt;

The only known example of an Apabhramsa work by a Muslim is the [[Sandesh Rasak]] of Abdur Rahman of Multan, possibly written around Circa 1000 A.D.

== Writers &amp; Poets ==

The '''Balassi Institute''' ({{lang-hu|Balassi Intézet}}) is a worldwide [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]]  [[Culture|cultural]] organization funded by the ministry of education and culture of [[Hungary]]. The institute spreads and promotes [[Hungarian language]] and [[Hungarian culture|culture]] abroad. The Institute plays a key role in developing and attaining [[Hungary]]’s objectives in the area of [[cultural diplomacy]]. As an organizational hub, it coordinates and directs all activities provided by Hungarian institutes abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.balassiintezet.hu/en/balassi-institute-hq/ |title=Bálint Institute - About us |publisher=www.balassiintezet.hu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is named after [[Hungarian literature|Hungarian]] [[Renaissance]] lyric poet [[Bálint Balassi]].

== Bálint Balassi ==
[[File:Portrait of Bálint Balassi 17. c..jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Bálint Balassi]]]]
[[Bálint Balassi]] (1554–1594) was a [[Renaissance]] lyric poet and regarded as a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] in the deepest sense, the first to write the words "my sweet homeland" in reference to [[Hungary]], a phrase which became a renowned canon of [[patriotism]] in [[Hungarian literature]] throughout the centuries that followed. Born into one of the wealthiest and most powerful [[Nobility|noble]] families of the country, with strong ties to the [[Habsburg]] court, Balassi was educated by the [[Protestant]] reformer Péter Bornemisza and was already writing notable verse at a very young age. Unfortunately, his short life was marked by financial ruin and a series of social failures: an unhappy marriage, unrequited love, slander, legal troubles and a less than prominent military career. He died early in the war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] occupation of [[Hungary]] during the siege of [[Esztergom]].&lt;br /&gt;
Balassi was a true Renaissance figure, a child of his age, a noble writer who was reckless in romance and hot-tempered, but also a [[Renaissance Humanist|humanist]] with exceptionally refined taste. It was he who was responsible for the rebirth of [[Hungarian literature]], transforming [[Latin]] into the Hungarian language, making him the second world-class Hungarian poet after [[Janus Pannonius]]. A worthwhile contemporary of [[Ronsard]], [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]] and [[Philip Sidney|Sidney]], he was a loyal adherent to the Neo-Platonic philosophy of love and [[Francesco Petrarch]]'s mode of poetic expression, which he refreshed with local flavor and new poetic solutions. Having been influenced by [[German literature|German]], [[Italian literature|Italian]], [[Polish literature|Polish]], [[Turkish literature|Turkish]] and perhaps also [[Croatian literature|Croatian]], Balassi absorbed Neo-Latin poetry at an early age, and eventually came to hold the same position in the history of Hungarian literature as that of Petrarch in Italian literature. Poems had already been written in Hungarian before him, but Balassi's technique of literary expression – fictive lyrical autobiographies in cycles of verse – was his true innovative gift to Hungarian literature. According to traditional historic accounts, he assembled his poems together, written in "his own hand" shortly before or after he left Hungary for [[Poland]] in 1589. The unprinted volume circulated for years thereafter and comprised a collection of 100 poems that depicted Balassi as a heavenly version of himself; hopelessly struggling with love, losing to Cupid, burned on the pyre of passion, relinquishing Julia, leaving his homeland, searching for his old love in a new one, embarking on a pilgrimage through hell, arguing with God in poetic guilt.  It was this "virtual" Balassi that took the place of the "real" unsuccessful one and sparked the imagination of subsequent generations. His students not only respected him as an emblematic figure of Hungarian literature (and of the Hungarian language in a broader sense), but also of culture, worthy of following as a European model for the renewal of civilized life.&lt;br /&gt;
The more we know about [[Bálint Balassi]] and his work, the more he seems to be a poet who transcended borders. He was literally born on a border, in the Northern Hungarian-Turkish territory near [[Poland]]. His mother-tongue was Hungarian, but he probably learned Slovakian and Polish from his nanny first. There is no doubting the honesty of his religious emotions, although he belonged to several denominations during his life - raised by a [[Lutheran]], [[Calvinist]] parents, and then the influence of [[Jesuits]] during his adulthood. He lived for years with his father in the Court of [[Vienna]] and in the royal courts of [[Transylvania]] and [[Poland]], perhaps becoming more familiar with the refined order of royal style and etiquette than any other Hungarian.  His religious verse dealt with the passion of romance while his romantic poems used theological terms and soared to religious heights. Researchers have debated for years whether his descriptive language and place in Hungarian literature was that of the first Renaissance poet or that of the last [[troubadour]].  Whatever the case may be, Balassi was both archaic and ahead of his time, renewing contemporary fashion by reaching back to ancient sources and later incorporating features of [[Mannerism]] and [[Turkey|Turkish]] poetic forms. Moreover, he did so in Hungarian, which offered no previous traditional model to follow. According to legend, he spoke seven languages in addition to his own: [[Latin]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Slovak language|Slovakian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. Bálint Balassi was not only the first, but also the most deeply European Hungarian [[poet]], and to this day his work continues to exemplify the openness of Hungarian intellectual life to [[Europe]] and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.balassiintezet.hu/en/balassi-2013040404/ |title=Bálint Balassi |publisher=www.balassiintezet.hu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hungarian Cultural Institutes ====
[[File:Collegium Hungaricum Berlin.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Collegium Hungaricum Berlin]] (.CHB) in [[Berlin]]]]

The first Hungarian institutes abroad, the so-called [[Collegium Hungaricum (Balassi institute)|Collegium Hungaricum]], were established by Kunó Klebelsberg (minister of culture at the time) in the 1920s in order to build relations with the international scientific community (in Vienna and Berlin in 1924, in Rome and Paris in 1927). Organising scientific life and education make up a fundamental part of the institutes’ activity even today. Apart from differences shaped by history, there are also variations in the scope of activities, services and equipment of the institutes. Some of them maintain libraries, Hungarian language teaching centers and  galleries in addition to their primary work in culture, education and organising science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.balassiintezet.hu/en/international-relations/ |title=International Directorate |publisher=www.balassiintezet.hu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==== Joint Institutes ====
'''Joint institutes''' are independently functioning institutions abroad promoting Hungarian culture, involved in broadly defined Hungarian cultural diplomacy via partnership and joint institutional agreements with the Balassi Institute.
The aim of establishing the network was to enhance cooperation between coexisting institutions and the Balassi Institute in order to reach their shared strategic goals. Henceforth, the Balassi Institute supports certain programs of member institutes as well as their cultural, scientific and educational projects and helps them build relations with private and public institutions in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.balassiintezet.hu/en/international-relations/the-network-of-joint-institutes/ |title=The network of Joint Institutes |publisher=www.balassiintezet.hu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

=== Education ===
The Institute, as a center for education and scientific cooperation, fulfills a supporting, coordinating and funding function in the international network of Hungarian Studies institutions and in the teaching of Hungarian as a foreign language.

==== Methodology Center for Teaching Hungarian as a Second Language ====
The Institute not only provides support for Hungarian language training abroad, it also offers a wide range of language programs within Hungary. At the Institute’s central branch located in Budapest, those wishing to learn Hungarian can choose from a unique selection of in-depth courses geared toward various levels. Thanks to its highly trained, experienced staff of language teachers, the Balassi Institute is a leader in the methodology of teaching Hungarian as a Second Language. Its foremost task is not only to develop teaching materials for non-native speakers, but also to provide appropriate educational resources to teachers of Hungarian as a heritage language abroad. Other than the organization of seminars, conferences and training sessions, the publication of professional journals, e-textbooks and e-books also forms a vital part of the Institute’s mission.&lt;ref name="edu"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.balassiintezet.hu/en/hungarian-studies/ |title=Hungarian Studies |publisher=www.balassiintezet.hu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Learning Opportunities for Foreign Citizens ====
Programs either 10 months or 2–4 weeks in duration can be attended by scholarship or payment of tuition. Year-by-year, nearly 350 foreign students receive scholarships to participate in courses offered in Budapest. Students—who arrive from all around the globe—have the opportunity to experience life in Hungary first-hand, benefit from intense language training in the classroom and forge lifelong friendships. Our recently established Balassi Alumni Program seeks to keep the network of former students alive.&lt;ref name="edu" /&gt;

==== Program in Hungarian Language and Hungarian Studies ====
This course is open to foreign university students not of Hungarian descent; the purpose is to supplement language skills and cultural knowledge acquired at foreign universities. Completion of the internationally recognized ECL language exam is a requirement at the end of this intense language course. Hungarian Studies courses provide a comprehensive, interdisciplinary examination of Hungary’s cultural heritage as well as of Hungarian society today.&lt;ref name="edu" /&gt;

==== Program in Hungarian Language and Culture ====
The purpose of this course is to strengthen the cultural identities of Hungarians living in diaspora communities. Young people of Hungarian descent—from outside the Carpathian Basin—are eligible for scholarships to this program. This specialized course focuses on increasing language competencies of speakers lacking formal education in Hungarian; the ECL language exam is a requirement for course completion. Participants receive a comprehensive, interdisciplinary examination of Hungary’s cultural heritage and Hungarian society today.&lt;ref name="edu" /&gt;

==== Literary Translation Program ====
Non-Hungarian, foreign citizens can apply to this program, intended for those university graduates who have chosen the translation of Hungarian literature and the promotion of Hungarian culture abroad as the focus of their careers. While a practical introduction to literary translation forms the backbone of this program, in-depth instruction in Hungarian language and literature is also provided. The number of translations published throughout the years attests to the ability of the Institute’s literary translation alumni.&lt;ref name="edu" /&gt;

==== Preparatory Program for University Entry ====
Thanks to a series of bilateral cultural agreements, many non-Hungarian, citizens are able to attend this program on a scholarship; while the Scholarship Board for Minority Hungarians provides financial support to students of Hungarian descent. This preparatory program enables foreign students to acquire the kind of technical vocabulary and language proficiency demanded by the advanced-level, university entrance exam. Students who successfully complete the final exam may gain entry to those B.A.-level courses listed in the call for grant applications.&lt;ref name="edu" /&gt;

=== The Guest Lecturer Network ===
The Institute’s network of guest instructors provides support for the teaching of Hungarian Studies and Language at over 30 foreign universities.&lt;br /&gt;
Lecturers are sent from Hungary to participate in programs at nearly 30 universities throughout Europe, thereby establishing close relations between Hungary’s universities and the rest of the continent, while also laying the groundwork for future cultural and scholarly programs in the field of Hungarian Studies. Regularly held conferences, meetings and training sessions continue to further and deepen close professional exchanges.&lt;br /&gt;
Facilitating the teaching of Hungarology – also called Hungarian Studies- at foreign universities is at the forefront of the institute’s international activity. Throughout the world more than fifty universities offer Hungarian language classes and an opportunity to meet Hungarian culture at lectorates, Hungarian departments and specialised Hungarian courses included in other majors.&lt;br /&gt;
The Balassi Institute as a legal successor of the International Hungarology Center sends visiting professors to more than thirty universities, with an average of 1500-2000 students attending their courses annually. Visiting professors’ tasks, in addition to classroom teaching, involve joining research projects, encouraging building relations with Hungarian universities and colleges, urging students to go on study tours in Hungary, taking an active part in introducing Hungarian culture to foreigners and organising local cultural events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.balassiintezet.hu/en/hungarian-studies/the-guest-lecturer-network/ |title=The Guest Lecturer Network |publisher=www.balassiintezet.hu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scholarships ===

==== Hungarian Scholarship Board ====
The '''Hungarian Scholarship Board (HSB)''' Office provides [[scholarship]]s for studying and to research, based on bilateral agreements. Therefore, Hungarian students and researchers can apply to a foreign country, and foreigners can apply to [[Hungary]].&lt;br /&gt;
Since January 2007 the Hungarian Scholarship Board Office operates under the auspices of the Balassi Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.scholarship.hu/HSB/tabid/184/language/en-US/Default.aspx |title=Balassi Institute - Hungarian Scholarship Board Office |publisher=www.scholarship.hu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227151449/http://www.scholarship.hu/HSB/tabid/184/language/en-US/Default.aspx |archivedate=2014-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.scholarship.hu/Englishsite/Generalinformation/tabid/185/language/en-US/Default.aspx |title=HSB - General information |publisher=www.scholarship.hu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228175815/http://www.scholarship.hu/Englishsite/Generalinformation/tabid/185/language/en-US/Default.aspx |archivedate=2014-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Campus Hungary ====
[[File:Campus Hungary logo.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]
The '''Campus Hungary''' program aims to enhance international student [[Social mobility|mobility]] in [[higher education]], both in terms of having more incoming foreign students to Hungary and also having more Hungarian students studying abroad. The program supports Hungarian students, academics and university staff with different kinds of [[scholarship]]s for partial studies to study abroad and gain experience. The main goal of the program is to support and facilitate the [[internationalisation]] of Hungarian [[higher education]] by initiating and deepening cooperation with foreign [[university|higher education institution]]s and achieving [[knowledge]] exchange by means of student mobility.&lt;br /&gt;
The Campus Hungary program is executed with the [[financial]] support of the [[European Union]] in the framework of the Social Renewal Operational Program (TÁMOP) of Hungary. It is implemented by the consortium of the Balassi Institute and the Tempus Public Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.campushungary.hu/about-us |title=About the Campus Hungary Program |publisher=www.campushungary.hu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Márton Áron College ===

=== Publishing Hungary ===
[[File:Publishing Hungary logo.png|thumb|right|250px]]
The '''Publishing Hungary''' Program was established by the National Cultural Fund of Hungary.&lt;br /&gt;
The main purpose of the program is to bring Hungarian [[publication]]s — whether [[literary]] or [[non-fiction]], recently published or classical works — to the attention of the international [[bookselling|book trade]] and readers alike. From 2012 it will contribute 100 million [[forint]]s yearly to the support of Hungary’s participation on international book festivals, an effort coordinated by the Balassi Institute and other Hungarian institutes abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.balassiintezet.hu/en/publishing-hungary/ |title=Publishiung Hungary |publisher=www.balassiintezet.hu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304134857/http://www.balassiintezet.hu/en/publishing-hungary/ |archivedate=2014-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The National Cultural Fund (NKA) will endow 100 million forints per year for participating on international book fairs  between 2012 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://publishinghungary.hu/hirek/nemzeteket_osszehozo_konyvvasarok/ |title=Nemzeteket összehozó könyvvásárok |publisher=www.publishinghungary.hu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25 |language=hu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325192309/http://publishinghungary.hu/hirek/nemzeteket_osszehozo_konyvvasarok/ |archivedate=2014-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baul''' or '''Bauls''' ({{lang-bn|বাউল}}) are a group of mystic minstrels from [[Bengal]] region of the [[South Asia]], which includes [[Bangladesh]] and the Indian states of [[West Bengal]] and [[Tripura]]. Bauls constitute both a syncretic religious sect and a musical tradition. Bauls are a very heterogeneous group, with many sects, but their membership mainly consists of [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava Hindu]]s and [[Sufism|Sufi Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Baul |title=Baul (Indian music) |date=18 June 2015 |website=Encyclopædia Britannica Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-02-06/news-and-interviews/28126586_1_sound-barrier-dur-dalai-lama|title=Bauled over|date=6 Feb 2010|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can often be identified by their distinctive clothes and musical instruments. [[Lalon|Lalon Shah]] is regarded as the most celebrated Baul saint in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Multiple editors|title=World and its People: Eastern and Southern Asia|year=2007|publisher=Marshal Cavendish Corporation|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7614-7631-3|page=480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paul |first=Harendra Chandra |chapter=Origin of the Bauls and their Philosophy |year=1987 |editor-last=Khan |editor-first=Shamsuzzaman |editor-link=Shamsuzzaman Khan |title=Folklore of Bangladesh |volume=Volume 1 |location=Dhaka |publisher=Bangla Academy |page=257 |quote=Faquir Lalan-Shah (1775–1891 A.D.), its greatest exponent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chowdhury|first=Kabir|title=Folk Poems From Bangladesh|year=1985|publisher=Bangla Academy|location=Dhaka|pages=ii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Bauls comprise only a small fraction of the Bengali population, their influence on the [[culture of Bengal]] is considerable. In 2005, the Baul tradition of [[Bangladesh]] was included in the list of [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=30973&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]. UNESCO. 25 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The origin of the word ''Baul'' is debated. Some modern scholars, like [[Shashibhusan Dasgupta]] have suggested that it may be derived either from [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[vatula]]'', which means "enlightened, lashed by the wind to the point of losing one's sanity, god's madcap, detached from the world, and seeker of truth", or from ''vyakula'', which means "restless, agitated" and both of these derivations are consistent with the modern sense of the word, which denotes the inspired people with an ecstatic eagerness for a spiritual life, where a person can realise his union with the eternal beloved&amp;nbsp;– the ''Moner Manush'' (the person of the heart).&lt;ref&gt;Das Gupta, Shashibhusan (1946, reprint 1995). ''Obscure Religious Cults'', Calcutta: Firma KLM, {{ISBN|81-7102-020-8}}, pp.160-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The origin of Bauls is not known exactly, but the word "Baul" has appeared in Bengali texts as old as the 15th century. The word is found in the ''[[Chaitanya Bhagavata]]'' of [[Vrindavana Dasa Thakura]] as well as in the ''[[Chaitanya Charitamrita]]'' of [[Krishnadasa Kaviraja]].&lt;ref&gt;Das Gupta, Shashibhusan (1946, reprint 1995). ''Obscure Religious Cults'', Calcutta: Firma KLM, {{ISBN|81-7102-020-8}}, p.160ff&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars maintain that it is not clear when the word took its sectarian significance, as opposed to being a synonym for the word ''madcap, agitated''. Bauls are a part of the culture of rural [[Bengal]]. Many attempts have been made to ascertain the origin of Bauls but there is wide disagreement among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Openshaw|first=Jeanne|authorlink=Jeanne Openshaw|title=Seeking Bauls of Bengal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGDWuQ-wjB8C&amp;pg=PA58|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-81125-5|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; But they agree that no founders have been acknowledged either by Bauls themselves or others.&lt;ref name="Seeking Bāuls of Bengal"&gt;{{cite book|last=Openshaw|first=Jeanne|authorlink=Jeanne Openshaw|title=Seeking Bauls of Bengal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGDWuQ-wjB8C&amp;pg=PA56|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-81125-5|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever their origin, Baul thought has mixed elements of [[Tantra]], Sufi Islam, Vaishnavism and [[Buddhism]]. They are thought to have been influenced by the Hindu tantric sect of the [[Kartabhaja]]s, as well as Tantric Vaishnava schools like the [[Vaishnava-Sahajiya]]. Some scholars find traces of these thoughts in the ancient practices of [[yoga]] as well as the ''[[Charyapada]]'', a collection of Buddhist hymns that are the first known example of written Bengali. The Bauls themselves attribute their lack of historical records to their reluctance to leave traces behind.  Dr. Jeanne Openshaw writes that the music of the Bauls appears to have been passed down entirely in oral form until the end of the 19th century, when it was first transcribed by outside observers.&lt;ref name="Seeking Bāuls of Bengal"/&gt;

There are two classes of Bauls: [[asceticism|ascetic]] Bauls who reject family life and Bauls who live with their families. Ascetic Bauls renounce family life and society and survive on alms. They have no fixed dwelling place, but move from one akhda to another. Men wear white [[lungi]]s and long, white tunics; women wear white [[sari]]s. They carry ''jhola''s, shoulder bags for alms. They do not beget or rear children. They are treated as ''jyante mara'' or [[dalit]]s. Women dedicated to the service of ascetics, are known as ''sevadasi''s "service slaves". A male Baul can have one or more ''sevadasi''s, who are associated with him in the act of devotion. Until 1976 the district of Kushtia had 252 ascetic Bauls. In 1982-83 the number rose to 905; in 2000, they numbered about 5000.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Those who choose family life live with their spouse, children and relations in a secluded part of a village. They do not mix freely with other members of the community. Unlike ascetic Bauls, their rituals are less strict. In order to become Bauls, they recite some mystic verses and observe certain rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Karim |first=Anwarul |year=2012 |chapter=Baul |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Baul |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baul music celebrates celestial love, but does this in very earthy terms, as in declarations of love by the Baul for his bosh-tomi or lifemate.
With such a liberal interpretation of love, it is only natural that Baul devotional music transcends religion and some of the most famous baul composers, such as [[Lalon]], criticised the superficiality of religious divisions:

{{quote|Everyone asks: "Lalan, what's your religion in this world?"&lt;br /&gt;
Lalan answers: "How does religion look?"&lt;br /&gt;
I've never laid eyes on it.&lt;br /&gt;
Some wear malas [Hindu rosaries] around their necks,&lt;br /&gt;
some tasbis [Muslim rosaries], and so people say&lt;br /&gt;
they've got different religions.&lt;br /&gt;
But do you bear the sign of your religion&lt;br /&gt;

The famous Bengali poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]] was greatly influenced and inspired by Bauls. Here is a famous ''[[Rabindra Sangeet]]'' heavily influenced by Baul theme:

{{quote|''amar praner manush achhe prane''&lt;br /&gt;
''tai here taye shokol khane''&lt;br /&gt;
''Achhe she noyōn-taray, alōk-dharay, tai na haraye--''&lt;br /&gt;
''ogo tai dekhi taye Jethay shethay''&lt;br /&gt;
''taka-i ami je dik-pane''

The man of my heart dwells inside me.&lt;br /&gt;
Everywhere I look, it is he.&lt;br /&gt;
In my every sight, in the sparkle of light&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, I can never lose him--&lt;br /&gt;
Here, there and everywhere,&lt;br /&gt;
Wherever I turn, he is right there!{{cn|date=October 2018}}}}

Their religion is based on an expression of the body (''deho sādhana''), and an expression of the mind (''mana sādhana''). Some of their rituals are kept hidden{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} from outsiders, as they might be thought to be repulsive or hedonistic. Bauls concentrate much of their mystic energies on the four body fluids, on the nine-doors (openings of the body), on [[prakṛti]] as "nature" or "primal motive force", and on breath [[sādhana]].

==Music==
[[Image:394 baul-singers-sml.jpg|thumb|Baul singers at Vasantotsav, [[Santiniketan]] in West Bengal]]
[[File:Parvati Baul.JPG|thumb|left|[[Parvathy Baul]] in [[Kolkata]]]]
The music of the Bauls, ''Baul Sangeet'', is a particular type of folk song. Its lyrics carry influences of the [[Hindu]] [[bhakti movement]]s and the ''suphi'', a form of [[Sufi]] song exemplified by the songs of [[Kabir]]. Their music represents a long heritage of preaching mysticism through songs in [[Bengal]], as in the Shahebdhoni or Bolahadi sects.

Bauls pour out their feelings in their songs but never bother to write them down. Theirs is essentially an oral tradition. It is said that [[Lalon]] Fokir (1774 -1890), the greatest of all Bauls, continued to compose and sing songs for decades without ever stopping to correct them or put them on paper. It was only after his death that people thought of collecting and compiling his repertoire.

Their lyrics intertwine a deep sense of mysticism, a longing for oneness with the divine. An important part of their philosophy is "Deha tatta", a spirituality related to the body rather than the mind. They seek the divinity in human beings. Metaphysical topics are dwelt upon humbly and in simple words. They stress remaining unattached and unconsumed by the pleasures of life even while enjoying them. To them we are all a gift of divine power and the body is a temple, music being the path to connect to that power.&lt;ref name="about1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hinduism.about.com/od/artculture/a/bauls.htm|title=Bauls of Bengal|date=10 April 2012|website=Hinduism.about.com|accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emahomagazine1"&gt;{{cite web |author=Music |url=http://www.emahomagazine.com/2011/07/bauls-of-bengal-liberation-seekers/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120729054639/http://www.emahomagazine.com/2011/07/bauls-of-bengal-liberation-seekers/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 July 2012 |title=Bauls of Bengal&amp;nbsp;– The Liberation Seekers |publisher=Emaho Magazine |date=26 July 2011 |accessdate=2012-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A consistent part of Bauls' lyrics deals with body-centered practices that aim at controlling sexual desire. The esoteric knowledge of conception and contraception is revealed in the lyrics of the songs through an enigmatic language that needs to be decoded by the guru in order to be understood and experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lorea|first=Carola|date=2014|title=“Why do you go swimming in the river full of algae? Conception and contraception in Baul songs and oral teachings”|url=https://www.academia.edu/8257095/Folklore_and_Folkloristics_peer_reviewed_online_international_journal_|journal=Journal of Folklore and Folkloristics|volume=7.1|pages=9-45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides traditional motifs drawn from the rural everyday life, Baul songs have always been inclined to incorporate change and keep pace with social and economic innovations. For instance, modern Baul compositions discuss esoteric matters by using the terminology of modern, urban and technological lexicons, and it is not unusual to hear Baul refrains containing mobile phones, radio channels, football matches and television.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lorea|first=Carola Erika|date=January 2014|title=Searching for the Divine, Handling Mobile Phones|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/2230807513506629|journal=History and Sociology of South Asia|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=59–88|doi=10.1177/2230807513506629|issn=2230-8075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bauls use a number of musical instruments: the most common is the ''[[ektara]]'', a one-stringed "plucked drum" drone instrument, carved from the epicarp of a gourd, and made of bamboo and goatskin. Others include the ''[[dotara]]'', a long-necked fretless lute (while the name literally means "two stringed" it usually has four metal strings) made of the wood of a jackfruit or neem tree; besides ''[[khamak]]'', one-headed drum with a string attached to it which is plucked. The only difference from ektara is that no bamboo is used to stretch the string, which is held by one hand, while being plucked by another.&lt;ref name="Barthakur2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dilip Ranjan Barthakur|title=The Music And Musical Instruments Of North Eastern India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oP4vH-4oSEcC&amp;pg=PA130|accessdate=14 July 2013|year=2003|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-81-7099-881-5|pages=130–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drums like the [[duggi (drum)|duggi]], a small hand-held earthen drum,  and ''[[dhol]]'' and ''[[khol]]''; small cymbals called ''[[khartal]]'' and ''[[manjira]]'', and the bamboo flute are also used. ''Ghungur'' and  ''nupur'' are anklets with bells that ring while the person wearing them dances.

== Bhaba Pagla ==
[[File:Bhaba Pagla.jpg|thumb|A picture of the saint-composer Bhaba Pagla, worshipped by his devotees in West Bengal and Bangladesh. Photo credit: Carola Erika Lorea.]]
[[Bhaba Pagla]] (1902-1984) was a famous saint-composer and an important guru from East Bengal. He has been a spiritual preceptor for many Bauls and his songs are very popular among Baul performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/950430793|title=Folklore, religion and the songs of a Bengali madman : a journey between performance and the politics of cultural representation|last=1987-|first=Lorea, Carola Erika,|isbn=9789004324701|location=Leiden|oclc=950430793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rabindranath Tagore==
The songs of the Bauls and their lifestyle influenced a large swath of Bengali culture, but nowhere did it leave its imprint more powerfully than on the work of [[Rabindranath Tagore]], who talked of Bauls in a number of speeches in Europe in the 1930s.  An essay based on these was compiled into his English book ''[[The Religion of Man]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Bauls are an ancient group of wandering minstrels from Bengal, who believe in simplicity in life and love. They are similar to the Buddhists in their belief in a fulfillment which is reached by love's emancipating us from the dominance of self.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Baul Santiniketan.jpg|left|275px|thumb|Baul singers in performance at [[Santiniketan]], India.]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Where shall I meet him, the Man of my Heart?&lt;br /&gt;
 He is lost to me and I seek him wandering from land to land. &lt;br /&gt;
: I am listless for that moonrise of beauty,
:: which is to light my life,
:: which I long to see in the fullness of vision
:: in gladness of heart. [p.524]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The above is a translation of the famous Baul song by [[Gagan Harkara]]: Ami kothai pabo tare, amar moner manush je re. The following extract is a translation of another song:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 My longing is to meet you in play of love, my Lover;&lt;br /&gt;
 But this longing is not only mine, but also yours.&lt;br /&gt;
 For your lips can have their smile, and your flute&lt;br /&gt;
: its music, only in your delight in my love;
: and therefore you importunate, even as I am.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The poet proudly says: 'Your flute could not have its music of beauty if your delight were not in my love. Your power is great—and there I am not equal to you—but it lies even in me to make you smile and if you and I never meet, then this play of love remains incomplete.'

The great distinguished people of the world do not know that these beggars—deprived of education, honour and wealth—can, in the pride of their souls, look down upon them as the unfortunate ones who are left on the shore for their worldly uses but whose life ever
misses the touch of the Lover's arms.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

This feeling that man is not a mere casual visitor at the palace-gate of the world, but the invited guest whose presence is needed to give the royal banquet its sole meaning, is not confined to any particular sect in India.

A large tradition in medieval devotional poetry from Rajasthan and other parts of India also bear the same message of unity in celestial and romantic love and that divine love can be fulfilled only through its human beloved.

Tagore's own compositions were powerfully influenced by Baul ideology. His music also bears the stamp of many Baul tunes. Other Bengali poets, such as [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], have also been influenced by Baul music and its message of non-sectarian devotion through love.

[[Rabindranath Tagore]] was greatly influenced and inspired by Bauls. Here is a famous '''Rabindrasangeet''' (Tagore song), heavily influenced by Baul theme:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Amar praner manush achhé prané &lt;br /&gt;
Tai heri taye sakol khane &lt;br /&gt;
Achhe shé nayōntaray, alōk-dharay, tai na haraye-- &lt;br /&gt;
: Ogo tai dekhi taye jethay sethay
: Taka-i ami jé dik-pané
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The man of my heart dwells inside me. &lt;br /&gt;
Everywhere I behold, it's Him! &lt;br /&gt;
In my every sight, in the sparkle of light &lt;br /&gt;
: Oh I can never lose Him --
: Here, there and everywhere,
: Wherever I turn, right in front is He!&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/19419965/Bauls-of-Bangladesh] "Bauls of Bangladesh". www.scribd.com&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
All bāulas shared only one belief in common—that God is hidden within the heart of man and neither priest, prophet, nor the ritual of any organized religion will help one to find Him there. They felt that both temple and mosque block the path to truth; the search for God must be carried out individually and independently.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;Edward C. Dimock, Jr., "Rabindranath Tagore—’The Greatest of the Bāuls of Bengal,’" The Journal of Asian Studies (Ann Arbor, Mich.: Association for Asian Studies), vol. 19, no. 1 (Nov. 1959), 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As described by Ramakrishna==
From page 513 of the [[Sri Sri Ramakrishna Kathamrita]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
According to the Sakti cult the siddha is called a koul, and according to the Vedanta, a paramahamsa. The Bauls call him a sai. They say, "No one is greater than a sai." The sai is a man of supreme perfection. He doesn't see any differentiation in the world. He wears a necklace, one half made of cow bones and the other of the sacred tulsi-plant. He calls the Ultimate Truth "Alekh", the "Incomprehensible One". The Vedas call it "Brahman". About the jivas the Bauls say, "They come from Alekh and they go unto Alekh." That is to say, the individual soul has come from the Unmanifest and goes back to the Unmanifest. The Bauls will ask you, "Do you know about the wind?" The "wind" means the great current that one feels in the subtle nerves, Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna, when the Kundalini is awakened. They will ask you further, "In which station are you dwelling?" According to them there are six "stations", corresponding to the six psychic centers of Yoga. If they say that a man dwells in the "fifth station", it means that his mind has climbed to the fifth centre, known as the Visuddha chakra. (To Mahendranath Gupta) At that time he sees the Formless.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Present status==
[[File:Paban Das Baul at Nine Lives concert, 2009.jpg|right|210px|thumb|[[Paban Das Baul]] at "Nine Lives" concert, 2009]]
Bauls are found in the Indian state of [[West Bengal]] and the eastern parts of [[Bihar]] and [[Jharkhand]] and the country of [[Bangladesh]]. The Baul movement was at its peak in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but even today one comes across the occasional Baul with his ''[[Ektara]]'' (one-stringed musical instrument) and begging bowl, singing across the farflung villages of rural Bengal. Travelling in local trains and attending village fairs are good ways to encounter Bauls.

Every year, in the month of [[Falgun]] (February to March), "Lalon Smaran Utshab" (Lalon memorial festival) is held in the shrine of Lalon in [[Kushtia]], Bangladesh, where bauls and devotees of Lalon from Bangladesh and overseas come to perform and highlight the mystics of Lalon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aman |first=Amanur |date=13 March 2012 |title=Lalon Smaran Utshab ends |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=226004 |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palli Baul Samaj Unnayan Sangstha (PBSUS), a Bangladeshi organisation, has been working to uphold and preserve the ‘baul’ traditions and philosophy for the last nine years. The organisation often arranges programmes featuring folk songs for urban audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=info@banglamusic.com |url=http://banglamusic.com/news/baul-mela-2009-2245.html |title=Baul Mela 2009 Bangla Music&amp;nbsp;– Bangla Song Bangla Video Bengali Music Mp3 News |publisher=Banglamusic.com |date=20 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018181927/http://banglamusic.com/news/baul-mela-2009-2245.html |archive-date=2014-10-18 |accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shilpakala Academy|Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy]] often organises national and international festivals and seminars, featuring the Baul music and the importance of preservation of Baul tradition.

In the village of [[Jaydev Kenduli]], a [[Mela]] (fair) is organised in memory of the poet [[Jayadeva]] on the occasion of [[Makar Sankranti]] in the month of [[Poush]]. So many Bauls assemble for the mela that it is also referred to as "Baul Fair".

In the village of [[Shantiniketan]] during [[Poush Mela]], numerous Bauls also come together to enthrall people with their music.

For the last five years a unique show has been organised in [[Kolkata]], called "Baul Fakir Utsav". Bauls from several districts of Bengal as well as Bangladesh come to perform. The 6th Baul fakir Utsav will be held on 8 and 9 January 2011. The Utsav is a continuous 48-hour musical experience.

There are also the Western Bauls in America and Europe under the spiritual direction of [[Lee Lozowick]], a student of [[Yogi Ramsuratkumar]]. Their music is quite different (rock /gospel/ blues) but the essence of the spiritual practices of the East is well maintained.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Crovetto, "Embodied Knowledge and Divinity: The Hohm Community as Western-style Bāuls," ''Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent  Religions'' 10, no. 1 (August 2006): pp. 69-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bangalore near Electronic City Dr. Shivshankar Bhattacharjee has started Boul Sammelon (Gathering of Baulls) on 7–9 April-2017 on the occasion of the inauguration of Sri Sri Kali Bari (Goodness Kali's Temple). First time it held in Bangalore to embrace the Boul culture. More that 50 Bouls participated and sang soulful songs.

Currently another version of Baul called the folk fusion also called baul rock is also greatly accepted by the audience, especially in West Bengal. [[Kartik das baul]] being a traditional folk singer, who has taken baul to different heights is being associated with folk fusion. This type of baul was brought into the world of music by [[Bolepur bluez]], which was world's first folk fusion band.

The creation of art in the geographic area now known as [[Brazil]] begins with the earliest records of its human habitation. The original inhabitants of the land, [[pre-Columbian]] Indian peoples, produced various forms of art; specific cultures like the [[Marajoara]] left sophisticated painted [[pottery]]. This area was colonized by [[Portugal]] in the 16th century and given the modern name of [[Brazil]]. '''Brazilian art''' is most commonly used as an umbrella term for art created in this region post Portuguese colonization.

==Pre-Columbian traditions==
{{main|Indigenous peoples in Brazil}}
The oldest known art in Brazil is the [[cave painting]]s in [[Serra da Capivara National Park]] in the state of [[Piauí]],&lt;ref&gt;''Almanaque Abril 2007''. São Paulo: Editora Abril, 2007, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; dating back to c. 13,000 BC. More recent examples have been found in [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Goiás]], showing geometric patterns and animal forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historiadaarte.com.br/prehistoriabras.html Martins, Simone B. &amp; Imbroisi, Margaret H. ''História da Arte'', 1988] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031010548/http://historiadaarte.com.br/prehistoriabras.html |date=2010-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most sophisticated kinds of Pre-Columbian artifact found in Brazil is the sophisticated [[Marajoara]] pottery (c.  800–1400 AD), from cultures flourishing on [[Marajó Island]] and around the region of [[Santarém, Brazil|Santarém]], decorated with painting and complex human and animal reliefs. Statuettes and cult objects, such as the small carved-stone amulets called [[muiraquitã]]s, also belong to these cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Correa, Conceição Gentil. ''Estatuetas de cerâmica na cultura Santarém''. Belém: Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mina culture|Mina]] and [[Periperi]] cultures, from [[Maranhão]] and [[Bahia]], produced interesting though simpler pottery and statuettes.

In the beginning of the 21st century, the ancient Indian traditions of [[body painting]], pottery, cult statuettes, and feather art are still being cultivated by the remaining Indian peoples.

==Baroque==
{{main|Baroque in Brazil}}
The first Western artists active in Brazil were [[Roman Catholic]] priests who came from Portugal to “civilize” the Indians. [[Jesuit]]s assumed an important role in this process, with their many missionary establishments called "[[Reductions]]" teaching religion through art in the form of sacred plays, music, statuary, and painting. [[José de Anchieta]] was the first important playwright; [[Agostinho de Jesus]] and [[Agostinho da Piedade]] produced the first known sculptures; [[Belchior Paulo]], [[João Felipe Bettendorff]], [[Ricardo do Pilar]], and a few others did the first paintings; while [[Francisco de Vaccas]] and Pedro da Fonseca started organizing the musical life of the infant colony. [[Basílio da Gama]] and [[Gregório de Mattos]] were the first secular poets. All of them worked under the influence of the [[Baroque]], the dominant style in Brazil until the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;KARNAL, Leandro.

Encyclopaedia Itaú Cultural]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 17th and 18th centuries Baroque art flourished with increasing richness and craftsmanship, mainly in [[Bahia]] and [[Pernambuco]] along the coast and in some inland regions, reaching the highest levels of originality in [[Minas Gerais]], where a [[gold rush]] nurtured a rich and cultured local society. In Minas lived the greatest artists of Brazilian Baroque: [[Painting|painter]] [[Manuel da Costa Ataíde]] and [[sculptor]]-[[architect]] [[Aleijadinho]]. Minas was also the birthplace of a proto-[[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] school of [[music]] and [[literature]], with composers [[Lobo de Mesquita]] and [[Francisco Gomes da Rocha]], and poets [[Tomás Antônio Gonzaga]] and [[Cláudio Manuel da Costa]].&lt;ref name="itaucultural.org.br" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MARIZ, Vasco.

==19th century: Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Realism==
{{See also|Academic art in Brazil}}
One single event in the 19th century sowed the seeds for a complete renewal in Brazilian visual arts: the arrival of the [[Missão Artística Francesa|French Artistic Mission]] in 1816, which strongly reinforced the Neoclassical style, previously seen in Brazil only in timid attempts. [[Joachim Lebreton]], its leader, proposed the creation of an Academy of Fine Arts, later restructured as the [[Imperial Academy of Fine Arts (Brazil)|Imperial Academy of Fine Arts]]. The Academy was the most important center for the [[visual arts]] through nearly the whole of the 19th century. It imposed a new concept of artistic education and was the basis for a revolution in Brazilian painting, sculpture, architecture, graphic arts, and crafts.&lt;ref&gt;CONDURU, Roberto. ''Araras Gregas''. In: 19&amp;20 - A revista eletrônica de DezenoveVinte. Volume III, n. 2, abril de 2008 [http://www.dezenovevinte.net/arte%20decorativa/ad_conduru.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; A few decades later, under the personal patronage of Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], who was engaged in an ambitious national project of modernization, the Academy reached its golden age, fostering the emergence of the first generation of Romantic painters. [[Victor Meirelles]] and [[Pedro Américo]], among others, produced lasting visual symbols of national identity. It must be said that in Brazil Romanticism in painting took a peculiar shape, not showing the overwhelming dramaticism, fantasy, violence, or interest in death and the bizarre commonly seen in the European version, and because of its academic and palatial nature all excesses were eschewed.&lt;ref&gt;BISCARDI, Afrânio &amp; ROCHA, Frederico Almeida.

[[File:Independence of Brazil 1888.jpg|thumb|250px|Pedro Américo: ''[[Independence or Death (painting)|Independence or Death!]]'', 1888. [[Museu Paulista]]]]

Meanwhile, literature too evolved towards a romantic-nationalist school with the works of [[Casimiro de Abreu]] and [[Manuel Antônio de Almeida]]. Around 1850, a transition began, centered upon [[Álvares de Azevedo]], who was influenced by the poetry of [[Lord Byron]]. This second generation of Romantics was obsessed with morbidness and death, and soon after, social commentary could be found in literature, both features not seen in the visual arts. [[Antônio Castro Alves]] wrote of the horrors of [[slavery]], and the persecuted Indians were rescued through art by poets and novelists like [[Antônio Gonçalves Dias]] and [[José de Alencar]]. These trends combined in one of the most important accomplishments of the Romantic era in Brazil: the establishment of a Brazilian national identity based on Indian ancestry and the rich natural environment of the country.&lt;ref&gt;''O Indianismo como Projeto de Nacionalidade''. Secretaria Municipal de Educação - Prefeitura da Cidade do Rio de Janeiro [http://www.multirio.rj.gov.br/historia/modulo02/tema65_1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In music, the 19th century produced only two composers of outstanding talent: neoclassical sacred composer [[José Maurício Nunes Garcia]], for a while [[music director]] to the court, and later, Romantic [[Opera|operist]] [[Antônio Carlos Gomes|Carlos Gomes]], the first Brazilian musician to win international acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;''A Música na Corte de D. João VI e D. Pedro I; Antonio Carlos Gomes''. In MARIZ, Vasco. ''História da Música no Brasil''. Rio de Janeiro: Nova Fronteira, 2005.pp 52-61; 76-95&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, Brazilian art became acquainted with [[Realism (arts)|Realism]]. Descriptions of nature and of the people of Brazil's varied regions as well as psychological romances proliferated with [[João Simões Lopes Neto]], [[Aluísio Azevedo]], [[Euclides da Cunha]], and, above all, [[Machado de Assis]], while [[Almeida Junior]], [[Pedro Weingärtner]], [[Oscar Pereira da Silva]], and other Realist painters depicted folk types and the distinctive colors and light of Brazilian landscape.

==20th century: Modern Art==

The beginning of the 20th century saw a struggle between old schools and modernist trends. The [[Week of Modern Art]] festival, held in [[São Paulo]] in 1922, was received with fiery criticism by conservative  sectors of the society, but it was a landmark in the history of Brazilian art. It included plastic arts exhibitions, lectures, concerts, and the reading of poems. Due to the radicalism (for the times) of some of their poems and music, the artists were vigorously booed and pelted by the audience, and the press and art critics in general were strong in their condemnation. However, those artists are now seen as the founders of Modern art in Brazil. Modernist literature and theory of art were represented by [[Oswald de Andrade]], [[Sérgio Milliet]], [[Menotti del Picchia]], and [[Mário de Andrade]], whose revolutionary novel ''[[Macunaíma (novel)|Macunaíma]]'' (1928) is one of the founding texts of Brazilian Modernism. Painting was represented by [[Anita Malfatti]], [[Tarsila do Amaral]], [[Emiliano Di Cavalcanti]], [[Lasar Segall]], [[Vicente do Rego Monteiro]]; sculpture by [[Victor Brecheret]]; and music by [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], the leader of a new musical nationalism, among many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitoresco.com.br/art_data/semana/ ''Semana da Arte Moderna''. Pitoresco Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414025546/http://www.pitoresco.com.br/art_data/semana/ |date=2010-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brazil.Brasilia.01.jpg|thumb|250px|Oscar Niemeyer: [[Cathedral of Brasília]]. The statues are works by [[Alfredo Ceschiatti]]]]
The Week not only introduced to a wider public modern, experimental tendencies derived from European [[Expressionism]], [[Cubism]], and [[Surrealism]], but also wanted to make use of national [[folklore]] as a basis for an art more relevant to the Brazilian reality, with an enhanced social awareness. This "cannibalization" of european movements and transformation into genuine brazilian expression is the motto between the [[Manifesto Antropófago|Anthropophagic Manifesto]], published by Oswald de Andrade in 1928, that draws parallels between art history and the cannibal rituals of the Tupi people.

However, the radicalism of those first Modernists couldn't last for long in a society used to traditional fashions, and the original core members had separated by 1929, pursuing individual paths. What Brazilian art then became was a mix of some important achievements of the Moderns, meaning freedom from the strict academic agenda, with more conventional traits, giving birth in the following generation to a moderate Modernism, best exemplified by painter [[Cândido Portinari]], who was something like the official painter of the Brazilian government in mid-century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itaucultural.org.br/aplicexternas/enciclopedia_ic/index.cfm?fuseaction=termos_texto_ing&amp;cd_verbete=4900&amp;lst_palavras=&amp;cd_idioma=28556&amp;cd_item=8 ''Modernism in Brazil''. Encyclopedia Itaú Cultural]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Copan ST.jpg|thumb|181x181px|left|''Oscar Niemeyer: ''Copan Building'']]

Within the group of Brazilian artists, Chico Niedzielski's artwork has been spread all over the country. His work is known to be inspired by Sacred Geometry, breaking the tendency to focus on Brazilian themes and searching for a more universal and atemporal form of [http://chiconiedzielski.com Brazilian art].
The erosion of radical Modernism in the visual arts in the early 20th century was not reflected in Brazilian literature. [[Clarice Lispector]] wrote [[Existentialism|existentialist]] novels and developed a highly personal style, filled with [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] and epiphanies. [[João Guimarães Rosa]] changed the face of Brazilian literature with his experimental language, and playwright [[Nelson Rodrigues]] dealt with crime, prejudice, passion, and sexual pathologies. In the 1950s, painting and sculpture regained strength through [[Abstractionism]], and architecture began also to display advanced features, influenced by [[Le Corbusier]]. Its greatest achievement was the urban core of [[Brasília]], designed by urbanist [[Lúcio Costa]] and architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]], now a [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itaucultural.org.br/aplicexternas/enciclopedia_ic/index.cfm?fuseaction=artistas_biografia_ing&amp;cd_verbete=3948&amp;lst_palavras=&amp;cd_idioma=28556&amp;cd_item=1 ''Niemeyer, Oscar''. Encyclopedia Itaú Cultural]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== 1960s onwards: Contemporary Art ==
Around the 1960s, the so-called "modernist" art movements started giving way to most contemporary means of expression, such as appropriation, political art, [[Conceptual art]] and [[Pop art|Pop]]. Right at the turn of the decade, some Brazilian [[Concrete art|Concrete]] artists began ditching the traditional "strictness" of concrete art in favor of a more phenomenological approach, exploring the relations between the art object and the viewer. Among the primary leaders of this [[Neo-Concrete Movement|Neo-Concrete movement]] were the poet [[Ferreira Gullar]], and the visual artists [[Hélio Oiticica]], [[Lygia Pape]] and [[Lygia Clark]], this last one internationally cited as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/most-influential-artists-1093196|title=Who Are the Most Influential Artists of the Last Century? 26 Industry Leaders Weigh In {{!}} artnet News|date=2017-10-13|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|Coup d'état of 1964]] and subsequential takeaway of civil rights and freedom of expression in Brazil is commonly marked as the shifting point, whence artists such as [[Cildo Meireles]] and [[Rubens Gerchman]] began creating explicitly political art &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://memoriasdaditadura.org.br/artes-plasticas/index.html|title=Artes plásticas na ditadura - Memórias da ditadura|date=2014-11-14|work=Memórias da ditadura|access-date=2018-04-27|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Particularly after 1968, when the military government legalized torture, brazilian art was marked by rather radical actions and [[Happening|happenings]]. The [[São Paulo Art Biennial]], the second oldest art biennial in the world, opened up with most of its walls empty due to a boycott from the artists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bienal.org.br/post.php?i=537|title=O boicote à Bienal de 1969 - Bienal|last=Paulo|first=Bienal São|website=www.bienal.org.br|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; . In 1970, the exhibit Do Corpo à Terra ("From Body to Earth") took place in [[Belo Horizonte]], and included rather shocking actions such as Cildo Meireles setting live chickens on fire in front of a live audience&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://memoriasdaditadura.org.br/obras/tiradentes-totem-monumento-ao-preso-politico-1970-de-cildo-meireles/index.html|title=Tiradentes – Totem-monumento ao Preso Político (1970), de Cildo Meireles - Memórias da ditadura|work=Memórias da ditadura|access-date=2018-04-27|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Artur Barrio]] ditching blood-soaked packages in a river, giving off the impression that the people who disappeared under the military government had "reappeared" in this gruesome fashion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53099013|title=Inverted utopias : avant-garde art in Latin America|last=1955-|first=Ramírez, Mari Carmen,|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|others=Olea, Héctor., Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.|isbn=0300102690|location=New Haven|oclc=53099013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Brazilian [[Pop art]] didn't come without its share of criticism, sometimes adopting an outright rejection of consumer culture instead of the ambivalent, distant criticism of american pop. [[Waldemar Cordeiro]] is one of the most expressive artists that began exploring digital art and robotics in its work around the 60s and 70s, while Antonio Dias, Carlos Vergara brought the aethetics of comic books, playing cards and other popular forms of visuality into his work. Hélio Oiticica's "Tropicália", a colorful immersive installation piece, incorporated references to the slums of Rio de Janeiro. The title relates to the [[Tropicália|cultural movement of the same name]], that called back to the Antropophagic Manifesto of the 1920s to offer a more tongue-in-cheek perspective on the myths of an exotic and "wild" Brazil.

Some artists as: [[Hélio Oiticica]], [[Lygia Clark]], [[Naza (artist)|Naza]], [[Cildo Meireles]] among others, have been featured on the international stage. Brazilian contemporary art and photography are among the most creative in Latin America, growing an international prominence each year with exhibitions and publications. Names like Miguel Rio Branco, [[Vik Muniz]], [[Sebastião Salgado]], [[Guy Veloso]], and others, get strong.

The '''Cancionero de Medinaceli''' or '''Cancionero Musical de Medinaceli''' (CMM) is a [[manuscript]] containing [[Spanish music]] of the [[Renaissance]]. It was copied during the second half of the 16th century and kept at the library of the [[Duke of Medinaceli]]'s house, hence its name. Is it probably the most important compilation of Spanish secular [[polyphony]] of the Renaissance after the [[Cancionero de Palacio]].

Pearson, Ph.D. {{!}} Author {{!}} The Hero Within|website=www.carolspearson.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''Carol S. Pearson''' is an author and educator. She develops new theories and models with an applied practical bent, building on the work of psychiatrist [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]], psychoanalyst [[James Hillman]], mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], and other [[Depth psychology|depth psychologists]].

Pearson is best known as the author of ''The Hero Within: Six Archetypes We Live By'' (1986, 1989, 1998), which was a [[HarperCollins|HarperSanFrancisco]] best-seller, followed by the more expansive ''Awakening the Heroes Within: Twelve Archetypes to Help Us Find Ourselves and Transform Our World'' (1991)''.'' With the assistance of Hugh Marr, she co-created the Pearson-Marr Archetype Indicator (PMAI), published by the Center for Applications of Psychological Type (CAPT), to help people better understand their motivations, their unconscious assumptions, and the narratives they think, tell, and live.

Her most recent book,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carolspearson.com/publications/persephone-rising-awakening-the-heroine-within/|title=Persephone Rising: Awakening the Heroine Within {{!}} Carol S. Pearson, Ph.D. {{!}} Author {{!}} The Hero Within|website=www.carolspearson.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;''Persephone Rising: Awakening The Heroine Within'', published in October 2015, bridges the genres of [[depth psychology]], myth scholarship, and [[memoir]]. It draws on archetypal stories from an ancient [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Greek mystery religion]] as a guide to thriving today in a world in flux. It concludes with an analysis of narrative intelligence as an important aspect of emotional intelligence that also builds cognitive complexity. In April 2016, ''Persephone Rising'' received a gold medal from the [[Nautilus Book Awards]] in the category of books for women.

In addition to such books written for the general public, Pearson has made major contributions to the fields of education, marketing and branding, organizational development, and leadership through publications such as ''Educating the Majority: Women Challenge Tradition in Higher Education'', co-editors, Donna L. Shavlik and Judith G. Touchton (1989); ''The Hero and the Outlaw: Building Extraordinary Brands Through the Power of Archetypes'', co-author, Margaret Mark (2001); ''Mapping the Organizational Psyche: A Jungian Theory of Organizational Dynamics and Change'', co-author, John G. Corlett (2004); and ''The Transforming Leader: New Approaches to Leadership for the Twenty-First Century'' (2012).

She designed the Organizational and Team Culture Indicator, also published by CAPT, to help organizational development and human resource professionals and marketers understand organizational cultures. [[Kenexa]], a global human resources company, bought the OTCI instrument from CAPT. [[IBM]] later acquired Kenexa and translated the instrument for global use. It is now known as the IBM Kenexa Organizational Cultural Insight Survey.

==Early life and education==

Pearson was born in [[Chicago]] in 1944, the eldest child of Thelma (Widman) and John A. Pearson. At the age of two, she moved with her family to [[Houston|Houston, TX]], where she attended Houston public schools and later [http://www.rice.edu Rice University], from which she received a BA (1966), MA, (1968), and PhD (1970). She has one younger sibling, John Douglas Pearson. She is married to David R. Merkowitz, a political and public affairs consultant, and has two step-children,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdfifund.gov/about/Pages/Staff-and-Board.aspx|title=Staff &amp; Board|website=www.cdfifund.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey Merkowitz, who works at the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Department of the Treasury]], and &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sed/bio/stephen.m.merkowitz|title=Bio - Dr. Stephen M Merkowitz|website=science.gsfc.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Merkowitz, a gravitational physicist at [[Goddard Space Flight Center|NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center]], and a daughter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://web.uri.edu/politicalscience/meet/shanna-pearson-merkowitz/|title=Shanna Pearson-Merkowitz - department of political science|work=department of political science|access-date=2017-04-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shanna Pearson-Merkowitz, a political science professor at the [[University of Rhode Island]], as well as six grandchildren.

Pearson began her study of archetypal theory and narrative intelligence in the [http://english.rice.edu/home/ English Department at Rice University], which emphasized the myth/symbol school of [[Literary criticism|literary studies]]. Later in her career, she earned a [[Doctor of Ministry]] degree from [http://www.wisdomuniversity.org Wisdom University (2012)], a graduate school originally called the University of Creation Spirituality, and now a part of Ubiquity University, that explores the progressive mystic traditions in religions throughout the world. She also holds an honorary [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] degree from [http://www.norwich.edu Norwich University.]

== Academic career ==
Pearson’s academic career began with a series of faculty positions in the 1970s. First hired as an assistant professor in the [http://www.colorado.edu/academics/programs/english English Department at the University of Colorado], she was selected as the founding director of the CU Women Studies Program and was instrumental in developing ''[https://frontiers.osu.edu Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies]'', one of the earliest academic journals in the field. She subsequently was recruited to be the first director of the [http://wmst.umd.edu Women’s Studies Program at the University of Maryland, College Park], where she negotiated to bring the offices of the [http://www.nwsa.org National Women's Studies Association] and the journal ''[[Feminist Studies]]'' to the campus.

During her tenure at UMD, Pearson was selected to be a fellow in the American Council on Education Fellows Program, the nation’s premier higher education leadership development program. She spent her fellowship year at the [http://www.uncc.edu University of North Carolina at Charlotte], working with the chancellor of the university and other senior administrators. Upon returning to UMD, she accepted an invitation to spend part of her time as a visiting scholar at the [http://www.acenet.edu/leadership/programs/Pages/ACE-Fellows-Program.aspx American Council on Education’s] Center for Leadership Development. She also worked with ACE’s Office of Women in Higher Education to develop “The New Agenda of Women for Higher Education.”

As Pearson moved into leadership positions, she began to explore leadership studies scholarship. She worked at two women’s colleges, serving first as Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of [http://www.goucher.edu Goucher College] in Towson, MD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/06/science/education-women-s-college-faces-the-inevitable-men.html|title=WOMEN'S COLLEGE FACES THE INEVITABLE: MEN|date=6 May 1986|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later as Dean of the Mount Vernon Institute at [http://www.mvnu.edu Mount Vernon College] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]]. From 1998 to 2005, Pearson was Senior Editor of ''The Inner Edge: A Resource for Enlightened Business Practice'', published bi-monthly by InnoVision Communications''',''' and then the Director of the Transformational Leadership Certificate Program at the Center for Professional Development at Georgetown University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scs.georgetown.edu/programs_nc/CE0127/transformational-leadership?gclid=CPeFj4mD3NICFcSKswodnNYHEQ|title=Executive Certificate in Transformational Leadership|publisher=Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies|website=scs.georgetown.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, she also was President of [https://greatnonprofits.org/org/meristem Meristem], a nonprofit education and training organization.

From 2005 to 2009, Pearson served as Director of the [[James MacGregor Burns|James MacGregor Burns Academy of Leadership]] in the School of Public Policy at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]. The academy incubated the International Leadership Association, of which she was a member of the board of directors. She also co-led a Leadership for Transformation project, out of which grew her edited volume ''The Transforming Leader'', which was honored by the International Leadership Association at its 2014 global conference for making a significant contribution to the field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ila-net.org/conferences/2014/2014-ILA-program.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Pearson left UMD to take a position as Executive Vice President and Provost at [http://www.pacifica.edu Pacifica Graduate Institute] in [[Carpinteria, California]], later becoming the school’s President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/10/prweb8859261.htm|title=Pacifica Graduate Institute Welcomes New President, Establishes Chancellor Position|work=prweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacifica offers graduate degrees in Jungian and archetypal studies, psychology, mythology, and several other fields. Since leaving Pacifica in 2013, Pearson has continued to write, teach, consult, and lead workshops, but has retired from academic leadership.

Pearson’s current interests have expanded from exploring archetypes in organizations and individuals to their role in social systems. In 2009, she wrote a monograph for the [[Fetzer Institute]], called &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fetzer.org/sites/default/files/images/resources/attachment/2012-07-12/dad_pearson_essay.pdf|title=Maturing the American Dream|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maturing the American Dream, which identified archetypes in U.S. culture and their likely implications for the future. Most recently, [http://www.carolspearson.com/blog/ Pearson’s blogs] and other social media communications have explored the interface between archetypal patterns in individuals and larger social groups as well as more general philosophical and psycho-spiritual issues.

The '''Coalition for Networked Information''' ('''CNI''') is an organization whose mission is to promote networked [[information technology]] as a way to further the advancement of intellectual collaboration and productivity.

==Overview==
The Coalition for Networked Information (CNI), a joint initiative of the [[Association of Research Libraries]] (ARL) and [[EDUCAUSE]], promotes the use of digital information technology to advance scholarship and education. In establishing the Coalition under the leadership of founding Executive Director [[Paul Evan Peters]], these sponsor organizations sought to broaden the community’s thinking beyond issues of network connectivity and bandwidth to encompass digital content and advanced applications to create, share, disseminate, and analyze such content in the service of research and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=West|first=Richard P.|title=The Coalition for Networked Information and the Rewards of Risk Taking|journal=portal: Libraries and the Academy|date=July 2009|volume=9:3|issue=FESTSCHRIFT Honoring Duane E. Webster Executive Director, Association of Research Libraries 1988–2008|pages=317–325}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNI works on a broad array of issues related to the development and use of digital information in the research and education communities.&lt;ref name=ELIS&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science, entry on CNI|year=2010|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=9780849397127|pages=561–569|url=http://www.cni.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/elis.cni_.08.web_.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

CNI fosters connections and collaboration between library and information technology communities, representing the interests of a wide range of member organizations from higher education, publishing, networking and telecommunications, information technology, government agencies, foundations, museums, libraries, and library organizations.&lt;ref name=members&gt;{{cite web|title=CNI Members|url=http://www.cni.org/about-cni/membership/members/|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based in Washington, DC, CNI holds semi-annual membership meetings that serve as a bellwether for digital information issues and projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CNI Membership Meetings|url=http://www.cni.org/events/membership-meetings/|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNI also hosts invitational conferences, co-sponsors related meetings and conferences, issues reports, advises government agencies and funders, and supports a variety of networked information initiatives.

==History==
In 1990, the Association of Research Libraries (ARL), Educom, and CAUSE joined together to form CNI to create a collaborative project focused on high speed networking that would integrate the interests of academic and research libraries (ARL) and computing in higher education (Educom and CAUSE). Educom and CAUSE consolidated their organizations in 1998 to form EDUCAUSE, which is now one half of the partnership that oversees CNI. Structurally, CNI is a program of its founding associations with administrative oversight provided by ARL; it is not a legally separate entity. CNI’s oversight is provided by the boards and CEOs of the founding organizations, and a steering committee guides its program.&lt;ref name=ELIS /&gt; 

[[Paul Evan Peters]] was the founding executive director; [http://www.cni.org/about-cni/staff/joan-k-lippincott/ Joan Lippincott], also joined CNI as the associate executive director at that time. In 1997, [[Clifford Lynch]] assumed the role of executive director, and continues to serve in that capacity as of 2013. CNI’s program has included projects in the areas of architectures and standards for networked information, scholarly communication, economics of networked information, Internet technology and infrastructure, teaching and learning, institutional and professional implications of the networked environment, and government information on the Internet.&lt;ref name="CNI History webpage"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coalition for Networked Information|title=History of the Coalition for Networked Information (CNI)|url=http://www.cni.org/about-cni/history/|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central themes==

;Developing and managing networked content
The Coalition has played a central role in ensuring that the network richly engages the needs of scholarship, teaching and learning. We bring together many diverse groups that create and manage content, and work with these communities to advance the deployment and stewardship of networked information resources. Changes in scholarly practices (particularly those shorthanded by “e-science” or “e-research”) require a close and continuing examination of information creation, aggregation, exchange, reuse, and preservation throughout the research and education community and society broadly; these developments, and the evolving roles of higher education and cultural memory institutions in facilitating and supporting them are a central part of the CNI agenda. Working within these contexts and others, CNI furthers the development of economic, policy, social and legal frameworks to sustain the creation and management of digital information and facilitate its access.&lt;ref name="CNI Program Plan"&gt;[http://www.cni.org/program/ CNI Program Plan], CNI.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Transforming organization, professions, and individuals
The pervasiveness of ubiquitously accessible digital information is transforming institutions, professions, and the practices of learning and scholarship. CNI focuses on the unprecedented need for collaboration among libraries, information technology and instructional technology groups, faculty, museums, archives, university presses, and other units in order to achieve success in this environment. In addition, we promote new alliances and partnerships with publishers, information technology and network service providers, scholarly societies, government, and other sectors. Organizations must understand their constituencies and adapt their services and facilities to current needs; they must develop and share new strategies, policies, and best practices. Professions need to develop new competencies and enter into new dialogues that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries. CNI seeks to facilitate these collaborations and dialogues and to help professions and institutions work together in program strategy formulation.&lt;ref name="CNI Program Plan" /&gt;

;Building technology standards and infrastructure
The networked information environment relies on the development and deployment of standards and infrastructure components in order to enable the creation, discovery, use, and management of digital information on the Internet. The ability to use collections of resources in a unified, consistent fashion is essential and requires a continuing focus on interoperability of services. At the same time, promising new technologies need to be explored, assessed and tested, and sometimes adapted to the needs of the CNI community. No one institution acting alone can build the needed infrastructure or explore the full range of new technologies as they become available; it requires a coordinated, community-wide effort that also reaches out to other communities, such as the world of e-research. CNI seeks to highlight links between technology and policies at all levels, to offer a context for collaborative experiments and test beds, and to serve as a focal point for sharing knowledge about new technologies.&lt;ref name="CNI Program Plan" /&gt;

{{for|the metaphysical treatise by David Lewis |On the Plurality of Worlds}}
{{italic title}}
'''''Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds''''' ({{lang-fr|Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes}}) is a [[popular science]] book by French author [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]], published in 1686. It offered an explanation of the [[heliocentric]] model of the Universe, suggested by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in his 1543 work ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]''. The book is Fontenelle's most famous work and is considered to be one of the first major works of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

==Background==
Unlike many scientific works of its time, ''Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds'' was written not in [[Latin]], but in French and is notable as one of the first books to attempt an explanation of [[science|scientific theories]] in [[Popular science|popular]] language. In the preface, Fontenelle addresses female readers and suggests that the offered explanation should be easily understood even by those without scientific knowledge. This move has been praised by some modern feminist critics as admitting women's intelligence in scientific matters.&lt;ref&gt;''Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds''. By Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle. Translated by H. A. Hargreaves. Edited by Nina Rattner Gelbart. Berkeley: University of California Press. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  A precursor includes [[Giordano Bruno]]'s [[:it:De l'infinito, universo e mondi|''De l'infinito, universo e mondi'']].

==Plot summary==
The book itself is presented as a series of conversations between a gallant [[philosopher]] and a [[marquise]], who walk in the latter's garden at night and gaze at [[star]]s. The philosopher explains the heliocentric model and also muses on the possibility of [[extraterrestrial life]]. Fontenelle's work was not cast polemically against the world views of either the [[Catholic Church]] or the Protestant churches, nor did it attract the attention, positive or negative, of theologians or prelates.

==Translations==
The first English translation was compounded by [[John Glanvill]] in 1687, followed by another translation by [[Aphra Behn]] in 1688, under the title ''A Discovery of New Worlds''. [[Antiokh Kantemir]] translated it into [[Russian language|Russian]] in 1730, although the translation was only published in a [[censorship|censored]] edition in 1740, due to objections from the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

==Reception==
The book was very well received both in France and elsewhere, and was regularly published. In 1691, Fontenelle was elected to the [[Académie française]].&lt;ref&gt;"Fontenelle, Bernard Le Bovier, sieur de." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007.

'''Elisabeth Eleonore Anna Justine "Elly" Heuss-Knapp''', (née '''Knapp'''; 25 January 1881 &amp;ndash; 19 July 1952), was a [[Germans|German]] politician of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP), social reformer, author and wife of German president [[Theodor Heuss]]. She was the founder of the ''[[Müttergenesungswerk]]'' charitable organisation officially called Elly Heuss-Knapp Foundation in her honour.

== Life ==
Elly Knapp was born in [[Strasbourg|Straßburg]], then capital of the Imperial Territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], the daughter of the renowned economist [[Georg Friedrich Knapp]] (1842–1926), founder of the [[Chartalism|chartalist]] school of [[monetary theory]], who taught at the [[University of Strasbourg|Straßburg University]]. Her mother Lydia Qorghanashvili (1849–1925), who was from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], became mentally ill shortly after her birth. Elly, a bright, inquisitive child, and her sister Marianne spent much time with their grandparents and were raised by their father alone, uncommon at the time.

She studied to become a teacher, taking the exam in 1899, and worked as a teacher at a girls' school in Straßburg from 1900, of which she was one of the co-founders. Concerned with [[civics|civic]] education, she early became influenced by the [[Liberalism in Germany|liberal]] politician [[Friedrich Naumann]] and in 1905, she went on to study economics in [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], while becoming a frequent public speaker on political issues. In 1908, she married then-journalist Theodor Heuss, an assistant to Friedrich Naumann. The wedding in Straßburg was presided over by [[Albert Schweitzer]]. Their only son, Ernst Ludwig Heuss, was born in 1910. Due to complications during that birth (which was nearly fatal for Elly), she could not have more children.

Back in [[Berlin]] after [[World War I]], Elly Heuss-Knapp like her husband had been a candidate for the liberal [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP) in the [[German federal election, 1919|German federal election of 1919]], strongly emphasiszing [[women's suffrage]]. Over the years Elly became more interested in theological questions and from 1922 became active in the Protestant congregation of [[Otto Dibelius]] in Berlin.

After the Nazi ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' in 1933, she was forbidden to speak publicly, and her husband was dismissed from his lecturing job at the university. Their home became a meeting place of people opposed to the regime, including the [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]] pastor [[Martin Niemöller]]. Elly Heuss-Knapp became an author and also worked in [[advertising]] to support her family, developing an early kind of [[jingle]] radio commercial. Her autobiography, ''Ausblick vom Münsterturm'', was published in 1934, and a second edition in 1952. In the final stage of the [[World War II]] Heuss-Knapp and her husband lived in [[Heidelberg]].

After the war she was elected a member of the [[Landtag]] state legislature in [[Württemberg-Baden]] in 1946, as a representative of the liberal [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party]] (DVP) and its Free Democratic Party (FDP) successor. Her work as a politician concentrated on child care and social policy in general, earning her the reputation of an unofficial "mother of the state". She finished her parliamentary career when her husband was elected [[President of Germany]] in 1949.

Together with her husband, Elly Heuss-Knapp was one of the co-founders of the [[European Movement Germany|European Movement]] in Germany in June 1949, and was Vice President of the organisation. On 31 January 1950 she publicly announced the foundation of the ''Müttergenesungswerk'' organisation for maternal health, which remained under the patronage of the wives of the German presidents up to today. It was later named ''Elly-Heuss-Knapp-Stiftung – Deutsches Müttergenesungswerk'' in her honour.

Elly Heuss-Knapp died in 1952 at the university clinic in [[Bonn]], and was buried at the [[Stuttgart]] ''Waldfriedhof'' cemetery.

'''Four Treasures of the Study''', '''Four Jewels of the Study''' or '''Four Friends of the Study''' is an expression used to denote the [[ink brush|brush]], [[inkstick|ink]], [[Xuan paper|paper]] and [[ink stone]] used in [[Chinese calligraphy|Chinese]] and other [[East Asia]]n calligraphic traditions.  The name appears to originate in the time of the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] (420–589 AD).&lt;ref name="ctoday"&gt;Chinesetoday.com.

==Four Treasures==
Chinese culture is very fond of [[Chengyu|four word couplets]], and the '''Four Treasures''' is another example: "文房四寶: 筆、墨、紙、硯," (Pinyin: ''wén fáng sì bǎo: bǐ, mò, zhǐ, yàn'') "''The four jewels of the study: Brush, Ink, Paper, Inkstone.''"&lt;ref name="ctoday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="big5x"&gt;Big5.xinhuanet.com. "[http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/www.godpp.gov.cn/yxzp_/2007-10/23/content_11468094.htm Big5.xinhuanet.com]." ''走近文房四寶.'' Retrieved on 2010-11-27.&lt;/ref&gt; In the couplet mentioned, each of the '''Treasures''' is referred to by a single [[epithet]]; however, each of these are usually known by a compound name (''i.e.'' The Brush: 毛筆, literally "''hair brush/pen''). The individual treasures have a "treasured" form, each being produced in certain areas of China as a speciality for those scholars who would use them.These are called the 4 SPECIAL Treasures of the Study.

===Brush===
{{Main|Ink brush}}

[[File:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - calligraphy brush with dragon design.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|A highly decorative badger hair brush dating to the [[Ming Dynasty]].]] The brush ({{zh|t=毛筆|s=毛笔|p=máo bǐ}}) is the oldest '''Four Treasures''' member, with archaeological evidence dating to [[Zhou dynasty]] (1045 BC–256 BC) illustrations on ancient bones. The oldest brush so far dates to [[Han dynasty]] (202 BC–220 AD). Brushes are generally made from animal hair, or —in certain situations—the first hair taken from a baby's head (said to bring good luck in the [[Imperial examinations]]). Brush handles are commonly constructed from [[bamboo]], but special brushes may have handles of [[sandalwood]], [[jade]], carved bone/ivory, or other precious materials.

Modern brushes are primarily white goat hair (羊毫), black rabbit hair (紫毫), yellow weasel hair (黄鼠毫/狼毫), or a combination mix. Ancient brushes, and some of the more valuable ones available on the market may be made with the hair of any number of different types of animals. Each type of hair has a specific ink capacity, giving distinct brush strokes. Different brushes are used for different styles of calligraphy and writing.

Brushes are classed as soft (軟毫), mixed (兼毫) or hard (硬毫).  Hair is laboriously sorted by softness, hardness, thickness, &amp; length, then bundled for specific uses. The most famous and highly prized brushes are a mix of yellow weasel, goat and rabbit hair, known as Húbǐ (湖筆); highly prized since the [[Ming dynasty]] (late 14th century) they are currently made in [[Shanlian]] (善琏), a town in the [[Nanxun District]], [[prefecture-level city]] of [[Huzhou]], of [[Zhejiang province]] (浙江).

===Ink===
{{Main|Inkstick}}

[[File:Inkstick.jpg|upright|thumb|An inkstick made in the form of lotus leaves and flowers.]]The Inkstick (Chinese: 墨 pinyin: ''{{audio|Zh-mò.ogg|mò|help=no}}'') is an artificial ink developed during the [[Han dynasty]]. These first writing inks were based on naturally occurring minerals like [[graphite]] and [[vermilion]]; earliest inks were probably liquids and not preserved. Modern inksticks are generally made of soots from one of three different sources, including [[lacquer]] [[soot]], [[pine]] soot, and [[oil]] soot. Soots are collected, then mixed with glue. Higher quality inksticks also use powdered spices and herbs, adding to aroma and providing some protection to the ink itself.  The glue, soot, and spice mixture is then pressed into shape and allowed to dry. This process can take 6 weeks, depending on an inkstick's dimensions.

The best ink sticks are fine grained and have a light, slightly ringing sound when tapped. They are often decorated with poems, calligraphy, or [[bas relief]], and painted. These particular articles are highly collectable, and often acquired like stamps. The inksticks in highest regard, known as Huīmò (徽墨), contain [[musk]], [[borneol]] and other precious [[aromatics]] of [[Chinese medicine]]. They are still produced today in [[She County, Anhui|Shexian]] (歙县) in [[Anhui province]] (安徽).

===Paper===
{{Main|Xuan Paper}}

[[File:Treatise On Calligraphy.jpg|thumb|upright|A detail from ''The Treatise on Calligraphy'' by [[Sun Guoting]] (646–691). Ink on Paper.]]Paper (Chinese: ''traditional'' 紙, ''simplified'' 纸; Pinyin: ''{{audio|Zh-zhǐ.ogg|zhǐ|help=no}}'') was first developed in China in the first decade of 100 AD. Previous to its invention, bamboo slips and silks were used for writing material. Several methods of paper production developed over the centuries in China. However, the paper which was considered of highest value was that of the Jingxian (泾县) in Anhui province.

This particular form of paper, known as Xuānzhǐ (宣紙), is soft, fine-textured, moth resistant, has a high tensile strength, and remarkable longevity for such a product – so much so that it has a reputation for lasting "1,000 years". The quality of the paper depends on the processing methods used to produce it. Paper may be unprocessed, half processed or processed. The processing determines how well ink or paint is absorbed into the fibre of the paper, as well as the stiffness of the paper itself. Unprocessed papers are very absorbent and quite malleable, whereas processed papers are far more resistant to absorption and are stiffer.

===Inkstone===
{{Main|Inkstone}}

[[File:Duan Inkstone.JPG|left|thumb|A Duan Inkstone in the shape of a pond.]]The inkstone (Chinese: ''traditional'' 硯 or 硯臺; ''simplified'' 砚 or 砚台; Pinyin: ''{{audio|Zh-yàn.ogg|yàn|help=no}}'' or ''yàn tái'') is used to grind the ink stick into powder. This powder is then mixed with water in a well in the inkstone in order to produce usable ink for calligraphy. The most ideal water for use in ink is slightly salty. Ink was first prepared using a mortar and pestle, but with the advent of inksticks this method slowly vanished. The stone used is generally of a relatively fine whetstone type.

The earliest known inkstones date back to the [[Han dynasty]]. The production of inkstones reached its zenith in the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song dynasties]] with inkstones becoming extremely intricate works of art. The most highly sought-after inkstones originated in four different locations in China. Duanshi stones (端石硯) from Duanxi in [[Guangdong]], She stones (歙硯) from [[She County, Anhui|Shexian]] in [[Anhui]], Taohe stones (洮河硯) from the [[Tao River]] in South [[Gansu]] and Chengni ceramic stones (澄泥硯) which are manufactured by a process which is said to have been developed in [[Luoyang]] in [[Henan]].

==Tools of the Scholar==
Classical scholars had more than just the '''Four treasures''' in their studies. The other "Treasures" include the [[brush-holder]] (笔架), brush-hanger (笔挂), paperweights (镇纸), the brush-rinsing pot (笔洗), and the [[Seal (East Asia)|seal]] (圖章) and seal-ink (印泥).

For painting, [[Chinese pigment]]s are also used.

'''''Heroes in Hell''''' is a series of [[shared universe|shared world]] [[fantasy]] books, within the genre [[Bangsian fantasy]], created and edited by [[Janet Morris]] and written by her, [[Chris Morris (author)|Chris Morris]], [[C. J. Cherryh]] and others.  The first 12 books in the series were published by [[Baen Books]] between 1986 and 1989, and stories from the series include one [[Hugo Award]] winner and Nebula nominee, ("[[Gilgamesh in the Outback]]" by [[Robert Silverberg]] from ''Rebels in Hell''), as well as one other [[Nebula Award]] nominee. The series was resurrected in 2011 by Janet Morris with the thirteenth book and eighth anthology in the series, ''Lawyers in Hell'', followed by six more anthologies and three novels between 2012 and 2018.

==Background==
The shared world premise of ''Heroes in Hell'' (also called ''The Damned Saga'') is that all the dead wind up together in [[Hell]], where they pick up where they left off when still alive.{{sfn|Card|1990|p=125}} Robert W. Cape, Jr, in ''Classical Traditions in Science Fiction'', Oxford University Press"&lt;ref name="Classical Traditions in Science Fiction"&gt;{{cite book | last = Rogers | first = Brett M. |  authorlink = Brett M. Rogers |author2=Stevens, Benjamin Eldon | title = Classical Traditions in Science Fiction | url = https://global.oup.com/academic/product/classical-traditions-in-science-fiction-9780199988419?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp; | page = 331 | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2015 | isbn = 9780199988419}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote "...in the popular ''Heroes in Hell'' series, Julius Caesar intrigues in the underworld with Alexander the Great, Machiavelli, and other historical rulers. Death has not changed their natures, and their political and military machinations seem similar to those of rulers at the end of the Cold War." ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'' states "In the long series of shared world adventures begun with ''Heroes in Hell'', Hell becomes an arena in which all the interesting people in history can come together to continue the relentless pursuit of their various ends."{{sfn|Clute and Grant|1997|p=461}} [[Brian Stableford]] commented that the series "adapted the backcloth of Dantean fantasy as a stage for violent adventures with ironic echoes of infernal comedy".{{sfn|Stableford|2005|p=356}}

==Reception==
Science fiction and fantasy author [[Orson Scott Card]] compared the success of ''Heroes in Hell'' with other shared worlds like ''[[Thieves' World]]'', ''[[Wild Cards]]'' and ''[[Liavek]]'', and said that this "almost guarantees that shared worlds will be around for many years to come".{{sfn|Card|1990|p=126}} The webzine ''[[SF Site]]'' discussed the popularity of shared worlds in the 1980s and listed ''Heroes in Hell'' as a "significant example" of one of them.&lt;ref name=SF-Site/&gt; ''Library Journal'' called ''Heroes in Hell'' "a garden of infernal delights."&lt;ref&gt;Jackie Cassada, ''Library Journal'', "Heroes in Hell", March 15, 1986, Volume 111, Issue 5, page 80&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Miriam Van Scott]] reviews the first novel in the series within her book ''[[Encyclopedia of Hell]]''.{{sfn|Van Scott|1998|p=162}}
{{Quote|text=Author Janet Morris created a unique underworld saga in her 1984 book, Heroes in Hell, a witty novel that declares "Nobody who is anybody went to heaven."  The collection of infernal vignettes features everyone from the legendary hero GILGAMESH to actor James Dean in the great below, with the likes of Caesar and Mao Zedong thrown in for color.  Trapped in the abyss of fire, the villains continue vying for power and position in the underworld to the delight of SATAN, their new overseer.  Heroes was published with a companion novel, Gates of Hell.}}

She later describes the entire series within the same book.{{sfn|Van Scott|1998|p=162}}  
{{Quote|text=Innovative and clever, the Damned Saga weaves myth, legend, fact, and fantasy into a fascinating tapestry of underworld lore.  The Heroes series also testifies to the immense popularity hell enjoys even in this modern age of literature.}}

==Books in the series==
There are eight novels in the series and thirteen anthologies of short fiction. Janet Morris edited all twelve anthologies. Portions of ''Legions of Hell'' first appeared in stories published in ''Heroes in Hell'', ''The Gates of Hell'', ''Rebels in Hell'', ''Kings in Hell'' and ''Crusaders in Hell''.

'''Horatio Clarence Hocken''' (October 12, 1857 &amp;ndash; February 18, 1937) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] politician, [[List of Toronto mayors|Mayor of Toronto]], social reformer, a founder of what became the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' and Grand Master of the [[Orange Order in Canada|Grand Orange Lodge of British America]] from 1914-1918.

Born in [[Toronto]] in what was pre-[[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] [[Canada West]], Hocken had a media career as a printer, publisher and journalist. After working as a typesetter at the ''[[Toronto Globe]]'' at which he led a strike, Hocken, in 1892, Hocken was a foremen in the print room of the ''Toronto News'' when the Typographical Union went on strike. He and 20 other strikers founded the ''[[Toronto Star|Evening Star]]'' as a strike paper with Hocken as the new paper's business manager.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hanlon, "Out of the darkness The Evening Star is born --- A group of jilted printers had enough and created 'a paper for the people'", ''Toronto Star'', November 1, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently left the ''Star'' and returned to the ''News'' where he became city editor. In 1905 he purchased ''The Orange Sentinel'', a weekly newspaper serving supporters of the [[Orange Order]].

==Local politics==
He served on the [[Toronto Board of Control]] from 1907 until 1910 when he made his first unsuccessful bid for the mayor's office and again from 1911 until 1912. He served as mayor from 1912 to 1914. He is credited with approving the [[Bloor Viaduct]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Hannon, "Leap of faith", ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now Magazine]]'', February 26, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; As mayor, Hocken supported opening city parks to public use rather than being restricted to the use of athletic societies arguing that parks are for "walking in, not for athletic sports". He built public baths, installed a sewage treatment plant and a filtration plant, and the extension of the sewer system. Hocken's term also saw the distribution of free milk to children living in slums and the establishment of a public health nursing program. His reforms saw the death rate from communicable disease drop from 114 per 100,000 to 27 per 100,000. Hocken also supported the creation of a public housing company that built houses and rented them for cost. The city, under his stewardship, also purchased an abattoir and cold storage facility to help keep small butchers from being driven out of business by "the great meat trust."&lt;ref&gt;http://members.tripod.com/~Roughian/Hocken.html{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal politics==
Hocken's career in federal politics began when he was elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] for the [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist Party]] at the [[Toronto West]] riding in the [[Canadian federal election, 1917|1917 federal election]]. He was re-elected in Toronto West in the [[Canadian federal election, 1921|1921 federal election]], this time under the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]]. When the riding boundaries were changed in 1924, he was re-elected in the [[Toronto West Centre]] riding in the [[Canadian federal election, 1925|1925]] and [[Canadian federal election, 1926|1926 federal elections]]. He served in the [[13th Canadian Parliament|13th]] to the [[16th Canadian Parliament]]s consecutively until he left federal politics in 1930.

Hocken was appointed a member of the [[Senate of Canada]] from 30 December 1933 and remained in that office until death.

==Personal life==

He married Isabella Page in 1880. They had four children. He died two days after she did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7985339/senate_loses_noted_figure_in_h_c/|title=Senate Loses Noted Figure In H. C.

&lt;/ref&gt; but is arguably best known for authoring a number of [[popular-science]] books combining topics from diverse fields other than those he has formally studied. Because of this academic diversity, Diamond has been described as a [[polymath]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular science works==
=== ''The Third Chimpanzee'' (1991) ===
Diamond's first popular book, ''[[The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal]]'' (1991), examines [[human evolution]] and its relevance to the modern world, incorporating evidence from [[anthropology]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[genetics]], ecology, and [[linguistics]]. The book traces how humans evolved to be so different from other animals, despite sharing over 98% of our DNA with our closest animal relatives, the chimpanzees. The book also examines the animal origins of language, art, agriculture, smoking and drug use, and other apparently uniquely human attributes. It was well received by critics and won the 1992 [[Rhône-Poulenc Prize for Science Books]]&lt;ref name="rsocprizes"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Prize for Science Books previous winners and shortlists | url=http://royalsociety.org/bookspage.asp?id=6372 | publisher=[[Royal Society]] | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Los Angeles Times Book Prize]].&lt;ref name="latimesprize"&gt;{{Cite news| title=Los Angeles Times Festival of Books&amp;nbsp;– Book Prizes&amp;nbsp;– Winners by Award (science) | url=http://www.latimes.com/extras/bookprizes/winners_byaward.html#science |work=Los Angeles Times | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' (1997) ===
His second and best known popular science book, ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]]'', was published in 1997. It asks why [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian peoples]] conquered or displaced Native Americans, Australians, and Africans, instead of vice versa. It argues that this outcome was not due to biological advantages of Eurasian peoples themselves but instead to features of the Eurasian continent, in particular, its high diversity of wild plant and animal species suitable for domestication and its east/west major axis that favored the spread of those domesticates, people, and technologies for long distances with little change in latitude. The first part of the book focuses on reasons why only a few species of wild plants and animals proved suitable for domestication. The second part discusses how local food production based on those domesticates led to the development of dense and stratified human populations, writing, centralized political organization, and epidemic infectious diseases. The third part compares the development of food production and of human societies among different continents and world regions. ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' became an international best-seller, was translated into 33 languages, and received several awards, including a [[Pulitzer Prize]], an [[Aventis Prize for Science Books]]&lt;ref name=rsocprizes/&gt; and the 1997 [[Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pbk.org/infoview/PBK_Infoview.aspx?t=&amp;id=57 | title=1997 Phi Beta Kappa Science Book Award | publisher=Phi Beta Kappa | accessdate=February 16, 2014 | archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5DBVfgGvk?url=http://www.geeky.net/images/webbadge.gif | archive-date=January 24, 2006 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A television documentary series based on the book was produced by the [[National Geographic Society]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lovgren|first=Stefan|title='Guns, Germs and Steel': Jared Diamond on Geography as Power|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/07/0706_050706_diamond.html|accessdate=6 December 2012|newspaper=National Geographic News|date=6 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guns, Germs &amp; Steel: The Show|url=https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/show/index.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Why is Sex Fun?'' (1997) ===

In his third book, ''[[Why is Sex Fun?]]'', also published in 1997, Diamond discusses evolutionary factors underlying features of human sexuality that are generally taken for granted but that are highly unusual among our animal relatives. Those features include a long-term pair relationship (marriage), coexistence of economically cooperating pairs within a shared communal territory, provision of parental care by fathers as well as by mothers, having sex in private rather than in public, concealed ovulation, female sexual receptivity encompassing most of the menstrual cycle (including days of infertility), female but not male menopause, and distinctive secondary sexual characteristics.

=== ''Collapse'' (2005) ===
Diamond's next book, ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', published in 2005, examines a range of past societies in an attempt to identify why they either collapsed or continued to thrive and considers what contemporary societies can learn from these historical examples. As in ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'', he argues against explanations for the failure of past societies based primarily on cultural factors, instead focusing on ecology. Among the societies mentioned in the book are the [[Norse colonization of the Americas|Norse]] and [[Inuit]] of [[Greenland]], the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], the [[Anasazi]], the indigenous people of [[Rapa Nui]] (Easter Island), Japan, Haiti, the [[Dominican Republic]], and modern [[Montana]]. The book concludes by asking why some societies make disastrous decisions, how big businesses affect the environment, what our principal environmental problems are today, and what individuals can do about those problems. Like ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'', ''Collapse'' was translated into dozens of languages, became an international best-seller, and was the basis of a television documentary produced by the National Geographic Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | editor1-last = Demenocal | editor1-first = Peter B. | editor2-last = Cook | editor2-first = Edward R. | title = Perspectives on Diamond's Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed | series = CA Forum on Anthropology in Public | journal = Current Anthropology | date = December 2005 | volume = 46 | issue = supplement | pages = S91–S99 | jstor = 3597146 | doi = 10.2307/3597146 | issn = 0011-3204 }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McAnany, P.A. &amp; Yoffee, N.

=== "Vengeance is Ours" controversy (2008) ===&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: the following passage about the controversy surrounding Diamond's article Vengeance is Ours has been extensively discussed to ensure it does not give undue weight to the issue; please consider any changes carefully, and/or raise them on the talk page beforehand --&gt;
In 2008, Diamond published an article in ''The New Yorker'' entitled "Vengeance Is Ours",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Diamond |first=Jared |date=2008-04-21 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/04/21/080421fa_fact_diamond |title=Vengeance Is Ours |work=Annals of Anthropology |page=74}}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the role of revenge in tribal warfare in [[Papua New Guinea]]. A year later two indigenous people mentioned in the article filed a lawsuit against Diamond and ''The New Yorker'' claiming the article defamed them.&lt;ref name="science"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Balter | first1 = M. | title = 'Vengeance' Bites Back at Jared Diamond| doi = 10.1126/science.324_872 | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = 5929 | pages = 872–874 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19443760| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20090422/us-jared-diamond-lawsuit/|title=Author Jared Diamond sued for libel|last=Maull|first=Samuel|date=April 22, 2009|publisher=AP News|accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smillie |first=Dirk |title=Fresh Legal Jab At 'The New Yorker' |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/10/18/papua-jared-diamond-business-media-new-yorker.html |accessdate=8 February 2013|newspaper=Forbes |date=19 October 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125013811/http://www.forbes.com/2009/10/18/papua-jared-diamond-business-media-new-yorker.html |archivedate=November 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ''The Observer'' reported that the lawsuit "was withdrawn by mutual consent after the sudden death of their lawyer."&lt;ref name=guardian012013&gt;{{cite web|last=McKie|first=Robin|title=Jared Diamond: what we can learn from tribal life|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jan/06/jared-diamond-tribal-life-anthropology|publisher=''[[The Observer]]''|date=January 5, 2013|accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Natural Experiments in History'' (2010) ===
In 2010, Diamond co-edited (with James Robinson) ''Natural Experiments of History'', a collection of seven case studies illustrating the [[Multidisciplinarity|multidisciplinary]] and comparative approach to the study of history that he advocates. The book’s title stems from the fact that it is not possible to study history by the preferred methods of the laboratory sciences, i.e., by controlled experiments comparing replicated human societies as if they were test tubes of bacteria. Instead, one must look at natural experiments in which human societies that are similar in many respects have been historically perturbed, either by different starting conditions or by different impacts.{{clarify|date=April 2014|reason= "Impacts" is an awfully general word. It could mean almost anything. Could this be made a bit more specific?}} The book’s afterword classifies natural experiments, discusses the practical difficulties of studying them, and offers suggestions on how to address those difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Natural Experiments of History – Jared Diamond, James A. Robinson|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674035577|publisher=Harvard University Press|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The World Until Yesterday'' (2012) ===
Diamond's most recent book, ''[[The World Until Yesterday]]'', published in 2012, asks what the [[western world]] can learn from [[traditional society|traditional societies]]. It surveys 39 traditional small-scale societies of farmers and hunter-gatherers with respect to how they deal with universal human problems. The problems discussed include dividing space, resolving disputes, bringing up children, treatment of elders, dealing with dangers, formulating religions, learning multiple languages, and remaining healthy. The book suggests that some practices of traditional societies could be usefully adopted in the modern industrial world today, either by individuals or else by society as a whole.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The auction houses were getting more publicity with sales of $40 million van Goghs. I think galleries were feeling left behind, and they started launching art fairs as counterweights to the auction spectacle, which it really was. The totals accelerated with the arrival of Japanese buyers, and that also drew a lot of media attention. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ARTNews]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.artnews.com/author/judd_tully/ | title =Judd Tully Author Archive | last =Tully| first =Judd | website =artnews.com | publisher =ARTNews | access-date =June 1, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flash Art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/32269/reflections-judd-tully | title =Reflections: Judd Tully | last =Tully | first =Judd | date =September 9, 2009 | website =blouinartinfo.com | publisher =Blouin ARTINFO | access-date =June 6, 2018 | quote =I started out writing art reviews for Flash Art and Arts in the 1980s in New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; and covered topics such as the potential indictment of museum staff in response to [[Robert Mapplethorpe]]'s 1990 retrospective, and some of the first post-war multi-million dollar auction records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Tully | first =Judd | title =INDICTED MUSEUM DIRECTOR'S WARNING | publisher =The Washington Post | date =April 27, 1990 | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1990/04/27/indicted-museum-directors-warning/84a2af23-2c5a-4145-abed-9f3bb31e73a6/ | access-date =June 28, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Tully | first =Judd | title =17 Million Dollar Sale at Sotheby's | newspaper =The Washington Post | pages =18 | date =November 5, 1987 | url =http://juddtully.net/auctions/17-million-dollar-sale-at-sothebys/ | access-date =June 28, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is formerly the Editor-at-large for Blouin Artinfo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://muckrack.com/judd-tully | title =Judd Tully | website =muckrack.com | publisher =Muck Rack | access-date =June 6, 2018 | quote =Art Critic and Writer - Former Editor at Large of BLOUIN ART + Auction magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.artagencypartners.com/episode-10-the-art-media/ | title =In Other Words: Episode 10: The Art Media | last =Burns | first =Charlotte | date =June 15, 2017 | website =artagencypartners.com | publisher =Art Agency Partners | access-date =October 23, 2017 | quote =Charlotte Burns: And we have Judd Tully, an award-winning journalist, widely-published writer and critic, who is the Editor-At-Large at Blouin Art + Auction magazine and Blouin Art Info.

Judd Tully: Too many. I was primarily covering, from ‘86-’87, contemporary art and Impressionist and Modern art. And these were tiny sales. Minuscule.

Not for, say, a Mark Grotjahn painting, but the whole sale. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has also appeared on CNBC and MSNBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people =Alex Witt, Judd Tully | title =Judd Tully - MSNBC - Historic Week in Art Sales | medium =video | publisher =MSNBC | location =juddtully.net | date =May 18, 2015 | url =http://juddtully.net/video/historic-week-in-art-sales-msnbc/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people =Larry Salander, Judd Tully | title =AMERICAN GREED EPISODE 47: THE ART OF THE STEAL | medium =video | publisher =CNBC | location =CNBC | date =April 1, 2011 | url =https://www.cnbc.com/id/100000023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

And then I wrote for “The New Art Examiner” in Chicago. I went to the Museum of Modern Art library. I used to hang out there and look at publications. And I liked that publication, contacted them, and then started writing stuff about New York for them. And then it gradually—I got very lucky in the mid-eighties—and started freelancing as a stringer for the “Washington Post” for the style section. And then wrote a tremendous amount of stuff on auctions. Not that I knew anything about them. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://kleinartistworks.com/excerpts-from-klein-artist-works-webinars/judd-tully-2/ | title =Judd Tully | website =kleinartistworks.com | publisher =Klein Artist Works | access-date =October 23, 2017 | quote =New York-based arts writer and journalist Judd Tully has been steeped in the international art market since the mid-1970s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2621">'''Lavangi''' is a [[national dish]] of [[Azerbaijan]]i and [[Iran]]ian cuisine. It is a fish or chicken  stuffed with [[walnuts]], [[onions]] and various condiments and baked in the oven. Lavangi is most prevalent in the Absheron peninsula of Azerbaijan and in Lankaran, Masalli, Salyan and Neftchala districts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://matbuat.az/news/68806/metbex-sirleri-baliq-ve-toyuq-levengisi-kuku.html Secrets of Cuisine: Stuffed fish and chicken] matbuat.az&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stuffed fish (Balıq Ləvəngisi)==
[[File:Ləvəngi.JPG|thumb|left|Stuffed fish ({{lang-az|Balıq Ləvəngisi}})]]
[[File:Balıq ləvəngisi.jpg|thumb|right|Stuffed fish ({{lang-az|Balıq Ləvəngisi}})]]
Stuffed fish, also called "Balıq Ləvəngisi", is usually prepared for [[Nowruz]]; The preferred fish is the [[Caspian kutum]], or [[carp]] of the [[Caspian Sea]], but white fish-[[Beluga (sturgeon)]] can also be suitable.

The other condiments for  filling are sour [[prune]] or sour [[cherry]] or a [[pomegranate]] juice syrup called "narsharab" ("nar" is the local name of pomegranate in [[Azerbaijan]]).

These condiments are added to the mixture with walnuts crushed and onions chopped, if the fish has [[caviar]], these are also used in the filling.

After the roasted fish, it is served with pieces of [[lemon]], bread and "narsharab".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.milli.az/society/40272.html The most common dish of Lankaran:Stuffed fish (Balıq Ləvəngisi)] news.milli.az &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://evcookfafa.wordpress.com/2013/11/24/t%C9%99r%C9%99v%C9%99zli-baliq-l%C9%99v%C9%99ngisi/ Stuffed fish] evcookfafa.wordpress.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stuffed chicken (Toyuq Ləvəngisi)==
[[File:Cuce-levengisi.jpg|thumb|right|Stuffed chicken or ({{lang-az|Toyuq Ləvəngisi}})]]
For stuffed chicken, "lavangi [[pilaf]]" the stuffing is prepared by making a puree with onions, which is squeezed into a cloth, to remove the liquid, and mixed with crushed walnuts and prune puree (probably of the sour [[plum]] type).

The chicken is first wiped with the plum puree, mixed with salt and pepper and then stuffed with the mentioned mixture and baked in medium oven until turn red.

Then it is served with lemon pieces and simple rice-[[pilaf]], in which the rice is fried in butter and then cooked in chicken broth with [[sesame]], [[ginger]], salt and pepper and served with roasted [[almonds]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tasty.az/az/azerbaycan-metbexi/497-levegi.html#axzz4nBf5o6Tj Azerbaijani cuisine:Lavangi] www.tasty.az &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1709">The '''Palestine Institute of Folklore and Ethnology''' was formed by [[Raphael Patai]] in [[Jerusalem]] in 1944. The Institute produced a journal series, ''Edoth'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: "Communities"), of which only three volumes were published (the last one in May 1948). The Institute published a series of monographs as well and was a unique enterprise in [[mandatory Palestine]].

Having failed to receive a post at the [[Hebrew University]], Patai pursued his own way in order to fill the void of ethnographic research carried out in Palestine. The Institute was formed after a series of discussions that took place in the Jerusalem community house. Patai was nominated as the Institute's director; the presidents of the Institute were Dr. Rabbi [[Max Grunwald]], who is recognized by many as the founder of the study of [[Jewish folklore]]; Chief Rabbi [[Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel]], a leading figure of the Jerusalem [[Sephardic]] community; [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]] who later became Israel's second president. Rabbi [[Y. L. Zlotnick]] (Avidah) became the Institute's fourth president at a later stage.

The Institute was centered on Patai's figure with contributors from the Jewish community in Palestine as well as anthropologists from abroad (mainly from the UK and the United States).
When Patai left Palestine after receiving a Viking Fund scholarship, he settled in the US and the Institute vanished by the end of 1948. Various attempts to revive it (notably by Zlotnick and the ethnomusicologist [[Edith Gerson-Kiwi]]) failed.

The Institute's correspondence is stored today at the archives of the [[Jewish National and University Library]].

'''Pech''' or '''Paya''' is a [[Chibchan language]] spoken in [[Honduras]]. According to [[Ethnologue]] there were a thousand speakers in 1993. It has also been referred to as Seco and Bayano.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; It is spoken near the north-central coast of Honduras, in the [[Dulce Nombre de Culmí]] municipality of [[Olancho Department]].

==Distribution==
According to [[Dennis Holt]] (1999), Pech is spoken by perhaps around 600 people in [[Olancho Department]] and [[Colón Department (Honduras)|Colón Department]] of Honduras. Pech used to be spoken in the town of [[Dulce Nombre de Culmí]] in the Río Guampú watershed, but Pech speakers moved out of the town due to the influx of [[Ladino people|Ladino]] migrants. The three primary Pech settlements are as follows.

*'''Vallecito''', about 5&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Dulce Nombre de Culmí]]. It had 120 inhabitants in 1975.
*'''Marañones''', also known as Pueblo Nuevo Subirana or Kahã Wayka (New Town). This town is about 15&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Dulce Nombre de Culmí]]. It had 150 inhabitants in 1975.
*'''El Carbón''', originally known as Santa María del Carbón. It is located near the Quebrada Agua Amarilla in a higher mountain valley in the upper Río Seco watershed, and is about 35&amp;nbsp;km north of Culmí and about 30&amp;nbsp;km northeast of San Esteban. It had about 300 inhabitants in 1975.

Vallecito and Marañones are both located in the foothills of the [[Sierra de Agalta]].

Other smaller Pech settlements which have at most several ethnic Pech families are scattered around northern [[Olancho Department]], including the following (Holt 1999).

*[[La Danta]]
*[[Aguazarca]]
*[[Aguaquire]]
*[[Pisijiri]]
*[[Jocomico]]

At the time of initial Spanish contact, Pech was most likely spoken from [[Trujillo, Honduras|Trujillo]] in the west to [[Cabo Gracias a Dios]] in the east, and as far south as the upper [[Patuca River]] (Holt 1999). Tol (Jicaque) would have been spoken just to the west.

==Phonology==
Pech is a tonal language with 16 consonants and 10 vowels (Holt 1999). There are two tones, namely a high tone and a low tone. Both consonants and vowels display length contrast and nasalization.

'''Pencak silat''' ({{IPA-may|ˈpent͡ʃak ˈsilat|id}}; in Western writings sometimes spelled "pentjak silat" or phonetically as "penchak silat") is an [[umbrella term]] for a class of related [[Indonesian martial arts]].&lt;ref name="Draeger1992"&gt;{{cite book| title=Weapons and fighting arts of Indonesia |author=[[Donn F. Draeger]] |year=1992 |publisher=Rutland, Vt. : Charles E. Tuttle Co. |isbn=978-0-8048-1716-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In neighbouring countries the term usually refers to professional competitive [[silat]]. It is a full-body fighting form incorporating strikes, grappling and throwing in addition to weaponry. Every part of the body is used and subject to attack. Pencak silat was practiced not only for physical defense but also for psychological ends.&lt;ref name="Black Belt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pencak Silat: Techniques and History of the Indonesian Martial Arts |publisher=Black Belt Magazine |url=http://www.blackbeltmag.com/freeguides/pencak-silat-techniques-and-history-of-the-indonesian-martial-arts/ |accessdate=6 July 2015|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914115154/http://www.blackbeltmag.com/freeguides/pencak-silat-techniques-and-history-of-the-indonesian-martial-arts/|archive-date=14 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading [[organization]] of pencak silat in Indonesia is ''Ikatan Pencak Silat Indonesia'' (Pencak Silat Association of Indonesia). The liaison body for international pencak silat is the International Pencak Silat Association or PERSILAT (''Persekutuan Pencak Silat Antara Bangsa'').

Pencak silat is one of the sports included in the [[Southeast Asian Games]] and other region-wide competitions. Pencak silat first made its debut in [[1987 Southeast Asian Games]] and [[2018 Asian Games]], both were held in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.asiangames2018.id/sport/pencak-silat/|title=Pencak Silat {{!}} Asian Games 2018 Jakarta Palembang|website=Asian Games 2018 Jakarta Palembang|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''[[Silat]]'' is a collective word for a class of indigenous [[martial arts]] from the geo-cultural area of [[Southeast Asia]], more precisely in the [[Malay Archipelago]], a region known locally as ''[[Nusantara]]''.&lt;ref name="Martial Arts of the World-Silat"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=FaTfuuIlmqcC&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=silat+malay+archipelago+nusantara&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi19Mj6yZvdAhXJOY8KHc1UDXUQ6AEIMjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=silat%20malay%20archipelago%20nusantara&amp;f=false|title=Martial Arts of the World: An Encyclopedia of History and Innovation|last=Green|first=Thomas A.|date=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598842432|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the word ''silat'' is uncertain. The [[Malay language|Malay]] term ''silat'' is linked to [[Minangkabau language|Minangkabau]] word ''silek''. Due to Sumatran origin of the language, the Sumatran origin of the term is likely.&lt;ref name="Martial Arts of the World-Silat"/&gt;

Although the word ''[[silat]]'' is widely known throughout much of [[Southeast Asia]], the term ''pencak silat'' is used mainly in Indonesia. Pencak silat was chosen in 1948 as a unifying term for the Indonesian fighting styles. It was a compound of the two most commonly used words for martial arts in Indonesia. ''Pencak'' was the term used in central and east [[Java]], while ''silat'' was used in [[Sumatra]], [[Malay Peninsula]] and [[Borneo]]. In [[Minangkabau language|Minang]] usage, pencak and silat are seen as being two aspects of the same practice. Pencak is the essence of training, the outward aspect of the art which a casual observer is permitted to witness as performance. Silat is the essence of combat and self-defense, the true fighting application of the techniques which are kept secret from outsiders and not divulged to students until the guru deems them ready. While other definitions exist, all agree that silat cannot exist without pencak, and pencak without silat skills is purposeless.&lt;ref name="Alexander, et.al.1979"&gt;{{cite book| title=Pentjak Silat: The Indonesian Fighting Art |author=Howard Alexander, Quintin Chambers, [[Donn F. Draeger]] |year=1979 |publisher=Tokyo, Japan : Kodansha International Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the words ''pencak'' and ''silat'' have not been proven. Some believe that pencak comes from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''pancha'' meaning five, or from the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] term ''pencha'' or ''pungcha'' which implies parrying or deflecting, and striking or pressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Malay Art Of Self-defense: Silat Seni Gayong |author=Sheikh Shamsuddin |publisher=North Atlantic Books |year=2005 |isbn=1-55643-562-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Other terms may be used in particular dialects such as ''silek'', ''penca'', ''mancak'', ''maen po'' or ''main-po''.

Dutch East Indian newspapers of the colonial era recorded the terms for martial arts under [[Dutch language|Dutch]] spellings. These include ''silat'', ''pencak'' (spelled in Dutch as "pentjak"), ''penca'' ("pentjah"), ''mancak'' ("mentjak"), ''manca'' ("mentjah"), and ''pukulan'' ("poekoelan").&lt;ref name="nieuwsdag"&gt;Het nieuws van den dag voor Nederlandsch-Indië 20-02-19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 a magazine calls mancak a [[Batak]] fencing game "with long swords, daggers or wood (''mentjah'')"&lt;ref name="TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR INDISCHE TAAL-, LAND- EN VOLKENKUNDE"&gt;, UITGEGEVEN DOOE HET BATAVIAASCH GENOOTSCHAP VAN KUNSTEN EN WETENSCHAPPEN. ONDEB BEDAGTIE VAN J. E. ALBBECHT. EN D. GEBTH VAN WIJK. Deel XXVI. BATAVIA, W. BEIUNINO &amp; Co. 1881.&lt;/ref&gt; These papers described mancak as Malayan (''Maleidsche'') suggesting that the word originates in Sumatra.&lt;ref&gt;Sumatra-courant : nieuws- en advertentieblad 23-11-1872&lt;/ref&gt; These terms were used separately from silat in the [[Dutch East Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;Bataviaasch nieuwsblad 24-04-1928&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''pukulan'' or ''main pukulan'' (spelled "maen poekoelan" in Dutch) referred to the fighting systems of Jakarta but was also used generally for the martial arts of other parts of Indonesia such as Sumatra and Lombok.&lt;ref name="nieuwsdag" /&gt; Believed to be a [[Betawi language|Betawi]] term, it derives from the words for play (''main'') and hit (''pukulan'').

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reliëfs op de Candi Lara Jonggrang oftewel het Prambanan tempelcomplex TMnr 60005088.jpg|thumb|right|Bas-relief of a battle scene at [[Prambanan]] Temple depicting weapons of the time such as the sword, shield, club, bow, and a [[kris]]-like dagger]]
The oral history of Indonesia begins with the arrival of [[Aji Saka]] (lit. primordial king) from India to Java. At the request of the local people, he successfully killed the monarch Dewata Cengkar of [[Medang Kamulan]] in battle and took his place as ruler. This story traditionally marks the rise of Java and the dawn of its Dharmic civilisation. The tale also illustrates the influence India had on Indonesian and Southeast Asian culture in general. Aji Saka is shown to be a fighter and swordsman, while his servants are also depicted as fighting with daggers. The Indian method of knife-duelling was adapted by the [[Batak people|Batak]] and [[Bugis]]-[[Makassar people]]s. Ancient Indonesian art from this period also depicts warriors mounted on elephants wielding Chinese weapons such as the [[jian]] or straight double-edge sword, which is still used in Java.

The earliest evidence of pencak silat being taught in a structured manner comes from 6th-century&lt;ref name="Wonderful"&gt;{{cite web |title=Silek Harimau Minangkabau: the True Martial Art of West Sumatra |publisher=Wonderful Indonesia |url=http://www.indonesia.travel/en/destination/467/padang/article/74/silek-harimau-minangkabau-seni-bela-diri-minangkabau |accessdate=8 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708113338/http://www.indonesia.travel/en/destination/467/padang/article/74/silek-harimau-minangkabau-seni-bela-diri-minangkabau |archivedate=8 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Riau]] from where it spread to the Minangkabau capital in [[West Sumatra]]. The Minangkabau had a clan-based feudal government. Military officers called ''hulubalang'' acted as bodyguards to the king or ''yam tuan''. Minang warriors served without pay. The plunder was divided among them according to military merit, so fighters strove to outdo each other. They were skilled horsemen with the [[list of Indonesian horse breeds|native pony]] and also expert bladesmiths, producing arms both for their own use and for export to Aceh. Traditional Minang society was based around matrilineal custom, so pencak silat was commonly practiced by women.&lt;ref name="Draeger1992"/&gt; As pencak silat became widespread in [[Srivijaya]], the empire was defeated by the Tamil [[Chola]]s of [[south India]] in the 13th century. The Tamil stick fighting art of [[silambam]] is still the most common Indian fighting system in Southeast Asia today.

During the 13th century, [[Ken Arok]], a thug turned into a self made hero and ruler, took over the power from [[Kediri Kingdom]] and established the [[Rajasa Dynasty]]. This is pretty much reflected the ''jago'' (people's champion) culture of ancient Java, where a self made cunning man skillful in martial arts, could rally supports and took over the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=ilnjEF_7J_MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Para+Jagoan:+Dari+Ken+Arok+sampai+Kusni+Kasdut&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWl-exn_TbAhVIWX0KHVwHC0gQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Para%20Jagoan:%20Dari%20Ken%20Arok%20sampai%20Kusni%20Kasdut&amp;f=false|title=Para Jagoan: Dari Ken Arok sampai Kusni Kasdut|last=Matanasi|first=Petrik|date=2011-07-01|publisher=Trompet Book|isbn=9786029913118|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; His successor, the warrior-king [[Kertanegara of Singhasari]] conquered the [[Melayu Kingdom]], [[Maluku Islands]], [[Bali]], and other neighbouring areas. From 1280-1289, [[Kublai Khan]] sent envoys demanding that Singhasari submit to the Khan as Jambi and Melayu had already done, but Kertanegara responded defiantly by scarring the last envoy's face. Kublai Khan retaliated by sending a punitive expedition of 1000 junks to Java, but Kertanegara had already been killed by a vassal in Kediri before the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] force arrived. His son-in-law [[Raden Wijaya]] replaced Kertanegara as leader and allied himself with the arriving Mongol army. With their help Raden Wijaya was able to defeat the Kediri forces. With his silat-trained warriors, Raden Wijaya then turned on the Mongols so that they fled back to [[China]]. The village he founded became the [[Majapahit]] empire. This was the first empire to unite all of [[Indonesia]]'s major islands, and pencak silat reached its technical zenith during this period. In Majapahit, pencak silat became the specialised property of the nobility and its advanced secrets were hidden from commoners.&lt;ref name="Draeger1992"/&gt;

===Colonial era===
[[File:baliwarriors.jpg|thumb|[[Balinese people|Balinese]] warriors armed with [[kris]] in the 1880s]]
The lucrative spice trade eventually brought colonists from Europe, first the Portuguese followed by the Dutch and British. The [[Dutch East India Company]] became the dominant power and established full colonial rule in Indonesia. Local revolts and uprisings were common, but all were suppressed by the Dutch armed with guns and cannons. The Dutch brought in even more Chinese workers to Indonesia, which brought a greater variety of local [[kuntao]] systems. But while the Europeans could effectively overtake and hold the cities, they found it impossible to control the smaller villages and roads connecting them. Indonesians took advantage of this, fighting an underground war through guerilla tactics. Local weapons were recorded as being used against the Dutch, particularly knives and edged weapons such as the [[golok]], [[Parang (knife)|parang]], [[kris]] and [[klewang]].

During the 17th century, the Bugis people of [[Sulawesi]] allied with the Dutch colonists to destroy [[Makassar|Mangkasara]] rule over the surrounding area. While this increased Bugis power in the southwest, Dutch rule deprived seafaring merchants like the Bugis of their traditional employment. As a result, these communities increasingly turned to piracy during the 17th-18th centuries. Not only was pencak silat practiced by the pirates, but new styles were created to combat them.

During the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial era]] of the 18th and 19th century, the [[Cultivation System|exploitative social and economic condition]] of the colony created the culture of the ''jago'' or local people's champion regarded as thugs and bandits by the colonial administration. Parallels can be seen in the ''jawara'' of [[Priangan]], ''jagoan'' of Betawi, and ''warok'' in the [[Ponorogo]] region of East Java. The most infamous band of ''jagoan'' was the 19th century [[Si Pitung]] and Si Jampang, experts in Silat Betawi. Traditionally depicted as Robin Hood-like figures, they upheld justice for the common man by robbing from the rich who acquired power and status by collaborating with the colonists. The ''jago'' were despised by the Dutch authorities as criminals and thieves but were highly respected by the native [[pribumi]] and [[Indonesian Chinese|local Chinese]].

===Modern era===
Conflict with the European rulers provided an impetus for the proliferation of new styles of pencak silat, now founded on the platform of nationalism and the desire for freedom from colonisation. The Indonesian Pencak Silat Association (IPSI) was founded in 1948 to bring all of Indonesia's pencak silat under a single administration. The world's oldest nationwide silat organisation, its basis is that all pencak silat is built on a common source, and that less functional styles must give way to the technically superior. IPSI has avoided the tendency of modern martial arts that gravitate towards sport. The resistance to sport has lessened over time, however, and sparring in particular has become less combative. While nominally an Indonesian organisation, many of the rules and regulations outlined by IPSI have become the de facto standard for [[silat]] competitions worldwide. Indo-Dutch Eurasians who first began practicing pencak silat in the 20th century&lt;ref name="nieuwsdag" /&gt; spread the art to the west in the late 20th century.

Today pencak silat is one of the extra-curricular activities taught in Indonesian schools. It is included as a combat sport in local, national and international athletic events such as the [[SEA Games]] and Indonesia's [[Pekan Olahraga Nasional|National Sports Week]]. Since 2012, the Pencak Malioboro Festival has been held annually and features demonstrations by the biggest silat schools in Indonesia.

==Weapons==
{{main|Weapons of silat}}
[[File:Kerambit knife and sheath.JPG|thumb|right|[[Kerambit]]]]
As with most ancient fighting arts, pencak silat historically prioritized weapons over unarmed combat. While this is usually not the case today, all pencak silat schools include weapons to some degree of importance. While pencak silat includes a wide array of weapons, the following are considered standard in all classical styles. In addition to these, many systems include a specialty or "secret" weapon taught only to advanced students.

* '''''Toya''''': Staff usually made of [[rattan]] but sometimes wood or metal. Typically measures 5–6 feet long and 1.5-2 inches in diameter.
* '''''Tombak/Lembing''''': Spear or javelin made of bamboo, steel or wood that sometimes has horsehair attached near the blade.
* '''''[[Parang (knife)|Parang]]''''': Machete-like chopper, ranging from 10 to 36 inches long
*'''''[[Golok]]''''': Heavy cleaver measuring 10-20 inches long. The blade is heaviest in the centre
* '''''Pisau''''': Any short-bladed knife
* '''''[[Kris]]''''': Double-edged dagger made by folding different types of metal together and then washing it in acid.
* '''''[[Kama (weapon)|Sabit]]/Celurit''''': A sickle, commonly used in farming, cultivation and harvesting of crops.
* '''''Tongkat/Galah''''': Short stick or cudgel
* '''''Pedang''''': Sword, most often single-edged and either straight or slightly curved. Usually measures 15-35 inches overall with a blade upward of 10 inches long
*'''''[[Klewang]]''''': Single-edge longsword with a protruding notch near its tip
* '''''[[tekpi|Chabang]]''''': Short-handled trident, literally meaning "branch"
* '''''[[Selendang]]''''': A silk that can be used for strangling, grappling and whipping

==Styles and schools==
{{further|Styles of silat}}
Over 150 styles of [[pencak silat]] are recognised in [[Indonesia]],&lt;ref name="JP1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Passing on a legacy |author=Ika Krismantari|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|location=Jakarta|date=5 December 2012|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/12/05/passing-a-legacy.html|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the actual number of existing systems is well beyond that. Older methods are typically identified with specific ethno-cultural groups or particular regions.

===Riau===
Much of what constitutes classical Malay culture has its origin in the [[Riau]] Archipelago, including the earliest evidence of silat. Referred to as [[silat Melayu]], the regional fighting systems of Riau have influenced nearly the entirety of [[Indonesia]]n pencak silat, and into neighbouring [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]]. Fighting tactics dating back to the [[Srivijaya]] empire persist in [[Palembang]] today. Wide stances with the front foot turned slightly inward are typical, developed for fighting on Riau's muddy ground, while also preventing the knee joint from being exposed to frontal kicks. Seizing techniques which grab the arm are common. The most prominent weapons in silat Melayu are the staff (''toya'') and the spear. Spear forms in Riau usually begin with the blade pointed downward. Staff technique in silat Melayu of the Palembang area is said to be the best in all of Indonesian pencak silat. The weapon is made of wood and usually measures seven feet long. Fixed hand positions with very little sliding along the staff is characteristic of silat Melayu.

===Minangkabau===
[[File:Randai Padang Panjang.jpg|thumb|right|Minangkabau ''randai'' performance, incorporating some Minang ''silek'' movements.]]
The [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] formed the dominant sovereignty in West Sumatra and make up the majority of Sumatran pencak silat systems. These styles may be referred to as ''silat Minangkabau'', ''silat Padang'' (lit. field silat), or ''silek'', the local pronunciation of silat. Very few systems in Indonesia have not been influenced by silek, and its techniques form the core of pencak silat throughout Sumatra. It developed as an extension of the original silat Melayu from Riau. Folklore traces this to five masters, namely Ninik Datuak Suri Dirajo from [[Padang Panjang]], Kambiang Utan ("forest goat") from [[Cambodia]], Harimau Campo ("tiger of [[Champa]]") from [[Vietnam]], Kuciang Siam ("[[Siamese cat]]") from [[Thailand]] and Anjiang Mualim ("teacher dog") from [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref&gt;Thesis: ''Seni Silat Melayu'' by Abd Rahman Ismail (USM 2005 matter 188)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Djamal, Mid. Filsafat dan Silsilah Aliran-Aliran Silat Minangkabau. Penerbit CV. Tropic - Bukittinggi.1986&lt;/ref&gt; Stealth and ambush were the preferred Minang war tactics, and they were said to be among the best assassins in the world when dispatched singly. Silek Minangkabau is characterised by its low stances and reliance on kicks and leg tactics. The low stance is said to have developed to offset the chance of falling on slippery ground, common in the rice fields of West Sumatra. The local practice of paddling rafts with the legs strengthened fighters' lower body muscles. Hand and arm movements are fast, honed through an exercise in which the exponent stands across from a partner tossing sharpened sticks or knives. The practitioner must redirect the sticks or knives and send them back at the thrower, using their hands and a minimum of movements with the rest of the body.

There are currently around ten major styles of silek, a few of which like Silek Lintau are commonly practiced even in Malaysia. IPSI recognises Silek Harimau (tiger silek) as among the oldest pencak silat in existence. Silek Harimau, also known as ''silek kuciang'' or cat silek, epitomizes the Minang techniques in that it focuses on crouching and kicking from a low position paired with rapid hand attacks. Sitaralak imitates the power of a herd of stampeding [[elephant]]s. Developed as a counter to silek Harimau, folklore tells that its practitioners were able to fight tigers. Sandang is the counter-system to Sitaralak, which defends against powerful attacks by misdirection. Kumango is another characteristically Minang system in its kicks and footwork. Its frequent thigh-slapping and [[taiji]]-like redirection maneuvers indicate both Indian and Chinese influence. Silek Tuo is considered by some to be the oldest Minang system due to its name meaning "old silek", but others claim it traces to the freedom fighter Tuanku Nan Tuo after whom it was named. All the classical pencak silat weapons are used in silek but the most prominent Minang weapons are the ''pedang'' (sword), ''tumbak'' (spear), ''[[kris|karih]]'' (dagger), ''[[klewang]]'' (longsword), ''[[kama (weapon)|sabik]]'' (sickle), ''payung'' (umbrella), ''[[kerambit|kurambik]]'' (claw), and various types of knives.

===Java===
From [[Srivijaya]], pencak silat quickly spread eastward into the Javanese [[Sailendra]] and [[Medang Kingdom]]s where the fighting arts developed in three geographical regions: [[West Java]], [[Central Java]], and [[East Java]]. Today [[Java]] is home to more styles of pencak silat than any other Indonesian island, and displays the greatest diversity of techniques. Many Javanese schools such as [[Perisai Diri]] and [[Inti Ombak]] have been established internationally in Asia, Europe and America. [https://www.merpatiputih.com.au Merpati Putih] or "white dove" style was developed in the [[keraton]] (royal courts) of 17th century [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]]&lt;ref name="MPSejarah"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sejarah Merpati Putih |publisher=PPS Betako Merpati Putih, Pewaris - Pengurus Pusat |url=http://www.ppsbetakomerpatiputih.com/index.php# |language=Indonesian |accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was not taught publicly until 1963. Today it is the standard unarmed martial art of the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name="TNI"&gt;{{cite web|title=KOARMATIM Siap Tarung |publisher= Tentara Nasional Indonesia |url=http://www.tni.mil.id/view-19916-koarmatim-siap-tarung.html |language=Indonesian |accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes weapons but focuses more on empty-handed self-defense and the development of internal strength developed through [[breathing technique]]s.&lt;ref name="MP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Merpati Putih |publisher=PPS Betako Merpati Putih, Pewaris - Pengurus Pusat |url=http://www.ppsbetakomerpatiputih.com/index.php |language=Indonesian |accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pencak silat in Java draws from traditional [[kejawen]] and Hindu-Buddhist [[Javanese beliefs]] but after Indonesia's independence, some schools have adapted themselves in the context of modern religion.&lt;ref name="Patzold2011"&gt;{{cite book| title=Self-Defense and Music in Muslim Context in West Java in Divine Inspirations: Music and Islam in Indonesia|author=Uwe Patzold |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford, UK : Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-538541-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most popular modern styles is the Muslim-directed [[Tapak Suci]]. An evasive long-range system, it requires constant movement as the practitioner rotates on their own axis every few seconds. Similarly the Setia Hati school is Christian-organised. Rooted in silek Minangkabau of the [[Padang]] area, it relies on kicks and footwork while the hands are mainly used defensively for blocking and parrying.

===Sunda===
Java's western region was the first area from which pencak silat spread out of Sumatra. The [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] pencak silat of [[West Java]] may be called ''silat Sunda'' or ''silat Bandung''. In the [[Sundanese language]] they are generically referred to as ''penca'' (dialect form of pencak), ''ameng'', ''ulin'' or ''maen po'' (from the word ''main'' meaning "play"). Ameng is the more respectful term, while ulin and maen po are of lower speech levels. Sunda systems are easily identified by the prefix ''ci'' (spelled "tji" by the Dutch). Pronounced "chi", it comes from the Sundanese word ''cai'' meaning river water, alluding to the fact that they were originally developed in river-basin areas. The deep, wide stance and resulting gait attests to this, owing to the practice of carefully placing the feet from a lifted position onto wet ground. Today, systems of Sunda derivation prefixed with ''ci'' are found even in the high plateaus and mountain ranges of both West and Central Java. Penca instruction was traditionally done through apprenticeship, wherein prospective students offer to work as a servant in the master's house or a labourer in the rice fields. In exchange for working during the day, the master provides the student's meals and trains during the evening. Penca is characterized by reliance on hand and arm movements for both attack and defense. Compared to other Javanese systems, Sunda styles have less frontal contact with the opponent, instead preferring to evade in a circular manner and attack from the side. In one form of training designed to practice circular evasion, victory is attained simply by touching the opponent's torso. Fasting and [[mantra]] were traditionally used to heighten the senses for this purpose. 

The oldest styles of penca were based on animals and movements of farming or tending the fields. IPSI recognises ''Cimacan'' (tiger style), ''Ciular'' (snake style), and ''Pamonyet'' (monkey style) as among the oldest existing pencak silat. Cimacan is said to have been created by a Buddhist monk.  The most prominent system of West Java is ''penca Cimande'', first taught publicly by a [[Baduy people|Badui]] man named Embah Kahir in Cimande village of the [[Sukabumi]] area around 1760.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cimande |publisher=Cimande France |url=http://www.cimandefrance.com/?page_id=43 |accessdate= 8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cimande among the isolationist [[Baduy people|Badui community]] is said to be much older than Embah Kahir, and is believed by many masters to be the original penca of West Java tracing back to [[Pakuan Pajajaran]]. Cimande is a close-quarters system, with the elbows held close to the body. Students begin by learning to fight from a seated position before they are taught footwork. Arms are traditionally conditioned through smashing [[coconuts]], by concentrating the force of the blow into the wrist. Cimande always assumes there is a minimum of three enemies, but advanced students may spar with up to twelve opponents. As a defensive art, Cimande has no lethal techniques. The town of [[Cianjur]] - seen as the heartland of Sunda culture - is associated with a few systems, the most prominent of them being ''Cikalong'' or bat style. Borrowing its technical base from Cimande, Cikalong was founded by Raden Jayaperbata after meditating in a cave in the Cikalong Kulon village. While Cimande may attack with either the fists or open hands, Cikalong prefers the latter. Prominent Sunda weapons include the ''toya'' (staff), ''[[tekpi|cabang]]'' (forked truncheon), long-bladed ''[[parang (knife)|parang]]'' (machete) and heavy ''[[golok]]'' (cleaver). The advanced weapon is the ''piau'' or throwing knife.

===Betawi===
[[File:Pencak Silat Betawi 1.jpg|right|thumb|Silat Betawi demonstration in [[Jakarta]]]]
Among the [[Betawi people]] of [[Greater Jakarta]], the pencak silat tradition is rooted in the culture of the ''jagoan'' or ''jawara'', local champions seen as heroes of the common people. They went against colonial authority and were despised by the Dutch as thugs and bandits. Silat Betawi is referred to in the local dialect as ''maen pukulan'' or ''main pukulan'', literally meaning "strike-play". The most well-known schools are [[Cingkrik]], Kwitang, and [[Beksi]]. The acrobatic monkey-inspired Cingkrik is likely the oldest, the name implying agile movement. The art is said to trace back to a monkey style of [[kuntao]] attributed to Rama Isruna after his wife observed the actions of monkeys. A student of this kuntao named Ki Maing later expanded on the system after a monkey stole his walking stick. [[Cingkrik]] is highly evasive; blows are delivered as a counter after parrying or blocking, and usually target the face, throat and groin. Attacks mimic the grabbing and tearing actions of monkeys. Kwitang also employs evasion and some open-hand strikes but its focus is on powerful punches with the fist tightly-closed at the moment of impact, mainly targeting the centreline. Force is concentrated into the knuckles of the little and ring finger. Attacks are made with a curved arm; the elbow is never fully extended so as to prevent being caught in a joint lock. [[Beksi]], meaning "defense of four directions", is credited to a man named Lie Cheng Hok. It is distinguishable from other Betawi systems by its close-distance combat style and lack of offensive leg action. Silat Betawi includes all the classical pencak silat weapons, but places particular emphasis on the [[parang (knife)|parang]] (machete), [[golok]] (chopper), ''toya'' (staff), and ''pisau'' (knife). Kwitang practitioners are said to be the best [[tekpi|chabang]] fighters in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title =Betawi pencak silat adapts to modern times | author =Nathalie Abigail Budiman |newspaper =The Jakarta Post | location =Jakarta | date = 1 August 2015 |url= http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/08/01/betawi-pencak-silat-adapts-modern-times.html|accessdate = 10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bali===
Following the invasion by Demak, many families of the Majapahit empire fled to Bali. The descendants of the Majapahit were traditionally resistant to outside influence and as a result, the people of Bali often make a distinction between "pure" Balinese pencak silat and styles introduced from outside such as Perisai Diri. The native systems - known locally as pencak - are ultimately rooted in those of Java, and preserve tactics dating back to the Majapahit empire. They are less direct than other styles, characteristically favouring deception over aggression. Hand movements are used to distract, and openings are deliberately exposed to bluff the opponent into attacking. This approach requires that exponents train their flexibility and stamina. As with Balinese warriors of the past, modern pencak practitioners in Bali often wear headbands as part of their uniform.

There are about four main systems considered purely Balinese. The most prominent of these is [[Bakti Negara]], which is firmly rooted in the old [[Balinese Hinduism|local Hindu philosophy]] of [[Tri Hita Karana]].&lt;ref name ="BN"&gt;{{cite web|title =Tentang Bakti Negara | publisher = Bakti Negara |url =http://baktinegara.com/about-us/#translate-en | language =Indonesian | accessdate =10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another system which has gained prominence is Seruling Dewata meaning "God's flute". Purported to date back to ancient times, it recognizes the Indian Buddhist monk [[Bodhidharma]] as the first patriarch, though not its creator. Eka Sentosa Setiti (ESSTI) was the first pencak silat association officially founded in Bali. Created and practiced in the island's south, it draws heavily from southern [[Shaolinquan|Saolim kuntao]]. The primary stance is the ''ting'' posture of kuntao, also the main stance of Japanese [[aikido]]. ESSTI keeps membership low and does not permit outsiders to view sparring matches. Finally, the Tridharma style is practiced in northern Bali. It utilizes circular hand movements and straight kicks. The ESSTI and Tridharma schools often exchange students so cross-training between the styles is common. All Balinese pencak schools traditionally keep sportive contests and performance to a minimum in order to emphasise combat effectiveness.

===Bugis-Makassar===
The [[Bugis]] (''Ugi'') and [[Makassar people]] (''Mangkasara'') are two related maritime groups from [[Sulawesi]]. The Bugis in particular were renowned navigators and shipbuilders, but also feared as corsairs and slave-traders. Both the Bugis and Makassarese were famous for piracy, though this was more common among the former than the latter. As sailors for whom the knife is a vital tool, Bugis and Makassar combatives (known locally as silat) favour blades. The primary weapon is an indigenous knife called the [[badik]]. Other weapons include the ''[[kris|sele]]'' (dagger), ''[[parang (knife)|berang]]'' (machete), ''[[tekpi|cabang]]'' (forked truncheon), and the ''mandau'' (cleaver). Silat in Sulawesi is closely tied to local animism, and weapons are believed to be imbued with a spirit of their own. Hand and arm movements are designed to be adaptable for use with a knife or with the empty hands. Attacks with the fists or open hands can be modified with a pinching action of the fingers, which has its origin in the pinch-grip of the badik. Bugis styles (''silat Ugi'') are based on these hand and arm movements and contain only limited kicks, almost all of the linear variety. The Bugis ''kekuda'' is identical to the southern Chinese [[horse stance]]. Styles from southwestern Sulawesi generally come under the Makassar category (''silat Mangkasara''). Chief among them are the [[kuntao]]-influenced tiger style Karena Macang and the kick-based Manca Tonaja from southern Sulawesi, which is believed to have Minang roots. The mangrove swamps and rocky inlets along the coasts of Sulawesi served as hiding places for pirates, so silat among the Bugis and Makasar community makes use of and defends against ambush. Countering surprise attacks is the specialty of Silat Tapu, a secretive system taught only to experienced practitioners.

===Aceh===
Located on Sumatra's northwest coast on the westernmost tip of the archipelago, Aceh was the first port of call for traders sailing the Indian Ocean. Local culture and weapons (particularly knives) show distinct Indian-Muslim derivation. Unlike the more typical rattan shield, the Acehnese buckler is identical to the Indian [[dhal (shield)]], made from metal and with five or seven knobs on the surface. The Acehnese are recorded by both Indonesian and European sources as being the most warlike people in all of Sumatra, and this is reflected in the highly-aggressive nature of their pencak silat. Acehnese pencak silat borrows its foundation from silat Melayu and silek Minangkabau, particularly the arm-seizing techniques of the former and the ground-sitting postures of the latter. Bladed weaponry is favoured, specifically knives and swords. The primary weapon is the [[rencong]], an L-shaped dagger used mainly for thrusting but also for slashing. The [[kris]] is used as well but the native rencong takes precedence.

===Batak===
Batak land is situated between the Minangkabau to the south and Aceh to the north, and the culture shows both Indian and Chinese influence. The word [[Batak]] refers to a number of ethnic groups originally from the mountains of [[North Sumatra]]. The term typically refers to the [[Toba Batak people|Toba Batak]] while others may explicitly reject that label, preferring to identify themselves by their specific group. Batak silat is known by different names in each community, namely ''mossak'' (Toba), ''moncak'' ([[Mandailing]]), ''ndikar'' ([[Simalungun people|Simalungun]]) and ''dihar'' ([[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo]]). Mossak is the most commonly-used due to the Toba being the most numerous. While each style is distinct, all share similar characteristics and weaponry. The Batak were historically in a near-perpetual state of warfare with their neighbours, so warriors trained daily for combat. Training was either done outdoors or in the ''balai'', a building in the [[kampung]] specifically made for combat practice. Batak silat is primarily armed, employing such weapons as the spear, single-edge blade, and a short-bladed knife known as the ''raut''. The raut is similar to the [[badik]] both in appearance and in its pinch-grip. The most common target is the opponent's midsection. The weapon is held loosely and used in an upward or downward hacking motion. Once the raut has pierced the enemy, the fighter pushes the knife further in with a palm strike. Unarmed techniques are derived from silek Minangkabau, as the kicks and footwork are well-suited to the mountainous Batak country.

===Maluku===
Pencak silat in the [[Maluku Islands]] uses a wide variety of weaponry, some of which are indigenous to the area. The particular specialty of Moluccan silat is the ''[[tekpi|cabang]]'' (forked truncheon), ''pisau'' (knife), and the wooden or metal ''galah'' (staff). The local ''pedang'' (sword) is long-bladed and associated with female fighters. On [[Haruku Island]], particular emphasis is placed on one-legged stances. This tactic was developed for fighting in the ankle-deep sands of the islands, allowing the exponent to use both kicking and eye-gouging techniques simultaneously.

===Bajau===
The [[Sama-Bajau peoples|Bajau]] are a seafaring people of [[Sulawesi]]. Often nomadic, they were traditionally born and raised on longboats at sea although this is increasingly exceptional as the community has been forced to settle on land in recent decades. Colonial records often mistook them for pirates but - unlike the neighbouring Bugis - the Bajau lacked the organization and technology for piracy. In fact, they more often clashed with pirates than engaging in raids themselves. Their main and often only weapon was the fishing spear, which functioned as a hunting tool on land. The Bajau utilized a wide array of these harpoons as weapons both thrown and unthrown. Their aim was impeccable, having been honed by fishing and hunting. The spear may be of ''nibong'' wood or [[bamboo]], single-pronged or three-pronged, barbed or unbarbed, and tipped with wood or steel. Contact with the southern [[Philippines]] and the [[sultanate of Sulu|Sulu sultanate]] of Borneo allowed the Bajau to acquire other weapons through barter, specifically swords, shields, lances and [[parang]]. The most notable Bajau style of pencak silat is centered in [[Kendari]]. It is characterized by cross-legged stances and rapid turning, designed to be used in cramped spaces such as boats.

==Techniques==
[[File:Pencak Silat Betawi 2.jpg|thumb|right|Disarming a [[golok]]]]
Generalizations in pencak silat technique are very difficult; styles and movements are as diverse as the Indonesian archipelago itself. Individual disciplines can be offensive as in Aceh, evasive as in Bali, or somewhere in between. They may focus on strikes (''pukulan''), kicks (''tendangan''), locks (''kuncian''), weapons (''senjata''), or even on spiritual development rather than physical fighting techniques. Most styles specialize in one or two of these, but still make use of them all to some degree. Certain characteristics tend to prevail in particular geographical regions, as follows:

*'''Kicks''' - [[West Sumatra]], [[North Sumatra]]
*'''Hands/Arms''' - [[West Java]], [[Sulawesi]], [[Kalimantan]]
*'''Grappling''' - [[East Java]], [[Sumatra]]
*'''Strikes''' (hands and feet) - [[Bali]], [[Central Java]], [[Madura]]

===Stances and steps===
Students begin by learning basic body stances and steps. Steps or ''langkah'' are ways of moving the feet from one point to another during a fight. Pencak silat has several basic steps, known as ''langkah 8 penjuru'' or "eight directions of steps". Traditional music is often used as a signal to change body position when practicing langkah.&lt;ref name="PS Body Basic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pencak Silat Body Basics |publisher=Google.com |url=https://sites.google.com/site/sundanesepencaksilat/lesson-description/body-basics-1 |accessdate= 7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Langkah are taught in conjunction with preset stances, meant to provide a foundation from which to defend oneself or to launch attacks. The most basic stance is the [[horse stance]] (''kekuda'' or ''kuda-kuda''), which provides stability and firm body position by strengthening the quads. Other stances may train the feet, legs, thighs, glutes and back. Other essential stances are the middle stance, the side stance, and the forward stance. The crawling tiger stance, in which the body is kept low in a ground-hugging position, is most common in Minang silek. Stances are essentially a combination of langkah, body posture, and movement. Through their correct application, the practitioner will be able to attack or defend whether standing, crouching, or sitting down, and alternate smoothly from one position to another. When the student has become familiar with stances and langkah, all are combined in forms or ''jurus''.

===Forms===
[[File:Silat betawi.jpg|thumb|A ''jurus'' in Silat Betawi]]
Forms or ''[[kata|jurus]]'' are pre-meditated sets of steps and movements used for practicing proper technique, training agility, and conditioning the body. Repetition of jurus also develops muscle memory so the practitioner can act and react correctly within a split-second in any given combative situation without having to think. Either armed or unarmed, jurus may be solo, one against one, one against several, or even two against more than one. Forms involving more than one practitioner are meant to be performed at the speed of an actual fight. Real weapons are used in the case of armed jurus, but are sometimes unsharpened today. The ''kembang'' (lit. "flower") aspect of forms consists of fluid movements with the hands and arms resembling traditional [[Indonesian dance]]. As with Korean [[taekkyeon]], these movements are preparation for defending or reversing the opponent's attack. Musical accompaniment provides a metronome to indicate the rhythm of motion. For example, the beat of a drum might signify an attack. Those not aware of the combative nature of these moves often mistake the forms for dancing rather than the formalized training of fighting techniques.&lt;ref name="Black Belt"/&gt;

===Offense===
Pencak silat uses the whole body for attack. The basic strikes are the punch (''pukul'') and kick (''tendang''), with many variations in between. Strikes may be performed with the fists, open palms, shins, feet (''kaki''), elbows (''sikut''), knees (''dengkul'' or ''lutut''), shoulders (''bahu''), or the fingers (''jari''). Even basic attacks may vary depending on style, lineage, and regional origin.&lt;ref name="PS Punch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pencak Silat Punch and Blocking Techniques |publisher=Google.com |url=https://sites.google.com/site/sundanesepencaksilat/lesson-description/body-basics |accessdate= 7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some systems may favour punching with the clenched fist, while others might prefer slapping with the palm of the hand. Other common tactics include feints (''tipuan'') or deceptive blows used as distraction, sweeping (''sapuan'') to knock the opponent down, and the scissors takedown (''guntingan'') which grips the legs around the opponent.

===Defense===
Defense in pencak silat consists of blocking, dodging, deflecting, and countering. Blocks or ''tangkisan'' are the most basic form of defense.&lt;ref name="PS Punch"/&gt; Because pencak silat may target any part of the body, blocks can be done with the forearms, hands, shoulders, or shins. Blocking with the elbows may even hurt the attacker. Attacks can also be used defensively, such as kneeing a kicking opponent's leg. Hard blocks, in which force is met with force, are most suitable when fighting opponents of the same strength or lower. Styles that rely on physical power favour this approach, such as Tenaga Dasar. To minimize any damage sustained by the defender when blocking in this way, body conditioning is used such as toughening the forearms by hitting them against hard surfaces. In cases where the opponent is of greater strength, evasion (''elakan'') or deflections (''pesongan'') would be used, and are actually preferred in certain styles.

==International competitions==
The major international competition is Pencak Silat World Championship, organised by PERSILAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = International Pencak Silat Competition Regulations | publisher = PERSILAT | year = 2004 | accessdate = 2010-12-21 | url = http://www.persilat.org/Pencak_Silat_Regulation.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; This competition takes place every 2 or 3 years period. More than 30 national teams competed in recent tournaments in Jakarta (2010), Chiang Rai (2012) and Phuket (2015).

'''Phonetically Intuitive English''' ('''PIE''') is a scheme&lt;ref name=pie_scheme&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/phoneticallyintuitiveenglish/using-pie/schemes The PIE scheme]&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Google Chrome|Chrome]] [[browser extension]]&lt;ref name=pie_chrome&gt;[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jafbohhbdpejlcfpkbbpkegglokegjid PIE at Chrome Web Store]&lt;/ref&gt; that automatically adds [[diacritics]] to [[English language|English]] words on Web pages to show [[pronunciation]], intended for English-as-a-second-language ([[ESL]]) learners to learn correct pronunciations as they browse the Web, and for children in English-speaking countries to [[Reading education in the United States|learn to read]]. The free project has been reported&lt;ref name=pcworld_english&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/256680/pie_a_chrome_extension_that_can_help_with_reading_and_pronunciation.html PCWorld (English) story on PIE]&lt;/ref&gt; by ''[[PCWorld (magazine)|PCWorld]]'' and other media outlets and invited to National Education Association Exposition 2013, receiving very positive feedback from educators nationwide.

== Features ==
The [[free and open source]] browser extension&lt;ref name=pie_chrome /&gt; uses [[American English]] pronunciation data from the [[CMU Pronouncing Dictionary]] and a one-page scheme also called "Phonetically Intuitive English" (PIE)&lt;ref name=pie_scheme /&gt; to mark up English words with diacritics. The project claims that the scheme is designed to be very easy to learn.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/phoneticallyintuitiveenglish/ PIE's official project website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the English level of the user, PIE offers three modes, Full, Lite and Extra Lite, to show diacritics to different extents. The Full mode shows pronunciations to a great detail (e.g. even the silent g and h as in "light" are marked with a "silence mark"). More advanced learners may prefer the Lite mode (e.g. the silence marks on w, h, y and e will be omitted, as in "low", "she", "bay" and "take"). Very advanced learners can use the Extra Lite mode, which will further omit all schwa marks (e.g. the second and third a in "Canada" will have no marks).

{{Transhumanism}}

'''Postgenderism''' is a social, political and cultural movement which arose from the eroding of the cultural, biological, psychological and social role of gender, and an argument for why the erosion of binary gender will be liberatory.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author = [[George Dvorsky|Dvorsky, George]]|title=Postgenderism: Beyond the Gender Binary|year=2008|url=http://sentientdevelopments.blogspot.com/2008/03/postgenderism-beyond-gender-binary.html|accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Postgenderists argue that gender is an arbitrary and unnecessary limitation on human potential, and
foresee the elimination of involuntary biological and psychological gendering in the human species
as a result of social and cultural evolution and through the application of [[neurotechnology]], [[biotechnology]] and [[Assisted reproductive technology|assistive reproductive technologies]].&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author = [[George Dvorsky|Dvorsky, George]]|title=Postgenderism: Beyond the Gender Binary|year=2008|url=http://sentientdevelopments.blogspot.com/2008/03/postgenderism-beyond-gender-binary.html|accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of postgenderism argue that the presence of [[gender roles]], [[social stratification]], and [[gender differences|cogno-physical disparities and differences]] are generally to the detriment of individuals and society. Given the radical potential for advanced assistive reproductive options, postgenderists believe that sex for [[sexual reproduction|reproductive]] purposes will either become obsolete, or that all post-gendered humans will have the ability, if they so choose, to both carry a pregnancy to term ''and'' 'father' a child, which, postgenderists believe, would have the effect of eliminating the need for definite genders in such a society.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"/&gt;

==Cultural roots==
Postgenderism as a cultural phenomenon has roots in [[feminism]], [[masculism]], along with the [[androgyny]], [[metrosexual]]/[[technosexual]] and [[transgender]] movements. However, it has been through the application of [[transhumanism|transhumanist]] philosophy that postgenderists have conceived the potential for actual morphological changes to the members of the human species and how future humans in a postgender society will reproduce. In this sense, it is an offshoot of transhumanism, [[posthumanism]],&lt;ref name="Ferrando 2014"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Ferrando | first=Francesca |title = Is the Post-Human a Post-Woman? Robots, Cyborgs and the Futures of Gender| journal=European Journal of Futures Research | volume=2 |year = 2014 |url =  https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40309-014-0043-8| accessdate=2016-06-22| doi=10.1007/s40309-014-0043-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[futurism]].&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"/&gt;

One of the earliest expressions of postgenderism was [[Shulamith Firestone]]'s ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]''. It argues, &lt;blockquote&gt;[The] end goal of feminist revolution must be, unlike that of the first feminist movement, not just the elimination of [[male privilege]] but of the sex distinction itself: genital differences between human beings would no longer matter culturally. (A reversion to an unobstructed pansexuality Freud's 'polymorphous perversity'—would probably supersede hetero/homo/bi-sexuality.) The reproduction of the species by one sex for the benefit of both would be replaced by (at least the option of) artificial reproduction: children would born to both sexes equally, or independently of. either, however one chooses to look at it; the dependence of the child on the mother (and vice versa) would give way to a greatly shortened dependence on a small group of others in general, and any remaining inferiority to adults in physical strength would be compensated for culturally.&lt;ref&gt;The Dialectic of Sex, publ. The Women's Press, 1979. Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another important and influential work in this regard was [[socialist feminism|socialist feminist]] [[Donna Haraway]]'s essay, "[[A Cyborg Manifesto]]: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century", in Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature (New York; Routledge, 1991), pp.&amp;nbsp;149–181. In this work, Haraway is interpreted as arguing that women would only be freed from their biological restraints when their reproductive obligations were dispensed with. This may be viewed as Haraway expressing belief that women will only achieve true liberation once they become [[postbiological]] organisms, or postgendered.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"/&gt;  However, Haraway has publicly stated that their use of the word "post-gender" has been grossly misinterpreted.&lt;ref name="Carrico 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Dale Carrico|Carrico, Dale]]|title="Post-Gender" or Gender Poets? |year=2008|url=http://amormundi.blogspot.com/2008/04/post-gender-or-gender-poets.html|accessdate=2008-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postgenderism is also often used by [[George Dvorsky]] to describe the diverse social, political, and cultural movement that affirm the voluntary elimination of gender in the human species by applying advanced biotechnology and assisted reproductive technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices|last=Aggrawal|first=Anil|publisher=CRC Press|year=2008|isbn=9781420043082|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=349}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Dvorsky wrote with [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] that "dyadic gender roles and [[sexual dimorphism]] are generally to the detriment of individuals and society" and that "greater biological fluidity and psychological [[androgyny]] will allow future persons to explore both masculine and feminine aspects of [[personality]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Afrofuturism 2.0: The Rise of Astro-Blackness|last=Anderson|first=Reynaldo|last2=Jones|first2=Charles|publisher=exington Books|year=2015|isbn=9781498510509|location=Lanham, MD|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

Postgenderists are not exclusively advocates of androgyny, although most believe that a "mixing" of both masculine and feminine traits is desirable—essentially the creation of androgynous individuals who exhibit the best of what males and females have to offer in terms of physical and psychological abilities and proclivities. Just what these traits are exactly is a matter of great debate and conjecture.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"/&gt;

Postgenderism is not concerned solely with the physical sex or its assumed traits. It is focused on the idea of eliminating or moving beyond gendered identities. In a traditional gender construct one is either a man or woman, but in postgenderism one is neither a man nor woman nor any other assumed gender role. Thus an individual in society is not reduced to a gender role but is simply an agent of humanity who is to be defined (if at all) by one's actions.

However, not all postgenderists are against the existence of gender roles in some form; some only argue for the deemphasization of gender roles. People in this form of postgender world would be able to identify as a gender if they decided to, but identifying as one would not be mandatory, and gender roles would have little bearing on how people actually act or are treated in society.

==Future technologies==

In regard to potential assistive reproductive technologies, it is believed that reproduction can continue to happen outside of conventional methods, namely [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] and [[artificial insemination]]. Advances such as [[human cloning]], [[parthenogenesis]] and [[artificial womb]]s may significantly extend the potential for human reproduction.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"/&gt;

Many argue that [[posthuman]] space will be more virtual than real. Individuals may consist of [[mind transfer|uploaded minds]] living as data patterns on [[supercomputer]]s or users engaged in completely [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersive virtual realities]]. Postgenderists contend that these types of existences are not gender-specific thus allowing individuals to morph their [[Avatar (virtual reality)|virtual appearances]] and sexuality at will.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"/&gt;

==Sexuality==

Postgenderists maintain that a genderless society does not imply the existence of a species uninterested in [[sex]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. It is thought that sexual relations and interpersonal intimacy can and will exist in a postgendered future, but that those activities may take on different form.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"/&gt; For example, this theory raises the relationship between gender and technologies such as the latter's role in the dismantling of the conventional gender order.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Designing and Conducting Gender, Sex, and Health Research|last=Oliffe|first=John|last2=Greaves|first2=Lorraine|publisher=SAGE|year=2011|isbn=9781412982436|location=Los angeles, CA|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postgenderism, however, is not directly concerned with the physical action of sex or with sexuality. It is believed to offer a more egalitarian system where individuals are classified according to factors such as age, talents, and interests instead of gender.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Feminism==
In the 1970 book ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]'', [[radical feminist]] [[Shulamith Firestone]] wrote that differences in biological reproductive roles are a source of [[gender inequality]]. Firestone singled out pregnancy and childbirth, making the argument that an [[artificial womb]] would free "women from the tyranny of their reproductive biology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chemaly|first=Soraya|title=What Do Artificial Wombs Mean for Women?|url=http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2012/02/23/what-do-artificial-wombs-mean-women/|newspaper=RH Reality Check|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Christine|title=Why Not Artificial Wombs?|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/docLib/TNA03-Rosen.pdf|newspaper=The New Atlantis|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reading comprehension''' is the ability to process text, [[understanding|understand]] its meaning, and to integrate with what the reader already knows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.k12reader.com/what-is-reading-comprehension/|title=What is Reading Comprehension?|date=2008-05-29|website=Reading Worksheets, Spelling, Grammar, Comprehension, Lesson Plans|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509110054/http://www.k12reader.com/what-is-reading-comprehension/|archivedate=2016-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Grabe|title=Reading in a Second Language: Moving from Theory to Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=prvRHZ7DrIcC|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-72974-1|quote=Koda, 2005:4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504225903/https://books.google.com/books?id=prvRHZ7DrIcC|archivedate=2018-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamental skills required in efficient reading comprehension are knowing meaning of words, ability to understand meaning of a word from discourse context, ability to follow organization of passage and to identify antecedents and references in it, ability to draw inferences from a passage about its contents, ability to identify the main thought of a passage, ability to answer questions answered in a passage, ability to recognize the [[List of narrative techniques|literary devices]] or propositional structures used in a passage and determine its [[Tone (literature)|tone]], to understand the situational mood (agents, objects, temporal and spatial reference points, casual and intentional inflections, etc.) conveyed for assertions, questioning, commanding, refraining etc. and finally ability to determine writer's purpose, intent and point of view, and draw inferences about the writer (discourse-semantics).&lt;ref&gt;Davis, F.B.

An individual's ability to comprehend text is influenced by their skills and their ability to process information. If word recognition is difficult, students use too much of their processing capacity to read individual [[word]]s, which interferes with their ability to comprehend what is read. There are a number of reading strategies to improve reading comprehension and inferences, including improving one's vocabulary, critical text analysis ([[intertextuality]], actual events vs. narration of events, etc.) and practicing deep reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maryanne Wolf|title=Tales of Literacy for the 21st Century: The Literary Agenda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HEq1DAAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-103613-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Initially most comprehension teaching was based on imparting selected techniques for each genre that when taken together would allow students to be strategic readers. However, from 1930s testing various methods never seemed to win support in empirical research. One such strategy for improving reading comprehension is the technique called [[SQ3R]] introduced by Francis Pleasant Robinson in his 1946 book ''Effective Study''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1969 and 2000, a number of "strategies" were devised for teaching students to employ self-guided methods for improving reading comprehension. In 1969 Anthony V. Manzo designed and found empirical support for the Re Quest, or [[reciprocal teaching|Reciprocal Questioning Procedure]] in traditional teacher-centered approach due to its sharing of "cognitive secrets." It was the first method to convert fundamental theory such as [[Social learning theory|social learning]] into teaching methods through the use of [[cognitive modeling]] between teachers and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/c9995ff1d0d7b3127d5e74b302d4f843/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=2030479|title=Reading and Questioning: The ReQuest Procedure - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the turn of the 20th century, comprehension lessons usually consist of students answering teacher's questions or writing responses to questions of their own, or from prompts of the teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pearson|first=P. David|title=The Roots of Reading Comprehension Instruction|url=http://www.postgradolinguistica.ucv.cl/dev/documentos/64,688,Handbook%20of%20Research%20on%20reading%20Comprehesion%201The%20roots%20of%20reading%20comprehension%20instruction.pdf|work=postgradolinguistica.ucv.cl|publisher=Universityof California, Berkeley|accessdate=15 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218000018/http://www.postgradolinguistica.ucv.cl/dev/documentos/64,688,Handbook%20of%20Research%20on%20reading%20Comprehesion%201The%20roots%20of%20reading%20comprehension%20instruction.pdf|archivedate=18 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This detached whole group version only helped students individually to respond to portions of the text (Content area reading), and improve their writing skills.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} In the last quarter of the 20th century, evidence accumulated that academic reading test methods were more successful in assessing rather than imparting comprehension or giving a realistic insight. Instead of using the prior response registering method, research studies have concluded that an effective way to teach comprehension is to teach novice readers a bank of "practical reading strategies" or tools to interpret and analyze various categories and styles of text.&lt;ref name="Pressley, 2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pressley, Michael |title=Reading instruction that works: the case for balanced teaching |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=1-59385-229-0 |oclc=61229782 |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Gl6TWPOE2o0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Reading+instruction+that+works:+The+case+for+balanced+teaching&amp;ots=WDL3X6Gy9_&amp;sig=kgIU6slAZInOJfGqTWuDqFeS2L0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504225903/https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Gl6TWPOE2o0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Reading+instruction+that+works:+The+case+for+balanced+teaching&amp;ots=WDL3X6Gy9_&amp;sig=kgIU6slAZInOJfGqTWuDqFeS2L0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2018-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
People learn comprehension skills through education or instruction and some learn by direct experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, G.E. (2011). ''Literacy in the early grades: A successful start for prek-4 readers'' (3rd edition), Boston, Pearson. pp. 5, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Proficient reading depends on the ability to recognize words quickly and effortlessly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn McCord |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-262-51076-6 |oclc=62108874 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_Hk7-n8i1AC&amp;dq=Beginning+to+Read:+Thinking+and+Learning+about+Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also determined by an individual's cognitive development, which is "the construction of thought processes".

There are specific characteristics that determine how successfully an individual will comprehend text, including prior knowledge about the subject, well-developed language, and the ability to make inferences from methodical [[PQRST (study skill)|questioning]] &amp; monitoring comprehension like: "Why is this important?" and "Do I need to read the entire text?" are examples of passage questioning.&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, G.E. (2011). ''Literacy in the early grades: A successful start for prek-4 readers'' (3rd edition), Boston, Pearson. pp. 205, 208-209, 211-212.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instruction for comprehension strategy often involves initially aiding the students by [[social cognitive theory|social and imitation learning]], wherein teachers explain genre styles and model both top-down and bottom-up strategies, and familiarize students with a required complexity of text comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ula C. Manzo|author2=Anthony V.

The final stage involves leading the students to a [[self-regulated learning]] state with more and more practice and assessment.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} The teacher as reading instructor is a role model of a reader for students, demonstrating what it means to be an effective reader and the rewards of being one.&lt;ref name="DayBamford1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard R.

===Definition===
Reading comprehension is the level of understanding of a text/message. This understanding comes from the interaction between the words that are written, and how they trigger knowledge outside the text/message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Keith Rayner |author2=Barbara Foorman |author3=Charles Perfetti |author4=David Pesetsky |author5=Mark Seidenberg  |last-author-amp=yes |title=How Psychological Science Informs the Teaching of Reading|journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest|date= November 2001|volume=2|issue=2|pages=31–74|doi=10.1111/1529-1006.00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, G.E. (2011). ''Literacy in the early grades: A successful start for prek-4 readers'' (3rd edition), Boston, Pearson. p 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Comprehension is a "creative, multifaceted process" dependent upon four [[Theoretical linguistics|language skills]]: [[phonology]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and [[pragmatics]].&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, G.E. (2011). ''Literacy in the early grades: A successful start for prek-4 readers'' (3rd edition), Boston, Pearson. p 37&lt;/ref&gt;There are 6 essential skills for reading comprehension: Decoding, Fluency, Vocabulary, Sentence Construction and Cohesion, Reasoning and background knowledge Working memory and attention

===Reading comprehension levels===
Reading comprehension involves two [[levels of processing]], shallow (low-level) processing and deep (high-level) processing. Deep processing involves [[semantic]] processing, which happens when we encode the meaning of a word and relate it to similar words. Shallow processing involves structural and phonemic recognition, the processing of sentence and word structure, i.e. [[first-order logic]], and their associated sounds. This theory was first identified by [[Fergus I. M. Craik]] and Robert S. Lockhart.&lt;ref name="WagnerSchatschneider2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard K. Wagner|author2=Christopher Schatschneider|author3=Caroline Phythian-Sence|title=Beyond Decoding: The Behavioral and Biological Foundations of Reading Comprehension|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qWPZ63GezB4C&amp;pg=PA143|date=19 June 2009|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-60623-356-6|pages=143–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comprehension levels are observed through [[neuroimaging]] techniques like [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI). fMRI's are used to determine the specific neural pathways of activation across two conditions, narrative-level comprehension and sentence-level comprehension. Images showed that there was less brain region activation during sentence-level comprehension, suggesting a shared reliance with comprehension pathways. The scans also showed an enhanced temporal activation during narrative levels tests indicating this approach activates situation and spatial processing.&lt;ref name="Speer, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Speer |first1=Nicole |last2=Yarkoni |first2=Tal |last3=Zacks |first3=Jeffrey |year=2008 |title=Neural substrates of narrative comprehension and memory |journal=NeuroImage |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=1408–1425 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.03.062}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, neuroimaging studies have found that reading involves three overlapping neural systems: networks active in visual, orthography-phonology ([[Angular gyrus]]), and semantic functions (Anterior [[temporal lobe]] with [[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area|Wernicke's]] area). However, these neural networks are not discrete, meaning these areas have several other functions as well.

===Vocabulary===
Reading comprehension and vocabulary are inextricably linked together. The ability to decode or identify and pronounce words is self-evidently important, but knowing what the words mean has a major and direct effect on knowing what any specific passage means while [[Skimming (reading)|skimming]] a reading material. It has been shown that students with a smaller vocabulary than other students comprehend less of what they read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nielsen|first=Diane|title=Study shows greater focus on vocabulary can help make students better readers|url=http://archive.news.ku.edu/2013/january/9/reading.shtml|quote=if they don’t understand the meaning of the words, then their ability to understand the overall meaning of a story or other text will be compromised|work=news.ku.edu|publisher=The University of Kansas|accessdate=15 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203182921/http://archive.news.ku.edu/2013/january/9/reading.shtml |archivedate=3 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that to improve comprehension, improving word groups, complex vocabularies such as [[homonym]]s or words that have multiple meanings, and those with figurative meanings like [[idiom]]s, [[simile]]s, [[collocations]] and [[metaphor]]s are a good practice.&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, G.E. (2011). ''Literacy in the early grades: A successful start for prek-4 readers'' (3rd edition), Boston, Pearson. pp. 171, 181, 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Biemiller argues that teachers should give out topic related words and [[phrases]] before reading a book to students, teaching includes topic related word groups, synonyms of words and their meaning with the context, and he further says to familiarize students with sentence structures in which these words commonly occur.&lt;ref&gt;Biemiller &amp; Boote, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Biemiller says this intensive approach gives students opportunities to explore the topic beyond its discourse - freedom of conceptual expansion. However, there is no evidence to suggest the primacy of this approach.&lt;ref name="Beck, 2002"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Linda Kucan |author2=Beck, Isabel L. |author3=McKeown, Margaret G. |title=Bringing words to life: robust vocabulary instruction |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=1-57230-753-6 |oclc=48450880 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidental [[morpheme|Morphemic]] analysis of words - prefixes, suffixes and roots - is also considered to improve understanding of the vocabulary, though they are proved to be an unreliable strategy for improving comprehension and is no longer used to teach students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Matthew M. Thomas |author2=Manzo, Anthony V. |author3=Manzo, Ula Casale |title=Content area literacy: strategic teaching for strategic learning |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=2005 |pages=163–4 |isbn=0-471-15167-X |oclc=58833339 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reading strategies==
There are a variety of strategies used to teach reading. Strategies vary according to the challenges like new concepts, unfamiliar vocabulary, long and complex sentences, etc. trying to deal with all of these challenges at the same time may be unrealistic. Then again strategies should fit to the ability, aptitude and age level of the learner. Some of the strategies teachers use are: reading aloud, group work, and more reading exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gorrell|first=Michael Gorrell|date=2011|title=E-books on EBSCOhost: Combining NetLibrary E-books with the EBSCOhost Platform|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3789/isqv23n2.2011.07|journal=Information Standards Quarterly|volume=23|issue=2|pages=31|doi=10.3789/isqv23n2.2011.07|issn=1041-0031}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:US Navy 021211-N-4528H-004 Partnership in Education Communitee Program.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Marine helps a student with reading comprehension as part of a Partnership in Education program sponsored by Park Street Elementary School and Navy/Marine Corps Reserve Center Atlanta. The program is a community out-reach program for sailors and Marines to visit the school and help students with class work.]]

===Reciprocal teaching===

In the 1980s Annemarie Sullivan Palincsar and Ann L. Brown developed a technique called [[reciprocal teaching]] that taught students to predict, summarize, clarify, and ask questions for sections of a text. The use of strategies like summarizing after each paragraph have  come to be seen as effective strategies for building students' comprehension. The idea is that students will develop stronger reading comprehension skills on their own if the teacher gives them explicit mental tools for unpacking text.&lt;ref name="Pressley, 2006"/&gt;

===Instructional conversations===

"Instructional conversations", or comprehension through discussion, create higher-level thinking opportunities for students by promoting [[critical thinking|critical]] and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic thinking]] about the text. According to [[V.T. Thayer|Vivian Thayer]], class discussions help students to generate ideas and new questions. (Goldenberg, p.&amp;nbsp;317). Dr. Neil Postman has said, "All our knowledge results from questions, which is another way of saying that question-asking is our most important intellectual tool" {{citation needed|date=July 2015}} (Response to Intervention). There are several types of questions that a teacher should focus on: remembering; testing understanding; application or solving; invite synthesis or creating; and evaluation and judging.   Teachers should model these types of questions through "think-alouds" before, during, and after reading a text.
When a student can relate a passage to an experience, another book, or other facts about the world, they are "making a connection."  Making connections help students understand the author's purpose and fiction or non-fiction story.&lt;ref name="Dan Bell p.68"&gt;Dan Bell, The GRE Handbook - The How to on GRE, Complete Expert's Hints and Tips Guide by the Leading Experts, Everything You Need to Know about GRE, p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

===Text factors===

There are factors, that once discerned, make it easier for the reader to understand the written text. One is the [[genre]], like [[Fairy tale|folktales]], [[historical fiction]], [[biography|biographies]] or [[poetry]]. Each genre has its own characteristics for text structure, that once understood help the reader comprehend it. A story is composed of a plot, characters, setting, point of view, and theme. Informational books provide real world knowledge for students and have unique features such as: headings, maps, vocabulary, and an index. Poems are written in different forms and the most commonly used are: rhymed verse, haikus, free verse, and narratives. Poetry uses devices such as: alliteration, repetition, rhyme, metaphors, and similes. "When children are familiar with genres, organizational patterns, and text features in books they're reading, they're better able to create those text factors in their own writing." Another one is arranging the text per [[Eye–hand span|perceptual span]] and the text display favorable to the age level of the reader.&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, G.E. (2011). ''Literacy in the early grades: A successful start for prek-4 readers'' (3rd edition), Boston, Pearson. p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-Verbal Imagery'''

Media that utilizes schema to make connections either planned or not, more commonly used within context such as: a passage, an experience, or one's imagination. Some notable examples are emojis, emoticons, cropped and uncropped images, and recently Imojis which are humorous, cropped images that are used to elicit humor and comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vargas|first=Evan|date=Summer 2016|title=Ha-Ha, I’m Comprehending With Imojis|url=http://www.uh.edu/education/documents/reading-journal-summer2016.pdf|journal=Colorado Reading Journal|volume=27|pages=16–19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830152219/http://www.uh.edu/education/documents/reading-journal-summer2016.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visualization===

Visualization is a "[[mental image]]" created in a person's mind while reading text, which "brings words to life" and helps improve reading comprehension. Asking sensory questions will help students become better visualizers.&lt;ref name="Dan Bell p.68"/&gt; Students can practice visualizing by imagining what they "see, hear, smell, taste, or feel" when they are reading a page of a picture book aloud, but not yet shown the picture. They can share their visualizations, then check their level of detail against the illustrations.

=== Partner reading ===

Partner reading is a strategy created for pairs. The teacher chooses two appropriate books for the students to read. First they must read their own book. Once they have completed this, they are given the opportunity to write down their own comprehensive questions for their partner. The students swap books, read them out loud to one another and ask one another questions about the book they read.

This strategy:

* Provides a model of fluent reading and helps students learn decoding skills by offering positive feedback.&lt;ref name="Partner Reading"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.readingrockets.org/strategies/partner_reading|title=Partner Reading|website=Reading Rockets|access-date=2016-05-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506215551/http://www.readingrockets.org/strategies/partner_reading|archivedate=2016-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Provides direct opportunities for a teacher to circulate in the class, observe students, and offer individual remediation.&lt;ref name="Partner Reading"/&gt;

=== Multiple reading strategies ===

There are a wide range of reading strategies suggested by reading programs and educators. Effective reading strategies may differ for second language learners, as opposed to native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Tanyeli, N. (2008). ''The Efficiency of Online English Language Instruction on Students' Reading Skills''. Paper presented at the International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED), Valencia, Spain. http://www.eric.ed.gov/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=ED504676&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iwai, Y. (2008). The perceptions of Japanese students toward academic English reading: Implications for effective ESL reading strategies. ''Multicultural Education, 15''(4), 45-50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deacon, S. H., Wade-Woolley, L., &amp; Kirby, J. R. (2009). Flexibility in young second-language learners: Examining the language specificity of orthographic processing. . ''Journal of Research in Reading, 32''(2), 215-229.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Reading Panel]] identified positive effects only for a subset, particularly summarizing, asking questions, answering questions, comprehension monitoring, graphic organizers, and cooperative learning. The Panel also emphasized that a combination of strategies, as used in Reciprocal Teaching, can be effective.&lt;ref name="Dan Bell p.68"/&gt; The use of effective comprehension strategies that provide specific instructions for developing and retaining comprehension skills, with intermittent feedback, has been found to improve reading comprehension across all ages, specifically those affected by mental disabilities.&lt;ref name="Berkeley, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sherry Berkeley |year=2007 |title=Reading comprehension strategy instruction and attribution retraining for secondary students with disabilities  |journal=Dissertation Abstracts: Humanities and Social Sciences |volume=68 |issue=3-A |pages=949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading different types of texts requires the use of different reading strategies and approaches. Making reading an active, observable process can be very beneficial to struggling readers. A good reader interacts with the text in order to develop an understanding of the information before them. Some good reader strategies are predicting, connecting, inferring, summarizing, analyzing and critiquing. There are many resources and activities educators and instructors of reading can use to help with reading strategies in specific content areas and disciplines. Some examples are graphic organizers, talking to the text, anticipation guides, double entry journals, interactive reading and note taking guides, chunking, and summarizing.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The use of effective comprehension strategies is highly important when learning to improve reading comprehension. These strategies provide specific instructions for developing and retaining comprehension skills across all ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berkeley |first1=Sherry |year=2007 |title=Reading comprehension strategy instruction and attribution retraining for secondary students with disabilities  |journal=Dissertation Abstracts: Humanities and Social Sciences |volume=68 |issue=3-A |pages=949 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Applying methods to attain an overt [[phonemic awareness]] with intermittent practice has been found to improve reading in early ages, specifically those affected by mental disabilities.

=== Comprehension Strategies ===

Research studies on reading and comprehension have shown that highly proficient readers utilize a number of different strategies to comprehend various types of texts, strategies that can also be used by less proficient readers in order to improve their comprehension.

# Making Inferences: In everyday terms we refer to this as “reading between the lines”. It involves connecting various parts of texts that aren’t directly linked in order to form a sensible conclusion. A form of assumption, the reader speculates what connections lie within the texts.
# Planning and Monitoring: This strategy centers around the reader’s mental awareness and their ability to control their comprehension by way of awareness. By previewing text (via outlines, table of contents, etc.) one can establish a goal for reading-“what do I need to get out of this”? Readers use context clues and other evaluation strategies to clarify texts and ideas, and thus monitoring their level of understanding.
# Asking Questions: To solidify one’s understanding of passages of texts readers inquire and develop their own opinion of the author’s writing, character motivations, relationships, etc. This strategy involves allowing oneself to be completely objective in order to find various meanings within the text.
# Determining Importance: Pinpointing the important ideas and messages within the text. Readers are taught to identify direct and indirect ideas and to summarize the relevance of each.
# Visualizing: With this sensory-driven strategy readers form mental and visual images of the contents of text. Being able to connect visually allows for a better understanding with the text through emotional responses.
# Synthesizing: This method involves marrying  multiple ideas from various texts in order to draw conclusions and make comparisons across different texts; with the reader’s goal being to understand how they all fit together.
# Making Connections: A cognitive approach also referred to as “reading beyond the lines”, which involves (A) finding a personal connection to reading, such as personal experience, previously read texts, etc. to help establish a deeper understanding of the context of the text, or (B) thinking about implications that have no immediate connection with the theme of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speedreadinfo.com/speed-reading-tip-study-7-reading-strategies-read-proficiently/|title=Speed Reading Tip: A Study on 7 Reading Strategies To Read More Proficiently - Read Write Work|author=|date=15 August 2016|website=speedreadinfo.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428221522/http://www.speedreadinfo.com/speed-reading-tip-study-7-reading-strategies-read-proficiently/|archivedate=28 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment===
There are informal and formal assessments to monitor an individual's comprehension ability and use of comprehension strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, G.E. (2011). Literacy in the early grades: A successful start for prek-4 readers (3rd edition), Boston, Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; Informal assessments are generally through observation and the use of tools, like [[story board]]s, [[word sort]]s, and [[interactive writing]].  Many teachers use Formative assessments to determine if a student has mastered content of the lesson. Formative assessments can be verbal as in a Think-Pair-Share or Partner Share. Formative Assessments can also be Ticket out the door or digital summarizers.  Formal assessments are district or state assessments that evaluates all students on important skills and concepts. Summative assessments are typically assessments given at the end of a unit to measure a student's learning.

==== Running records ====

A popular assessment undertaken in numerous primary schools around the world are '''running records'''. Running records are a helpful tool in regard to reading comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How To Take Running Records|publisher=Scholastic Canada Ltd.|year=2002|isbn=|location=Canada|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tool assists teachers in analysing specific patterns in student behaviours and planning appropriate instruction. By conducting running records teachers are given an overview of students reading abilities and learning over a period of time.

In order for teachers to conduct a running record properly, they must sit beside a student and make sure that the environment is as relaxed as possible so the student does not feel pressured or intimidated. It is best if the running record assessment is conducted during reading, so there are not distractions.  Another alternative is asking an education assistant to conduct the running record for you in a separate room whilst you teach/supervise the class. Quietly observe the students reading and record during this time. There is a specific code for recording which most teachers understand. Once the student has finished reading ask them to retell the story as best they can. After the completion of this, ask them comprehensive questions listed to test them on their understanding of the book. At the end of the assessment add up their running record score and file the assessment sheet away. After the completion of the running record assessment, plan strategies that will improve the students' ability to read and understand the text.

==Difficult or complex content==

===Reading difficult texts===
Some texts, like in philosophy, literature or scientific research, may appear more difficult to read because of the prior knowledge they assume, the tradition from which they come, or the tone, such as criticizing or parodizing.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]], explained his opinion about complicated text: "In order to unfold what is implicit in so many discourses, one would have each time to make a pedagogical outlay that is just not reasonable to expect from every book. Here the responsibility has to be shared out, mediated; the reading has to do its work and the work has to make its reader."&lt;ref name="Derrida87"&gt;[[Jacques Derrida]] (1987) ''Heidegger, the Philosopher's Hell'', interview by [[Didier Eribon]] for ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'' issue of November 6–12, republished in ''Points: Interviews 1974-1994'' (1995) pp.187-8&lt;/ref&gt; Other philosophers, however, believe that if you have something to say, you should be able to make the message readable to a wide audience.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Hyperlinks===
Embedded [[hyperlinks]] in documents or Internet pages have been found to make different demands on the reader than traditional text. Authors, such as [[Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr]], and psychologists, such as [[Maryanne Wolf]], contend that the internet may have a negative impact on attention and reading comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nicholas G. Carr |title=The shallows: what the Internet is doing to our brains |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0-393-07222-3 |oclc=449865498 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies report increased demands of reading hyperlinked text in terms of cognitive load, or the amount of information actively maintained in one’s mind (also see [[working memory]]).&lt;ref name="DeStefano, LeFevre, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeStefano|first1=Diana|last2=LeFevre|first2=Jo-Anne|title=Cognitive load in hypertext reading: A review|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=23|issue=3|year=2007|pages=1616–1641|issn=0747-5632|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2005.08.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study showed that going from about 5 hyperlinks per page to about 11 per page reduced college students’ understanding (assessed by multiple choice tests) of articles about alternative energy.&lt;ref&gt;Zhu, Erping. Hypermedia Interface Design: The Effects of Number of Links and Granularity of Nodes. Journal of Educational Multimedia and Hypermedia, v8 n3 p331-58 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This can be attributed to the decision-making process (deciding whether to click on it) required by each hyperlink,&lt;ref name="DeStefano, LeFevre, 2007"/&gt; which may reduce comprehension of surrounding text.

On the other hand, other studies have shown that if a short summary of the link’s content is provided when the mouse pointer hovers over it, then comprehension of the text is improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Antonenko | first1 =  | last2 = Niederhauser | first2 =  | year = 2010 | title = The Influence of Leads on Cognitive Load and Learning in a Hypertext Environment | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 140–150 | doi=10.1016/j.chb.2009.10.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Navigation hints" about which links are most relevant improved comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;Madrid, Oostendorp and Melguizo: Computers in Human Behavior 25 (2009) 66–75&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the background knowledge of the reader can partially determine the effect hyperlinks have on comprehension. In a study of reading comprehension with subjects who were familiar or unfamiliar with art history, texts which were hyperlinked to one another hierarchically were easier for novices to understand than texts which were hyperlinked semantically. In contrast, those already familiar with the topic understood the content equally well with both types of organization.&lt;ref name="DeStefano, LeFevre, 2007"/&gt;

In interpreting these results, it may be useful to note that the studies mentioned were all performed in closed content environments, not on the internet. That is, the texts used only linked to a predetermined set of other texts which was offline. Furthermore, the participants were explicitly instructed to read on a certain topic in a limited amount of time. Reading text on the internet may not have these constraints.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Professional development==
The National Reading Panel noted that comprehension strategy instruction is difficult for many teachers as well as for students, particularly because they were not taught this way and because it is a demanding task. They suggested that professional development can increase teachers/students willingness to use reading strategies but admitted that much remains to be done in this area.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} The [[directed listening and thinking activity]] is a technique available to teachers to aid students in [[literacy|learning how to un-read]] and reading comprehension. It is also difficult for students that are new. There is often some debate when considering the relationship between reading [[fluency]] and reading comprehension. There is evidence of a direct correlation that fluency and comprehension lead to better understanding of the written material, across all ages.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} The [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] assessed U.S. student performance in reading at grade 12 from both public and private school population and found that only 37 percentage of students were having proficient skills. The majority, 72 percentage of the students were only at or above basic skills, and alarmingly a 28 percentage of the students were below basic level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_cnb.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-03-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831085622/https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_cnb.pdf |archivedate=2017-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Reykjavík City Theatre''' ({{lang-is|'''Borgarleikhúsið'''}}) is a theatre in [[Reykjavík]].

== History ==
In 1989, after 90 years of performing in a small wooden building in the [[city centre]], the company inaugurated a new theatre building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://leikminjasafn.is/sagan/islensk-leikhus/borgarleikhusid/ |title=Sagan: Borgarleikhúsið |publisher=Leikminjasafn Íslands |language=Icelandic |accessdate=9 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; adjacent to the [[Kringlan]] mall. It opened with a double bill of plays by [[Kjartan Ragnarsson]] based on works by [[Halldór Laxness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=LG |url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=2921720 |title=Vatnið er tákn Ólafs Kárasonar |newspaper=[[Þjóðviljinn]]: Nýtt Helgarblað |date=20 October 1989 |language=Icelandic }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Characteristics ==
The large new building (11,000 square metres in total), has four adaptable stages. The main stage seats 560 people, a [[black box theatre]] holds 240, a [[theatre-in-the-round]] 220, and a café-theatre has room for 120 at full capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visitreykjavik.is/reykjavik-city-theatre|title=Reykjavik City Theatre {{!}} Visit Reykjavík|website=www.visitreykjavik.is|language=en|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCT employs up to 200 people at any given time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.borgarleikhus.is/en/about-theatre/|title=About the theatre|website=www.borgarleikhus.is|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also contracts international talents for a selection of projects. All elements of production take place within the theatre itself, which has its own lighting and sound departments, set and props workshops, [[costume]] and [[make-up]] departments as well as a technical [[stage crew]]. The artistic director is Magnus Geir Thordarson and the manager is Thorsteinn S. Asmundsson.

The company season runs from September through June each year. The RCT stages 9 to 13 new productions annually, in addition to hosting a variety of collaborations with other [[Theatre company|theatre companies]]. Its audience tallies range from 150,000 – 220,000 per annum, making it the most popular theatre in Iceland. The RCT is subsidised by the City of [[Reykjavík]].

== Productions ==
The company draws on international and domestic works. The RCT promotes a wide range of outside events varying from philosophical debates to [[rock concert]]s.

The RCT also promotes productions by independent theatre groups. Each year the theatre also hosts international guest performances while exporting progressive [[Icelandic theatre]] to festivals and theatres on the international scene. The RCT has collaborated with international companies such as the [[Barbican Centre]] in [[London]] and [[Het Muziek Theater]] in [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Gullager Salisbury.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Portrait of a woman wearing a heavily ruffled [[cap]], 1789]]
In [[sewing]] and [[dressmaking]], a '''ruffle''', '''frill''', or '''furbelow''' is a strip of [[textile|fabric]], [[lace]] or [[ribbon]] tightly [[gather (sewing)|gathered]] or [[pleat]]ed on one edge and applied to a [[clothing|garment]], [[bedding]], or other textile as a form of [[trim (sewing)|trimming]].&lt;ref&gt;Caulfield, S.F.A. and B.C. Saward, ''The Dictionary of Needlework'', 1885, facsimile edition, Blaketon Hall, 1989, p. 428&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''flounce''' is a particular type of fabric manipulation that creates a similar look but with less bulk. The term derives from earlier terms of ''frounce'' or ''fronce''.&lt;ref&gt;Caulfield and Saward, ''The Dictionary of Needlework'', p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; A wavy effect is achieved without gathers or pleats by cutting a curved strip of fabric and applying the inner or shorter edge to the garment. The depth of the curve as well as the width of the fabric determines the depth of the flounce. A [[godet (sewing)|godet]] is a circle wedge that can be inserted into a flounce to further deepen the outer floating wave without adding additional bulk at the point of attachment to the body of the garment, such as at the hemline, collar or sleeve.

Ruffles appeared at the [[draw-string]] necklines of full [[chemise]]s in the 15th century, evolved into the separately-constructed [[ruff (clothing)|ruff]] of the 16th century. Ruffles and flounces remained a fashionable form of trim, off-and-on into modern times.&lt;ref&gt;For styles and construction of ruffles, frills and flounces through the centuries, see the Arnold, Baumgarten and Tozer volumes listed below&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BothSankofa.png|thumb|right|Dual versions of Sankofa. The original is the Sankofa heart. The alternate is the Sankofa bird]] --&gt;

'''Sankofa''' is a word in the [[Twi language]] of [[Ghana]] that translates to "Go back and get it" (''san'' - to return; ''ko'' - to go; ''fa'' - to fetch, to seek and take) and also refers to the [[Asante dialect|Asante]] [[Adinkra symbols|Adinkra]] [[symbol]] represented either with a stylized heart shape or by a bird with its head turned backwards while its feet face forward carrying a precious egg in its mouth. Sankofa is often associated with the proverb, “''Se wo were fi na wosankofa a yenkyi''," which translates as: "It is not wrong to go back for that which you have forgotten."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ctl.du.edu/spirituals/Literature/sankofa.cfm |title=African Tradition, Proverbs, and Sankofa |author=The Spirituals Project at the University of Denver |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=19 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420131901/http://ctl.du.edu/spirituals/literature/sankofa.cfm | archivedate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being used on adinkra cloth in Ghana, the Sankofa heart is a common design on gates in the United States, particularly New York City. In Brooklyn, the Sankofa heart is commonly upside down on gates to Brownstone residential buildings.

The sankofa bird appears frequently in traditional [[Akan art]], and has also been adopted as an important symbol in an [[African-American]] and [[African Diaspora]] context to represent the need to reflect on the past to build a successful future. It is one of the most widely dispersed adinkra symbols, appearing in modern jewelry, tattoos, and clothing.

==Akan symbolism==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 45.11.5 Gold Weight in Form of Sankofa Bird.jpg|thumb|Akan Gold Weight Sankofa]]
The [[Akan people]] of Ghana use an Adinkra symbol to represent this same idea and one version of it is similar to the eastern symbol of a heart, and another version is that of a bird with its head turned backwards taking an egg off its back. It symbolizes taking from the past what is good and bringing it into the present in order to make positive progress through the benevolent use of knowledge. Adinkra symbols are used by the [[Akan people]] to express [[proverb]]s and other philosophical ideas.

The sankofa bird also appears on carved wooden Akan stools,&lt;ref&gt;An example is shown at [http://www.conradiator.com/essays/ghanamuseum.html conradiator.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Akan goldweights]], on some ruler's state umbrella or parasol (''ntuatire'') finials and on the staff finials of some court linguists.&lt;ref&gt;An example is shown on the [http://myfundi.co.za/e/Gold_and_proverbs_of_West_Africa myfundi.co.za page on the gold and proverbs of West Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720175728/http://myfundi.co.za/e/Gold_and_proverbs_of_West_Africa |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It functions to foster mutual respect and unity in tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fa.indiana.edu/~conner/akan/symbol.html fa.indiana.edu site on Akan goldweights] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120802030832/http://www.fa.indiana.edu/~conner/akan/symbol.html |date=2012-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in North America and the United Kingdom ==
[[File:Sankofa Academy.jpeg|thumb|right|The sankofa image has been adopted by numerous afro-centric organizations in North America]]
During a building excavation in [[Lower Manhattan]] in 1991, a cemetery for free and enslaved Africans was discovered.  Over 400 remains were identified, but one coffin in particular stood out. Nailed into its wooden lid were iron tacks, 51 of which formed an enigmatic, heart-shaped design that could be a sankofa symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seeman|first=Erik R.|title=Reassessing the 'Sankofa Symbol' in New York's African Burial Ground,|journal=William and Mary Quarterly|date=January 2010|volume=67|pages=101–22|url=http://www.history.buffalo.edu/documents/SeemanWMQ.pdf|accessdate=17 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611175932/http://www.history.buffalo.edu/documents/SeemanWMQ.pdf|archivedate=11 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A copy of the design found on the coffin lid is prominently carved onto a large black granite memorial at the center of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/afbg/index.htm |title=African Burial Ground National Monument |author= |date= |work= |publisher=National Park Servicef |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] uses the heart-shaped symbol on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmaahc.si.edu/section/get_involved/view/76|title=National Museum of African American History and Culture|author=|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090326185543/http://nmaahc.si.edu/section/get_involved/view/76|archivedate=26 March 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "mouse over" for the image reads: "The Sankofa represents the importance of learning from the past."

Sankofa symbols show themselves all over cities like [[Washington, DC]] and [[New Orleans]], particularly in fence designs.

[[Janet Jackson]] has a sankofa tattoo on her inner right wrist. The symbol is also featured in her 1997 album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', as well as on the supporting tour.

Sankofa is an event used by [[Saint Louis University]] to honor African-American student graduates and students who graduate with degrees in African American studies.

The symbol and name were used in the 1993 film ''[[Sankofa (1993 film)|Sankofa]]'' by [[Haile Gerima]], as well as in the graphic title of the film'' [[500 Years Later]]'' by [[Owen 'Alik Shahadah]].

A UK stage production by Adzido Pan-African Dance Ensemble, scripted by [[Margaret Busby]] and premiered in 1999, was entitled ''Sankofa''.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Brennan, [http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12216869.Rhythms_of_everyday_life/ "Rhythms of everyday life"], ''Herald Scotland'', 10 February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The African-American string band [[Sankofa Strings]], founded in 2005 by Sule Greg C. Wilson, Rhiannon Giddens Laffin, and Dom Flemons, was featured in the 2007 jug band documentary ''Chasin' Gus' Ghost''. The band self-released the CD ''Colored Aristocracy'' in 2006.  A second iteration of the band Sankofa, with Wilson and Flemons, as well as Ndidi Onukwulu and Allison Russell, released the CD ''The Uptown Strut'' in 2012.

[[Cassandra Wilson]] recorded the song "Sankofa", which appeared on her 1993 ''Blue Light 'Til Dawn'' CD.

Sankofa is the name of a Liverpool band formed in 2010. They have released one single "Siren Song" and a four-track EP that includes "Guttermouth" (both available on vinyl and as a download).


A Sankofa bird was carved into the floor of a slave ship by James Keziah Delaney in the second episode of the BBC Television show ''[[Taboo (2017 TV series)|Taboo]]'', and also appears as a tattoo on his upper back.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9920">The '''semiotics of dress''' is a term used to refer to the [[fashion design|design]] and customs associated with [[dress]] ([[clothing]]), as patterned to a kind of [[symbol]]ism that has rules and norms.

The term "[[semiotics]]" can be defined as a system of linguistic signs or symbols.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Owyong|first=Yuet See Monica|date=2009-06-01|title=Clothing semiotics and the social construction of power relations|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10350330902816434|journal=Social Semiotics|volume=19|issue=2|pages=192|doi=10.1080/10350330902816434|issn=1035-0330}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system of signs or symbols is not limited to language only. Therefore, the term '''semiotics of dress''' can be further referred to as a non-linguistic semiotic resource which interrelates with [[facial expression]]s, [[gesture]]s and body semiotics in an effort to develop and communicate meaning.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

However, clothing and fashion are not the same thing, and it is important to understand this. While [[clothing]] is defined as "any covering of the human body",&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[fashion]] is defined as the style of dress accepted by members of a society as being appropriate for specific times and occasions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The [[human body]] is the key element of this non-linguistic semiotic resource. The way one dresses is informed by the biological and social needs of the human being. Central to the semiotics of dress is the psychology of self-perception and self-presentation, both as [[individual]]s who see themselves, as well how individuals are seen within a greater group, [[society]], [[culture]] or [[subculture]].

==Social views==
When the term semiotics is applied to dress, it refers to the words and symbols used to describe the images supporting "the structure of social interaction".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dress Codes: meanings and messages in American culture|last=Rubinstein|first=Ruth|publisher=Westview Press|year=2001|isbn=0813322839|location=Boulder, Colorado|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} Examples of these social interactions include: the system of statuses and roles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|7}} Therefore, the way one dresses can be analyzed as a symbol mechanism to communicate ideas and values with other members in a society, as sociologists [[Erving Goffman]] and Gregory P. Stone have suggested.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

=== ''Symbolism/ideals/values of dress'' ===
According to Ruth Rubinstin, there are three categories for '''clothing signs''': The first, is task oriented or instrumental in nature; the second, is having one primary meaning; and the third, is being recognized as a sign for those who wear it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

Clothing that shows or portrays some kind of authority in society would fall in the first category. An example would be military uniforms, wigs used in English courts, or law enforcement uniforms. People who wear this kinds of uniforms and emblems are expected by society to behave in certain ways. Not only that, but it is assumed that they possess certain economic, educational and social statuses.

Clothing that separates the sexes, and creates differences between a male and a female, would fall into the second category of clothing signs according to Rubinstin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|10}} Sex differences in clothing are due to "Social judgments, personal evaluation and appropriate expectations of dress".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|10}} Because of these, society has coercive power upon colors, shapes and fabrics in the clothes that men and women should wear. Examples of this include men wearing pants, while women are wearing skirts.

Within the third category one may find "seductive attire" as it was labeled by Flugel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|10}} However, wearing sex-specific clothing doesn't necessarily mean one will feel sensual or inclined to have sexual intercourse. Perhaps a better understanding of this could be derived from the church fathers. Who said that seductive attire is a mixture of exposure and coverage of the body. A clothing piece one may use for reference is the ''décollegate'', which was "first in use during the end of the [[Middle Ages]]".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|10}}

'''Symbolism''' in clothing or dress is very much subjective, unlike clothing signs. Symbols in clothing don't represent one's level in a social institution. Therefore, they are not governed by any kind of rules or regulations. Clothing symbols are a reflection of what a specific society believes is valuable at a given time. Using clothing symbols do not imply nothing about a person's rights, duties or obligations, and they should not be used to judge or predict one's behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|11}} Therefore, to understand and comprehend one through its clothing symbols takes time and intimate comprehension of one's history.

'''Cultural values''' in dress can easily increase an individual's self significance by portraying those good, desirable values in accordance with one's society. This can be further explained by looking at or taking members of the [[Aristocracy (class)|European aristocracy]] as an example. They would wear clothes made with expensive fabrics and ornaments, which would differentiate them from the rest. All in efforts to show others that they possess a privileged place in a social class, where they could not be seen working in a field. Therefore, giving the impression of freedom and relaxation from harsh labor, unlike their servants.

=== ''Men v. women'' ===
Throughout history there has been a separation between the roles and relationships that [[Man|men]] and [[Woman|women]] play. These socially structured differences between men and women have contradicted each other at times. [[Fashion]] has picked up on the tensions left by these contradictions as well. The symbolic separation of men and women is fundamental to the history of dress.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Psychology of Clothing|last=Kaiser|first=Susan|publisher=Fairchild Publications|year=1997|isbn=1563671077|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|68}} As time has gone by, the forms of clothing (colors, fabrics and shapes) have changed, but the idea of gender difference has survived.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;{{rp|68}} From an early point in life, children learn to differentiate between a male and a female based on clothing and hairstyles.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;{{rp|68}} An example this may be attributed to television cartoons where superheroines are pictured with strong and muscular bodies. However; due to their clothing, they portray an image or an idea to the viewer of being sexy or attractive, therefore putting her physical strength as a secondary attribute.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|120}}

== Psychology in dress ==
Psychologist J. C. Flugel concluded that styles of dress affect one's appearance, yet triggering feelings that enable role performance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|7}} This means that when an individual's body and clothes fuse together to form one, then the individual's sense of importance increases. Increments in one's sense of importance yields to feelings and behaviors of being able to control the environment in which one is in. At the same time, this may work backwards. In other words, if one's body and clothes don't come together as a whole, then one may feel embarrassed, and therefore belittle its sense of importance. Flugel called this idea ''Image Contrast''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

Clothing can be perceived as one's medium or channel for self-expression.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|146}} Every day people communicate ideas and express feelings about them to others through the use of clothing, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|146}} This way of thinking leads to the idea of the ''social self'', which is that the idea of ''self-reflection'' is a social construction.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|146}}

=== ''Self-perception'' ===
The term ''self-schema'' could be used to defined thought processes that modify, organize and integrate qualities assigned to the self.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|148}} This idea may include visual images or verbal descriptions that people may use to describe which "look" suits them best and which "look" doesn't.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|148}}

Teen boys see their selves as more physically effective than teen girls. While at the same time, teen girls perceive themselves as being more effective by means of attractiveness.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|121}} Recently these perceptions among men and women have changed. Women are increasingly concerned with their physical effectiveness, while men have become more interested in their physical attractiveness. Today, unlike men, women are more critical when assessing their bodies in terms of physical fitness, appearance, health and sexuality.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|122}} But both men and women tend to be equally satisfied when it comes to their bodies and their self-perceptions.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|122}}

{{Serbian Mafia}}

'''Serbian organized crime''' or '''Serbian mafia''' ({{lang-sr|Cpпска мафија / Srpska mafija}}) are various criminal organizations based in [[Serbia]] or composed of ethnic [[Serbs]] in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]] and Serbian diaspora. The organizations are primarily involved in [[smuggling]], [[arms trafficking]], [[Robbery|heists]], [[drug trafficking]], [[protection racket]]s, and [[illegal gambling]]. The mafia is composed of several major organized groups, which in turn have wider networks throughout Europe.

It includes some highly successful groups, including one of the largest cocaine import enterprises in  Europe "Groupa Amerika", and the "YACS" Crime Group, out of NYC. The "Pink Panthers" is responsible for some of the biggest heists ever committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/Crime-areas/Organized-crime/Project-Pink-Panthers|title=Project Pink Panthers/Organized crime/Crime areas/Internet|website=Interpol.int|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its origin dates back to [[SFRY]], which had very low crime rate, as criminals were allowed to live peacefully in Yugoslavia as long as they restricted their operations to abroad, and then bring the stolen goods and capital back to be spent at home.{{Citation needed|reason=This is an accusation that should be *very* properly sourced|date=July 2017}} The Serbian mafia gave many Serbs a perceived way out of the economic disaster that occurred in the country following the implementation of internationally imposed sanctions against Serbia during the [[Yugoslav Wars]]. Serbian criminals have been recruited into state security forces, a notable example being [[Milorad Ulemek|Milorad "Legija" Ulemek]], a commander in [[Arkan's Tigers]], which was re-labelled as the [[JSO (Special Operations Unit)|JSO]] (''Red Berets'') after the war. Legija also planned the assassination of Serbian Prime Minister [[Zoran Đinđić]].&lt;ref name=GRAZ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etc-graz.at/cms/fileadmin/user_upload/humsec/Journal/Stojarova_Organized_Crime_in_the_Western_Balkans.pdf|title=Organized Crime in the Western Balkans|format=PDF|accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic Serb organized crime groups are organized in horizontally; higher-ranked members are not necessarily coordinated by any leader.&lt;ref name=GRAZ/&gt;

==History==
[[Ljubomir Magaš]], aka Ljuba Zemunac, was known as the "[[Capo di tutti capi|Godfather]]" of the Serbian mafia during the 1970s and 1980s. He and his gang operated in [[Germany]] and [[Italy]] during this time.&lt;ref name="novine99"/&gt; He was assassinated in 1986 by his rival [[Goran Vuković|Goran "Majmun" Vuković]]. Vukasin Despotović &amp; Dario Ivišić operated in the [[Netherlands]] and became one of the most powerful gangsters through his elimination of rivals while working as a hitman and took over the drug trade in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Javno1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.javno.com/en-croatia/joca-amsterdam---most-powerful-balkan-criminal_197882|title=Joca Amsterdam – Most Powerful Balkan Criminal|date=30 October 2008|publisher=[[Javno]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug that was smuggled was cocaine from [[Colombia]]&lt;ref name="Javno1"/&gt; and "Joca Amsterdam" became known as the "Cocaine King".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.javno.com/en-croatia/joca-amsterdam--i-did-not-kill-ivo-pukanic_198388|title=Joca Amsterdam: I Did Not Kill Ivo Pukanić|publisher=Javno.com|date=31 October 2008|accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for "Duja" Bećirović as an underboss and later lived in Bulgaria where he successfully smuggled drugs until his arrest in 2002. Upon returning to Serbia, he took over companies by force, utilizing the Surčin clan,&lt;ref name="Javno1"/&gt; (one of three then most powerful "clans" of Belgrade). He was later involved in the 2008 [[assassination of Ivo Pukanić]], a [[Croats|Croatian]] journalist killed by a car bomb.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

[[Željko Ražnatović|Željko "Arkan" Ražnatović]] was a successful bank robber in [[Western Europe]] in the 1970s. He had convictions and warrants in [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Sweden]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Italy]]. However, he managed to escape from several prisons and then made connections with several known criminals from Yugoslavia during his time there. In the 1980s he returned to [[Serbia]] where he became involved with illegal businesses and led the [[Red Star Belgrade]] supporters' group "[[Delije Sever]]" ("Ultras").&lt;ref name="BBC2000-01-15"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/605266.stm|title=Gangster's life of Serb warlord|date=15 January 2001|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The real breakthrough for [[criminal organization]]s in [[Serbia]] occurred in early 1990s, when the [[Yugoslav Wars]] erupted in first Croatia and then Bosnia. The [[Serbs]], [[Croats]] and [[Bosniaks]] fought over territory in [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. [[International sanctions]] were imposed on [[Serbia]] starting in May 1992 and Serbia became economically isolated. This prompted the breakthrough for [[criminal organization]]s. Desperate for money, many former soldiers and youngsters turned to a life of crime.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In 1992, members of the "Peca" gang were arrested in a massive police-operation. One of the gang's members was Dušan Spasojević, who later became the head of the Zemun clan.&lt;ref name="novine1a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novine.ca/feljton/feljton-1018.html|title=U popularnom CZ-u su ležali Ljuba Zemunac, Arkan, Skole, Voja Amerikanac, Dafina, Ceca, a danas su tu Cvjetin, Legija, Zvezdan, Nenad Opačić i mnogi drugi članovi zemunskog klana|publisher=Novine.ca|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A young mobster from the Belgrade suburb of [[Voždovac]], Aleksandar "Knele" Knežević, was murdered in October of that year, prompting a brief, but violent Gang War in Belgrade.&lt;ref name="novine1"/&gt;

Arkan was the founder and leader of the [[Serb Volunteer Guard]] (''Arkan's Tigers''), a Serb [[paramilitary]] unit that fought during the Yugoslav Wars. The unit's members were mostly newly recruited [[Red Star Belgrade]] [[hooligans]] and [[gangsters]] from Serbia.&lt;ref name="BBC2000-01-15"/&gt; Those who joined the unit profited on the battlefields by looting and stealing. Arkan later founded the [[Party of Serbian Unity]] in 1993. By the time he returned home, he had become the most powerful member of the Serbian Mafia. He married singer [[Svetlana Ražnatović|Svetlana "Ceca" Ražnatović]].&lt;ref name="NYTIMES050503"/&gt;

Since the days of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFRY]], the mafia has sometimes been protected in exchange for political favors, thus having a direct connection to their activities. [[Stane Dolanc]], a [[Slovenes|Slovene]], instrumentalized the mafia for political assassinations abroad. In the 90s, the Mafia profited by smuggling [[cigarettes]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[oil]]. Businessman [[Stanko Subotić]] was the person that made the largest profit at this time, as cigarettes and oil were in such high demand because of the sanctions. Subotić's net worth is estimated to be €650 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Berislav Jelinić|url=http://www.nacional.hr/en/clanak/38297/serbian-tobacco-mafia-led-its-operation-from-croatia|title=Nacional.hr|publisher=Nacional.hr|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Milošević's fall from power, Subotić maintained connections with Montenegrin President [[Milo Đukanović]], who granted him political favours.&lt;ref name="BBC2001-06-20"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1398974.stm|title=Serbian gangs richer than government|date=20 June 2001|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1994-2000, illegal cigarette smuggling in [[Italy]] was operated by the Serbian mafia in coordination with the Italian Mafia.&lt;ref name="bbb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region-article.php?yyyy=2010&amp;mm=01&amp;dd=19&amp;nav_id=64597|title=Cigarette smuggling hearing postponed again|publisher=B92|date=19 January 2010|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serb and Montenegrin soldiers who had returned from the front-lines of the Yugoslav wars found the only way to make a profit was by turning to a life of crime. The most common crimes were assassinations, kidnappings, drug and cigarette trafficking, robberies, money laundering, racketeering and illegal software production.&lt;ref name=GRAZ/&gt; In 1998, 350 kilograms of heroin were seized at the Serbian-Bulgarian border.&lt;ref name=CMS&gt;[http://www.etc-graz.at/cms/fileadmin/user_upload/humsec/Workin_Paper_Series/Working_Paper_Anastasijevic.pdf "Working Paper"], etc-graz.at; accessed 8 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Arkanov grob.jpg|thumb|200px|Arkan's tomb]]
On 15 January 2000, Arkan was assassinated in the lobby of the [[Continental Hotel Belgrade|Continental Hotel]] in Belgrade. [[Slobodan Milošević]] was dethroned in the October 2000 [[Bulldozer Revolution]]. However, a bloody feud soon emerged among the different criminal "clans" of Belgrade. The feud grew into an open war in which many of the key Mafia bosses were assassinated.&lt;ref name="NYTIMES050503"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/05/world/belgrade-journal-for-partying-mobsters-the-morning-after-prison.html|title=For Partying Mobsters, the Morning After: Prison|date=5 May 2003|publisher=NY Times|author=Green, P.|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, a total of some €841,000,000 was made in illegal profits in Serbia.&lt;ref name=POLIS/&gt;
[[File:Stambolićev spomenik.JPG|thumb|200px|Monument of Ivan Stambolić near the site of the killing]]
25 August 2000. [[Ivan Stambolić]], former Serbian president was abducted during in Belgrade, just before the federal election in which it was mentioned that he could be included as a candidate for the President of the FRY, and since then he disappeared without a trace. The remains of Stambolić were discovered on 28 March 2003. He was killed on the same day he had been hijacked by members of the Zemun clan. The funeral was on 8 April.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

By the early 2000s, the Serbian mafia reportedly had more money than the Serbian government and was better armed than the Serbian Army and Serbian police, according to [[Serbian government|Serbian Interior Minister]] [[Dušan Mihajlović (politician)|Dušan Mihajlović]], who claimed [[Slobodan Milošević]] had given life to crime-syndicates as a "state-sanctioned mafia". Prostitutes from [[Russia]], [[Belarus]] and the [[Ukraine]] were smuggled into Serbia. After Milošević fell from power, the Mafia began seeking a new contact in the government.&lt;ref name="BBC2001-06-20"/&gt; In September 2001, 700 kilograms of heroin was found in a bank vault rented by the BIA in central Belgrade. The illegal safekeeping was never explained, nor brought up. In exchange for information about Kosovo Albanian terrorists, the Zemun Gang was provided "special training courses" by the Serbian Special Forces.&lt;ref name=CMS/&gt;

In 2011, Dr Gilly McKenzie, an Interpol Organized Crime Unit expert, compiled a "White Book" containing 52 criminal organizations of Serbia, none of which had been terminated by the year's end. In the same year, it was concluded that the Protection rackets in port cities on the Black Sea were run by Serbian, Russian and Ukrainian criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3vv_vK6dIBUC|title=Transnational organized crime and international security: business as usual?|publisher=Books.google.se|accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Zoran Đinđić, Davos.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Prime Minister]] [[Zoran Đinđić]] was assassinated on 12 March 12, 2003, by members of the [[Special Operations Unit (Serbia)|Special Operations Unit]] (Red Berets).]]
Beginning with the [[Yugoslav wars]] and ending with the assassination of Prime Minister [[Zoran Đinđić]] in March 2003, connections between the mafia and the government were obvious and corruption was rampant in most branches of the government, from border patrols to law-enforcement agencies. On 12 March 2003, Đinđić was [[Assassination of Zoran Đinđić|assassinated]] by a former [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[Special Operations Unit (Serbia)|Special Operations Unit]] member, Zvezdan Jovanović.&lt;!--SENTENCE??--&gt; "[[Milorad Ulemek|Legija]]" was also involved in the assassination and was sentenced to 50 years in prison.&lt;ref name="NYTIMES050503"/&gt;

Đinđić had connections within the Surčin Gang that dated back to the earlier overthrowing of Milošević. The government set in motion an operation against organized crime - "[[Operation Sabre (Serbia)|Operation Sabre]]", which led to more than 10,000 arrests. Many New Belgrade malls, locations frequented by gangsters, were closed after the Operation,&lt;ref name="NYTIMES050503"/&gt; 123 criminal groups were shattered with 844 members awaiting trial; 3,949 people had criminal complaints issued against them. 28 kilograms of heroin, 463&amp;nbsp;grams of cocaine, 44,837 kilograms of marijuana, 4,960 kilograms of synthetic drugs and 688 stolen cars were recovered in a single day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/Mesko/208031.pdf|title=Operation Sablja|format=PDF|accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milan Sarajlić, the Deputy State Prosecutor of Serbia was arrested that day and later confessed to being on the payroll of the Zemun clan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/serbian-prosecutor-admits-being-on-gangster-payroll-591762.html|work=The Independent|location=London, UK|title=Serbian prosecutor admits being on gangster payroll|date=21 March 2003|accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 it was revealed that the [[Šarić gang]] had, from 2008–09, ousted the [['Ndrangheta]] from the drug market. With the emergence of the gang on Italian soil, the gang offered better quality cocaine for a lower price, effectively gaining the market from 2007–09, trafficking cocaine from South America. Operation Balkan Warrior was successful in Italy, with over 80 people arrested. Two networks were among the arrested, one Italian, with members from Milan and other northern Italian towns, and the other, a Serbian network, with members from Serbia, Montenegro and Slovenia.

'''Shaabi''' ({{lang-arz|شعبي}}'' {{transl|ar|ALA|Shaʻbī}}''&amp;nbsp; {{IPA-arz|ˈʃæʕbi|pron}}) is an [[Egypt]]ian musical genre. It is a form of popular working-class music which evolved from [[baladi]] in the second half of the 20th century.

Shaabi means 'of the people'. It originated in Cairo in the 1970s, as a new form of urban music expressing the difficulties and frustrations of modern Egyptian life.&lt;ref name="Hammond2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Andrew |title=Pop Culture Arab World!: Media, Arts, and Lifestyle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4eodEw7ZvsC&amp;pg=PA153|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|isbn=978-1-85109-449-3|pages=153–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shaabi lyrics can be both intensely political, and filled with humour and double entendre. Because of its nature as street music, and a widespread indifference to copyright law among Egyptians, Shaabi today is mainly distributed on pirated tapes and CDs.

The first shaabi singer to rise to stardom was [[Ahmed Adaweyah]], whose first album in 1972 sold a million copies.&lt;ref name="Hammond2005"/&gt; Like many shaabi singers, Adaweyah was famed for his [[mawwal]]. 
More recently, [[Shaaban Abdel Rahim]] rose to fame in 2000 with the controversial 'Ana Bakra Israel' ('I hate Israel'), and has remained something of a working-class hero due to a string of populist political hits.

Other well-known singers in the shaabi genre include [[Saad al-Soghayer]], [[Amina (Egyptian Singer)|Amina]], and [[Abdelbaset Hamouda]]. Another notable singer is [[Hakim (Egyptian singer)|Hakim]], who is from a middle-class background unlike most shaabi singers, and whose commercially successful brand of shaabi-pop is generally cheerful and apolitical.

== Mahragan ==

The most recent new development to come out of Cairo's Shaabi scene is '[[mahragan]]' ('festivals'; {{lang-ar|مهرجانات}}&amp;nbsp; {{IPA-arz|mɑh.ɾɑ.ɡɑˈnɑːt|}}) music, also known as 'electro-shaabi' in the West. However the performers use ''mahragan'' (meaning a big, loud, messy event; and a festival) to distinguish themselves from ''sha'bi'',.&lt;ref name="Out of Egypt’s Chaos, Musical Rebellion"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hubbard|first=Ben|title=Out of Egypt’s Chaos, Musical Rebellion|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/world/middleeast/egypts-chaos-stirs-musical-revolution.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known artists in this genre are [[Islam Chipsy]], [[Oka Wi Ortega]], Sadat, Figo, Alaa 50 Cent, Shahta Karika  &lt;ref&gt;Maria Golla,  “Egypt’s Mahragan:  Music of the Masses.” Middle East Institute.

The genre was popularised by the alternative culture magazine ''[[Audio Kultur]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://audiokultur.com/electrochaabi/&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Cairo Liberation Front]]'' and by the blog ''[[Generation Bass]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.generationbass.com/2012/10/18/arabia-rising-egyptian-electro-chaabi/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story, as narrated by the [[Go God Go XII|Wise One]], begins when [[Scott Tenorman Must Die|Scott Tenorman]] sneaks into Cartman's house at night and steals his [[Xbox 360]] hard drive. In fear of losing all their progress in games such as ''[[L.A. Noire]]'' and ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', the boys give chase to Tenorman through a portal, not knowing where in time and space it would take them.

The boys emerge in the year [[Go God Go|2546]], which Tenorman has manipulated into his own image using his new army of [[Ginger Kids|Ginger robots]]. Fighting through the robots as well as some creations stolen from [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto and Kevin|Dr. Mephesto]], they eventually confront Tenorman, destroying a colossal robotic incarnation of himself known as Robo-Tenorman 1.0 before he flees through another portal.

Returning to the present day, the boys enter the sewers to search for [[Mr. Hankey]], who they believe can help them. Riding the [[Red Sleigh Down|Poo-Choo Train]] to Mr. Hankey's home, he enables them to return to the sewers from anywhere on their travels through the use of "brown keys" before leaving the sewers and following Tenorman to [[Pee (South Park)|Pi Pi's Splashtown]], from which they quickly escape after an encounter with a tsunami of [[urine]] before heading to [[Towelie|Tynacorp]]. The boys meet [[Towelie (character)|Towelie]] on their way through (although he proves to be of little use to them as a result of being [[Cannabis (drug)|high]]) and are able to defeat Tenorman's henchman, [[ManBearPig]].

In the county dump, Tenorman challenges the boys to rescue [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], playing in his [[Casa Bonita (South Park)|house of junk]], before he is unknowingly crushed by junkyard machinery. After saving him, they chase Tenorman into [[Best Friends Forever (South Park)|Heaven]] just as it is attacked by [[Satan (South Park)|Satan's]] army of demons. The boys help [[Fantastic Easter Special|St. Peter]] to fight back against the demons, eventually travelling into Hell and defeating the [[Woodland Critter Christmas|AntiChrist]].

After making their way through the jungles of [[Pandemic (South Park)|Peru]], the boys finally travel through a portal to Tenorman's base, the [[201 (South Park)|Chili con Carnival]]. Fighting waves of robots throughout the theme park, they eventually corner Tenorman at his throne, where he reveals a significantly more powerful robotic incarnation, Robo-Tenorman 2.0, and proceeds to attack them. Despite almost losing the hard drive to a pit of boiling hot chili, the boys eventually defeat Tenorman, finally taking back the hard drive. The story ends as the Wise One finishes narrating the story to a number of otter children, praising Cartman, the 'Time Child', for his heroic efforts.

'''''Thieves of Baghdad''''' is a non-fictional account written by Col. [[Matthew Bogdanos]] about the quest to recover over a thousand lost artifacts from the [[National Museum of Iraq]] in [[Baghdad]] after the country's counter-invasion.  [http://www.bloomsburyusa.com/catalogue/details2.asp?type=19&amp;page=1&amp;isbn=9781596911468&amp;cf=0]

== Themes ==

=== Story of tracking down stolen objects ===

Much of the book is an accounting of how his unit set up camp in the library of the [[National Museum of Iraq|Iraq museum]] in April 2003 and tried to recover lost artifacts. He developed relationships with museum staff, and, drawing on his knowledge of ancient civilizations, as well as his knowledge of police work, having been a criminal prosecutor in New York for many years, tells how he and the team were able to recover a huge amount of priceless antiquities which had been looted from the museum in the past days, and even years.

=== Analyze the idea that the US allowed museum looting while protecting the oil ministry ===

He goes into great detail about the theme that the US let the museum be looted while it protected the oil ministry... a version of events that was widely reported.

Bogdanos goes into great detail about why this story is not very accurate. First there are basic differences in the two sites. The oil ministry was a single building, which was bombed and had no occupants by the time US troops arrived.

The museum, on the other hand, was an {{convert|11|acre|m2|adj=on}} compound, full of various buildings,  full of Iraqi army troops, fortified with sniper and gun positions, when a small group of Americans was first sent to check it out. The only way to have 'protected' the museum at that point in time, initially, would have been to attack it, and drive out the Iraqi army .... destroying the museum in a horrific firefight. This is roughly Bogdanos' argument.

After this, there is a small window when the US failed to protect the museum, something he says was caused by planners not thinking that the museum would be looted. . . . they figured the looters would go after symbols of the Ba'ath party, like palaces.

But the US finally did get there... Bogdanos had managed to find a sympathetic person in the military brass, thanks in part to press coverage, who supported his mission, despite opposition from many people in the military, and eventually, also despite a lack of interest or caring on the part of many civilian bureaucrats, even from the UN.

=== Analyze the state of the global illegal antiquities trade ===

A great deal of the end of the book is spent discussing and anlayzing the problems of stopping the [[illegal antiquities|illegal trade in antiquities]]. He talks about how the problem is not just smugglers, it goes into the dealers, the brokers, the buyers, the historians and professors who authenticate stolen antiquities for buyers, museum staffs, and even governments that look the other way, while collecting import tariffs.

Another problem is lack of support for law enforcement involvement in the problem. He points out that many governments have donated millions of dollars to the museum, but very little money has been given to the investigative work needed to track down and recover stolen antiquities that belong in the museum. Interpol, the FBI, and other agencies that could do the work have very few people assigned to the task, and those people have almost no budget to work with.

He talks about his efforts to 'bridge the gap' between law enforcement culture and academic culture, and some of his successes. He also lays out a plan for how he would reform the system... One part of his plan includes having a single binding agreement, somewhat like the ABA code, that standardizes what constitutes 'legal' provenance for antiquities, to be used amongst archaeologists, collectors, dealers, museums, academics, law enforcement, customs, etc.

A '''time capsule''' is a historic [[treasure trove|cache]] of goods or information, usually intended as a method of [[communication]] with future people and to help future [[archaeologists]], [[anthropologists]], or [[historians]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Guzman, A.M. Hein, C. Welch, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282816969_Eternal_Memory_Long-Duration_Storage_Concepts_for_Space "Eternal Memory: Long-Duration Storage Concepts for Space"], 66th [[International Astronautical Congress]], Jerusalem, Israel.&lt;/ref&gt; Time capsules are sometimes created and buried during celebrations such as a [[world's fair]], a [[cornerstone]] laying for a building, or at other events.

==Background==
[[File:Helium monument time capsule in amarillo texas usa.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Don Harrington Discovery Center|Helium Centennial Time Columns Monument]]'' located in [[Amarillo, Texas]] holds 4 time capsules in stainless steel that should be opened after a duration of 25, 50, 100, and 1,000 years after they were locked in 1968.&lt;ref name="helium"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhdc.org/index.php?page=helium-monument |title=HELIUM MONUMENT |accessdate=2008-11-30 |publisher=Don Harrington Discovery Center |location=[[Amarillo, Texas]], [[United States|USA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Time capsules are placed with the intention that they will be opened or accessed at a future date.

One of the earliest time capsules known was discovered in November 30, 2017 in Burgos, Spain. A wooden statue of Jesus Christ had hidden inside it a document with economic, politic and cultural information, written by Joaquín Mínguez, chaplain of the Cathedral of Burgo de Osma in 1777&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/12/letters-found-butt-jesus-statue-time-capsule-spain-spd/ |title='Time Capsule' Found in Jesus Statue—Where You Wouldn't Expect |date=2017-12-04 |accessdate=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
.

An early example of the use of a time capsule was the [[Detroit Century Box]]. The brainchild of [[Detroit]] mayor [[William C. Maybury]], it was created on December 31, 1900, and scheduled to be opened 100 years later. It was filled with photographs and letters from 56 prominent residents describing life in 1900 and making predictions for the future, and included a letter by Maybury addressed to the mayor of Detroit in 2000. The capsule was opened by city officials on December 31, 2000, in a ceremony presided over by mayor [[Dennis Archer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/living/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2008/12/oncall_request_time_capsule.html|title=On-call Requests: Time capsule questions the future|author=|date=|website=mlive.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619062052/http://www.mlive.com/living/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2008/12/oncall_request_time_capsule.html|archivedate=2013-06-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.detroithistorical.org/2012/10/12/future-friday-century-box-prophecies/|title=Future Friday: Century Box Prophecies|first=|last=DHSdigital|date=12 October 2012|website=detroithistorical.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1939 New York World's Fair]] time capsule was created by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] as part of their exhibit. It was 90&amp;nbsp;inches (2.3 metres) long, with an interior diameter of 6.5&amp;nbsp;inches (16&amp;nbsp;cm), and weighed 800 pounds (360&amp;nbsp;kg). Westinghouse named the copper, chromium and silver alloy "[[Cupaloy]]", claiming it had the same strength as mild steel. It contained everyday items such as a spool of thread and doll, a [https://archive.org/details/timecapsulecups00westrich Book of Record] (description of the capsule and its creators), a vial of [[staple food]] crop seeds, a microscope and a 15-minute [[Pathé News|RKO Pathé Pictures newsreel]]. [[Microfilm]] spools condensed the contents of a [[Sears Roebuck]] catalog, dictionary, almanac, and other texts.

This first modern time capsule was followed in 1965 by a second capsule at the same site, but 10 feet to the north of the original. Both capsules are buried 50 feet below [[Flushing Meadows Park]], site of the Fair. Both the 1939 and 1965 [[Westinghouse Time Capsules]] are meant to be opened in [[7th millennium|6939]]. More recently, in 1985, Westinghouse created a smaller, [[Plexiglas]] shell to be buried beneath the [[New York Marriott Marquis]] hotel, in the heart of New York's theater district. However, this time capsule was never put in place.

The [[Crypt of Civilization]] (1936) at [[Oglethorpe University]], intended to be opened in [[9th millennium|8113]], is generally regarded as the first modern time capsule, although it was not called one at the time. [[George Edward Pendray]] is responsible for coining the term "time capsule."&lt;ref name="papers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diglib.princeton.edu/ead/eadGetDoc.xq?id=/ead/mudd/publicpolicy/MC105.EAD.xml|title=Princeton University Library - G.

Currently, four time capsules are "buried" in space. The two [[Pioneer Plaque]]s and the two [[Voyager Golden Record]]s have been attached to spacecraft for the possible benefit of spacefarers in the distant future. A fifth time capsule, the [[KEO]] satellite, was scheduled to be launched in 2015-16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keo.org/Alerte.html |title=Les dates de KEO |accessdate=2014-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been delayed several times and an actual launch date has not been given. After launch, it will carry individual messages from Earth's inhabitants addressed to earthlings around the year 52,000, when it is due to return to Earth. 

It is widely debated when time capsules were first used but current evidence shows it was used as early as 1876, however, the principle is fairly simple and the idea and first use of time capsules could be much older than we currently know.&lt;ref name="rusticstone"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rusticstone.net/all-about-time-capsules-and-plaque-markers/|title="Rustic Stone" article Monday, October 1st, 2012: ''All about Time Capsules and Plaque Markers''|accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a [[Samuel Adams and Paul Revere Time Capsule|Revolutionary-era time capsule]] was found at the [[Massachusetts State House]] dating to 1795 and credited to [[Samuel Adams]] and [[Paul Revere]]. It was previously opened in 1855 with some contents added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/11/us/boston-time-capsule-paul-revere-sam-adams/index.html|title=Paul Revere's 1795 time capsule unearthed|first=Kevin Conlon|last=CNN|date=|website=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; A time capsule dating 1777 was discovered within a religious statute in Sotillo de la Ribera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/espana/castilla-leon/abci-hallan-capsula-tiempo-oculta-talla-siglo-xviii-201711272030_noticia.html?#ns_campaign=mod-outbrain&amp;ns_mchannel=abc.es&amp;ns_source=organico&amp;ns_linkname=mobile&amp;ns_fee=MB_21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[International Time Capsule Society]] was created to maintain a global database of all existing time capsules.

==Criticism==
According to time capsule historian William Jarvis, most intentional time capsules usually do not provide much useful historical information: they are typically filled with "useless junk", new and pristine in condition, that tells little about the people of the time.&lt;ref name=jarvis&gt;William Jarvis (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Many time capsules today contain only [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] of limited value to future historians. Historians suggest that items which describe the daily lives of the people who created them, such as personal notes, pictures, and documents, would greatly increase the value of the time capsule to future historians.

If time capsules have a [[museum]]-like goal of preserving the culture of a particular time and place for study, they fulfill this goal very poorly in that they, by definition, are kept sealed for a particular length of time. Subsequent generations between the launch date and the target date will have no direct access to the artifacts and therefore these generations are prevented from learning from the contents directly. Therefore, time capsules can be seen, in respect to their usefulness to historians, as dormant museums, their releases timed for some date so far in the future that the building in question is no longer intact.&lt;ref name=jarvis /&gt;

Historians also concede that there are many [[historic preservation|preservation]] issues surrounding the selection of the [[Media (communication)|media]] to transmit this information to the future.&lt;ref name=jarvis /&gt; Some of these issues include the obsolescence of technology and the deterioration of electronic and magnetic storage media (known as the [[digital dark age]]), and possible language problems if the capsule is dug up in the distant future. Many buried time capsules are lost, as interest in them fades and the exact location is forgotten, or they are destroyed within a few years by [[groundwater]].

[[Archives]] and archival materials, including videos, might be the best types of time capsules, as long as the medium can still be used, or the data can be read by the latest technologies and software.

==In media==
The 1947 docudrama ''[[The Beginning or the End]]'' is a semi-historical account of the creation of the first atomic bomb during [[World War II]].  The film begins with staged newsreel footage of the scientists and officers involved in the project (played by actors) burying a time capsule in [[Redwood National Forest]] in [[California]].  The capsule contained a copy of the film, along with a projector to view it on, and instructions for its operation set on a metal sheet. The purpose of the capsule was in line with the film's title, about whether humanity will destroy itself now that it has the ability to, or whether it will rise above war as a whole and come together to use nuclear power for greater purposes.  The film can be seen as an example of [[Cold War]] [[propaganda]].&lt;ref name="Inc1947"&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The Beginning or The End|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=60kEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=the+beginning+or+the+end+time+capsule|date=17 March 1947|publisher=LIFE|pages=75–|issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 dramatic film ''[[Knowing (film)|Knowing]]'' involves a time capsule being placed in the ground by an elementary school in 1959.  After staring into the sun, a girl begins to hear voices and later begins to frantically write an incoherent set of numbers down onto a page that she is supposed to be writing a letter to a student in the future with.  The capsule is sealed and opened in 2009 where the character John Koestler realizes that the list of numbers correlates to the dates and death tolls of major disasters, such as the [[September 11 attacks]], the [[Lockerbie Bombing]], and other events resulting in mass death which occurred after the time capsule was buried, after his son Caleb Koestler receives the letter and brings it home.

[[File:Little Miss Muffet 1940 poster.jpg|thumb|1940s poster promoting reading among children, depicting [[Little Miss Muffet]] sitting on a tuffet]]
A '''tuffet''', '''pooffer''', or '''hassock''' is a piece of furniture used as a [[footstool]] or low seat. It is distinguished from a [[Stool (chair)|stool]] in that it is completely covered in cloth so that no legs are visible, and is essentially a large hard cushion that may have an internal wooden frame to give it more rigidity.

Wooden feet may be added to the base to give it stability, at which point it becomes a stool or a footstool. If the piece is larger, with storage space inside it, then it is generally known as an [[Ottoman (furniture)|ottoman]].{{r|TheFreeDictionary.com}}

The term ''hassock'' has a special association with churches, where it is used to describe the thick cushions (also called [[kneeler|kneelers]]) employed by the congregation to kneel on while in prayer.

==Etymology==

The names ''tuffet'' and ''hassock'' are both derived from English names for "a small grassy [[hillock]] or clump of grass", in use since at least the sixteenth century. The word ''tuffet'' comes from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] {{lang|xno|tuffete}}, from *''tufe'' "tuft".{{r|Merrian-Webster online}} The first known use of the word ''tuffet'' was in 1553.{{r|Merrian-Webster online}}

''[[Chambers 20th Century Dictionary]]'' does not recognize the use of "tuffet" for a piece of furniture,{{r|Chambers}} and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' says that it only "perhaps" means hassock or footstool, suggesting that this usage is due to a misunderstanding of the nursery rhyme "[[Little Miss Muffet]]".{{r|OED online}}

''Pouffe'' is a nineteenth-century French import for "something puffed out".

The '''[[phonology]] of [[Welsh language|Welsh]]''' is characterised by a number of sounds that do not occur in [[English language|English]] and are rare in [[Languages of Europe|European languages]], such as the [[Voiceless dental and alveolar lateral fricatives|voiceless alveolar lateral fricative]] {{IPA|[ɬ]}} and several [[Sonorant#Voiceless|voiceless sonorants]] ([[nasal consonant|nasals]] and [[liquid consonant|liquids]]), some of which result from [[Colloquial Welsh morphology#Initial consonant mutation|consonant mutation]]. [[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] usually falls on the penultimate syllable in polysyllabic words, while the word-final unstressed syllable receives a higher [[Pitch accent|pitch]] than the stressed syllable.

==Consonants==

Symbols in parentheses are either [[allophone]]s, or found only in [[loanword]]s. The sound {{IPA|/z/}} generally occurs in loanwords, e.g. ''sw'' {{IPA|/zuː/}} ('zoo'), although this is usually realised as {{IPA|/s/}} in [[Welsh language#Dialects|northern accents]], e.g. {{IPA|/suː/}}.  The postalveolar affricates {{IPA|/tʃ/}} and {{IPA|/dʒ/}} occur mainly in loanwords, e.g. {{lang|cy|tships}} {{IPA|/tʃɪps/}} ('chips')  and {{lang|cy|jeli}} {{IPA|/ˈdʒɛli/}} ('[[gelatin dessert|jelly]]'), but also in some dialects as developments from {{IPA|/tj/}} and {{IPA|/dj/}}, e.g. {{IPA|/dʒaul/}} from {{lang|cy|diafol}} {{IPA|/ˈdjavɔl/}} ('devil'). The [[Nasal consonant#Voiceless nasals|voiceless nasals]] {{IPA|/m̥ n̥ ŋ̊/}} occur mostly word-initially, as a consequence of [[Welsh morphology#Nasal mutation|nasal mutation]]. Initial {{IPA|/χw/}} (or {{IPA|/χʷ/}}) is colloquially realised as {{IPA|[ʍ]}} in the south, e.g. {{lang|cy|chwech}} {{IPA|/χweːχ/}} ('six') pronounced {{IPA|[ʍeːχ]}}.

{{IPA|[ç]}} results from {{IPA|/j/}} when preceded by {{IPA|/h/}}, often as a result of [[h-prothesis|''h''-prothesis]] of the radical word, e.g. {{lang|cy|iaith}} {{IPA|/jai̯θ/}} 'language' becomes {{lang|cy|ei hiaith}} {{IPA|[ɛi çai̯θ]}} 'her language'.&lt;ref name="Watkins 1993" /&gt; It also occurs in some Northern dialects as the cluster {{IPA|/çj/}} in place of intervocalic {{IPA|/ɬ/}} in words like {{lang|cy|allan}} ('out') where it is pronounced {{IPA|[açjan]}} rather than the more common (and standard) {{IPA|[aɬan]}}.

The stops {{IPA|/p t k/}} are distinguished from {{IPA|/b d ɡ/}} by means of [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] more consistently than by [[voicing (phonetics)|voicing]], as {{IPA|/b d ɡ/}} are actually devoiced in most contexts. This devoiced nature is recognised in the spelling of {{IPA|/sp sk/}} as {{angbr|sb sg}}, although {{IPA|/st/}} is orthographically {{angbr|st}} for historical reasons.

The fricatives {{IPA|/v ð/}} may also be devoiced in some contexts, but are distinguished from {{IPA|/f θ/}} by having a shorter frication length than the latter. There is a tendency in the spoken language not to pronounce these voiced fricatives in certain contexts, e.g. {{lang|cy|nesaf}} {{IPA|/nɛsav/}} ('next') realised as {{IPA|/ˈnɛsa/}} or {{lang|cy|i fyny}} {{IPA|/iː ˈvənɨ/}} ('up') from {{lang|cy|mynydd}} {{IPA|/mənɨð, mənɪð/}} ('mountain'). Historically, this occurred so often with the [[voiced uvular fricative]] that it disappeared entirely from the language. Some speakers realise the voiceless lateral fricative {{IPA|/ɬ/}} as an [[voiceless palatal fricative]] {{IPA|[ç]}} in some or all contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=John C. Wells|title=Welsh ll|date=26 June 2008|work=John Wells's phonetic blog|accessdate=15 July 2013|url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/blog0806b.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The occurrence and distribution of the phoneme {{IPA|/ʃ/}} varies from area to area. Very few native words are pronounced with {{IPA|/ʃ/}} by all speakers, e.g. {{lang|cy|siarad}} {{IPA|/ˈʃarad/}} ('talk'), although it appears in borrowings, e.g. {{lang|cy|siop}} {{IPA|/ʃɔp/}} ('shop'). In [[Welsh language#Dialects|northern accents]], it can occur when {{IPA|/s/}} precedes {{IPA|/iː j/}} or {{IPA|/j/}}, e.g. {{lang|cy|mi es i}} {{IPA|/mi ˈeːʃ iː/}} ('I went'). In some [[Welsh language#Dialects|southern dialects]] it is produced when {{IPA|/s/}} follows {{IPA|/ɪ/}} or {{IPA|/iː/}}, e.g. {{lang|cy|mis}} {{IPA|/miːʃ/}} ('month'). The voiceless fricative {{IPA|/χ/}} is realised as uvular except by some southwestern speakers, who produce the sound in the velar region as {{IPA|[x]}}.

The {{IPA|/r/}} phoneme is reportedly pronounced as a [[voiced uvular fricative]] by some speakers in [[Dyfed]] and [[Gwynedd]], in a pronunciation known as ''tafod tew'' ('thick tongue').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=John C. Wells|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a3-ElL71fikC|title=Accents of English|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1982|page=390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In northern Welsh, the [[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar lateral approximants|alveolar lateral approximant]] is consistently [[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar lateral approximants#Dark L|velarised]] or "dark" in all positions, but remains unvelarised or "clear" in the south.

==Vowels==
[[File:Welsh vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.36|A chart plotting the vowel [[formant]]s of a Welsh speaker from [[Bangor, Gwynedd]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Martin J.

Jones|location=Cardiff|publisher=University of Wales Press|pages=5–39|isbn=0-7083-0861-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The vowel phonemes of Welsh are as follows:&lt;ref name="Jones 1984" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! rowspan="2" |
! colspan="2" | [[Front vowel|Front]]

|-
! &lt;small&gt;short&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;long&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;short&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;long&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;short&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;long&lt;/small&gt;
|-
! [[Close vowel|Close]]

|-

|-
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
| || | || {{IPA|a}} || {{IPA|aː}} || ||
|}

The vowels {{IPA|/ɨ/}} and {{IPA|/ɨː/}} survive from Old Welsh only in northern dialects; in southern dialects, these vowels have become {{IPA|/ɪ/}} and {{IPA|/iː/}} respectively. In all dialects, the contrast between long and short vowels is found in stressed word-final syllables (mainly monosyllabic words), whereas in some southern dialects, the contrast is found in stressed non-word-final syllables in addition.

The vowel {{IPA|/ə/}} does not occur in the final syllable of words (except a few monosyllabic [[proclitic]]s). It is always pronounced short except when emphasised in the name of the letter {{lang|cy|y}}.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Qualities and the Origins of the Welsh Vowel [ɨː]|last=Wmffre|first=Iwan|publisher=curach bhán publications|year=2013|isbn=9783942002127|location=Berlin|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long counterpart to short {{IPA|/a/}} is sometimes misleadingly transcribed {{IPA|/ɑ/}}. This is often found in solely quality-distinctive transcriptions to avoid using a length mark. The actual pronunciation of long {{IPA|/a/}} is {{IPA|[aː]}}, which makes the vowel pair unique in that there is no significant quality difference. Regional realisations of {{IPA|/aː/}} may be {{IPA|[æː]}} or  {{IPA|[ɛː]}} in north-central and (decreasingly) south-eastern Wales or sporadically as {{IPA|[ɑː]}} in some southern areas undoubtedly under the influence of English.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

|}

The diphthongs containing {{IPA|/ɨ/}} occur only in northern dialects; in southern dialects {{IPA|/ʊɨ/}} is replaced by {{IPA|/ʊi/}}, {{IPA|/ɨu, əɨ~ɛɨ, ɔɨ/}} are merged with {{IPA|/ɪu, əi~ɛi, ɔi/}}, and {{IPA|/aɨ, ɑːɨ/}} are merged with {{IPA|/ai/}}. There is a general tendency in the South to simplify diphthongs in everyday speech, e.g. Northern {{IPA|/ɡwɑːɨθ/}} corresponding to {{IPA|/ɡwaːθ/}} in the South, or Northern {{IPA|/ɡwɛiθjɔ/}} and Southern {{IPA|/ɡwiθɔ/}}.

==Stress and pitch==
[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] in polysyllabic words occurs most commonly on the [[wikt:penultimate|penultimate]] [[syllable]], more rarely on the final syllable (e.g. verbs ending in -áu).&lt;ref name="Williams 1983" /&gt; Exceptions can arise in relation to borrowings from foreign words, such as {{lang|cy|ambiwlans}} and {{lang|cy|testament}}, and words with an epenthetic echo vowel such as {{lang|cy|cenedl}} {{IPA|/ˈkɛnɛdɛl/}}. According to its positioning, related words or concepts (or even [[plural]]s) can sound quite different, as syllables are added to the end of a word and the stress moves correspondingly:

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| style="text-align: left;" | || style="text-align: left;" | || style="text-align: left;" |
|-
| {{lang|cy|ysgrif}}
| style="text-align: left;" | {{IPA|/ˈəsɡriv/}} || "article, essay"
|-
| {{lang|cy|ysgrifen}}
| style="text-align: left;" | {{IPA|/əsˈɡriven/}} || "writing"
|-
| {{lang|cy|ysgrifennydd}}
| style="text-align: left;" | {{IPA|/əsɡriˈvenɨð/}} || "secretary"
|-
| {{lang|cy|ysgrifenyddes}}
| style="text-align: left;" | {{IPA|/əsɡriveˈnəðes/}} || "female secretary"
|-
| {{lang|cy|ysgrifenyddesau}}
| style="text-align: left;" | {{IPA|/əsɡrivenəˈðesaɨ/}} || "female secretaries"
|}

Note also how adding a syllable to {{lang|cy|ysgrifennydd}} to form {{lang|cy|ysgrifenyddes}} changes the pronunciation of the second {{angbr|y}}. This is because the pronunciation of {{angbr|y}} depends on whether or not it is in the final syllable.

Stress on penultimate syllables is characterised by a low [[Pitch accent|pitch]], which is followed by a high pitch on the (unstressed) word-final syllable. In words where stress is on the final syllable, that syllable also bears the high pitch.&lt;ref name="Williams 1983"&gt;{{citation|author=Briony J. Williams|year=1983|title=Stress in Modern Welsh|type=Ph.D.|publisher=University of Cambridge|postscript=. Distributed by Indiana University Linguistics Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; This high pitch is a remnant of the high-pitched word-final stress of early [[Old Welsh]] (derived from original penultimate stress in [[Common Brittonic]] by the loss of final syllables); the stress shift from final to penultimate occurred in the Old Welsh period without affecting the overall pitch of the word.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.pwf.cam.ac.uk/dwew2/old_and_middle_welsh.pdf Old and Middle Welsh], David Willis, University of Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:WetBarandKitchen.jpg|thumb|300px|A wet bar with a bar [[fridge]] adjoining a kitchen]]
A '''wet bar''' is a small [[bar (counter)|bar]] used for mixing [[alcoholic beverage]]s, which differs from a regular bar in that it includes a [[sink]] with running [[water]]. A wet bar can increase the rate at which drinks are served because of the sink, which allows for glasses to be cleaned immediately. The sink may also be used for adding water to drinks.

Wet bars are found in homes for entertainment purposes. A finished basement is a typical location for a wet bar. Wet bars are relatively simple to build, and, thus, many homeowners have turned the wet bar into a [[do-it-yourself]] project. Recently,{{when|date=February 2017}} hotels have been incorporating wet bars into rooms, in which case the customer must pay to use the wet bar per drink.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Including a refrigerator beneath the bar or cabinet is a popular option. This is useful for making chilled drinks and preserving previously made mixtures.

==Etymology==
{{lang|qu|Yachay}} is the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] word for knowledge. It is derived from the verb {{lang|qu|yacha|italic=yes}} (know), specifically referring to ritual knowledge. Similarly, the word for [[shaman]] is {{lang|qu|yachak|italic=yes}}, or one who knows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Beyer|first = Stephan V.|title = Singing to the Plants: A Guide to Mestizo Shamanism in the Upper Amazon|publisher = University of New Mexico Press|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0-8263-4730-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shamans believe that they can regurgitate the spirit at will and pass it on to a [[Apprenticeship|disciple]]. The disciple either receives the {{lang|qu|mariri|italic=yes}} by swallowing the regurgitated substance from the hands of the shaman or by smoking it through a pipe. It is also believed that {{lang|qu|mariri|italic=yes}} can be given to someone from nature spirits, such as the {{lang|qu|[[ayahuasca]]|italic=yes}} [[plant spirit]].

Shamans use {{lang|qu|mariri|italic=yes}} as a defense and protection in acts of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], it is also considered a powerful healer.

'''Yennayer''' is the first month of the [[Berbers|Berber]] [[Year]] ({{lang-ber|Aseggwas Amaziɣ|script=Latn}}, {{lang|ber|ⴰⵙⴻⴳⴳⵯⴰⵙ ⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵗ}}) or the agrarian Berber year used since antiquity by the Berbers in North Africa. Its first day corresponds to the first day of January of the [[Julian Calendar]], which is shifted thirteen days compared to the [[Gregorian calendar]], i.e. 14 January of every year.

Probably due to a mistake of the first cultural associations asking to return to this traditional celebration, the opinion that the traditional date is 13 January is very widespread specially in [[Morocco]], [[Libya]] and [[Canary Islands]]. Whereas in [[Algeria]] is 12 January. On 27 December 2017, Algeria's President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] decided to recognize Yennayer as a public holiday celebrated on 12 January of every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20171228-algeria-sets-berber-new-year-as-public-holiday/|title=Algeria sets Berber New Year as public holiday|work=Middle East Monitor|date=28 December 2017|access-date=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
In 1968, the [[Berber Academy]] proposed to inaugurate a "Berber Era", after the [[Christian era]] and the [[Islamic calendar]]. It fixed as year one of the Berber calendar the first known manifestations of the Berber civilization, in the [[Ancient Egypt]], when the Berber [[Libya]]n [[Shoshenq I]] (Cacnaq, founder of the [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|22nd Egyptian dynasty]]) took the throne and became a Pharaoh in [[ancient Egypt]].

== Etymology ==
Yennayer is the Berber form of January, cognate with Italian ''gennaio'' and Spanish ''enero''.

== The celebration and the tradition ==
Yennayer is a very widespread in the [[Berber world]]. It is considered as national celebration. The Berber year 2968 corresponds to 2018.

== Imensi umenzu n yennayer (Dinner of the first day of January) ==
The meal prepared for this circumstance is hearty and different from the everyday ones. The rites are done in a symbolic manner. They aim to eliminate the [[famine]], to augur the future and the change, and to warm welcome the invisible forces the Berber believed in.

For the preparation of  " imensi n yennayer ", the Kabyle uses the meat of the sacrificed animal (asfel) to complement the [[couscous]], fundamental element of the berber culinary art.

== An opportunity to exchange wishes for prosperity ==
Yennayer symbolizes longevity, and it is often the occasion to include other familiar events: 
* First hair cut for little boys.  
* Marriage under the good omen of Yennayer.  
* Agricultural initiation rites: The Berbers send their children to the farm to pick themselves fruits and vegetables.

==Plot==
Jimmy and Gretchen meet at the wedding of Vernon and Becca Barbara. Jimmy, whom Becca turned down when he proposed two years earlier, is convinced Becca only invited him to rub her marriage to Vernon in his face. He nevertheless showed up, determined to ruin Becca's day as payback. Gretchen came as the guest of Becca's sister, Lindsay, who is Gretchen's best friend and enabler of her sex, drugs and rock-and-roll lifestyle. Gretchen is the publicist for a rap trio and lives in a chaotic apartment, while Jimmy can support himself in upscale [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake]] and drive a BMW, despite having published only one novel, written during his post-breakup depression, that has sold little and been remaindered at the local bookstore. He supports himself by writing for glossy magazines, in addition to the tiny royalty checks that occasionally arrive in his mailbox.

He and Gretchen meet as Jimmy is being thrown out of the wedding reception after whispering something offensive to Becca, while Gretchen has decided to run off with one of the bride's wrapped gifts, which turns out to be a blender, instead of a food processor, to her disappointment. Claiming to have no interest in a relationship, the two hook up that night. Over the next few weeks, despite setting out to just "hang out and have fun" without obligation, they find themselves coming closer together.

In a parallel story, Lindsay is married to Paul, her affluent, conventional husband. Paul is a decent but plain man with somewhat nerdy interests, including astronomy, beer brewing and cycling. The loveless marriage was mainly an attempt by Lindsay to outdo her older sister Becca by getting married first and having more material goods. The marriage falls apart when Lindsay returns to taking drugs and drinking, and cheats with another man. For her part, Becca is no happier with her husband Vernon, an immature man who is only interested in hanging out with friends in his man cave, drinking and watching sports and videos.

Jimmy also has a friend named Edgar, an [[Iraq War]] veteran suffering from [[Post Traumatic Stress Disorder|PTSD]], living in his house. Throughout the first season, it is hinted that Jimmy expected the arrangement to be temporary and he sometimes wonders aloud when Edgar will move out. As time goes on, it becomes clear that Jimmy has come to rely on Edgar's housework and cooking, as well as his friendship.

'''Youth square dancing''' is [[square dancing]] among people up to their mid-twenties.  In specific contexts, e.g., in qualification for some event, it may refer to dancers up to a particular age such as 18.  It also may refer to a style of dancing that, while most popular among younger dancers, can be enjoyed by some older dancers.

Square dancing is an activity open to people of almost every age group, but many people think of it as an activity for people in their late fifties or older; in this context even people in their thirties or forties may be considered "young" dancers. But among those involved with the full age range of current dancers, early twenties is usually the upper limit for designating a group or event with the term "youth".

==Clubs for youth dancers==
Youth square dancing, as a style, is typically open to all square dancers. The dancing is generally [[Modern Western square dance|modern western square dancing]], as it is practiced throughout the world, standardized by [[Callerlab]].

Square dance clubs vary in their accommodation of young dancers, ranging from clubs organized specifically for youth, through ones that are populated by dancers of every age, to some that are oriented exclusively to adults.

Some representative categories of square dance clubs and classes with respect to age:
*Those for children in a specific age range (e.g., 5-8, pre-teens, teens)
*Those for children and their parents or other family members
*Those that encourage dancers of all ages
*Those primarily oriented to adults but that allow children
*Those that do not allow children

==Distinctive features of youth square dancing==
There are a number of ways in which youth square dancing differs from typical adult square dancing.  These features are typical in clubs that are oriented specifically toward youth dancing, and also tend to be more common, even among adults, at mixed-age clubs and events where there are a significant number{{quantify|date=August 2008}} of youth dancers.

===Energy level===
Youth dancing tends to be "higher energy".  The dancing tends to be faster, with the caller using faster and more modern music.  (Youth square dancing shares this characteristic with gay square dancing.)

===Styling===
While all modern Western square dancing uses a common set of call definitions, which specify the basic dance movements and outcome of each call, there are many possible "frills" or "flourishes" -- extra movements that can be added without changing the resulting position.  These include extra twirls, kicks, and other movements of the hands or feet.  A few of these are traditional among adult dancers in certain geographic regions, but youth dancing generally includes more of them regardless of location.  (Youth square dancing shares this characteristic with gay square dancing.)

===Gender roles===
Gender is an essential aspect of square dance choreography.  Each square consists of four "boys" (or "gentlemen") and four "girls" (or "ladies"), who maintain this identity throughout a [[square dance tip|dance tip]]. The caller uses this to address calls to a subset of the dancers.  In addition, a relatively small number of calls, but ones that are commonly used, involve a different dance action for the boys and girls.  However, for this to work it is not necessary that the biological sex of the dancers match the roles that they are playing at any given time, e.g., it is possible for a woman to dance the "boy's part".

At the typical adult club, dancing the "opposite part" is relatively uncommon.  Many clubs are dominated by married couples, most of the dancers are not familiar with dancing the other part, and there may even be social stigma associated with such role reversals.  Sometimes it is accepted, but is seen only as a way to deal with special circumstances, such as to accommodate everybody when there are "extra" women.

In youth dancing, switching gender roles is perhaps a little more common as a variation. It might occur because a girl does not have a partner, usually due to a shortage of boys, but wants to dance. So she partners with another girl. It's very unusual for a boy to dance the girl's part. A girl might dance the boy's part one tip, and the girl's part the next.  Some youth dancers know how to dance both parts, having learned this either for the additional challenge or out of necessity to have more flexibility in squaring up with the available dancers. (Dancing opposite roles is characteristic in [[Challenge square dance|challenge-level square dancing]].)  Gay people also dance opposite roles, naturally.

===Partners===
At some adult square dance clubs (called couples clubs) and events, dancers may be expected to come with a partner, and dance mostly--in some cases exclusively-- with that partner. Although such clubs may are becoming increasingly rare as the square dance population ages and couples are split by death or divorce, they may still be found.  Other clubs allow both couples and singles as members; in these, it is common for couples to dance the first and last tip together, but take other partners throughout the dance.

In youth square dancing, it is very common for dancers to have a new partner for each tip, and in some cases this is accomplished by dancers simply joining squares as individuals with other dancers then coming along to be their partners, rather than by any sort of pre-arrangement.  Thus, at most clubs with a significant number of youth dancers, there is no requirement that dancers come with a partner and individual dancers are easily accommodated.  (Youth square dancing shares this characteristic with gay square dancing and challenge-level square dancing.)

===Learning style===
In general, younger people learn more quickly than older people, and so on average clubs with younger dancers teach a given dance program in a shorter period of time. Some groups teach youth the basics in short-format classes such as a one-week day camp or a one day "blast" class.  At some clubs, teens have been known to learn the calls by being "pulled through" sequences by their more experienced friends.

The stone-carved '''Zimbabwe Bird''' is the national emblem of [[Zimbabwe]], appearing on the national flags and coats of arms of both Zimbabwe and [[Rhodesia]], as well as on [[Rhodesian dollar|banknotes]] and coins (first on [[Coins of the Rhodesian pound|Rhodesian pound]] and then [[Coins of the Rhodesian dollar|Rhodesian dollar]]). It probably represents the [[Bateleur|bateleur eagle]] or the [[African fish eagle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Soapstone Birds from Great Zimbabwe |journal=African Arts|year=1985|volume=18|number=3|pages=68–73, 99–100|author=Thomas N. Huffman|jstor=3336358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review: The Soapstone Birds of Great Zimbabwe Symbols of a Nation by Edward Matenga |journal=The South African Archaeological Bulletin|year=2001|volume=56|number=173/174|pages=105–106|author=Paul Sinclair|jstor=3889033}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bird's design is derived from a number of [[soapstone]] sculptures found in the ruins of the ancient city of [[Great Zimbabwe]].

It is now the definitive icon of independent [[Zimbabwe]] with Matenga (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Soapstone Birds of Great Zimbabwe|journal=Studies in Global Archaeology|year=2001|volume=16|pages=1–261|author=Edward Matenga}}&lt;/ref&gt; listing over 100 organisations which now incorporate the Bird in their logo. 

==Origins==
The original carved birds are from the ruined city of Great Zimbabwe, which was built by ancestors of the [[Shona people|Shona]], starting in the 11th century and inhabited for over 300 years.&lt;ref name="metessay"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/zimb/hd_zimb.htm Great Zimbabwe (11th–15th century) | Thematic Essay | Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The ruins, after which modern Zimbabwe was named, cover some {{convert|730|ha|acre|abbr=off}} and are the largest ancient stone construction in sub-Saharan Africa. Among its notable elements are the [[soapstone]] bird sculptures, about {{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=off|0}} tall and standing on columns more than {{convert|90|cm|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall, which were originally installed on walls and monoliths within the city.&lt;ref name="metessay"/&gt; They are unique to Great Zimbabwe; nothing like them has been discovered elsewhere.&lt;ref name="HallStefoff2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Martin|last2=Stefoff|first2=Rebecca|title=Great Zimbabwe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xaVWJCHi7qcC&amp;pg=PA30|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-515773-4|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various explanations have been advanced to explain the symbolic meaning of the birds. One suggestion is that each bird was erected in turn to represent a new king, but this would have required improbably long reigns.&lt;ref name="MurrayBriggs2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Paul|last2=Briggs|first2=Philip|title=Zimbabwe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QqsDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203|year=2016|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-78477-016-7|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; More probably, the Zimbabwe birds represent sacred or totemic animals of the Shona – the bateleur eagle ([[Shona language|Shona]]: ''chapungu''), which was held to be a messenger from [[Mwari]] (God) and the ancestors, or the fish eagle (''hungwe'') which it has been suggested was the original totem of the Shona.&lt;ref name="Fontein2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fontein|first=Joost|title=The Silence of Great Zimbabwe: Contested Landscapes and the Power of Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ahJDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99|date= 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-315-41720-2|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial acquisition and return to Zimbabwe==
[[File:Soapstone birds on pedestals.jpg|right|thumb|Three of the Zimbabwe Birds, photographed around 1891]]
In 1889 a European hunter, Willi Posselt, travelled to Great Zimbabwe after hearing about it from another European explorer, Karl Mauch. He climbed to the highest point of the ruins despite being told that it was a sacred site where he should not trespass, and found the birds positioned in the centre of an enclosure around an apparent altar. He later wrote:

{{quote|Each one, including its plinth, had been hewn out of a solid block of stone and measured 4 feet 6 inches in height; and each was set firmly into the ground. There was also a stone shaped like a millstone and about 18 inches in diameter, with a number of figures carved in the border.

I selected the best specimen of the bird stones, the beaks of the remainder being damaged, and decided to dig it out. But while doing so, Andizibi [a local tribesman] and his followers became very excited and rushed around with their guns and [[assegai]]s. I fully expected them to attack us. However, I went on with my work but told Klass, who had loaded two rifles, to shoot the first man he saw aiming at either of us.&lt;ref name="Brown-Lowe2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown-Lowe|first=Robin|title=The Lost City of Solomon and Sheba: An African Mystery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=acU7AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT20|year=2003|publisher=History Press|isbn=978-0-7524-9490-6|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Posselt compensated Andizibi with a payment of blankets and "some other articles". As the bird on its pedestal was too heavy for him to carry, he hacked it off and hid the pedestal with the intention of returning later to retrieve it.&lt;ref name="Brown-Lowe2003" /&gt; He subsequently sold his bird to [[Cecil Rhodes]], who mounted it in the library of his [[Cape Town]] house, [[Groote Schuur]], and decorated the house's stairway with wooden replicas. Rhodes also had stone replicas made, three times the size of the original, to decorate the gates of his house in England near [[Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="Stocking1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuklick|first=Henrika|editor=Stocking, George W.|title=Colonial Situations: Essays on the Contextualization of Ethnographic Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBZ2euwwTGIC&amp;pg=PA137|year=1991|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-13123-4|page=135|chapter= Contested Monuments: The Politics of Archeology in Southern Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; A German missionary came to own the pedestal of one bird, which he sold to the Ethnological Museum in Berlin in 1907.&lt;ref name="bird"/&gt; 

Rhodes' acquisition of Posselt's bird prompted him to commission an investigation of the Great Zimbabwe ruins by [[James Theodore Bent]], which took place in 1891 following the [[British South Africa Company]]'s invasion of Mashonaland.&lt;ref name="Lhote1963"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lhote|first=Henri|title=Vanished Civilizations of the Ancient World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4IgkAQAAMAAJ|year=1963|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bent recorded that there were eight birds, six large and two small, and that there had probably originally been more as there were several additional stone pedestals of which the tops had been broken off.&lt;ref name="Bent1895"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bent|first=James Theodore|title=The Ruined Cities of Mashonaland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ct63nQEACAAJ|year=1895|publisher=Longmans &amp; Company|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colonists erroneously attributed Great Zimbabwe to ancient Mediterranean builders, believing native Africans to be incapable of constructing such a complex structure; thus in Rhodes' mind, as a 1932 guidebook put it, it was "a favourite symbol of the link between the order civilisation derived from the North or the East and the savage barbarism of Southern and Central Africa before the advent of the European."&lt;ref name="Maylam2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maylam|first=Paul|title=The Cult of Rhodes: Remembering an Imperialist in Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VbD_mokWhL8C&amp;pg=PT85|year=2005|publisher=New Africa Books|isbn=978-0-86486-684-4|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bent attributed the birds, wholly erroneously, to the [[Phoenicians]].&lt;ref&gt;Bent, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, a year after the attainment of independence in Zimbabwe, the South African government returned four of the sculptures to the country in exchange for a world-renowned collection of [[hymenoptera]] (bees, wasps and ants) housed in Harare; the fifth remains at Groote Schuur.&lt;ref name="MurrayBriggs2016" /&gt; In 2003, the German museum returned its portion of the bird's pedestal to Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="bird"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3028589.stm|title=Zimbabwe bird 'flies' home"|publisher=BBC News|date= 4 May 2003|accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The birds were displayed for a while in the [[Natural History Museum of Zimbabwe|Natural History Museum]] in [[Bulawayo]] and the Museum of Human Sciences in Harare,&lt;ref name="MunyaradziHenry2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munyaradzi|first1=Mawere,|last2=Henry|first2=Chiwaura,|title=African Museums in the Making: Reflections on the Politics of Material and Public Culture in Zimbabwe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stS6CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128|year=2015|publisher=Langaa RPCIG|isbn=978-9956-792-82-5|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are now housed in a small museum on the Great Zimbabwe site.&lt;ref name="MurrayBriggs2016" /&gt;

==On flags, currency and stamps==
The Zimbabwe bird has been a symbol of Zimbabwe and its predecessor states since 1924. The crest of Southern Rhodesia's coat of arms incorporated the Zimbabwe bird, and over time the bird became a widespread symbol of the colony. The paper money and coins of the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]], issued by the [[Bank of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] also displayed the bird, as did the post-federation flag of Rhodesia. The flag and state symbols of modern Zimbabwe continue to feature the Zimbabwe bird.&lt;ref&gt;Kuklick, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ǃGãǃne''' (!Gã!nge) is an [[List of extinct languages|extinct]] language of the [[Tuu languages|ǃKwi]] family, once spoken near [[Tsolo]] and in [[Umtata]] District in South Africa, south of Lesotho. The only material on the language is 140 words collected from two semi-speakers (rememberers) in 1931.&lt;ref name=Traill&gt;Anthony Traill, "The Khoisan Languages of South Africa", in Rajend Mesthrie, ed., 1995, ''Language and Social History: Studies in South African Sociolinguistics''&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[ǁXegwi language|ǁXegwi]], ǃGãǃne is considered an "outlier" among the !Kwi languages by Güldemann (2005, 2011).  ''[[Ethnologue]]'' and ''Glottolog'' count it as a dialect of [[Seroa language|Seroa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{e18|kqu|Seroa}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the two have no demonstrable connection apart from being in the !Kwi family.&lt;ref name="Traill" /&gt;
