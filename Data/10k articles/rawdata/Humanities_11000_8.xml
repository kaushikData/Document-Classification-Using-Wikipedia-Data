'''''A Journal to Stella''''' is a work by [[Jonathan Swift]] first partly published [[List of works published posthumously|posthumously]] in 1766.

It consists of 65 letters to his friend, [[Esther Johnson]], whom he called ''Stella'' and whom he may have secretly married. They were written between 1710 and 1713, from various locations in England, and though clearly intended for Stella's eyes were sometimes addressed to her companion Rebecca Dingley.

Amongst the references to contemporaries of Dean Swift, frequent mention is made of [[Elizabeth Germain]].&lt;ref name=DNB00&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Germain, Elizabeth|last=Courtney|first=William Prideaux|authorlink=William Prideaux Courtney|volume=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also mention of [[St. George Ashe]], [[Bishop of Clogher]], an old friend who by some accounts secretly married Swift to Stella in 1716.

In [[linguistics]], '''allocutive agreement''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''al'''}} or {{sc|'''alloc'''}}) refers to a [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] feature in which the gender of an [[addressee]] is marked overtly in an utterance using fully [[Grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] markers&lt;ref name=Trask&gt;[[Larry Trask|Trask, L.]] ''The History of Basque'' Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; even if the addressee is not referred to in the utterance&lt;ref name="antonov2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Antonov|first1=Anton|title=Verbal allocutivity in a crosslinguisticperspective|journal=Linguistic Typology|date=2015|volume=19|issue=1|url=https://www.academia.edu/1817520/Verbal_allocutivity_in_a_crosslinguistic_perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The term was first used by [[Louis Lucien Bonaparte]] in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Bonaparte, L.-L. ''Langue basque et langues finnoises'' (1862) London&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basque==
:''See also [[Basque verbs#Familiar forms and allocutive indices (hika)|Basque verbs: Familiar forms and allocutive indices (hika)]].''
In [[Basque language|Basque]], allocutive forms are required in the verb forms of a main clause when the speaker uses the familiar (also called "intimate") pronoun ''hi'' "thou" (as opposed to formal ''zu'' "you").&lt;ref name="Trask"/&gt; This is distinct from [[grammatical gender]] as it does not involve marking nouns for gender; it is also distinct from [[gender-specific pronoun]]s, such as [[English personal pronouns|English]] "he/she" or [[Gender differences in spoken Japanese|Japanese]] ''boku'' ("I", used by males) and ''atashi'' ("I", used by females). In Basque, allocutive agreement involves the grammatical marking of the gender of the addressee in the verb form itself.

Grammatically this is done by introducing an additional [[Grammatical person|second person]] marker in the verb form (marked &lt;small&gt;ALL&lt;/small&gt;):

:{| class=wikitable
|Amaia||n-a-iz
|-
|Amaia||&lt;small&gt;[[Absolutive case|ABS]].[[Grammatical person|1SG]]&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;[[Present tense|PRES]]&lt;/small&gt;-be
|-
|colspan=2|I am Amaia (speaking formally)
|}

versus

:{| class=wikitable
|Amaia||n-a-u-&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;'''n'''&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|Amaia||&lt;small&gt;[[Absolutive case|ABS]].[[Grammatical person|1SG]]&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;[[Present tense|PRES]]&lt;/small&gt;-have-&lt;small&gt;ALL.[[Grammatical gender|FEM]]&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|colspan=2|I am Amaia (to a female addressee, speaking informally)
|}

:{| class=wikitable
|Amaia||n-a-u-&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;'''k'''&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|Amaia||&lt;small&gt;[[Absolutive case|ABS]].[[Grammatical person|1SG]]&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;[[Present tense|PRES]]&lt;/small&gt;-have-&lt;small&gt;ALL.[[Grammatical gender|MASC]]&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|colspan=2|I am Amaia (to a male addressee, speaking informally)
|}

Eastern dialects have expanded on this by adding the polite (formerly plural) pronoun ''zu'' to the system; in some, [[hypocoristic]] palatalization converts this to ''-xu'':

{| class=wikitable
|-
! Level !! "I'll go" !! "you'll go"
|-
! Polite 
| ''joanen niz'' || ''joanen zira''
|-
! Intermed.
| ''joanen nuzu/nuxu'' || ''joanen xira''
|-
! Familiar, masc.
| ''joanen nuk'' || rowspan=2| ''joanen hiz''
|-
! Familiar, fem.
| ''joanen nun'' 
|}

Some varieties have done away with the unmarked forms except in subordinate clauses: ''joanen nuk / nun / nuzu'' vs. ''joanen nizela'' 'that I go'

==Beja==
[[Beja language|Beja]], a [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic language]], has allocutive forms, marking the gender of a masculine addressee with the clitic ''=a'' and with ''=i'' for feminine addressees, for example ''rihja=heːb=a'' "He saw me" (said to a man) vs. ''rihja=heːb=i'' "He saw me" (said to a woman)&lt;ref name="antonov2015" /&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1960">A '''book of office''' may refer either to a record of the conduct of affairs within an organization, particularly a religious organization like a church, or to a body of writing establishing the guiding philosophy of an organization like a political party.

== Practical Books of Office ==
[[Religious organizations]], including individual churches and parishes, may record the acts of their leaders in a book of office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dioceseofcheyenne.org/history/Pine_Bluffs_1913-1993_Thompson.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604034806/http://www.dioceseofcheyenne.org/history/Pine_Bluffs_1913-1993_Thompson.html |archivedate=2008-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has also been used to record the dealings of secular organizations like courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/historycourtcha00towngoog|title=History of the Court of Chancery in Nova Scotia|last=Charles James Townshend|date=1900|publisher=Carswell|others=unknown library|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The infrequency of reference to these books in modern use may point to a decline in their use.

== Philosophical Books of Office ==
A political party may refer to a work as a "book of office" if it represents the philosophical foundation of the party. [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[On Liberty]]'' is described as the book of office for the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] of the United Kingdom (and its predecessor the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]), and is presented to every newly elected President of the party upon election.

[[Image:Cempoala location map-fr.svg|thumb|300px|Cempoala Map]]
'''Cempoala''' or '''Zempoala''' ([[Nahuatl]] ''Cēmpoalātl'' 'Place of Twenty Waters') is an important [[Mesoamerican]] archaeological site located in the [[Úrsulo Galván]] Municipality, in the state of [[Veracruz]], Mexico.  The site was inhabited mainly by [[Totonac]]s, [[Chinanteca (people)|Chinanteca]]s and [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]].  It was one of the most important [[Totonac]] settlements during the postclassical Mesoamerican period&lt;ref name=Nombre1 /&gt; and the capital of the kingdom of [[Totonacapan]].  It is located one kilometer from the shore of the Actopan River and six kilometres from the coast.

According to some sources, the city was founded at least 1,500 years before the Spanish arrival, and there is evidence of [[Olmec]] influence. Although not much is known about the Preclassical and Classic Era, the Preclassical town was built on mounds to protect it from floods.  The Totonacs moved into the area during the [[Toltec Empire]] peak,  having been forced out of their settlements on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental. The Totonacs ruled the area of Totonacapan which consisted of the northern part of Veracruz together with the Zacatlán district of Puebla with a total population of approximately 250,000 and some 50 towns. At its peak, Cempoala had a population of between 25,000 and 30,000.&lt;ref name= Delange1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delange.org/Zempoala/Zempoala.htm|title=Visit to the Zempoala Archaeological Ruins|date=|publisher= Audre &amp; George DeLange|location=|accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The word "Cēmpoalli" (from Nahuatl root "Cēmpoal) means twenty and "ā (tl)", means water, hence "twenty waters".  An alternative etymology suggests the name meant “Abundant Water”.&lt;ref name="conservan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdtravel.net/turismo/arque/cemp.htm|title=Cempoala Archaeological Site|date=|publisher=cdtravel.net|location=|language=Spanish|accessdate=Sep 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029005202/http://cdtravel.net/turismo/arque/cemp.htm#|archive-date=2010-10-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both versions imply that the city had many aqueducts which fed the numerous gardens and surrounding farmland fields.  A third version conjectures that the name referred to commercial activities which, according to some sources, were performed every 20 days in pre-Hispanic times.&lt;ref name=Nombre1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.veracruz.gob.mx/portal/page?_pageid=313,4309395&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|title=Cempoala Archaeological Site|date=|publisher=Veracruz Portal|location=Veracruz|language=Spanish|accessdate=Sep 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627063359/http://portal.veracruz.gob.mx/portal/page?_pageid=313%2C4309395&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|archivedate=2009-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==History==
Research by Vincent H. Malmström (Dartmouth College) describes an interesting astronomical relationship between the three round rings found at Cempoala.&lt;ref name=Delange1 /&gt;

The Totonacs moved onto this coastal plain during the height of the Toltec Empire (A.D. 1000-1150). Archaeologists believe the Toltecs had pushed the Totonacs out of their settlements on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental and down to the coast.&lt;ref name=Delange1 /&gt;

Cempoala lies on the flat coastal plain about six kilometers from the Gulf and a little more than a kilometer from the banks of the Rio Actopan (also called the Rio Chachalacas).&lt;ref name=Delange1 /&gt;

==Alliance==
Cempoala and other coastal Veracruz locations were defeated by the Aztec armies of [[Moctezuma I]] (mid-15th century). They were heavily taxed (goods and sacrifice prisoners) and forced them to send hundreds of people as a tribute for sacrifices and as slaves. This condition treatment at the hands of the Aztecs created the situation which led up to the defeat of the Aztecs by Cortez in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=Delange1 /&gt;

When the Spaniards lead by [[Hernán Cortés|Hernan Cortes]] arrived in 1519, the Totonacs had been suffering Aztec domination for several years.

The Spaniards heard of a town on the way named Zempoala while at their malaria-ridden camp of San Juan de Ulua. They marched over and sent word of their arrival, and upon their arrival were met by 20 Zempoalan dignitaries.

In town, they met with "Fat Chief" Xicomecoatl, who fed them and gave them quarters. The Totonac presented Cortez with numerous gifts, including gold jewelry.

Xicomecoatl made many complaints against the Aztec Empire and the great Montezuma.&lt;ref name=Delange1 /&gt;

Cortez promised alleviate his concerns. At Quiahuiztlan, the Spaniards and Totonacs forged their alliance against the Aztecs.&lt;ref name=Delange1 /&gt;

Spaniards and Totonacs had the same fate. In August 1519, Cortés and 40 Totonac captains, which by a lower estimate equates to around 8000 soldiers, and 400 porters left for Tenochtitlan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Conquistadors: Indigenous Allies in the Conquest of Mesoamerica|last=Oudijk|first=Michel R.|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0806143255|location=Norman|pages=32|chapter=Mesoamerican Conquistadors in the Sixteenth Century|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The effort ended with the fall of Tenochtitlan and Moctezuma II, the Aztec Tlatoani, as hostage.&lt;ref name=Delange1 /&gt;

==Site==
The site buildings show impressive squares and fortresses’ surrounded by vegetation which permanently covers this area, called "Place of accounts", as was called the Mexica rulers, because it was here where all taxes and tributes from the region were collected.&lt;ref name=Nombre1 /&gt;

What today is the archaeological site had been the most important political-religious center of the city, whose constructions were made with river stones, jointed with mortar and flattened with the lime produced from burning shells and snails, obtaining in this way that buildings shone from far away as if they were built in silver.&lt;ref name=Nombre1 /&gt;

The urban Cempoala complex includes several buildings and major architectural structures, not only by its construction, but by its historic importance, often unknown, as for example, in the part of the site now known as walled system IV, Cortés successfully faced the forces of Pánfilo de Narváez, thus consolidating his leadership in the colonization of the Mexican territory.&lt;ref name=Nombre1 /&gt;

==Structures==
The main structures at Cempoala, include the following:

*Templo del Sol or Great Pyramid
Or Sun Temple built on the same platform as the Templo Mayor, separated by an ample square. This is probably the most impressive structure on site.&lt;ref name=Nombre1 /&gt; The great temple resembles the Sun Temple in Tenochtitlan. The Quetzalcoatl Temple, the Feathered Serpent God is a square platform, and the Ehécatl Temple, the wind God is round.&lt;ref name=Nombre1 /&gt;

* Templo Mayor
The top part is surrounded by battlements.&lt;ref name=Nombre1 /&gt;

* Templo de las Chimeneas
Or chimney temple, has a series of semicircular pillars 1.5 meters high, because of this peculiar shape, the building is named.&lt;ref name=Nombre1 /&gt;

* El Pimiento
It has a three bodied structure, its most notable feature is its exterior decor based on skulls representations.&lt;ref name=Nombre1 /&gt;

* Moctezuma's Palace
No information

* Templo de la Cruz
Or cross temple, maintains some fresco mural sections with celestial motifs.&lt;ref name=Nombre1 /&gt;

* Templo Las Caritas
The so-called Temple of Charity standing about 200 meters to the east is a two-tier structure decorated with fragments of stucco reliefs. It is named for the hundreds of stucco skulls that once adorned the facade of a small structure at the base of the temple's staircase-archaeologists believe this complex was dedicated to the god of death.&lt;ref name=Delange1 /&gt;

It consists of two overlaid basements with top side elements, an open room, two decorative belts, the lower has murals depicting the sun, Moon and Venus, as early morning star, the higher section has a large amount of clay “little faces” or little skulls. The Structure is decorated with stucco faces on the walls and hieroglyphs painted in lower sections Gran Pirámide and the wind god Ehécatl worship altar.&lt;ref name=Nombre1 /&gt;
  
* Other Mounds
There are other mounds, unexcavated, that cannot be visited, located within Cempoala current houses. Some of the structures there are probably built in the same style as were the residences of the prehispanic commoners.&lt;ref name=Delange1 /&gt;

==Astronomy in Cempoala==
Some research by Vincent H. Malmström of Dartmouth College describes an interesting astronomical relationship that exists because of the three round rings found at Zempoala. We will quote a part of his discussion concerning the Three Ceremonial Rings of Zempoala.&lt;ref name=Delange1 /&gt;

Beneath the massive pyramid (north eastern corner) in the central plaza of Zempoala, are three puzzling stone rings, each made from rounded beach cobbles jointed together to make small, stepped pillars. The largest rings has 40 stepped pillars, the middle ring has 28, and the smaller ring 13, around its circumference. It seems that three rings were used to calibrate different astronomical cycles, possibly by placing a marker or an idol from one pillar to the next, day after day.&lt;ref name=Delange1 /&gt;

The stone rings viewed from the top of the main pyramid, are surmounted by 13, 28, and 40 step like pillars, might have been counting devices to keep track of eclipse cycles, by Totonac priests.&lt;ref name=Delange1 /&gt;

It is possible that by using the rings, Totonacs priests were able to calibrate movements of the moon. There are reasons to believe these rings provide further evidence of the intellectual curiosity and architectural ingenuity of the early Mesoamericans."&lt;ref name=Delange1 /&gt;

==History after 1519==
Cempoala was a prosperous city in 1519, in which the Spaniards under [[Hernan Cortes]] arrived in Mexico and established alliances with some groups to go towards the capture of Tenochtitlan, the city of Cempoala then numbered approximately 20,000 inhabitants and was the most important ceremonial and commercial center of the Aztec empire, more so than Tlatelolco, the Spaniards called it in Villa Viciosa, meaning fertile village by the many festivals and vast orchards and gardens available and festive and joyful inhabitants character, was later known as new Seville for its resemblance, as per the spaniards, with the Iberian town.&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|107-108}} 

Between 1575 and 1577 a smallpox (matlazahuatl) epidemic decimated the population, it is estimated that two million people lost their lives in Mesoamerica, the city was totally abandoned, and the few survivors moved to the city of Xalapa, eventually fell into oblivion, until archeologist Francisco del Paso and Troncoso rediscovered it.

After the victory and conquest, the Cempoala Totonacs soon took their new destiny next to their foreign partners: were re-located and had to leave the city as  they were Christianized, banned from practicing their ancient cults and were turned into slaves to work new Spanish sugar cane fields.

Cortés first arrived at Zempoala in 1519 with 500 conquistadores who then made a long trip up into the highlands using the same routes used to haul maize to Tenochtitlan. His was added by the lord of Cempoala, known by his extraordinary corpulence as the "fat Cacique".&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|207}} The town was settled around walled perimeters delimiting temples and palaces; dating back to the 11th to 16th centuries.&lt;ref name=Nombre1 /&gt;

Circumlocution is often used by people with [[aphasia]] and people learning a new language, where simple terms can be paraphrased to aid learning or communication (for example, paraphrasing the word "grandfather" as "the father of one's father"). [[Euphemism]], [[innuendo]] and [[equivocation]] are different forms of circumlocution.

==Euphemism==
{{Main|Euphemism}}
''Euphemistic language'' often uses circumlocution to avoid saying words that are [[taboo]] or considered offensive. For example, "'''Holy mother of [[Jesus]]'''!" is a circumlocution of "[[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]!", but "heck", while still euphemistic, is not a circumlocution of "[[hell]]".

Euphemistic circumlocution is also used to avoid saying "unlucky words"&amp;mdash;words which are taboo for reasons connected with [[superstition]]: for example, calling the [[devil]] "Old Nick",&lt;ref group="note"&gt;"Speak of the devil, and he will appear" is the proverb.&lt;/ref&gt; calling [[Macbeth]] "[[the Scottish Play]]" or saying "[[baker's dozen]]" instead of [[triskaidekaphobia|thirteen]].

==Innuendo==
{{Main|Innuendo}}
''Innuendo'' refers to something suggested but not explicitly stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/innuendo |title=innuendo – definition of innuendo by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equivocation==
{{main|Equivocation}}
''Equivocation'' is the use of ambiguous language to avoid telling the truth or forming commitments.&lt;ref&gt;New Oxford American Dictionary 2nd edition 2005 by Oxford University Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[coat of arms]] of the [[Dominican Republic]]''' features a shield in similarly quartered colors as the flag, supported by a [[bay laurel]] branch (left) and a [[Palm tree|palm]] frond (right); above the shield, a blue ribbon displays the national [[motto]]: ''Dios, Patria, Libertad'' (God, Homeland, Liberty). Below the shield, the words ''República Dominicana'' appear on a red ribbon. In the center of the shield, flanked by six spears (three on each side), the front four holding the national flag, is a [[Catholic Bible]] with a small golden [[Latin cross|cross]] above it

The constitution dictates that the Bible be opened to the book of [[the New Testament]], [[John 8]]:32, which reads "conocerán la verdad, y la verdad los hará libres", literal translation: '''"know the truth and the truth will set you free"'''.

The coat of arms appears in the center of the [[flag of the Dominican Republic]].

The '''College of Language and Culture Studies''' is part of the [[Royal University of Bhutan]].  CLCS is located at Taktse, Trongsa, central Bhutan. It was founded in 1961 as a semi-monastic school at Wangditse and later moved to Semtoka Dzong in Thimphu. It has now become a fully fledged degree awarding institution specializing in education and research in Bhutanese language and culture. It also takes in international students for relevant courses as part of the study abroad programme. It offers courses both at the undergrad as well as at the masters level. The institute offers programmes on Bhutanese Language and Literature (Bilingual), Bhutanese and Himalayan Studies, Language and Culture, Language and Communication Skills.  

It has over a thousand students and more than sixty faculty members. The primary task of the college is to preserve and promote [[Dzongkha]], the national language of Bhutan.

'''Edwin Lieuwen''' (February 8, 1923 – May 25, 1988) was an [[United States|American]] historian, professor, and author. His area of expertise was focused on [[Latin America]]. His work was a major precursor to the establishing of the [[Latin American Institute]].&lt;ref name=jsotr&gt;{{cite web | jstor=2516166| title=Edwin Lieuwen (1923-1988)  | work=The Hispanic American Historical Review | date=Feb 1989 | author=Meyer, Michael C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=uni/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born in Harrison, [[South Dakota]] on February 8, 1923, he attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and graduated in 1951 with a PhD. He then received a [[Fulbright]] lectureship to attend the [[University of Utrecht]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=jsotr/&gt;

==Career==
After his return from the Netherlands, he worked for three years as a policy analyst at the [[United States State Department]] for three years. In 1957 he was appointed as chairman to the history department as the [[University of New Mexico]]. Lieuwen found himself in an academic circle that included [[France Vinton Scholes]] as the authority on Latin American studies. His work established the Latin American studies program which would later become the Latin American Institute.&lt;ref name=jsotr/&gt;

He wrote for the [[Kirkus Reviews]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/edwin-lieuwen/arms-and-politics-in-latin-america/ | title=ARMS AND POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA | work=Kirkus Review | date=Jan 29, 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/edwin-lieuwen-2/us-policy-in-latin-america/ | title=U.S. POLICY IN LATIN AMERICA | work=Kirkus Review | accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/edwin-lieuwen/enerals-and-presidents/ | title=ENERALS AND PRESIDENTS | work=Kirkus Review | accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Journal of Economic History]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/cupjechis/v_3a15_3ay_3a1955_3ai_3a02_3ap_3a175-177_5f05.htm | title=Petroleum in Venezuela: A History.

Afterwards, their bodies were then dynamited, on August 20, 1976.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite news |title=Argentine police get life term in 'dirty war' case |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=July 11, 2008 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN11412259 |accessdate=2009-09-19 |first=Hilary |last=Burke}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Ferguson |title=The Fatima Massacre |date=July 30, 2008 |url=http://www.truthout.org/article/the-fatima-massacre |publisher=''[[Truthout.org|truthout]]'' |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==

Shortly after four o'clock on the morning of August 20, a loud explosion woke inhabitants of Fatima. Workers at a nearby brick foundry arrived on scene and claimed they had found human remains scattered over an area of one hundred yards, presumably a result of the explosion. Almost immediately the area was fenced by soldiers. Photojournalists who had taken photos were kidnapped. The soldiers and civilian staff collected the body parts and loaded them onto a truck of the Municipality of [[Pilar, Buenos Aires|Pilar]].{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole paragraph; these are specific claims and the source doesn't provide any of these details|date=November 2015}}

According to the police, the victims were thirty people, ten women and twenty men, including some teenagers. Only five could be identified at the time. The bodies of the unidentified victims were buried in Derqui Pte Cemetery, where they were exhumed years later for identification.

The Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team was able to identify eleven more victims. One of the first was Susana Pedrini of [[Bronzel]], after whom they named a street in the center of Pilar, specifically in the square near the water tank.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for this; neither quoted source mentions this|date=November 2015}}.

Half of the victims could be identified by family and friends through the work of the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team.

On July 11, 2008, two former Argentine police officers were sentenced to life in prison for their role in the killings.&lt;ref name=reuters /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amnesty International Report 2009 - Argentina |publisher=[[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,ARG,4562d94e2,4a1fae02c,0.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009082709/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,ARG,4562d94e2,4a1fae02c,0.html |archivedate=2012-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9172">'''Foreclosure''' (also known as "foreclusion"; {{lang-fr|forclusion}}) is the English translation of a term that the French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] introduced into [[psychoanalysis]] to identify a specific psychical cause for [[psychosis]]. &lt;ref&gt;Dylan Evans, ''Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis'' (Routledge 1996) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to Élisabeth Roudinesco, the term was originally introduced into [[psychology]] 'in 1928, when [[Édouard Pichon]] published, in [[Pierre Janet]]'s review, his article on "The Psychological Significance of Negation in French": "...[and] borrowed the legal term ''forclusif'' to indicate facts that the speaker no longer sees as part of reality'.&lt;ref&gt;Roudinesco, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Christophe Laudou, the term was introduced by Damourette and Pichon.&lt;ref&gt;« À propos de Judith Butler. », Mouvements 6/2004 (no 36), p. 158-164, URL : www.cairn.info/revue-mouvements-2004-6-page-158.htm. DOI : 10.3917/mouv.036.0158.&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Freud vs Laforgue===
The publication took part against the background of the Twenties dispute between Freud and [[René Laforgue]] over [[scotomization]]. 'If I am not mistaken', Freud wrote in 1927, 'Laforgue would say in this case that the boy "scotomizes" his perception of the woman's lack of a penis. A new technical term is justified when it describes a new fact or emphasizes it. This is not the case here'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "Fetishism", ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; Freud went on to suggest that if one wanted to 'reserve the word "''[[Psychological repression|Verdrängung]]''" ["repression"] for the affect, then the correct German word for the vicissitude of the idea would be "''[[Disavowal|Verleugnung]]''" ["disavowal"]'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Fetishism", pp. 352–3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacan's introduction of foreclosure==

In 1938 Lacan relates the origin of psychosis to an exclusion of the father from the family structure thereby reducing this structure to a mother-child relationship. &lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, "Les complexes familiaux dans la formation de l'individu", Paris, Navarin 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, when working on the distinctions between the real, imaginary and symbolic father, he specifies that it is the absence of the symbolic father which is linked to psychosis.

Lacan uses the Freudian term, "''Verwerfung''", which the ''Standard Edition'' translates as "repudiation", as a specific defence mechanism different from repression, "''Verdrängung''", in which "the ego rejects the incompatible idea together with its affect and behaves as if the idea has never occurred to the ego at all."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "the Neuro-Psychoses of Defence", ''SE III''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954 basing himself on a reading of the "Wolf Man"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "From the History of an Infantile Neurosis", ''SE XVII''&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan identifies ''Verwerfung'' as the specific mechanism of psychosis where an element is rejected outside the symbolic order as if it has never existed.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'', "Reply to Jean Hyppolite's commentary on Freud's ''Negation''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 in his Seminar on Psychoses he translates ''Verwerfung'' as ''forclusion'', that is foreclosure.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''The Seminar. Book III. The Psychoses, 1955-56'', trans. Russell Grigg, New York, Norton, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  "Let us extract from several of Freud's texts a term that is sufficiently articulated in them to designate in them a function of the unconscious that is distinct from the repressed. Let us take as demonstrated the essence of my Seminar on the Psychoses, namely, that this term refers to psychosis: this term is ''Verwerfung'' (foreclosure)".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacan and psychosis==

The problematic Lacan sought to address with the twin tools of foreclosure and the signifier was that of the difference between psychosis and neurosis, as manifested in and indicated by language usage. It was common analytic ground that "when psychotics speak they always have some meanings that are too fixed, and some that are far too loose, they have a different relation to language, and a different way of speaking from neurotics."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Hill, ''Lacan for Beginners'' (London 1997) pp. 113 and 122&lt;/ref&gt; Freud, following [[Eugen Bleuler|Bleuler]] and [[Carl Jung|Jung]] had pointed to 'a number of changes in ''speech''...in schizophrenics...''words'' are subjected to the same process as that which makes the dream'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) pp. 202–4&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan used foreclosure to explain why.

When Lacan first uses the Freudian concept of ''Verwerfung'' (repudiation) in his search for a specific mechanism for psychosis, it is not clear what is repudiated (castration, speech). It is in 1957 in his article "On a question preliminary to any possible treatment of psychosis"&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' New York Norton, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; that he advances the notion that it is the [[Name-of-the-Father]] (a fundamental signifier) that is the object of foreclosure. In this way Lacan combines two of his main themes on the causality of psychosis: the absence of the father and the concept of ''Verwerfung''. This ideas remains central to Lacan's thinking on psychosis throughout the rest of his work.

Lacan considered the father to play a vital role in breaking the initial mother/child duality and introducing the child to the wider world of culture, language, institutions and social reality — the [[The Symbolic|Symbolic]] world — the father being "the human being who stands for the law and order that the mother plants in the life of the child...widens the child's view of the world."&lt;ref&gt;[[D. W. Winnicott]], ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Penguin 1973) pp. 115–6&lt;/ref&gt; The result in normal development is "proper separation from the mother, as marked out by the Names-of-the-father."&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Lacan postulates the existence of a paternal function (the "[[Name of the Father]]" or "primordial signifier") which allows the realm of [[the Symbolic]] to be bound to the realms of [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the Imaginary]] and [[the Real]]. This function prevents the developing child from being engulfed by its mother and allows him/her to emerge as a separate entity in his/her own right. It is a symbol of parental authority (a general symbol that represents the power of father of the [[Oedipus complex]]) that brings the child into the realm of the Symbolic by forcing him/her to act and to verbalise as an adult. As a result, the three realms are integrated in a way that is conducive to the creation of meaning and successful communication by means of what Lacan calls a [[Borromean knot]].

When the Name-of-the-Father is foreclosed for a particular subject, it leaves a hole in the Symbolic order which can never be filled. The subject can then be said to have a psychotic structure, even if he shows none of the classical signs of psychosis. When the foreclosed Name-of-the-Father re-appears in the Real, the subject is unable to assimilate it and the result of this collision between the subject and the inassimilable signifier of the Name-of-the-father is the entry into psychosis proper characterized by the onset of hallucinations and/or delusions.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Seminar III, ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, when the paternal function is "foreclosed" from the Symbolic order, the realm of the Symbolic is insufficiently bound to the realm of the Imaginary and failures in meaning may occur (the Borromean knot becomes undone and the three realms completely disconnected), with "a disorder caused at the most personal juncture between the subject and his sense of being alive."&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits, ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; Psychosis is experienced after some environmental sign in the form of a [[signifier]] which the individual cannot assimilate is triggered, and this entails that "the Name-of-the-Father, is foreclosed, ''verworfen'', is called into symbolic opposition to the subject."&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits, ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; The fabric of the individual's reality is ripped apart and no meaningful Symbolic sense can be made of experience. "Absence of transcendence of the Oedipus places the subject under the regime of foreclosure or non-distinction between the symbolic and the real';&lt;ref&gt;Anika Lemaire, ''Jacques Lacan'' (1979) p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; and psychotic [[delusions]] or [[hallucinations]] are the consequent result of the individual's striving to account for what he/she experiences.

In [[linguistics]], '''formal semantics''' seeks to understand [[Meaning (linguistics)|linguistic meaning]] by constructing precise mathematical models of the principles that speakers use to define relations between expressions in a [[natural language]] and the world that supports meaningful discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Aronoff|author2=Janie Rees-Miller|title=The handbook of linguistics|year=2003|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-0252-0}}, chapter 15: An Introduction to Formal semantics.&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematical tools used are the confluence of [[formal logic]] and [[formal language theory]], especially [[typed lambda calculi]].

==Overview==
Linguists rarely employed formal semantics until [[Richard Montague]] showed how English (or any natural language) could be treated like a formal language.&lt;ref&gt;For a very readable and succinct overview of how formal semantics found its way into linguistics, please refer to ''[https://www.msu.edu/~abbottb/formal.htm The formal approach to meaning: Formal semantics and its recent developments]'' by [[Barbara Abbott]]. In: Journal of Foreign Languages (Shanghai), 119:1 (January 1999), 2–20.&lt;/ref&gt; His contribution to linguistic semantics, which is now known as [[Montague grammar]], was the basis for further developments, like the [[categorial grammar]] of [[Bar-Hillel]] and colleagues, and the more recent [[type-logical semantics]] (or grammar) based on [[Lambek calculus]].&lt;ref name="Moortgat1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Moortgat|title=Categorial investigations: logical and linguistic aspects of the Lambek calculus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CdFE9X_FCoC|accessdate=5 April 2011|year=1988|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-90-6765-387-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another line of inquiry, using [[linear logic]], is [[Glue semantics]], which is based on the idea of "interpretation as deduction", closely related to the "parsing as deduction" paradigm of categorial grammar.&lt;ref name="Bunt2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harry Bunt|title=Computing Meaning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nyFa5ngYThMC&amp;pg=PA458|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-5957-5|page=458|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cognitive semantics]] emerged and developed as a reaction against formal semantics, but there have been recently several attempts at reconciling both positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamm|first=Fritz|last2=Kamp|first2=Hans|last3=Lambalgen|first3=Michiel van|date=2006-09-01|title=There is no opposition between Formal and Cognitive Semantics|url=https://doi.org/10.1515/TL.2006.001|journal=Theoretical Linguistics|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=1–40|doi=10.1515/tl.2006.001|issn=1613-4060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geometric abstraction''' is a form of [[abstract art]] based on the use of geometric forms sometimes, though not always, placed in [[Perspective (visual)|non-illusionistic]] space and combined into non-objective (non-representational) compositions. Although the genre was popularized by [[avant-garde]] artists in the early twentieth century, similar motifs have been used in art since ancient times.

==History==
Geometric abstraction is present among many cultures throughout history both as decorative motifs and as art pieces themselves. [[Islamic art]], in its prohibition of depicting religious figures, is a prime example of this geometric pattern-based art, which existed centuries before the movement in Europe and in many ways influenced this Western school. Aligned with and often used in the architecture of Islamic civilations spanning the 7th century-20th century, geometric patterns were used to visually connect spirituality with science and art, both of which were key to Islamic thought of the time.

Throughout 20th-century art historical discourse, critics and artists working within the [[reductionism|reductive]] or pure strains of abstraction have often suggested that geometric abstraction represents the height of a non-objective art practice, which necessarily stresses or calls attention to the root plasticity and two-dimensionality of painting as an artistic medium. Thus, it has been suggested that geometric abstraction might function as a solution to problems concerning the need for modernist painting to reject the illusionistic practices of the past while addressing the inherently two dimensional nature of the picture plane as well as the canvas functioning as its support. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], one of the forerunners of pure non-objective painting, was among the first modern artists to explore this geometric approach in his abstract work. Other examples of pioneer abstractionists such as [[Kasimir Malevich]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] have also embraced this approach towards abstract painting. Mondrian's painting "Composition No. 10" (1939–1942) clearly defines his radical but classical approach to the construction of horizontal and vertical lines, as Mondrian wrote, "constructed with awareness, but not with calculation, led by high intuition, and brought to harmony and rhythm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mondrian's Philosophy of Visual Rhythm|last=Tosaki|first=Eiichi|publisher=Springer|year=2017|isbn=9402411984|location=|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as there are both two-dimensional and three-dimensional geometries, the abstract sculpture of the 20th century was of course no less affected than painting by geometricizing tendencies. [[Georges Vantongerloo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=6091|title=The Collection: Georges Vantongerloo|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Bill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/14/obituaries/max-bill-85-painter-sculptor-and-architect-in-austere-style.html|author=Smith, Roberta|date=December 14, 1994|title=Max Bill, 85, Painter, Sculptor And Architect in Austere Style|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, are perhaps best known for their geometric sculpture, although both of them were also painters; and indeed, the ideals of geometric abstraction find nearly perfect expression in their titling (e.g., Vantongerloo's "Construction in the Sphere") and pronouncements (e.g., Bill's statement that "I am of the opinion that it is possible to develop an art largely on the basis of mathematical thinking.") Expressionist abstract painting, as practiced by artists such as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Clyfford Still]], and [[Wols]], represents the opposite of geometric abstraction.

==Relationship with music==

Abstract art has also historically been likened to [[music]] in its ability to convey emotional or expressive feelings and ideas without reliance upon or reference to recognizable objective forms already existent in reality. [[Wassily Kandinsky]] has discussed this connection between music and painting, as well as how the practice of classical composition had influenced his work, at length in his seminal essay ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1808">'''Gertrud Pätsch''' (born 22 January 1910 in [[Hannover]] as ''Gertrud Kettler''; † 14 December 1994 in [[Jena]]) was a German [[ethnologist]] and [[philologist]], who rendered service in the area of [[Kartvelian studies]].

In 1937 she graduated in Munster with a degree in the [[Old Georgian language]]. After the Second World War she left the western sector of Germany for East Berlin, where she earned a ''[[habilitation]]'' at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] in [[Indonesian linguistics]]. She taught in Berlin until she moved to the [[Friedrich Schiller University]] in Jena in 1960, where she foundet the kartvelologian fakulty. After her retirement she worked for two years at the [[Tbilisi State University]] in Georgia. She published books and many articles in journals, such as [[Bedi Kartlisa|Bedi Kartlisa. Revue de Kartvélologie]]. Towards the end of her life Pätsch translated many pieces of Georgian literature, such as  [[Shota Rustaveli]]`s poem "[[The Knight in the Panther's Skin]]." She worked diligently for cultural exchanges between the [[German Democratic Republic]] and Georgia. She even had the [[Georgian scripts|Georgian alphabet]] engraved in the stairwell of her home in Jena, where she also had built a guest house for such visitors as [[Konstantine Gamsakhurdia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13712">The '''Getty Conservation Institute''' (GCI), located in [[Los Angeles, California]], is a program of the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]]. It is headquartered at the [[Getty Center]] but also has facilities at the [[Getty Villa]], and commenced operation in 1985.&lt;ref name=GCI&gt;J. Paul Getty Trust. [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/institute/ About the Conservation Institute.] Retrieved May 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The GCI is a private international research institution dedicated to advancing conservation practice through the creation and delivery of knowledge. It "serves the conservation community through scientific research, education and training, model field projects, and the dissemination of the results of both its own work and the work of others in the field" and "adheres to the principles that guide the work of the Getty Trust: service, philanthropy, teaching, and access."&lt;ref name=GCI/&gt; GCI has activities in both [[art conservation]] and [[architectural conservation]].&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;Adams, Eric. The Getty's conservation mission. ''Architecture'', December 1997, vol. 86, issue 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

GCI conducts scientific research related to art conservation. It offers formal education and training programs, and it has published a number of scholarly books.  GCI has supported field projects around the world to preserve cultural heritage.

== Scientific projects ==
GCI scientists study the deterioration of objects and buildings, and how to prevent or stop such deterioration.&lt;ref name=GCIScience&gt;Getty Conservation Institute. [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/science/about/ About GCI Science.] Retrieved August 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of many projects in this area involved the effect of outdoor and indoor air pollutants on museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;Getty Conservation Institute. [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/science/pollutants/index.html Pollutants in the museum environment (1985-1998).] Retrieved August 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another project analyzed the cause of deterioration of the [[sandstone]] in the original National Capitol Columns now at the [[United States National Arboretum]].&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt;

In addition, GCI "conducts scientific research on materials' composition."&lt;ref name=GCIScience/&gt; For example, a project on the conservation of photographs has as one of its objectives the creation of an "Atlas of Analytical Signatures of [[List of photographic processes|Photographic Processes]]" which will provide "a precise chemical fingerprint of all the 150 or so ways pictures have been developed."&lt;ref&gt;Getty Conservation Institute. [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/science/photocon/ Research on the conservation of photographs.] October 2006. Retrieved November 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Randy. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/01/arts/design/01kenn.html Arsenic and old photos.] ''New York Times'', April 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of that project, Getty scientists once examined the world's first photograph from nature by [[Nicéphore Niépce]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyden, Jacki, and Dusan Stulik.

Scientists at GCI viewed the CheMin instrument aboard the [[Curiosity rover]], currently exploring the [[Gale crater]] on [[Mars]], as a potentially valuable means to examine ancient works of art without damaging them. Until recently, only a few instruments were available to determine the composition without cutting out physical samples large enough to potentially damage the artifacts. The CheMin on ''Curiosity'' directs a beam of [[X-rays]] at particles as small as 400&amp;nbsp;µm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=inXitu Press Release |url=http://www.inxitu.com/new/pdf/NASA%20invention%20of%20the%20year%20award%20v2.pdf |date=March 10, 2011 |accessdate=August 13, 2012 |publisher=[[InXitu]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803081352/http://www.inxitu.com/new/pdf/NASA%20invention%20of%20the%20year%20award%20v2.pdf |archivedate=August 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and reads the [[radiation]] [[scattering|scattered]] back to determine the composition of an object in minutes.

== Education and training ==
Training of interested parties around the world is important for the sustainability of GCI's work.&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt; For example, GCI collaborated with other organizations to create a course "to assist museum personnel in safeguarding their collections from the effects of natural and human-made emergencies."&lt;ref&gt;Getty Conservation Institute. [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/education/teamwork/ Teamwork for Integrated Emergency Management.] Retrieved August 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, GCI developed a course on the "Fundamentals of the Conservation of Photographs" which is now taught in eastern Europe by the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Bratislava and the Slovak National Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/education/about/|title=About GCI Education|publisher=Getty Trust|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides courses and workshops, GCI has also been involved with long-term education programs, such as establishing a [[Master's degree]] program in Archaeological and Ethnographic Conservation in collaboration with the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;A.M.H.S. New conservation program. ''Archaeology'', May/June 1999, vol. 52, issue 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cotsen Institute of Archaeology. [http://www.ioa.ucla.edu/conservation/ The UCLA/Getty Conservation Program.] Retrieved August 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Field projects ==
GCI's field projects are "selected based on how they fit the institute's goals of raising public awareness, contributing new, broadly applicable information to the field, and supporting cultural heritage" and "must be executed in collaboration with partners… who must be serious about their efforts… so that projects are assured of continuing after the Getty's involvement ceases."&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt; Among other completed GCI field projects were efforts to preserve the [[Mogao Caves]] and [[Yungang Grottoes]] in China (announced in 1989);&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, David S.

"High" is usually considered a reference to a social class [[Colorism|system in which skin color]] (and associated ancestries) is a major factor, placing those of lighter skin (with more European ancestry) at the top and those of darker skin at the bottom.&lt;ref name="hunt"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Hunt | first1 = Y. | last2 = Augustson | first2 = E. | last3 = Rutten | first3 = L. | last4 = Moser | first4 = R. | last5 = Yaroch | first5 = A. | doi = 10.1007/978-94-007-2048-0_2 | chapter = History and Culture of Tanning in the United States | title = Shedding Light on Indoor Tanning | pages = 5 | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-94-007-2047-3 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  High yellows, while still considered part of the African-American ethnic group, were thought to gain [[White privilege|privileges]] because of their skin and ancestry.&lt;ref name="banks2000"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reading of the etymology of the word "high" is that it is a slang word for "very", often used in Southern English, therefore "very yellow" (as opposed to brown).

== Use as social class distinction ==
In an aspect of [[colorism]], "high yellow" was also related to [[social class]] distinctions among people of color. In post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[South Carolina]], according to one account by historian [[Edward Ball (American author)|Edward Ball]], "Members of the colored elite were called 'high yellow' for their shade of skin", as well as slang terms meaning [[snob]]bish.&lt;ref name="Ball2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Edward|title=The Sweet Hell Inside: The Rise of an Elite Black Family in the Segregated South|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m39Aw5AGm4oC&amp;pg=PA269|accessdate=6 June 2013|date=5 November 2002|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-050590-5|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Orleans]], the term "high-yellow" was associated with [[Creoles of colour]] "[[wiktionary:brahmin|brahmins]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.chss.montclair.edu/philrelg/popcults.html |title=Popular Culture as Religion: Faiths by Which We Naturally Live |author=Stephen M.

The behaviour of high yellow society was a replica of high white, except that whereas the white woman invested in tightly curled permanents and, at least if young, cultivated a deep sun tan, the colored woman used bleach lotions and [[Madam C.J.

In some cases the confusion of color with class came about because some of the lighter-skinned blacks came from families of mixed heritage free before the Civil War, who had begun to accumulate education and property. In addition, some wealthier white [[Plantations in the American South|planters]] made an effort to have their "natural sons" (the term for [[children of the plantation|children outside of marriage who were produced with enslaved women]]) educated or trained as apprentices; some passed on property to them. For instance, in 1860, most of the 200 subscription students at [[Wilberforce University|Wilberforce College]] were the mixed-race sons of white planters, who paid for their education.&lt;ref name="University1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=James T.|title=Songs of Zion : The African Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States and South Africa: The African Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States and South Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XfWCqvkp_OUC&amp;pg=PA215|accessdate=Jan 13, 2009|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-536005-9|pages=256–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Aldine Press | last = Talbert | first = Horace | title = The Sons of Allen: Together with a Sketch of the Rise and Progress of Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio | location = Xenia, Ohio | year = 1906 | url = http://docsouth.unc.edu/church/talbert/talbert.html|page=267 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These social distinctions made the cosmopolitan [[Harlem]] more appealing to many blacks.&lt;ref name="Bradbury2005" /&gt; The [[Cotton Club (New York City)|Cotton Club]] of the [[Prohibition era]] "had a [[Racial segregation|segregated]], white-only audience policy and a color-conscious, 'high yellow' hiring policy for chorus girls".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T5ZqkgzSFRMC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=high.yellow+1923|title=From Jazz to Swing: African-American Jazz Musicians and Their Music, 1890-1935|author=Thomas J.

In her 1942 ''Glossary of Harlem Slang'', [[Zora Neale Hurston]] placed "high yaller" at the beginning of the entry for colorscale, which ran:

== Applied to individuals ==
The French author [[Alexandre Dumas]], père was the son of a French [[mulatto]] [[general]] (born in [[Saint-Domingue]] but educated by his father in France) and his French wife. He was described as having skin "with a yellow so high it was almost white". In a 1929 review, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] referred to him as a "High Yellow Fictioneer".&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,737949,00.html|title=High-Yellow Fictioneer|date=September 30, 1929|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art and popular culture ==
The terminology and its cultural aspects were explored in [[Dael Orlandersmith]]'s play ''Yellowman'', a 2002 [[Pulitzer Prize]] Finalist in drama. The play depicts a dark-skinned girl whose own mother "inadvertently teaches her the pain of rejection and the importance of being accepted by the 'high yellow' boys". One reviewer described the term as having "the inherent, unwieldy power to incite black Americans with such intense divisiveness and fervor" as few others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metroweekly.com/arts_entertainment/stage.php?ak=922|title=True Colors: Insightful ''Yellowman'' at Arena Stage|author=Jolene Munch|date=March 18, 2004|work=[[Metro Weekly]]

The phrase survives in folk songs such as "[[The Yellow Rose of Texas (song)|The Yellow Rose of Texas]]", which originally referred to [[Emily West Morgan]], a "[[mulatto]]" indentured servant apocryphally associated with the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]. [[Blind Willie McTell]]'s song "Lord, Send Me an Angel" has its protagonist forced to choose among three women, described as "[[Atlanta]] yellow", "[[Macon, Georgia|Macon]] brown", and a "[[Statesboro, Georgia|Statesboro]] blackskin".&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.edu/NewsE/11_06/words.html|title=Talking about words: How Many Words?|author=Richard W.

On the 1988 album [[Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm]] by [[Joni Mitchell]], the song "Dancin' Clown" contains the lyrics "Down the street comes last word Susie, she's high yellow, looking top nice."

On [[Ice Cube]]'s album [[War and Peace Vol 2.]] released in 2000, the song "Hello" contains the lyrics "I'm looking for a big yellow, in 6-inch stilettos".

As recently as 2004, white [[rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] singer-songwriter [[Teena Marie]] released a song titled "High Yellow Girl", said to be about her daughter Alia Rose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/gbase/Music/Content?oid=57159|title=Rhythm &amp; Views: Teena Marie, La Doña|author=Gene Armstrong|date=June 3, 2004|work=[[Tucson Weekly]]|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is biracial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/premium/0199/0199-6072319.html|title=At home with Teena Marie and daughter Alia Rose|date=July 1, 2005 |work=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The related phrase "high brown" was used in [[Irving Berlin]]'s original lyrics for "[[Puttin' on the Ritz]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steffen|first=David J.|title=From Edison to Marconi: The First Thirty Years of Recorded Music|publisher=McFarland|year=2005|pages=133|isbn=0-7864-2061-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Housing insecurity''' is the lack of security in an individual [[housing|shelter]] that is the result of high housing costs relative to income, poor housing quality, unstable neighborhoods, overcrowding, and/or homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |vauthors= Johnson A, Meckstroth A |title= Ancillary services to support welfare to work. |location= Washington, DC |publisher= US Dept of Health and Human Services |date= June 22, 1998 |page= 20–23 |url= http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/isp/ancillary/front.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
Housing insecurity has been defined in a variety of ways. These methods have included income-based measures to other descriptive thresholds. Here are a few often cited definitions for housing insecurity.

Researchers from the [[University of Southern California]] propose an all encompassing measure of housing insecurity that covers a variety of characteristics, including housing instability, housing affordability, housing safety, housing quality, neighborhood safety, neighborhood quality, and homelessness. They define housing instability as households living in [[Overcrowding|overcrowded]] conditions as per the PSID. Each household head is allocated two rooms, and each additional married couple or single is allocated one room. Finally, one room is allocated for every two children and one bathroom for every four people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Robynn|last2=Rodnyansky|first2=Seva|last3=Henwood|first3=Benjamin|last4=Wenzel|first4=Suzanne |name-list-format= vanc |date=December 2017|title=Measuring Population Estimates of Housing Insecurity in the United States: A Comprehensive Approach|url=|journal=USC Center for Economic and Social Research|volume=|pages=14-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Housing affordability is defined as the ratio of annualized housing costs to annual income. Different income based measures use different thresholds; however most organizations use either the 30% or 50% threshold, meaning that an individual is housing insecure if they spend more than 30% or 50% of their annual income on housing. Housing safety is defined as a housing issue that presents an imminent health threat, such as inadequate heating capacity, faulty foundation, evidence of rodents, exposed electrical and more. Housing quality is defined as housing that is substandard but does not pose an imminent health risk, such as no cooking unit, no hot/cold water, no drinking water, faulty sewage, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Robynn|last2=Rodnyansky|first2=Seva|last3=Henwood|first3=Benjamin|last4=Wenzel|first4=Suzanne |name-list-format= vanc |date=December 2017|title=Measuring Population Estimates of Housing Insecurity in the United States: A Comprehensive Approach|url=|journal=USC Center for Economic and Social Research|volume=|pages=14-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neighborhood safety is defined as living in a neighborhood that presents imminent health threats, such as a factory is located within half a block, unit is in a flood plain, unsatisfactory police presence, and more. Neighborhood quality is defined as households in neighborhoods with undesirable characteristics that do not pose an imminent health risk, such as poor city/county services, unit is boarded up, roads need repairs, no stores within fifteen minutes, and more. [[Homelessness in the United States]] is defined as "households who define housing type at the time of interviews as either tent, cave, railroad car, unspecified housing unit, a boat, an RV, or an unoccupied site for a mobile home, trailer or tent." If an individual meets one of the above criteria, then they are considered housing insecure under this definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Robynn|last2=Rodnyansky|first2=Seva|last3=Henwood|first3=Benjamin|last4=Wenzel|first4=Suzanne |name-list-format= vanc |date=December 2017|title=Measuring Population Estimates of Housing Insecurity in the United States: A Comprehensive Approach|url=|journal=USC Center for Economic and Social Research|volume=|pages=14-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights,]] of which the United States is a signee, includes the right to adequate housing. They define adequate housing as having  security of tenure, availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure, affordability, habitability, accessibility, location, and cultural adequacy. Many of these tenants are similar to the ones above, such as availability of services (neighborhood quality), affordability, habitability (housing quality and housing safety), and location (neighborhood safety and neighborhood quality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) |title= Fact Sheet No. 21, The Human Right to Adequate Housing |date=  November 2009 |url= http://www.refworld.org/docid/479477400.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition does introduce some new factors, which are security of tenure, accessibility, and cultural adequacy. The [[United Nations|UN]] defines security of tenure as having tenure security which guarantees legal protection against forced evictions, harassment, and other threats. They define accessibility as taking into account the specific needs of disadvantaged and marginalized groups. They define cultural adequacy as respecting and taking into account the expression of cultural identity. If housing does not meet any of these criteria, it is considerate inadequate, or housing insecure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) |title= Fact Sheet No. 21, The Human Right to Adequate Housing |date=  November 2009 |url= http://www.refworld.org/docid/479477400.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Various federal agencies have put forth different definitions of housing insecurity at different times. First, in studying the health effects of housing insecurity, the [[National Institutes of Health|National Institute of Health]] has defined housing insecurity as high housing costs in proportion to income, poor housing quality, unstable neighborhoods, overcrowding, or homelessness. All of these factors are similar to those defined above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Cutts DB, Meyers AF, Black MM, Casey PH, Chilton M, Cook JT, Geppert J, Ettinger de Cuba S, Heeren T, Coleman S, Rose-Jacobs R, Frank DA |title= US Housing insecurity and the health of very young children |journal= American Journal of Public Health |volume= 101 |issue= 8 |pages= 1508–14 |date= August 2011 |pmid= 21680929 |pmc= 3134514 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.2011.300139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Center for Disease Control]] has used their own definition of housing insecurity to study disease prevention. They studied housing insecurity through a survey question that asks, "How often in the past 12 months would you say you were worried or stressed about having enough money to pay your rent/mortgage? Sometimes, Usually, or always?"&lt;ref name="Stahre_2015"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Stahre M, VanEenwyk J, Siegel P, Njai R |title= Housing Insecurity and the Association With Health Outcomes and Unhealthy Behaviors, Washington State, 2011 |language= en-us |journal= Preventing Chronic Disease |volume= 12 |pages= E109 |date= July 2015 |pmid= 26160295 |doi= 10.5888/pcd12.140511 |url= https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2015/14_0511.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]] distributes the [[American Housing Survey]] that deems that housing units which are affected by any of the descriptors below are considered to be extremely inadequate.&lt;ref name="Eggers_2013"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eggers|first=Frederick J.|last2=Moumen|first2=Fouad |name-list-format= vanc |date= March 2013 |title=American Housing survey: Housing Adequacy and Quality As Measured by the AHS|url=https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/programs-surveys/ahs/publications/HousingAdequacy.pdf|journal=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Policy Development and Research }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This list includes, "unit does not have hot and cold running water", "unit does not have a bathtub or shower", "unit does not have a flush toilet", "unit shares plumbing facilities", "unit was cold for 24 hours or more and more than two breakdowns of the heating equipment have occurred that lasted longer than 6 hours', "electricity is not used", and the "unit has exposed wiring, not every room has working electrical plugs, and the fuses have blown more than twice." Furthermore, HUD considers housing inadequate if the unit has five or six of the following structural conditions: "unit has had outside water leaks in the past 12 months', "unit has had inside water leaks in the past 12 months', "unit has holes in the floor', "unit has open cracks wider than a dime', "unit has an area of peeling paint larger than 8 by 11 inches', and "rats have been seen recently in the unit."&lt;ref name="Eggers_2013" /&gt; 

There have been calls for one unified national definition for housing insecurity, much like there is a definition of food insecurity. Researchers argue that it is difficult to study the effect of housing insecurity because it has been defined in so many different ways. A unified definition of housing insecurity will also help standardize the research on housing insecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= O'Campo |first1= Patricia |last2= Daoud |first2= Nihaya |last3= Hamilton-Wright |first3=Sarah |last4= Dunn |first4= James |name-list-format= vanc |title=Conceptualizing Housing Instability: Experiences with Material and Psychological Instability Among Women Living with Partner Violence|journal=Housing Studies|date=5 May 2015|volume=31|issue=1|pages=1–19|doi=10.1080/02673037.2015.1021768 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a working definition for housing insecurity across the federal government could allow individuals who qualify for assistance to know that they qualify.

== Rates ==
The various forms of housing insecurity have been studied in order to find which life circumstances lead families to housing insecurity. Associations between unreliable housing and factors such as [[Race (human categorization)|race]], income, and family type are especially clear. Housing insecure households are likely to consist of unmarried people. 57% of housing insecure households are made up of unmarried individuals that do not have children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.housingonline.com/2014/07/09/hud-modifies-extremely-low-income-definition/|title=HUD Modifies Extremely-Low Income Definition - NH&amp;RA|date=2014-07-09|work=NH&amp;RA|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second largest category is unmarried households with children, which makes up 21% of the distribution. 63% of housing insecure households are extremely [[low income]], which means their annual income is less than the Federal Poverty Level or 30% of the Area Median Income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.housingonline.com/2014/07/09/hud-modifies-extremely-low-income-definition/|title=HUD Modifies Extremely-Low Income Definition - NH&amp;RA|date=2014-07-09|work=NH&amp;RA|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most people facing housing insecurity are not seniors and are renters. A lack of education has an especially evident association with housing insecurity. Within housing insecure households, 18% of individuals have a [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] or [[graduate degree]], while 50% have no college experience. 55% of housing insecure households are white.&lt;ref name="housinginsecurity.org" /&gt;

Rates of housing insecurity are fairly consistent across the United States. For the majority of states, between 10% and 15% of households are housing insecure. [[Wyoming]] has the least housing insecurity while [[California]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] have the most housing insecurity; 20% of households face housing insecurity.&lt;ref name="housinginsecurity.org" /&gt;

In regards to rates of housing inadequacy defined by the [[American Housing Survey]], the number of housing units that were considered extremely inadequate fluctuated between 2005 and 2009.There were 2,021,050 extremely inadequate units that were occupied in 2005, 1,805,960 extremely inadequate units that were occupied in 2007, and 1,863,660 extremely inadequate units that were occupied in 2009. The average number of extremely inadequate units for these three years, 1,896,890 units, amounts to less than 2% of the total number of housing units in the United States. The characteristics that most frequently made units deemed extremely inadequate were shared plumbing facilities (55%) and unacceptably long cold periods (29%). 91.6% of extremely inadequate units experienced only one of the listed qualities of an extremely inadequate unit.&lt;ref name="Eggers_2013" /&gt;

== Risk factors ==
Within the last decade, researchers have found negative factors associated with housing insecurity in America. It is important to note that among these studies, many of which are cross-sectional analyses, researchers acknowledge that it is not currently possible to pinpoint the exact causes and effects.&lt;ref name="Stahre_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rollins_2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rollins|first1=Chiquita|last2=Glass|first2=Nancy E.|last3=Perrin|first3=Nancy A.|last4=Billhardt|first4=Kris A.|last5=Clough|first5=Amber|last6=Barnes|first6=Jamie|last7=Hanson|first7=Ginger C.|last8=Bloom|first8=Tina L. |name-list-format= vanc |title=Housing Instability Is as Strong a Predictor of Poor Health Outcomes as Level of Danger in an Abusive Relationship|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|date=10 October 2011|volume=27|issue=4|pages=623–643|doi=10.1177/0886260511423241}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The absence of a valid measure or universal definition for housing insecurity may be a possible reason for lack of research.&lt;ref name="Rollins_2011" /&gt; Despite these implications with research, findings across the board suggest housing insecurity is a negative risk factor when it pertains to health and educational attainment.

=== Health ===
In a study that analyzed data from the 2011 Washington State [[Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System|Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System]], 29.4% of the 8,416 respondents reported being housing insecure.&lt;ref name="Stahre_2015" /&gt; Housing insecure respondents were approximately "twice as likely to report poor or fair health status" compared to those who did not report being housing insecure.&lt;ref name="Stahre_2015" /&gt; Approximately one third of the housing insecure respondents reported delaying doctor visits due to the costs.&lt;ref name="Stahre_2015" /&gt; 26.9% of the housing insecure respondents were current smokers and "26.3% had poor or fair health".&lt;ref name="Stahre_2015" /&gt; 

Another cross-sectional analysis focusing on children from low-income households reports similar findings about the association between housing instability and medical care.&lt;ref name="Christine_2008"&gt;{{cite journal  |last= Christine|first=Ma|last2=Gee|first2=Lauren|last3=Kushel|first3=Margot |name-list-format= vanc |date=2008|title=Associations between Housing Instability and Food Insecurity with Health Care Access in Low-Income Children|url=http://proxy.lib.umich.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/208560814?accountid=14667|journal=Ambulatory Pediatrics|volume=8|issue=1|pages=50-57|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study which looks at 12,746 subjects from 2002 National Survey of America's Families data reports that "housing instability was independently associated with postponed medical care, postponed medications, and increased emergency department visits".&lt;ref name="Christine_2008" /&gt; Researchers note that a possible explanation for these associations may be due to "financial strain" and the need to prioritize other needs such as housing and food.&lt;ref name="Christine_2008" /&gt; Other health outcomes that have been associated with housing insecurity by past studies include: probable [[Generalized anxiety disorder|GAD]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]].&lt;ref name="Rollins_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suglia|first=Shakira|last2=Duarte|first2=Cristiane|last3=Sandel|first3=Megan |name-list-format= vanc |date= June 7, 2011 |title=Housing Quality, Housing Instability, and Maternal Mental Health|url=https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007%2Fs11524-011-9587-0|journal=Journal of Urban Health|volume=88|pages=1105-1116|via=Springer Link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
Evidence suggests there is link between housing insecurity and performance in school. A [[longitudinal study]] assessing the academic achievements of children in Minneapolis Public Schools reported that homeless and highly mobile children were "at greater risk for low academic achievement relative to other low-income students as well as more advantaged students."&lt;ref name="Obradović_2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Obradović J, Long JD, Cutuli JJ, Chan CK, Hinz E, Heistad D, Masten AS |title= Academic achievement of homeless and highly mobile children in an urban school district: longitudinal evidence on risk, growth, and resilience |journal= Development and Psychopathology |volume= 21 |issue= 2 |pages= 493–518 |date= May 2009 |pmid= 19338695 |doi= 10.1017/S0954579409000273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if being homeless or highly mobile are short-term or long-term risks due to few longitudinal studies and limited access to the needed data.&lt;ref name="Cutuli_2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Cutuli JJ, Desjardins CD, Herbers JE, Long JD, Heistad D, Chan CK, Hinz E, Masten AS |title= Academic achievement trajectories of homeless and highly mobile students: resilience in the context of chronic and acute risk |journal= Child Development |volume= 84 |issue= 3 |pages= 841–57 |date= 2013-05-01 |pmid= 23110492 |doi= 10.1111/cdev.12013 |pmc= 3566371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some scholars conclude the aforementioned achievement gaps with homeless and highly mobile students tend to be chronic and "may worsen among older grade cohorts."&lt;ref name="Obradović_2009" /&gt; Highly mobile students were also linked with having "increased rates of grade retention" and more "school-related problems such as expulsion or suspension", compared to other students.&lt;ref name="Cutuli_2013" /&gt;  

== Assistance ==
One source of assistance is locally located public housing agencies (PHAs) that distribute [[Section 8 (housing)|section 8]] vouchers. The vouchers are funded by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]], specifically the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]]. These vouchers help low income families or individuals pay for their rent. The PHA determines eligibility based on income, family size and citizenship. Most families that qualify are put on a waitlist, and once they get a voucher, they must be able to find their own housing, and it must meet the safety requirements of the PHA. Once the family meets all the standards, the PHA may partially pay the landlord for the family's rent, requiring the family to pay the difference, or depending on the situation, the PHA may pay for a reasonably priced home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hud.gov/topics/housing_choice_voucher_program_section_8 |title= HUD.gov / U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) |website= www.hud.gov |access-date= 2018-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) aims to create housing stability in the U.S. by increasing affordable housing and supporting government funded homes. The organization consists of 5 teams: the Research Team, the Policy Team, the Field Team, the Communications Team, and the Administration Team. The Research Team looks at statistics of housing insecurity, and the Policy Team helps inform policy makers about these trends. The Field Team raises awareness and the Communications Team gathers input from the general population about their views of housing insecurity. Finally, the Administration Team oversees the organization and regulates progress. These 5 groups all come together to combat housing insecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nlihc.org/about|title=About Us|date=2011-12-02|work=National Low Income Housing Coalition|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enterprise is another organization that has a plan to end housing insecurity by 2020. Their goal is not only to provide for low income families, but to also improve their psychological and physical well being. They have 5 pillars that they focus on: homes, systems, connections, resources, and foundation. Their objective is to provide affordable housing with systems that will provide equal opportunity for low income families. Enterprise also looks for opportunities to expand resources in the government to help those in need. Enterprise's 5 pillars come together to shape their main goal of becoming the foundation that will be strong enough to end housing insecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.enterprisecommunity.org/download?fid=2375&amp;nid=4499|title=Enterprise 2020 Strategic Plan |date=March 28, 2014 |access-date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institut français du Proche-Orient''' (IFPO), or [[France|French]] Institute of the [[Near East]], is part of the network of French Research Centres abroad. It has branches in [[Syria]],  [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]].

== History ==

The IFPO was created in 2003 by bringing together three existing French Institutes in the area : IFEAD (French Institute for [[Arab]] Studies in [[Damascus]], established in 1922), IFAPO (French Institute of near Eastern Archaeology established in [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] in 1946) and CERMOC (Centre for Study and Research on the Contemporary Middle East, est. 1977 in [[Lebanon]] and 1988 in [[Jordan]]). The IFPO has the status of a "Joint Entity of French Research Institutes Abroad" (UMIFRE no6, Unité Mixte des Instituts français de recherche à l’étranger) and is under the aegis of the [[French Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] and the [[CNRS]] (National Centre for Scientific Research).

== Fields of research and area purposes ==

IFPO is active in [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]], and hopes to be able to extend its activities to [[Iraq]] and the [[Palestinian Territories]]. Its Director-General, who is based in Damascus, is [[Eberhard Kienle]], who was preceded by [[François Burgat]] (2008-2013), Jean-Yves L’Hôpital (June 2005-May 2008) and Christian Décobert (Jan. 2003-Aug. 2004). The Institute’s tasks are research, research training, the diffusion of knowledge and cooperation with local and international institutions. These tasks are carried out with the support of the local Ministries in charge of Research and Higher Education, and in close cooperation with both. 
 
The Institute acts as a centre for study and research in all fields relating to the ancient and modern civilizations of the Near East. On the basis of the numerous activities and publications of its researchers, the institute aims at raising the French contribution to research to the highest academic standards in the various fields of research related to these civilizations, from the earliest times to the contemporary period. The Institute also trains young researchers for careers in teaching and research.

== Organization ==

The Institute is organised into three scientific departments : Archeology and Ancient History (Director Frédéric Alpi) ; Arab, Medieval and Modern Studies (director : Bruno Lory) ; Contemporary Studies (director : Myriam Catusse). 
 
In its different locations, the Institute recruits experienced researchers (at various levels in their careers) from [[France]], from the three countries in which it is established, from [[Europe]] and from the rest of the world. They come for a maximum of four years and are selected to take part in the various academic projects initiated by the Institute. It also welcomes receives young researchers (PHD candidates, grant holders, etc.) of all nationalities to take part in its activities. The duration of their stay varies according to their individual situation.
 
The Institute also awards some short-term grants for limited projects. Since many of these researchers also belong to other research teams or programmes in France and elsewhere, the Institute hopes that these projects will strengthen and broaden its academic network.

An '''inventory''' is an itemized list of [[Object (museum)|objects]] that the [[museum]] has [[Accession number (library science)|accessioned]] or received via loan(s) and must be physically located by an examiner.  A complete, one-hundred percent inventory, or a random inventory of the [[Collection (museum)|collection]] must be carried out periodically to ensure the museum is operating under best practices and for security purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy H. Dudley, Irma Bezold Wilkinson, et al., ''Museum Registration Methods'' (Washington, D.C.: American Association of Museums, 1979), 413,415.&lt;/ref&gt;   The museum is legally responsible and ethically obligated for the maintenance of up-to-date information detailing the location of all objects within the collection, including loaned items and objects that have yet to be accessioned; this is stipulated by many museum associations, including the [http://www.aam-us.org/museumresources/ethics/coe.cfm American Association of Museums].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon McKenna and Efthymia Patsatzi, ed., ''SPECTRUM: The UK Museum Documentation Standard'' (Cambridge: Museum Documentation Association, 2007), 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Necessity ==

Although inventories require a large amount of work and are not part of the more glitzy side of museum work, their value is nonetheless extremely important.  The upkeep of the collections’ inventory record is needed for minimum collections accountability.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Smith Finch, "The Essential Collections Inventory," in ''Registrars on Record: Essays on Museum Collection Management'', ed. Mary Case (Washington, D.C.: American Association of Museums, 1988),157.&lt;/ref&gt;   Inventories provide the collections manager and or the registrar with information for insurance purposes, security, and alerts staff to possible [[Art conservation and restoration|conservation]] or [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] needs of the collection.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy H. Dudley, Irma Bezold Wilkinson, et al., ''Museum Registration Methods'' (Washington, D.C.: American Association of Museums, 1979), 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security===
The completion and upkeep of and an inventory system helps to deter and aid in the early detection of theft of the collection.  The [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM) urges museums to complete and maintain their inventory systems because "If a museum does not know what is in its collection, where the works are located, and the condition they are in, it, in effect, invites theft because it will have no immediate sense that an object has disappeared, and most important, it will have no descriptive information to aid the recovery of an object in the event of a theft."&lt;ref&gt;International Council of Museums and International Committee on Museum Security, Robert B. Burke and Sam Adeloye, ed., ''A Manual of Basic Museum Security'', (Leicester, Great Britain: deVoyle, Leicester, 1986), 15-6.&lt;/ref&gt;   
&lt;br&gt;

The type of inventory system used by a museum will be dictated by the '''Collections Management Policy (CMP)'''.  The CMP will determine how often items, what items, and how many items are to be inventory.  Museums need to periodically complete a one-hundred percent inventory of their collection, but for the period in between the completion of such an inventory, a random sampling of the collection is sufficient.  A random sampling of the collection serves as an indicator for the rest of the collection.  If all the items are accounted for in a random sampling, then it can be assumed that rest of the collections’ records is just as reliable.  However, a complete inventory provides the institution with the knowledge that the entire collection can be accounted for; the random sampling is used to check the consistency of the collections’ records.

An ongoing inventory method is a system that inventories on a regular basis high value items or items that are more susceptible to theft. This method resembles an iceberg, with the high value items being at the top of the iceberg.  As the inventory method progresses further down the iceberg, items of lesser value can be found.  Items found toward the center of the iceberg, need to be inventoried less than those found higher up on the berg, and more than items found below its position.  Items at the lowest position of the iceberg, below the water’s surface, may only need to be inventoried annually.&lt;ref&gt;International Council of Museums and the International Security Committee, "Protection, security and conservation of collections," in ''Collections Management'', ed. Anne Fahy (London: Routledge, 1995), 257.&lt;/ref&gt;   With this type of inventory system, the most important or most valued objects are accounted for on a regular basis.

===Review===
Inventories serve several purposes, including the opportunity for review of the '''collections department'''.  Such review includes: 
*are all objects accounted for and found to be stored properly; 
*is there any preservation or conservation issues that need to be brought to the attention of the '''registrar''', '''collections manager''', or [[curator]]; 
*is the collections’ location records reliable?  
An inventory provides a systematic review of the collections department’s records and helps to identify any problems.  How smoothly an inventory goes is actually a reflection upon the institution.  If an inventory is completed with little or no issues, then the collections department is running well; however, if many issues arise during the inventory process, this may be indicative of a collections department in need of review and change.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy H. Dudley, Irma Bezold Wilkinson, et al., ''Museum Registration Methods'' (Washington, D.C.: American Association of Museums, 1979), 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy ==

Every museum must complete an inventory on a regular basis and this requirement should be stated in the museum’s CMP.  The CMP should also outline the steps that need to be carried out in the inventory process, including: 
*an examination of each object and its records; 
*the condition of every object should be noted; 
*any updates to records shall be made; 
*and the inventory list will be filed in the museum’s accession file.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon McKenna and Efthymia Patsatzi, ed., ''SPECTRUM: The UK Museum Documentation Standard'' (Cambridge: Museum Documentation Association, 2007), 77-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planning and scheduling ==

Sufficient time spent in planning must be devoted before beginning such a task as an inventory.  A well thought out inventory procedure will efficiently utilize staff and their time.  Such procedure should include:
# The scope and purpose of the inventory.
# Sources of funding for staff and equipment with a commitment from management for adequate time and resources to complete the inventory.
# Resources required to complete the inventory (e.g. staff hours, computers, making and labeling equipment, imaging equipment, etc.)
# Establish a timetable for the start and completion of the inventory.
# Ascertain who will run and or carry out the inventory.
# Identify the method of approach to completing the inventory, including standards used to record findings.
# How to [[Collection catalog|catalogue]] and manage information produced by the inventory and how that information will be reviewed and interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Ashby, Gordon McKenna, and Matthew Stiff, ed., ''SPECTRUM Knowledge: Standards for cultural information management'' (Cambridge: Museum Documentation Association, 2001), 30-1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Gordon McKenna and Efthymia Patsatzi, ed., ''SPECTRUM: The UK Museum Documentation Standard'' (Cambridge: Museum Documentation Association, 2007), 78.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conducting an inventory ==
[[File:Cataloguing a lion head.jpg|thumb|A taxidermied lion's head displayed in the Natural History Museum, Dublin, being labelled as part of a museum inventory and cataloguing.]]

Now that inventory policy and procedure have been established, it is time to carry out the inventory.  Conducting an inventory is the final step to the inventory process, it is relatively simple in that the actions are repetitive, but it can be one of the most time consuming parts of the inventory process depending upon the size of the collection and the intended scope of the inventory. 
&lt;br&gt;

Select a method of approach when beginning the inventory process.  How will the collection be inventoried?  Shelf by shelf; or in numerical order of the catalogue?  Once the inventory method is decided, a uniformed and basic inventory record for each object needs to be created.  Such a record might contain the following:
# Object Number
# Object Name
# Brief Description of Object
# Condition (provides opportunity to conduct a condition check of the object)
# Current Location
# Notes (any other details not included in checklist, such as alerting the need for conservation treatment)
# Recorder and Date&lt;ref&gt;Gordon McKenna and Efthymia Patsatzi, ed., ''SPECTRUM: The UK Museum Documentation Standard'' (Cambridge: Museum Documentation Association, 2007), 79.

{{spaced ndash}}&lt;small&gt;In this publication the National Park Service gives an expansive overview of the inventory process, including such topics as inventory of educational, reproductions, and living history objects; determining the value of museum objects; reporting loss of museum objects; and the list goes on with five other sections.  This work is by far the longest and most detailed publication in regards to the inventory process found thus far.&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{spaced ndash}}&lt;small&gt;Even though this book was originally published in 1991, computer databases must have still been something that only the very big museums could afford, because the inventory techniques make reference to computers yet describes how to complete an inventory using a card cataloguing system.  This work may not be that useable to most museums, but to those with out a database, the publication would be helpful.&lt;/small&gt;

{{For|the Cypriot company|KEO Ltd}}
'''KEO''' is the name of  a proposed space [[time capsule]] which was to have been launched in 2003 carrying messages from the citizens of present [[Earth]] to humanity [[Timeline of the far future#Spacecraft and space exploration|50,000]] years from now, when it would re-enter Earth's atmosphere. It was later delayed to 2006, then to 2007/2008, then to 2010/2011, then to 2012, then to 2013, then to 2015, followed by 2015/2016.&lt;ref name="dates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keo.org/Alerte.html|title=Les dates de KEO|work=keo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the KEO website cites 2019 as its launch, however, no actual date is set and information about its launch is vague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keo.org/uk/pages/faq.html#q22|title=FAQ|work=keo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its name represents the three most frequently used sounds common to the most widely spoken languages today, {{IPAslink|k}}, {{IPAslink|e}}, and {{IPAslink|o}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keo.org/uk/pages/faq.html#q1|title=FAQ|work=keo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal messages ==
Every person is invited to contribute to the time capsule. The contribution deadline was originally 31 December 2009, but {{as of|2014|lc=on}}, it has been extended to end of 2014.&lt;ref name="dates" /&gt; Messages can be posted via the project's website or sent by postal [[mail]]. The organizers encourage everybody to gather messages from children, senior citizens, and the illiterate so that every culture and demographic on Earth is represented. The organization says, "All the messages received, without undergoing any censorship, will be embarked aboard KEO." The satellite has enough capacity  to carry a four-page message from each of the more than six billion (as of the original 2009 deadline) inhabitants on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140105-timeline-of-the-far-future|title=Timeline of the far future|work=bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the satellite is launched, the messages will be made freely available on the web.

== Other contents ==
KEO will also carry a [[diamond]] that encases a drop of human [[blood]] chosen at random and samples of [[air]], [[sea water]], and [[soil|earth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edgelife.net/issues/2003/05/keo.html Edge Life Magazine, May 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408153530/http://www.edgelife.net/issues/2003/05/keo.html |date=8 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[DNA]] of the [[human genome]] will be engraved on one of the diamond's facets. The satellite will also carry an astronomical clock that shows the current rotation rates of several [[pulsar]]s, [[photograph]]s of people of all [[culture]]s, and "the contemporary [[Library of Alexandria]]", an encyclopaedic compendium of current human knowledge.

== Technical aspects ==
The messages and library will be encoded in glass-made radiation-resistant [[DVD]]s. Symbolic instructions in several formats will show the future finders how to build a DVD reader.

The satellite itself is a hollow sphere 80&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter. The sphere is engraved with a map of Earth and surrounded by an aluminium layer, a thermal layer and several layers of titanium and other heavy materials intertwined with [[vacuum]]. The sphere is resistant to [[cosmic radiation]], atmosphere re-entry, space junk impacts, etc. For its first few years in orbit, KEO will sport a pair of wings 10 meters across that will aid in its spotting from Earth. As the satellite enters the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], the thermal layer will produce an artificial [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] to give a signal of the satellite's re-entry. The passive satellite will not carry any communications or propulsion systems. It will be launched by an [[Ariane 5]] rocket into an orbit 1,800&amp;nbsp;km high, an altitude that will bring it back to Earth in 500 centuries, the same amount of time that has elapsed since early humans started to draw on cavern walls.

== Project history ==
{{Update|section|date=September 2018}}
The project KEO was conceived in 1994 by French artist-scientist [[Jean-Marc Philippe]], a pioneer of [[space art]]. Messages began to be collected, and an initial launch date was set for 2001. Technical feasibility demonstration and other various delays have moved the launch date to 2015.

== Similar projects ==
Several previous spacecraft have included time capsules for humans (or aliens) in the far future. Part of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Apollo 11 Lunar Module]], still on the moon, includes a plaque showing the arrangement of the Earth's [[continent]]s in 1969.  The [[LAGEOS]] satellite (which will re-enter the atmosphere in 8.4 million years) contains a plaque showing the arrangement of the Earth's continents in the past, present, and future. [[Pioneer 10]] and [[Pioneer 11]] both contain [[Pioneer plaque|plaques]] that give pictorial information about their time and place of origin. Most famously, the two [[Voyager program|Voyager]] spacecraft each contain a [[Voyager Golden Record|golden record]] that contains pictures and sounds of Earth, along with symbolic directions for playing the record and data detailing the location of Earth.  The Pioneers and Voyagers have left the solar system for interstellar space. In 2004, the [[Long Now Foundation]] produced  a nickel disk containing parallel texts in over a thousand languages, which was launched aboard the [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]].

'''Kete''' are traditional baskets made and used by [[New Zealand]]'s [[Māori people]]. They may be of many sizes, but are most often found in sizes similar to large handbags. Kete are traditionally woven from the leaves of New Zealand flax (''[[Phormium tenax]]'', known in [[Māori language|Māori]] as ''harakeke''), with two handles at the top. Other materials are sometimes used, including the leaves of the [[nikau palm]] and [[Cabbage tree (New Zealand)|cabbage tree]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tepuia.com/wananga_new_zealand_traditional_maori_woven_products.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In pre-European society, Māori had specific plantations of flax, which was their most important textile. It was prepared by cutting the green leaves close to the base before the leaves were split and woven. Various preparations of the leaves allowed the material to be used both as a hardy flat thick-woven material (as in kete and mats) and also as a fibrous twine, used for creating both rope and finely woven cloaks.

[[File:Price Kensington Cottage Ware.jpg|thumb|Cottage-shaped tea pot and milk jug]]

'''Kitsch''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɪ|tʃ}}; [[loanword]] from [[German language|German]]), also called '''cheesiness''' or '''tackiness''', is art or other objects that appeal to [[popular culture|popular]] rather than [[High culture|high art]] tastes. Such objects are sometimes appreciated in a knowingly [[ironic]] or humorous way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=kitsch American Heritage Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/kitsch?a=british Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/kitsch Oxford Living Dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt; The word was first applied to artwork that was a response to certain divisions of 19th-century art with [[aesthetics]] that favored what later art critics would consider to be exaggerated [[sentimentality]] and [[melodrama]]. Hence, 'kitsch art' is closely associated with 'sentimental art'. Kitsch is also related to the concept of [[camp (style)|camp]], because of its humorous and [[irony|ironic]] nature.

To brand visual art as "kitsch" is generally [[pejorative]], as it implies that the work in question is gaudy, or that it serves a solely ornamental and decorative purpose rather than amounting to a work of true artistic merit. The term is also sometimes applied to music or literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scruton|first1=Roger|authorlink1=Roger Scruton|date=Feb 21, 2014|title=A fine line between art and kitsch|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerscruton/2014/02/21/a-fine-line-between-art-and-kitsch/#7fbd667e3679|website=Forbes|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As a descriptive term, ''kitsch'' originated in the art markets of [[Munich#Capital of reunited Bavaria|Munich]] in the 1860s and the 1870s, describing cheap, popular, and marketable pictures and sketches.&lt;ref&gt;Calinescu, Matei. Five Faces of Modernity. Kitsch, p.&amp;nbsp;234.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Das Buch vom Kitsch'' (''The Book of Kitsch''), [[Hans Reimann (writer)|Hans Reimann]] defines it as a professional expression "born in a painter's studio".

The study of kitsch was done almost exclusively in German until the 1970s, with [[Walter Benjamin]] being an important scholar in the field.&lt;ref name="menninghaus"&gt;{{cite book|last=Menninghaus|first=Winfried|editor=Andrew Benjamin|others=Charles Rice|title=Walter Benjamin and the Architecture of Modernity| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFx1D_BC5tsC&amp;pg=PA40| year=2009| publisher=re.press| isbn=9780980544091| pages=39–58| chapter=On the Vital Significance of 'Kitsch': Walter Benjamin's Politics of 'Bad Taste'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modernism|Modernist]] writer [[Hermann Broch]] argues that the essence of kitsch is imitation: kitsch mimics its immediate predecessor with no regard to ethics—it aims to copy the beautiful, not the good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Broch|first=Hermann|title=Geist and Zeitgeist: The Spirit in an Unspiritual Age. Six Essays by Hermann Broch| year=2002| publisher=Counterpoint| isbn=9781582431680|chapter=Evil in the Value System of Art|pages=13–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Walter Benjamin, kitsch is, unlike art, a utilitarian object lacking all critical distance between object and observer; it "offers instantaneous emotional gratification without intellectual effort, without the requirement of distance, without sublimation".&lt;ref name="menninghaus"/&gt;

Kitsch is less about the thing observed than about the observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eaglestone|first1=Robert|title=The Broken Voice: Reading Post-Holocaust Literature|date=May 25, 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0191084204|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Roger Scruton]], "Kitsch is fake art, expressing fake emotions, whose purpose is to deceive the consumer into thinking he feels something deep and serious."&lt;ref name=Scruton&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30439633 Scruton, Roger. "A Point of View: The strangely enduring power of kitsch", ''BBC News Magazine'', December 12, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomáš Kulka in ''Kitsch and Art'' starts from two basic facts that kitsch "has an undeniable mass-appeal" and "considered (by the art-educated elite) bad" and then proposes three essential conditions: 
# Kitsch depicts a beautiful or highly emotionally charged subject; 
# The depicted subject is instantly and effortlessly identifiable
# Kitsch does not substantially enrich our associations related to the depicted subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Kitsch and art|last=Tomas|first=Kulka|date=|publisher=Pennsylvania State Univ.

[[Image:Kiryas Joel.jpg|right|300px|thumb|[[Kiryas Joel, New York]], a [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]] within the town of [[Monroe (town), New York|Monroe]] in [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]], [[New York (state)|New York]] comprised primarily by [[Yiddish]]-speaking [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[Jew]]s, had the lowest per capita income of any location with over 10,000 population in the US, as of the 2000 census.]]
{{US Income}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the following are the places in the [[United States]] with the lowest [[per capita income|per capita]] or [[median household income]]. Locations with populations from the 2010 census are ranked by median household income as surveyed between 2008 and 2012. For comparison, locations are next listed with populations per capita income from the 2000 census. The most sizable community in 2000 (with a population of 13,138) was [[Kiryas Joel]], [[New York (state)|New York]] which had a per capita income of just $4,355. In terms of geographic size, [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] and the adjacent [[Rosebud Indian Reservation]] (Lakota Sioux Reservations, South Dakota) have long been among the lowest income areas in the United States. Three of the lowest ten per capita income locations in the U.S. are on these two reservations, which constitute the three largest populations in the bottom ten locations.

''Note: This list does not include unincorporated [[territories of the United States]].''

==Locations over 1,000 population (2008-12 American Community Survey)==
The data below are for annual [[median household income]], based on 2008–2012 [[American Community Survey]] data from the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], and with populations from the 2010 U.S. Census.&lt;ref name = "census"&gt;{{cite web|title=US Census|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_5YR_DP03&amp;prodType=table|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only places with a population over 1,000 are included, as data on locations with small populations often has a very high [[margin of error]].

For comparison, the median household income for the United States is $53,046.&lt;ref name = "census"/&gt;

'''Mabel''' "'''Madea'''" '''Simmons''' is a character created and portrayed by [[Tyler Perry]]. The character is a tough elderly black woman.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R7nlzASASNsC&amp;pg=PA444&amp;dq=Madea+avenging&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LWDfUPOwDarU2QWvyYH4DQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Madea%20avenging&amp;f=false |title=Another Fine Mess: A History of American Film Comedy - Saul Austerlitz - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite her questionable methods, she stands for what's right and has a nurturing side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fw8AAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=Madea+used+to+teach+a+lesson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qejeUK2OGsKY2wXA0IGoCw&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Madea%20used%20to%20teach%20a%20lesson&amp;f=false |title=Atlanta Magazine - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As examples, Madea is often seen officiously involving herself in circumstances in which others have been wronged, offering [[self-defense]] tips, instruction, or avenging them on her own;&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; by her very nature, Madea is more than willing to "thug out" on some of the sassiest and brattiest of [[child]]ren and [[adolescence|teens]], but also shows to care about their [[well-being]] in the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u050SSGTZXcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Madea+movies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=b1zfUMy8CIbs2AWR0oCYBw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Don't Make a Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings: Madea's Uninhibited ... - Tyler Perry - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character combines an unusual pronunciation style with her locutions, such as "Heller, how ya dern?" or "Halleluyer praise da lort!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theflowonline.com/index.php?mode=magazine_detail&amp;mag_id=287 |title=Hip Hop, News, Entertainment, Social and Business Network |publisher=The Flow Online |date= |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madea is based on Perry's mother and his aunt, as well [[Eddie Murphy]]'s performance in ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]''. In Perry's own words Madea is ". . .exactly the [[PG-Rating|PG]] version of my mother and my aunt, and I loved having an opportunity to pay homage to them. She would beat the hell out of you but make sure the ambulance got there in time to make sure they could set your arm back. . ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/10/15/162936803/tyler-perry-transforms-from-madea-to-family-man |title=Tyler Perry Transforms: From Madea To Family Man |publisher=NPR |date=2012-10-15 |accessdate=2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
'''Mabel "Madea" Simmons''' was born in [[Greensburg, Louisiana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=473FLGx5ZFsC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=Madea+born+in&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V_brUI7tJOLo2AXD4IDYCA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Madea%20born%20in&amp;f=false |title=Fierce Angels: The Strong Black Woman in American Life and Culture - Sheri Parks - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; on June 26, 1931. (Madea was 68 in the first play, ''I Can Do Bad All by Myself'', as well as ''Madea's Class Reunion''. Her ages in the other plays are unknown because they take place between these two plays, and there's no continuity offered. In ''Madea Goes to Jail'', Madea was around 75). In "I Can Do Bad All by Myself," she reveals she once lived in Cleveland, Ohio, but later returned to Atlanta.

Madea was brought up in poverty and grew up living in shacks with her immediate family. Madea has stated that although her family didn't have much, they had love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dsi6IY4Jn3kC&amp;pg=PT12&amp;dq=Big+Mabel+Murphy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y3bsUPLABejy2QWrnoGgAg&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAQ |title=Don't Make a Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings: Madea's Uninhibited ... - Tyler Perry - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Family Reunion'', Madea's mother, "Big Mabel" Murphy, was a [[Prostitution|hooker]] during Madea's childhood and wasn't at all religious. As a result, Madea grew up with little knowledge of [[Christianity]] (as an elderly woman, Madea has a tendency to misquote the [[Bible]]).

She attended Booker T. Washington High School, where she served as a cheerleader. When Madea was 16, her parents moved her and the rest of her immediate family to [[Atlanta, Georgia]], in a [[shotgun house]]. It was reported in Madea's book, ''[[Don't Make a Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings]]'', that Madea's mother and father wouldn't allow her to go out at all until she turned 17 or 18.

In the films, it has been revealed that Madea used to be a stripper, and her stagenames were Magnitude and Delicious. It is heavily implied that she was a prostitute as well.

==Criminal background==
Madea has a lifelong [[criminal record]] that began at age 9 with a charge of petty [[theft]]. It is also reported that Madea was charged with her first felony at this age, and her crimes began progressing to [[illegal gambling]] at age 18, which later evolved into [[Cheque fraud|check fraud]], [[identity theft]], [[insurance fraud]] (presumably related to her nine deceased husbands), [[assault]], [[attempted murder]], vehicle theft (mostly Lexus vehicles, the first vehicle she ever stole being a 1992 [[Lexus LS400]]), [[reckless driving]] (including smashing through objects, notably a mansion gate, a [[Cadillac CTS]], and a fast food window in ''[[Diary of a Mad Black Woman]]'', ''Goes to Jail'', and ''Big Happy Family'' respectively) and forklifting vehicles out of parking spaces (usually for taking spaces that she wants to park at, as she did to many [[Toyota Camry|Camrys]] and [[Scion (automobile)|Scions]], as well as a [[Pontiac Solstice]] that she ruined in ''Madea Goes to Jail''). Throughout the series, she is a repeat offender.

In ''Diary of a Mad Black Woman'' alone, Madea and her granddaughter Helen McCarter were both charged with "criminal [[trespass]]ing, reckless [[endangerment]], criminal possession of a [[handgun]], assault with a deadly weapon, [driving on a] suspended license, expired registration, reckless driving, and a broken taillight", which placed Madea on house arrest, while her granddaughter was bailed for $5,000.

In ''Family Reunion'', she violated the terms of house arrest by taking off her house arrest bracelet but was given the opportunity to avoid jail by becoming a foster mother.

In ''Meet the Browns'', Madea was stopped by police as a normal [[traffic stop]], only to refuse to pull over (fearing that she'll be sent to jail again), which leads her into a high-speed car chase with several law enforcement officials and news helicopters.

In ''Goes to Jail'', Madea was about to get sent to jail, but was reluctantly released by Judge Mablean after learning the arresting officers did not read the Miranda rights warning when she was arrested (as the officers claimed that Madea was fighting with them), so she finally admits that her license was suspended indefinitely (implying that her license was suspended when she was 30 years old) and also gets ordered to anger management counseling, making it the very last opportunity for her to avoid jail. She, however, began driving as soon as Cora neglected her daughterly duties. Madea's brother Joe (also played by Perry) refers to her as a "po-po ho", meaning someone who is a professional at evading [[police|law enforcement]].

In ''A Madea Christmas'', Madea confides in her niece Eileen that she sold "trees"; when Eileen asks if they were Christmas trees, Madea replies that "when you smoke 'em, they make you feel like it's Christmas", implying that she once was a [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana dealer]].

==Personality==
===Hard side and language use===
Scurrilous, wise cracking, and saucy in remarks and behavior, Madea is full of comical sass and vulgar and abusive language. She also has many catch phrases, such as "You crazy as hell," and "I oughta punch you in da face!" In addition, she uses [[African American Vernacular English|Ebonics]] and other various urban expressions. Madea also intentionally adds a mispronounced "t" sound to many of her words, such as "Africant Americant", "cooking and cleanting" and "living for da Lort [Lord]."

Madea is mostly noted for her outrageous overreactions and thuggish toughness over which she has shown no shame. For example, the character has four general methods of attack:
# [[Property damage|Destruction of property]], such as demolishing others' household appliances with a chainsaw
# Weapon violence, such as stabbing others with a lit cigarette
# Physical violence, such as strangling and pounding others with her bare hands and elbows
# Intimidation through outrageous browbeating tactics and threats, such as firing off her [[Glock]] pistol, which she keeps handy with her in her purse at all times (from the extended interval of rapid-fire sounds in [[Madea Goes To Jail]], it is implied that she owns a fully automatic assault-rifle, as well, but only brings it out on "special occasions")

When using guns, Madea shoots around targets, using intimidation rather than actually killing or injuring anyone. As another form of intimidation, Madea frequently boasts of having killed in the past. As an example, she once claimed to have murdered [[Jimmy Hoffa]] over him insulting her. She also claimed to have shot [[Tupac Shakur]] while arguing over a parking space; although she claims not to have killed him in the shooting.

===Soft side===
In spite of her outrageous and shocking behaviors, Madea is consultative, protective, loving, and motherly at heart. This is heavily evidenced in ''Gets a Job'', in which Madea provides life lessons, guidance, and direction to all the residents and staff members of a nursing home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2013/02/madea-saves-all-again-%E2%80%98madea-gets-job%E2%80%99 |title=Madea saves all again in 'Madea Gets a Job' &amp;#124; HamptonRoads.com &amp;#124; PilotOnline.com |publisher=HamptonRoads.com |date=2013-02-15 |accessdate=2013-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, on numerous occasions, Madea has accepted family members who were without a place to stay into her home on her own accord. These family members have included her granddaughter Helen (''Diary of a Mad Black Woman'' film), granddaughter Vianne (''I Can Do Bad All by Myself''), her great niece Vanessa and her two kids (''Madea's Family Reunion''), and ex-convict Bobby Mitchell (''I Can Do Bad All by Myself'').

Quite often, Madea has offered direction and guidance to those who were being abused within their romantic relationships. Though much of this direction and guidance tends to come in the form of extreme warmongering, Madea's heart is always in the right place.

Madea also instructs troubled individuals about the mistakes they've made in their life choices and leads them down the path of [[forgiveness]] and improvement. While in prison in the film ''Madea Goes to Jail'', Madea attends an anger management church meeting under duress. During the meeting, Madea ends up lecturing all the women to stop playing victims, stop whining, and start taking action to improve their lives.

Madea is mentally strong and offers nurturing advice to struggling individuals whom she cares for.

===Pet peeves===
Madea has a series of [[pet peeve]]s: disrespectful youth, gum popping, rude people; lazy people; people who don't return shopping carts; [[Adultery|adulterous]] people; and "people who are just plain stupid." She is also a firm critic of men that [[Sagging (fashion)|sag their pants]], believing that it looks cheap and sloppy.

==Madea's family==
('''Note:''' There are a few discrepancies and [[plot hole]]s in Madea's family tree as between the regular films and the stage-plays)

===Madea's mother===
In the book ''Tyler Perry's Don't Make a Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings'', Madea gives details on her mother, "Big Mable" Murphy, who was described as "unusually large". "Big Mable" is characterized as being very gentle, mild-mannered, kind and peaceful woman, with a long and very dangerous fuse. In ''Madea's Family Reunion'', Madea revealed that "Big Mabel" was a [[Prostitution|hooker]] during Madea's childhood and not at all religious.

===Siblings===
'''Madea's brothers'''&lt;br /&gt;According to ''Don't Make a Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings'', Madea has several brothers. Three of them are Frederick (revealed in the book), Joe, and Heathrow (revealed in ''Madea's Family Funeral'').

::'''''Brother: Joe''''' 
::Joe (also played by Perry) is Madea's most recognizable brother as he lives with her and frequently appears in Madea films. A [[wikt:smart aleck|wise guy]] who is very coarse, misbehaved, and ornery, Joe has no qualms with such tendencies as openly farting and hurling about insulting wisecracks about people, including Madea. Despite being elderly, he constantly makes crude [[Flirting|passes]] at younger women. Joe regularly smokes marijuana in spite of his need to be on oxygen. On smoking marijuana, Joe has stated, ''"God made this for us. God made this little tree, Viagra and oxygen. Put them altogether and you can take a woman to heaven and back!"'' Joe has at least three children: Brian, Donna, and George Needleman.

::('''Note:''' The Joe character precedes the Madea character in debut, as Joe's first appearance was in the 1998 play [[''I Know I've Been Changed'']], taking place when the Madea character had not yet originated. After one other play, Madea is unveiled in the 1999 play [[I Can Do Bad All By Myself (play)|''I Can Do Bad All by Myself'']] as Joe's sister)

::::'''''Joe's children: Brian, Donna, and George'''''
::::Brian (also played by Perry) is a [[Criminal defense lawyer|criminal defense attorney]], who often gets roped into Madea's messes as he represents her in the many criminal trials Madea lands herself in. He is married to Debra and has two children, Tiffany and BJ (Brian Jr.). Joe's daughter, Donna, is married to Isaac. She appeared in ''Madea's Family Reunion''.

::::In ''Madea's Witness Protection'', Joe discovers that he has a biracial son named George Needleman with his long-lost flame Barbara. Barbara confirms this by comparing George's age to how many years ago Joe had the affair with her. However, George never finds out about this despite several hints from Joe. Therefore, George is Madea's distant nephew.

'''''Madea's sister'''''&lt;br /&gt;In ''Madea's Family Reunion'', it was revealed that Madea has an older sister named Irene Andrews, who has a son named Sonny and a daughter named Victoria. The film begins with everyone leaving Irene's funeral. Madea was shown as not caring much for her sister; in fact, not only does Madea claim she's happy Irene's died, but she has also said Irene probably died on purpose to get out of repaying Madea a $20 [[loan]]. In ''Madea Goes to Jail'', Madea helps out Sonny by letting him stay at her home rent-free.

===Madea's parenting, husbands, and children===
In ''Madea Goes to Jail'', it was revealed that Madea supported her children by [[Stripper|stripping]], [[Pole dance|pole dancing]], and [[professional wrestling]], among other things.

Madea has buried nine husbands, among them Jimmy and Johnny. Madea claims to have shot some of them and poisoned others of them with her sweet potato pie. After each husband died, they were buried quickly and Madea collected their life insurance checks. Each time it's happened, Madea has stated "I'm tryin' to get to the insurance company by five, and the casino by nine!"

'''''First husband: Johnny Simmons'''''&lt;br /&gt;Madea killed her first husband Johnny Simmons (deceased), the father of Michelle and William. Madea implies that she was glad when he died and that their marriage wasn't good. Johnny's niece Vickie appears in ''Family Reunion''; she is the mother of four sons.
:::'''''Daughter with first husband: Michelle Griffin'''''
:::Madea's daughter, Michelle Griffin, was born when Madea and her first husband, Johnny, were teenagers. Michelle grew up to be a prostitute and neglectful mother of two daughters of her own, Maylee and Vianne, who appear in the play, ''I Can Do Bad All by Myself''. Michelle's children might  have different fathers. 
:::Michelle's husband was a drunk who didn't spend enough time with either of his children. Madea explains that Michelle did not know the father of Maylee and called her "Maybe" because she was sleeping with four or five men when she got pregnant. Madea changed it to "Maylee" when she took her and Vianne out of the projects to raise them. Maylee has a 14-year-old daughter Keisha, who is also seen as pregnant.
'''''Daughter: Cora Simmons'''''&lt;br /&gt;Madea's daughter, Cora Simmons, is her most recognized and only child to appear in most of the plays and movies. Cora is 50 in ''Diary of a Mad Black Woman''. She was born in 1953 when Madea was 18. Cora is a devout Christian and is often in the company of her father Leroy Brown.

Tina and Lisa only appear in ''Family Reunion'', but are the only granddaughters to be mentioned all the time.

Cora thought that Johnny was her father until ''Class Reunion'', in which Madea reminded Cora that she [Cora] was the product of a one-night stand with Leroy Brown during their prom in 1953. This suggests that Madea is 62 years old in her first appearance, as well as in ''Madea's Class Reunion'' when her parents attend their 50th class reunion. Once Cora learned the truth, she became closer to Mr. Brown, visiting his family (in ''Meet the Browns'') and taking him to the hospital in ''What's Done in the Dark''. Their father/daughter plotline is shown on movies in ''Meet the Browns'', the TV series ''[[Tyler Perry's House of Payne]]'', and its spin-off series ''[[Meet the Browns (TV series)|Meet the Browns]]''. In the movie, ''Madea's Big Happy Family'', Cora enlists the help of [[Maury Povich]] to find out if Leroy Brown is in fact her father, after a blood test proves he is not. DNA tests reveal that Leroy Brown is not the father of Cora.

In ''Madea's Big Happy Family'' there is no apparent relation between Leroy Brown and Cora other than friends.

'''''Son: William Simmons'''''&lt;br /&gt;William is Madea's youngest and only son. Depending on the chronological order of the plays, William could be older than Cora. William is married to Myrtle. As far as the plays, Myrtle only appears in the ''Diary of a Mad Black Woman''. She is, however, mentioned in the ''I Can Do Bad All by Myself'' play. In the plays, Myrtle is in her 50s. In the film timeline, Myrtle is in her 70s, and is placed in a retirement home. This shows a natural propensity to disregard timelines humorously, because Madea herself is only in her mid-seventies.

William and Myrtle have three children: Helen, Jackie, and Gina, all of whom have either appeared or been mentioned in one of the plays (though only Helen is mentioned in the movie). William's oldest daughter, Helen, is in her mid to late 30s in ''Diary of a Mad Black Woman'', which makes William in his 50s.

Tyler Perry has confirmed that in ''A Madea Family Funeral'' (2018) Madea has another brother named Heathrow (also played by Perry), a Vietnam war veteran.

==Media &amp; entertainment featuring Madea==
Madea has appeared in several plays (some of which have been recorded for repeated viewing), fully produced films, a couple of [[television program]]s ([[guest appearance]]s), one book and one [[animation|animated film]]. The character made her first appearance in the 1999 play ''I Can Do Bad All by Myself'', later appearing in numerous other plays by Perry, then appearing in films based on those plays.

====''House of Payne'' (guest appearances)====
In the [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] [[comedy-drama]] ''[[Tyler Perry's House of Payne|House of Payne]]'' pilot episode "Bully and the Beast", Madea was the foster mother of Nikki. She factored into the plot through a school altercation between her adopted daughter and Curtis Payne's (the series' protagonist) great-nephew Malik. Curtis takes a particular disliking to Madea, who is not in the least bit intimidated by Curtis at all. Rather conversely, Curtis became intimidated by Madea and had nightmares about her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Tyler-Perry's-House-of-Payne,-Vol.-1%3A-Episodes-1-20-%5B3-Discs%5D---DVD/8625623.p?id=1761309&amp;skuId=8625623 |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;Tyler Perry's House of Payne, Vol. 1: Episodes 1-20 [3 Discs&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;#93; - DVD |publisher=Bestbuy.com |date=2007-12-04 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode "The Wench Who Saved Christmas", Curtis tries to discourage everyone from having the Christmas spirit. He later fell asleep and dreamt that Madea was the ghost of Christmas past, present, and future. In this form, she tried to teach him a lesson about his killjoy behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/tyler-perry-madea-41383.aspx |title=Preview: Tyler Perry's Madea visits House of Payne - Today's News: Our Take |publisher=TVGuide.com |date=2007-12-05 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode "Wife Swap", Curtis' wife [[Ella Payne|Ella]] chastises him for taking her for granted. That night, Curtis has an extended nightmare where he is married to Madea instead of Ella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/tyler-perrys-house-of-payne/wife-swap-1184140/ |title=Tyler Perry's House Of Payne - Season 4, Episode 1: Wife Swap |publisher=TV.com |date=2008-05-08 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parody and satire===
* In early December 2012, Madea was parodied on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' by actor [[Jamie Foxx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/09/tyler-perrys-madea-alex-cross-jamie-foxx-snl-video_n_2267547.html |title=Tyler Perry's Madea Meets 'Alex Cross' On Jamie Foxx 'SNL' Episode (VIDEO) |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2012-12-09|accessdate=2013-01-08 |first=Katla |last=McGlynn}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the ''[[American Dad!]]'' episode "[[Spelling Bee My Baby]]," [[Steve Smith (American Dad!)|Steve Smith]] deliberately misspelled his words in a [[spelling bee]] so as to express his love for [[List of American Dad! characters#Akiko Yoshida|Akiko]] (who was also competing), instead spelling random Tyler Perry/Madea films.&lt;ref name="avclub6"&gt;{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-full-cognitive-redaction-of-avery-bullock-by-t,96582/ |title="The Full Cognitive Redaction Of Avery Bullock By The Coward Stan Smith" &amp;#124; American Dad &amp;#124; TV Club &amp;#124; TV |publisher=The A.V.

* The character was parodied on ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]'' episode "[[Pause (The Boondocks)|Pause]]", in which a thinly disguised version of Perry named Winston Jerome plays a similar character to Madea called Ma Duke.&lt;ref name="braxton"&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Braxton  | first = Greg  | title = Aaron McGruder's Boondocks' lampoons Tyler Perry  | newspaper = [[The Los Angeles Times]]  | date = 2010-06-21  | url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-boondocks-20100622,0,7842614.story  | accessdate = 2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The character, and Perry himself, were both spoofed on ''[[South Park]]''{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
* Madea was spoofed in the film ''[[Scary Movie 5]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0795461/fullcredits/&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[A Haunted House 2]]'', the church ladies say they're going to see Madea's latest film, ''Madea Goes to Mars''.
* A few episodes of ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' feature a character named Auntie Momma, who is a large, loud woman, who is later revealed to be the cross-dressing alter ego of Donna's uncle Kevin.

===Orlando Jones's April Fools prank===
On April 1, 2013, [[Orlando Jones]] pulled an [[April Fools' Day]] prank, informing the public via his ''[[The Huffington Post|Huffington Post]]'' account that he would be replacing Perry as Madea. Jones led the public to believe that the decision had come amid Perry's prior obligations, assisting [[Oprah Winfrey]] with her struggling [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|OWN]] network. As part of the prank, Jones released a photo of himself to the public in which he was impersonating Madea. In addition, he incorporated several pretend quotes seemingly issued by Perry, both acknowledging the news and giving Jones his blessing to continue on with the character. Unaware of the prank, however, many fans responded with great outrage and criticism. As result of increasing outcries from fans, Perry informed the public on April 15, 2013, that the news was untrue. Perry was quoted as stating, "That was an April Fool's joke that ''HE'' did. Not true. And not funny. When I'm done with Madea, she is done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Scott |first=Tracy |url=http://s2smagazine.com/70127/tyler-perry-calls-orlando-jones-news-not-true-and-not-funny/ |title=Tyler Perry calls Orlando Jones' news 'not true and not funny' |publisher=S2SMagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128021140/http://s2smagazine.com/70127/tyler-perry-calls-orlando-jones-news-not-true-and-not-funny/ |archivedate=2014-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Perry has been accused of [[Blackface|minstrelsy]] and playing into black stereotypes with the Madea character, most notably by fellow black director [[Spike Lee]]. Perry's argument with Lee dates back to a 2009 interview in which Lee referred to Perry's films as "coonery buffoonery".&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK8ibYjciMc |title=Spike Lee on Black Enterprise |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee equated the Madea movies with the old-time [[minstrel show]]s which lampooned black people as dim-witted, lazy, buffoonish, superstitious and happy-go-lucky,&lt;ref name="coon"&gt;[http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/coon/ The Coon Character], Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia, Ferris State University. Retrieved {{date|2011-11-09}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kenrick"&gt;John Kenrick, [http://www.musicals101.com/minstrel.htm A History of the Musical: Minstrel Shows], musicals101.com. 1996, revised 2003. Retrieved {{date|2011-11-09}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and further stated that if a white director made a movie depicting black people in such a manner he would be ostracized.&lt;ref name=interview /&gt;

Perry responded by stating that his films were meant as entertainment and should not be taken so seriously. Stated Perry, "I am sick of him talking about me.  I am sick of him saying, 'This is a coon, this is a buffoon.' I am sick of him talking about black people going to see movies. This is what he said: 'You vote by what you see'—as if black people don't know what they want to see. I am sick of him. He talked about [[Whoopi Goldberg|Whoopi]], he talked about [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah]], he talked about me, he talked about [[Clint Eastwood]]. Spike needs to shut the hell up!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yamato |first=Jen |url=http://www.movieline.com/2011/04/20/madeas-tyler-perry-on-spike-lee-spike-can-go-straight-to-hell/ |title=Madea's Tyler Perry Blasts Spike Lee: 'Spike Can Go Straight to Hell!' |publisher=Movieline |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mark Fettes''' is an [[Esperantist]] and university professor of education, who has been since 2013 [[President of the World Esperanto Association|President]] of the [[World Esperanto Association]], known by its Esperanto initials as UEA.

== Career in Esperantujo ==
Fettes worked from October 1986 until January 1992 in the UEA central office as editor of the monthly magazine ''[[Esperanto (magazine)|Esperanto]]''. In this period he also re-established the UEA's public relations section; he has become known as a speaker and organizer. In 1990 he wrote an essay on the theme "One language for Europe," which won an award from the [[European Union Studies Association]] and later appeared as an official Esperanto document in several languages.

At the 77th [[World Congress of Esperanto|World Congress]] in [[Vienna]] he was elected as a UEA board member, and in 1994 he accepted the position of Secretary-General after the resignation of British Esperantist Ian Jackson. He was re-elected as Secretary-General the following year, but in 1996 he resigned that post in favour of Italian Esperantist Michela Lipari, although he remained a board member until 1998. At the 81st World Congress in [[Prague]], he launched the [[Prague Manifesto (Esperanto)|Prague Manifesto]], a multilingual document which emphasizes democratic communication, language rights, preservation of language diversity and effective language education. Fettes also organized the first [[Nitobe symposium]], organized as an homage to the Japanese author, educator and diplomat [[Nitobe Inazō]]; the symposium's proceedings later appeared in the book ''Al lingva demokratio'' ("Towards linguistic democracy").

In 1992 he became an editor of the Esperanto magazine ''[[Monato]]'', with a column ''La monda vilaĝo'' ("The global village"),&lt;ref name="Monato"&gt;Paul Peeraerts, ''Enkonduko'' ("Introduction"), in ''Monato'', January 1992 issue, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; a position he held till 1995. Fettes began working with the [[Esperantic Studies Foundation]] (ESF) in 1995 and became its first director-general in 2000. In April 2001 he organized a [[academic conference|seminar]] on Esperanto and education in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]], part of the [[Washington metropolitan area|Washington, D.C.]] [[conurbation]]. The colloquium led to the creation of two educational website projects — edukado.net and lernu.net.

In 2010, after a 12-year absence from the UEA ''Komitato'' (its governing committee), Fettes went back as a category-B member (i.e., a member-at-large). He proposed that the ''Komitato'' create a board for strategic questions; the ''Komitato'' accepted his proposal and chose him to guide the board.

At a July 20, 2013 ''Komitato'' meeting held during the 98th World Congress of Esperanto in [[Reykjavik]], Fettes was elected as the UEA's [[President of the World Esperanto Association|President]]. His role includes leading the board's "Managing development" team; he is responsible for the strategic workplan, finances, headquarters, congress policy, the [[World Esperanto Youth Organization]] (TEJO), the [[Center for Research and Documentation on World Language Problems]] and the UEA's website, uea.org&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uea.org/dokumentoj/komunikoj/gk.php?no=510#1 Gazetaraj Komunikoj de UEA], No. 510: ''Respondecoj de la novaj UEA-estraranoj'' ("Responsibilities of the new executive members"). Accessed 16 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Fettes learnt Esperanto as a 14-year-old boy, learning it on his own in [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectator.sme.sk/c/20229953/building-a-fairer-world-through-esperanto.html “Building a fairer world through Esperanto”] on The Slovak Spektator. Page accessed on the 4th of August, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 he and his family moved to Vancouver; after a year as a postdoctoral researcher at [[Simon Fraser University]], he became an assistant professor in the education faculty, where he still works. After joining the SFU faculty, Fettes joined the board of ESF, where he is currently its vice-president. In this role he was responsible for ESF's collaboration with the international youth non-profit organization [[E@I]] and the planning and development of various networking and other projects.

In 2003 he received a $1&amp;nbsp;million research grant to study the education of indigenous children. In 2010, along with a colleague, he shared a second $1&amp;nbsp;million research grant to develop an environmental public elementary school in the neighbouring city of [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia|Maple Ridge]].&lt;ref name="env-school"&gt;Janet Steffenhagen, [http://es.sd42.ca/2011/09/maple-ridge-school-lets-mother-nature-be-the-teacher/ Environmental School Project]: Place-Based Imaginative and Ecological Education in Maple Ridge, BC, ''Vancouver Sun''. Accessed 16 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The school aims to teach children about the environment and raise awareness of ecological issues. Fettes is also conducting a study to examine the differences between outdoor experiential learning and more traditional textbook learning.&lt;ref name="env-school"/&gt;

'''Mediated quasi-interaction''' is a concept in [[communication science]] that describes a monological interaction between people, which is oriented towards an indefinite range of potential recipients.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson,1995&lt;/ref&gt; It involves a fundamental asymmetry between producers and receivers.&lt;ref name="DavidHesmondhalgh"&gt;David Hesmondhalgh,2008&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of Mediated Quasi-Interaction are television, radio and newspapers and other forms of mass media.

== History ==

The concept was developed by sociologist [[John Brookshire Thompson]], a professor at the [[University of Cambridge]] and a fellow of [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]]. The concept is first documented in his book “The Rise of Mediated Interaction”, which was published in 1995 in Cambridge, UK. Thompson developed a [[conceptual framework]] for the analysis of the forms of action and interaction created by the media. He wanted to focus the types of interactional situation created by the [[mass media]].&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; He also wanted the analytical framework to examine some of the interactional features of the social relationships established by the media.&lt;ref name="Thompson_a"&gt;Thompson 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

He created the concept in part of his theory of interaction. The 3 steps theory consisted of Face-to-Face interaction, Mediated Interaction and Mediated Quasi-Interaction. Face-to- people share time and space, since they are co-present and mediated interaction the sending of the message and its reception are separated in time and space.&lt;ref name="Wouters"&gt;Wouters,2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic premises and approach ==

Mediated Quasi-interaction is monologicial in character and involves the production of symbolic forms for an indefinite range of potential recipients. Mediated Quasi-Interaction creates a certain kind of social situation in which individuals are linked together in a process of communication and symbolic exchange. It is a structured situation in which some individuals are engaged primarily in producing symbolic forms for others who are not physically present, while others are involved primarily in receiving symbolic forms produced to whom they cannot respond, but with whom they can form bonds of friendship, affection or loyalty.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

Mediated quasi-interaction is based on social relations established by media of mass communications.&lt;ref name="TerhiRantanen"&gt;Terhi Rantanen,2005&lt;/ref&gt; With mass media being impossible to be genuine interactivity, Mediated quasi-interaction is simulated interaction. It is typical for the mass media to try to simulate [[interpersonal communication]] and to personalize their communication (ex. Call-ins).&lt;ref name="PekkaIsotalus"&gt;Pekka Isotalus,1998&lt;/ref&gt; Another focus of Mediated Quasi-Interaction is also on its space-time constitution. It is described as a separation of contexts with extended availability in time and space.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

Mediated Quasi-Interaction can also be combined with other interaction such as [[dyadic communication|face-to-face]]. For example, people can sit in a room together and have a discussion while they are watching television. In a similar relation, a television program may involve face to face interaction with a panel and an audience, although the program remains primarily a form Mediated Quasi-Interaction.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3311">'''Myles Dillon''' (11 May 1900 — 18 June 1972) was an Irish historian, philologist and celticist.

Myles Dillon was born in [[Dublin]]; he was one of six children of [[John Dillon]] and his wife Elizabeth Mathew; [[James Dillon (Fine Gael politician)|James Matthew Dillon]], the leader of [[Fine Gael]], was his younger brother.

Myles Dillon graduated from [[University College Dublin]], than travelled to Germany and France, where he studied in deep Old Irish and Celtic philology under [[Joseph Vendryes]] and [[Rudolf Thurneysen]]. Dillon taught Sanskrit and comparative philology in [[Trinity College, Dublin]] (1928–1930) and [[University College, Dublin]] (1930–1937). In 1937 moved to USA, where he taught Irish in the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Madison]] (his son [[John M. Dillon]] was born in Madison), in 1946-1947 taught in Chicago. On his return to Ireland worked in the School of Celtic Studies in [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]]; was the director of the School from 1960 till 1968, edited [[Celtica (journal)|Celtica]]. Volume 11 of Celtica is dedicated to his memory. From 1966 to 1967 he was President of the [[Royal Irish Academy]].

Myles Dillon is the author of a number of important scholarly books, handbooks and translations from Old Irish. Among his most notable works are ''The Cycles of the Kings'' (1946), ''Early Irish literature'' (1948), ''The Celtic realms'' (1967, with [[Nora Kershaw Chadwick]]). M. Dillon published a modern translation and commentary of ''The Book of Rights'' ({{lang-sga|Lebor na cert}}, 1962). He also translated ''Dieux et héros des Celtes'' by [[Marie-Louise Sjoestedt]] into English, thus making the book available for a wider scholarly audience. The monograph ''Celts and Aryans'', published posthumously by the [[Indian Institute of Advanced Study]] reflects Dillon's interest in the traces of the shared heritage in the Indian and Irish cultures deriving from [[Proto-Indo-European society]] based on a period of research Dillon spent in [[Shimla|Simla]], India.

'''Nakhl Gardani''' ({{lang-fa|نخل گردانی}}, {{IPA-fa|næxl ɡærdɑːniː}}) is a [[Shia Islam|Shia]] religious ritual carried out on the [[Ashura|day of Ashura]] for commemorating the [[battle of Karbala|death]] of [[Husayn ibn Ali]], the grandson of the Prophet [[Moḥammad]] and third [[Shia]] [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imam]]. ''Nakhl'' is a wooden structure used as a symbolic representation of the Imam's [[coffin]] and ''Nakhl Gardani'' is the act of carrying the Nakhl from one place to another, resembling an Imam's [[funeral]].&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Chelkowski |first=Peter  |author-link= |editor-last= |editor-first= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica |title=NAḴL |trans-title= |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/nakl-object-in-the-mourning-rituals |access-date= |language= |edition=Online|date= |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual is carried out in many cities of Iran among them [[Yazd]],&lt;ref name="WE"/&gt; [[Kashan]]&lt;ref name="Kashan"&gt;{{cite news|title='Houm Baba'e' and 'Nakhl-Gardani' registered in National intangible heritage list|url=http://tn.ai/1089249|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=Tasnim News|language=fa}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shahrud, Iran|Shahroud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traditional Ritual of 'Nakhl-Gardani' in Shahroud|url=http://ido.ir/en/news/?id=530|website=Islamic Development Organization IR Iran|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nakhl==
''Nakhl'' (date palm&lt;ref name="Brill"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Behrens-Abouseif|first1=Doris|last2=Vernoit|first2=Stephen|title=Islamic Art in the 19th Century: Tradition, Innovation, And Eclecticism|date=2006|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004144420|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A4q58Af5zAoC&amp;pg=PA411&amp;lpg=PA411&amp;dq=nakhl|accessdate=21 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a woody structure similar to a [[cypress]] tree in shape,&lt;ref name="Dream"/&gt; symbolizing [[Husayn ibn Ali]]'s [[coffin]].&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; [[Dehkhoda]] defines ''Nakhl'' as "a big, tall bier (coffin) to which are attached daggers, swords, luxurious fabrics, and mirrors." ''Nakhls'' are constructed in various sizes, from a simple ones carried by two persons, to huge structures "supported by hundreds of men". According to [[Parviz Tanavoli]], an [[Iran]]ian [[sculpture|sculptor]], ''Nakhl'' is a "freestanding" sculpture.&lt;ref name="Brill"/&gt;

The structure is called ''Nakhl'' since it's "widely" believed that Husayn ibn Ali's body was moved to the shade of a palm tree, after his death, or because his body was carried using a coffin made of branches of palm tree, "the only material available in Karbala" at that time.&lt;ref name="Brill"/&gt;

===Yazd's Nakhl===
[[File:Nakhl in Yazd.jpg|thumb|A Nakhl in [[Yazd]]]]
As a "symbol of social unity for a town, village, or district," many ''Nakhls'' and their associated rituals are seen in [[Yazd Province]], located near the [[Dasht-e Kavir|Kavir Desert]], with every village having its own ''Nakhl''. ''Nakhl'' is often referred to as ''Naql'', i.e. "to convey carry and transfer," in Yazd and neighboring towns and villages.&lt;ref name="Brill"/&gt; Yazd is described as "''Iran’s museum of mourning tools''" by [[Jalal Al-e-Ahmad]], and is the home to the largest ''Nakhl,''&lt;ref name="Dream"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jahangir|first1=Madi|title=Nakhl-Gardani: Experiencing Passionate Ashura in Yazd|url=http://dreamofiran.com/nakhl-gardani-experiencing-passionate-ashura-in-yazd/|website=Dream of Iran|accessdate=24 September 2017|date=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which needs to be carried by "several hundred men".&lt;ref name="WE"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rubin|first1=Don|last2=Pong|first2=Chua Soo |last3=Chaturvedi|first3=Ravi |last4=Majundar|first4=Ramendu |last5=Tanokura|first5=Minoru |title=The World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: Asia/Pacific|date=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9780415260879 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=maGU4ziPQJQC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=nakhl+gardani|accessdate=20 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 8.5 meters high structure,&lt;ref name="Dream"/&gt; constructed in 1879, stands in [[Amir Chakhmaq]] square of Yazd city and is decayed and no longer used because of the safety concerns.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

==Ritual==
[[File:Nakhl Gardani Amir Chakhmaq mosque 3.jpg|thumb|Mourners carrying the Nakhl by holding the wooden columns]]
''Nakh-Gardani'' is the act of carrying ''Nakhl'', sometimes by "several strong men", on the Day of Ashura, as if it is Imam Husyan's coffin.&lt;ref name="Brill"/&gt; The ritual, historically dating back to pre-[[Safavids]] (almost 450 years ago&lt;ref name="Dream"/&gt;), is carried out at various places in Iran.&lt;ref name="Hamshahri"&gt;{{cite news|title=Familiarity with the History of the Nakhl-Gardani in Ashura|url=http://hamshahrionline.ir/details/238682|accessdate=22 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028130615/http://hamshahrionline.ir/details/238682|archive-date=28 October 2016|work=Hamshahri Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; People carrying the ''Nakhl'' on their shoulders are guided by the people standing on the Nakhl.&lt;ref name="Dream"/&gt;

The ritual is so common in Iran that in most parts of the country, either people have the ''Nakhl'' in their community or at least they know about it.&lt;ref name="Tileben"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamidi|first1=Sepideh|last2=Aref|first2=Mohammad|title=Anthropologic Study of Religious-Dramatic Ritual of Nakhl Gardani in Tileben Village|journal=Journal of Novel Applied Sciences|date=2016|page=56-63|url=http://jnasci.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/JNASCI-2016-56-63.pdf|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Archives of India''' ('''NAI''') is a repository of the non-current records of the [[Government of India]] and holds them in trust for the use of administrators and scholars. Originally established as the Imperial Record Department in 1891, in [[Calcutta]], the capital of [[British India]], the NAI is situated at the intersection of [[Janpath]] and [[Rajpath]], in [[Delhi]]. It functions as an Attached Office of the Department of Culture under the [[Ministry of Culture (India)|Ministry of Culture]], Government of India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://india.gov.in/knowindia/national_archives.php National Archives of India] [[Government of India]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
[[File:National Archives of India Campus.jpg|thumb|National Archives of India, [[New Delhi]] Campus]]
[[File:National Archives of India.jpg|thumb|National Archives of India, New Delhi]]
The Imperial Record Department was set up on 11 March 1891 in [[Calcutta]] (Kolkata). G.W. Forrest was named as department head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=104567 | title=124th Foundation Day Celebrations of National Archives of India | publisher=PIB | date=11 March 2014 | accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1911 it was transferred to the new capital, New Delhi, and in 1926 it was shifted into its new building. This was one of four museum and archive buildings planned by its architect [[Edwin Lutyens]] around 'Point B' in the city plan, the intersection of King's Way and Queen's Way. However, only this one was built. It is a building in late [[neo-classical style]], and originally known as the Imperial Record Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Architectural marvels for the new capital|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/newdelhi/Architectural-marvels-for-the-new-capital/Article1-723169.aspx|publisher=Hindustan Times|date=July 20, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102085932/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/newdelhi/Architectural-marvels-for-the-new-capital/Article1-723169.aspx|archivedate=November 2, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shri [[K.R. Narayanan]], then President of India, declared the "Museum of the National Archives" open to the general public on 6 July 1998. This museum provides a representative overview of the multifarious holdings of the National Archives, and promotes a common man's interest in archival holdings.

The NAI has a Regional Office at [[Bhopal]] and three Record Centres at [[Bhubaneswar]], [[Jaipur]] and [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]].

==Records==
The holdings in the National Archives are in a regular series starting from the year 1748. The languages of the records include English, Arabic, Hindi, Persian, Sanskrit, Modi and Urdu, and their materials include paper, palm leaf, birch bark and parchment. The records are in four categories: Public Records, Oriental Records, Manuscripts and Private Papers. 

There has been a certain amount of criticism regarding the lack of care taken in preservation and handling of records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thewire.in/139420/national-archives-of-india/|title=How the National Archives of India Is Actually Destroying History|last=Shivaram|first=Choodie|website=thewire.in|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Xhr2aR-O7c0C&amp;pg=PR42&amp;lpg=PR42&amp;dq=In+Delhi+in+the+vaults+of+the+Indian+National+Archives,+someone+installing+a+new+air+conditioning+system+had+absentmindedly+left+out+in+the+open+all+six+hundred+volumes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pl_K9AVsPK&amp;sig=rK1rsHxEVkpGRZ9XPeNA8y0BY9k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwii1eW7qZHZAhUJLI8KHTpoAyoQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20Delhi%20in%20the%20vaults%20of%20the%20Indian%20National%20Archives,%20someone%20installing%20a%20new%20air%20conditioning%20system%20had%20absentmindedly%20left%20out%20in%20the%20open%20all%20six%20hundred%20volumes&amp;f=false|title=White Mughals: Love and Betrayal in Eighteenth-Century India|last=Dalrymple|first=William|date=2004-04-27|publisher=Penguin|year=|isbn=9781101098127|location=|pages=xlii|language=en|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;...''It is also clear that some of the material is missing....'' https://www.thequint.com/lifestyle/books/book-excerpt-ornit-shani-how-india-became-democratic-election-democracy&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1855">'''Nitrogen dating''' is a form of [[relative dating]] which relies on the reliable breakdown and release of [[Amino acid |  amino acids]] from bone samples to estimate the age of the object.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Nitrogen dating - Oxford Reference|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100235613}}&lt;/ref&gt; For human bones, the assumption of about 5% nitrogen in the bone, mostly in the form of [[Collagen |  collogen]], allows fairly consistent dating techniques.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haddy|first=A.|last2=Hanson|first2=A.|date=1982-02-01|title=Research Notes and Application Reports Nitrogen and Fluorine Dating of Moundville Skeletal Samples|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-4754.1982.tb00645.x/abstract|journal=Archaeometry|language=en|volume=24|issue=1|pages=37–44|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4754.1982.tb00645.x|issn=1475-4754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to other dating techniques, Nitrogen dating can be unreliable because [[Leaching (chemistry) | leaching]] from bone is dependent on temperature, soil pH, ground water, and the presence of microorganism that digest nitrogen rich elements, like collagen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some studies compare nitrogen dating results with dating results from methods like [[fluorine absorption dating]] to create more accurate estimates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pages.ucsd.edu/~jmoore/courses/anth42web/DATINGmethods.pdf|title=Paleoanthropological methods: Dating fossils|last=Moore|first=Jim|date=|website=|publisher=UCSD|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though some situations, like thin porous bones might more rapidly change the dating created by multiple methods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:NouveauRealsime1960.jpg|thumb|The ''Nouveau Réalisme Manifesto'', signed by all of the original members in Yves Klein's apartment, 27 October 1960]]

'''Nouveau réalisme''' ('''new realism''') refers to an artistic movement founded in 1960 by the art critic [[Pierre Restany]]&lt;ref&gt;Karl Ruhrberg, Ingo F. Walther, ''Art of the 20th Century'', Taschen, 2000, p. 518. {{ISBN|3-8228-5907-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the painter [[Yves Klein]] during the first collective exposition in the Apollinaire gallery in [[Milan]].  Pierre Restany wrote the original manifesto for the group, titled the "Constitutive Declaration of New Realism," in April 1960, proclaiming, "Nouveau Réalisme—new ways of perceiving the real."&lt;ref name=Stremmel13&gt;Kerstin Stremmel, ''Realism'', Taschen, 2004, p. 13. {{ISBN|3-8228-2942-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This joint declaration was signed on 27 October 1960, in Yves Klein's workshop, by nine people: [[Yves Klein]], [[Arman]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Pierre Restany]], [[Daniel Spoerri]], [[Jean Tinguely]] and the [[Ultra-Lettrist]]s, [[Francois Dufrêne]], [[Raymond Hains]], [[Jacques de la Villeglé]]; in 1961 these were joined by [[César Baldaccini|César]], [[Mimmo Rotella]], then [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Gérard Deschamps]]. The artist [[Christo]] showed with the group. It was dissolved in 1970.&lt;ref name=Stremmel13/&gt;

Contemporary of American [[pop art]], and often conceived as its transposition in France, new realism was, along with [[Fluxus]] and other groups, one of the numerous tendencies of the [[avant-garde]] in the 1960s. The group initially chose [[Nice (France)|Nice]], on the [[French Riviera]], as its home base since [[Yves Klein|Klein]] and [[Arman]] both originated there; new realism is thus often retrospectively considered by historians to be an early representative of the {{Ill|École de Nice|fr}} movement.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary M. O'Neill, ''Art and Visual Culture on the French Riviera, 1956–1971: The Ecole de Nice'', Ashgate, 2012, p. 93. &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hains-TravailleursCommunistes.jpg|thumb|left|''Travailleurs Communistes'' by Raymond Hains]]
The term "new realism" was first used in May 1960 by Pierre Restany, to describe the works of Omiros, Arman, François Dufrêne, Raymond Hains, Yves Klein, Jean Tinguely and Jacques Villeglé as they exhibited their work in Milan. He had discussed this term before with Yves Klein (who died prematurely in 1962), who preferred the expression "today's realism" (''réalisme d'aujourd'hui'') and criticized the term "New". After the first "Manifesto of New Realism", a second manifesto, titled "40° above [[Dada]]" (''40° au-dessus de Dada'') was written between 17 May and 10 June 1961. [[César Baldaccini|César]], [[Mimmo Rotella]], [[Niki de Saint-Phalle]] (then practicing "shooting paintings") Omiros with his "free space" and [[Gérard Deschamps]] then joined the movement, followed by [[Christo]] in 1963. Klein, however, started to distance himself from the group around 1961, disliking Restany's insistence on a [[Dadaist]] heritage. 

The first exposition of the ''nouveaux réalistes'' took place in November 1960 at the Paris "''Festival d'avant-garde''".  This exposition was followed by others: in May 1961 at the Gallery J. in Paris; ''Premier Festival du Nouveau Réalisme'' in [[Nice, France|Nice]] from July til September 1961 at the Muratore Gallery and the Abbaye de Roseland; ''International Exhibition of the New Realists'', a survey of contemporary American [[pop art]] and the Nouveau Réalisme movement at the [[Sidney Janis|Sidney Janis Gallery]] in New York at the end of 1962; and at the Biennale of San Marino in 1963 (which would be the last collective show by the group). The movement had difficulty maintaining a cohesive program after the death of Yves Klein in June, 1962 and when Omiros abandonned it and decided to go in his own path experimenting with perspective and space.

==Ideas and techniques==
The members of the '''nouveaux réalistes''' group tended to see the world as an image from which they could take parts and incorporate them into their works—as they sought to bring life and art closer together. They declared that they had come together on the basis of a new and real awareness of their "collective singularity", meaning that they were together in spite of, or perhaps because of, their differences. But for all the diversity of their plastic language, they perceived a common basis for their work; this being a method of direct [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]] of reality, equivalent, in the terms used by Pierre Restany, to a "poetic recycling of urban, industrial and advertising reality".&lt;ref&gt;60/90. ''Trente ans de Nouveau Réalisme, La Différence'', 1990, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus the nouveaux réalistes advocated a return to "reality" in opposition to the lyricism of [[abstract painting]]. They also wanted to avoid what they saw as the traps of figurative art, which was seen as either [[petty-bourgeois]] or as Stalinist [[socialist realism]]. Hence the Nouveau Réalistes used exterior objects to give an account of the reality of their time. They were the inventor of the ''[[décollage]]'' technique (the opposite of collages), in particular through the use of lacerated posters—a technique mastered by François Dufrene, Jacques Villeglé, Mimmo Rotella and Raymond Hains. Often these artists worked collaboratively and it was their intention to present their artworks in the city of Paris anonymously.

Nouveau réalistes made extensive use of [[collage]] and [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]], using real objects incorporated directly into the work and acknowledging a debt to the [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]] of [[Marcel Duchamp]]. But the New Realism movement has often been compared to the pop art movement in New York for their use and critique of mass-produced commercial objects ([[Jacques de la Villeglé|Villeglé]]'s ripped cinema posters, [[Arman]]'s collections of detritus and trash), although Nouveau Réalisme maintained closer ties with Dada than with pop art.

==The new realists in architecture==
"The new realists" is also a term applied to a group of Australian architects determined to create a "New Realism" in architecture, based on the understanding of past developments in the discipline of architecture and modern day explorations of new technologies in the fields of design and building technology.

Exemple : Les compressions de César qui mettent en scène des automobiles, le but étant de transformer un objet culte de notre société et d’en faire quelque chose d'autre, à travers ses formes géométriques, l’œuvre sent la conception par l’intermédiaire d’une machine, c’est la disparition de l’habileté manuelle qui était à l’époque un facteur important dans la reconnaissance de la valeur d’un artiste.

On constate également la disparition du matériau noble, les nouveaux réalistes n’utilisent plus de bronze, de pierre, mais de la tôle ou du ciment, des matériaux industriels.

:« L’école niçoise veut nous apprendre la beauté du quotidien. Faire du consommateur un producteur d’art. Une fois qu'un être s'est intégré dans cette vision, il est très riche, pour toujours. Ces artistes veulent s'approprier le monde pour vous le donner. A vous de les accueillir ou de les rejeter. »&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Restany, ''Avec le nouveau réalisme, sur l’autre face de l’art'', Nîmes, Éditions Jacqueline Chambrons, 2000, p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

===L'objet comme matériau===
L’accumulation d’Arman, est un agglomérat de voitures de marque [[Renault (Groupe)|Renault]], chez qui il est directement allé travailler pour trouver sa matière première.

Son œuvre n’a pas d’utilité particulière mais il veut surtout le mouvement et la couleur, on ne retient plus que les effets plastiques.

Le matériel n’est pas détourné, il est utilisé pour travailler un mouvement et devient matériau.
Une autre manière de transformer un matériel en matériau selon César, c’est sa mousse de polyuréthane, c’est un matériau presque vivant qui échappe au contrôle de l’artiste, la matière se fixe ses propres limites, et l’œuvre devient indépendante du projet plastique.

Gérard Deschamps, lui, assemble des chiffons, des sous-vêtements feminins (ce qui lui vaudra d'être censuré à de nombreuses reprises) ou expose des bâches de signalisation de l'armée américaine, des plaques de blindage, des tôles irisées par la chaleur, des patchworks, des ballons dans des boîtes en plexiglas ou dans des filets, des skateboards, des « pneumostructures » faites de bouées ou de matelas pneumatiques..et des voiles de planches....a voiles.

===L’objet comme rebut===
L’œuvre de Daniel Spoerri rend compte de la société de consommation qui mange, il se sert dans les poubelles de ses voisins, de ses congénères. Il s’agit du détournement d’un moment important de la journée, qui est figé et réinvesti dans l’art. La résine est affichée contre le mur comme une toile.

Il a la volonté de fixer le temps d’un moment sensé être agréable alors que la société veut de plus en plus nous le marchandiser, et nous presser. Le repas n’est plus le moment convivial qu’il était avant, il devient la nouvelle cible des grosses sociétés de consommation, on se retrouve presque dans une succursale d’une enseigne de la restauration rapide alors que l’on est chez soi. Faire vite, faire simple, peu importe que ce soit vraiment bon. Il faut faire vite, se nourrir, manger, boulimiquement, pour se remplir, Spoerri met ici l’accent sur la nécessité d’un retour aux sources, et d’une société de consommation qui influencerait moins de ses codes, et qui submergerait moins de ses produits, la société actuelle.

Renvoyant à l'univers de la [[publicité]] et de la [[société de consommation]], les [[affiche]]s, décollées, superposées, lacérées, inspirent Jacques Villeglé, Raymond Hains et François Dufrêne ainsi que Mimmo Rotella, qui suit un itinéraire parallèle mais distinct.

===Les « Actions-spectacles »===
Il s'agit de ce qu'on appelera plus tard des "performances" où l'œuvre d'art se construit (ou se détruit) devant le public. L'un des exemples les plus connus sont les ''anthropométries'' d'Yves Klein où ce dernier enduit de jeunes femmes dénudées de peinture et leur commande de se rouler sur une toile blanche, crant ainsi la trace visuelle de leurs mouvements.--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22050">In [[markup language]]s and the [[digital humanities]], '''overlap''' occurs when a document has two or more structures that interact in a non-[[hierarchical]] manner.
A document with overlapping markup cannot be represented as a [[tree (graph)|tree]].
This is also known as '''concurrent markup'''.
Overlap happens, for instance, in [[poetry]], where there may be a [[meter (poetry)|metrical]] structure of [[foot (prosody)|feet]] and lines; a linguistic structure of sentences and quotations; and a physical structure of volumes and pages and editorial annotations.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=The problem types}}

== History ==

[[File:Frankenstein.1831.inside-cover.jpg|thumb|right|The structural differences between multiple editions of ''[[Frankenstein]]'' have been analysed with overlapping techniques.{{sfn|Piez|2014}}]]

The problem of non-hierarchical structures in documents has been recognised since 1988; resolving this problem against the dominant paradigm of text as a single hierarchy (an ''ordered hierarchy of content objects'' or ''OHCO'') was initially thought to be merely a technical issue, but has, in fact, proven much more difficult.{{sfn|Renear|Mylonas|Durand|1993}}
In 2008, [[Jeni Tennison]] identified markup overlap as "the main remaining problem area for markup technologists".{{sfn|Tennison|2008}}

== Properties and types ==

A distinction exists between schemes that allow non-contiguous overlap, and those that allow only contiguous overlap. Often, 'markup overlap' strictly means the latter.
Contiguous overlap can always be represented as a linear document with milestones (typically co-indexed start- and end-markers), without the need for fragmenting a (logical) component into multiple physical one. Non-contiguous overlap may require document fragmentation. Another distinction in overlapping markup schemes is whether elements can overlap with other elements of the same kind (''self-overlap'').{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=The problem types}}

A scheme may have a ''privileged'' hierarchy.
Some [[XML]]-based schemes, for example, represent one hierarchy directly in the XML document tree, and represent other, overlapping, structures by another means;
these are said to be ''non-privileged''.

== Approaches and implementations ==

{{harvtxt|DeRose|2004|loc=Evaluation criteria}} identifies several criteria for judging solutions to the overlap problem: readability and maintainability, tool support and compatibility with XML, possible validation schemes, and ease of processing.

[[Tag soup]] is, strictly speaking, not overlapping markup—it is malformed [[HTML]], which is a non-overlapping language, and may be ill-defined.
Some [[web browsers]] attempted to represent overlapping start and end tags with non-hierarchical [[Document Object Model]]s (DOM), but this was not standardised across all browsers and was incompatible with the innately hierarchical nature of the DOM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ln.hixie.ch/?count=1&amp;start=1037910467 | title =  Tag Soup: How UAs handle &amp;lt;x&gt; &amp;lt;y&gt; &amp;lt;/x&gt; &amp;lt;/y&gt; | author = [[Ian Hickson]] | date = 2002-11-21 | accessdate = 2017-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://hsivonen.fi/soup-dom/ | title = Tag Soup: How Mac IE 5 and Safari handle &amp;lt;x&gt; &amp;lt;y&gt; &amp;lt;/x&gt; &amp;lt;/y&gt; | author = Henri Sivonen | date = 2003-08-16 | accessdate = 2017-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[HTML5]] defines how processors should deal with such mis-nested markup in the HTML syntax and turn it into a single hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = HTML5 (Proposed Recommendation) § 8.2.8 An introduction to error handling and strange cases in the parser | author = [[W3 Consortium]] | date = 16 September 2014 | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#an-introduction-to-error-handling-and-strange-cases-in-the-parser | accessdate = 2014-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
With [[XHTML]] and [[SGML]]-based HTML, however, mis-nested markup is a strict error and makes processing by standards-compliant systems impossible.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.1. Non-SGML Notations}}
The HTML standard defines a [[paragraph]] concept which can cause overlap with other elements and can be discontiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = HTML Standard § 3.2.5.4 Paragraphs | url = https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#paragraphs | accessdate = 2017-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SGML]], which early versions of HTML were based on, has a feature called CONCUR that allows multiple independent hierarchies to co-exist without privileging any.
[[Document type definition|DTD]] validation is only defined for each individual hierarchy with CONCUR. Validation across hierarchies is not defined by the standard. CONCUR could not support self-overlap, and it interacted poorly with some of SGML's abbreviatory features.
This feature was poorly supported by tools and saw very little actual use;
using CONCUR to represent document overlap was not a recommended use case, according to a commentary by the standard's editor.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.2. CONCUR}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|log=SGML CONCUR}}

=== Within hierarchical languages ===

There are several approaches to representing overlap in a non-overlapping language.{{sfn|Di Iorio|Peroni|Vitali|2009}}
The [[Text Encoding Initiative]], as an XML-based markup scheme, cannot directly represent overlapping markup.
All four of the below approaches are suggested.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative}}
The [[Open Scripture Information Standard]] is another XML-based scheme, designed to mark up the [[Bible]].
It uses empty milestone elements to encode non-privileged components.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = OSIS Users Manual (OSIS Schema 2.1.1) | first = Patrick | last = Durusau | url = http://img.forministry.com/7/7B/7BB51FB8-84B3-4FF3-939ED473FA90A632/DOC/OSIS2_1UserManual_06March2006_-_with_O%27Donnell_edits.PDF | date = 2006 | accessdate = 2014-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To illustrate these approaches, marking up the sentences and lines of a fragment of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] will be used as a running example. Where there is a privileged hierarchy, the lines will be used.

==== Multiple documents ====
''Multiple documents'', which provide different internally consistent hierarchies. The advantage of this approach is that each document is simple and can be processed with existing tools, but requires maintenance of redundant content and it can be difficult to cross-reference between different views.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=20.1 Multiple Encodings of the Same Information}} With multiple documents, the overlap can be analysed with [[data comparison]] and [[delta encoding]] techniques, and, in an XML context, specific XML tree differencing algorithms are available.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009}}{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016}}

Example, with lines marked up:
&lt;source lang=xml&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,&lt;/line&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;Who prays continually for Richmond's good.&lt;/line&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;So much for that.—The silent hours steal on,&lt;/line&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;And flaky darkness breaks within the east.&lt;/line&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

With sentences marked up:
&lt;source lang=xml&gt;
  &lt;sentence&gt;I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,
  Who prays continually for Richmond's good.&lt;/sentence&gt;
  &lt;sentence&gt;So much for that.&lt;/sentence&gt;&lt;sentence&gt;—The silent hours steal on,
  And flaky darkness breaks within the east.&lt;/sentence&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Milestones ====
''Milestones'' are empty elements that mark the beginning and end of a component. These can be used to embed a non-privileged structure within a hierarchical language, and can only represent contiguous overlap. Existing tools will also not understand the meaning of the milestone elements and so cannot easily process or validate the non-privileged structure.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=20.2 Boundary Marking with Empty Elements}}{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.4. Milestones}} The markup being near the content is an advantage for maintainability and readability.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=TEI-style milestones}} [[CLIX (markup)|CLIX]] {{harv|DeRose|2004}} is an example of such an approach.

Example:
&lt;source lang=xml&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;&lt;sentence-start /&gt;I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,&lt;/line&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;Who prays continually for Richmond's good.&lt;sentence-end /&gt;&lt;/line&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;&lt;sentence-start /&gt;So much for that.&lt;sentence-end /&gt;&lt;sentence-start /&gt;—The silent hours steal on,&lt;/line&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;And flaky darkness breaks within the east.&lt;sentence-end /&gt;&lt;/line&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Punctuation]] and [[Space (punctuation)|inter-word spaces]] have been identified as a type of milestone-style 'crypto-overlap' or 'pseudo-markup', as the boundaries of words, clauses, sentences and the like do not necessarily align with the formal markup boundaries hierarchically.{{sfn|Birnbaum|Thorsen|2015}}{{sfn|Haentjens Dekker|Birnbaum|2017}}

==== Joins ====
''Joins'' are pointers within a privileged hierarchy to other components of the privileged hierarchy, which may be used to reconstruct a non-privileged component akin to following a [[linked list]]. A single non-privileged element is ''segmented'' into several ''partial'' elements within the privileged hierarchy; the partial elements themselves do not represent a single unit in the non-privileged hierarchy, which can be misleading and make processing difficult.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=20.3 Fragmentation and Reconstitution of Virtual Elements}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=Segmentation}} While this approach can support some discontiguous structures, it is not able to re-order elements.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.5. Fragmentation}} A slightly different approach can, however, express re-ordering by expressing the join away from the content, at the cost of directness and maintainability.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=Joins}}

Example:
&lt;source lang=xml&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;&lt;sentence id="a"&gt;I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,&lt;/sentence&gt;&lt;/line&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;&lt;sentence continues="a"&gt;Who prays continually for Richmond's good.&lt;/sentence&gt;&lt;/line&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;&lt;sentence id="b"&gt;So much for that.&lt;/sentence&gt;&lt;sentence id="c"&gt;—The silent hours steal on,&lt;/sentence&gt;&lt;/line&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;&lt;sentence continues="c"&gt;And flaky darkness breaks within the east.&lt;/sentence&gt;&lt;/line&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Stand-off markup ====
''Stand-off markup'' is similar to using joins, except that there is no privileged hierarchy: each part of the document is given a label (or might be referred to by an offset), and the document is constructed by pointing to the content from markup that 'stands off' from the content (possibly in an entirely different file), and might contain no content itself. Validation of stand-off markup is very challenging.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.6. Standoff Markup}} In addition, maintenance is a problem.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|log=Standoff markup}}

Example:
&lt;source lang=xml&gt;
  &lt;span id="a"&gt;I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span id="b"&gt;Who prays continually for Richmond's good.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span id="c"&gt;So much for that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="d"&gt;—The silent hours steal on,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span id="e"&gt;And flaky darkness breaks within the east.&lt;/span&gt;
  ...
  &lt;line contents="a" /&gt;
  &lt;line contents="b" /&gt;
  &lt;line contents="c d" /&gt;
  &lt;line contents="e" /&gt;
  &lt;sentence contents="a b" /&gt;
  &lt;sentence contents="c" /&gt;
  &lt;sentence contents="d e" /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== New languages ===

Another approach is to design an entirely new markup language.
These forego the tool support in existing languages for a less complicated semantic model and more convenient syntax.

* [[LMNL]] is a non-hierarchical markup language first described in 2002 by [[Jeni Tennison]] and [[Wendell Piez]], annotating ranges of a document with properties and allowing self-overlap. CLIX, which originally stood for 'Canonical LMNL In XML', provides a method for representing any LMNL document in a milestone-style XML document.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=CLIX and LMNL}} It also has another XML serialisation, xLMNL.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite conference | first = Wendell | last = Piez | date = August 2012 | title = Luminescent: parsing LMNL by XSLT upconversion | conference = Balisage: The Markup Conference 2012 | location = Montréal | doi = 10.4242/BalisageVol8.Piez01 | url = http://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol8/html/Piez01/BalisageVol8-Piez01.html | accessdate = 2014-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[MECS]] was developed by the [[University of Bergen]]'s [[Wittgenstein Archive]]. However, it had several problems: it allowed some non-sensical documents of overlapping elements, it could not support self-overlap, and it did not have the capacity to define a DTD-like grammar.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.7. MECS}} The theory of [[General Ordered-Descendant Directed Acyclic Graph]]s (GODDAGs), while not strictly a markup language itself, is a general data model for non-hierarchical markup. ''Restricted GODDAGs'' were designed specifically to match the semantics of MECS; general GODDAGs may be non-contiguous and need a more powerful language.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000}} [[TexMECS]] is a successor to MECS, which has a formal grammar and is designed to represent every GODDAG and nothing that is not a GODDAG.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = TexMECS: An experimental markup meta-language for complex documents | first1 = Claus | last1 = Huitfeldt | first2 = C M | last2 = Sperberg-McQuen | url = http://mlcd.blackmesatech.com/mlcd/2003/Papers/texmecs.html | date = 2003 | accessdate = 2014-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[XCONCUR]] (previously MuLaX) is a melding-together of XML and SGML's CONCUR, and also contains a validation language, XCONCUR-CL, and a [[Simple API for XML|SAX]]-like API.{{sfn|Hilbert|Schonefeld|Witt|2005}}{{sfn|Witt|Schonefeld|Rehm|Khoo|2007}}{{sfn|Schonefeld|2008}}
* Marinelli, Vitali and Zacchiroli provide algorithms to convert between restricted GODDAGs, ECLIX, LMNL, parallel documents in XML, contiguous stand-off markup and TexMECS.{{sfn|Marinelli|Vitali|Zacchiroli|2008}}

=== Graph-based formalisms ===

Rather than grounding markup information in a tree, standoff XML employs a data model based on directed graphs.{{sfn|Ide|Suderman|2007}}
As an alternative to traditional markup, such graph-based data models can be represented with formalisms originally developed for generalised directed [[multigraph]]s, most notably the [[Resource Description Framework|Resource Description Framework (RDF)]].{{sfn|Cassidy|2010|log=cassidy}}{{sfn|Chiarcos|2012|log=POWLA}}
EARMARK is an early [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]/[[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] representation that encompasses GODDAGs.{{sfn|Di Iorio|Peroni|Vitali|2009}}

RDF provides different linearizations, including an XML format that can be modeled to mirror conventional standoff XML, and a linearization that lets RDF be expressed in XML attributes ([[RDFa]]). But while it is semantically equivalent to standoff XML, it does not require special-purpose technology for storing, parsing and querying. Multiple interlinked RDF files representing a document or a corpus may constitute an example of [[Linguistic Linked Open Data]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4189">A '''pan-Germanic language''' is a [[zonal constructed language]] designed for communication amongst speakers of [[Germanic languages]]. Many of them are very similar and overlap inconsistently in orthography, phonology, and vocabulary. Of the few known efforts, [[Folkspraak]], in different incarnations, is probably the most commonly known pan-Germanic language today.

==Background==
The idea behind a zonal constructed language as such is to be easily understood by the speakers of the Germanic languages. However, due to the diversity and variation even between dialects, the largest languages: English, German, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish usually take precedence to any others. Moreover, some of the pan-languages may attempt to unify subgroups such as the [[North Germanic languages|North]] or [[West Germanic languages]].

The development of the languages are similar in its process to [[Interlingua]]—to create a word or a grammatical form samples are taken from all of the Germanic languages and the form common to most of the languages is selected. Reference is also made to previously existing and parallel Germanic zonal constructed languages.

==Overview==
The first known active and concise effort to unite the Germanic languages is '''[[Tutonish]]'''. It was developed by [[Elias Molee]] in 1901, and reformed in 1906 and 1915. It was extremely simplistic. The orthography, while straightforward, was not related to any of the existing natural Germanic languages. However, despite its shortcomings, Molee established Four Principles that provided a framework for future works.

Later in the 20th and 21st centuries, other projects have been launched as well, none of which has ever been successful, though:
* '''Euronord''' was created by linguist and Manx language scholar Adrian J. Pilgrim in 1965.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} It is chiefly based on English, Dutch, German, Norwegian, Danish and Swedish and was intended to be a zonal constructed language for Northern Europe. Unlike his predecessor Molee, Pilgrim was not as extensive in his work and little is known about Euronord.
* In 2000, a new project was presented on the Internet by Aaron Chapman, '''Folksstem''' ("De Nue Germane Kunstsprak").&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080509165345/http://www.xonus.com/muzeo/Folksstem/index.htm Folksstem (archived)]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it was renamed '''Nordien''' and '''Nordienisk'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lecorde.com/neunordien/index.php  Nordienisk]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Currently{{when|date=October 2017}}, most efforts at a Pan-Germanic concentrate around '''[[Folkspraak]]''', a collaborative project or projects, that was initiated on the internet in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dieter Nerius |title=Aktuelle Probleme der gegenwärtigen Linguistik: Schriftlinguistik, Lexikologie, Textlinguistik |year=2000 |page=95 |publisher=Universität Rostock}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, the project has not advanced much, and rifts in the Folkspraak community have given rise to various variants, including '''Middelsprake''' (by Ingmar Roerdinkholder, 2004), '''Sprak''' (by Stephan Schneider, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sprak Sprak at Wikibooks]&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Frenkisch''' (by David Parke, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lecorde.com/frenkisch/index.php Frenkisch]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Anna-Maria |last=Meyer |title=Wiederbelebung einer Utopie: Probleme und Perspektiven slavischer Plansprachen im Zeitalter des Internets |year=2014 |publisher=Univ. Bamberg Press |page=51 |quote=Das Projekt ist jedoch weniger weit ausgearbeitet als die drei im Mittelpunkt dieser Arbeit stehenden slavischen Plansprachenprojekte, und es haben sich aufgrund diverser Uneinigkeiten verschiedene Versionen herausgebildet.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Chathan''' (tcatamsck) began being made in 2007.  It has influences from Dutch/Afrikaans, German, North Germanic, Modern English, Old English, and Proto-Germanic.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.frathwiki.com/Chathan&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6425">{{New Imperialism}}
The '''Porter–MacKenzie debate''' refers to a [[historiography|historiographical disagreement]] in the field of [[Historiography of the United Kingdom|Modern British]] and [[Historiography of the British Empire|Imperial history]]. It focuses on the extent to which [[colonialism]] was an important influence within [[British culture]] during the 19th and 20th centuries. The debate was characterised by disagreement between the academic historians [[Bernard Porter]] and [[John M. MacKenzie|John MacKenzie]]. Porter argued that British imperial expansion during the era of [[New Imperialism]] had little effect on ordinary people in the United Kingdom, while MacKenzie argued that colonialism dominated British popular culture for much of the period.

==Debate==
The debate began when Porter's book ''The Absent-Minded Imperialists'' appeared in print in 2004. The book argued that Empire had very little influence on [[United Kingdom|British]] [[popular culture]] in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, arguing that this was the only explanation for the absence during a period of [[New Imperialism|rapid imperial expansion]]. Porter argued that ordinary British people between 1800 and 1940 were largely indifferent to empire:

{{quote|there can be no ''presumption'' that Britain [...] was an essentially 'imperialist' nation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Of course she was, in the sense of acquiring and ruling an empire; but that empire [...] might not have been as burdensome as it appeared. Consequently, it did not need to have had deep roots in British society — in its culture, for example — or to have affected it greatly in its turn.{{sfn|Porter|2004|p=24}} }}

''Absent-Minded Imperialists'' argued against the conclusions of previous academic studies which had stressed the extent to which imperialism had shaped European culture, following [[Edward Said]]'s ''[[Culture and Imperialism]]'' (1993).{{sfn|The Telegraph|2004}}{{sfn|Porter|2008|p=101}} Porter also attacked the conclusions of other works, like MacKenzie's 1984 ''Propaganda and Empire'' which looked at the influence of imperialist propaganda in British culture. Porter was critical of this "MacKenzie school" who argued that the influence of imperialist propaganda "must have been overwhelming if there was so much of it". According to Porter, "an alternative reading, however, might be that it could not have been all that persuasive, if the propagandists felt they needed to propagandize so hard."{{sfn|Porter|2004|p=6}} Additionally, he critiqued the source base of MacKenzie's study, suggesting that MacKenzie had selected his texts arbitrarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Absent-Minded Imperialists: Empire, Society and Culture in Britain|last=Porter|first=Bernard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book received mixed reviews, with the American historian [[Antoinette Burton]] rejecting it as not "worth arguing either with or about".{{sfn|Porter|2008|p=101}} Some academics argued that the book, which was received well in the popular press, would appeal to [[British nationalism|British nationalists]] as absolving them of responsibility for empire; a claim which Porter rejected.{{sfn|Porter|2008|pp=104-5}} In a 2008 article, MacKenzie accused Porter of sidestepping inconvenient evidence by refusing to address it directly, especially when it would affect his argument:{{sfn|MacKenzie|2008|p=662}}

{{quote|In ''Absent-Minded Imperialists'', Porter uses an [[archaeology|archaeological]] metaphor to suggest that all historians have found have been 'shards' of little structural significance. As it happens, I was trained as an archaeologist and very nearly became one. I have found a lot of shards and, to the archaeologist, an assemblage of such shards in their deposits implies the existence of a culture, not its absence.{{sfn|MacKenzie|2008|p=665}} }}

Historians who are considered to support the MacKenzie position are [[Catherine Hall]], [[Antoinette Burton]] and [[Jeffrey Richards]]. [[Andrew Thompson (historian)|Andrew Thompson]] notably supported Porter. Thompson argues that there was no one ‘imperial culture’ in the nineteenth century and that empire had a complicated position in British culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Empire Strikes Back?: The Impact of Imperialism on Britain from the Mid-Nineteenth Century|last=Thompson|first=Andrew|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=|location=Oxon|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Permanent Residence Under Color of Law''' (PRUCOL) is not recognized as an immigration status by the [[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS); this category was created by the courts and is a public benefits eligibility category. For a person to be residing "under color of law," the USCIS must know of the person’s presence in the U.S., and must provide the person with written assurance that enforcement of deportation is not planned. A person residing under PRUCOL status cannot directly apply for U.S. citizenship or sponsor family members to obtain U.S. Citizenship. 
A person from any country, who resides in the United States without current legal immigration status including, but not limited to, citizenship, permanent residency, unexpired immigrant visa, is an undocumented person. Though they are not U.S. citizens, they are considered to have the same rights as legal residents ‘for welfare eligibility purposes’. 
==Legal status==
Under what came to be known as the "PRUCOL" doctrine, expounded by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in [[Holley v. Lavine]], even an alien who was unquestionably present in the United States contrary to law could be PRUCOL. In the statutes defining eligibility criteria for federal benefits, the U.S. Congress provided for payment of benefits, not only to lawful immigrants, but to aliens "permanently residing under color of law." Thus, if the USCIS is aware of the alien's unlawful presence, but was not actively pursuing his or her deportation, the alien is eligible for benefits. Under this doctrine aliens with no legal right to remain in the United States are nevertheless eligible for public assistance. 

The [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996]] ("PRWORA") basically abolished the PRUCOL Doctrine by creating a new statutory definition of "qualified alien." It is true that the expression "permanently residing under color of law" remains in many Federal, State and City statutes and regulations; but, with a few exceptions clearly specified by statute, an alien "who is not a qualified alien is not eligible for any Federal public benefit." Congress has also made aliens ineligible for many public benefits available under State and local law.

==Children benefits==
Section 153 of the Federal Immigration Act of 1990 provides [[Special Immigrant Juvenile Status]] (SIJS) to undocumented children who (1) are under 21, (2) are unmarried, (3) have been abandoned, neglected or abused by at least one birth parent, (4) have been declared dependent on the juvenile court (often through a guardianship proceeding) or deemed eligible for long-term foster care,  and (5) for whom the court has declared that it is not in the child’s best interest to be returned to his country of origin. A grant of SIJS does not automatically confer lawful permanent resident status; instead, it makes the child eligible to apply for adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident.

Sometimes the derogatory term "[[anchor baby]]" is wrongly used to describe a child under PRUCOL status.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The confusion stems from the fact that, because children born in the U.S. of one or two undocumented parents are U.S. citizens; once they become adults they may petition for their parents to gain legal status. The person under PRUCOL status is the parent, not the baby.

If a sibling petitions for the family member who entered the US without a visa, a return to and wait in the country of origin is mandatory.

==Categories==
In general persons attain PRUCOL status by reason of a court decision of “stay of deportation”. In many cases it is left to the individual city or state benefits agency to decide if a person has this status. For additional information on one Agency’s definition of PRUCOL see Office of the New York City Mayor, Public Health Insurance Options &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909193322/http://www.nyc.gov/html/hia/html/public_insurance/immigrant_prucol.shtml|title=Public Health Insurance Options - Immigrant Eligibility - PRUCOL|date=9 September 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Florida Homestead Exemption - PRUCOL Application==
Under Florida law, only U.S. citizens, permanent resident aliens, or a someone holding PRUCOL status is eligible for a [[Homestead exemption in Florida|Homestead Exemption]]. A person in the U.S. with [[Right of asylum|asylum]] or parole [[refugee]] status is considered PRUCOL. 
A person in the US under an E-, F-, H-, J-, L-, M-, N-, O-, P-, TC- or R-class [[Travel visa|visa]] is NOT eligible for Homestead, pursuant to Rule 12D-7.007(3), Florida Administrative Code, as they are all deemed "temporary" visas. A person in the U.S. under "[[Temporary Protected Status]]" is also not eligible. This is true under Florida law no matter how long you have owned your home and lived/worked in Florida—and regardless of how many times you are legally able to renew your visa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bcpa.net/FAQ.asp#10047|title=Marty Kiar - Broward County Property Appraiser|first=Broward County Property|last=Appraiser|website=bcpa.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient times===
Human settlement in the area dates back 6,000 years. The [[Dongyi]] nationality, one of the important origins of the Chinese nation, lived here and created the [[Dawenkou]], [[Longshan culture|Longshan]] and [[Dongyeshi]] cultures. In the [[Eastern Zhou Dynasty]] (770 B.C. – 256 B.C.), the town of [[Jimo, Shandong|Jimo]] was established, which was then the second largest one in the Shandong region. The area in which Qingdao is located today was named Jiao'ao ({{lang|zh-hans|胶澳}}) when it was administered by the Qing Dynasty on 14 June 1891.

===German colonial period and Japanese occupations===

{{details|Kiautschou Bay concession}}

In 1891, the Qing Empire decided to make coastal Tsingtao (Jiao'ao) a defense base against naval attack and began to improve its fortifications. [[German Empire|Imperial German]] naval officials observed and reported on this activity during a formal survey of [[Jiaozhou Bay]] in May 1897. Subsequently, German troops seized and occupied the fortification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=By Order of the Kaiser, Otto von Diederichs and the Rise of the Imperial German Navy 1865–1902 |last=Gottschall |first=Terrell |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis |isbn=978-1-55750-309-1 |page=146 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unmodernised and ineffective Qing Empire was forced to concede the area to [[Germany]] the following year, and the [[Kiautschou Bay concession]], as it became known, existed from 1898 to 1914 (Li 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;81). With an area of {{convert|552|km2|acre sqmi}}, it was located in the imperial province of [[Shandong]] (alternately romanised as Shantung or Shan-tung) on the southern coast of the [[Shandong]] Peninsula in northern China. Jiaozhou was romanised as Kiaochow, Kiauchau or Kiao-Chau in English and Kiautschou in German. Qingdao was its administrative center. "The so-called ''Marktstrasse'' (Market street) was nothing more than the old main street of the Chinese village of Tsingtao, and the buildings lining it were the former homes of fishermen and farmers. Having sold their property, they resettled their homes and fields in the villages further east."&lt;ref name="Matzat1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsingtau.org/landmann-gottfried-1860-1926-uhrmacher-optiker-bierbrauer/ |title=Landmann Gottfried 1860–1926 Uhrmacher, Optiker, Bierbrauer |language=German |trans-title=Gottfried Landmann, 1860–1926: Watchmaker, Optician, Beer Brewer |last1=Matzat |first1=Wilhelm |last2= |first2= |date= May 2003 |work=tsingtau.org |publisher=Wilhelm Matzat |accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon gaining control of the area, the Germans outfitted the impoverished fishing village of "Tsingtao" (Qingdao) with wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply, a rarity in large parts of [[Asia]] at that time and later.&lt;ref name="Flagge"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schultz-Naumann |first1=Joachim  |authorlink1= |title=Unter Kaisers Flagge: Deutschlands Schutzgebiete im Pazifik und in China einst und heute |trans-title=Under the Kaiser's Flag: Germany's protected areas in the Pacific and in China then and now |url= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1985 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Universitas |location= |language=German |isbn=978-3-8004-1094-1 |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area had the highest school density and the highest ''per capita'' student enrollment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the [[German Empire|Imperial German]] treasury and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic]] missions.&lt;ref name="Flagge"/&gt;  Commercial interests established the Germania Brewery in 1903, which later became the world-famous [[Tsingtao Brewery]].&lt;ref name="Matzat2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsingtau.org/germania-brauerei-und-ihre-angestellten-1903-1914 |title=Germania Brauerei und ihre Angestellten 1903–1914 |language=German |trans-title=Germania Brewery and its Employees |last1=Matzat |first1=Wilhelm |last2= |first2= |date= May 2003 |work=tsingtau.org |publisher=Wilhelm Matzat |accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; German cultural and commercial influences extended to other areas of Shandong Province, including the establishment of diverse commercial enterprises.

Identified by the German authorities as a strategically important port, Qingdao was administered by the [[Reichsmarineamt|Imperial Department of the Navy]] (''Reichsmarineamt'') rather than the [[Imperial Colonial Office]] (''Reichskolonialamt'').  The growing Imperial German Navy based their [[German East Asia Squadron|Far East Squadron]] there, allowing the warships to conduct operations throughout the western [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. Beginning January 1898, the marines of ''[[Seebataillon|III. Seebataillon]]'' were based at Tsingtao. Construction of the [[Jiaoji Railway]] began on September 23, 1899, and was completed in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=斯|first1=李 |script-title=zh:1904年06月01日 胶济铁路通车|url=http://www.todayonhistory.com/6/1/jiaojitielutongche.html|website=www.todayonhistory.com|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the outbreak of [[World War I]] (1914-1918), ships of the German naval forces under [[Maximilian von Spee|Admiral Count von Spee]] were located at central Pacific colonies on routine missions.  The fleet then rendezvoused in the [[Marianas Islands]] to plan a transit back to Germany rather than be trapped in the Pacific by more powerful and numerous Allied fleets (British and Japanese).&lt;ref&gt;see [[German East Asia Squadron]], [[Battle of Coronel]] and [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]] for fleet engagements&lt;/ref&gt;

After a minor British naval attack on the German colony on Shandong in 1914, [[Japanese Empire]] troops occupied the city and the surrounding province during the [[Siege of Tsingtao]] after Japan's declaration of war on Germany in accordance with the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]].&lt;ref name="Source Records of the Great War, Vol. III, ed.

[[File:Image-Qingdao city map 1912 in german.png|thumb|right|Map of Qingdao in 1912]]
The city came under Chinese rule in December 1922, under control of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (R.O.C.) established 1912 after the [[Chinese Revolution (1911)|Chinese Revolution]] the year before. However, Japan maintained its economic dominance of the railway and the province as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Griswold, ''The Far Eastern Policy of the United States'' (1938) pp 326–28&lt;/ref&gt; The city became a [[direct-controlled municipality]] of the ROC Government in July 1929.

Japan re-occupied Qingdao in 1938, a year after its expansion of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937-1945), (a precursor to [[World War II]], 1939-1945) with its plans of territorial expansion into China's coast. Nationalist (Kuomintang) ROC forces returned after the Japanese surrender in September 1945. On June 2, 1949, shortly before the founding of the communist [[People’s Republic of China]] on October 1, 1949 the city was taken by Chairman Mao Zedong and his troops.

===Qingdao city planning and development===

====1891–1914====
The development of the Tsingtao urban space during the German-occupation (1891–1914) originated from the port. Mass urban construction began in 1898 with the relocation of Chinese dwellers along the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What is Kiaochou worth? |author=Toyokichi Iyenaga |url=https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/128/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=Oct 26, 1914 |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the completion of such series of projects as wharves, Tsingtao-Jinan Railway Line, Tsingtao Railway Station and locomotive works, a city was starting to take shape.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz-Naumann, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; The area had the highest school density and highest per capita student enrolment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Berlin treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schultz-Naumann |first1=Joachim |title=Unter Kaisers Flagge: Deutschlands Schutzgebiete im Pazifik und in China einst und heute |year=1985 |publisher=Universitas |language=German |isbn=978-3-8004-1094-1 |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, the Germans drew up for the second time the city planning of Tsingtao (Warner 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;33). The former urban area was extended for four times highlighted by the emphasis on the development of commerce and trade. [[Sun Yat-sen]] (1866–1925), leader of the [[Chinese Revolution (1911)|Chinese Revolution]] of 1911 and subsequent first president of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], visited the Tsingtau area and stated in 1912, "I am impressed. The city is a true model for China's future".&lt;ref&gt;Schultz-Naumann, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

====1914–1922====
The development of Tsingtao urban space during the first Japan-occupation period (1914–1922). In 1914, Tsingtao was taken over by Japanese and served as a base for the exploitation of natural resources of Shandong and northern China. With the development of industry and commerce, a "New City District" was established to furnish the Japanese colonists with commercial sections and living quarters, which suggested a striking contrast to the shabby houses in the local Chinese zones(Li 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;133). In the meantime, a number of schools, hospitals and public buildings were constructed, followed by urban streets and intercity highways as well. The urban spatial layout continued to expand northward along the eastern bay area.

====1922–1938====
The development of Tsingtao urban space during the ROC-ruled period (1922–1938). This period saw the substantial progress of the urban development of Tsingtao. The government engaged itself in mass construction that gave birth to villa districts at the beach and bank groups in CBD. Plenty of public buildings and facilities for the purpose of entertainment and sports were completed. By the year of 1937, the urban population numbered 385,000(Lu 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;327). Tsingtao consequently distinguished itself as a prominent holiday resort and summer retreat.

====1938–1945====
The development of Tsingtao urban space during the second Japan-occupied period (1938–1945). Japan staged a comeback to Tsingtao in 1938 and started to strive for the construction of the Greater Tsingtao in the following June. Accordingly, they worked out the City Planning of the Greater Tsingtao and the City Planning of the Mother Town (Tsingtao City Proper), even though they had not had the opportunity to realise them respectively. The period in question did not witness much urban progress except for the logical construction of No. 6 Wharf, some Japanese residences and a small number of roads and streets(Lu 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;339).

===Post–World War II===
After World War II the [[Kuomintang|KMT]] allowed Qingdao to serve as the headquarters of the Western Pacific Fleet of the [[US Navy]] in 1945. On 2 June 1949, the [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]]-led [[Chinese Red Army|Red Army]] entered Qingdao and the city and province have been under [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] control since that time.

Since the 1984 inauguration of China's open-door policy to foreign trade and investment, western Qingdao developed quickly as a port city. It is now the headquarters of the Chinese navy's northern fleet. An early example of the open-door policy occurred on 5 November 1984, when three United States Naval vessels visited Qingdao. This was the first US port call in more than 37 years to China. {{USS|Rentz|FFG-46|6}}, {{USS|Reeves|DLG-24|6}}, and {{USS|Oldendorf|DD-972|6}} and their crews were officially hosted by the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] (PLAN).

Northern Qingdao, particularly [[Shibei District|Shibei]], [[Licang District|Licang]], and [[Chengyang District|Chengyang]] districts, are now major manufacturing centers. The city has recently experienced a strong growth period, with a new central business district created to the east of the older business district. Outside of the center of the city, there is a large industrial zone, which includes chemical processing, rubber and heavy manufacturing, in addition to a growing high-tech area. Numerous local and national service companies, rather than manufacturers, are based in the city's southern district; this, as well as local wind patterns, allows Qingdao to enjoy clean, clear air year round.

==Administrative divisions==
The sub-provincial city of Qingdao has 7 [[District (PRC)|districts]] (区 ''qu'') and 3 [[county-level city|county-level cities]] (市 ''shi''):

{{Administrative divisions of Qingdao}}

Geographically, there are four districts (Shinan, Shibei, Licang and Laoshan) constituting a peninsula on the east coast of the [[Jiaozhou Bay]] as the core urban area, one (Chengyang) on the north coast and one (Xihai'an) on the west coast of the [[Yellow Sea]].

During the summer months, the beaches of Qingdao are afflicted by massive [[algal bloom]]s. The decomposing algae release large amounts of [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas, which gives off the odour of rotten eggs. The blooms of [[sea lettuce]], which are partially caused by seaweed farming in Jiangsu Province, led local officials to declare a "large-scale algae disaster" in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacobs|first=Andrew|title=Huge Algae Bloom Afflicts Coastal Chinese City|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/06/world/asia/huge-algae-bloom-afflicts-qingdao-china.html?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2006, Qingdao was estimated to be the home of about 8 million inhabitants, of which around 3 million reside in the Qingdao urban area. Another estimated 5 million live in other cities under Qingdao's jurisdiction. The annual birth rate is calculated around 76,507, with a [[birth rate]] of 10.15 per year per thousand, and a [[death rate]] of 6.32, both calculated on an annual basis. Living standards are among the highest of leading Chinese cities due to the strong export economy and relatively high family wages.

Qingdao is home to 38 [[Chinese nationalities|Chinese ethnic minorities]], which account for 0.14% of the city's total population.

There is a large Korean community in Qingdao. By 2009, there are approximately 100,000 Koreans working, studying and living in Qingdao, which makes Qingdao the second in terms of Korean population in China, following Beijing which has about 200,000 Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

An important region in Eastern China, Shandong Province has seen substantial change in its economic landscape in recent years. Much of this development has been concentrated in Qingdao.&lt;ref name="KPMG"&gt;{{Citation |year =2007 |title =Qingdao Shinan District Investment Environment Study 2007 |periodical =Report |publisher =KPMG Huazhen |url =http://www.kpmg.com.cn/redirect.asp?id=8584 |accessdate =2010-06-10 |ref = }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Qingdao has seen rapid development. With an annual growth rate of 18.9 percent in 2006, the city's GDP reached 42.3 billion, ranking first in Shandong Province and tenth out of China's top 20 cities.&lt;ref name="KPMG"/&gt; [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita comprised [[Renminbi|¥]]52,895 (US$7,616) in 2008.

In 2006, Qingdao was ranked one of six "golden cities" by the World Bank, out of 120 Chinese cities assessed on factors including investment climate and government effectiveness.&lt;ref name="KPMG"/&gt;

Internationally, Qingdao is perhaps best known for its [[Tsingtao Brewery]], founded by a German-British joint venture in 1903 that produces [[Tsingtao beer]], the best-known Chinese export beer. It is also home to [[Haier]], a large [[white goods]] manufacturer, and [[Hisense]], a major electronics company. In 2002 guitar manufacturers [[Epiphone]] opened a factory in Qingdao.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gibson Qingdao Factory – All Epiphone...

In 1984 the Chinese government named a district of Qingdao a [[Special Economic Zones of the People's Republic of China|Special Economic and Technology Development Zone]] (SETDZ). Along with this district, the entire city had gone through amazing development of secondary and tertiary industries. As an important trading port in the province, Qingdao flourishes with foreign investment and international trade. [[South Korea]] and Japan in particular made extensive investment in the city. Approximately 80,000 South Korean citizens reside there. Construction proceeds at a relatively {{weasal-inline}} fast pace in Qingdao.

In terms of primary industry, Qingdao has an estimated {{convert|50000|acre|km2}} of [[arable land]]. Qingdao has a zigzagging pattern coastline, and thus possesses an invaluable stock of fish, [[shrimp]], and other sea resources.

Qingdao is also home to a variety of mineral resources. Up to thirty different kinds have been mined. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Qingdao's [[wind power]] electricity generation performs at among the highest levels in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.compositesworld.com/articles/high-wind-in-china|title=High Wind in China|last=Gardiner|first=Ginger|website=www.compositesworld.com|access-date=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 2011, the longest bridge over water opened in Qingdao. The bridge, [[Jiaozhou Bay Bridge|Haiwan Bridge]], is {{convert|26.4|mi|1|abbr=out}} long and connects Qingdao to an offshore island, Huangdao. It would easily cross the English Channel and is almost three miles ({{convert|3|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only}}) longer than the previous record-holder, the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in the American state of Louisiana. Haiwan Bridge is supported by more than 5,000 pillars and costs about 10 billion yuan which is about 1.5 billion dollars. The bridge was designed by the Shandong Gausu Group and the construction lasted for four years. Haiwan Bridge cut the commute between the city of Qingdao and the sprawling suburb of Huangdao by 30 minutes. At least 10,000 workers toiled in two teams around the clock to build the bridge, which was constructed from opposite ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eimer|first=David|title=China builds world's longest bridge|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8248197/China-builds-worlds-longest-bridge.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=2013-03-23|location=London|date=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, the [[Qingdao Jiaozhou Bay tunnel|Jiaozhou Bay Tunnel]] opened.The tunnel brought much convenience to people by supporting public buses and making transport between the two areas more convenient.

===Intercity rail===
[[File:Qingdao Railway Station 01.jpg|thumb|right|Qingdao railway station]]

Qingdao's city proper has some major railway stations, [[Qingdao Railway Station|Qingdao Station]], [[Sifang railway station|Sifang Station]],&lt;ref&gt;Until August 2008, travelers not from Qingdao are often confused as railway tickets to Qingdao are listed as destined for "Sifang". These trains are headed to Qingdao's Sifang district. The destination's name will revert to "Qingdao" once renovations to the larger Qingdao Railway Station is complete.&lt;/ref&gt; Cangkou Station, Great-Seaport Station, etc.

===Public transport===
Qingdao's public traffic owns 5283 large and medium-sized buses, [[Compressed natural gas|CNG]] buses {{As of|2012|lc=y}}.There are also 136 [[trolleybus]]es {{As of|2012|lc=y}}. All of the buses and trolleybuses can be accessed using the Qingdao Public Traffic [[IC Card]] ({{lang|zh-hans|{{linktext|青岛|卡}}}}), which uses radio frequencies so the card does not have to physically touch the scanner. Non air-conditioned busses cost 1 yuan, The volume of road passenger transport approaches 0.8 billion per year. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The Public Transport Brand of 'Ri-Xin Bus ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|日|新|巴|士}}}})' is also known in China.

===Architecture===
[[File:Views of Qingdao.jpg|thumb|right|Qingdao retains many buildings with a German architectural style]]
There is a large number of German-style buildings in Qingdao city centre, remarkable considering the German colonial period only lasted 16 years (1898–1914). The unique combination of German and Chinese architecture in the city centre, combined with German demographic roots and a large Korean expatriate population, gives Qingdao a distinct atmosphere. An old saying described Qingdao as a city of "red tiles green trees, blue sky and blue sea." This saying indeed gives a picture of birdview of Qingdao. A larger number of areas in former foreign styles are well preserved. Although the new city area is under large-scale reconstruction, the old city area (especially the western part of [[Shinan District]]) still retains many traditional buildings.

===Language===
During the city's colonial days, [[German language|German]] was the official language and rigorously taught and promoted. Since the demise of Germany's colonial empire during World War I, the German language is virtually dead here and left little impact on the local languages. A local accent known as [[Qingdao dialect]] (青岛话, pinyin ''qingdao hua'') distinguishes the residents of the city from those of the surrounding [[Shandong]] province. Due to the efforts by the city government to promote standard [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], most educated people can speak standard Mandarin in addition to their native dialect. With reform policies and English teaching, some young citizens have been taught English and many can converse with English-speaking foreigners. Business and traffic signs in English are becoming more and more common.

===Cuisine===
Seafood is a typical delicacy of the coastal city, divided into two categories: "Great Seafood" including [[sea cucumber (food)|sea cucumber]]s, [[abalone]]s, [[shark]]'s fin, [[prawn]]s, crabs, [[conch]], and some big fish, and "Little Seafood" comprising [[squid]], [[shrimp]]s, [[octopus]], [[oyster]]s, razor clams, [[clam]]s, [[Littorina|periwinkle]]s, [[yellow croaker]]s, etc.

The distinctive cuisine of the area is [[Shandong cuisine|Lu Cai]], the [[Shandong]] regional style.

===Festivals===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 137-014950, Tsingtau, Ankunft der Turner auf dem Festplatz.jpg|thumb|Festival in Qingdao in 1913]]
Notable festivals include:
*[[Qingdao International Horticultural Exposition 2014]] is the biggest international fair that has been held in the history of the city.

===2008 Olympic Summer Games===
Along with Beijing's hosting of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], Qingdao was the host city for the Olympic Sailing competitions which took place along the shoreline by the city. These events were hosted at the [[Qingdao International Sailing Centre]] and held in [[Fushan Bay]], near the city's central business district. A hotel and an international broadcasting centre were built.

===Football===

Qingdao is recognized as one of the "football cities" in China, due to dozens of preeminent players it trained like [[Qu Bo (footballer)|Qu Bo]], [[Zheng Long]], [[Yu Dabao]], [[Liu Jian (footballer)|Liu Jian]] and [[Jiang Ning]] .However, due to lack of money of the sponsors of football clubs in Qingdao, its football potential has reduced.

[[Qingdao Jonoon F.C.]] (previously named Qingdao Hainiu Football Club) was founded in 1993. It is one of the founding members of the second-division of Chinese professional football league. They got the championship in their first season in 1994 and were promoted to the [[Chinese Jia-A League]]. In 1995, they finished 11th (out of a total 12 teams) and were relegated from the top league. Only one year later, after finishing as runner-up in the second-division, they returned to the top league. They have been part of [[Chinese Super League]] from its inauguration in 2004.In 2013, they were relegated to the [[China League One]] and in 2016 relegated to the [[China League Two]].

[[Qingdao Huanghai F.C.]]  was established on 29 January 2013. In their first season in the Chinese Football Association Division Two League, they finished the first in league and got to the [[China League One]]. Up to June 13, 2016, they had been on the first and had a great chance to get into the Super League after the season. Fans in China called them "Chinese [[Barcelona F.C.|Barcelona]]".

===Basketball===
[[Qingdao DoubleStar Eagles]] is a Chinese professional basketball team which plays in the North Division of the [[Chinese Basketball Association]].

===Badminton===
[[Qingdao Renzhou Badminton Club]] is a Chinese badminton club which plays in the [[China Badminton Super League]].

===Arena Football===
[[Qingdao Clipper]] is a professional [[arena football]] team which is a member of the [[China Arena Football League]](CAFL).

===Motorsport===
The [[IZOD IndyCar Series]] signed a contract with the Qingdao city council to hold an [[IndyCar]] race in Qingdao in 2012. The race was supposed to take place on a {{convert|3.87|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} street circuit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/indycar-series-confirms-china-race|title=INDYCAR: Series Confirms China Race|last=IndyCar|date=10 November 2011|work=SPEED Channel|publisher=Fox Sports|accessdate=2011-11-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113000145/http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/indycar-series-confirms-china-race/|archivedate=13 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/indycar-scheduled-august-race-in-china-has-been-canceled/2012/06/13/gJQAE8bZaV_story.html|title=IndyCar scheduled August race in China has been canceled|publisher=Washington Posts|accessdate=2012-06-16}}{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surfing===
Qingdao is one of the few cities in northern China where surfing is possible. The best surfing season is during the typhoon season (June–October). The south oriented beaches of Qingdao are the most appropriate to receive swells. Shinan and Laoshan districts are reported to have the best wave and wind orientation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12476">'''Semantic folding''' theory describes a procedure for encoding the [[semantics]] of [[natural language]] text in a semantically grounded [[Binary number|binary representation]]. This approach provides a framework for modelling how language data is processed by the [[neocortex]].{{r|webber}}

==Theory==
Semantic folding theory draws inspiration from [[Douglas Hofstadter|Douglas R. Hofstadter]]'s ''Analogy as the Core of Cognition'' which suggests that the brain makes sense of the world by identifying and applying [[Analogy|analogies]].{{r|hofstadter}} The theory hypothesises that semantic data must therefore be introduced to the neocortex in such a form as to allow the application of a [[similarity measure]] and offers, as a solution, the [[sparse matrix|sparse]] [[bit array|binary vector]] employing a two-dimensional topographic [[semantic space]] as a distributional reference frame. The theory builds on the computational theory of the human cortex known as [[hierarchical temporal memory]] (HTM), and positions itself as a complementary theory for the representation of language semantics.

A particular strength claimed by this approach is that the resulting binary representation enables complex semantic operations to be performed simply and efficiently at the most basic computational level.

== Two-dimensional semantic space ==
Analogous to the structure of the neocortex, Semantic Folding theory posits the implementation of a semantic space as a two-dimensional grid. This grid is populated by context-vectors&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A context-vector is defined as a vector containing all the words in a particular context.&lt;/ref&gt; in such a way as to place similar context-vectors closer to each other, for instance, by using competitive learning principles. This [[vector space model]] is presented in the theory as an equivalence to the well known word space model&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:189276/FULLTEXT01|title=The Word-Space Model|last=Sahlgreen|first=Magnus|date=2006|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; described in the [[Information retrieval|Information Retrieval]] literature.

Given a semantic space (implemented as described above) a word-vector&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A word-vector or word-SDR is referred to as a Semantic Fingerprint in Semantic Folding theory.&lt;/ref&gt; can be obtained for any given word Y by employing the following [[algorithm]]:

For each position X in the semantic map (where X represents [[Cartesian coordinate system|cartesian coordinates]])
     if the word Y is contained in the context-vector at position X
          then add 1 to the corresponding position in the word-vector for Y
     else 
          add 0 to the corresponding position in the word-vector for Y

The result of this process will be a word-vector containing all the contexts in which the word Y appears and will therefore be representative of the semantics of that word in the semantic space. It can be seen that the resulting word-vector is also in a sparse distributed representation (SDR) format [Schütze, 1993] &amp; [Sahlgreen, 2006].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.41.8856|title=Word Space|last=Schütze|first=Hinrich|date=1993|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some properties of word-SDRs that are of particular interest with respect to computational semantics are:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* high [[Noise and Resistance|noise resistance]]: As a result of similar contexts being placed closer together in the underlying map, word-SDRs are highly tolerant of false or shifted "bits".
* [[Boolean algebra|boolean]] logic: It is possible to manipulate word-SDRs in a meaningful way using boolean (OR, AND, exclusive-OR) and/or [[Arithmetical operations|arithmetical]] (SUBtract) functions .
* sub-sampling: Word-SDRs can be sub-sampled to a high degree without any appreciable loss of semantic information.
* topological two-dimensional representation: The SDR representation maintains the topological distribution of the underlying map therefore words with similar meanings will have similar word-vectors. This suggests that a variety of measures can be applied to the calculation of [[semantic similarity]], from a simple overlap of vector elements, to a range of distance measures such as: [[Euclidean distance]], [[Hamming distance]], [[Jaccard index|Jaccard distance]], [[cosine similarity]], [[Levenshtein distance]], [[Sørensen–Dice coefficient|Sørensen-Dice index]], etc.

== Semantic spaces ==
Semantic spaces&lt;ref group="note"&gt;also referred to as distributed semantic spaces or distributed semantic memory&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baroni|first=Marco|last2=Lenci|first2=Alessandro|title=Distributional Memory: A General Framework for Corpus-Based Semantics|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/coli_a_00016|journal=Computational Linguistics|volume=36|issue=4|pages=673–721|doi=10.1162/coli_a_00016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the natural language domain aim to create representations of natural language that are capable of capturing meaning. The original motivation for semantic spaces stems from two core challenges of natural language: [[Vocabulary mismatch]] (the fact that the same meaning can be expressed in many ways) and [[ambiguity]] of natural language (the fact that the same term can have several meanings).

The application of semantic spaces in [[natural language processing]] (NLP) aims at overcoming limitations of [[Rule-based system|rule-based]] or model-based approaches operating on the [[Keyword research|keyword]] level. The main drawback with these approaches is their brittleness, and the large manual effort required to create either rule-based NLP systems or training corpora for model learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Scott C.

Research in semantic spaces dates back more than 20 years. In 1996, two papers were published that raised a lot of attention around the general idea of creating semantic spaces: [[latent semantic analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lsa.colorado.edu/papers/plato/plato.annote.html|title=LSA: A Solution to Plato's Problem|website=lsa.colorado.edu|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Microsoft]] and [[Hyperspace Analogue to Language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lund|first=Kevin|last2=Burgess|first2=Curt|date=1996-06-01|title=Producing high-dimensional semantic spaces from lexical co-occurrence|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03204766|journal=Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, &amp; Computers|language=en|volume=28|issue=2|pages=203–208|doi=10.3758/BF03204766|issn=0743-3808}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[University of California, Riverside|University of California]]. However, their adoption was limited by the large computational effort required to construct and use those semantic spaces. A breakthrough with regard to the [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]] of modelling associative relations between words (e.g. "spider-web", "lighter-cigarette", as opposed to synonymous relations such as "whale-dolphin", "astronaut-driver") was achieved by [[explicit semantic analysis]] (ESA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Evgeniy Gabrilovich  |author2=Shaul Markovitch |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2007|title=Computing Semantic Relatedness using Wikipedia-based Explicit Semantic Analysis|url=http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~gabr/papers/ijcai-2007-sim.pdf|journal=Proc. 20th Int'l Joint Conf. on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI). pp. 1606–1611.|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007. ESA was a novel (non-machine learning) based approach that represented words in the form of vectors with 100,000 [[dimension]]s (where each dimension represents an Article in [[Wikipedia]]). However practical applications of the approach are limited due to the large number of required dimensions in the vectors.

More recently, advances in [[Neural networks|neural networking]] techniques in combination with other new approaches ([[tensor]]s) led to a host of new recent developments: [[Word2vec]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|arxiv=1310.4546|title=Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality|author1=Tomas Mikolov |author2=Ilya Sutskever |author3=Kai Chen |author4=Greg Corrado |author5=Jeffrey Dean |date=2013|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Google]] and [[GloVe (machine learning)|GloVe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf|title=GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation|author1=Jeffrey Pennington |author2=Richard Socher |author3=Christopher D. Manning |date=2014|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Stanford University]].

Semantic folding represents a novel, biologically inspired approach to semantic spaces where each word is represented as a sparse binary vector with 16,000 dimensions (a semantic fingerprint) in a 2D semantic map (the semantic universe). Sparse binary representation are advantageous in terms of computational efficiency, and allow for the storage of very large numbers of possible patterns.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite arXiv|arxiv=1503.07469|title=Properties of Sparse Distributed Representations and their Application to Hierarchical Temporal Memory|author1=Subutai Ahmad |author2=Jeff Hawkins |date=2015|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visualization==
[[File:Semantic fingerprint comparing the terms "dog" and "car".png|thumb|Semantic fingerprint image comparing the terms "dog" and "car".]]
[[File:Semantic fingerprint comparing the terms "jaguar" and "Porsche".png|thumb|Semantic fingerprint image comparing the terms "jaguar" and "Porsche"]]
The topological distribution over a two-dimensional grid (outlined above) lends itself to a [[bitmap]] type visualization of the semantics of any word or text, where each active semantic feature can be displayed as e.g. a [[pixel]]. As can be seen in the images shown here, this representation allows for a direct visual comparison of the semantics of two (or more) linguistic items.

Image 1 clearly demonstrates that the two disparate terms "dog" and "car" have, as expected, very obviously different semantics.

Image 2 shows that only one of the meaning contexts of  "jaguar", that of "Jaguar" the car, overlaps with the meaning of Porsche (indicating partial similarity). Other meaning contexts of "jaguar" e.g. "jaguar" the animal clearly have different non-overlapping contexts.

Note also that the visualization of semantic similarity using Semantic Folding bears a strong resemblance to the [[fMRI]] images produced in a research study conducted by A.G. Huth et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huth|first1=Alexander|title=Natural speech reveals the semantic maps that tile human cerebral cortex|journal=Nature|date=27 April 2016|issue=7600|pages=453–458|doi=10.1038/nature17637|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v532/n7600/abs/nature17637.html|accessdate=19 October 2016|volume=532|pmid=27121839|pmc=4852309|bibcode=2016Natur.532..453H}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is claimed that words are grouped in the brain by meaning.

'''The Nelson Rooms''' is a [[grade II listed]] building in [[Monmouth]], [[Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]]. It is in the historic [[Glendower Street, Monmouth|Glendower Street]] and Agincourt Street neighbourhood, within the [[Monmouth Town Walls and Defences|medieval town walls]]. The building initially served as a gymnasium and was a gift from [[Lady Llangattock]] to the town of Monmouth. In 1924, after the benefactor's death, it reopened as the [[Monmouth Museum|Nelson Museum]], and showcased the collection of memorabilia related to [[Admiral Horatio Nelson]] that had been amassed by the baroness. The Nelson Museum moved to new quarters at the [[Market Hall, Monmouth|Market Hall]] in 1969. The former gymnasium and museum is now an apartment building.

==History==

[[File:Lady Llangattock groves.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Portrait of [[Lady Llangattock]] by H. Groves]]
The Nelson Rooms at 2 Glendower Street in Monmouth is a 19th-century, grade II [[listed building]].&lt;ref name=coflein&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nelson Rooms, Glendower Street, No. 2, Monmouth|url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/404433/details/THE+NELSON+ROOMS,+GLENDOWER+STREET,+NO.+2,+MONMOUTH/|work=coflein.gov.uk|publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=blb&gt;{{cite web|title=Nelson Rooms, Monmouth|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-85056-nelson-rooms-monmouth|work=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk|publisher=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located at the corner of Glendower Street and Agincourt Street, within the medieval town walls. The street on which it is situated was referred to as Grinders Street in the medieval period.&lt;ref name=coflein/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A history of the charities of William Jones (founder of the "Golden lectureship" in London), at Monmouth &amp; Newland|year=1899|publisher=W.

It was built by Lady Llangattock (1837–1923) as the Working Men's Gymnasium.&lt;ref name=coflein/&gt;&lt;ref name=nndb&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Stewart Rolls|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/183/000177649/|work=nndb.com|publisher=Soylent Communications – [[NNDB|NNDB (Notable Names Database)]]|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Llangatock, née Georgiana Marcia Maclean, was the wife of [[John Allan Rolls, 1st Baron Llangattock]] (1837–1912). Lord and Lady Llangattock were the parents of four children, including their youngest son [[Charles Stewart Rolls]] (1877–1910).&lt;ref name=nndb/&gt;&lt;ref name=peer&gt;{{cite news|title=A Famous Peer|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19121026.2.3|accessdate=30 May 2012|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=26 October 1912|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their son Charles co-founded [[Rolls-Royce Limited]] and was an aviation enthusiast. In 1910, he became the first Englishman to die in an aviation accident when his [[Wright Flyer|Wright biplane]] crashed at [[Bournemouth]].&lt;ref name=nndb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Rolls|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/halloffame/historical_figures/charles_rolls.shtml|work=bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Llangattock lost her husband and all three of her sons in a six-year period. Lord Llangattock died in October 1912, and their two surviving sons, [[John Maclean Rolls]] and Henry Allan Rolls, both died in 1916 during World War I.&lt;ref name=nndb/&gt;&lt;ref name=peer/&gt;

Georgiana Rolls donated the Working Men's Gymnasium to the town of Monmouth in the late 19th century. In 1901, [[Kelly's Directory]] of Monmouthshire referred to the gym on Glendower Street as the Monmouth Gymnasium and revealed that it was staffed by John B. Hyam and Ernest William Hyam.&lt;ref name=here&gt;{{cite news|title=Monmouth and Its Rich Past|url=http://herefordshire.greatbritishlife.co.uk/article/monmouth-and-its-rich-past-town-heritage-shopping-herefordshire-18133/|accessdate=29 May 2012|newspaper=Herefordshire Life|date=19 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130113235709/http://herefordshire.greatbritishlife.co.uk/article/monmouth-and-its-rich-past-town-heritage-shopping-herefordshire-18133/|archivedate=13 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kelly&gt;{{cite web|title=Kelly's Directory of Monmouthshire 1901 – Monmouth|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~familyalbum/kmon6.htm|work=freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com|publisher=hosted by roots web|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former, with the title Honorable Secretary, presumably was the John Benjamin Hyam who appeared on the same record as a manufacturer and merchant at [[Hyam's Mineral Water Works]].&lt;ref name=kelly/&gt; While the connection of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson]] to Monmouth was somewhat tenuous, Georgiana, Lady Llangatock, became an avid collector of memorabilia related to the admiral. The Nelson Collection was a bequest to Monmouth from Lady Llangattock upon her death in 1923.&lt;ref name=here/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nelson Museum &amp; Local History Centre|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/wales/south-wales/monmouth-trefynwy/sights/museum/nelson-museum-local|work=lonelyplanet.com|publisher=BBC – Lonely Planet|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nelson Museum was established at the former Monmouth Gymnasium in 1924 and the collection amassed by Lady Llangattock formed the core of its offerings. One of the most renowned items in the museum's collection is the set of leather-bound volumes containing the letters of Horatio Nelson to his spouse, one of them holding the wedding ring of Lady Nelson.&lt;ref name=coflein/&gt;&lt;ref name=natarc&gt;{{cite web|title=Nelson Manuscripts at Monmouth Museum|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/nra/onlinelists/GB1355%20NELSON.pdf|work=nationalarchives.gov.uk|publisher=Nelson Museum and Local History Centre|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, the Misses F. and G.

In addition to the admiral's relics, the Monmouth Museum's collection includes information about Lady Llangattock's famed son Charles Stewart Rolls.&lt;ref name=gtj&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Market Hall fire, Monmouth, 1963|url=http://www.gtj.org.uk/en/large/item/GTJ02004/|work=www.gtj.org.uk|publisher=Gathering the Jewels|accessdate=30 May 2012}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monmouthshire|url=http://www.civictrustwales.org/ehd/programme%202011/monmouth.html|work=civictrustwales.org|publisher=Open Doors 2011 – European Heritage Days in Wales|accessdate=29 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120727233427/http://www.civictrustwales.org/ehd/programme%202011/monmouth.html|archivedate=27 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the museum's transfer to Priory Street, the history collections for Monmouth were included in the exhibits.

==Design==

[[File:HoratioNelson1.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson]]]]
The building at Glendower Street is thought to have been the design of Benjamin Lawrence, a [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] architect who designed the [[1 Monk Street, Monmouth|Working Men's Free Institute]] at 1 Monk Street for Lady Llangattock as well. Lawrence was also the architect of the [[Monmouth Baptist Church]] on [[Monk Street, Monmouth|Monk Street]].&lt;ref name=coflein/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonconformity in Monmouth|url=http://www.capeli.org.uk/uploads/newsletter_29.pdf|work=capeli.org.uk|publisher=The Chapels Heritage Society|accessdate=29 May 2012|author=Keith Kissack|page=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building derives its current name, The Nelson Rooms, from the Nelson Museum which was housed there before the museum's move in 1969. It was grade II listed on 8 October 2005.&lt;ref name=blb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gtj/&gt;

During the interval since the move of the museum, the building served for a time as an auction venue, and more recently has been converted to residential apartments. In February 2006, an application was submitted to the [[Monmouthshire County Council]], requesting permission to convert the listed building to three flats; approval was granted the following August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File|url=http://idox.monmouthshire.gov.uk/WAM/findCaseFile.do;jsessionid=DE11287FB9F7A04AD0F01F50B04ECF61?appNumber=DC%2F2006%2F00034&amp;appType=Planning&amp;action=Search|work=idox.monmouthshire.gov.uk|publisher=Monmouthshire County Council|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monmouthshire County Council – Weekly List of Registered Planning Applications|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:mKlA75IwmdYJ:www.monmouthshire.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/853/mcc_dc_application_registration_list_2006_wk14+Nelson+Rooms,+Glendower+Street,+Monmouthshire+County+Council&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgo9K_LzpGcYv84gSpyv4t-ugCPtaeFCCAtWQndIoTzQIgPp6tpdpUDD8Hr8VhB7AkNymqvwvxwACurUDgvLz-CBvdFxtIUKxHF52MhXArOpYGUBAe83oe177ygBqAsXc18jp8n&amp;sig=AHIEtbQGoiYMN8-mxlT_GFg-VHx6oU_5EQ|work=monmouthshire.gov.uk|publisher=Monmouthshire County Council|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2008, another application was submitted to the Monmouthshire County Council, requesting that further renovation of the Glendower Street building be permitted for its continued use as apartments; the modifications were approved the following June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monmouthshire County Council – Weekly List of Registered Planning Applications|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:-qBeVDQNBSMJ:www.monmouthshire.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/1037/mcc_dc_application_registration_list_2008_wk18+Nelson+Rooms,+Glendower+Street,+Monmouthshire+County+Council&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESis4F012Poq35u215LBcdTKomK4OQfuxFHt5VwKFUfHWF6EaznQG-hlU1lA-7hbuaVQrsV9cZS_zAl9Lm2QormSy1kjeZZNlMjWLkE7jCwTzJ_UJOQnD6P0ARmt7wKST-k5jRoi&amp;sig=AHIEtbTA6ypLiRfx-wsz4usY5dcwFbTVKA|work=monmouthshire.gov.uk|publisher=Monmouthshire County Council|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monmouthshire County Council – Weekly List of Determined Planning Applications|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:IahlagmBvAIJ:www.monmouthshire.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/1280/mcc_dc_determined_applications_decision_list_week_26_2008+Nelson+Rooms,+Glendower+Street,+Monmouthshire+County+Council&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiYUaeNIFAVwEK9qOmIAVfF0uDY95WfRnCm6HA2fm5ozRzUdIciRemW8v70ii3miZHCAwFoycXzVdXl3O5zuaolDx5rDkbUDjNz2lowBZASOSkMFuHgyEjnxC1f-OSQCRhy7PjA&amp;sig=AHIEtbSuD1F7V247NtKO16nlJeaSACUpKg|work=monmouthshire.gov.uk|publisher=Monmouthshire County Council|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the '''tomb of Alexander the Great''' is an enduring mystery. Shortly after [[Death of Alexander the Great|Alexander's death]] in [[Babylon]], the possession of his body became a subject of negotiations between [[Perdiccas]], [[Ptolemy I Soter]], and [[Seleucus I Nicator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saunders|2007|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Nicholas J. Saunders]], while Babylon was the "obvious site" for [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s resting place, some favored interring the ruler in the [[Argead]] burial at Aegae, modern [[Vergina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saunders|2007|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aegae was one of the two originally proposed resting places, according to Saunders, the other being [[Siwa Oasis]] and in 321 BC Perdiccas presumably chose Aegae.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saunders|2007|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body, however, was hijacked en route by Ptolemy I Soter. According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] and the contemporary [[Parian Chronicle]] records for the years 321–320 BC, Ptolemy initially buried Alexander in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. In the late 4th or early 3rd century BC, during the early [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], Alexander's body was transferred from Memphis to [[Alexandria]], where it was reburied.

The so-called [[Alexander Sarcophagus]], unrelated to Alexander's body and once thought to be the [[sarcophagus]] of [[Abdalonymus]], is now believed to be that of Mazacus, a Persian governor of Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  title = Alexander the Great at War: His Army - His Battles - His Enemies| publisher = Osprey Publishing| page=123| year = 2008 | isbn =1846033284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{further|Death of Alexander the Great}}
According to [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]] and [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], Alexander asked shortly before his death to be interred in the temple of [[Zeus Ammon]] at [[Siwah Oasis]].&lt;ref name ="o'connor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1097&amp;context=constructing|title=The Remains of Alexander the Great: The God, The King, The Symbol|publisher =''Constructing the Past''|volume=10|issue=1|author=Lauren O'Connor|year=2008|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander, who requested to be referred to and perceived as the son of Zeus Ammon, did not wish to be buried alongside his actual father at Aegae.&lt;ref name ="o'connor"/&gt; Alexander's body was placed in a coffin of "hammered gold", according to [[Diodorus]], which was "fitted to the body". The coffin is also mentioned by [[Strabo]] and Curtius Rufus (subsequently, in 89–90 BC the golden coffin was melted down and replaced with that of glass or crystal&lt;ref name="Saunders 2007 x"&gt;{{harvnb|Saunders|2007|p=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Alexander's wish to be interred in Siwa was not honored. In 321 BC, on its way back to [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], the funerary cart with Alexander's body was hijacked in [[Syria]] by one of Alexander's generals, [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. In late 322 or early 321 BC Ptolemy diverted the body to Egypt where it was interred in Memphis, the center of Alexander's government in Egypt. While Ptolemy was in possession of Alexander's body, Perdiccas and [[Eumenes]] had Alexander's armor, diadem and royal scepter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saunders|2007|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Plutarch]], who visited Alexandria, [[Python of Catana]] and Seleucus were sent to a [[serapeum]] to ask the oracle whether Alexander's body should be sent to Alexandria and the oracle answered positively.&lt;ref name ="Soma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greece.org/alexandria/tomb2/sources.htm|title=Ancient sources|publisher =Hellenic Electronic Center Portal|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 4th or early 3rd century BC Alexander's body was transferred from the Memphis tomb to [[Alexandria]] for reburial&lt;ref name ="Bianchi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/alexander/tomb.html|title=Hunting Alexander's Tomb|publisher =Archaeology.org|author=Robert S.

Later [[Ptolemy Philopator]] placed Alexander's body in Alexandria's communal mausoleum.&lt;ref name ="Bianchi"/&gt; The mausoleum was called the Soma or Sema, which means "body" in Greek. By 274 BC Alexander was already entombed in Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saunders|2007|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tomb of Alexander became the focal point for the [[Ptolemaic cult of Alexander the Great]].

In 48 BC Alexander's tomb was visited by [[Caesar]].&lt;ref name="Saunders 2007 x"/&gt; To finance her [[Final War of the Roman Republic|war against Octavian]], [[Cleopatra]] took gold from the tomb.&lt;ref name="archaeology"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/1089-alexander-the-great-macedon-alexandria-the-soma|title=Alexander the Great, King of Macedon|work=[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]| date=July 16, 2013| accessdate =August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the death of Cleopatra, Alexander's resting place was visited by [[Octavian]], who is said to have placed flowers on the tomb and a golden [[diadem]] upon Alexander's head.&lt;ref name ="Bianchi"/&gt; According to [[Suetonius]], Alexander's tomb was then partially looted by [[Caligula]], who reportedly removed his [[breastplate]]. In AD 199 Alexander's tomb was sealed up by [[Septimius Severus]] during his visit to Alexandria.&lt;ref name="Saunders 2007 x"/&gt; Later, in 215 some items from Alexander's tomb were relocated by [[Caracalla]].&lt;ref name="Saunders 2007 x"/&gt; According to chronicler [[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John of Antioch]], Caracalla removed Alexander's tunic, his ring, his belt with some other precious items and deposited them on the coffin.

When [[John Chrysostom]] visited Alexandria in AD 400, he asked to see Alexander’s tomb and remarked, "his tomb even his own people know not".&lt;ref name="archaeology"/&gt; Later authors, such as [[Ibn 'Abd al-Hakam]] (b. AD 803), [[Al-Masudi]] (b. AD 896) and [[Leo the African]] (b. 1494), report having seen Alexander's tomb.&lt;ref name ="Bianchi"/&gt; Leo the African, who visited Alexandria as a young man, wrote: "In the midst of the ruins of Alexandria, there still remains a small edifice, built like a chapel, worthy of notice on account of a remarkable tomb held in high honor by the Mahometans; in which sepulchre, they assert, is preserved the body of Alexander the Great... An immense crowd of strangers come thither, even from distant countries, for the sake of worshipping and doing homage to the tomb, on which they likewise frequently bestow considerable donations".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Madden|1851|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Sandys]], who visited Alexandria in 1611, was reportedly shown a sepulchre there, venerated as the resting place of Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Madden|1851|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptian [[Supreme Council for Antiquities]] has officially recognized over 140 search attempts for Alexander's tomb.&lt;ref name ="Bianchi"/&gt; [[Mahmoud el-Falaki]] (1815-1885), who compiled the map of ancient Alexandria, believed Alexander's tomb is in the center of Alexandria, at the intersection of the Via Canopica (modern Horreya Avenue) and the ancient street labeled R5.&lt;ref name ="tomb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greece.org/alexandria/tomb2/burial.htm|title=Where is Alexander Buried?|publisher =Hellenic Electronic Center|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then several other scholars such as [[Tasos Neroutsos]], [[Heinrich Kiepert]] and [[Ernst von Sieglin]] placed the tomb in the same area.&lt;ref name ="tomb"/&gt; In 1850 Ambroise Schilizzi announced the discovery of alleged Alexander's mummy and tomb inside the [[Nabi Daniel Mosque]] in Alexandria.&lt;ref name="Saunders 2007 xii"&gt;{{harvnb|Saunders|2007|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1879 a stone worker accidentally broke through the vaulted chamber inside the basement of that mosque. Some granite monuments with an angular summit were discerned there, but the entrance was then walled up and the stone worker was asked not to disclose the incident (the image on a Roman lamp in the [[National Museum, Poznań|National Museum of Poznań]] and others at the [[British Museum]] and the [[Hermitage Museum]] are interpreted by some scholars as showing Alexandria with the Soma Mausoleum pictured as a building with a pyramidal roof).&lt;ref name ="Soma"/&gt; In 1888 [[Heinrich Schliemann]] attempted to locate Alexander's tomb within the Nabi Daniel Mosque, but he was denied permission to excavate.&lt;ref name="Saunders 2007 xii"/&gt;

In 1993 Triandafyllos Papazois developed the theory that it is not [[Philip II of Macedon]] who is buried in the royal tomb II at Vergina, Greece, but it is Alexander the Great together with his wife Roxanne, while his son Alexander IV is buried in tomb III.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Alexander's tomb, p.187&lt;/ref&gt; Also based on the ancient historical sources he came to the conclusion that the breastplate, the shield, the helmet and the sword found in tomb II, belong to the armor of Alexander the Great.&lt;ref&gt;Τ.Παπαζώης, Ο Μέγας Αλέξανδρος με την οικογένεια του είναι θαμμένοι στους βασιλικούς τάφους ΙΙ και ΙΙΙ της Βεργίνας, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 Greek archaeologist Liana Souvaltzi announced she identified one alleged tomb in [[Siwah Oasis|Siwah]] with that of Alexander. The claim was put in doubt by the then-general secretary of the Greek Ministry of Culture, George Thomas, who said that it was unclear if the excavated structure is even a tomb.&lt;ref name="baltimore sun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-02-06/news/1995037011_1_tomb-was-built-alexander-tomb-excavations|title=No evidence seen of Alexander's tomb, Greeks say|publisher =''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''|date=February 6, 1995|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas and members of his team said that the style of the excavated object was not, as Souvaltzi contended, Macedonian, and that the fragments of tablets they were shown did not support any of the translations provided by Souvaltzi as proof of her finding.&lt;ref name="baltimore sun" /&gt;

According to one legend, the body lies in a [[crypt]] beneath an [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/110852.stm|title=Alexander's death riddle is 'solved' |publisher =[[BBC]]|accessdate=Aug 21, 2011|date=June 11, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 discovery of a large Alexander-era tomb at [[Kasta Tomb]] in [[Amphipolis]] in the region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Greece]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-29239529|title=Greeks captivated by Alexander-era tomb at Amphipolis|publisher=BBC|author=Giorgos Christides| date=22 September 2014| accessdate =2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; has once again invited speculation about Alexander's final resting place. Some have speculated that it was built for Alexander but never used due to [[Ptolemy I Soter]] having seized the funeral cortege. They suggest that the Roman Emperor [[Caracalla]], a great admirer of Alexander, may have had him re-interred in Amphipolis in the late second century AD. However, only future excavation at Amphipolis will reveal if there is any truth in the suggestion. In November 2014, a skeleton was discovered within the tomb,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yppo.gr/2/g22.jsp?obj_id=59112 Greek Government - Ministry of Culture and Sports - 12th November 2014 Press Release (in Greek)]&lt;/ref&gt; and its full examination is expected to last a few months in order to determine the characteristics of the deceased person in the effort to identify it.

In a 2011 episode of the [[National Geographic Channel]] television series ''[[Mystery Files]],''  Andrew Chugg claimed that Alexander the Great's body was stolen from Alexandria, Egypt, by Venetian merchants who believed it to be that of [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark the Evangelist]].

'''Ucanal''' is an archaeological site of the ancient [[Maya civilization]]. It is located in the [[Petén Department|Petén]] [[Departments of Guatemala|department]] of northern [[Guatemala]].

==Location==
Ucanal is located inside a bend of the [[Mopan River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peabody.harvard.edu/CMHI/site.php?site=Ucanal Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717164339/http://www.peabody.harvard.edu/CMHI/site.php?site=Ucanal |date=2012-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is accessed via the highway from [[Flores, El Petén|Flores]] to [[Melchor de Mencos]], and is near to the village of Tikalito. It is {{convert|51|mi|km}} to the south of [[Tikal]].

==History==
Ucanal was located in a strategic location near the source of the Belize River.

The ancient name of the Ucanal polity was K'anwitznal,&lt;ref&gt;Nikolai Grube, "Hieroglyphs" in ''Divine Kings of the Rain Forest'' (Könemann, 2000), 115f; 120&lt;/ref&gt; and one of its first rulers was [[Ajaw]] K'uk' or Lord [[Quetzal]]. The city had strong ties with [[Tikal]] and, in the 7th century AD, with [[Caracol]]. Ucanal was attacked by the ''Kalomte'' queen-regent, Wac' Chanil Ahau or Lady Six Sky of [[Naranjo]] (Saal) in September and December of 693; and on 1 February 695 Ucanal's lord Kinich Cab ("Shield-Jaguar") was captured by the ruler of Naranjo. Kinich Cab was held at Naranjo until 22 June 712; Ucanal was reduced to the status of vassal of that city.&lt;ref name="schele"&gt;Linda Schele, ''Forest of Kings'' (1991), 189&lt;/ref&gt;

In 800 CE, lord Hok K'awil of Caracol captured the lord of Ucanal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caracol.org/about/timeline.php Timeline] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604190756/http://www.caracol.org/about/timeline.php |date=2009-06-04 }}, Caracol excavation project, extracted 28 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next decades, a Maya-speaking, Nahuat/Maya mestizo people from the Putun filled the power vacuum in Ucanal. These people did not worship the Feathered Serpent Kukulcan.&lt;ref&gt;John Eric Sidney Thompson, ''Maya history and religion'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1990), 42-4&lt;/ref&gt; In 830 CE, lord Chan Ek' Hopet installed [[Wat'ul Chatel]] as his vassal over [[Seibal]], and commemorated it upon Stele 11 there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sharer, Robert J.   |authorlink=Robert Sharer|author2=Loa P. Traxler |year=2006 |title=The Ancient Maya |edition=6th (fully revised) |location=Stanford, CA |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |isbn=0-8047-4817-9 |oclc=57577446}}, p.523.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the rulers of Ucanal was [[Itzamnaaj Bahlam of Ucanal]].

==Site==
The site has evidence of two artificial irrigation channels one is {{convert|420|m|ft}} long and the other is {{convert|370|m|ft}} long, both channels are {{convert|7|m|ft}} wide. There are 114 structures in the main area and at least 150 residential groups. The protected area covers {{convert|1|sqmi|km2}} but does not include all the minor groups.  There are several temples and palaces, and 2 [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]]. Many of the stelae were destroyed by invaders from Naranjo (Saal). There are 22 stelae and 16 altars.

'''V-mail''', short for '''Victory Mail''', was a [[hybrid mail]] process used by the United States during the [[Second World War]] as the primary and secure method to correspond with soldiers stationed abroad. To reduce the cost of transferring an original letter through the [[Military mail|military postal system]], a V-mail letter would be censored, copied to film, and printed back to paper upon arrival at its destination. The V-mail process is based on the earlier British Airgraph process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Defence Postal &amp; Courier Services, London|year=1987|accessdate=2010-06-07|author=Edward Wells|title='Mailshot – A history of the Forces Postal Services' p. 107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation and function==
V-mail correspondence was on small [[letter sheet]]s, {{convert|17.8|by|23.2|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}}, that would go through [[Postal censorship|mail censors]] before being photographed and transported as thumbnail-sized image in negative [[microfilm]]. Upon arrival to their destination, the negatives would be printed. The final print was 60% of the original document's size, creating a sheet {{convert|10.7|by|13.2|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}}.
[[File:V Mail BB 60 Display.jpg|thumb|Explanation of V-Mail System in Display aboard [[USS Alabama (BB-60)|USS Alabama (BB 60)]], [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Alabama]]]]
According to the National Postal Museum, "V-mail ensured that thousands of tons of shipping space could be reserved for war materials. The 37 mail bags required to carry 150,000 one-page letters could be replaced by a single mail sack. The weight of that same amount of mail was reduced dramatically from 2,575 pounds to a mere 45." This saved considerable weight and bulk in a time in which both were hard to manage in a combat zone.

In addition to postal censorship, V-mail also deterred espionage communications by foiling the use of [[invisible ink]], [[microdot]]s, and [[microprinting]], none of which would be reproduced in a photocopy.

==British 'Airgraph'==

The airgraph was invented in the 1930s by the Eastman Kodak Company in conjunction with [[Imperial Airways]] (now British Airways) and [[Pan-American Airways]] as a means of reducing the weight and bulk of mail carried by air. The airgraph forms, upon which the letter was written, were photographed and then sent as negatives on rolls of microfilm. A [[General Post Office]] (GPO) poster of the time claimed that 1,600 letters on film weighed just 5oz, while 1,600 ordinary letters weighed 50&amp;nbsp;lbs. At their destination, the negatives were printed on photographic paper and delivered as airgraph letters through the normal [[Royal Engineers]] (Postal Section) - also known as the Army Postal Services (APS) - systems.

In 1940, the British Minister of Transport, Lieutenant Colonel [[John Moore-Brabazon, 1st Baron Brabazon of Tara]], put forward the idea that airgraphs be used to reduce both the bulk and weight of mail travelling between the Middle East Force (MEF) and the UK. The matter was referred to the APS and the GPO, who jointly investigated the possibility of using airgraphs. This eventually led to a service being instituted between England and Egypt in 1941 when 70,000 airgraphs were sent in the first batch and took three weeks to reach their destination.

Kodak had offices in Cairo that were capable of processing airgraph negatives, but it was not until the appropriate equipment arrived from America to their Cairo office that the APS was able to provide a return service to the UK.

In the theatres of war, the whole airgraph operation was coordinated by the APS. Completed airgraph forms were collected by the A/FPOs and forwarded to the Kodak processing plants, which were co-located with the Base APOs.

The use of the airgraph was not rationed and its postage was also set at three pence (3d). Although the airgraph proved to be immediately popular, its use was limited because of its size (approx; 2ins × 3ins) and lack of privacy, so when sufficient aircraft capacity became available, its use declined in favour of the air letter.

The airgraph service was later extended to: Canada (1941), East Africa (1941), Burma (1942), India (1942), South Africa (1942), Australia (1943), New Zealand (1943), Ceylon (1944), and Italy (1944).

== Historical antecedents ==

The U.S. military's V-mail was based on British Airgraphs, which were based on [[Eastman Kodak]]'s patent obtained from New York City banker George McCarthy. Prior to that, a similar system was deployed during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] which used [[carrier pigeon]]s to send primitive microfilm strips across German lines, developed from French optician [[René Dagron]]'s first patent granted for microfilm in 1859. Dagron's microfilm patent was additionally based on British scientist [[John Benjamin Dancer]], who created microfilm in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manchestermicroscopical.org.uk/danchom.html John Benjamin Dancer, 1812–1887: 19th Century Manchester Instrument Maker &amp; Inventor of Microphotography], Manchester Microscopical &amp; Natural History Society webpage. Retrieved October 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature ==

The narrator of ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' takes to going through the trash-basket outside his neighbour Holly Golightly's door:

:The same source made it evident that she received V-letters by the bale. They were always torn into strips like bookmarks. I used occasionally to pluck myself a bookmark in passing. ''Remember'' and ''miss you'' and ''rain'' and ''please write'' and ''damn'' and ''goddamn'' were the words that recurred most often on these slips; those, and ''lonesome'' and ''love''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Capote|first=Truman|date=1958|title=Breakfast at Tiffany's|location=London|publisher=Penguin|page=20|isbn=978-0-141-18279-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir William Boyd Dawkins'''  {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS|FSA|FGS}} (26 December 1837 – 15 January 1929) was a British [[geologist]] and [[archaeologist]]. He was a member of the [[Geological Survey of Great Britain]], Curator of the [[Manchester Museum]] and Professor of Geology at [[Owens College]], [[Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=DAWKINS, William Boyd|journal=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=456|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA456}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is noted for his research on [[fossils]] and the [[antiquity of man]]. He was involved in many projects including a tunnel under the [[Humber]], a [[Channel Tunnel]] attempt and the proving of coal under [[Kent]].

==Background==
[[File:William Boyd Dawkins.jpg|thumb|200px|William Boyd Dawkins as a young man]] 
Dawkins was born at [[Buttington]] Vicarage in [[Montgomeryshire]] on 26 December 1837. He attracted attention at age five by collecting fossils from the local colliery spoil heaps. Soon after, his family moved to [[Fleetwood]] in [[Lancashire]], where he attended [[Rossall School]]. He again attracted attention by adding fossils from the local [[boulder clay]] to his earlier collection. After leaving school, he attended [[Jesus College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Alumni Oxonienses: the Members of the University of Oxford, 1715-1886/Dawkins, William Boyd]]&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with a second in Classics and a first in Natural Sciences.

On leaving Oxford University in 1862, he joined the [[Geological Survey of Great Britain]] where he spent seven years working on the areas of Kent and the [[Thames]] Valley. In 1869, he was elected a member of the [[Geological Society]] and appointed Curator of the [[Manchester Museum]], a position he held until 1890. In 1870, he took a further appointment as a lecturer at [[Owens College]], Manchester. eventually becoming the first Professor of Geology in 1874.

Dawkins became involved with the [[Manchester Geological and Mining Society]] and was its President on three occasions: 1874–75, 1876–77 and 1886–87. He was also President of the [[Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society]] from 1885 to 1887 and again from 1900 to 1902. He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1867 and acted as President of the Anthropological Section of the [[British Association]] in 1882 and the Geological Section in 1888. He was President of the [[Cambrian Archaeological Association]] in 1911–12 and, covering the [[First World War]] years, from 1913–1919.  Dawkins was [[knight]]ed for "services to geology" in the [[1919 Birthday Honours]]. He died in 1929, aged 91.

==Archaeology==

Dawkins achieved many distinctions in the field of [[archaeology]]. In 1859 he moved to [[Somerset]] to study classics with the vicar of [[Wookey]]. On hearing of the discovery of bones by local workmen he led excavations in the area of the hyena den at [[Wookey Hole Caves]]. He also excavated [[Aveline's Hole]], expanding its entrance and naming it after his mentor [[William Talbot Aveline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Witcombe|first=Richard|title=Who was Aveline anyway?: Mendip's Cave Names Explained|year=2009|publisher=Wessex Cave Club|location=Priddy|edition=2nd|pages=10–11|isbn=978-0-9500433-6-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work led to the discovery of the first evidence for use by Palaeolithic man in the [[Caves of the Mendip Hills]].

He spent a great deal of time researching in [[Derbyshire]], especially at [[Creswell Crags]] and Windy Knoll near [[Castleton, Derbyshire|Castleton]]. At Windy Knoll (NGR SK126830), he proved the existence of exotic animals that lived in England prior to the [[ice ages]]. With Rooke Pennington and J. Tym, he discovered bones from [[bison]], [[cave hyena]], [[cave bear]] and a large cat, possibly a relative of the [[sabre tooth tiger]]. The bison bones were more recently dated at 37 300bp (OxA – 4579). Many of the finds are located in the museums of [[Buxton Museum and Art Gallery|Buxton]], Derbyshire and Manchester.

==Kent==
In 1882, following from his work with the Geological Survey, Dawkins was appointed as the official surveyor by the Channel Tunnel Committee. He made a geological survey of the English and French coasts along the [[Dover]] and [[Calais]] areas, however the project was abandoned due to lack of money.

In 1886, the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] Company approached Dawkins asking him if his Channel Tunnel work has shown any coal under Kent. The finding of coal under Kent would have given the company great financial benefits. Together with Henry Willett and the French geologist Pigou, Dawkins presented a paper in 1887 proving the existence of coal under the [[Cretaceous]] deposits of Kent.

==Philanthropy==
[[File:The Manchester Museum.jpg|thumb|The Manchester Museum]]
Dawkins was a fighter for workers' rights especially in the [[coal mining]] industry. He lobbied hard to get a better education system for miners similar to the ones established in Germany. He donated undisclosed amounts of money to this cause.

Among his other donations was one to the [[Manchester Museum]]. The museum wanted to build an extension and started an appeal. The appeal raised £1015 2s 9d, of which Dawkins donated £500. Later in life he fought for compensation for people whose homes had been affected by subsidence from the salt mines and workings near [[Northwich]], [[Cheshire]].

On his death in 1929, his widow Lady Boyd Dawkins presented his library of some 400 works to the town of Buxton, Derbyshire.  These books, together with other personal items such as a bronze bust, photographs and his Lyell and Prestwich medals, are housed at Buxton Museum and Art Gallery in the Boyd Dawkins Reference Room.

[[File:Wittgenstein rod.svg|thumb|right|200px|An asymmetric case produced by a long rod]]
'''Wittgenstein's rod''' is a geometry problem discussed by 20th century philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

==Description==
A [[Ray (geometry)|ray]] is drawn with its  origin 'A' on a circle, through an external point ''S'' and a point ''B'' is chosen at some constant distance from the starting end of the ray; what figure does ''B'' describe when all the initial points on the circle are considered? The answer depends on three parameters: the radius of the circle, the distance from the center to ''S'' and the length of the segment ''AB''. The shape described by ''B'' can be seen as a  'figure of eight' which in some cases degenerates to a single lobe looking like  an [[Inverse curve|invert]]ed [[cardioid]].

If ''B'' remains on the same side of ''S'' with respect to the center of the circle, instead of a ray one can consider just a [[Line segment|segment]] or the [[Rod (geometry)|rod]] 'AB'.

Wittgenstein sketched a mechanism and wrote:
{{blockquote|While the point A describes a circle, B describes a figure eight. Now we write this down as a proposition of kinematics.
When I work the mechanism its movement proves the proposition to me; as would a construction on paper.
The proposition corresponds e.g. to a picture of the mechanism with the paths of the points A and B drawn in. Thus it is in a certain respect a picture of that movement. It holds fast what the proof shows me. Or - what it persuades me of.}}
