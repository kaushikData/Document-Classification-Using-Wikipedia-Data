The '''209th 'Shaheen' (Falcon) Corps''' is a corps, or military district, of the [[Afghan National Army]].  Its headquarters, Camp Shaheen, is at [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], [[Balkh Province]].  Since 25 April 2017, it has been commanded by Brigadier General Amanullah Mobin.&lt;ref name="MoD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mod.gov.af/en/page/corps/corps-of-209-shaheen|title=209 Shaheen Corps|publisher=Ministry of Defense|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It works closely with the German-led [[Resolute Support Mission]] [[TAAC North]], and has 1st Brigade at Mazar-i-Sharif and, it appears, a Second Brigade forming at [[Kunduz]]. A [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] solicitation for Kunduz headquarters facilities for the Second Brigade was issued in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;FedBizOpps.gov, [https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=458c63fbfcbd7153893336cf7d4cac9d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1&amp;cck=1&amp;au=&amp;ck= 38—Y—Construction Services for the Second Battalion, 209th headqauters facilities, ANA Kunduz Installation Phase II, Kunduz, Afghanistan]. Retrieved August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The corps is supported by the Mazar-i-Sharif Regional Support Squadron of the [[Afghan Air Force|AAF]], equipped with eight helicopters: four transport to support the Corps' commando battalion, two attack, and two medical transport helicopters.&lt;ref name="longwarjournalhelo"&gt;[http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2009/02/afghan_national_army.php Afghan National Army Air Corps: February 2009 Update – The Long War Journal] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wQIhm23B?url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2009/02/afghan_national_army.php |date=February 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, as a response to the [[Battle of Kunduz]], reports came that a new division would be formed in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marty|first=Franz J.|date=10 February 2016|title=Isolated Outposts: Badakhshan sitrep|url=|journal=Jane's defence weekly (Vol 53, No. 6)|doi=|issn=0265-3818|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alikersantti''' ([[Undersergeant]] in Swedish) is the lowest [[Finland|Finnish]] non-commissioned officer military rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.puolustusvoimat.fi/wcm/0802b480406f9674bed9ff66f99672d5/YlPalvO.pdf?MOD=AJPERES |title=Palvelusohjesääntö'' (General Regulations, in Finnish) |access-date=2013-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106165935/http://www.puolustusvoimat.fi/wcm/0802b480406f9674bed9ff66f99672d5/YlPalvO.pdf?MOD=AJPERES |archive-date=2011-01-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alikersantti is one rank above a [[Korpraali]] ([[Lance-Corporal]]) and one below a [[Kersantti]] ([[Sergeant]]). A holder of this rank is typically a squad leader, assistant squad leader, gun section leader or a fighting vehicle commander. 

== Obtaining the rank ==
Conscripts are first given basic military training for 2 months. About 30% are selected for NCO training (''aliupseerikoulu'' or ''AUK''), which lasts 4 months. Most ''alikersantti''s are posted to companies for squad leader duty. This is the most common conscript leader rank. Additionally, in many specialist branches with a 12-month service the rank is given automatically and the ''alikersantti'' is not given a command, e.g. assistant mechanic (''apumekaanikko'') in the Air Force.

It is also the highest rank that can be given to a soldier that has not completed any NCO course.

The '''Austrian Archaeological Institute at Athens''' ({{lang-de|Österreichisches Archäologisches Institut (ÖAI) Athen}}; {{lang-el|Αυστριακό Αρχαιολογικό Ινστιτούτο Αθηνών}}) is one of the 17 [[List of Foreign Archaeological Institutes in Greece|foreign archaeological institutes]] operating in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. It is a branch of the Austrian Archaeological Institute based in Vienna.

Founded in 1898 by [[Otto Benndorf]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kandler|first1=Manfred|title=100 JAHRE ÖSTERREICHISCHES ARCHÄOLOGISCHES INSTITUT. 1898 - 1998|url=http://homepage.univie.ac.at/elisabeth.trinkl/forum/forum0399/10oai.htm|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the fifth oldest such institution in Greece. Its main role is to provide a basis for Austrian scholars active in Greece, and to facilitate Austrian-run archaeological projects in the country.

==Excavations==

The '''Battle of Feyiase''' was the decisive battle in the struggle that led to the [[Ashanti Empire]] replacing [[Denkyira]] as the dominant power among the [[Twi]]-speaking [[Akan people|Akan]] peoples.

Prior to this battle the Denkyirahene [[Ntim Gyakari]] thought he was doing well in the war, having driven the [[Ashanti Empire|Ashanti]] (Asante) forces from Adunku, Abuontem and Aputuogya.  However this was all part of [[Osei Tutu]]'s plan to ambush the Denkyira troops at Feyiase.

At Feyiase the full force of the Asante war machine fell upon the Denkyiran army, and they were routed.  [[Ntim Gyakari]] was killed by the people of Adunku from Asante Feyiase, and Denkyira's [[hegemony]] was broken at Feyiase Akoyem. Feyiase Akoyem is now a part of [[Bosomtwe District]] which lies between Aputuogya and Esereso where the war ended&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Feyiase-Akoyem-gets-new-police-station-290171&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{Campaignbox Conquest of Italy by Theodoric the Great}}

The '''Battle of the Isonzo''', the '''Battle of the Aesontius''', or the '''Battle of the Isontius''' is the name given to the battle fought on August 28, 489 on the banks of the Isontius River, not far away from [[Aquileia]]. This river is now known as the [[Isonzo]] in [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Soča]] in [[Slovene language|Slovene]]. This battle should not be confused with the 12 [[Battles of the Isonzo]] during [[World War I]].

[[Theoderic the Great]], king of the [[Ostrogoths]], in 489 opened his first campaign against [[Odoacer]] to wrest [[Italy]] from him. On 28 August, the two armies met on the banks of the Isontius. Theoderic defeated Odoacer, who retreated. A [[Battle of Verona (489)|second battle]] was fought at [[Verona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xsQxcJvaLjAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=History+of+the+Goths#v=onepage&amp;q=Bassianae%20Dengizich&amp;f=false |title=History of the Goths |publisher=University of California Press |date=13 February 1990 |accessdate=5 April 2012|isbn=9780520069831 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

In 476, the barbarian warlord Odoacer founded the Kingdom of Italy as the first King of Italy, initiating a new era over Roman lands. Unlike most of the last emperors, he acted decisively. At the beginning of his reign he "slew Count Bracila at Ravenna that he might inspire a fear of himself among the Romans." He took many military actions to strengthen his control over Italy and its neighboring areas. He achieved a solid diplomatic coup by inducing the Vandal king Gaiseric to cede to him Sicily. Noting that "Odovacar seized power in August of 476, Gaiseric died in January 477, and the sea usually became closed to navigation around the beginning of November", F.M. Clover dates this cession to September or October 476. When Julius Nepos was murdered by two of his retainers in his country house near Salona (May 480), Odoacer assumed the duty of pursuing and executing the assassins, and at the same time established his own rule in Dalmatia.
 
As Odoacer's position improved, Zeno, the Eastern Emperor, increasingly saw him as a rival. According to John of Antioch, Odoacer exchanged messages with Illus, who had been in revolt against Zeno since 484. Thus Zeno sought to destroy Odoacer and promised Theoderic the Great and his Ostrogoths the Italian peninsula if they were to defeat and remove Odoacer. Theoderic had his own reasons to agree to this offer, as he had enough experience to know (or at least suspect) that Zeno would not, in the long term, tolerate his independent power. When Theoderic rebelled in 485, he had in mind Zeno's treatment of Armatus. Armatus defected from Basilicus to Zeno in 476, and was made senior imperial general for life. Within a year, Zeno had him assassinated.

== Battle and Aftermath ==

In 489, Theoderic led the Ostrogoths across the Julian Alps and into Italy. On 28 August, Odoacer met him at the Isonzo, only to be defeated. He withdrew to Verona, reaching its outskirts on 27 September, where he immediately set up a fortified camp. Theoderic followed him and three days later defeated him again. While Odoacer took refuge in Ravenna, Theoderic continued across Italy to Mediolanum, where the majority of Odoacer's army, including his chief general Tufa, surrendered to the Ostrogothic king. Theoderic had no reason to doubt Tufa's loyalty and dispatched his new general to Ravenna with a band of elite soldiers, "but Tufa changed sides, the Gothic elite force entrusted to his command was destroyed, and Theoderic suffered his first serious defeat on Italian soil.” Theoderic recoiled by seeking safety in Ticinum. Odoacer emerged from Ravenna and started to besiege his rival. While both were fully engaged, the Burgundians seized the opportunity to plunder and devastated Liguria. Many Romans were taken into captivity, and did not regain their freedom until Theoderic ransomed them three years later.

The wooden doors are carved with a [[girih]] pattern of strapwork.

The '''Ben Youssef Madrasa''' was an [[Islam]]ic [[college]] in [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]],  named after the [[Almoravid]] [[sultan]] [[Ali ibn Yusuf]] (reigned 1106–1142), who expanded the city and its influence considerably. It is the largest madrasa in all of Morocco.

The college was founded during the period of the [[Marinid]] (14th century) by the [[Marinid]] sultan [[Abu Al-Hasan Ali ibn Othman|Abu al-Hassan]] and allied to the neighbouring [[Ben Youssef Mosque]]. The building of the [[madrasa]] was re-constructed by the [[Saadi Dynasty|Saadian]] Sultan [[Abdallah al-Ghalib]] (1557–1574).&lt;ref name=Raezer&gt;{{Cite book |title=Morocco Revealed: Fez, Marrakech, Meknes and Rabat |last=Raezer |first=David |publisher=Approach Guides|year=2015 |isbn=1936614472 |pages=1931–2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1565 the works ordered by [[Abdallah al-Ghalib]] were finished, as confirmed by the inscription in the prayer room. Its 130 student dormitory cells cluster around a courtyard richly carved in [[cedrus|cedar]], [[marble]] and [[stucco]]. The carvings contain no representation of humans or animals as required by [[Islam]], and consist entirely of inscriptions and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] such as star and petal designs in [[zellige]] tilework.&lt;ref name=Broug2008&gt;{{cite book |author=Broug, Eric |title=Islamic Geometric Patterns |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-500-28721-7 |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; This madrasa was one of the largest theological colleges in [[North Africa]] and may have housed as many as 900 students. One of its best known teachers was [[Mohammed al-Ifrani]] (1670-1745).&lt;ref name=Raezer /&gt;

Closed down in 1960, the building was refurbished and reopened to the public as an historical site in 1982.

There is a small but recognizable community of '''Brazilians in Angola''' consisting mainly of immigrants and expatriates from [[Brazil]]. There are an estimated 5,000 Brazilians registered in Angola, mainly working for construction, mining and agribusiness companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/08/17/angola-brazil-a-culture-shock-divide/: Angola, Brazil - A culture shock divide]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
With the formation of the CPLP ([[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]]) in 1996 there has been an increase of Brazilian immigrants to Angola.  Many of these are said to be [[white Brazilian|white Brazilians]] looking for economic investments in the largely undeveloped country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mixedindifferentshades.net/africa/angola.html|title=mixedindifferentshades.net|website=www.mixedindifferentshades.net|language=en|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the "Association of Brazilian Companies in Angola", the presence of Brazilian companies in Angola has expanded on a par with the increase in trade. The number of Brazilian companies in Angola has increased by 70 percent over the last few years since 2002. The firms are mainly involved in public works, sales of construction materials, project design, real estate and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40040|title=Inter Press Service {{!}} News and Views from the Global South|website=ipsnews.net|access-date=2017-07-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904014903/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40040|archivedate=2008-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazilians are thus beginning to flock to a country which, in spite of the historical and linguistic links, was virtually an unknown quantity until just over a decade ago. The 5,000 Brazilians registered in Angola live and work in the provinces of [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]], [[Lunda Norte]] and [[Malanje]] as well as in the capital, [[Luanda]].

'''Detachment Brandenstein''' was a unit commanded by German [[Baron]] [[Otto von Brandenstein]]. The 3,000 man unit which fought in the [[Finnish Civil War]] by landing at [[Loviisa]] April 7, 1918. Its assigned mission was to cut the Reds' railway connections by attacking to the East, thus cutting the railway between [[Helsinki]] and [[Viipuri]]. The major operation for Detachment Brandenstein was the [[Battle of Lahti]] in 19 April – 1 May.

Later the unit was attached to the [[Baltic Sea Division]].

The second version of the music video also comes with karaoke-style lyrics displayed at the bottom on the video.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2309">An '''emporium''' (plural: '''emporia''') was one of the trading settlements that emerged in [[Northwestern Europe]] in the 6th to the 7th centuries and persisted into the 9th century. Also known in English as '''[[-wich town|wics]]''', they were characterised by their peripheral locations, usually on the shore at the edge of a kingdom, their lack of infrastructure (containing no churches) and their short-lived nature. By 1000, the emporia had been replaced by the revival of European towns. Examples include [[Dorestad]], [[Quentovic]], Gipeswic, Hamwic, and Lundenwic (for which see [[Anglo-Saxon London]]). Their role in the economic history of [[Western Europe]] remains debated. Their most famous exponent has been the British archaeologist [[Richard Hodges (archaeologist)|Richard Hodges]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4435">{{Expand French|Loi relative à l'enseignement supérieur et à la recherche|date=July 2015}}

The '''Law on Higher Education and Research''' of July 22, 2013 replaced laws promulgated by the previous French government in 2006 and 2007 (for example the law on [[Liberties and Responsibilities of Universities]]) regarding the organization and autonomy of universities and other research and higher education institutions in France.

During the 2012 French presidential election, [[François Hollande]] promised to review and improve conditions for undergraduate and graduate education and research in French universities. Shortly after the election, [[Geneviève Fioraso]], minister for higher education and research, launched an assessment process led by an independent committee in dialogue with the university community. The committee presented a report on December 17, 2012 containing 135 recommendations. Some of the proposals received criticism, but these formed the basis for the new law presented to the [[National Assembly (France)]] in March 2013, and adopted into law July 22, 2013. Other than a dispute over the introduction of English into university courses there was little public debate.

== Contents of the Law ==
The first title of the new law concerned general principles such as teaching in the French language,&lt;ref group="law"&gt;Articles L121-3 of the code de l’Éducation, modified by article 2 of the law on higher education and research&lt;/ref&gt; or the use of [[Free software]]. Ministers in charge of Higher Education and Research would be responsible for 5-year strategic national plans.

The law describes national limits on general professional degrees and minimal percentages on professional graduates and technological graduates. Students have a right to access more selective university programs if they have sufficiently high grades on their [[baccalauréat]] (high school graduation exam).

=== Geographic coordination ===

The law provides that “coordination is organized by only one establishment of higher education for a given territory [academic or interacademic]".

Every institution of higher education needed to plan for the following to establish this coordination:
* merging with one or more other institutions
* participating in an [[association of universities and higher education institutions]],
* associating in another form of [[Établissement public à caractère scientifique, culturel et professionnel|public scientific, cultural or professional establishment (EPSCP)]].&lt;ref group="law"&gt;Articles L718-2 and L718-3 of the code de l’Éducation, created by article 62 of the law on higher education and research&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association of universities and higher education institutions (communauté d’universités et établissements) is a new type of EPSCP created by this law; at the same time, the  [[Pôle de recherche et d'enseignement supérieur|pôles de recherche et d'enseignement supérieur]] (PRES), the [[Réseau thématique de recherche avancée|réseaux thématiques de recherche avancée]] (RTRA) and the [[Établissement public de coopération scientifique|établissements publics de coopération scientifique]] (EPCS), created by the 2006 law on research coordination are discontinued.&lt;ref group="law"&gt;Article 66 of the law on higher education and research&lt;/ref&gt;

Now there are [[Groups of universities and institutions|Communities of universities and institutions]] (COMUE).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57846">This is a '''list of [[English language]] words borrowed from [[indigenous languages of the Americas]]''', either directly or through intermediate European languages such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[French language|French]]. † indicates a link to a definition of the word. It does not cover names of ethnic groups or place names derived from indigenous languages.

Most words of Native American/First Nations language origin are the [[common name]]s for indigenous flora and fauna, or describe items of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] or [[First Nations]] life and culture. Some few are names applied in honor of Native Americans or First Nations peoples or due to a vague similarity to the original object of the word. For instance, [[Sequoioideae|sequoias]] are named in honor of the Cherokee leader [[Sequoyah]], who lived 2,000 miles east of that tree's range while the [[kinkajou]] of South America was given a name from an unrelated North American animal 2,000 miles to the north.

==Words from Algonquian languages==
{{Wiktionary category|type=with [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]] origins|category=Algonquian derivations}}

Since Native Americans and First Nations peoples speaking a language of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian group]] were generally the first to meet English explorers and settlers along the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]], many words from these languages made their way into English.

In addition, a great number of place names in [[North America]] are of Algonquian origin, for example: '''Mississippi''' (cf. [[Illinois language|Illinois]] ''mihsisiipiiwi'' and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] ''misiziibi'', "great river," referring to the [[Mississippi River]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myaamiaproject.org/project/map.php |title=Historical Landscapes of the Miami |work=Myaamia Project |author=Klak, Thomas |accessdate=2007-03-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928031958/http://www.myaamiaproject.org/project/map.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDMO"&gt;Nichols, John, and Earl Nyholm. 1995.

In addition, a number of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] groups are known better by their Algonquian [[exonym]]s, rather than by their [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]], such as the [[Eskimo]] (see below), [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] (perhaps from [[Potawatomi language|Potawatomi]] ''winpyéko'', "(people of the) dirty water"),&lt;ref name="Cthreeninenine"&gt;Campbell (1997:399)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sioux]] (ultimately from [[Anishinaabe language|Ottawa]] ''naadowesiwag''),&lt;ref name="Cthreeninenine" /&gt; [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]] ([[Anishinaabe language|Ojibwe]] ''asiniibwaan'', "stone Sioux")&lt;ref name="CDMO" /&gt; and [[Chipewyan]] ([[Cree language|Cree]] ''čīpwayān'', "(those who have) pointed skins or hides").&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1997:395)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most words of Nahuatl origin end in a form of the Nahuatl "[[Classical Nahuatl grammar#Nouns|absolutive suffix]]" (''-tl'', ''-tli'', or ''-li'', or the Spanish adaptation ''-te''), which marked unpossessed nouns.

Some researchers have recently proposed that the ''chocol-'' element was originally ''chicol-'', and referred to a special wooden stick used to prepare chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;Dakin, Karen and Wichmann, Søren (2000).

The '''Luxembourg Confederation of Christian Trade Unions''' ({{lang-lb|Lëtzebuerger Chrëschtleche Gewerkschaftsbond}}, {{lang-fr|Confédération Luxembourgeoise des Syndicats Chrétiens}}), abbreviated to '''LCGB''', is a [[Luxembourg]]ish [[trade union]] confederation.  As the LCGB abides by the principles of Christian social teachings. This is also illustrated by the trade union's motto: Man at the Center of our action.

The '''National Human Development Reports''' (NHDR) take the Global Human Development Report approach to the national level and are prepared and owned by national teams. More than 540 national and sub-national HDRs have been produced so far by 135 countries, in addition to 31 regional reports. 

They have introduced the human development concept into national policy dialogue — not only through human development indicators and policy recommendations, but also through the country-led and country-owned process of consultation, research and report writing. Data that is often not published elsewhere - such as statistics disaggregated by geographic location, ethnic group or along rural/urban lines - help pinpoint development gaps, measure progress and flag early warning signs of possible conflict. 

As advocacy tools designed to appeal to a wide audience, the reports also spur lively public debates and mobilize support for action and change. They have helped to articulate people’s perceptions and priorities, as well as serve as a resource of alternate policy opinion for development planning.

'''Saint Mary's Redoubt''' ({{lang-mt|Ridott ta' Santa Marija}}), also known as '''Migart Redoubt''' ({{lang-mt|Ridott ta' Migart}}), was a [[redoubt]] on the island of [[Comino]] in [[Malta]]. It was built by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]] in 1716 or 1761 (sources vary) as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farrugia Randon|first1=Stanley|title=Heritage Saved – Din l-Art Ħelwa – 1965–2015|date=2015|publisher=Miller Distributors Ltd.|location=[[Luqa]]|isbn=9789995752132|pages=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The redoubt was located on the northern coast of Comino, far away from the island's other defences of [[Saint Mary's Tower]] and [[Saint Mary's Battery]]. It was demolished and no traces of it can be seen today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Comino|url=http://www.unitedcominoferries.com/comino.html|website=United Comino Ferries|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gozo: The Isle of Joy on Stamps|date=November 2011|publisher=Gozo Philatelic Society|location=[[Victoria, Gozo|Victoria]]|page=20|url=https://www.stamps-gozo.org/pdf/isle.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Taranaki Basin lies on the West coast of the North Island of New Zealand in the [[Taranaki Region]], and is approximately 400&amp;nbsp;km west of the current Pacific-Australian plate boundary.&lt;ref name=Armstrong /&gt; It covers approximately 100,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and contains up to 9&amp;nbsp;km in sediment.&lt;ref name=Webster /&gt; The basin is divided into two main components, the Western Platform and Eastern Mobile Belt, formerly known as the Taranaki Graben.&lt;ref name=Armstrong&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=P.A.|last2=Chapman|first2=D.S.|title=Combining Tectonics and Thermal Fields in the Taranaki Basin, New Zealand|journal=Geothermics in Basin Analysis|date=1999|pages=151–176|doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-4751-8_8|series=Computer Applications in the Earth Sciences|isbn=978-1-4613-7154-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palmer|first1=Julie|last2=Geoff|first2=Bulte|title=Taranaki Basin, New Zealand|journal=Active Margin Basins|date=1988|pages=269–290|doi=10.1306/M52531C9|doi-broken-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Western Platform is a relatively undeformed, stable block compared to the Eastern Mobile Belt.  While it underwent block faulting throughout the Late Cretaceous to the Eocene, it has been stable since. This section of the basin contains between 2000 and 5000m of sediment, dating from the Late Cretaceous to present. The Western Platform is separated from the Eastern Mobile Belt on the East by the Cape Egmont fault zone, a northwest trending fault zone consisting of multiple subparallel reverse and normal faults.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt; The Eastern Mobile Belt consists of multiple grabens and contains multiple compressional features, including overthrusts, reverse faults, and inversion structures. The Eastern Mobile Belt extends from this fault zone to the north-south trending Taranaki fault zone, which is adjacent to the a large upthrust basement block that divides the Taranaki Basin from the later-formed, eastward Wanganui Basin.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt;

;Nature
The [[Blue whale]], [[Southern right whale]] and the critically endangered [[Maui's dolphin]] are living beings in the sea in Taranaki Basin, or live near the coast of Taranaki. For the Blue whale it is a breeding ground.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/press-release/rainbow-warrior-confronts-taranaki-oil-rigs/ Rainbow Warrior confronts Taranaki oil rigs’’], [[Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand|Greenpeace New Zealand]], October 2, 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Tectonic Evolution==

===Basement Structure===
Pre-rift rocks in the Taranaki Basin are typically considered [[Basement (geology)|basement rocks]].&lt;ref name=Kroeger /&gt; The Taranaki basement is extremely heterogeneous, with metasediments and granites representing the original Gondwana Craton, and granitoids, volcanic and volcano-sedimentary rocks, and accretionary complexes representing later accretionary terrains and plutons.&lt;ref name=Muir&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muir|first1=R.J|last2=Bradshaw|first2=J.D.|last3=Weaver|first3=S.D.|last4=Laird|first4=M.G.|title=The influence of basement structure on the evolution of the Taranaki Basin, New Zealand|journal=Journal of the Geological Society|date=2000|volume=157|issue=6|pages=1179–1185|doi=10.1144/jgs.157.6.1179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rifting===
Formation of the Taranaki Basin initiated in the Late Cretaceous, due to the separation of Australia and [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]] during the breakup of [[Gondwana]]land. This breakup caused the formation of the [[Tasman Sea]], along with multiple extensional basins on the New Zealand subcontinent, including an intra-plate rift that formed the Taranaki Rift, which would develop into the Taranaki Basin.&lt;ref name=Baur /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kroeger&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kroeger|first1=K.F.|last2=Funnell|first2=R.H.|last3=Nicol|first3=A.|last4=Fohrmann|first4=M.|last5=Bland|first5=K.J.|last6=King|first6=P.R.|title=3D crustal-scale heat-flow regimes at a developing active margin (Taranaki Basin, New Zealand)|journal=Tectonophysics|date=2013|volume=591|pages=175–193|doi=10.1016/j.tecto.2012.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thrasher&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thrasher|first1=G.P.|title=Last Cretaceous Geology of Taranaki Basin, New Zealand|journal=Victoria University of Wellington: Thesis|date=1992|hdl=10063/525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Syn-rift sediments were deposited within rift controlled grabens across the basin, and are separated from the basement rock by a regional unconformity.&lt;ref name=Kroeger /&gt; These sedimentary layers contain faulting that is indicative of extension during deposition.&lt;ref name=Baur /&gt; They include sequencing from non-marine conglomerates to sand, silt, and then coals.&lt;ref name=Webster&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Mark|last2=O'Conner|first2=Stephen|last3=Pindar|first3=Bitrus|last4=Swarbrick|first4=Richard|title=Overpressures in the Taranaki Basin: Distribution, causes, and implications for exploration|journal=American Association of Petroleum Geologists|date=2011|volume=95|issue=3|pages=339–379|doi=10.1306/06301009149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drift===
After the end of extension in the Late Cretaceous, the Taranaki Basin became a passive margin setting, with drift resulting in marine transgression. Subsidence of the basin was slow enough to allow for the massive accumulation of sediment during the Paleocene and Eocene. These Paleocene and Eocene sandstones contain the majority of the petroleum reserves found within the basin.&lt;ref name=Higgs /&gt; During drift, a decline in sediment deposition occurred, with a thinning of layers from the Cretaceous to the Eocene. The sediments in this sequence lead from coastal plain deposits, to shallow marine sands, to shelf sediments.&lt;ref name=Baur /&gt;

==Stratigraphy==

===Pakawau Group===

The Pakawau group contains the oldest sediment within the Taranaki Basin, deposited between the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene. It includes the Rakopi Formation (85-75 Ma) and the North Cape Formation (75-65 Ma). Rocks within this group include fluvial sandstones and marine, transgressive sandstones.&lt;ref name=Ministry /&gt; In some areas within the basin, this group is more than 2000 m thick. It overlies the mostly igneous and metasedimentary basement.&lt;ref name="Palmer Strat"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palmer|first1=Julie|title=Pre-Miocene lithostratigraphy of Taranaki Basin, New Zealand|journal=New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics|date=1985|volume=28|issue=2|pages=197–216|doi=10.1080/00288306.1985.10422220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kapuni Group===

The Kapuni group contains multiple formations that span the Paleocene and Eocene. These formations are, in ascending order, the Farewell Formation, Kaimiro Formation, Mangahewa Formation, and McKee Formation.&lt;ref name="Palmer Strat" /&gt;

The '''Farewell Formation''' (65-55 Ma) contains mostly fluvial sandstone.
The '''Kaimiro Formation''' (55-45 Ma) contains mostly poor to moderately sorted alluvial and coastal plain sandstones with some inter-bedded micaceous and carbonaceous mudstones and siltstones. This formation is not fossiliferous.
The '''Mangahewa Formation''' (45-34 Ma) consists mostly of sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and bitumonous coal. This formation has good reservoir sandstones. 
The '''McKee Formation''' (38-33 Ma) is easily recognizable by its coarse-grained, well sorted sandstones. Small clasts of mudstones and coal can be found throughout this formation.&lt;ref name=Ministry /&gt;&lt;ref name="Palmer Strat" /&gt;

===Tikorangi Limestone===

The Tikorangi Limestone (33-23 Ma) is composed of mostly sandy, deep-water limestone along with calcareous mudstone interbedded with calcareous sandstone.&lt;ref name="Palmer Strat" /&gt;&lt;ref name=GNS&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fohrmann|first1=M.|last2=et. al.|title=Seismic reflection character, mapping and tectono-stratigraphic history of the Kupe area (4D Taranaki Project), south-eastern Taranaki Basin|journal=GNS Science Report|date=2012|url=http://www.gns.cri.nz/static/pubs/2012/SR%202012-36%20Kupe%20Mapping%20Report%20final.pdf|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It forms a conformable contact with an 8m thick layer of glauconitic sandstone, '''The Matapo Sandstone Member''', which lies above the formation.&lt;ref name="Palmer Strat" /&gt;

===Mahoenui Group===

The Mahoenui Group consists of calcareous mudstones, with thinly interbedded sandstones, siltstones, and limestones. Sediment in this group was deposited during the Late Oligocene and the Early Miocene.&lt;ref name=Collen /&gt;

===Mokau Group===

The Mokau Group is composed of shoreface sandstones with some interbedded siltstones. Layers of fluvial conglomerate and coal can be found as well.&lt;ref name=Kamp1&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kamp|first1=P.J.|last2=Vonk|first2=A.J.|last3=Nelson|first3=Campbell|chapter=Field Trip 5: Stratigraphic Architecture and Sedimentology of King Country and Eastern Taranaki Basins |title=Field Trip Guides, Geological Society of New Zealand, New Zealand Geophysical Society, 26th Annual Geothermal Workshop, Joint Geosciences Conference |location=New Zealand |publisher=Geological Society of New Zealand|date=2004|pages=43–86|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sediment in this group represents deposition in the Early Miocene.&lt;ref name="Palmer Strat" /&gt;

===Wai-iti Group===

The '''Mohakatino Formation''' (~17-13 Ma) is composed of silty mudstones, with andesitic, volcaniclastic sandstones.&lt;ref name=Collen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kamp1 /&gt;
The '''Mt Messenger Formation''' (11-9 Ma), also known as the Waikiekie Formation, is a massive sandstone unit.&lt;ref name=Collen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collen|first1=J.D.|last2=Neall|first2=V.E.|last3=Johnston|first3=J.H.|title=Sandstone xenoliths in the Pungarehu Formation, Western Taranaki, New Zealand: implications for petroleum exploration|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand|date=1985|volume=15|issue=2|pages=201–212|doi=10.1080/03036758.1985.10416844}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The '''Urenui Formation''' (9-5 Ma) is a silty mudstone that contains occasional conglomerates.&lt;ref name="Palmer Strat" /&gt;

===Matemateaonga Formation===

The Matemateaonga Formation (7-5 Ma) consists of shellbeds, siltstones and sandstones with interbedded conglomerate. This formation represents deposition during the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene.&lt;ref name=Collen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vonk&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vonk|first1=A.J.|last2=Kamp|first2=P.J.|title=Late Miocene-Early Pliocene Matemateaonga Formation in Eastern Taranaki Peninsula: A New 1:50,000 Geologic Map  and Stratigraphic Framework|journal=New Zealand Petroleum Conference Proceedings|date=2004|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent Deposits===
Andesitic volcanism began within the basin in the Miocene, and has continued until the present day.

==Hydrocarbons==
The majority of New Zealand's petroleum production has been within the Taranaki Basin. Over 1.8 billion barrels of [[Barrel of oil equivalent|BOE]] have been discovered, of which 70% is gas.&lt;ref name=Webster /&gt; More than 400 wells have been drilled throughout the basin,&lt;ref name=Kroeger /&gt; in about 20 fields.&lt;ref name=Ministry /&gt;  A wide variety of petroleum play types, mostly structural, can be seen throughout the basin due to its complex history. The main trap styles found within the basin are fault-dependent closures, inversion anticlines, and overthrusts.&lt;ref name=Webster /&gt;

;Source Rocks

The majority of oil produced from the Taranaki basement are sourced from coals and marine shales from the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene.&lt;ref name=Ministry /&gt;

On occasion, [[Beetlejuice (entertainer)|Beetlejuice]], [[Gary the Conqueror]], [[The Wack Pack#Bigfoot (Mark Shaw, Jr.)|Bigfoot]] and [[The Iron Sheik]] participate. A recurring joke is Bob Levy eating [[blue cheese]] or [[whipped cream]] out of a woman's rear end. It also featured up and coming stand up comedians like John Tole &amp; Brad Thacker who toured &amp; hosted the shows.

Howard Stern's sidekick, [[Artie Lange]], referred to the group as the "Hack Pack" in July, 2007. The name, which has since been unofficially adopted by the troup, caused controversy when Shuli confronted Artie on air and told him how offended he was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jason|last=Kaplan|author2=Michael Dempster |title=The Rundown - The "Hack Pack" Attacks a Fat Man|date=2007-07-25|publisher=HowardStern.com|url=http://howardstern.com/rundown.hs?month=July&amp;day=25&amp;year=2007 |accessdate=2007-09-04|quote=Shuli came in to complain about Artie calling the Killers of Comedy "The Hack Pack" on the RawDog comedy channel.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the show, Artie had remarked about John, Ralph, and himself becoming the new "[[Rat Pack]]" in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Vegas]], noting that "Sad Pack" was a more apt description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jason|last=Kaplan|author2=Michael Dempster |title=The Rundown - The Sad Pack Rides Again|date=2007-07-25 |publisher=HowardStern.com

The '''Sacred Heart Cathedral'''&lt;ref&gt;Худяков В. В. В цветущих акациях город… Бендеры: люди, события, факты. — Бендеры: Полиграфист, 1999. — С. 31—32. — {{ISBN|5-88568-090-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ro|Catedrala Schimbarea la Față din Tighina}}) ({{lang-ru|Преображенский кафедральный собор}}) is the name given to a Russian Orthodox church in the Diocese of Tiraspol and Dubossary, [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]], a town controlled by [[Transnistria]], de facto independent territory of [[Moldova]].

Its history dates back to 1814 when working on the expansion of local strength. It was built between 1815 and 1820 to constitute a symbol of liberation from Ottoman Turkish rule place.

It was consecrated on December 5, 1819. From 1918 to 1944 (except for the Soviet period, from 1940 to 1941) the parish church belonged to the Romanian Orthodox Church.

Since 1948 the cathedral was placed under state protection as a monument of architecture of the early nineteenth century.

The '''United Nations Secretariat''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|le Secrétariat des Nations unies}}) is one of the six major organs of the United Nations, with the others being (a) the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]]; (b) the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]; (c) the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]]; (d) the defunct [[United Nations Trusteeship Council|Trusteeship Council]]; and (e) the [[International Court of Justice]].&lt;ref name="Organs of the UN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Main Organs|url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/about-un/main-organs/index.html|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN Secretariat"&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Secretariat|url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/about-un/secretariat/index.html|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretariat is the United Nations' executive arm. The Secretariat has an important role in setting the agenda for the UN's deliberative and decision making bodies of the UN (the General Assembly, Economic and Social Council, and Security Council), and the implementation of the decision of these bodies. The [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]], who is appointed by the General Assembly, is the head of the secretariat.&lt;ref name="UN Secretariat"/&gt;

The mandate of the secretariat is a wide one. [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], the United Nations' second Secretary-General, described its power as follows: "The United Nations is what member nations made it, but within the limits set by government action and government cooperation, much depends on what the Secretariat makes it... [it] has creative capacity. It can introduce new ideas. It can, in proper forms, take initiatives. It can put before member governments findings which will influence their actions".&lt;ref name="Hammarskjöld1968"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dag Hammarskjöld|title=Hammarskjöld: The Political Man|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VuxBAAAAIAAJ|year=1968|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Department of Political Affairs]], which has a role analogous to a [[ministry of foreign affairs]], is a part of the secretariat. So is the department of [[United Nations peacekeeping|United Nations Peace Keeping Operations]]. The secretariat is the main source of economic and political analysis for the General Assembly and Security Council; it administers operations initiated by UN's deliberative organs, operates political missions, prepares assessments that precede peacekeeping operations, appoints the heads of peacekeeping operations, conducts surveys and research, communicates with non-state actors such as media and non-government organizations, and is responsible for publishing all of the treaties and international agreements.&lt;ref name="UN Secretariat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul Novosad"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Novosad|first1=Paul|last2=Werker|first2=Eric|title=Who Runs the International System?

== Staffing ==
{{Main article|United Nations Staff Selection System}}
The Secretariat has 44,000 international civil servants. Eligibility for civil service is based on a UN-administered examination offered worldwide, in addition to a competitive application process.&lt;ref name=Secretariat&gt;{{cite web|title=Secretariat – United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/en/mainbodies/secretariat/|publisher=The United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualifications for membership include "the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity",&lt;ref name="Charter of the United Nations"&gt;{{cite book|title=Charter of the United Nations|pages=Chapter XV}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the UN Charter. Staff-members are appointed by the Secretary-General alone and are assigned to the organs of the United Nations. Staff members are appointed on a temporary or permanent basis, under the discretion of the Secretary-General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Staff Regulations – 2003|url=http://cdu.unlb.org/Portals/0/PdfFiles/PolicyDocA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; During staff recruitment, geographical variety is an especially prominent selection factor in order to accurately reflect the scope of member states present in the UN.&lt;ref name="The UN Charter"&gt;{{cite book|title=The UN Charter|pages=Chapter XV, Article 101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charter states that staff members are responsible "only to the organization" and are prohibited from any action or influence that would suggest affiliation with a government or organization outside the UN.&lt;ref name="The UN Charter"/&gt;

Headquartered in New York, the Secretariat functions through duty stations in Addis Ababa, Bangkok, Beirut, Geneva, Nairobi, Santiago and Vienna, in addition to offices all over the world.&lt;ref name="Secretariat"/&gt;

One study finds the following factors play a role in the selection of staff for the Secretariat: a desire to achieve a minimum number of officials from each state; population size; and assessment of dues. The most overrepresented states in the Secretariat are small, rich democracies. The Nordic states stand out, in particular, when it comes to overrepresentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Who Runs the International System?

== Status of Women in the Secretariat==
Representation of women in the United Nations (UN), particularly at managerial and decision-making positions at the D-1 level and above, has been a United Nations General Assembly concern and goal since 1970.

In December 1994, the UN General Assembly's "disappointment" that its Gender Equality target were not met urged the Secretary General to prioritize the recruitment and promotion of women to reach to 50/50 representation in D1 and above posts by 2000.&lt;ref name="ST/SGB/282"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=United Nations|title=POLICIES TO ACHIEVE GENDER EQUALITY IN THE UNITED NATIONS|journal=SECRETARY-GENERAL'S BULLETIN|date=5 January 1996|volume=ST/SGB/282|pages=2|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/pdf/n9600282.pdf|accessdate=11 December 2014|publisher=Secretariat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A/RES/49/167 - 23/dec"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=General Assembly|title= Improvement of the status of women in the Secretariat|date=23 December 1994|volume=A/RES/49/167|issue=94th plenarymeeting|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/49/a49r167.htm|accessdate=11 December 2014|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Feb 2004, gender Parity target for the secretariat was once again revised to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=General Assembly|title=58/144.

===Representation of Women at Decision making levels ===
The representation of women in the UN secretariat, at the D1 level, in 2000, was 30.3 percent. Instead of increasing, in the next decade, the representation of women in the secretariat decreased to 26.7 percent&lt;ref name="A /65/334" /&gt;{{rp| p 29, Table 19}}In December 2011, the representation of women in the Secretariat at the D1 level was 27.4 percent, an increase of .6 percent over a two-year period.&lt;ref name="A /67/347"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=General Assembly|title=67/347 Improvement in the status of women in the United Nations system|journal=Report of the Secretary-General|date=4 September 2012|issue=A /67/347|pages=58 para 67|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/67/347|accessdate=11 December 2014|publisher=United Nations|quote=Advancement of women: implementation of the outcome of the Fourth World Conference on Women }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|p 50, fn 64}} At the current rate of progress, it is estimated that gender parity at the D-1 to higher levels will be achieved after 102 years.&lt;ref name="A /67/347" /&gt; {{rp|paragraph 133}} At D2 level The representation of women in 2011 was 24.4 percent&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt; {{rp|p 17}}

===Special Measures for the Achievement of Gender Equality===
{{Main article|Special Measures for Gender Equality in The United Nations(UN)}}
To ensure that the Gender Equality target mandated by the General Assembly are met, the Secretariat, in September 1999, promulgated Administrative Instruction(AI) on "Special Measures for the Achievement of Gender Equality"( ST/AI/1999/9 )&lt;ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=United Nations|title=ST /AI/1999/9.

On 4 September 2012, in his Annual Reports to the [[General Assembly of UN|General Assembly]], titled "Improvement of the status of women in the United Nations system", Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] stated that the aim of Special Measures was to ensure "gender balance in recruitment and promotion".&lt;ref name="A /67/347" /&gt;{{rp|p3, paragraph 67–68}} and that Special measures would remain in effect until the "goal of gender parity is achieved", and sustained for a period of time.&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|p 33, paragraph 67}}&lt;ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1" /&gt;"&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt; The Secretary General in his Recommendations to the GA noted that the " United Nations Secretariat, pursuant to the decision of the Policy Committee chaired by the Secretary-General" is to "ensure the effective implementation of special measures for gender equality. These measures include mandatory selection of equally or better qualified women candidates…"&lt;ref name="A /67/347" /&gt;{{rp| paragraph 147b}}

== Reforms ==
Since its creation, the Secretariat has undergone extensive reforms. On 21 March 2005, Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] proposed several reforms for the Secretariat. He announced his intentions to appoint a Scientific Adviser, create a peacebuilding support office, establish a cabinet-style decision-making mechanism, and strengthen the [[mediation]] function. He also asked the General Assembly to [[Appropriation (law)|appropriate]] funds for a one-time staff buyout; to work with him in revising [[budget]]ary and [[human resources]] rules; to grant the Secretary-General more managerial authority and flexibility; to strengthen the [[Office of Internal Oversight Services]]; and "to review all mandates older than five years to see whether the activities concerned are still genuinely needed or whether the resources assigned to them can be reallocated in response to new and emerging challenges".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/largerfreedom/chap5.htm V.

[[Image:Hajnal line.JPG|thumb|right|300px|To the west of the [[Hajnal line]], shown in red, the Western European marriage pattern arose. The blue lines mark areas of Western Europe that did not conform to Western Europe's marriage pattern]]

The '''Western European marriage pattern''' is a family and [[demographic]] pattern that is marked by comparatively late marriage (in the middle twenties), especially for women, with a generally small age difference between the spouses, a significant proportion of women who remain unmarried, and the establishment of a [[neolocality|neolocal household]] after the couple has married. 
In 1965, [[John Hajnal]] discovered that Europe is divided into two areas characterized by a different patterns of [[nuptiality]]. To the west of the line, marriage rates and thus fertility were comparatively low and a significant minority of women married late or remained single and most families were nuclear; to the east of the line and in the Mediterranean and particular regions of Northwestern Europe, early marriage and [[extended family]] homes were the norm and high fertility was countered by high mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Hajnal, John (1965): ''European marriage pattern in historical perspective'' en D.V. Glass and D.E.C. Eversley, (eds.) ''Population in History'', Arnold, Londres.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kertzer, David I and Marzio Barbagli. 2001. The history of the European family. New Haven: Yale University Press. p xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The shift toward this “Western European Marriage Pattern” does not have a clear beginning, but it certainly had become established by the end of the sixteenth century on most of the shores of the [[North Sea]]. A marriage pattern where couples married comparatively late in life (and especially late for the bride), on average in the middle twenties after and setting up a nuclear household, all of this preceded by time working as [[servant]]s or apprentices. Also, a significant proportion of women married after their twenties and [[Medieval singlewomen|10–20% of women never married]].&lt;ref name="Hajnal 1965 101–143"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hajnal |first=John |year=1965 |chapter=European marriage pattern in historical perspective |editor=D.V. Glass and D.E.C. Eversley |title=Population in History |publisher=Arnold, Londres |pages=101–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coontz, Stephanie. 2005.

New York City: Viking Press, Penguin Group Inc. p 125-129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=De Moor |first=Tine |first2=Jan Luiten |last2=van Zanden |year=2010 |title=Girl power: the European marriage pattern and labour markets in the North Sea region in the late medieval and early modern period |journal=[[The Economic History Review]] |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=1–33 [p. 17] |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00483.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects===
The pattern of late and non-universal marriage restricted fertility massively, especially when it was coupled with very low levels of childbirth out of wedlock. Birth control took place by delaying marriage more than suppressing fertility within it. A woman's life-phase from [[menarche]] (which was generally reached on average at 14 years, at about 12 years for elite women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Average age of Menarche in History |work=MUM |url=http://www.mum.org/menarage.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hajnal, John (1965): European marriage pattern in historical perspective en D.V. Glass and D.E.C. Eversley, (eds.) Population in History, Arnold, Londres. 123&lt;/ref&gt;) to the birth of her first child was unusually long, averaging ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seccombe |first=Wally |year=1992 |title=A Millennium of Family Change, Feudalism to Capitalism in Northwestern Europe |location= |publisher=Verso |isbn=0-86091-332-5 |pages=184–186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Amundsen |first=Darrel |last2=Dreis |first2=Carol Jean |year=1973 |title=The Age of Menarche in Medieval Europe |journal=[[Human Biology (journal)|Human Biology]] |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=363–369 |jstor=41459883 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compared to other cultures==
This marriage pattern varied across time and space and class; noblewomen certainly married early, but they were a small minority. The comparatively late age at marriage for women and the small age gap between spouses is rather unusual; women married as adults rather than as dependents, often worked before marriage and brought some skills into the marriage, were less likely to be exhausted by constant pregnancy, and were about the same age as their husbands &lt;ref&gt;Stone, Linda. 2010. Kinship and Gender. Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press. Pg. 227&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coontz, 2005. Pg. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

To the west of the [[Hajnal line]], about half of all women aged 15 to 50 years of age were married at any given time while the other half were [[widow]]s or [[spinster]]s; to the east of the line, about seventy percent of women in that age bracket were married at any given time while the other thirty percent were widows or [[nun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kertzer 2001; 224–225&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage records of Western and Eastern Europe in the early 20th century illustrate this pattern vividly; west of the [[Hajnal line]], only 25% of women aged 20–24 were married while to the east of the line, over 75% of women in this age group were married and less than five percent of women remained unmarried. Outside of Europe, women could be married even earlier and even fewer would remain celibate; in [[Korea]], practically every woman 50 years of age had been married and [[spinster]]s were extremely rare, compared to 10–25% of women in western Europe age 50 who had never married.&lt;ref name="Hajnal 1965 101–143"/&gt;

In the 15th century, the average Italian bride was 18 and married a groom 10–12 years her senior. An unmarried [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] woman 21 years of age would be seen as past [[marriageable age]], the [[wikt:benchmark|benchmark]] for which was 19 years, and easily 97 percent of [[Florence|Florentine]] women were married by the age of 25 years while 21 years was the average age of a contemporary English bride.&lt;ref&gt;Philips, Kim M. 2003.

==Background==

===Antiquity===
The beginnings of this marriage pattern might be found as early as the time of the Roman Empire. [[Julius Caesar]], writing in the first century B.C, wrote that while the [[Germanic tribes]] to the north of the empire were communal with their land, living under the [[Sippe]] kinship system, the homesteads were largely separate from each other, unlike the closer proximity in Roman towns. And [[Tacitus]], writing a century and a half later, also observed these many private households among the Germanic tribes, although there was public ownership of pastures and controlled use of the forests.&lt;ref&gt;Gies, Frances and Joseph. 1989. Marriage and Family in the Middle Ages. Harper Perennial. Pg. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anglo-Saxon]] kinship terms were generally very basic; the same word is used for the titles of nephew and grandson, likewise for the term for granddaughter and niece. Based on this, the nuclear household seems to be the norm. Also, since the Church forbade marrying within a given degree of kinship, the common people were probably further discouraged from keeping elaborate kinship networks; Britain only had so many people and virtually everybody on the island was related to some degree and possibly the distant relations had to be forgotten or nearly all marriages would be within the [[prohibited degrees of kinship#Medieval canon law|prohibited degrees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanawalt |first=Barbara A. |year=1986 |title=The Ties That Bound: Peasant Families in Medieval England |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-503649-2 |pages=79–83 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, while nuclear residences might have been the norm for families, the [[extended family]] was undeniably important for the Anglo-Saxons; As with many other [[Germanic tribes]], if a member of a family was wronged or injured in any way, the [[Law of Æthelberht|Kentish Laws]] outlines the restrictions of [[feud]]s and [[reparation (legal)|reparation]]s to the victim of the offense; kindreds were to take charge of reparation and they could (with a few exceptions, for example, when the conflict was too close in blood-line) arrange either for vengeance or for the payment of compensation to the kin of the killed.&lt;ref&gt;Hines, John. 1997. ''The Anglo-Saxons from the Migration Period to the Eighth Century''. Boydell Press. Pgs. 214–215.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Anglo-Saxon women, like those of other Germanic tribes, are marked as women from the age of twelve onward, based on archaeological finds, implying that the age of marriage coincided with [[puberty]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, Dennis Howard and Siegmund, Frank. 2003. ''The Continental Saxons from the Migration Period to the Tenth Century''. Boydell Press. Pg. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===

====Christianity and manorialism====
The rise of Christianity created more incentives to keep families nuclear; the Church instituted marriage laws and practices that undermined large kinship groups. From as early as the fourth century, the Church discouraged any practice that enlarged the family, like [[adoption]], [[polygamy]], taking [[concubines]], divorce, and [[remarriage]]. The Church severely discouraged and prohibited [[consanguineous]] marriages, a marriage pattern that has constituted a means to maintain kinship groups (and thus their power) throughout history; [[Canon law]] followed civil law until the early ninth century, when the [[Catholic Church|Western Church]] increased the number of prohibited degrees from four to seven.&lt;ref&gt;Bouchard, Constance B., 'Consanguinity and Noble Marriages in the Tenth and Eleventh Centuries', ''Speculum'', Vol. 56, No. 2 (Apr. 1981), pp. 269–70&lt;/ref&gt; The church also clipped the ability of parents to retain kinship ties through arranged marriages by forbidding unions in which the bride did not clearly agree to the union. These rules were not necessarily followed unanimously nor did all cultures across Europe evolve toward nuclear families, but by the latter half of the Middle Ages the nuclear household was dominant over most of Northwestern Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greif |first=Avner |authorlink=Avner Greif |year=2006 |title=Family Structure, Institutions, and Growth: The Origin and Implications of Western Corporatism |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=308–312 |jstor=30034664 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and where in the old [[indigenous religion]]s, women married between 12 and 15 years of age (coinciding with [[puberty]]) and men married in their middle twenties, as Christianity expanded men married increasingly earlier and women married increasingly later&lt;ref&gt;Herlihy, David. 1985. ''Medieval Households''. Harvard University Press. Pgs. 17–19&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of [[manorialism]] in the vacuum left after the [[Fall of Rome]] might also have weakened the ties of kinship at the same time that the Church had curtailed the power of [[clan]]s; as early as the 800s in [[Austrasia|northern France]], families that worked on manors were small, consisting of parents and children and occasionally a grandparent. The Church and State had become allies in erasing the solidarity and thus the political power of the clans; the Church sought to replace [[paganism|traditional religion]], whose vehicle was the kin group, and substituting the authority of the [[old age|elder]]s of the kin group with that of a religious elder, the [[presbyteros]]. At the same time, the king's rule was undermined by revolts on the part of powerful, [[communal]] kin groups, whose conspiracies and murders threatened the power of the state and, once manorialism had become established, also threatened the demand of manorial lords for obedient, compliant workers; in the west, manorialism was unsuccessful in establishing itself in [[Frisia]], [[History of Ireland (1169–1536)|Ireland]], [[Medieval Scotland|Scotland]], [[Medieval Wales|Wales]], [[Cornwall]], the [[East of England]], and the south of [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]] and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Heather, Peter. 1999. ''The Visigoths from the Migration Period to the Seventh Century: An Ethnographic Perspective''. Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd. Pgs 142–148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitterauer, Michael. 2010. ''Why Europe?: The Medieval Origins of Its Special Path''. University of Chicago Press. Pg. 53–57&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[peasant]]s and [[serf]]s lived and worked on farms that they rented from the lord of the [[manor]], and they also needed the permission of the lord to marry, couples therefore had to comply with the lord and wait until a small farm became available before they could marry and thus produce children; those who could and did delay marriage presumably were rewarded by the landlord and those who did not were presumably denied said reward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbdchick.wordpress.com/2012/02/06/medieval-manoralism-and-the-hajnal-line/ 2014. Medieval Manorialism and the Hajnal Line]&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, [[Medieval England]] saw [[marriageable age|marriage age]] as variable depending on economic circumstances, with couples delaying marriage until the early twenties when times were bad and the average age falling to the late teens after the [[Black Death]], when there were labor shortages;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanawalt |first=Barbara A. |year=1986 |title=The Ties That Bound: Peasant Families in Medieval England |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-503649-2 |pages=96 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by appearances, marriage of adolescents was not the norm in England.&lt;ref name="Hanawalt, p. 95-100" /&gt; The sudden loss of people from the plague resulted in a glut of lucrative jobs for many people and more people could afford to marry young, lowering the age at marriage to the late teens and thus increasing fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmberg, Stanford E. and Samantha A. Meigs. 2008. The Peoples of the British Isles: A New History: From Prehistoric Times to 1688. Lyceum Books. Pg. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

====The beginnings of consensual marriage====
About 1140, [[Decretum Gratiani|Gratian]] established that according to canon law the bonds of marriage should be determined by mutual [[consent]] and not [[consummation]], voicing opinions similar to Isaac's opinion of [[forced marriage]]s; marriages were made by God and the blessing of a priest should only be made after the fact. Therefore, a man and a woman could agree to marry each other at even the minimum [[age of consent]]- fourteen years for men, twelve years for women- and bring the priest after the fact. But this doctrine led to the problem of [[clandestinity (canon law)|clandestine marriage]], performed without witness or connection to public institution.&lt;ref&gt;De Moor 2009. Pg 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion of the parents was still important, although the final decision was not the decision to be made by the parents,&lt;ref&gt;Huijgen, Carolien. 2010. Family formation and marriage patterns: A comparison between Sri Lanka and Europe. University of Utrecht. 31 November 2011.&lt;igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for this new consent by both parties meant that a contract between equals was drawn rather than a coerced consensus.&lt;ref&gt;De Moor 2009. Pg 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patriarchy]] remained in some form or another, including the necessity of the [[dowry]] by young women. To curb secret marriages and remind young couples of parental power, the Medieval Church encouraged prolonged [[courtship]], arrangements and monetary logistics, informing the community of the wedding, and finally the formal exchange of [[vow]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Coontz, Stephanie. 2005. Marriage, a History: From Obedience to Intimacy, or How Love Conquered Marriage. New York City: Viking Press, Penguin Group Inc. Pg 107&lt;/ref&gt; While in the [[Southern Europe|South]] a woman's dowry was viewed as separate from her husband's wealth, in the Northwest the dowry was "[[Marriage|conjugal]]"; a woman's dowry merged with her husband's wealth and would grow or shrink depending on circumstances and to which she had rights in widowhood,&lt;ref&gt;De Moor, 2009. Pg 8&lt;/ref&gt; an attractive incentive for women to earn money. And the chance for women to earn money in the one hundred and fifty years after the [[Black Death]] was attractive, with less competition for jobs; as much as half of women in the North willingly worked to earn money for marriage while their Southern contemporaries were married or [[widow]]s before turning to work and unmarried young women only worked as a last resort, lest her honor be put at risk.&lt;ref&gt;De Moor 2009. Pgs 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Modern Europe===
The average age at first marriage had gradually risen again by late sixteenth century; the population had stabilized and availability of jobs and land had lessened. In the last decades of the century the age at marriage had climbed to averages of 25 for women and 27 for men in England and the Low Countries as more people married later or remained unmarried due to lack of money or resources and a decline in living standards, and these averages remained high for nearly two centuries and averages across Northwestern Europe had done likewise.&lt;ref&gt;De Moor, 2009. Pg 17&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its sacramental nature, marriage was increasingly held to be indissoluble, and sexual relations outside of marriage were viewed as illicit. Christian Europe banned polygamy and divorce, and attempted to prohibit any form of sexual relationship that was not marriage, such as concubine or premarital sex, termed fornication. Women were generally expected to bring a dowry when they married, which ranged from a few household goods to a whole province in the case of the high nobility. Remarriage after the death of a spouse was acceptable for both men and women, and very common, though men remarried faster than women. Most issues regarding marriage and many other aspects of family life came under the jurisdiction of church courts and were regulated by an increasingly elaborate legal system termed canon law. The ideals for marriage were not followed in many instances: powerful individuals could often persuade church courts to grant annulments of marriages they needed to end; men, including priests and other church leaders, had concubines and mistresses; young people had sex before marriage and were forced into marriages that they did not want. Nevertheless, these ideals and the institutions established to enforce them remained important shapers of men's and women's understanding of and place within a family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiesner-Hanks|first1=Merry E.|title=Gender in History: Global Perspectives|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-8995-8|page=37|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So many Englishmen began migrating en masse to North America that the marriage prospects for unmarried Englishwomen dwindled and the average age of first marriage rose for Englishwomen. In addition, there was a sharp rise in the percentage of women who remained unmarried and thus decreased fertility; an Englishwoman marrying at the average age of 26 years in the late 17th century who survived her childbearing years would bear an average of 5.03 children while an Englishwoman making a comparable marriage in the early 19th century at the average age of 23.5 years and surviving her childbearing years would bear on average 6.02 children, an increase of about 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wrigley |first=E. A. |year=1997 |title=English Population History from Family Reconstitution 1580–1837 |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn= |pages=135–139 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cressy pg 285" /&gt;

From 1619 to 1660 in the archdiocese of [[Canterbury]], England, the median age of the brides was 22 years and nine months while the median age for the grooms was 25 years and six months, with average ages of 24 years for the brides and nearly 28 years for the grooms, with the most common ages at marriage being 22 years for women and 24 years for men; the Church dictated that the age when one could marry without the consent of one's parents was 21 years. A large majority of English brides in this time were at least 19 years of age when they married, and only one bride in a thousand was thirteen years of age or younger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laslett |first=Peter |year=1965 |title=The World We Have Lost |location=New York |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |page=82 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Shakespeare]]'s drama ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''  puts [[Juliet#Juliet's age|Juliet]]'s age at just short of fourteen years; the idea of a woman marrying in secret at a very early age would have scandalized Elizabethans. The common belief in Elizabethan England was that motherhood before 16 was dangerous; popular manuals of health, as well as observations of married life, led Elizabethans to believe that early marriage and its consummation permanently damaged a young woman's health, impaired a young man's physical and mental development, and produced sickly or stunted children. Therefore, 18 came to be considered the earliest reasonable age for motherhood and 20 and 30 the ideal ages for women and men, respectively, to marry. Shakespeare might also have reduced Juliet's age from sixteen to fourteen to demonstrate the dangers of marriage at too young of an age; that Shakespeare himself married [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare)|Anne Hathaway]] when he was just eighteen (very unusual for an Englishman of the time) might hold some significance.&lt;ref name="Franson, J. Karl 1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Franson |first=J.
