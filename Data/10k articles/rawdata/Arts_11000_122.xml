'''''Angela's Ashes: A Memoir''''' is a 1996 [[memoir]] by the Irish-American author Frank McCourt, with various anecdotes and stories of his childhood. It details his very early childhood in [[Brooklyn, New York]], but focuses primarily on his life in [[Limerick, Ireland]]. It also includes his struggles with poverty and his father's [[alcoholism]].

The book was published in 1996 and won the 1997 [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography]]. A sequel, ''[['Tis]]'', was published in 1999, followed by ''[[Teacher Man]]'' in 2005.

==Synopsis==
Born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], on 19 August 1930, Frank (Francis) McCourt is the oldest son of Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan McCourt. Both of his parents emigrated from Ireland and married in a shotgun wedding over Angela's pregnancy with Frankie. Angela is originally from Limerick, Ireland, and is fond of music, singing, and dancing. Malachy, from Northern Ireland, is an alcoholic known for his "odd manner" and for telling fantastical stories about Irish heroes. Frankie is often said to closely resemble his father, having a hang-dog face and the same "odd manner." The narrative is told from the point of view of Frankie as a child.

In America, the McCourts live in modern tenement housing next to a park and share a floor, and a communal lavatory, with other immigrant families from Ireland, Italy, and the Jewish communities.

Frankie has four younger siblings: [[Malachy McCourt|Malachy]], born in 1931, who is often favored over Frankie for being an attractive, open child; blond twins Oliver and Eugene, born in 1932; and an infant sister, Margaret, in 1935.

The family often struggles with poverty as Malachy Sr. engages in an endless struggle to find work and alcohol. The family's prospects, and Angela's spirits, lift whenever he finds a new job and brings home his first week's wages, but eventually he finds himself spending all of his pay in pubs, despite Angela's many schemes to prevent him from doing so, and losing his job after a few weeks.

Margaret's birth seems to instill new life into the family: the whole family falls in love with her, Malachy Sr most of all. He gives up drinking and finds steady work to support the family. However, due to her parents' ignorance of children's disease, Margaret lives for only seven weeks. With her death, Malachy Sr abandons his family for days to indulge in an alcoholic binge, while Angela falls into a severe, debilitating depression. Frank, age six, is forced to feed and care for his younger siblings, often with the kind intervention of the neighbors. The neighbors soon realize the family's dire straits and intervene, contacting Angela's cousins, who in turn recommend the family return to Ireland with Angela's family in [[Limerick, Ireland|Limerick]].

Angela is pregnant with a new baby, as they return to Ireland from America, and lose the child, shortly after moving to Limerick.

The [[Great Depression]] has struck Ireland, particularly Limerick, even harder than it did the United States. There is little work, and conditions for poor families are miserable. Malachy Sr finds it even more difficult to find work because of his Northern Ireland accent and mannerisms, the children are mocked for their American accents, and many neighbors, as well as Angela's family, look down on the McCourts for their return from America.

The family is forced to rely on [[Welfare|the dole]] and charity from the local [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul]], which requires extensive, and humiliating application processes. Angela and Malachy Sr often argue about this as Malachy drinks the welfare money meant to feed the family, and views Angela's asking for charity as begging and degrading. For many years, the family subsists on little more than bread and tea.

Within a year of the family's arrival, Oliver and Eugene also die—Oliver of what is implied to be [[scarlet fever]] and Eugene, a few months later, from grieving the loss of his twin and malnutrition. After each death, Angela sinks into depression, and the family moves because she cannot bear being in the same house. Each move results in the McCourts sliding down into worse and worse circumstances. Eventually, they end up living in a slum house. The entire ground floor floods for half a year, requiring the family to live in an upstairs room together. Their house is located next to the only lavatory on the whole street. There is a constant traffic of families dumping chamber pots in the filthy lavatory, which often backs up and smells. Two additional baby brothers, Michael (born 1936), and [[Alphie McCourt|Alphie]] (Alphonsus, b.&amp;nbsp;1940), are born in Limerick.

Frankie grows up in Limerick as a sensitive and intelligent child. He often makes unique observations from those around him and has an emotional need to help. His strict Catholic upbringing preys on his imaginative nature and thoughts on whether he will be going to hell plague on his mind. Frankie must balance his Catholic beliefs against a church which frequently rejects him due to his poverty and family, his Irish upbringing against his desire to return to America once he's grown, and his desire for his father's attention against his loyalty to his mother. Strangers often prefer his more attractive and outgoing siblings, but Frankie wins over a few champions, mainly in the form of his school teachers and the various adults who hire him for odd jobs.

Frank develops [[typhoid fever]] and is taken to a Catholic hospital, where for the first time he has adequate food, warmth, and access to limitless books, and the time to read them, giving birth to his lifelong love of literature. Frankie additionally contracts chronic [[conjunctivitis]], which does little to improve his looks or perceived, sarcastic demeanor.

At the outbreak of [[World War II]], many Limerick men find work at a defence plant in [[Coventry, England]], leaving their families behind and sending back money to support them. These good-paying jobs lift many of the McCourts' neighbors out of poverty. Malachy Sr leaves the family behind and secures a defence job. For several weeks, the payments allow the family to enjoy small luxuries such as candy and visits to the movies. But soon, the money stops coming and Malachy Sr abandons his family for good.

Frank and his brothers begin to scavenge the streets for [[coal]] or [[peat]] turf for fuel. They also steal leftover food from restaurants at the end of the day and grocery deliveries from doorsteps.

Eventually, the family is evicted and homeless. With few options, Angela and her children move in with her bachelor cousin, Laman Griffin. Laman is a petty tyrant who resents the presence of the children and enjoys degrading them and Angela. A preteen Frankie resents this treatment, but puts up with it for his mother and younger brothers. Upon discovering that part of Laman's deal for providing housing is a sexual relationship with Angela, Frankie has a fight with Laman and is thrown out of the house. Shortly after, Malachy Jr leaves Laman Griffin's to join the military as a bugle boy.

Frankie moves in with his maternal uncle, who was dropped on his head as a child and now lives in the house left to him by his deceased mother. Frank gets a job as a telegram delivery boy on his 14th birthday and begins to support himself while saving for his passage to America. The interesting people and situations Frankie meets on his deliveries cause him to grow as a person.

Frankie supports his youngest brothers by providing food and respite from Laman Griffin when they come to visit him. Eventually, his brothers ask if they can move in with him, which he allows, and they are shortly followed by Angela. Frankie must now turn over the majority of his wages to his mother as the bread winner of the family, though he still takes on various odd jobs to earn extra for his ticket to America, such as writing threatening collection letters on behalf of a local [[moneylender]].

On his sixteenth birthday, Frank's uncle takes him to the pub to buy him his first beer. Frank gets drunk and returns home, singing like his father used to. When his mother shames him for drinking the way his father did, Frank hits her, accusing her of being a whore for Laman Griffin, and is immediately ashamed of himself.

One day Frank returns to the moneylender's home to find she has died. Liberated, Frank takes money from her purse and throws her ledger of debtors into the river to free the neighborhood of their debts. The contents of the moneylender's purse give him enough money to return to America at the age of nineteen. Frank arrives in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]], ready to begin a new life in the country of his birth.

==Film==
In 1999&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145653/&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Angela's Ashes (film)|film]] version was released.

Criticism of the arts can be broadly divided into two types. There is [[academia|academic]] criticism such as that found in scholarly works and specialist journals, then there is criticism of a more journalistic nature (often called 'a [[review]]') which is seen by a wider public through newspapers, television and radio. The academic criticism will be of a more vigorous and analytical nature than the journalistic, the journalistic may even focus on entertaining the reader at the expense of detail about the art under discussion.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

'''''At a Window in the Artist's Studio''''' is a drawing by the Danish painter, [[C. W. Eckersberg]]. It was done in 1852.

The drawing shows two girls by a window; these girls are probably the daughters of the artist. They are shown by a window facing [[Kongens Nytorv]] in [[Copenhagen]] but they are not watching anything on the square; they are reading a book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smk.dk/udforsk-kunsten/kunsthistorier/vaerker/vis/ved-et-vindue-i-kunstnerens-atelier-1852/ |title=At holde kaos på afstand|last1=Knudsen |first1=Vibeke Vibolt |last2= |first2= |date=2 February 2013 |work= |publisher=National Gallery of Denmark |accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maggie's freedom is compromised, and she believes she must keep her blossoming affair a secret. However, the clandestine romance introduces Maggie's family to a host of new experiences, many of which are "better than chocolate".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9403E4DB1439F930A2575BC0A96F958260 "FILM REVIEW; The Many Flavors of Love, For Just About Any Taste"].

==Awards==
The film screened at film festivals around the world and was ranked 31st on ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Top 200 [[independent film]]s list of 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popmatters.com/feature/71692-decade-dense-the-60-best-films-of-1999-part-3a/ "The Sixth Sense to Fight Club (August - October 1999)"]. ''Pop Matters'', 24 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background ==
The film was created with a budget of $1.6 million.&lt;ref name="Melnyk2004" /&gt; It was co-produced by Peggy Thompson and Sharon McGowan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/doc/437999587.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+13%2C+1999&amp;author=Walker%2C+Susan&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=1&amp;desc=Nothing+better+than+Chocolate+for+veteran+director+Wheeler "Nothing better than Chocolate for veteran director Wheeler"]. ''Toronto Star'' - Toronto, Ont. Walker, Susan. Aug 13, 1999. Page: 	E1&lt;/ref&gt;

The film takes its name from a lyric in [[Sarah McLachlan]]'s song "Ice Cream", "Your love is better than chocolate". Veena Sood, the sister of McLachlan's then-husband [[Ashwin Sood]], has a small role in the film as a religious protestor.

The plot line about the bookstore is a fairly direct reference to Vancouver's [[Little Sister's Book and Art Emporium]] and its [[Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada (Minister of Justice)|travails]] with [[Canada Customs]].  The bookstore is thanked in the credits. Ann-Marie MacDonald, who plays the bookstore's owner, is a well-known Canadian author.

The movie poster, which shows two women embracing and one woman's naked back, was banned by the [[Hong Kong]] Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority as it was deemed "offensive to public morality, decency and ordinary good taste."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200003/30/0330206.htm Statement for the decision on a poster for a Category III film]&lt;/ref&gt;  An advertisement in the ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' was also removed, due to the word "lesbian" being present on the movie poster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/legal/torts-intentional-torts-libel-slander/6701688-1.html San Diego Union-Tribune Refuses to Run The Word 'Lesbian' in Advertising]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack of the film was released as a CD in 1999 on Lakeshore Records.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/album/better-than-chocolate-mw0000256186 "Original Soundtrack Better Than Chocolate"]. ''AllMusic'', Review by Stacia Proefrock&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blurbing.jpg|thumb|The original blurb]]

A '''blurb''' is a short [[promotion (marketing)|promotional]] piece accompanying a creative work. It may be written by the author or publisher or quote praise from others. Blurbs were originally printed on the back or rear dust-jacket of a book, and are now found on home video cases, [[web portal]]s, and [[news website]]s. A blurb may introduce a newspaper or magazine feature story.

== History==
[[File: Gelett Burgess.jpg|thumb|Gelett Burgess circa 1910]]
In the US, the history of the blurb is said to begin with [[Walt Whitman]]'s collection, ''[[Leaves of Grass]]''. In response to the publication of the first edition in 1855, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] had sent Whitman a congratulatory letter, including the phrase "I greet you at the beginning of a great career": the following year, Whitman had these words stamped in gold leaf on the spine of the second edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/09/27/429723002/forget-the-book-have-you-read-this-irresistible-story-on-blurbs|title=The Curious Case Of The Book Blurb (And Why It Exists)|last=Dwyer|first=Colin|date=27 September 2015|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''blurb'' was coined in 1907 by American humorist [[Gelett Burgess]] (1866–1951).&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of The English Language''. Ed. [[David Crystal]]. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1995. p. 132. {{ISBN|0521401798}}&lt;/ref&gt; His short 1906 book ''Are You a Bromide?'' was presented in a limited edition to an annual trade association dinner. The custom at such events was to have a [[dust jacket]] promoting the work and with, as Burgess' publisher [[B. W. Huebsch]] described it, "the picture of a damsel—languishing, heroic, or coquettish—anyhow, a damsel on the jacket of every novel".

In this case, the jacket proclaimed "YES, this is a 'BLURB'!" and the picture was of a (fictitious) young woman "Miss Belinda Blurb" shown calling out, described as "in the act of blurbing." The name and term stuck for any publisher's contents on a book's back cover, even after the picture was dropped and only the text remained.

In Germany, the blurb is regarded to have been invented by [[Karl Robert Langewiesche]] around 1902. In German bibliographic usage, it is usually located on the second page of the book underneath the [[half title]], or on the dust cover.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==Books==
A blurb on a book can be any combination of quotes from the work, the author, the publisher, reviewers or fans, a summary of the plot, a biography of the author or simply claims about the importance of the work.

In the 1980s, ''[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]'' ran a regular feature called "[[Logrolling]] in Our Time" which exposed writers who wrote blurbs for one another's books.&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2006/more/reviews/spy-the-funny-years-1200511592/ | title=Spy: The Funny Years | publisher=Variety | accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blurb requests===

Prominent writers can receive large volumes of blurb requests from aspiring authors.  This has led some writers to turn down such requests as a matter of policy.  For example, [[Gary Shteyngart]] announced in ''The New Yorker'' that he would no longer write blurbs, except for certain writers with whom he had a professional or personal connection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/an-open-letter-from-gary-shteyngart]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Neil Gaiman]] reports that "Every now and again, I stop doing blurbs.... The hiatus lasts for a year or two, and then I feel guilty or someone asks me at the right time, and I relent."&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2001/04/american-gods-blog-post-36.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob M. Appel]] reports that he received fifteen to twenty blurb requests per week and tackles "as many as I can."&lt;ref&gt;Writers's Voice, Oct 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parody blurbs===

Many humorous books and films parody blurbs that deliver exaggerated praise by unlikely people and [[Backhanded compliment|insults disguised as praise]].
* ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' – "Makes Ben Hur look like an Epic"
* ''[[1066 and All That]]'' – "We look forward keenly to the appearance of their last work"

The ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'' satire of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', entitled ''[[Bored of the Rings]]'', deliberately used phony blurbs by deceased authors on the inside cover. One of the blurbs stated "One of the two or three books ...", and nothing else.

==Film==

Movie blurbs are part of the [[film promotion|promotional campaign]] for films, and usually consist of positive, colorful extracts from published reviews.

Movie blurbs have often been faulted for [[Fallacy of quoting out of context|taking words out of context]].&lt;ref&gt;Reiner, L. (1996). "Why Movie Blurbs Avoid Newspapers." ''Editor &amp; Publisher: The Fourth Estate, 129,'' 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gelfmagazine.com/archives/the_best_worst_blurbs_of_2007.php |author=Bialik, Carl |authorlink=Carl Bialik |date=January 6, 2008|title=The Best Worst Blurbs of 2007: The 10 most egregious misquotes, blurb whores, and other movie-ad sins of 2007 |work=Gelf Magazine |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2010/03/good-blurbs-from-bad-reviews-repo-men-the-bounty-hunter-diary-of-a-wimpy-kid |author=Sancton, Julian |date=March 19, 2010 |title=Good Blurbs from Bad Reviews: ''Repo Men'', ''The Bounty Hunter'', ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' |work=Vanity Fair |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGlone, Matthew S. (2005). "Contextomy: The Art of Quoting Out of Context." ''Media Culture, &amp; Society,'' Vol. 27, No. 4, 511-522.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that "the blurbing game is also evolving as newspaper film critics disappear and studios become more comfortable quoting Internet bloggers and movie Web sites in their ads, a practice that still leaves plenty of potential for filmgoers to be bamboozled. Luckily for consumers, there is a cavalry: blurb watchdog sites have sprung up and the number of Web sites that aggregate reviews by established critics is steadily climbing. ... Helping to keep studios in line these days are watchdog sites like eFilmCritic.com and The Blurbs, a Web column for ''Gelf'' magazine written by Carl Bialik of ''The Wall Street Journal''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barnes |first=Brooks |title=Hollywood's Blurb Search Reaches the Blogosphere |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 6, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/weekinreview/07barnes.html |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' wrote in an "Explainer" column: "How much latitude do movie studios have in writing blurbs? A fair amount. There's no official check on running a misleading movie blurb, aside from the usual laws against false advertising. Studios do have to submit advertising materials like newspaper ads and trailers to the Motion Picture Association of America for approval. But the MPAA reviews the ads for their tone and content, not for the accuracy of their citations. ... As a courtesy, studios will often run the new, condensed quote by the critic before sending it to print."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2009/11/best_film_ever.html |author=Beam, Chris |authorlink=Chris Beam |date=Nov 25, 2009 |title='(Best) Film Ever!!!' How Do Movie Blurbs Work? |work=Slate |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many examples exist of blurb used in marketing a film being traceable directly back to the film's marketing team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

"'''Bookland'''" is the informal name for the [[Unique Country Code]] (UCC) prefix allocated in the 1980s for [[European Article Number]] (EAN) identifiers of published [[book]]s, regardless of country of origin, so that the EAN [[namespace]] can catalogue books by [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] rather than maintaining a redundant parallel numbering system. In other words, Bookland is a fictitious country that exists solely in EAN for the purposes of non-geographically cataloguing books in the otherwise geographically keyed EAN coding system.

== History ==
Until January 1, 2007, all ISBNs were allocated as 9-digit numbers followed by a [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 11 [[checksum]] character that was either a decimal digit or the letter X.  A Bookland EAN was generated by concatenating the Bookland UCC 978, the 9 digits of the book's ISBN other than its checksum, and the EAN checksum digit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.isbn-information.com/the-13-digit-isbn.html Anatomy of a 13-digit ISBN]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5Z5I3gnFh0C&amp;pg=PA265 |title=Elementary number theory with applications |author=Thomas Koshy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since parts of the 10-character ISBN space are nearly full, all books published from 2007 on have been allocated a 13-digit [[ISBN]], which is identical to the Bookland EAN.  Most of UCC 979  (formerly "Musicland") has now been assigned for the expansion of Bookland,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KjveruEBBfoC&amp;pg=PT41 |title=Book Marketing Demystified |author=Bruce Trelawny Batchelor}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was first used by publishers in the French language, which can now use the additional prefix "979-10-" in addition to the nearly full "978-2-" prefix (onto which legacy 10-character ISBNs starting with "2-" have been remapped).  Books numbered with prefixes other than 978 will not be mappable to 10-character ISBNs.

The GS1 is the global identification standards organization for retail. Every country has an assigned country code which precedes the company code. The "country codes" 978 and 979 are now officially registered for allocation by the [[International ISBN Agency]], which maintains the official international registry of ISBN numbers allocated to book publishers.

==Similar mappings==

* [[ISSN]]s (which identify [[periodical publication]]s) are mapped into the UCC 977.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jKcpAQAAIAAJ |title=International literary market place |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[ISMN]]s (which identify [[sheet music]]) are mapped into the UCC 979. Since the leading "M" of a legacy 10-digit ISMN number (such as M-345-24680-5) is transcoded as 0, the EAN prefix 979-0 is wholly reserved for sheet music and has been dubbed the fictitious country "Musicland". Like ISBNs, ISMNs have been officially allocated using 13 digits since mid-2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ismn-international.org/download/GuidelinesGeneral.pdf Guidelines for the Implementation of 13-Digit ISMNs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership is limited to associations which require their members to adhere to extremely strict quality and expertise standards. Dealers who are affiliated with CINOA through their art and antique trade associations often display the CINOA logo as support of the CINOA charter and guidelines.

The stated goals of CINOA are to:
* Encourage high ethical standards within the trade
* Disseminate practical information on the art market
* Facilitate legitimate circulation of artworks throughout the world

Since 1976, CINOA has been awarding a yearly [[CINOA Prize]] to art historians or major art market players "in recognition of an academic publication or a remarkable contribution to furthering the cultural preservation through art works in a CINOA member country".&lt;ref&gt;CINOA, [http://www.cinoa.org/index.pl?id=2218;isa=Category;op=show "The CINOA Prize"] (page retrieved November 24th, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[visual arts]], '''composition''' is the placement or arrangement of visual elements or 'ingredients' in a work of art, as distinct from the subject. It can also be thought of as the organization of the [[elements of art]] according to the [[principles of art]].

The composition of a picture is different from its subject, what is depicted, whether a moment from a story, a person or a place.  Many subjects, for example [[Saint George and the Dragon]], are often portrayed in art, but using a great range of compositions even though the two figures are typically the only ones shown.   

The term composition means 'putting together' and can apply to any work of art, from music to writing to photography, that is arranged using conscious thought. In the visual arts, composition is often used interchangeably with various terms such as ''design, form, visual ordering,'' or ''formal structure,'' depending on the context. In [[graphic design]] for press and [[desktop publishing]], composition is commonly referred to as [[page layout]].

==Elements of design==
{{Main|Elements of art}}

The various visual elements, known as ''elements of design'', ''formal elements'', or ''elements of art,'' constitute the vocabulary with which the visual artist composes. These elements in the overall design usually relate to each other and to the whole art work.

The elements of design are:
*Line — the visual path that enables the eye to move within the piece
*[[Shape]] — areas defined by edges within the piece, whether geometric or organic
*[[Color]] — hues with their various values and intensities
*[[Texture (visual arts)|Texture]] — surface qualities which translate into tactile illusions
*[[Lightness (color)|Value]] — Shading used to emphasize form 
*Form — 3-D length, width, or depth 
*[[Space]] — the space taken up by (positive) or in between (negative) objects


===Line and shape===
Lines are optical phenomena that allow the artist to direct the eye of the viewer. The optical illusion of lines do exist in nature and visual arts elements can be arranged to create this illusion. The viewer unconsciously reads near continuous arrangement of different elements and subjects at varying distances. Such elements can be of dramatic use in the composition of the image. These could be literal lines such as telephone and power cables or rigging on boats. Lines can derive also from the borders of areas of differing color or contrast, or sequences of discrete elements. Movement is also a source of line, and blur can also create a reaction.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Subject lines contribute to both mood and [[linear perspective]], giving the viewer the illusion of depth. Oblique lines convey a sense of movement and angular lines generally convey a sense of dynamism and possibly tension. Lines can also direct attention towards the main subject of picture, or contribute to organization by dividing it into compartments. The artist may exaggerate or create lines perhaps as part of their message to the viewer. Many lines without a clear subject point suggest chaos in the image and may conflict with the mood the artist is trying to evoke.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Straight left lines create different moods and add affection to visual arts. A line's angle and its relationship to the size of the frame influence the mood of the image.  Horizontal lines, commonly found in [[landscape photography]], can give the impression of calm, tranquility, and space. An image filled with strong vertical lines tends to have the impression of height and grandeur. Tightly angled convergent lines give a dynamic, lively, and active effect to the image. Strongly angled, almost [[diagonal]] lines produce tension in the image. The viewpoint of visual art is very important because every different perspective views different angled lines. This change of perspective elicits a different response to the image. By changing the perspective only by some degrees or some centimetres lines in images can change tremendously and a totally different feeling can be transported. Straight lines are also strongly influenced by tone, color, and repetition in relation to the rest of the image.

Compared to straight lines, curves provide a greater dynamic influence in a picture. They are also generally more aesthetically pleasing, as the viewer associates them with softness. In photography, curved lines can give graduated shadows when paired with soft-directional lighting, which usually results in a very harmonious line structure within the image.

===Color===
There are three properties of color. Hue, brightness, and value. Hue is simply the name of a color, (red, yellow, and blue, etc.) Brightness refers to the intensity and strength of the color. The lightness and darkness to a color is the value. Color also has the ability to work within our emotions. Given that, we can use color to create mood. It can also be used as tone, pattern, light, movement, symbol, form, harmony, and contrast. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esaak|first1=Shelley|title=What is the Definition of Color in Art?|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-color-in-art-182429|website=ThoughtCo.|accessdate=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Element of Design: Color|url=http://www.wcs.k12.mi.us/cousino/wcsart/art%20foundatons%20site/color.html|website=Art Foundations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texture===
Texture refers to how an object feels or how it looks like it may feel if it were touched. There are two ways we experience texture, physically and optically. Different techniques can be used to create physical texture, which allows qualities of visual art to be seen and felt. This can include surfaces such as metal, sand, and wood. Optical texture is when the illusion of physical texture is created. Photography, paintings, and drawings use visual texture to create a more realistic appearance. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Visual Elements|url=http://www.artyfactory.com/art_appreciation/visual-elements/texture.html|website=Artyfactory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Value===
Lightness and darkness is what creates value in visual art. Value deals with how light reflects off of objects and how we see it. The more light, the higher the value. White is the highest or lightest value while black is the lowest or darkest value. Colors also have value, for example, yellow has a high value while blue has a low value. This is a very important element of design, especially in painting and drawing, to be able to create the illusion of light with contrast. Contrast is needed to understand two-dimensional artwork. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fussell|first1=Matt|title=The Elements of Art-"Value"|url=http://thevirtualinstructor.com/Value.html|website=The Virtual Instructor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Form===
The term form can mean different things in visual art. Form suggests a three-dimensional object in space. It is also described as the physical nature of the artwork, such as sculptures. It can also be looked at as art form, which can be expressed through fine art. A form encloses volume, has length, width, and height, unlike a shape, which is only two-dimensional. Forms that are mathematical, a sphere, pyramid, cube, cylinder, and cone, are known as geometric forms. Organic forms are typically irregular and asymmetrical. This form can be found in nature, such as flowers, rocks, trees, etc., but can also be seen in architecture. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marder|first1=Lisa|title=What Does the Term 'Form' Mean in Regards to Art?|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-form-in-art-182437|website=ThoughtCo.|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forms in drawing and painting convey the illusion of three-dimensional form through lighting, shadows, value, and tone.  The more contrast in value, the more pronounced the three-dimensional form is. Forms with little value appear flatter than those with greater variation and contrast.

===Space===
Space is the area around, above, and within an object. Photographers can capture space, architects build space, and painters create space. This element is found in each of the visual arts. It can be positive or negative, open or closed, shallow or deep, and two-dimensional or three-dimensional. In drawing or painting, space is not actually there, but the illusion of it is. Positive space is the subject of the piece. The empty spaces around, above, and within, is negative space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esaak|first1=Shelley|title=Exploring the Spaces Between and Within Us|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-space-in-art-182464|website=ThoughtCo.|accessdate=February 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Space?|url=https://www.sophia.org/tutorials/elements-of-art-space|website=Sophia|publisher=Sophia Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of organization==
{{Main|Principles of art}}

The artist determines what the center of interest (focus in [[photography]]) of the art work will be, and composes the elements accordingly. The gaze of the viewer will then tend to linger over these points of interest, elements are arranged with consideration of several factors (known variously as the ''principles of organization, principles of art,'' or ''principles of design'') into a harmonious whole which works together to produce the desired statement – a phenomenon commonly referred to as '''unity.''' Such factors in composition should not be confused with the elements of art (or elements of [[design]]) themselves. For example, shape is an ''element''; the usage of shape is characterized by various ''principles.''

Some principles of organization affecting the composition of a picture are:
* Shape and proportion
* Positioning/orientation/balance/[[harmony]] among the elements
* The area within the [[field of view]] used for the picture ("[[cropping]]")
* The path or direction followed by the viewer's eye when they observe the image.
* Negative space
* Color
* Contrast: the value, or degree of lightness and darkness, used within the picture.
* Arrangement: for example, use of the [[golden section|golden mean]] or the [[rule of thirds]]
* [[Composition (visual arts)#Line and shape|Lines]]
* Rhythm
* Illumination or [[lighting]]
* Repetition (sometimes building into pattern; rhythm also comes into play, as does geometry)
* [[Perspective (graphical)|Perspective]]
* Breaking the rules can create tension or unease, yet it can add interest to the picture if used carefully

===Viewpoint (leading with the eye)===
The position of the viewer can strongly influence the aesthetics of an image, even if the subject is entirely imaginary and viewed "within the mind's eye". Not only does it influence the elements within the picture, but it also influences the viewer's interpretation of the subject.

For example, if a boy is photographed from above, perhaps from the eye level of an adult, he is diminished in stature.  A photograph taken at the child's level would treat him as an equal, and one taken from below could result in an impression of dominance. Therefore, the photographer is choosing the viewer's positioning.

A subject can be rendered more dramatic when it fills the frame. There exists a tendency to perceive things as larger than they actually are, and filling the frame full fills this psychological mechanism. This can be used to eliminate distractions from the background.

In photography, altering the position of the camera can change the image so that the subject has fewer or more distractions with which to compete. This may be achieved by getting closer, moving laterally, tilting, panning, or moving the camera vertically.

==Compositional techniques==
There are numerous approaches or "compositional techniques" to achieve a sense of unity within an artwork, depending on the goals of the artist. For example, a work of art is said to be aesthetically pleasing to the eye if the elements within the work are arranged in a balanced compositional way.&lt;ref name="Dunstan"&gt;Dunstan, Bernard. (1979). ''Composing Your Paintings''. London, Studio Vista.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are artists such as [[Salvador Dalí]] who aim to disrupt traditional composition and challenge the viewer to rethink balance and design elements within art works.

Conventional composition can be achieved with a number of techniques:

===Rule of thirds===
{{Main|Rule of thirds}}
The rule of thirds is a composition guide that states that arranging the important features of an image on or near the horizontal and vertical lines that would divide the image into thirds horizontally and vertically is visually pleasing. The objective is to stop the subject(s) and areas of interest (such as the horizon) from bisecting the image, by placing them near one of the lines that would divide the image into three equal columns and rows, ideally near the intersection of those lines.

[[Image:Rule of thirds photo.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Rule of thirds: Note how the horizon falls close to the bottom grid line, and how the dark areas are in the left third, the overexposed in the right third.]]

The rule of thirds is thought to be a simplification of the [[golden ratio]]. The golden ratio is thought to have been used by artists throughout history as a composition guide, but [[Mathematics and art#Golden ratio|there is little evidence to support this claim]].

===Rule of odds===

The "rule of odds" suggests that an odd number of subjects in an image is more interesting than an even number. Thus if you have more than one subject in your picture, the suggestion is to choose an arrangement with at least three subjects. An even number of subjects produces symmetries in the image, which can appear less natural for a naturalistic, informal composition.

An image of a person surrounded/framed by two other persons, for instance, where the person in the center is the object of interest in that image/artwork, is more likely to be perceived as friendly and comforting by the viewer, than an image of a single person with no significant surroundings.

===Rule of space===
{{Main|Lead room}}
The rule of space applies to artwork (photography, advertising, illustration) picturing object(s) to which the artist wants to apply the illusion of movement, or which is supposed to create a contextual bubble in the viewer's mind.

This can be achieved, for instance, by leaving [[White space (visual arts)|white space]] in the direction the eyes of a portrayed person are looking, or, when picturing a runner, adding white space in front of him rather than behind him to indicate movement.

===Simplification===
Images with clutter can distract from the main elements within the picture and make it difficult to identify the subject.  By decreasing the extraneous content, the viewer is more likely to focus on the primary objects. Clutter can also be reduced through the use of lighting, as the brighter areas of the image tend to draw the eye, as do lines, squares and colour. In painting, the artist may use less detailed and defined brushwork towards the edges of the picture.Removing the elements to the focus of the object, taking only the needed components.

====Shallow depth of field====
In photography, and also (via software simulation of real lens limitations) in [[3D graphics]], one approach to achieving simplification is to use a wide aperture when shooting to limit the [[depth of field]].  When used properly in the right setting, this technique can place everything that is not the subject of the photograph out of focus.

{| align="center"
|valign="top"|[[Image:Jonquil flowers at f5.jpg|center|250px|thumb|The blurred background focuses the eye on the flowers.]]
|valign="top"|[[Image:Jonquil flowers at f32.jpg|center|250px|thumb|At a smaller aperture, the background competes for the viewer’s attention.]]
|}

A similar approach, given the right equipment, is to take advantage of the [[Scheimpflug principle]] to change the plane of focus.

===Geometry and symmetry===

Related to the rule of odds is the observation that triangles are an aesthetically pleasing implied shape within an image. In a [[Aesthetic canon|canonically]] attractive face, the mouth and eyes fall within the corners of the area of an equilateral triangle. [[Paul Cézanne]] successfully used triangles in his compositions of [[still life]]s. A triangular format creates a sense of stability and strength.

===Creating movement===
It is generally thought to be more pleasing to the viewer if the image encourages the eye to move around the image, rather than immediately fixating on a single place or no place in particular. Artists will often strive to avoid creating compositions that feel "static" or "flat" by incorporating movement into the image. In image A the 2 mountains are equally sized and positioned beside each other creating a very static and uninteresting image. In image B the mountains are differently sized and one is placed closer to the horizon, guiding the eye to move from one mountain to the other creating a more interesting and pleasing image. This also feels more natural because in nature objects are rarely the same size and evenly spaced.

===Other techniques===
* There should be a center of interest or focus in the work, to prevent it becoming a pattern in itself
* The direction followed by the viewer's eye should lead the viewer's gaze around all elements in the work before leading out of the picture
* The subject should not be facing out of the image
* Exact bisections of the picture space should be avoided
* Small, high contrast, elements have as much impact as larger, duller elements
* The prominent subject should be off-centre, unless a symmetrical or formal composition is desired, and can be balanced by smaller satellite elements
* The horizon line should not divide the art work in two equal parts but be positioned to emphasize either the sky or ground; showing more sky if painting is of clouds, sun rise/set, and more ground if a landscape
*Use of detailed areas and 'rest' areas can help to aid the eye in where to look. Creating a contrast between detail and lack of detail is important
These principles ''can'' be means of a good composition yet they ''cannot'' be applied separately but should act together to form a good composition.
*Also in an artwork, it is suggested that no spaces between the objects should be the same to create a more interesting image.

==Example==
These paintings all show the same subject, the [[Raising of Lazarus]], and essentially the same figures, but have very different compositions:

'''Depiction''' is reference conveyed through pictures. Basically a picture refers to its object through a non-linguistic two-dimensional scheme. A picture is not writing or notation. A depictive two-dimensional scheme is called a [[picture plane]] and may be constructed according to [[descriptive geometry]] where they are usually divided between ''projections'' (orthogonal and various oblique angles) and ''perspectives'' (according to number of vanishing points). Pictures are made with various materials and techniques, such as painting, drawing, or prints (including photography and movies) mosaics, tapestries, stained glass, and collages of unusual and disparate elements. Occasionally, picture-like features may be recognised in simple inkblots, accidental stains, peculiar clouds or a glimpse of the moon, but these are special cases, and it is controversial whether they count as genuine instances of depiction.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Robert Hopkins (1998), "Picture, Image, Experience" (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, sculpture and theatrical performances are sometimes said to depict, but this requires a broad understanding of 'depict', as simply designating a form of representation that is not linguistic or notational. The bulk of studies of depiction however deal only with pictures. While sculpture and performance clearly represent or refer, they do not strictly picture their objects. 
 
Objects pictured may be factual or fictional, literal or metaphorical, realistic or idealised and in various combination. Idealised depiction is also termed schematic or stylised and extends to icons, diagrams and maps. Classes or styles of picture may abstract their objects by degrees, conversely, establish degrees of the concrete (usually called, a little confusingly, figuration or figurative, since the 'figurative' is then often quite literal). Stylisation can lead to the fully abstract picture, where reference is only to conditions for a picture plane – a severe exercise in self-reference and ultimately a sub-set of pattern.

But just ''how'' pictures function remains controversial. Philosophers, art historians and critics, perceptual psychologists and other researchers in the arts and social sciences have contributed to the debate and many of the most influential contributions have been interdisciplinary. Some key positions are briefly surveyed below.

== Resemblance ==

Traditionally, depiction is distinguished from denotative meaning by the presence of a [[mimesis|mimetic]] element or resemblance. A picture resembles its object in a way a word or sound does not. Resemblance is no guarantee of depiction, obviously. Two pens may resemble one another but do not therefore depict each other. To say a picture resembles its object especially is only to say that its object is that which it especially resembles; which strictly begins with the picture itself. Indeed, since everything resembles something in some way, mere resemblance as a distinguishing trait is trivial. Moreover, depiction is no guarantee of resemblance to an object. A picture of a dragon does not resemble an actual dragon. So resemblance is not enough.

Theories have tried either to set further conditions to the kind of resemblance necessary, or sought ways in which a notational system might allow such resemblance. It is widely believed that the problem with a resemblance theory of depiction is that resemblance is a symmetrical relation between terms (necessarily, if x resembles y, then y resembles x) while in contrast depiction is at best a non-symmetrical relation (it is not necessary that, if x depicts y, y depicts x). If this is right, then depiction and resemblance cannot be identified, and a resemblance theory of depiction is forced to offer a more complicated explanation, for example by relying on experienced resemblance instead, which clearly is an asymmetrical notion (that you experience x as resembling y does not mean you also experience y as resembling x).&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Hopkins (1998), Christopher Peacocke (1987) 'Depiction', in Philosophical Review 96(3):383-410.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued, however, that the concept of resemblance is not exclusively a relational notion, and so that the initial problem is merely apparent.&lt;ref&gt;John Hyman (2012), 'Depiction', in Royal Institute of Philosophy Supplement 71:129-150.&lt;/ref&gt;

In art history, the history of actual attempts to achieve resemblance in depictions is usually covered under the terms "[[realism (arts)|realism]]", [[Naturalism (visual art)|naturalism]]", or "[[illusionism]]".

== Illusion ==

The most famous and elaborate case for resemblance modified by reference, is made by art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1960) ''Art and Illusion'' (Oxford: Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1963) Meditations on a Hobbyhorse (Oxford, Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. ''The Image and the Eye'' (Oxford and New York: Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Resemblance in pictures is taken to involve illusion. Instincts in [[visual perception]] are said to be triggered or alerted by pictures, even when we are rarely deceived. The eye supposedly cannot resist finding resemblances that accord with illusion. Resemblance is thus narrowed to something like the seeds of illusion. Against the one-way relation of reference Gombrich argues for a weaker or labile relation, inherited from [[:wikt:substitution|substitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1960): pp 80-98, (1982): pp 278–297.&lt;/ref&gt; Pictures are thus both more primitive and powerful than stricter reference.

But whether a picture can deceive a little while it represents as much seems gravely compromised. Claims for innate dispositions in sight are also contested. Gombrich appeals to an array of psychological research from [[James J. Gibson]], R. L. Gregory, John M. Kennedy, Konrad Lorenz, Ulric Neisser and others in arguing for an 'optical' basis to perspective, in particular (see also [[perspective (graphical)]]. Subsequent cross-cultural studies in depictive competence and related studies in child-development and vision impairment are inconclusive at best.

Gombrich's convictions have important implications for his popular history of art,&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1995), The Story Of Art 16th ed. (London: Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt; for treatment and priorities there. In a later study by John Willats (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Willats, John, (1997), ''Art and Representation: New Principles In The Analysis Of Pictures'' (Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press.)&lt;/ref&gt; on the variety and development of picture planes, Gombrich's views on the greater realism of perspective underpin many crucial findings.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (1995), pp. 133, 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dual invariants ==

A more frankly behaviouristic view is taken by the perceptual psychologist [[James J. Gibson]],&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, James J., 'The Ecological approach to Visual Perception in Pictures' Leonardo, 1978, 11, p.231.&lt;/ref&gt; partly in response to Gombrich. Gibson treats visual perception as the eye registering necessary information for behaviour in a given environment. The information is filtered from light rays that meet the retina. The light is called the stimulus energy or sensation. The information consists of underlying patterns or 'invariants' for vital features to the environment.

Gibson's view of depiction concerns the re-presentation of these invariants. In the case of illusions or trompe l'oeil, the picture also conveys the stimulus energy, but generally the experience is of perceiving two sets of invariants, one for the picture surface, another for the object pictured. He pointedly rejects any seeds of illusion or substitution and allows that a picture represents when two sets of invariants are displayed. But invariants tell us little more than that the resemblance is visible, dual invariants only that the terms of reference are the same as those for resemblance

== Seeing-in ==

A similar duality is proposed by the philosopher of art [[Richard Wollheim]]. He calls it 'twofoldness'.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim, Richard (1987), ''Painting as an Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson) pp 46-7, 72-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Our experience of the picture surface is called the 'configurational' aspect, and our experience of the object depicted the 'recognitional'. Wollheim's main claim is that we are simultaneously aware of both the surface and the depicted object. The concept of twofoldness has been very influential in contemporary analytic aesthetics, especially in the writings of [[Dominic Lopes]]&lt;ref&gt;Lopes, Dominic (2005), Sight and Sensibility: Evaluating Pictures (Oxford: Clarendon Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Bence Nanay]].&lt;ref&gt;Nanay, Bence (2005), 'Is Twofoldness Necessary for Representational Seeing?', British Journal of Aesthetics 45(3): 263-272.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, illusion is forestalled by the prominence of the picture surface where an object is depicted. Yet the object depicted quite simply ''is'' the picture surface under one reading, the surface indifferent to picture, another. The two are hardly compatible or simultaneous. Nor do they ensure a reference relation.

Wollheim introduces the concept of 'seeing-in' to qualify depictive resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim (1987), pp. 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing-in is a psychological disposition to detect a resemblance between certain surfaces, such as inkblots or accidental stains, etc. and three-dimensional objects. The eye is not deceived, but finds or projects some resemblance to the surface. This is not quite depiction, since the resemblance is only incidental to the surface. The surface does not strictly refer to such objects. Seeing-in is a necessary condition to depiction, and sufficient when in accordance with the maker's intentions, where these are clear from certain features to a picture. But seeing-in cannot really say in what way such surfaces resemble objects either, only specify where they perhaps first occur.

Wollheim's account of how a resemblance is agreed or modified, whereby maker and user anticipate each other's roles, does not really explain how a resemblance refers, but rather when an agreed resemblance obtains.

== Other psychological resources ==

The appeal to broader psychological factors in qualifying depictive resemblance is echoed in the theories of philosophers such as Robert Hopkins,&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Robert (1998), Picture, Image, and Experience (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Flint Schier&lt;ref&gt;Schier, Flint (1986), Deeper Into Pictures (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kendall Walton]].&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall (1990), Mimesis as Make-believe (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; They enlist 'experience', 'recognition' and 'imagination' respectively. Each provides additional factors to an understanding or interpretation of pictorial reference, although none can explain how a picture resembles an object (if indeed it does), nor how this resemblance is then also a reference.

For example, Schier returns to the contrast with language to try to identify a crucial difference in depictive competence. Understanding a pictorial style does not depend upon learning a vocabulary and syntax. Once grasped, a style allows the recognition of any object known to the user. Of course recognition allows a great deal more than that – books teaching children to read often introduce them to many exotic creatures such as a kangaroo or armadillo through illustrations. Many fictions and caricatures are promptly recognised without prior acquaintance of either a particular style or the object in question.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Stephanie (1971), 'Caricature', The Monist 58: pp 285-93.&lt;/ref&gt; So competence cannot rely on a simple index or synonymy for objects and styles.

Schier's conclusion that lack of syntax and semantics in reference then qualifies as depiction, leaves dance, architecture, animation, sculpture and music all sharing the same mode of reference. This perhaps points as much to limitations in a linguistic model.

== Notation ==
Reversing orthodoxy, the philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]]&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Nelson (1968), Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols (Indianapolis and New York: The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Inc.).&lt;/ref&gt; starts from reference and attempts to assimilate resemblance. He denies resemblance as either necessary or sufficient condition for depiction but surprisingly, allows that it arises and fluctuates as a matter of usage or familiarity.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (1968), pp. 16-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Goodman, a picture denotes. Denotation is divided between description, covering writing and extending to more discursive notation including music and dance scores, to depiction at greatest remove. However, a word does not grow to resemble its object, no matter how familiar or preferred. To explain how a pictorial notation does, Goodman proposes an analogue system, consisting of undifferentiated characters, a density of syntax and semantics and relative repleteness of syntax. These requirements taken in combination mean that a one-way reference running from picture to object encounters a problem. If its semantics is undifferentiated, then the relation flows back from object to picture. Depiction can acquire resemblance but must surrender reference. This is a point tacitly acknowledged by Goodman, conceding firstly that density is the antithesis of notation&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (1968), p.&amp;nbsp;160.&lt;/ref&gt; and later that lack of differentiation may actually permit resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Nelson and Elgin, Catherine Z, (1988) Reconceptions in Philosophy (London and New York: Routledge) p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; A denotation without notation lacks sense.

Nevertheless, Goodman's framework is revisited by philosopher John Kulvicki&lt;ref&gt;Kulvicki, John (2006), On Images: Their structure and content (Oxford: Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and applied by art historian James Elkins&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James (1999), The Domain of Images (Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; to an array of hybrid artefacts, combining picture, pattern and notation.

== Pictorial semiotics ==

Pictorial [[semiotics]] aims for just the kind of integration of depiction with notation undertaken by Goodman, but fails to identify his requirements for syntax and semantics. It seeks to apply the model of structural linguistics, to reveal core meanings and permutations for pictures of all kinds, but stalls in identifying constituent elements of reference, or as semioticians prefer, 'signification'. Similarly, they accept resemblance although call it 'iconicity' (after [[Charles Sanders Peirce]],&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, Charles Sanders - (1931-58), Collected Papers I-VIII. Hartshorne, C, Weiss, P, &amp; Burks, A, (eds.) (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; 1931–58) and are uncomfortable in qualifying its role. Older practitioners, such as [[Roland Barthes]]&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, Roland (1969), Elements of semiology (Paris, 1967) translated by Annette Lavers and Colin Smith, (London: Cape).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Umberto Eco]]&lt;ref&gt;Eco, Umberto (1980), A Theory of Semiotics (Milan 1976) (Bloomington: Indiana University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; variously shift analysis to underlying 'connotations' for an object depicted or concentrate on description of purported content at the expense of more medium-specific meaning. Essentially they establish a more general [[iconography]].

A later adherent, Göran Sonesson,&lt;ref&gt;Sonesson, Göran (1989), Pictorial Concepts: Inquiries into the semiotic heritage and its relevance for the analysis of the visual world. (Lund: Aris/Lund University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sonesson, Göran (2001), 'Iconicity strikes back: the third generation – or why Eco is still wrong'. VISIO 9: 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; rejects Goodman's terms for syntax and semantics as alien to linguistics, no more than an ideal and turns instead to the findings of perceptual psychologists, such as J. M. Kennedy,&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, John M. (1974) The Psychology of Picture Perception (San Francisco, Jossey-Bass).&lt;/ref&gt; N. H. Freeman&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, N. H. and Cox, M. V. (eds.) (1985), Visual Order: The Nature and Development of Pictorial Representation (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, N. H., Evans, D., and Willats, J. (1988) Symposium overview: the computational approach to projection drawing-systems. (Budapest, Paper given at Third European Conference on Developmental Psychology).&lt;/ref&gt; and David Marr&lt;ref&gt;Marr, David (1977), 'Analysis of occluding outline', Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B 197 441-475.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marr, David (1978), 'Representing visual information: a computational approach.' in Computer Vision, A. R. Hanson and E. M. Riseman (eds.) Academic Press, New York and London, pp. 61-80.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to detect underlying structure. Sonesson accepts 'seeing-in',&lt;ref&gt;Sonesson, Göran (Revised August 2006), 'Current issues in pictorial semiotics. Lecture three: From the Critique of the Iconicity Critique to Pictorality' . Third conference of a series published online at the Semiotics Institute Online. January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; although prefers Edmund Husserl's version.&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund (1928), Zur Phänomenologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins. Halle. (Republished in Husserliana X, The Hague: Nijhoff, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund (1980), Phantasie, Bildbewusstsein, Erinnerung, Husserliana XXIII. (The Hague: Nijhoff).&lt;/ref&gt; Resemblance is again grounded in optics or the visible, although this does not exclude writing nor reconcile resemblance with reference. Discussion tends to be restricted to the function of outlines in schemes for depth.

==Deixis==
The art historian [[Norman Bryson]]&lt;ref&gt;Bryson, Norman (1983) Vision and Painting: The Logic of The Gaz, (New Haven and London: Yale University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; persists with a linguistic model and advances a detail of parsing and tense, '[[deixis]]'. He rejects resemblance and illusion as incompatible with the ambiguities and interpretation available to pictures and is also critical of the inflexible nature of structuralist analysis. Deixis is taken as the rhetoric of the narrator, indicating the presence of the speaker in a discourse, a bodily or physical aspect as well as an explicit temporal dimension. In depiction this translates as a difference between 'The [[Gaze]]' where deixis is absent and 'The Glance' where it is present. Where present, details to materials indicate how long and in what way the depiction was made, where absent, a telling suppression or prolonging of the act. The distinction attempts to account for the 'plastic' or medium-specific qualities absent from earlier semiotic analyses and somewhat approximates the 'indexic' aspect to [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#Icon, index, symbol|signs introduced by Peirce]].

Deixis offers a more elaborate account of the picture surface and broad differences to expression and application but cannot qualify resemblance.

==Iconography==
Lastly, iconography is the study of pictorial content, mainly in art, and would seem to ignore the question of how to concentrate upon what. But iconography's findings take a rather recondite view of content, are often based on subtle literary, historical and cultural allusion and highlight a sharp difference in terms of resemblance, optical accuracy or intuitive illusion. Resemblance is hardly direct or spontaneous for the iconographer, reference rarely to the literal or singular. Visual perception here is subject to reflection and research, the object as much reference as referent.

The distinguished art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]]&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, Erwin (1955) Meaning in the Visual Arts (New York: Doubleday).&lt;/ref&gt; allowed three levels to iconography. The first is 'natural' content, the object recognised or resembling without context, on a second level, a modifying historical and cultural context and at a third, deeper level, a fundamental structure or ideology (called iconology). He even ascribed the use of perspective a deep social meaning (1927). However more recently, a natural or neutral level tends to be abandoned as mythical. The cultural scholar [[W. J. T. Mitchell]]&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, W. J. T. (1980), The Language of Images (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, W. J. T. (1986), Iconology: Image, Text, Ideology, (Chicago and London: University Of Chicago Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, W. J. T. (1994), Picture Theory (Chicago and London: University Of Chicago Press).&lt;/ref&gt; looks to ideology to determine resemblance and depiction as acknowledgement of shifts in relations there, albeit by an unspecified scheme or notation.

Iconography points to differences in scope for a theory of depiction. Where stylistics and a basic object is nominated, resemblance is prominent, but where more elaborate objects are encountered, or terms for nature denied, simple perception or notation flounder. The difference corresponds somewhat to the division in philosophy between the analytic and continental.

==Other issues==
Dozens of factors influence depictions and how they are represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomson|first=T. J.|last2=Greenwood|first2=Keith|date=2016-03-08|title=Beyond Framing|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17512786.2016.1152908|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/17512786.2016.1152908|issn=1751-2786}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the equipment used to create the depiction, the creator’s intent, vantage point, mobility, proximity, publication format, among others, and, when dealing with human subjects, their potential desire for impression management.

Other debates about the nature of depiction include the relationship between seeing something in a picture and seeing face to face, whether depictive representation is [[Convention (norm)|conventional]], how understanding novel depictions is possible, the [[aesthetic]] and [[ethical]] value of depiction and the nature of [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] in pictorial [[art]].

[[Image:Hermes 16 illustration1.png|thumb|The Duenos inscription, as recorded by [[Heinrich Dressel]].]]

The '''Duenos inscription''' is one of the earliest known [[Old Latin]] texts, variously dated from the 7th to the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Osvaldo Sacchi, "Il trivaso del Quirinale", in ''Revue Interantionale de Droit de l'Antiquité'', 2001, p. 277; citing: Attilio Degrassi, ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Liberae Rei Publicae]]'', 1, 1957; Arthur Gordon, "Notes on the Duenos-Vase Inscription in Berlin", ''California Studies in Classical Antiquity'', Vol. 8, 1975, pp.&amp;nbsp;53–72; Giovanni Colonna, "Duenos", in ''Studi Etruschi'', '''47''', 1979, pp. 163–172; Brent Vine, [http://www.pies.ucla.edu/IESV/1/BV_Duenos.pdf "A Note on the Duenos Inscription"], [[University of California at Los Angeles]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is inscribed on the sides of a ''[[kernos]]'', in this case a trio of small globular vases adjoined by three clay struts. It was found by [[Heinrich Dressel]] in 1880 on the [[Quirinal Hill]] in [[Rome]]. The ''kernos'' belongs to the [[Staatliche Museen]] in [[Berlin]] (inventory no. 30894,3).

The inscription is written [[Right-to-left|right to left]] in three units, without spaces to separate words. It is difficult to translate, as some letters are hard to distinguish, particularly since they cannot always be deduced by context. The absence of spaces causes additional difficulty in assigning the letters to the respective words.

==Text and translations==

There have been many proposed translations advanced by scholars since the discovery of the ''kernos''; by 1983, more than fifty different explanations of the meaning had been put forward.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur E. Gordon, ''Illustrated Introduction to Latin Epigraphy'', 1983, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of a large body of archaic Latin, and the method by which [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] abbreviated their inscriptions, scholars have not been able to produce a singular translation that has been accepted by historians as accurate. However thanks to Arthur E. Gordon's work the reading of the text can be now considered certain.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur E. Gordon, "Note on the Duenos Vase inscription in Berlin", in ''California Studies in Classical Antiquity'', '''8''', 1976, pp. 53 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Contradict-inline|reason=There's no translation considered accurate, but this one person's translation is accepted as certain?|date=April 2018}}

Below is the transcription and one of many possible interpretations:&lt;ref&gt;S. Warmington, 54 ff.; and H. Eichner, in: ''Die Sprache'', 34, 1988-1990, 207 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
:a. The direct [[unicase]] transcription
:b. Direct transcription, in lowercase, with possible [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]s and word breaks
:c. A speculative interpretation and translation into [[Classical Latin]]
:d. An English gloss (approximate translation/interpretation) of the Classical Latin rendering

'''Line 1:'''
:a. {{sc2|IOVESATDEIVOSQOIMEDMITATNEITEDENDOCOSMISVIRCOSIED}}
:b. ''iouesāt deivos qoi mēd mitāt, nei tēd endō cosmis vircō siēd''
:c. ''Iurat deos qui me mittit, ni in te'' [= ''erga te''] ''comis virgo sit''
:d. 'The person who sends me prays to the gods, lest the girl be not kind towards thee'

'''Line 2:'''
:a. {{sc2|ASTEDNOISIOPETOITESIAIPAKARIVOIS}}
:b. ''as(t) tēd noisi o(p)petoit esiāi pākā riuois''
:c. ''at te'' [... uncertain ...] ''paca rivis''
:d. 'without thee [...] calm with [these] rivers'

'''Line 3:'''
:a. {{sc2|DVENOSMEDFECEDENMANOMEINOMDVENOINEMEDMALOSTATOD}}
:b. ''duenos mēd fēced en mānōm einom duenōi nē mēd malo(s) statōd''
:c. ''Bonus me fecit in manum einom bono, ne me malus [tollito, clepito]''
:d. 'A good man made me in his own[?] hands for a good man, in case an evil man take me.'

An interpretation set out by Warmington and Eichner, renders the complete translation as follows, though not with certainty:
#It is sworn with the gods, whence I'm issued:&lt;br /&gt;If a maiden does not smile at you,
#nor is strongly attracted to you,&lt;br /&gt;then soothe her with this fragrance!

''Duenos'' is an older form of Classical Latin {{Lang|la|bonus}} ('good'), just as Classical {{Lang|la|[[Polemos|bellum]]}} ('war') is from Old Latin ''duellum''. Some scholars{{who|date=April 2018}} posit Duenos as a proper name, instead of merely an adjective.

The [[Praeneste fibula|Praenestine fibula]] is thought by some to be the earliest surviving evidence of the Latin language dating to the 7th century BC, but has been alleged by [[Margherita Guarducci]] to have been a well-informed hoax; however, the evidence is only circumstantial and there are no clear indications pointing to a forgery. Although these claims have been disproven, as a new analysis performed in 2011 declared it to be genuine "beyond any reasonable doubt".&lt;ref name="maras"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Daniele F. |last=Maras |title=Scientists declare the Fibula Praenestina and its inscription to be genuine 'beyond any reasonable doubt' |url= http://ancientstudies.fas.nyu.edu/docs/CP/963/EtruscanNewsVol14_2012_winter.pdf |journal=Etruscan News |volume=14 |date=Winter 2012 |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120224195235/http://ancientstudies.fas.nyu.edu/docs/CP/963/EtruscanNewsVol14_2012_winter.pdf |archive-date=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epigraphic note==
The inscription (CIL I 2nd  2, 4) is scratched along the side of the body of three vases made of dark brown ''bucchero'', connected with each other by short cylindric arms. It is written from right to left spiralling downwards about {{frac|1|1|2}} times. The letters are written upside-down for a reader who looks at the inscription from a level position; this has been explained by Aldo Luigi Prosdocimi&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Luigi Prosdocimi, "Studi sul latino arcaico", in ''Studi Etruschi'', '''47''', 1979, pp. 173–221.&lt;/ref&gt; as due to the fact that the inscription was meant to be read from above, not from a sideways position. Some letters are written in an archaic fashion that appears influenced by the [[Greek alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;J. E. Sandys, S. G. Campbell, ''Latin Epigraphy: an Introduction to the study of Latin Inscriptions'' 1974, p. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; There are signs of corrections in the two {{sc2|C}} or {{sc2|K}} of {{sc2|PAKARI}} and {{sc2|FECED}} and in the {{sc2|L}} of {{sc2|MALOS}}. Three distinct sections are individuated by spaces after {{sc2|SIED}} and {{sc2|VOIS}}. There are neither spaces delimiting words nor signs of interpunction. The earliest interpunction to appear was syllabic. As it  appeared only in the 7th century BC, the inscription should be more ancient.&lt;ref&gt;Giuliano and Larissa Bonfante ''Lingua e cultura degli Etruschi'' Torino, 1985, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription is made up by two distinct parts or sections, the second one beginning with the word {{sc2|DUENOS}}.&lt;ref&gt;E. Dressel "Di una antichissima iscrizione latina graffita sopra un vaso votivo rinvenuta a Roma" in ''Annali dell' Istituto di Corrispondenza Archeologica'' '''52''', 1880, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was found in a votive deposit (''favissa''). It belongs to the kind known as ''speaking inscriptions'', widely in use in the [[Classical antiquity#Archaic period .28c.8th to c.6th centuries BC.29|Archaic period]]. Some scholars consider the object to be of good quality and reflecting the high social status of the owner. Others consider it common.

==Site of the find==
{{hatnote|The following sections are mainly based on Osvaldo Sacchi's 2001 article "Il trivaso del Quirinale".&lt;ref&gt;Osvaldo Sacchi, "Il trivaso del Quirinale", in ''Revue Interantionale de Droit de l'Antiquité'', 2001, pp. 277–344.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The vase was bought from an [[antiquarian]] by [[Heinrich Dressel]] shortly after its find. It was discovered in 1880 by workers who were digging to lay the foundation of a building near the newly opened [[Via Nazionale (Rome)|Via Nazionale]], in the valley between the [[Quirinal Hill]] and the [[Viminal Hill]]. More precisely it was found on the south slope of the Quirinal, near the church of [[San Vitale, Rome]]. Dressel was told the place was supposed to have been a burial site.&lt;ref&gt;Bréal; Gordon.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archeologist [[Filippo Coarelli]] has advanced the hypothesis that the object might have been placed in the votive deposit of one of the temples of goddess [[Fortuna]] dedicated by king  [[Servius Tullius]], perhaps the one known as ''Fortuna Publica'' or '' Citerior'', i.e. located on the side of the Quirinal near to Rome. Her festival recurred on the ''nonae'' of April (April 5).&lt;ref&gt;Filippo Coarelli ''Il Foro Boario'' p. 289 ff.; Plutarch ''Quaest. Romanae'' 74 and ''De Fortuna Romana'' 10&lt;/ref&gt; However June 11, the festival day of the [[Matralia]], which was originally devoted to ''Mater Matuta'', was also the day of the ''Fortuna Virgo'', ritually associated with the passage of girls from adolescence into adulthood and married life.&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' II 67; Aurelius Augustinus ''De Civitate Dei'' IV 11; Ovid ''Fasti'' VI 221; [[Mario Torelli]] ''Lavinio e Roma. Riti iniziatici tra archeologia e storia'' 1984, p. 53 ff. and 117 ff.; [[Giovanni Colonna (archaeologist)|Giovanni Colonna]] "Duenos" in ''Studi Etruschi'' '''47''' (1979) p. 168; [[Robert E. A. Palmer]] "Roman shrines of female chastity from the struggle of chastity to the papacy of Innocent I" in ''Rivista Storica dell'Antichità'' '''4'''  (1974) p. 129 ff. (also available as a monograph from the publisher Pàtron) who thinks the sanctuary of the votive deposit should be that of a Fortuna [[Bona Dea]] much more ancient than the Εύελπις and of purely Roman tradition. [[Kurt Latte]] ''Römische Religionsgeschichte'' Munich, 1960, p. 228 ff. excludes the name of Bona Dea as a translation of a Greek theonym.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of the linguistic research==
The antiquity of the document is generally acknowledged. The language shows archaic characters in morphology, phonetics and syntax. The absence of ''u'' after ''q'' would testify to its  greater antiquity comparatively to the inscription of the ''cippus'' of the [[Roman Forum|Forum]], also known as [[Lapis Niger]] (CIL I 1).&lt;ref&gt;G. Pennisi "Il tri-vaso di Duenos" in  ''Studi Latini e Italiani'' 1992 p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First section===
For the sake of convenience of interpretation, the text is usually divided into two sections, the first one containing  the first two units and ending with {{sc2|PAKARIVOIS}}. The two sections show a relative syntactic and semantic independence.

Many attempts have been made at deciphering the text.

In the 1950s the inscription had been interpreted mainly on the basis of (and in relation to) the supposed function of the vases, considered either as containers for a love philter or of beauty products: the text would then mockingly threaten the owner about his behaviour towards the vase itself or try to attract a potential buyer.&lt;ref&gt;Emilio Peruzzi "L'iscrizione di Duenos " in ''La Parola del Passato'' '''13''' (1958) p. 328 ff.: the author supposes the object is a love toy and the inscription would be a playful warning to the owner not turn down the object itself, i.e. "he who turns me upside down  (''mitat'') prays the gods that the girl should not give you her favours lest you want to be satisfied through the  workings of ''Tuteria''": Tuteria would then be a proper name  and the object the work of an enchantress that exercised her magic art to get the lost lover back for a female customer of hers; E. Gjerstad "The Duenos vase" in ''Kung. Vitt. och Antikvitets Akademiens Handlingen'' (1959)  pp. 133–143 supposed the object were a container for beauty products and interpreted the text as: "''Iurat deos qui me mittit: 'Ne in te comis virgo sit asted, nisi ope utens ei pacari vis'. Bonus me fecit in bonum atque bono, ne me malus dato!''" , i.e. " 'Thy girl shall not be amiable to thee, unless thou befriend her by using (my) assistance' Good man has made me for a good purpose and for the benefit of a good man; may not a bad man present me!"&lt;/ref&gt; This is the so-called erotic line of interpretation which found supporters until the eighties.&lt;ref&gt;Filippo Coarelli, ''Il Foro Boario'', 1988, p. 289 ff. Tuteria = Tutela would be a theonym, i.e. one of the many personifications of Fortuna, perhaps the Τύχη Εύελπις of the ''vicus Longus'': the meaning of the text would be that of a girl forced to be complacent for the effect of the moderating intervention of a deity in whose sanctuary the vase was dedicated. T. Bolelli. "De antiquissima inscriptione quae Dueni nuncupatur annotationes", in Cipriano, Di Giovine, and Mancini (eds.) ''Miscellanea di studi linguistici in onore di W. Belardi''. '''1''' (1984) pp. 207–214: "Swears for the gods he who sells me that, if the girl is not nice towards you, at least she shall remain with you (i.e. you shall not lose her) lest you want make peace (with her) through the workings of Tuteria (an enchantress)."&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s [[Georges Dumézil]] proposed a new line of thought in the interpreting of the text. He remarked the inconsistency of the previous interpretations both with the solemnity of the opening  formula ("''Iovesat deivos qoi med mitat''": 'He swears for the gods who sends /delivers me') and with the site of the find. Dumézil's interpretation was: "If it happens that the girl is not nice to you/ has no easy relationship with you ("''nei ted endo cosmis virco sied''" = "''ne in te (=erga te) cosmis virgo sit''"), we shall have the obligation of bringing  her and you into good harmony, accord, agreement ("''asted noisi ... pakari vois''"="''at sit nobis ... pacari vobis''"). The transmission of the object would be expressed by the words ''qoi med mitat''. The story mirrored in the text would thus depict a custom deeply rooted in Roman society that is described by [[Plautus]] in the scene of the [[Menaechmi]] in which the ''tutor'' of the ''virgo'' or his representatives formally give a suretyship about her attitude towards a man.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Dumézil]], "La deuxième ligne de l' "inscription de Duenos" in ''Latomus'' '''102''' 1969, pp. 244-255; id. ''Idées romaines'', Paris, 1969, pp. 12–28; It. tr. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In fact this line of interpretation, based on the reading of ''toiteisai'' as related to ''tutela'' (ward, guardianship) either as a noun (''ope  tutelae'') or an adjective ''tuteria'' (''ope tuteria = ope tutoria''), had already been proposed in 1934 by philologist and literary critic Antonino Pagliaro, who interpreted the segment {{sc2|ASTEDNOISI...PAKARIVOIS}} as meaning: 'unless [''noisi'' = ''nisi''] you will [''vois'' from ''volo'' 'I want'] consider yourself satisfied by the exercise of the marital ''potestas''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'. He understood ''ope tuteria'' as referring  to the ''potestas'' exercised by the husband through the ''manus maritalis'', which would be equated to a sort of ward, ''tutela''. Cf. "La cosiddetta iscrizione di Dueno" in ''Atene e Roma'' '''3''':2, 1934, pp. 162–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumézil's interpretation though was fraught with linguistic problems. Apart from the value of the {{sc2|I}} before {{sc2|OPE}}, which he considered meaningless or an error of the incisor, the only possible meaning of ''ope'' in Latin is 'by the power or force of', and it governs a word in the genitive case. Thence the only governing word could be the group {{sc2|TOITESIAI}}: this would then be an exception to the rule of the genitive of the themes in ''-a'', which does not end in ''-as'' as expected, an archaism perhaps in Dumézil's view. {{sc2|TOITEISIAI}} would then denote the means by which the ''nois(i)'', 'we', would have the authority of establishing peace between the 'vois' 'you' (the couple) of the main relationship justifying the delivery of the vase.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Georges Dumézil, ''Idées romaines'' p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil thinks of the involvement of more than one ''tutor'' for each party in order to explain the two plurals ''nois(i)'' and ''vois''. Lastly the ending {{sc|ESIAI}} presents difficulties. It might derive from an archaic ''-e-s-la'' as proposed by H. Osthoff in the formation of Latin abstract names&lt;ref&gt;H. Osthoff, "Die Suffixform ''-sla-'' vornehmlich im Germanischen", in ''Paul und Braunes Beitrage'' '''3''', (1876) pp. 335–347, partic. p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; with an assimilation of the liquid into an ''i''. Another possibility would be to interpret the suffix ''-ela'' as ''-e-la'', i.e. as a female derivation of an ancient neuter ''-el'' attested in Hittite.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Émile Benveniste]], ''Origine de la formation de noms en indoeuropéen'', Paris, 1962–1966, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; This would entail admitting the incisor made two errors.

Antonino Pagliaro understood the word {{sc2|TOITESIAI}} as an adjective from noun ''tutela'', ''ope tuteria'', i.e. ''ope tutoria'' in classical Latin: the word would thence be an attribute in the ablative.&lt;ref&gt;Antonino Pagliaro, above, pp. 162 ff.; cf. above note.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumézil's contribution and the location of the find gave researchers grounds to pursue their work of interpretation in the  same direction, i.e. of its significance as a token of legal obligation. The efforts have centred on deciphering of the last segment of the first section, {{sc2|ASTED...PAKARIVOIS}}.

As already mentioned above, the cult of ''Fortuna Virgo'', celebrated on the day of the [[Matralia]], was related to the role of girls who became married women. The passage saw girls as completely passive subjects both during the archaic period and great part of the republican: the matrimonial exchange was conducted, as far as legally relevant profiles were concerned, by the subjects who had ''potestas'' on the woman and by the future husband (or he/those who had ''potestas'' over him). This is testified by the fact the ''virgo'' had no right of pronouncing  the ''nupta verba''.&lt;ref&gt;Festus s.v. ''Nupta verba'', p. 174 L; Paulus exc. Festi s.v. ''Nupta verba'', p. 175 L.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Colonna, ''Duenos'', in SE 1979, p. 168; R. E. A. Palmer, 1974, p. 129 ff.; K. Latte, p. 228 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage which presents the greatest difficulties is the central group of letters {{sc2|IOPETOITESIAI}} in the string {{sc2|ASTED...VOIS}}. Proposed interpretations include: ''iubet'' orders for {{sc2|IOPET}}; ''futuitioni'' sexual intercourse for {{sc2|IOPETOI}},&lt;ref&gt;Vittore Pisani ''Manuale storico della lingua latina'' Torino, 1948-1950, p. 9: the tutors would guarantee the sexual disponibility/acquiescence of the girl.&lt;/ref&gt; the cut {{sc2|TOI}}/{{sc2|TESIAI}} or {{sc2|OITES}}/{{sc2|IAI}} so that {{sc2|OPE}} would be the only recognisable Latin word.

Dumézil attributes a peculiar semantic value to the syllabic group {{sc2|TOITESIAI}}: a moral instrument that is nothing else than a form of the power the males of a family group (father, tutors) exercised on a girl, i.e. a variant or alteration of the word ''tutelae'', similar to ''tu(i)tela''. Since this interpretation has been proposed no critic has been able to disprove it. Authoritative scholars on the grounds of the lexeme ''toitesiai'' have proposed a theonym (Coarelli), a feminine proper name Tuteria (Peruzzi, Bolelli), or even a ''gentilicium'', the gens Titur(n)ia (Simon and Elboj) mentioned by Cicero.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''Ad Famil.'' XIII 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, two further contributions have discussed once again the interpretation of the second part of the first grapheme, particularly morpheme ''toitesiai''. Even though doubts have been cast over its correspondence with the technical Roman legal word ''tutela'', Dumézil intuition of recognising in the destination of the vase a juridical function, namely a matrimonial ''sponsio'', was accepted and taken on.

G. Pennisi &lt;ref&gt;G. Pennisi, "Il tri-vaso di Duenos", in ''Studi Latini e Italiani'', 1992, p. 7–44.&lt;/ref&gt; reconstructs the text as follows: "''Iovesat deivos qoi med mitat: nei ted cosmis virgo sied ast ednoisi opetoi pakari vois. Duenos med feced en manom einom duenoi ne med malos tatod''". Segment {{sc2|EDNOISI}} is deciphered recurring to Homeric έεδνα in the meaning of nuptial gifts and the speaking token would be a marriage compact or promise by a young man in love to a girl to whom the vase is presented as a gift. The inscription would thence exhibit an oath structure consisting in an archaic form of ''[[coemptio]]'': "Swears for the gods he who buys me": ''mitat = *emitat'' (the future bridegroom would be speaking in the third person). Then passing to the second person the compact would be set out in the second line by the offering of the nuptial gifts as a guarantee. The third line would complete the legal formula of the compact (''Duenos / ne med malos tatod'').
Leo Peppe&lt;ref&gt;Leo Peppe, "Storie di parole, storie di istituti sul diritto matrimoniale arcaico", in  ''Studia et Documenta Historiae et Iuris'' 1997, pp. 123 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; has proposed to interpret the inscription as a primitive form of matrimonial ''coemptio'' different from that presented in [[Gaius]], consisting in a cumulative acceptance that included both the legal aspects concerning  the transmission of the dotal assets and the religious ones inherent in the matrimonial cults and rites.

F. Marco Simon and G. Fontana Elboj (autopsy) confirmed the interpretation of the previous proposals that see in the vase the symbol of a marriage compact. The authors ground their  interpretation on the segment {{sc2|OITESIAI}} instead of {{sc2|TOITESIAI}}. They therefore identified a root ''*o-it'' (composed by prefix ''*o'' and [[lexeme]] ''*i-'', cf. Latin  ''eo'') related to classic Latin ''utor'', and suffix ''-esios/a'' (cf. ''Valesios'' of the [[Lapis Satricanus]] and ''Leucesie'' of the [[carmen Saliare]]). The substantive ''oitesiai'' would be thus related to the semantic field of ''utor'' i.e. the concept of ''utilitas''. Therefore, the text should be divided as: ''asted noisi; opet otesiai pakari vois''. ''Opet'' would be an articulatory fusion  between the dative ''opi'' and conjunction ''et''. The whole text should thus be understood as: ''Ni erga te virgo comis sit, asted nobis; (iurat) opi et utilitati pangi vois'', 'if the girl is not to your taste/agreeable to you, let her go back to us; (he swears) to give you guarantee about your disturb and your interest'. The segment ''oitesiai'' could be also understood as ''utensilium'' referred to the vase itself as a token of suretiship or ''[[usus]]'' in the technical legal sense of Roman marriage as a way of providing a guarantee. The last two hypotheses are, however, considered unacceptable by the authors on the grounds that no genitive marker is to be found in the segment ''oitesiai''.&lt;ref&gt;F. Marco Simon and G. Fontana Elboj, "Sponsio matrimonial en la Roma arcaica", in ''Revue International de Droit de l'Antiquité'' '''43''', 1996, pp. 232–234.&lt;/ref&gt;
The proposed interpretation would find support in its strict analogy with a passage of [[Terentius]]'s [[Hecyra]] (vv. 136–151), in which a story similar to that supposedly recorded on  the vase is described. The text would thus be the undertaking of an obligation concerning the eventuality that the girl go back to her family of origin, should she be not liked by the bridegroom (''asted endo cosmis virco sied, asted noisi'').

Even after the last two contributions related above, Sacchi acknowledges that all attempts at interpreting the segment {{sc2|AST...VOIS}} remain conjectural.

Dumézil's hypothesis of a protoform of ''tutela'', though attractive and plausible, remains unconfirmed.

===Juridical note on the matrimonial ''sponsio''===
Although there are still obscure points in the interpretation of line two, it is generally accepted that the text contains the formula of an oath. On the archaic oath and its juridical value there is large agreement among scholars. It looks also probable that the object should have a religious implication: an instrument permeated by religious ritualism, as the oath could well be employed in legal practice at the time of the object, as seems supported by linguistic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Emil Benveniste, ''Le vocabulaire des institutions indoeuropeennes'', Italian translation, 1976, vol. II, pp. 367–375; Giacomo Devoto, "Parole giuridiche", in ''Scritti minori'' I, 1958, p. 100; Osvaldo Sacchi, "Il trivaso del Quirinale", in ''Revue Interantionale de Droit de l'Antiquité'', 2001, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of the oath in archaic times as an instrument of private civil law could have been widespread, even though the issue has not yet been thoroughly analysed.&lt;ref&gt;O. Sacchi, above, p. 302-303; Salvatore Tondo "La semantica di sacramentum nella sfera giudiziale" in ''Studia et Documenta Historiae et iuris'' '''35''', 1969 p. 305 and  337; Francesco Sini ''Documenti sacerdotali di Roma antica'' I. ''Libri e commentari'' Sassari, 1983, p.164; Antonello Calore, ''Per Iovem lapidem'', 2000, p.146; Filippo Cancelli, ''La giuriprudenza unica dei pontefici'', Milano, 1996, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though in the inscription there is no segment directly reminiscent of the dialogic formula of the ''sponsio'', i.e. "''spondes tu ...?''", "''spondeo!''", internal and external evidence allow the assumption of the enactment of a matrimonial ''sponsio''.&lt;ref&gt;''Res sacrae'' were the straight ''tunica'' and the yellow network worn by the bride. Festus s. v. ''spondere'', p. 440 L, derives ''sponsio'' from Greek σπονδάς, i.e. the sacred libation the bride and bridegroom dedicated to the gods.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a usage of oaths is attested in later literary sources.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Naturalis Historia'', XXVIII 27; Servius, ''Ad Georgicas'', I 21; Plautus, ''Cistellaria'' 98; Ovid, ''Epodes'', XXI 133-144; O. Sacchi, above, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the trace of a ''sponsio'' as the legal function of the object, Dumézil would also see that of providing a piece evidence, i.e. a probatory attitude. [[Servius]] in his commentary to the ''Aeneid'' writes that, before the introduction of the matrimonial tablets, in Latium the parties used to exchange tokens of pledge (''symbola'') on which they stated as a promise that they agreed to the marriage and nominated guarantors (''sponsores''). To the same time of the regal period is ascribed the introduction of the Greek use of double scriptures, ''tesserae''.&lt;ref&gt;Servius, ''Aeneis'', X 79: ''Legere furari ... Gremiis abducere pactas id est sponsas: nam ante usum tabularum matrimonii cautiones sibi invicem emittebant, et fideiussores dabant: unde admissum est ut sponsum dicamus virum a spondendo, et sponsam promissam. Ceterum proprie sponderi puallae est: ergo sponsus non quia promittitur, sed quia spondet et sponsores dat. Sane exaggeratio est nimia in quod ait 'gremiis abducere', tamquam iam uxores.'': the allusion to the simulated abduction of the girl reflects a practice attested in rural Latium til the time of the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|social war]] according to Gellius: cf. Paulus ex Festus s.v. ''rapi'', p. 365 L; Simon and  Elboj, above, p. 267; Georges Dumézil, ''Idées romaines'', p. 23; G. Colonna, above, p. 168, n. 4; O. Sacchi, above, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sponsio is one of the most ancient forms of verbal undertaking of obligation and its religious nature is acknowledged, as well as its connection with betrothal.&lt;ref&gt;Arangio-Ruiz, ''Instituciones'', p. 446; W. H. Buckler, ''Obligation in Roman Law'', New York, 1893.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient sources are in agreement that the archaic ''sponsalia'' had a religious nature.&lt;ref&gt;F. Fabbrini, ''Novissimo Digesto Italiano'', '''15''', 1968, p.510, s.v. ''Res divini iuris'' for a review; Festus s.v. spondere, p. 440 L.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brent Vine's study&lt;ref&gt;''A Note on the Duenos Inscription'' 1997&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on the linguistic analysis of the word {{sc2|MITAT}} of the first sentence and of the segment {{sc2|EN()MANOMEINOM}} of the third lends support to such an interpretation: he argues that ''mitat'' would be a form of a frequentative verb ''mitare'' based on a past participle in -''to'' of an IE root ''*meɨ̯'', with the meaning of 'exchange'. Semantically this frequentative should be considered factitive, thence arriving at a verb that would mean 'to cause to be given in exchange', hence 'to give (in exchange)'. Vine's analysis of the segment {{sc2|EN()MANOMEINOM}} fits the hypothesis of an exchange of ''symbola'' equally  well. He argues that a word {{sc2|[M]EINOM}} could be isolated on the grounds of the single spelling of geminates which is considered normal by linguists for the archaic period. This he proposes to understand as reflecting a substantivised ''*méi̯-no-'', meaning 'something given in exchange, gift' from the same root ''*mei̯ '' as in {{sc2|MITAT}}.  This form would be a -''no'' substantive, a widely attested formation and may be presupposed by Latin ''mūnus, mūneris'' 'duty, service, office, offering', from immediate antecedent ''*mói̯-n-es-''. The appearance of ''mitat'' and ''[m]einom'' show a semantic contiguity and may constitute a [[figura etymologica]]. This alliterative form would be analogous to the Old Latin phrase ''donum do'', ''donum'' being formed exactly in the same way as supposed for ''[m]einom'' (''*déh3-no-''). ''*Meinom mito'' would have existed beside ''donum do'', both referring to similar but culturally distinct behaviours, the first one perhaps "specifically involving exchange/reciprocity".{{cite quote|date=November 2017|reason=It's unclear which source this phrase is supposed to ahve come from.}}

The document raises also the question of the kind of the marriage in question, and specifically of whether it was with or without ''[[Manus marriage|manus]]''. Dumézil supported the thesis of a marriage without loss the independent status of the woman (''sine capitis deminutio''). In the last case it should be admitted that in archaic times a form of marriage existed in which the ''sponsio'' was directly linked to the ''nuptiae'', independently from the initial constitution of the ''manus''. The  ''sponsalia'' would then be the occasion upon which the legal subjects defined the compacts concerning  the juridical and economic aspects of the marriage:&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''Lingua Latina'', VI 70-71; Aulus Gellius, ''Noctes Atticae'', IV 4, 1; Ulpian apud ''Digesta'', XXIII 1, 2: "''Sponsalia dicta sunt a spondendo: nam moris fuit veteribus stipulari et spondere sibi uxores futuras''".&lt;/ref&gt; the dowry, the future legal status of the woman who could be put under the ''potestas/tutela'' of one or more persons,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Plautus ''Curc.'' 672.&lt;/ref&gt; the compensations for  a passage of status of the woman and the guarantees for breach of promise. Two strata were perhaps present as testified by the expression ''more atque iure'' of Gellius.

Then the object in question could well have been deposited in a temple upon the occasion of a marriage ritual as a probatory document of an engagement undertaken not by the girl but by her ''sponsor''. The compact would be also a legal guarantee of the rights of the future bridegroom.

===The second section===

The most relevant issue for the interpretation of the document in Sacchi's view is the meaning the lexical couple {{sc2|DUENOS/DUENOI}}. The meaning of ''Duenos'' has been often considered to be the name of the craftsman who made the object. Such an interpretation  meets with the difficulty of how to explain the second occurrence of the word and with the problem of how to interpret {{sc2|MANOM}}, since if ''Duenos'' is a name identifying a person and qualifying  him as 'good' then it would difficult to understand the use of ''manom'' in the same sense of 'good'. It should be easier to understand ''manom'' as ''manum'' ('hand'), i.e. reading: "Duenos made me with his own hands".

Sacchi, following Palmer and Colonna,&lt;ref&gt;R. E. A. Palmer above; G. Colonna above.&lt;/ref&gt; proposes to interpret the couple as conveying a specifically technical religious and legal meaning as is testified in ancient sources. ''Duenos'' has given classic Latin ''bonus'', 'good',&lt;ref&gt;Paulus ex Festo s. v. Matrem Matutam, p. 109 L; Varro, LL VI 4; Varro, VII 26 "''Ian cusianes duonus ceruses duonus Ianusve''": Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' I 3, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; but originally the adjective had certainly religious and sacral implications: in the oldest sacral formulae it had a more technical acception and the repetition had other implications than just [[eurythmy]]. Colonna refers to the formula ''optumus duonorum'' of the mid republic which was a qualificative formula with sacral implication reserved to the upper classes. Correspondences are the opposition of the epithets ''Optimus'' and ''Maximus'' of Capitoline Jupiter, the early Faliscan ''Titia'' inscription "''Eco quton euotenosio titias duenom duenas. Salu[...]voltene''"&lt;ref&gt;To be read as: "''Eco quto*e votenosio titias duenom duenas salve[...]d voltene''" according  to Bakkum, ''The Latin Dialect of the Ager Faliscus: 150 Years of Scholarsahip'', Amsterdam, 2009, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; interpreted as 'good among  the good', the epitaph of [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio (consul 259 BC)|Lucius Cornelius Scipio]], the  consul of 259 BC, ''duonoro[m] optumo[m]... viro[m]'' in which clearly the adjective ''duonus'' is not the synonym of ''optumus'', that as derived from ''ops'', plenty, has different semantic connotations. Colonna also reminds that "in the [[carmen Saliare]] (similarly to the Duenos vase) ''bonus'' (''duonus'') and ''manus'' occur together, both referred to the same character, the god ''Cerus'', fact that makes their synonymity implausible".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Festus s.v. ''Matrem Matutam'': "''... et in carmine Saliari Cerus manus intelligitur creator bonus''" p. 109 L; also  s. v. mane  p. 112 L; Varro ''Lingua Latina'' VII 26: "''ian cusianes duonus ceruses du(o)nus ianusve''"; Colonna, above, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to further clarify the use of the adjective in  the text, Sacchi makes reference also to a well-known passage of Cicero's ''De Legibus'' II 9, 22: ''Deorum Manium iura sancta sunto. (B)onos leto datos divos habento ...''. Here too as in the above two instances "one can remark the opposition between ''Manium'', that, as shown in Paulus exc. Festi, originally meant 'the good ones' and the qualificative (B)onos = Duenos as referred to the deified dead (= ''divos''). Cicero here relates a pontifical prescription of high antiquity consciously preserving  the original wise of expression and lexic".&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''De Legibus'' II 7, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, one could argue that it is not meant that the ''dii [[Manes]]'' become 'good' in the ethic sense, but rather that the dead consecrated to death according to the pontifical prescriptions (''leto datos'') do become gods (= ''divos'').&lt;ref&gt;O. Sacchi, above, p. 333; also citing Georges Dumézil, ''Idées romaines'', pp. 24-25: ''dueno-'' from ''dúvas'' 'cult, offering to a god', "later ''bonus'' used alone shall take up all other values"; A. Ernout and A. Meillet, ''Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue latine'', Paris, 1967, p. 73: "''*dwenos'' from root ''*du-'', technical religious term, Sanskrit ''dúvah'' = 'hommage' ... in Latin religious language ''di boni''"&lt;/ref&gt; The epithet ''duenos''  would then design that which has been given in homage, consecrated correctly according to the pontifical ritual.

Sacchi opines that in the case of the Duenos inscription the speaker is acting according to the religious legal ritual, presumably enacting a private ''consecratio'': the formula of the dedication is then a case of private ''dedicatio dis'', dedication to the gods. The epithet ''duenos'' should therefore be interpreted as used in its original technical sense. The restitution of the text should thus be: "A party acting in the way sanctioned by religious law made/consecrated me for a good end. That no harm/fraud be done to me and to one who is a party (equally) religiously sanctioned by the gods".&lt;ref&gt;A better rendering might be: "... that no harm/fraud be done through me to one who is a party sanctioned by the gods".&lt;/ref&gt; The vase is a speaking token that after the celebration of the ritual consecrates the content of the action, of which it is "the form in its probatory function and the matter as a constituent element".&lt;ref&gt;Taking into account Brent Vine's hypothesis about the interpretation of ''[m]einom'' as ''munus'' though the rendering of the text should be somewhat altered and interpreted as: "A '{{sc2|DUENOS}}' (as above) made me as a good (legal etc.) gift/offering/token, that no evil/harm be done through me to a '{{sc2|DUENOS}}'" or "that no evil party lay me to a '{{sc2|DUENOS}}'".&lt;/ref&gt;

Vine quotes German authors who still follow the erotic thread of interpretation. They think of the vase as a container for beauty products and interpret the last phrase {{sc2|NEMEDMALOSTATOD}} as 'let no evil person steal me'. "{{sc2|STATOD}} would be a form of a Latin verb ''*stare'' that failed to survive for its ''homonymie fâcheuse'' [unfortunate [[homonym]]y&lt;nowiki /&gt;] with the ordinary verb for 'stand{{'"}}, as found in Hittite ''tāyezzi'' 'steals', Vedic ''stená-stāyú'' 'thief'.&lt;ref&gt;H. Rix, "Das letzte Wort der Duenos-Inschrif", MSS, '''46''', 1985, pp. 193 ff.; H. Eichner, "Reklameniamben aus Roms Königszeit", ''Die Sprache'', '''34''', 1988-90, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Sacchi and Vine remark the striking parallelism between the formula of the Duenos inscription: {{sc2|QOIMED MITAT}} and the inscription on a pedestal (probably of a votive statue) from [[Tibur]]: {{sc2|HOI()MED()MITAT...D[O]NOM()PRO()FILEOD}}.&lt;ref&gt;R. Wachter, ''Altlateinische Inschriften'', Bern / Frankfurt am Mein / New York / Paris, 1987; M. Cristofani (ed.), ''La Grande Roma dei Tarquini (Catalogue of the Exhibition, Roma, 12 June to 30 September 1990)'', Rome: L'Erma di Bretscheider, 1990, {{ISBN|88-7062-684-9}}, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Vine finds in it support for his interpreting of {{sc2|[M]EINOM}} as meaning  ''munus''.

===Cosmis===
Sacchi rejects the interpretation of ''cosmis'' as ''agreeable'' in the first section that is traditionally accepted in the  scholarly literature, on the grounds of considerations of history of the language and semantics. He proposes to interpret the term as referring to the peculiar style of hairdressing of brides, known as  ''seni crines'' which would find support in Festus:&lt;ref&gt;Festus s.v. ''Comptus'', p. 55 L.&lt;/ref&gt; "''Comptus id est ornatus ... qui apud nos comis: et comae dicuntur capilli cum aliqua cura compositi''", '&lt;nowiki /&gt;''Comptus'', that is adorned, ... what we call ''comis''; and ''comae'' is named the hair dressed with a certain care'. In the inscription the use of this word would be an explicit allusion to the fact that the girl shall be ready to marry. Festus gives it as a most ancient custom for marriage ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Festus s. v. Senis crinibus, p. 454 L: "''Senis crinibus nubentes ornantur, quod [h]is ornatus vestustissimus fuit''".&lt;/ref&gt; An analogous usage of the word ''comis'' is to be found in Gellius while relating the custom of ''flaminica dialis'' on the occasion of the [[Argei]].&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, ''Noct. Att.'', X 15, 30: "''... cum it ad Argeos, quod neque comit caput neque capillum depictit''".&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Project Greenlight'' controversy ==
In the fourth season premiere of [[Project Greenlight]], Effie Brown, along with director [[Peter Farrelly]] and actors [[Matt Damon]] and [[Ben Affleck]], met to decide which filmmakers would be chosen to direct a feature film for the show. Among the finalists considered were a directing team of an Asian American man, Leo Angelos, and a white woman, Kristen Brancaccio. Effie Brown expressed her support of this team, stating that &lt;nowiki&gt;"I would just urge people to think about whoever this director is, the way that they’re going to treat the character of Harmony, her being a prostitute,” Brown counters. “[She’s] the only black person, being a hooker who gets hit by her white pimp."&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2015/09/14/project_greenlight_s_new_star_is_effie_brown_the_premiere_revealed_exactly.html|title=Project Greenlight Revealed Exactly Why Hollywood Still Has a Diversity Problem|last=Harris|first=Aisha|date=2015-09-14|work=Slate|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damon, feeling frustration that the show had not properly cast more diverse filmmakers for the competition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/movies/matt-damon-you-could-call-him-down-to-earth.html|title=Matt Damon: You Could Call Him Down to Earth|last=Ito|first=Robert|date=2015-12-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;, responded that "when you’re talking about diversity, you do it in the casting of the film, not the casting of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/16/matt-damon-screen-diversity_n_8145692.html|title=Matt Damon In Hot Water Over Diversity Remarks|date=2015-09-16|work=HuffPost UK|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Critics of Damon's comments stated that he was "mansplaining" and "whitesplaining" diversity to Effie Brown&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-34278195|title=Matt Damon 'sorry' over diversity row|date=2015-09-17|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accused him of being racially tone deaf.

The '''''Exploding Plastic Inevitable''''', sometimes simply called '''''Plastic Inevitable''''' or '''''EPI''''', was a series of [[multimedia]] events organized by [[Andy Warhol]] between 1966 and 1967, featuring musical performances by [[The Velvet Underground]] and [[Nico]], screenings of Warhol's films, and dancing and performances by regulars of Warhol's [[The Factory|Factory]], especially [[Mary Woronov]] and [[Gerard Malanga]]. ''Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable'' is also the title of an 18-minute film by Ronald Nameth with recordings from one week of performances of the shows which were filmed in [[Chicago, Illinois]], in 1966. In December 1966 Warhol included a one-off magazine called ''The Plastic Exploding Inevitable'' as part of the ''[[Aspen (magazine)|Aspen]]'' No. 3 package.&lt;ref name=Aspen&gt;{{Cite journal|title=From the research laboratories of Andy Warhol comes this issue of Aspen Magazine |date=April 1967 |url=http://www.ubu.com/aspen/advertisements/aspen3Ad.html |journal=[[Evergreen Review]] |volume=11 |issue=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable with Nico.png|thumb|left|170px|Performance of Exploding Plastic Inevitable in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]]]
The ''Exploding Plastic Inevitable'' had its beginnings in an event staged on January 13, 1966, at a dinner for the New York Society for Clinical Psychiatry. This event, called "Up-Tight", included performances by the Velvet Underground and Nico, along with Malanga and [[Edie Sedgwick]] as dancers&lt;ref name=BWJ&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Branden W. |last=Joseph |authorlink=Branden W.

==Legacy==

[[Andy Warhol]]'s lights engineer Danny Williams pioneered many innovations that have since become standard practice in rock music light shows. From May 27–29 the '''''EPI''''' played [[The Fillmore]] in San Francisco, where Williams built a light show including [[stroboscope|stroboscopes]], slides and film projections onstage. At [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]'s request he was soon to come back and build more. Film maker [[Jonas Mekas]] (who pioneered film projections during concerts at New York's Cinematheque), Andy Warhol and Danny Williams' influential ideas contributed much to the legendary Fillmore Auditorium's prestige and were also used at the [[Fillmore East]] and [[Fillmore West]], both opening in 1968.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17290">[[File:Anatomy of a Male Nude.jpg|thumb|right|Figure drawing by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]
A '''figure drawing''' is a drawing of the human form in any of its various shapes and [[Human positions|postures]] using any of the drawing [[Drawing#Media|media]]. The term can also refer to the act of producing such a [[drawing]]. The degree of representation may range from highly detailed, anatomically correct renderings to loose and expressive sketches. A "life drawing" is a drawing of the human figure from observation of a live [[Model (art)|model]]. A figure drawing may be a composed work of art or a [[figure study]] done in preparation for a more finished work such as a painting.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Ch. 8 – "Drawing as Preparation"&lt;/ref&gt; Figure drawing is arguably the most difficult subject an [[artist]] commonly encounters, and entire courses are dedicated to the subject. The human figure is one of the most enduring themes in the visual arts, and the human figure can be the basis of [[portrait painting|portraiture]], illustration, [[sculpture]], [[medical illustration]], and other fields.

==Approaches==
Artists take a variety of approaches to drawing the human figure. They may draw from live models or from photographs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= Maureen Johnson &amp; Douglas Johnson 
  | title = Art Models: Life Nudes for Drawing, Painting, and Sculpting
  | isbn=978-0976457329|year=2006|publisher=Live Model Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; from skeletal models, or from memory and imagination. Most instruction focuses on the use of models in "life drawing" courses. The use of photographic reference—although common since the development of [[photography]]—is often criticized or discouraged for its tendency to produce "flat" images that fail to capture the dynamic aspects of the subject. Drawing from imagination is often lauded for the expressiveness it encourages, and criticized for the inaccuracies introduced by the artist's lack of knowledge or limited memory in visualizing the human figure; the experience of the artist with other methods has a large influence on the effectiveness of this approach.

In developing the image, some artists focus on the shapes created by the interplay of light and dark values on the surfaces of the body.  Others take an anatomical approach, beginning by approximating the internal [[skeleton]] of the figure, overlaying the internal organs and [[muscle|musculature]], and covering those shapes with the skin, and finally (if applicable) clothing; study of human internal anatomy is usually involved in this technique.  Another approach is to loosely construct the body out of [[geometry|geometric]] shapes, e.g., a sphere for the cranium, a cylinder for the torso, etc. then refine those shapes to more closely resemble the human form.

For those working without visual reference (or as a means of checking one's work), proportions commonly recommended in figure drawing are:
* An average person is generally 7-and-a-half heads tall (including the head). This can be illustrated to students in the classroom using paper plates to visually demonstrate the length of their bodies.
* An ideal figure, used for an impression of nobility or grace, is drawn at 8 heads tall.
* A heroic figure used in the depiction of gods and superheroes is eight-and-a-half heads tall.  Most of the additional length comes from a bigger chest and longer legs.
Note that these proportions are most useful for a standing model.  Poses which introduce [[foreshortening]] of various body parts will cause them to differ.

The [[Paris Salon|French Salon]] in the 19th century recommended the use of [[Conté]] crayons, which are sticks of wax, oil and pigment, combined with specially formulated paper. Erasure was not permitted; instead, the artist was expected to describe the figure in light strokes before making darker, more visible marks.

[[File:Corinth stehender Mädchenakt.jpg|thumb|Figure drawing by [[Lovis Corinth]]. Before 1925]]

A popular modern technique is the use of a [[charcoal]] stick, prepared from special vines, and a rougher form of paper. The charcoal adheres loosely to the paper, allowing very easy erasure, but the final drawing can be preserved using a spray-on "fixative" to keep the charcoal from rubbing off.  Harder compressed charcoal can produce a more deliberate and precise effect, and graduated tones can be produced by smudging with the fingers or with a cylindrical paper tool called a [[stump (drawing)|stump]].

Graphite pencil is also commonly used for figure drawing. For this purpose artists' pencils are sold in various formulations, ranging from 9B (very soft) to 1B (medium soft), and from 1H (medium hard) to 9H (very hard). Like charcoal, it can be erased and manipulated using a stump.

Ink is another popular medium. The artist will often start with graphite pencil to sketch or outline the drawing, then the final line work is done with a pen or brush, with permanent ink. The ink may be diluted with water to produce gradations, a technique called ink wash. The pencil marks may be erased after the ink is applied, or left in place with the dark inks overpowering them.

Some artists draw directly in ink without the preparation of a pencil sketch, preferring the spontaneity of this approach despite the fact that it limits the ability to correct mistakes. [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]] is an artist known to have worked in this way.

A favored method of [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]] and other 17th and 18th-century artists of the [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] era was to start with a colored ground of tone halfway between white and black, and to add shade in black and highlights in white, using pen and ink or "crayon".

==History==
The human figure has been the subject of drawings since prehistoric times. While the studio practices of the artists of antiquity are largely a matter of conjecture, that they often drew and modeled from nude models is suggested by the anatomical sophistication of their works. An anecdote related by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] describes how [[Zeuxis]] reviewed the young women of [[Agrigentum]] naked before selecting five whose features he would combine in order to paint an ideal image.&lt;ref name="Strict6"&gt;''Strictly Academic'' 1974 p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of nude models in the medieval artist's workshop is implied in the writings of [[Cennino Cennini]], and a manuscript of [[Villard de Honnecourt]] confirms that sketching from life was an established practice in the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Strict6" /&gt; [[The Carracci]], who opened their ''[[Accademia degli Incamminati]]'' in Bologna in the 1580s, set the pattern for later art schools by making life drawing the central discipline.&lt;ref&gt;''Strictly Academic'' 1974, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The course of training began with the copying of engravings, then proceeded to drawing from plaster casts, after which the students were trained in drawing from the live model.

In the late 18th century, students in [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s studio followed a rigorous program of instruction.  Mastery in drawing was considered a prerequisite to painting. For about six hours each day, students drew from a model who remained in the same pose for one week.&lt;ref&gt;''Strictly Academic'' 1974, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the late 19th century, women were generally not admitted to figure drawing classes.&lt;ref&gt;''Strictly Academic'' 1974, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academy figure==
[[Image:Subleyras charon passant les ombres louvre.jpg|thumb|A transcended academy figure by neoclassical painter [[Pierre Subleyras]] ]]
An '''''[[academy figure]]''''' is a [[drawing]], [[painting]] or [[sculpture]] in a literal manner, of the [[Nude (art)|nude human body]] using a live model, typically at half life size.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} &lt;!--in sculpture it's one-third life size --&gt;

It is a common exercise required of students at [[art school]]s and [[Academy#Academies of the arts|academies]], both in the past and present, hence the name.&lt;ref&gt;Claude-Henri Watelet, « Académie » and « Modèle », dans Encyclopédie méthodique. Beaux-arts, Paris, Panckoucke, 1791. Source cited in [[:fr:Académie (dessin)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===

Historical accounts reveal that nude models for aspiring [[Women artists|female artists]] were largely unavailable. Women were barred from certain institutions because it was considered improper and possibly even dangerous for them to study from nude models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Myers|first=Nicole|title=Women Artists in Nineteenth–Century France|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/19wa/hd_19wa.htm|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though men were given access to both male and female nudes, women were confined to learning anatomy from casts and models. It was not until 1893 that female students were allowed access to life drawing at the Royal Academy in London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levin|first=Kim|title=Top Ten ARTnews Stories: Exposing the Hidden ‘He’|url=http://www.artnews.com/2007/11/01/top-ten-artnews-stories-exposing-the-hidden-he/|publisher=ArtNews}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even then the model was required to be partially draped.&lt;ref name="Nochlin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nochlin|first=Linda|title=Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?|url=http://art-history.concordia.ca/news-and-events/Nochlin.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The limited access to nude figures impeded the careers and development of female artists. The most prestigious forms of painting required in-depth knowledge of anatomy that was systematically denied to women,&lt;ref name="Nochlin"/&gt; who were thereby relegated to less-regarded forms of painting such as [[genre art|genre]], [[still life]], [[landscape]] and [[portrait painting|portraiture]]. In [[Linda Nochlin]]’s essay "Why have There Been No Great Women Artists" she identifies the restricted access that women had to nude figure drawing as a historically significant barrier to women's artistic development.&lt;ref name="Nochlin"/&gt;

==Contemporary studio instruction==
[[Image:Carracci, Annibale - Studio di nudo.jpg|thumb|left|240px|alt=Drawing of a man sitting with crossed legs|Nude study by [[Annibale Carracci]]]]

Figure drawing instruction is an element of most [[fine art]] and [[illustration]] programs. [[List of academies of fine art in Italy|Academies of fine art in Italy]] have a '''scuola libera del nudo''' ("free school of the nude") which forms part of the degree program but is also open to outside students.&lt;ref&gt;Maggioli (2013).[https://books.google.com/books?id=nMTBAxeMJrMC&amp;pg=PA830 ''Codice delle leggi della scuola''], pp. 829–830. {{ISBN|8838778639}} {{it}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical figure drawing studio classroom, the students sit around a model either in a semicircle or a full circle. No two students have exactly the same view, thus their drawing will reflect the perspective of the artist's unique location relative to the model. The model often poses on a stand, to enable students to more easily find an unobstructed view. Depending on the type of pose, furniture and/or props may be used. These are typically included in the drawing, to the extent that they are visible to the artist. However, backgrounds are commonly ignored unless the objective is to learn about placement of figures in an environment.  Individual models are most common, but multiple models may be used in more advanced classes.  Many studios are equipped to allow a variety of lighting arrangements.

When taught at the college level, figure drawing models are often (but not always) [[nude]] (aside from small jewelry or other inconspicuous items). While posing, the model is usually requested to remain perfectly still. Because of the difficulty of doing this for an extended period of time, periodic breaks for the model to rest and/or stretch are usually included in longer sessions and for more difficult poses. 

At the beginning of a figure drawing session, the model is often requested to make a series of brief poses in rapid succession. These are called gesture poses, and are typically one to three minutes each. [[Gesture drawing]] is a warm-up exercise for many artists, although some artists sketch out the gesture as the first step in every figure drawing.&lt;ref&gt;The Art Model's Handbook http://www.artmodelbook.com&lt;/ref&gt; These broad strokes are not just done by the flick of a wrist, but by using the whole arm to capture the motion of the model. It also helps to keep the artist focused on the model instead of the paper. When it comes to the human body, artists are painfully critical; the proportions of a still life do not have to be drawn perfectly to look authentic, but even the slightest error in human proportions will be easily detected.

Modern and contemporary artists may choose to exaggerate or distort proportions to emphasise the gesture or perceived mood of the models' pose. The outcomes can be regarded as a finished artwork, expressing both the subject, the observational, emotional and mark making response to the artists figure drawing experience.

Anatomy is only the first level of concern in life classes. [[Figure–ground (perception)|Figure-ground]] relationships and other aspects of composition are also considered. Balance of a composition becomes more crucial and therefore more understood through life drawing. The artist's [[kinesthetic]] response to the pose and how this is conveyed through a choice of art media is a more advanced concern.
Since the purpose of figure drawing classes is to learn how to draw humans of all kinds, male and female models of all ages, shapes, and ethnicities are usually sought, rather than selecting only beautiful models or those with [[Body proportions|"ideal" figures]].  Some instructors specifically seek to avoid the sort of models preferred by fashion photographers, seeking more "realistic" examples and to avoid any implication of sexual objectification. Instructors may also favor models of particular body types based on the unique contours or surface textures they provide. The variety of models hired may be limited by the need for them to hold a pose for extended periods (eliminating restless children and frail older persons), and concerns of modesty and legality when models pose nude (restricting the use of minors).

'''''Head in Flames''''' is a [[postmodern novel]] by [[Lance Olsen]], published by Chiasmus Press in 2009.

==Plot &amp; Structure==
''Head in Flames'' is a collage novel built on a triadic structure. First [[Vincent van Gogh]] speaks briefly (sometimes only a sentence, sometimes a handful) in the first person in a [[Times New Roman|Times font]]. Next [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] does the same in the third person in Times bold. Last [[Mohammed Bouyeri]] speaks in the second person in a [[Courier (typeface)|Courier font]]. This pattern repeats for the length of the text. The effect is more musical than narrative in a conventional sense.

Van Gogh finds himself standing in a field in [[Auvers-sur-Oise]] in July 1890, debating whether or not to commit suicide. Theo finds himself riding to work on the day he was assassinated in [[Amsterdam]] in November 2004 by Mohammed, an extremist outraged by the filmmaker's collaboration with controversial politician [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]] on a 10-minute experimental short critiquing Muslim subjugation and abuse of women.

The consequence of such a structure is a complex investigation into art's multiplicity of purpose, religion's increasingly dominant role as engine of politics and extremism in the contemporary world, the complexities involved in foreignness/assimilation, and the limits of cultural tolerance.

==Reception==
''[[Rain Taxi]]'' wrote that ''Head in Flames'' is "distinguished both by its inventive, playful form and its evocative content,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=O Muse of Fire…|url=http://www.raintaxi.com/online/2010summer/olsen.shtml|accessdate=8 December 2012|journal=Rain Taxi|date=Summer 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Review of Contemporary Fiction'' called Olsen's novel "an important book" whose "structure is a tour de force of formal innovation calling to mind [[Robert Pinget|Pinget]]'s ''That Voice,'' [[Juan Rulfo|Rulfo]]’s [[Pedro Páramo]], and [[Julio Cortazar|Cortázar]]’s ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cortazar novel)|Hopscotch]]''…. Olsen’s real success lies not in his critique of the many forms of intolerance but rather in his affirmation of art as salvation.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Head in Flames|url=http://www.dalkeyarchive.com/book/?fa=customcontent&amp;GCOI=15647100710110&amp;extrasfile=7DBDDA4C-1D09-67E0-43C6D06F82918E8F.html|accessdate=8 December 2012|journal=Review of Contemporary Fiction|date=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lontar Foundation''', a [[not-for-profit organization]] based in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]], was founded in 1987 by four Indonesian writers: [[Goenawan Mohamad]], [[Sapardi Djoko Damono]], [[Umar Kayam]], and [[Subagio Sastrowardoyo]] and the American translator, [[John H. McGlynn]].&lt;ref name="Tempo1"&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |author=Poernomo Gontha Ridho |authorlink= |date=10 December 2003 |title=Duta Besar AS Sumbang Yayasan Lontar |trans-title=U.S. Embassador donates to the Lontar Foundation |journal=Tempo |volume= |series= |issue= |page= |pages= |at= |chapter= |location= |publisher= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |language=Indonesian |id= |isbn= |issn=0126-4273 |oclc= |pmid= |pmc= |bibcode= |doi= |accessdate= |url=http://www.tempointeractive.com/hg/nasional/2003/12/10/brk,20031210-37,id.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040401123030/http://www.tempointeractive.com/hg/nasional/2003/12/10/brk,20031210-37,id.html|archivedate=2004-04-01|laysource= |laysummary= |laydate= |quote= |ref=|dead-url=yes|postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation is an independent organization, neither affiliated with nor intended to promote the interests of any particular political cause or group. The Foundation's core activity is the translation and publication of Indonesian literary works whose long-term goals are:

* To stimulate the further development of Indonesian literature;
* To make Indonesian literature accessible to an international audience; and
* To preserve for future generations Indonesia's literary record.

One of Lontar's most noted works is ''Illuminations : the writing traditions of Indonesia : featuring manuscripts from the National Library of Indonesia''. According to Associate Professor Jean Gelman Taylor from the University of New South Wales, "Wetherhill and the Lontar Foundation have made a major contribution to scholarship by bringing together in one book these samples of Indonesia's intellectual and artistic heritage." &lt;ref name="AsianStudies"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Taylor | first =  Jean Gelman | authorlink =

 | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | pages = 916–919 | jstor = 2658818 | mr = | zbl = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lontar also published ''Indonesia in the Soeharto Years - Issues, Incidents and images'' written by [[John H. McGlynn]] and a large number of other writers. According to Dr. Katharine McGregor, Senior Lecturer in Southeast Asian History at the University of Melbourne, "[a] strength of the work is the rich collection of photographs which document key protests, acts of violence, street life and Indonesian protest art." &lt;ref name="InsideIndonesia1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McGregor |first=Katharine |author= |authorlink= |date=13 April 2008 |title=Book Reviews-Indonesia in the Soeharto years: Issues Incidents and Images|trans-title= |journal=Inside Indonesia |volume= |series= |issue= |page= |pages= |at= |chapter= |location= |publisher= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |language= |format= |id= |isbn= |issn=0814-1185 |oclc= |pmid= |pmc= |bibcode= |doi= |accessdate=30 October 2012|url=http://www.insideindonesia.org/weekly-articles/book-reviews |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415020152/http://www.insideindonesia.org/weekly-articles/book-reviews|archivedate=2013-04-15|laysource= |laysummary= |laydate= |quote= |ref=|dead-url=yes |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Lontar Foundation published the ''Lontar Anthology of Indonesian Drama'', the first anthology of Indonesian drama translated into English, featuring a diverse group of translators such as [[Harry Aveling]], an authority on Indonesian and Malay literature, among others. In May 2011, the Lontar Foundation launched a new series of Indonesian literature translated into English called the ''Modern Library of Indonesia'' featuring works from the 1920s until the present, including authors such as [[Putu Wijaya]] and [[Dewi Lestari]].&lt;ref name="JakartaGlobe1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Found in Translation: Putting Indonesian Novels on the Map |author=Katrin Figge |author2= |author3= |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/arts/found-in-translation-putting-indonesian-novels-on-the-map/442007 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130204011146/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/arts/found-in-translation-putting-indonesian-novels-on-the-map/442007 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 February 2013 |newspaper=The Jakara Globe |publisher= |location=Jakarta, Indonesia |issn= |date=20 May 2011 |page= |pages= |accessdate=30 October 2012 |trans-title= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Tempo (Indonesian magazine)|''Tempo'']], "[Lontar] has inarguably become Indonesia's foremost literary foundation, and now has under its belt an impressive collection of translated literary works, from prose to poetry to drama." &lt;ref name="Tempo3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kusumaatmadja |first=Kendisan |author= |authorlink= |date=23–29 January 2012  |title=A Portrait of Our Times|trans-title= |journal=Tempo |volume= |series= |issue= |page= |pages=40–41 |at= |chapter= |location= |publisher= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |language= |format= |id= |isbn= |issn=0126-4273 |oclc= |pmid= |pmc= |bibcode= |doi= |accessdate=2 February 2012|url=http://eng.tempointeraktif.com/arsip/2012/01/25/BK/mbm.20120125.BK24131.id.php |laysource= |laysummary= |laydate= |quote= |ref=|postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lorraine Broderick''' (born 1948) is an [[Americans|American]] television soap opera writer.  She got her start on ''[[All My Children]]'' as a protégée of the show's creator, [[Agnes Nixon]]. She went on to serve four different stints as its [[Head Writer]], ultimately earning her four [[Daytime Emmy]] awards in that capacity. Broderick's work on the show has often been met with critical acclaim, citing her as its finest head writer outside of Nixon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=December 13, 2011|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|publisher=[[Source Interlink]]|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the last head writer of ''All My Children's''  40-year broadcast run on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], penning the show through its network finale on September 23, 2011.

==Bio==
Lorraine Broderick graduated from [[Andover High School (Massachusetts)|Andover High School]] in 1966 and [[Mt. Holyoke College]] in 1970. She joined ''All My Children'' as scriptwriter and breakdown writer in 1979, under the guidance of then-head writer [[Agnes Nixon]]. In 1982, Broderick would promote to an Associate Head Writer alongside fellow Nixon protégée [[Wisner Washam]], who himself would be promoted to Head Writer the following year. In 1986, Broderick was appointed Co-Head Writer, sharing duties with Washam, who would exit the show himself in 1987 – leaving Broderick as the sole head writer. Broderick won her first Outstanding Writing Team Daytime Emmy award as head writer alongside Washam in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6Q4mAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vPwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5526,9424331&amp;dq=lorraine-broderick&amp;hl=en|title=Donoughe, Winfrey win Emmys for talk shows|date=June 30, 1988|work=[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Telegraph]]|agency=AP  |page=47|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a network mandate for creative changes had Broderick demoted back to Associate Head Writer, when [[Margaret DePriest]] was appointed head writer of ''All My Children'' in early 1989. But DePriest would not last long in the position, as Agnes Nixon would resume head writing duties by the end of that year – once again with Broderick and a returned Wisner Washam as her Associate Head Writers.

After 12 years with All My Children's writing team, Broderick left in 1991 to become the co-head writer of ''[[Guiding Light]]''. While Broderick wrote for ''Guiding Light'', the show received much critical acclaim, and the early 1990s are widely considered to have been a golden era for the show.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In the spring of 1995, when [[Megan McTavish]] was fired from her writing post at ''All My Children'', Broderick left her post as Associate Head Writer of ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'' to once again become AMC's head writer. Broderick would win three consecutive Daytime Emmy awards for Outstanding Writing Team from her work as head writer of the show, bringing her total to four Emmy honors as a daytime head writer. She left ''All My Children'' for the second time in December 1997 when [[ABC Daytime]] decided to bring back McTavish.

In early 1998, Broderick was hired at [[CBS Daytime]]'s ''[[As the World Turns]]'' where her most notable story was the resurrection of evil David Stenbeck and the switch of [[Lily Snyder]]'s baby with another baby.

In July 1999, a complete behind-the-scenes overhaul at the show led to Broderick's exit. Shortly after, she was hired by ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' Executive Producer [[Ken Corday]] to helm his show's writing team. However, she was there for less than a month before she left over disagreements with Co-Executive Producer [[Tom Langan]] (who would assume the writing duties himself).  Reportedly, Langan wanted to rapidly age the next generation of teens and immediately place them in front-burner storylines, while Broderick wanted to phase them in gradually; Broderick's character-driven storytelling style was also reportedly not favored by Langan, who preferred more outlandish plotting.

Broderick then joined ''[[Port Charles]]'' as an Associate Head Writer, before being appointed head writer of ''[[One Life to Live]]'' in January 2001. In 2003, she was demoted to associate head writer upon the return of famed ''One Life to Live'' writing team [[Michael Malone]] and [[Josh Griffith]].  At that time, ABC Daytime President [[Brian Frons]] offered Broderick a return to the head writing duties at ''All My Children'', but she declined. Broderick left ''One Life to Live'' altogether in 2004, returning to ''Guiding Light'' for a short stint as Associate Head Writer, during the show's transition to a new head writing team.

She would eventually accept a position as a screenwriting and playwriting professor at [[Drexel University]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. This move reunited her with her former colleague, [[Felicia Minei Behr]], former executive producer of ''All My Children'' and ''As the World Turns'', who served at Drexel as a professor of film &amp; TV production.

In November 2009, Broderick returned to ''All My Children'' at the request of her one-time mentor, Agnes Nixon – following the dismissal of outgoing head writer [[Charles Pratt Jr.]] – as part of ABC's concerted effort to increased ratings. However, Broderick once again passed on being head writer in a permanent capacity. On January 13, 2010, ABC announced [[David Kreizman]] and [[Donna Swajeski]] as the new head writers. Broderick would continue as the interim head writer until her successors were in place on March 15, 2010. She then assumed her duties as Associate Head Writer.

On April 2, 2011, amid rumors of ''All My Children's'' possible cancellation, [[Soaps in Depth]] broke the news via Twitter that Broderick was once again named the show's head writer, replacing Kreizman and Swajeski. The show's cancellation was announced just two weeks later, with Broderick writing the show through its conclusion on September 23, 2011. She then returned to ''One Life to Live'' as a breakdown writer until that show's finale on January 13, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=soapsindepthabc|author=Soaps In Depth ABC|number=54332677863645184|date=3 April 2011|title=Great news kids: #AMC is NOT being canceled.

In April 2012, it was confirmed that Broderick would join the team of new ''Days of our Lives'' co-head writers [[Gary Tomlin]] and [[Christopher Whitesell]] as a breakdown writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soapoperadigest.com/content/its-official-days-names-new-writing-team |title=It's Official: DAYS Names New Writing Team |work=Soap Opera Digest |accessdate=April 6, 2012 |date=April 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luminous Interactive''' digital art platform was the brainchild of [[Lend Lease Group]] in collaboration with [http://ramus.com.au/portfolios/luminous-darling-quarter/ Ramus Illumination], and is billed, according to the [[Wall Street Journal]], as 'the world's biggest interactive permanent light display'. It was officially opened in the Darling Quarter Precinct in [[Sydney Central Business District]] (CBD) on 18 May 2012. 

Luminous at Darling Quarter is a permanent platform solely for illuminated digital 'art' – both animated and static. The 'canvas' extends over four levels of two campus-style buildings, covering 557 windows in total, and presents a digital façade spanning a distance of 150&amp;nbsp;metres. The artistic and design direction was set by international light artist [https://darlingquarter.com/play/luminous/ Bruce Ramus,] with Ramus studio responsible for design management and production of the work. Fixtures were manufactured by Australian architectural lighting specialists Klik Systems using advanced [[LED]] systems.

==Interactive==
[[File:LuminousDarlingQuarter17.jpg|thumb|upright|Interactive technology by iion, in collaboration with Ramus Illumination, activates the canvas and gives Luminous a social/web presence]]

Interactive content is available from 6pm, Friday through Sunday, with touch screen kiosks in [[Tumbalong Park]] allowing the general public to paint their own digital designs and play over-scaled arcade games on the buildings in front of them. Web surfers can also play using their smart phone or contribute on their computer through a dedicated website. The online component of Luminous has similarities to [[Project Blinkenlights]], a Berlin digital light installation, but expands the concept for the general public, allowing user-friendly interaction in an unprecedented way.

==Luminous concept==

The [[Commonwealth Bank of Australia]] occupying the buildings is joint partner in the project along with the [[Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority]] and [[Lend Lease]]. The consortium selected Bruce Ramus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ramus.com.au/profile/|title=Profile - Ramus|work=Ramus|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the first artist, Artistic Director and Lighting Designer for Luminous. Canadian-born Ramus made his name lighting stage shows for [[U2]] and [[David Bowie]], and is design mentor for [[Sydney Opera House]].

==Technology==

At Darling Quarter, each window forms a 'pixel' in the canvas, lit with Klik Systems's energy efficient LEDs, and seen from a distance can form a coherent animated picture. A sophisticated colour palette is available thanks to white LEDs added to the standard RGB (red, green, blue) colours. The system is also capable of integrating music: graphic synchronization allows for sound-based designs to be visualized on the canvas.

Contrary to many light installations, direct light is minimized to viewers, instead using the automated timber louvers to reflect light from Klik System's linear LEDs (running along the windowsills, angled upwards with a 10-degree spreader lens). The entire project offsets almost all its energy use, thanks to photo-voltaic panels on the roof of both Darling Quarter buildings. The project allegedly uses the same power as 5 household vacuum cleaners.

==Darling Quarter==

Lend Lease designed and constructed Darling Quarter for owner APPF Commercial and first proposed the idea of a permanent space for illuminated art. Darling Quarter precinct includes a community green, children’s playground, and a large number of world-food restaurants, cafes and bars, and reflects Lend Lease’s enthusiasm for iconic new spaces for future generations.

The digital façade is in action six evenings a week. On Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, displaying ‘soft’ images (such as clouds or waves). On Friday, Saturday and Sunday 'Luminous' displays interactive artworks that aim to invite debate and make art critics – and artists - of every citizen and visitor. 

Sydney has a growing reputation for light shows, particularly due to the annual VIVID Sydney festival and the SPARC DESIGN lighting conferences at the Museum of Modern Art, which are regularly sponsored by Klik Systems and other long term supporters in the Australian lighting industry. Vivid Sydney was inaugurated in 2008, curated in 2010 by [[Laurie Anderson]] and [[Lou Reed]] and is billed as an international [[carbon-neutral]] festival of Light, Music and Ideas. The 2012 musical line-up includes [[Sufjan Stevens]] and [[Florence &amp; The Machine]].

'''Marvin Glass and Associates''' (MGA) was a [[toy]] design and engineering firm based in [[Chicago]].  Marvin Glass (1914–1974) and his employees created some of the most successful toys and games of the twentieth century such as [[Mr. Machine]], [[Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots]], [[Lite Brite]], [[Ants in the Pants]], [[Mouse Trap (game)|Mouse Trap]], [[Operation (game)|Operation]], [[Simon (game)|Simon]], Body Language, and the [[Evel Knievel]] Stunt Cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon M. Scott, ''Toys and American Culture: An Encyclopedia'' ([[ABC-CLIO]], 2010), {{ISBN|978-0313351112}}, pp. 131-132.

==History==
Marvin Glass and Associates was founded in 1941. Its founder, Marvin Glass, was an entrepreneur and the creative force behind Marvin Glass and Associates. His salesmanship and uncanny ability to spark creativity in the designers he employed was unparalleled. In 1949, he licensed a "novelty item" to H. Fishlove &amp; Company called Yakitty-Yak Talking Teeth. This item was invented by Eddy Goldfarb, who worked with Marvin Glass for a very short time after World War II.

The first big hit for Marvin Glass was Mr. Machine, a toy invented by a former watchmaker named Leo Kripak.  A child could take [[Mr. Machine]] apart and put him back together. It was licensed to [[Ideal Toys]] and became such a hit that Lionel Weintraub, its president, made it his company mascot and featured it in many of Ideal's early TV ads. The company became so successful that Marvin Glass got his company logo printed on every package for the items it invented and licensed.

The organization's general counsel, James F. Coffee, and accountant Ernest Sonderling, were the architects of the successful business model whereby the designs and inventions were patented and licensed to various toy companies and manufacturers who would pay running royalties based on sales. Outside counsel, chairman and founder of the Intellectual Property Department at McDermott Will &amp; Emery, Robert J. Schneider, was responsible for procuring the patents and protecting them from infringement. Mr. Schneider is currently Co-Chair of the Intellectual Property Department of Taft, Stettinius &amp; Hollister LLP.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140102/NEWS04/131239973/taft-starts-adding-lawyers-following-shefsky-merger#&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph M. Burck was a senior designer at Marvin Glass through the mid-1960s to early 1980s and invented or designed many of MGA's hottest items such as [[Inchworm_(toy)|Inch Worm]], [[Lite-Brite]], Astrolite, [[Which_Witch%3F_(board_game)|Which Witch]], [[Masterpiece_(game)|Masterpiece]], [[SSP Racers]], [[Chu-Bops]], and the [[Evel Knievel]] line of toys (Burck was Knievel's personal guest at the infamous [[Snake River Canyon (Idaho)|Snake River Canyon]] jump.) Burck holds 10 US patents for items developed by MGA. [[Time Magazine]] named Lite-Brite one of the top 100 toys of all time. &lt;ref&gt;http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/completelist/0,29569,2049243,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Marvin Glass died in 1974. Two years later, company CEO Anson Isaacson and two other company employees were shot and killed (and several others were wounded) at the company's offices in Chicago by another designer who then killed himself.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RvwjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jH4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6952,3298190&amp;dq=marvin-glass&amp;hl=en "Chicago Man Kills 3, Shoots Himself"], [[United Press International|UPI]] in ''[[Milwaukee Journal]]'', July 28, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
MGA was contracted by [[Bally-Midway]] to design [[video arcade game|coin-operated video games]] during the 1980s. Some of the games produced by MGA during this era include ''[[Tapper (arcade game)|Tapper]]'', ''[[Domino Man]]'' and ''[[Timber (video game)|Timber]]''.
 
The company continued in operation until 1988. Several partners from Marvin Glass and Associates subsequently started [[Big Monster Toys]], which remains to this day and is still based in Chicago.

'''''Miranda''''' was a British television [[sitcom]] written by and starring comedian [[Miranda Hart]]. It originally aired on [[BBC Two]] from 9 November 2009 and later on [[BBC One]]. 
Developed from Hart's semi-autobiographical [[BBC Radio 2]] comedy ''Miranda Hart's Joke Shop'' (2008), the situation comedy revolves around socially inept Miranda, who frequently finds herself in awkward situations.  The show features actors [[Sarah Hadland]], [[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]], [[Patricia Hodge]], [[Sally Phillips]], [[James Holmes (actor)|James Holmes]] and [[Bo Poraj]]. It was filmed in front of live audiences at the [[BBC Television Centre]] and [[The London Studios]].

Receiving positive comments from critics, ''Miranda'' won a [[Royal Television Society]] award and gained several [[BAFTA TV Award]] nominations.&lt;ref name="Sally"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6794548.ece|title=The best television for autumn 2009|last=Kinnes|first=Sally|work=[[Sunday Times]]|publisher=[[News International]]|date=16 August 2009|accessdate=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times-Maxwell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6898506.ece|title=Miranda Hart stands head and shoulders above the rest|last=Maxwell|first=Dominic|work=[[The Times]]|publisher=[[News International]]|date=2 November 2009|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mean vicky"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2009/nov/24/miranda-funny|title=Miranda: you are awful, but I like you|last=Frost|first=Vicky|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=24 November 2009|accessdate=9 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922201136/http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2009/nov/24/miranda-funny|archivedate=22 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series has since been regularly repeated on British television and is available in the United States through [[Hulu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hulu.com/miranda|title=Hulu: Watch Miranda online|publisher=[[Hulu]]|accessdate=27 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630032639/http://www.hulu.com/miranda|archivedate=30 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Premise ==
{{main|List of Miranda episodes}}

The episodes revolve around the difficulties Miranda ([[Miranda Hart]]) gets herself into. She is {{convert|6|ft|1|in|cm|abbr=on}} tall and, sometimes mistaken for a man, is addressed as 'Sir'. She has never fit in with her old boarding school friends, Tilly ([[Sally Phillips]]) and Fanny ([[Katy Wix]]), and finds social situations awkward, especially around men. She is a constant disappointment to her mother, Penny ([[Patricia Hodge]]), who is desperate for her to get a proper job and a husband. Although Miranda owns and lives above her own [[wikt:joke shop|joke shop]] and [[boutique]], she lacks any real capacity for business, so it is managed by her childhood friend Stevie Sutton ([[Sarah Hadland]]). The restaurant next door is initially run by Clive Evans ([[James Holmes (actor)|James Holmes]]), until series three, when the restaurant's chef, Gary Preston ([[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]]), purchases it from him. After many failed attempts at dating, Miranda and Gary, a friend from university whom Miranda fancies, decide to be just friends. Nevertheless, when Gary gets a girlfriend called Rose ([[Naomi Bentley]]), it prompts Miranda to start a new relationship with Michael Jackford ([[Bo Poraj]]), a local reporter whose work soon takes him to Africa. Upon his return he proposes to Miranda, as does Gary when he realises his love for her. Miranda accepts Gary's proposal rather than Michael's and Miranda and Gary get married in the final episode.

* [[Miranda Hart]] as Miranda – An ungainly, socially awkward, 35-year-old woman who frequently finds herself in bizarre situations.&lt;ref name="Miranda at www.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00w7dv9|title=Miranda at BBC.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123064515/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00w7dv9|archivedate=23 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is something of a misfit relative to her upper-middle-class, privately educated background, opting to invest an inheritance from her uncle in a joke/gift shop rather than pursuing what her mother perceives as a more "respectable" career, and balking at the supposedly "suitable" men that her mother and friends try to set her up with. Miranda struggles with everyday adult life, often indulging in odd, childlike behaviour (including adding faces and clothes to pieces of fruit and vegetables, dubbing them "Fruit Friends" and "Vegeta-Pals") and getting thrown out of numerous establishments. Although this often irritates her friends and family, they tolerate her because, at heart, she is intelligent and good-natured, despite not always showing it. In the final episode, after she breaks up with Gary, some of her awkward and childish behaviour disappears; this causes considerable concern for her friends and mother, who organise a therapy session. However, she finally accepts that her only serious problem – her lack of confidence – is now gone and although she does not need Gary, she does indeed love him. After an initial panic over an unexpected wedding, she marries Gary at his restaurant.
* [[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]] as Gary Preston – A handsome, friendly chef; an old university friend of Miranda's. Although there has always been an undercurrent of attraction between them, neither has pursued it until he begins working at the restaurant next to Miranda's shop. Despite often being confused by Miranda's behaviour, Gary generally finds her kind, open nature endearing, especially as she is willing to help him out when needed. Gary is more confident and worldly than Miranda, but he shares her insecurity in romantic situations, and occasionally becomes embroiled in odd situations with her {{mdash}} for example, the pretence that they have sons called "Cliff" and "Richard" when challenged by a customer in the shop. He is one of the few people who accepts Miranda as she is. Miranda and Gary date briefly in series two, though this breaks down when it is revealed Gary was married (for a green card) to a waitress that Miranda had befriended at the restaurant. Gary also dates Rose briefly in series three, before breaking up with her due to her being unable to accept Miranda. After becoming engaged, Miranda becomes concerned that he has never said he loves her. When she confronts him, Gary tells Miranda that her distinctive lack of confidence in herself means that they can never truly be together. In the final episode, when Miranda accepts herself, she rushes to what she believes is Gary's wedding, where he is actually best man for his former boss Clive. Gary reveals he has already decided that he loves Miranda and offers to elope; she decides that she does not need to run away and marries Gary at Clive's reception.
* [[Sarah Hadland]] as Stevie Sutton – Miranda's childhood friend, and the assistant manager of the joke shop (although in reality she does most of the work due to Miranda's lack of business sense). She is generally more level-headed and ambitious than Miranda, but is not averse to becoming involved in her strange behaviour, or indeed indulging in some of her own, including frequently performing [[Heather Small]]'s "[[Proud (Heather Small song)|Proud]]" while holding a cardboard cut-out of the singer whenever she is pleased with herself.&lt;ref name="Miranda -"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idNNIUUg5NE|title=Miranda – Stevie sings "Proud" on YouTube|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215114105/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idNNIUUg5NE|archivedate=15 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, Miranda and Stevie often get into petty arguments and competitions, such as when a customer leaves his wallet and both Miranda and Stevie attempt to impress him. Miranda frequently mocks Stevie for her small stature, and frequently pushes her over when she irritates Miranda. Despite often claiming to have "the allure" and mocking Miranda's attempts with men, Stevie also shares Miranda's lack of success, sometimes coming across as desperate when she chats someone up. She occasionally uses an unkempt and unpleasant traffic warden (played by [[Joe Wilkinson]]) as a date when trying to compete with Miranda. In the final episode, the traffic warden appears again and Stevie kisses him to avoid getting a [[parking ticket]].
* [[Patricia Hodge]] as Penny – Miranda's middle-class mother, a "lady who lunches", who likes to impress her friends and fellow [[Women's Institutes|W.I.]] members. Her main mission in life is to find Miranda a man and a better job. She despairs at Miranda's decision to run a joke/gift shop, and her tendency to reject suitable (or at least available) men, on numerous occasions trying to set up Miranda with her cousin. Although often embarrassed by her daughter, Penny displays many of Miranda's erratic traits and often teams up with Miranda for their benefit, such as when they are in the psychiatrist's office. Despite being prepared to humiliate Miranda for her own gain (to the point of holding up a placard offering to pay someone to marry Miranda), Penny's actions are borne out of genuine love and concern, and on the rare occasions where Miranda is doing well she shows her love by cheering "Go Miranda". Penny's catchphrase, "Such fun!" is normally used to describe an activity or event where she believes Miranda may find a husband. Another catchphrase of Penny's, especially in the first series, is 'What I call', which she says before numerous everyday things before Miranda points out that that is simply the word for it, and not just what Penny calls it (for example, 'I'm meeting a friend for a spot of, what I call, tea.') Penny tends to ignore Miranda's obvious disinterest or discomfort. &lt;!-- When two men proposes to Miranda at once in the final episode of series three, Penny desperately screams "just say YES!", not even caring at this point which man she says it to.&lt;ref name="Miranda - proposal scene @ YouTube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7EOmCd0kn0|title=Miranda – proposal scene}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;  In the final episode, Penny turns up at Miranda's flat two days after her break-up with Gary, insensitively suggesting they simply find another groom. Miranda finally loses her temper and tells Penny to get out; this causes Penny to go on a drinking binge at her local tennis club. She soon turns up at Miranda's flat and tearfully confesses that her relationship with Miranda's father has been dead for some time. Thanks to her daughter's new confidence, Penny regains her dignity and joyfully embraces Miranda when she marries Gary several days later.
* [[Sally Phillips]] as Tilly – An old school friend of Miranda's and the daughter of Penny's never-seen friend Belinda, who fits right in with their private school background, often showing more in common with Penny than Miranda does. Tilly is a socialite and normally quite self-centred, though on occasion, she does come through for her friends and shows that she is kind and generous. She will often address Miranda by her school nickname, "Queen Kong" (due to Miranda's stature and clumsiness), despite Miranda's displeasure, but her criticisms and attempts to help Miranda are generally well intentioned. Tilly's catchphrase is "bear with", usually said as she breaks off conversations to read text messages. While seeming more confident and together than Miranda, she has her own problems romantically, particularly when her fiancé, Rupert (played by [[Adam James (actor)|Adam James]]), makes a pass at Miranda behind her back. In the penultimate episode, she becomes engaged to her army doctor boyfriend, "Dreamboat" Charlie (played by [[Adrian Scarborough]]). The final episode sees Miranda give Tilly tickets to [[Wick, Caithness|Wick]] so she can be free of her mother and elope with Charlie.
* [[James Holmes (actor)|James Holmes]] as Clive Evans (2009–2010, 2015) – The [[camp (style)|camp]], vicious-tongued owner of the restaurant where Gary works. He is usually more of a hindrance than help whenever he attempts to help Miranda and Gary get together, accidentally revealing, for example, that Gary has a secret wife from [[Hong Kong]] named Tamara (played by [[Stacy Liu]]). Despite his jibes at Miranda, he does show traits of wanting to help her, such as when he pushes her to tell Gary his true feelings. He is absent from the third series having sold the restaurant to Gary off-screen. Clive returns in the final episode and marries the regular customer from previous episodes (played by [[Dominic Coleman]]).
* [[Bo Poraj]] as Michael Jackford (2012–2014) – Miranda's new boyfriend who works as a television reporter and loves Miranda for the real her. Michael made his final appearance in the penultimate episode, when Miranda peacefully turned down his marriage proposal in order to accept Gary's. In the final episode, Penny mentions that the character has flown to Africa, where he had previously returned from on a business venture.
* [[Naomi Bentley]] as Rose (2013) – Gary's new girlfriend. When Rose can't accept his past affections for Miranda, Gary breaks up with her. She is last seen entering Gary's restaurant for its re-opening, but when Miranda confesses her true feelings for Gary during an argument, Rose immediately walks out.
* [[Katy Wix]] as Fanny (2009) – Another socialite friend of Miranda's from boarding school. She appears during the first series&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2360449/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t16|title=Katy Wix|work=IMDb|accessdate=8 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802075340/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2360449/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t16|archivedate=2 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside Tilly, but is not mentioned or seen as of the second series.&lt;ref name="imdb.com"/&gt;
* [[John Finnemore (writer)|John Finnemore]] and [[Margaret Cabourn-Smith]] as Chris and Alison (2009–2010, 2013–2014) – Sort-of friends of Gary and Miranda. As university students, Chris and Alison agreed to marry each other if they were still single at a certain age, but Chris whisked Alison away to Paris and proposed. During the second series, Alison becomes pregnant and they decide that Gary and Miranda should be godparents, but Miranda freaks out when they reveal she will also act as Alison's birthing partner. In the third series, Miranda, Gary and Rose babysit for them. They make their final appearance in the penultimate episode; their once joyous marriage now strained.
* [[Dominic Coleman]] (2009, 2013, 2015) as 'Customer' – A [[homosexual|gay]] man who comes into the store on three occasions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0171015/|title=Dominic Coleman|work=IMDb|accessdate=8 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414071035/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0171015/|archivedate=14 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually with the intention of buying something for his niece, but is distracted by the probing questions of Stevie and Miranda and gets roped into their antics (For example, suggesting Miranda should lie about being gay and then being roped into attending her coming out party.) He features in the final episode as the partner of Clive,&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04wtcsd|title=BBC One – Miranda, Specials, The Final Curtain|work=BBC|accessdate=8 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426011643/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04wtcsd|archivedate=26 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose wedding Miranda gatecrashes. Although never mentioned on screen, he is referred to on the BBC's website as 'Jim'.

Abigail Wilson, who worked for comedians [[Dawn French]] and [[Jennifer Saunders]], suggested Hart pitch a show to the BBC after seeing her perform in 2003.&lt;ref name="Times-Maxwell" /&gt; Following a read-through of her script with Saunders and BBC executives,&lt;ref name="Times-Maxwell" /&gt; a television pilot, based on her semi-autobiographical writing, was filmed in early 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2009/11/get-ready-for-miranda.shtml|title=BBC Comedy Blog: Get ready for ''Miranda''|last=Hart|first=Miranda|authorlink=Miranda Hart|date=9 November 2009|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228151534/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2009/11/get-ready-for-miranda.shtml|archivedate=28 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the series was then developed into a sitcom for radio;&lt;ref name="Times-Maxwell" /&gt; ''Miranda Hart's Joke Shop'' aired on [[BBC Radio 2]] in August and September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00d3hzr|title=''Miranda Hart's Joke Shop''|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=9 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624120548/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00d3hzr|archivedate=24 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A television series was commissioned in August 2008 and began filming in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/08_august/22/comedy.shtml|title=New BBC Two comedy: ''In My Country'' starring Omid Djalili, ''Miranda Hart's Joke Shop'' and ''Rab C Nesbitt'' returns|work=BBC Press Office|publisher=BBC|date=22 August 2008|accessdate=10 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106023056/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/08_august/22/comedy.shtml|archivedate=6 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/06_june/18/miranda.shtml|title=Miranda starts filming with an all-star cast for her new sitcom on BBC Two|work=BBC Press Office|publisher=BBC|date=18 June 2009|accessdate=3 November 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622192932/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/06_june/18/miranda.shtml|archivedate=22 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outdoor shots for series one were filmed in Hounslow, West London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Miranda |last=Hart |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2009/11/get-ready-for-miranda.shtml |title=Comedy Blog: Get ready for Miranda |publisher=BBC |date=9 November 2009 |accessdate=4 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102221505/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2009/11/get-ready-for-miranda.shtml |archivedate=2 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the BBC's Writersroom, Hart said of the semi-autobiographical basis for the series:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Well I developed this stand-up persona, and that's where it all started from. I realised I was getting laughs being a version of me, and that's what ended up in the sitcom. You do ultimately start from yourself but I'm pleased to say I did have to exaggerate for comedic effect. It wasn't entirely autobiographical. I'm not quite that mad.&lt;ref name="Writersroom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/insight/miranda_hart1.shtml|title=Miranda Hart|date=December 2009|work=BBC Writersroom|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213204628/http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/insight/miranda_hart1.shtml|archivedate=13 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Series 1 (2009) ===

Each episode begins with a welcome to audience and a 'Previously in my life ...' segment, and Hart says a joke shop is the "right place" as the setting after being asked to consider an office to "normalise" the character.&lt;ref name="Writersroom"/&gt; Her love of 1970s comedy programmes, such as ''[[Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em]]'', is the influence for ''Miranda''. The episodes end with a 'You have been watching ...' credits section where each cast member waves goodbye, as seen concluding [[Jimmy Perry]] and [[David Croft (TV producer)|David Croft]] sitcoms such as ''[[Dad's Army]]'' and ''[[Hi-de-Hi!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/entertainment-chester/chester-cinema-film-tv/2009/11/09/miranda-hart-harks-back-to-tv-golden-age-59067-25124626/|title=Miranda Hart harks back to TV golden age|work=Chester Chronicle|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|first=Andy|last=Welch|date=9 November 2009|accessdate=4 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227075127/http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/entertainment-chester/chester-cinema-film-tv/2009/11/09/miranda-hart-harks-back-to-tv-golden-age-59067-25124626/|archivedate=27 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quoted in ''[[The Times]]'', Hart says "I'm saying this is what I'm doing and I'm not scared to do it. Some of my comedy peers do slightly fear being a mainstream figure, as if it's slightly uncool. Well, I thought I'm going to embrace it."&lt;ref name="Times-Maxwell" /&gt; Throughout each episode, Hart breaks the [[fourth wall]] and addresses the audience directly, a technique described as a "simple creative decision [that] makes this infectious comedy sing";&lt;ref name=4th&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/miranda_hart_sitcom/press/|title=Miranda – Reviews and Articles – British Comedy Guide|publisher=The British Comedy Guide|accessdate=31 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114065806/http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/miranda_hart_sitcom/press|archivedate=14 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; another critic stated "this is hard to pull off, but it works well".&lt;ref name = 4th/&gt;

=== Specials (2014–2015) ===
Due to the cliffhanger at the end of the third series, it was suspected that ''Miranda'' would return for a fourth series. However, in July 2014, Hart announced that there are no plans for a fourth series but 'a couple of specials' would be made.&lt;ref name=specials/&gt; Hart later announced that the two Christmas specials would be the end to the sitcom. Hart said the end was "going to be really emotional," but added that she didn't want her sitcom character "to keep falling over and making a fool of herself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/story/000001638/miranda_hart_confirms_sitcom_end/|title=Miranda Hart confirms an end to her hit sitcom|date=23 October 2014|accessdate=23 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024171214/http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/story/000001638/miranda_hart_confirms_sitcom_end/|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future ===
At the end of the final episode, Miranda said to the audience/viewers: "I don't know when and if I'll see you again..." In June 2015, Miranda Hart revealed that she hadn't ruled out a possible return for ''Miranda''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/tv-radio/582430/Miranda-Hart-return-Tom-Ellis-Gary-sitcom|title=Miranda Hart is not ruling out sitcom return with children – TV &amp; Radio – Showbiz &amp; TV – Daily Express|author=Neela Debnath|work=Express.co.uk|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah Hadland has suggested that the sitcom is set to return. Speaking in an interview with The Telegraph, the actress – who plays Miranda's friend Stevie in the show – confirmed that the comedy will be back "in some format". However, she wouldn't be drawn on specifics, just saying: "I can say there will be something".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/10/16/sarah-hadland-miranda-is-coming-back/|title=Sarah Hadland: 'Miranda is coming back'|author=Jasper Rees|access-date=4 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104210326/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/10/16/sarah-hadland-miranda-is-coming-back/|archivedate=4 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late May 2017, Tom Ellis suggested the possibility of future episodes in an interview on [[BBC Radio 2]], saying that "we may be revisiting Miranda in the next couple of years".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3703228/hit-comedy-miranda-is-set-to-make-shock-return-two-years-after-the-finale-saw-character-marry-gary/|title=Miranda is to make a shock return two years after the hit comedy's 'finale' saw character marry Gary|date=2017-06-01|work=The Sun|access-date=2017-06-01|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603065425/https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3703228/hit-comedy-miranda-is-set-to-make-shock-return-two-years-after-the-finale-saw-character-marry-gary/|archivedate=3 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main cast of ''Miranda'' (aside from Ellis and Holmes), reunited for the 2017 [[Royal Variety Performance]], for which Hart was the host. They appeared several times throughout the evening in character.

==American remake==
In August 2018, it was reported that ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' star [[Jim Parsons]] was developing a US remake for [[Warner Bros. Television]]. Hart would be involved in developing the remake as a producer, but it was not revealed if she would star as well. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.spoilertv.com/2018/08/miranda-jim-parsons-developing-us.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

The first series was picked as one of the top 10 forthcoming TV shows for Autumn 2009 by ''[[The Sunday Times]]''.&lt;ref name="Sally" /&gt; Ahead of the first episode airing, Dominic Maxwell in an article for ''[[The Times]]'' described it as an "old-school" sitcom and said that "It's good fun, if you buy into it. And if you do, it's because of Hart."&lt;ref name="Times-Maxwell" /&gt; Also describing it as "old-fashioned", Vicky Frost for ''[[The Guardian]]'' said of the [[slapstick]] physical comedy that "It's not clever – but it is funny. And that, I think is at the heart of Miranda's appeal."&lt;ref name="mean vicky" /&gt; Mark Wright for ''[[The Stage]]'' said that Hodge gives a "brilliant, brilliant performance" and that "what sets ''Miranda'' out as something special is Hart herself, and the rest just gels around her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2009/11/why-we-love-miranda/|title=Why We Love ''Miranda''|last=Wright|first=Mark|work=[[The Stage]]|publisher=The Stage Newspaper Limited|date=24 November 2009|accessdate=9 December 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126050107/http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2009/11/why-we-love-miranda/|archivedate=26 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first series opened with 2.63&amp;nbsp;million viewers (10% audience share), rising to 3.14&amp;nbsp;million viewers (12% share) for the fourth episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-30?|title=Weekly Top 30 Programmes – BBC2 w/e 15 Nov 2009|publisher=[[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]]|accessdate=30 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wSLX6Azh?url=http://www.barb.co.uk/report/weeklyTopProgrammesOverview|archivedate=13 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-30?|title=Weekly Top 30 Programmes – BBC2 w/e 6 Dec 2009|publisher=[[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]]|accessdate=30 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wSLX6Azh?url=http://www.barb.co.uk/report/weeklyTopProgrammesOverview|archivedate=13 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tonight was also the first we saw of Miranda's father, played by Tom Conti, who filled most of the episode's falling-over quota, so that Miranda finally remained pretty vertical throughout the episode."&lt;ref name="Metro"/&gt; She added that Hart is "a great observer of everyday dilemmas" and the best thing of all is she left the door open for a third series.&lt;ref name="Metro"/&gt; Dominic Cavendish of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' called ''Miranda'' "the sitcom of the year",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8209865/Miranda-Im-the-friend-you-can-laugh-at.html|title=Miranda: 'I'm the friend you can laugh at'|last=Cavendish|first=Dominic|date=21 December 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=22 December 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228032950/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8209865/Miranda-Im-the-friend-you-can-laugh-at.html|archivedate=28 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Chris Harvey of the same newspaper said "The truth is, pretty much every time Miranda turns and looks at the camera, I burst out laughing. And even when her slapstick is so obvious it wouldn't confuse a small child [..] I still laugh. Even when I'm trying not to. Even when I really, really don't want to."&lt;ref name="LoveHate"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8215227/Miranda-love-her-or-hate-her.html|title=Miranda: love her or hate her?|last=Gee|first=Catherine|author2=Harvey, Chris|date=21 December 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=22 December 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224062607/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8215227/Miranda-love-her-or-hate-her.html|archivedate=24 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Catherine Gee said the show was a flop and listed six reasons why, which included unoriginal jokes, Hart's asides to the camera and the show retaining "the worst aspects of the sitcoms of yesteryear."&lt;ref name="LoveHate"/&gt;

The opening episode of the third series became one of the most watched shows in the UK over the Christmas period, attracting a total audience of over 11.5 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9769498/Why-Miranda-is-now-bigger-than-EastEnders.html|title=Why Miranda is now bigger than EastEnders|last=Deacon|first=Michael|date=28 December 2012|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=30 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121229222212/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9769498/Why-Miranda-is-now-bigger-than-EastEnders.html|archivedate=29 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For The Telegraph, Michael Deacon compares the programme to a childish Christmas panto, finally adding, "Perhaps I’m just getting old.

[[George Entwistle]] stated, "Miranda's been a tremendous hit with audiences on BBC Two and I'm very glad she's let us persuade her to move to BBC One, where we believe we can build an even bigger following for her multi-award-winning show. BBC Two has done an exceptional job of supporting and nurturing Miranda over a number of years and I'm certain she'll be equally well looked after at BBC One."&lt;ref name="LeavesBBC2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2011/02/10/miranda-moves-to-bbc1-after-two-series-on-bbc2-637931/|title=Miranda leaves BBC2 for third series on BBC1|date=10 February 2011|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|accessdate=10 April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223003015/http://metro.co.uk/2011/02/10/miranda-moves-to-bbc1-after-two-series-on-bbc2-637931/|archivedate=23 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''San Miguel de Escalada''' is a monastery in the province of [[León (province)|León]], [[Spain]], located 10&amp;nbsp;km from the [[Way of St. James]] pilgrimage route to [[Santiago de Compostela]]. The building is an example of [[Mozarabic art and architecture]] or [[Repoblación art and architecture]].

==History==
An inscription that has disappeared but was published by Father Risco in 1786&lt;ref&gt;Sacred Spain, tome XXXV, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; gave information about the church's consecration in 951 by Bishop Genadio of Astorga, around the time of the founding of the [[Kingdom of León]]. It was constructed on a site dedicated to Saint Michael, probably a Visigothic church:&lt;ref name="inscription"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://descargas.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/12928307727836051098435/022650.pdf?incr=1|title=
San Miguel de Escalada. Inscripciones y documentos|work=Boletín de la Real Academia de la Historia, tomo 31 (1897), pp. 466-515 |accessdate=October 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Hic locus antiquitus Michaelis archangeli honore dicatus, brevi opere unstructus, post ruinis abolitus, diu mansit dirutus; donec Adefonsus abba cum sociis adveniens cordubensi patria edis ruinam erexit sub valente sereno Adefonso principe.

As the number of monks increase, at length they determine the wonderful work of enlarging the current temple from its foundations.

In the era nine hundred and fifty one. The temple was consecrated by the bishop Genadio.}}

[[Image:SMdE interior.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Monastery of San Miguel de Escalada: interior]]
In 1050, due to an increase in the number of monks, the foundation was renewed by the Abbot Sabarico. In 1155 King [[Alfonso VII of León]] gave the monastery to the congregation of ''St Rufo of Avignon''.

After the disentailment of ecclesiastical properties and lands in 1836 (''[[Desamortización de Mendizábal]]''), the monastery was abandoned and the monastic offices disappeared. The only buildings extant are the church, the tower, and the San Fructuoso chapel. The tower and the chapel are of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style.  Later in the nineteenth century the buildings were declared a [[National Monument (Spain)|national monument]].

==Architecture==
The monastery church's [[nave]] has three aisles separated by columns and large [[horseshoe arch]]es, with their [[apses]] and a [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]], which is not covered by a [[dome|cimborio]] or central tower. The choir is separated from the principal nave by three horseshoe arches sometimes called an [[iconostasis]]).

Despite the floor plan, the building appears from the exterior as a rectangular block. All arches take down in marble shafts and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] steeples proceeding from other Visigothic or Roman constructions (as it may be appreciated in a [[Molding (decorative)|cyma]] carved as from a gravestone, perhaps from the nearby Roman city of ''Lancia'').{{Clarify|date=June 2010}}

The building has wood panels, which are decorated with paintings from the 15th century.

Architectural highlights include a meridional porch fixed by twelve horseshoe arche), which were built in two different phases: the seven occidental arches, with columns and steeples are in the [[Moorish architecture|moorish]] style, while the [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic]] work from the 10th century is preserved in the [[alfiz]] decorations around the arches.

'''Museumsufer''' is the name of a landscape of museums in [[Frankfurt]], [[Hesse]], Germany, lined up on both banks of the river [[Main (river)|Main]] or in close vicinity. The centre is the historic art museum [[Städel]]. The other museums were added, partly by transforming historic villas, partly by building new museums, in the 1980s by cultural politician [[Hilmar Hoffmann]].

== History ==
The idea for a group of different museums in Frankfurt was proposed in 1977 by [[Hilmar Hoffmann]], who was then as  ''Kulturdezernent'' responsible for culture in the city.&lt;ref&gt;''Frankfurter Wochenschau'' of 1 February 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Before, architect {{ill|Till Behrens|de}} had proposed a concept {{ill|Frankfurter Grüngürtel|de}} to the forum for development (''Frankfurter Forum für Stadtentwicklung''). Between 1980 and 1990, existing museums were expanded and many new ones built, often including historic villas.&lt;ref name="Breidecker" /&gt; Architects included internationally known [[Richard Meier]], [[Oswald Mathias Ungers]], [[Josef Paul Kleihues]], [[Günter Behnisch]] and [[Hans Hollein]].&lt;ref name="Dornberg" /&gt;

Beginning in 2008, Frankfurt has restored and expanded some of it museums.g The [[Städel]] was expanded by an annex, and the [[Deutsches Filminstitut|Fil Museum]] was renovated.

[[File:Cajun jam session 3 Festival Acadiens 2010.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Cajun music]] "jam session"]]
A '''music session''' is a social gathering of [[musicians]] and [[singer]]s who perform music in a relatively informal context. Much of the music performed at such events is [[traditional music]] for the area, [[popular music|popular song]]s and other well-known tunes. In sessions, the participants typically [[music improvisation|improvise]] the [[accompaniment]], [[arrangement (music)|song arrangements]] and [[ornament (music)|musical ornaments]] to the melodies of [[song]]s or tunes. The venue may be a public bar, tavern, village hall or a private home.

The events usually occur at regular intervals and a weekday evening may be chosen if professional musicians are expected to take part, so that it does not interfere with paid weekend gigs. More amateur players may organize a session on a weekend. At a session, musicians usually play or sing for pleasure and to socialize. Frequently the musicians and singers are unpaid. However, one or two musicians (usually experienced players or professionals) are paid to 'lead' a session and to encourage others to join in. In a jazz or blues jam, the venue may pay a small "house band" (typically a [[rhythm section]]) to provide [[accompaniment]].

==Terminology==
[[File:High Bridge Trail State Park jam session (8144785056).jpg|thumb|right|200px|An outdoor jam session with acoustic instruments.]]
Depending on the genre and region, music sessions may be called a "traditional music session",  "session", or in [[jazz]] and [[blues]], a "[[jam session]]" or "jam".

==  Cultural role ==
The music session forms an important part of Scottish and Irish culture (see [[Irish traditional music session]]).  Often such events form an integral part of [[music festival]]s. The festival will often consist of a series of concerts by local groups, well-known or famous bands or entertainers.  It is quite common for the local amateurs and touring professional musicians to meet after the concerts and have a "session" late in the evening. These sessions may continue into early hours of the morning. In jazz and blues, "jam sessions" are an important part of the musical culture.

== Instruments ==

===Scottish and Irish traditional music===
[[Image:Mulligans session.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Irish music enthusiasts gather at a pub to play and drink beer]]
{{Main|Irish traditional music session}}
Usually traditional sessions are based around acoustic instruments. In Scotland as in Ireland, the most popular instruments include [[acoustic guitar]], [[fiddle]], [[accordion]], [[mandolin]], pipes, whistle, and sometimes [[double bass]].   Because an acoustic guitar is relatively quiet, guitarists often experience difficulty being heard over louder instruments such as accordions and whistles.

A small amplifier may be used to bring the guitar up to an audible level.  However, there are a number of traditionalists who resent the use of [[guitar amplifier]]s at an otherwise acoustic session.

Depending on the session, some beginning performers may use [[chord progression|chord charts]] or [[sheet music]] or no [[music notation]] at all, which is typically the case at a session with experienced participants and/or professionals. In sessions where no music notation is used, the participants or leader "call" well-known tunes that the other performers know "by ear", either by stating the title aloud, or more simply by starting into the melody.

===Jazz and blues===
[[File:Blues Perlan 2014 Blueberry Jam Session.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A 2014 blues jam.]]
{{Main|Jam session}}
In [[jazz]] and [[blues]] (and related genres and subgenres), a session is typically called a '''jam session''' or a '''jam'''. Jam sessions often take place after musicians and singers have finished their paid gigs for the evenings. Jams often take place at [[nightclub]]s or bars. Jams may include both professional instrumentalists and singers and talented amateurs. Some venues have a "house band" or [[backing band]], a paid [[rhythm section]] that includes one or two chordal instrumentalists (e.g., [[piano]], [[Hammond organ]], [[electric guitar]], etc.), a bassist (e.g., [[electric bass]] or [[double bass]]) and a [[drummer]].

In jazz, jam participants include "horn players" ("horn" in jazz parlance means any of the wind or brass instruments used in the genre, including [[saxophone]], [[trumpet]], [[trombone]], etc), rhythm section instrumentalists (who typically "sit in for" or replace one of the house band members) and singers. At more amateur jazz jam sessions, the performers may use [[lead sheet]]s that contain the [[chord progression]] and [[melody]] of the song in [[music notation]] or [[fake book]]s. At a more professional jam, performers may simply "call out" tunes, with the performers being expected to know the melody and chord changes.

At a blues jam, the session performers may include [[electric guitarist]]s, [[harmonica]] ("blues harp") players and singers. At blues jams, the house band typically plays [[twelve bar blues]] and other blues song forms that are well-known for the session participants to solo over. At blues jams, the [[guitar solo]], typically played on [[electric guitar]] through an [[Distortion (music)|overdriven]] [[guitar amp]], is an important type of solo.

==Role of leader==
[[File:C - Jam Session at El Chalten Minimarket.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A jam session at El Chalten market.]]
Paid session leaders help to ensure that there will be music performances throughout the evening for members of the public who might wish to listen without participating. The leader also acts as a host and [[master of ceremonies]] for the event, introducing performers and, thanking them after their songs and calling for applause. The session leader selects players and singers who are skilled enough to deserve a solo performance, and politely asks inexperienced performers to wait for later in the session.

If a session performer is exceptionally skilled, the leader may encourage her to perform a number of songs or tunes. On the other hand, if a player or singer does not perform that well, due to a lack of experience or technique, the leader will thank the individual for his or her performance and then diplomatically ask for the audience's applause, while at the same time inviting a more seasoned performer on stage to take the first performer's place. Less skilled performers may be asked to participate as a member of an ensemble, playing an [[accompaniment]] role in the background.

Some session leaders use a sign-up sheet where participants can indicate their interest in performing. The session leader is often an accomplished singer and/or instrumentalist, and she typically performs throughout the evening, either in solo roles or "comping" for (accompanying) other performers. The session leader's ability to perform helps to fill in any periods during the evening where no participants have asked to come up.

==Purpose and recompense==
The performers and singers who participate in an unpaid session typically do so for the enjoyment of performing and for the applause they receive from the audience. In jazz, jam sessions are often a good way for players and singers to meet other performers; in a sense, it can serve as a form of [[business networking]] for musicians. At a jam session, jazz musicians can hear other performers on stage, meet with them, and consider certain individuals for collaboration on future paid gigs or recording sessions. A jazz singer, for example, might use attendance and participation in jam sessions as a way to find potential members who she could hire as a [[rhythm section]] for her shows. A [[bandleader]] might use participation in jam sessions as a way to scout out new talent for her [[big band]]. In jazz, jam sessions are also an opportunity for informal learning, as players can show other performers new playing techniques or [[jazz improvisation|improvisation]] approaches.

The hospitality of the landlord or venue owner can also be important to the music session scene. Sometimes he or she might offer a round of drinks or tea, coffee and food to the performers, to thank them for their contribution to the entertainment of the audience.

==Paid concerts==
As part of [[jazz festival]]s, the organizers sometimes arrange what are termed "jam sessions", which are concerts in which only professional musicians perform. While these shows may share the informal feel of regular jam sessions, they are different from the truly informal jam sessions that are held, at which both professionals and talented amateurs share the stage, and at which none of the solo performers (except the host/MC) are being paid.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2146">'''Payasos Sin Fronteras''', or '''Clowns without Borders''', is a [[Spain|Spanish]] humanitarian organization of [[clown]]s that performs for free for children affected by war. It was founded in [[Barcelona]] in July 1993 and has performed in many war-torn regions such as former [[Yugoslavia]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] or eastern [[Democratic republic of Congo|DR Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7967869.stm |title = Clowns bring smiles to DR Congo |work=[[BBC]] |date = 27 March 2009|accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.clowns.org/ |title = Payasos sin fronteras |date = 27 March 2009 | accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In 1992, a professional clown from Barcelona received a request from a group of students at the Projecte School in Barcelona to put on shows in refugee camps in the former Yugoslavia. The students offered to accompany the clowns and pay for the costs.
On 26 February 1993, the artists performed in the Veli Joze refugee camp on the Istrian peninsula. The reaction from the children validates the impact and the clowns decided to put on a second show two months later with a group of jugglers. This second trip cemented the idea of setting up an organization. 
In 1992, different artist groups from Spain (clowns, dancers, magicians, etc.) launched 8 trips to the former Yugoslavia and invited other international artists to participate. In 1994 there were 19 trips and in the following years, similar organizations were founded in Belgium, Canada, Germany, Ireland, South Africa, Sweden, USA, Finland and Australia. In 2012, these eleven organizations created an International Federation to improve communication and coordination among entities.

'''''Plan of a Novel, according to Hints from Various Quarters''''' is a short [[satire|satirical]] work by [[Jane Austen]], probably written in May 1816.&lt;ref name="Poplawski1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Poplawski|title=A Jane Austen Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hW-OXDSc3rAC&amp;pg=PA238|accessdate=4 September 2013|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30017-2|pages=238–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in complete form for the first time by [[Robert William Chapman (scholar)|R.

C. Southam|title=Jane Austen's Literary Manuscripts: A Study of the Novelist's Development Through the Surviving Papers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qIGvej3FKNgC&amp;pg=PA80|accessdate=4 September 2013|date=15 April 2006|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-8264-2592-8|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1815 Austen met the Rev. [[James Stanier Clarke]] in London. He had ideas for her fiction, including a novel to be based on a clergyman with a foothold in urban life, as well as the provincial rural settings she had used so far for clerics in her novels.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time (October 1815) she was staying with her brother in London negotiating the publication of ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'', which was then dedicated to the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] through the good offices of Clarke, who was the Prince's librarian.&lt;ref name="Poplawski1998"/&gt; Among Clarke's suggestions was a [[historical novel]] on the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|House of Coburg]]: Austen side-stepped with a disclaimer about her talents.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Lamont, ''Jane Austen and the Old'', The Review of English Studies New Series, Vol. 54, No. 217 (Nov., 2003), pp. 661-674, at p. 663. Published by: Oxford University Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3661480&lt;/ref&gt;  Clarke recommended that Austen should dedicate ''Emma ''to the Prince Regent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Myer|first1=Valerie Grosvenor|title=Jane Austen : obstinate heart : a biography|date=1997|publisher=Arcade Publ.|location=New York|isbn=9781559703871|page=215|edition=1. North American}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She did this, although she disapproved of his attitude towards his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Austen wrote in a letter to Martha Lloyd on 16 February 1813 of the Prince's infidelities and his wife: "I am resolved at least always to think that she would have been respectable, if the Prince had behaved only tolerably by her at first."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and humour of the ''Plan''==
The intention of the work was to set down the essential parts of the "ideal novel". Austen was following, and guying, the recommendations of Clarke.&lt;ref name="Poplawski1998"/&gt; The work was also influenced by some of Austen's personal circle with views on the novel of [[courtship]], and names are recorded in the margins of the manuscript;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Deborah Kaplan|title=Jane Austen Among Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wrpNvr_H0TUC&amp;pg=PA184|accessdate=4 September 2013|year=1994|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-4970-1|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; they included [[William Gifford]], her publisher, and her niece Fanny Knight.&lt;ref name="KeymerMee2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas Keymer|author2=Jon Mee|title=The Cambridge Companion to English Literature, 1740-1830|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JyvdbEUGX6sC&amp;pg=PA256|accessdate=4 September 2013|date=17 June 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00757-3|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Plan'' became a sort of family joke among the Austens. Some of its aspects parody contemporary works by authors such as [[Sophie Cottin]], [[Fanny Burney]], [[Anna Maria Porter]], and [[Mary Brunton]].&lt;ref name="KeymerMee2004"/&gt; The satire of the ''Plan'' was analysed by Austen's nephew [[James Edward Austen-Leigh]], in his biography ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'' (1869, expanded edition 1871).

The '''Quito School''' ('''''Escuela Quiteña''''') is a [[Latin American]] artistic tradition that constitutes essentially the whole of the professional artistic output developed in the territory of the [[Royal Audience of Quito]] — from [[Pasto]] and [[Popayán]] in the north to [[Piura]] and [[Cajamarca]] in the south — during the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period (1542-1824)]].&lt;ref&gt;Ximena Escudero-Albornoz and Ximena Escudero de Terán.

Ediciones del Banco de los Andes (1992). {{ISBN|9978-82-293-3}}, {{ISBN|978-9978-82-293-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially associated with the 17th and 18th centuries and was almost exclusively focused on the religious art of the [[Catholic Church]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Handelsman, Michael (2000), ''Culture and Customs of Ecuador'' (Series: Culture and Customs of Latin America and the Caribbean; Series editor: Peter Standish); Westport, Connecticut/London: Greenwood Press, pg 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Characterized by a mastery of the realistic and by the degree to which indigenous beliefs and artistic traditions are evident, these productions were among of the most important activities in the economy of the Royal Audience of Quito.&lt;ref&gt;Christiana Renate Borchart de Moreno. ''La Audiencia de Quito: aspectos económicos y sociales (siglos XVI-XVIII)''. Editorial Abya Yala (1998). {{ISBN|9978-72-084-7}}, {{ISBN|978-9978-72-084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the prestige of the movement even in Europe that it was said that [[King Carlos III]] of Spain (1716–1788), referring to one of its sculptors in particular, opined: "I am not concerned that Italy has [[Michelangelo]]; in my colonies of America I have the master [[Caspicara]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rivas, Julio (2012), [http://www.clave.com.ec/index.php?idSeccion=785|fechaacceso=05/03/2013 ''Un sitio llamado San Francisco'']; ''Revista Clave!'', Nov-Dec issue. [''No me preocupa que Italia tenga a [[Miguel Ángel]], en mis colonias de América yo tengo al maestro Caspicara.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The Quito School originated in the school of Artes y Oficios, founded in 1552 by the Franciscan priest [[Jodoco Ricke]], who together with Friar [[Pedro Bedon]] transformed the San Andrés seminary, where the first indigenous artists were trained. As a cultural expression, it is the result of a long process of acculturation between indigenous peoples and Europeans, and it is one of the richest expressions of [[Mestizo|miscegenation (''mestizaje'')]] and of [[syncretism]], in which the participation of the vanquished Indian is seemingly of minor importance as compared to the dominant European contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Ximena Escudero Albornoz and José María Vargas Arévalo. ''Historia y crítica del Arte Hispanoamericano, Real Audiencia de Quito: (siglos XVI, XVII y XVIII)''. Editorial Abya Yala (2000). {{ISBN|9978-04-562-7}}, {{ISBN|978-9978-04-562-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
As a product of cultural syncretism and miscegenation, the works of the Quito School are characterized by the combination and adaptation of European and Indigenous features. In its development, it reflected the styles prevailing in each period of Spain and thus contains [[renaissance]] and [[Mannerism|mannerist]] elements. During its height, it was eminently [[baroque]], concluding with a short [[rococo]] period leading to an incipient [[neoclassicism]] until the transition to the [[History of Ecuador (1830–60)|republican period]]. The Quito School also incorporated [[Flemish]], [[Culture of Italy|Italian]], and [[Moorish]] influences.

One of the common characteristics of the school is the technique of ''encarnado'' ("flesh-colored") — the simulation of the color of the flesh of the [European] human body — that makes the skin of sculptures appear more natural. Once the piece was perfectly cut and sanded, an artisan covered the wood with several layers of [[gesso]] with glue. Each layer was highly polished to achieve a perfectly smooth finish. Next, color was applied in various transparent layers, allowing an optical mix of overlapping colors. This began with the colors of shadows (blue, green, ocher), then light colors were applied (white, pink, yellow). and finally highlight colors were added (orange and red to cheeks, knees, and elbows of children; and dark blue, green, and violet for wounds and bruises of Christ or for stubble on a beardless figure).

Other typical characteristics include:
*Serpentine representation of the movement of bodies, especially in sculpture
*Application of [[watercolor|''aguada'' (watercolor)]] on top of [[gold leaf]] or silver paint, giving a special metallic sheen

The features indicating its indigenous roots include:
* "Quiteñization" of characters, with mixed traits and local costumes
* Frequent appearance of ancestral indigenous customs
* Location of the scenes within the Andean countryside or cities
* Presence of local flora and fauna, and the substitution of local plants for traditional European iconography

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44178">'''Richard Shusterman''' is an [[Americans|American]] [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[philosophy|philosopher]]. Known for his contributions to philosophical [[aesthetics]] and the emerging field of somaesthetics, currently he is the Dorothy F. Schmidt Eminent Scholar in the Humanities and Professor of Philosophy at [[Florida Atlantic University]].

==Biography and career==

Richard Shusterman was born on December 3, 1949, to a Jewish family living in [[Philadelphia]], USA. At the age 16 he left his home and went to [[Israel]], where he continued his education, studying English and philosophy at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. There he received a B.A. degree in English and Philosophy, and later an M.A. degree in philosophy (both degrees awarded magna cum laude). 
After teaching at different Israeli academic institutions, and receiving tenure at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev with an episode as a visiting fellow at [[St John's College, Oxford|St. John's College]], [[Oxford University]] during academic year 1984/85, Shusterman became an Associate Professor of Philosophy at [[Temple University]], [[Philadelphia]], USA in 1986. He was granted tenure in 1988 and promoted to full professor in 1991. He then served as chair of the philosophy department between the years of 1998–2004.
In 2004 Richard Shusterman left Temple University to become the [http://www.fau.edu/humanitieschair/ Dorothy F. Schmidt Eminent Scholar in the Humanities] at [[Florida Atlantic University]], [[Boca Raton]], where he also holds the rank of Professor in the departments of Philosophy and English.
Richard Shusterman has been married twice. From his first marriage in Israel, he has two sons and a daughter. He has one daughter from his second marriage, which ended in 2013.

During his years at the University of Jerusalem, Shusterman focused on [[analytic philosophy]]. The interest carried over with his doctoral dissertation at Oxford University; ''The Object of Literary Criticism'' which he wrote at St. John's College under the supervision of [[J. O. Urmson]] and defended in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richard|first=Shusterman|date=|year=1979|title=The object of literary criticism|url=https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:35aaee34-ecdb-45fd-8922-745efdf3403f|journal=|language=en|publisher=Oxford Research Archive|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published under the original title in 1984.
1988 saw the publication of Shusterman's second book, [[T. S. Eliot]] and the Philosophy of Criticism, and with it came a turn in his philosophical focus as well. Influenced by the work that produced the book and personal experiences, Shusterman's attention moved from analytic philosophy to [[pragmatism]]. He also began work to develop his own theory of pragmatist aesthetics; based on [[John Dewey]]’s [[aesthetics]] but augmented by the argumentative methods and tools of analytic philosophy.
His third book published, Pragmatist Aesthetics in 1992, brought a big breakthrough in Shusterman’s academic career. The book’s original approach to the problems of definition of art, organic wholes, interpretation, popular art, and the ethics of taste brought him international fame as the book was translated into 14 languages and several editions were published. Shusterman’s position was further strengthened by three subsequent publications: Practicing Philosophy in 1997, Performing Live in 2000, and Surface and Depth in 2002; in which he continued the pragmatist tradition, raising significant interest, provoking numerous critiques and stimulating debates not only among professional philosophers, but in the areas of literary and cultural studies as well.
In Practicing Philosophy, Shusterman introduces his concept of ‘somaesthetics’, which he elaborates in greater detail in Performing Live. Somaesthetics is the focus of Shusterman's two subsequent books, Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics (2008) and Thinking through the Body: Essays in Somaesthetics (2012). The first of these books, translated into seven languages, helped establish somaesthetics as an international, interdisciplinary project involving scholars from fields beyond philosophy, while the second book consolidated this movement toward the interdisciplinary approach by applying somaesthetics to various arts, and cultural practices.

In 2007, as a part of his project of developing somaesthetics, Shusterman established the [http://www.fau.edu/bodymindculture/ Center for Body, Mind, and Culture] at FAU.  He is a member of many editorial boards and has been allocated important grants and fellowships for his research; from the National Endowment of the Humanities, the [[Fulbright Commission]], and the [[Humboldt Foundation]].

One of the important factors influencing Shusterman's philosophy has been his international career. For instance, his work in France with [[Pierre Bourdieu]], the [[Sorbonne]], and the [[College International de Philosophie]] has allowed his pragmatism to engage and deploy the contemporary French philosophical tradition. His Fulbright Professorship in [[Berlin]] enabled his pragmatism to intersect more closely with contemporary German philosophy. Similarly, his years as a visiting research professor in [[Hiroshima]], Japan and in [[Beijing]] and [[Shandong]] in China facilitated his study of [[Asian philosophy]] and [[Zen]] practice.

Shusterman philosophy stretches beyond the confines of professional academic life. In 1995, he was a delegate member of the [[UNESCO]] project Philosophy and Democracy in the World, and for several years he directed the UNESCO project MUSIC: Music, Urbanism, Social Integration and Culture. In 2012 he prepared a project commissioned by UNESCO that aims to use the internet to stimulate international youth to immerse in dialogue about peace and violence, through the medium of art.  Recalling the classical Greek concept of education, the project is named PAIDEIA, an acronym that stands for Peace through Art and Internet Dialog for Education and Intercultural Association.  On a more local level, during the years 1998-2004, he organized and hosted a public discussion forum, titled “Dialogues on the Square”, at Philadelphia's main [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] bookstore, at Rittenhouse Square.  In 2002, he received his professional certification as a [[Feldenkrais]] practitioner, and he has worked since as a somatic educator and therapist.

==Philosophical work==

===Shusterman's place in the contemporary pragmatism===
Contemporary pragmatism can be divided into two sub-fields; the neo-classical and the [[Neopragmatism|neo-analytical]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., T. Rockmore, “On Classical and Neo-Analytic Forms of Pragmatism”, ''Metaphilosophy'' vol. 36, no. 3, April, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter has been well described by Richard Rorty, as an amalgam of the elements of classical pragmatism and analytic philosophy, which is sometimes supplemented, especially in Rorty's case, by the ideas of continental thinkers like Martin Heidegger.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., R. Rorty, “Truth without Correspondence to Reality”, in  ''Philosophy and Social Hope'' (London: Penguin 1999), p. 24-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The former, represented, among others, by Susan Haack, is more conservative in its development of the classical tradition and adopts a critical stance toward Rorty's interpretation thereof.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. S. Haack, “Pragmatism, Old and New”, ''Contemporary Pragmatism'', vol. 1, no. 1, June, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming this description is correct, Shusterman's pragmatism lies somewhere in the middle between the above-mentioned positions. Although his analytic background and acceptance of some of Rorty's ideas (he even subsumes his and Rorty's thought under a common category of “reconstructivist genealogical-poetic pragmatism”&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Pragmatism and Culture: Margolis and Rorty”, in ''Surface and Depth. Dialectics of Criticism and Culture'', (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;) seemingly make him a neo-analytic pragmatist, the stress he puts on the importance of the notion of experience, which Rorty would like to substitute with the notion of language, chimes perfectly with the neo-classical stance.

Besides classical pragmatism and analytic philosophy, Shusterman's interests touch varied traditions and disciplines: continental sociology ([[Pierre Bourdieu]]&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., R. Shusterman, “Cultural Analysis and the Limits of Philosophy: The Case of Bourdieu” in ''Surface and Depth''.&lt;/ref&gt;) and philosophy ([[Michel Foucault]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and Care of the Self: The Case of Foucault”, ''Monist'', 83, 2000; R. Shusterman “Entertainment: A Question for Aesthetics”, ''British Journal of Aesthetics'', 43, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;), Western body therapy ([[Moshe Feldenkrais]], [[F. Matthias Alexander]]&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “The Somatic Turn” in ''Performing Live'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;) as well as East-Asian thought ([[Confucius]]).&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Pragmatism and East-Asian Thought”, ''Metaphilosophy'', 35, 2004; R. Shusterman, “Pragmatist Aesthetics and East-Asian Philosophy”, ''Naked Punch'' (online edition), May, 2006; http://www.nakedpunch.com/shustermanchina.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

This diversity of interests and inspirations finds its reflection in the scope of Shusterman's philosophical work which embraces not only aesthetics, but also metaphysics, ethics, philosophy of language, political theory as well as metaphilosophy; in which he advocates the idea of philosophy as the art of living.

===Experience===

Experience serves as a basic category in Shusterman's pragmatism, both in terms of methodology (the pragmatist should always work from experience &lt;ref&gt;See R. Shusterman, ''Performing Live'', p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;) as well as ontology or epistemology (experience “is a transactional nexus of interacting energies connecting the embodied self and its environing world”&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Intellectualism and the Field of Aesthetics”, ''Revue Internationale de Philosophie'',  220, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;) but contrary to John Dewey, Shusterman does not engage in constructing a general metaphysical conception. He has, however, made significant comments on Dewey's insights &lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Pragmatism Between Aesthetic Experience and Aesthetic Education”, ''Studies in Philosophy and Education'', 22, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and defends Dewey's idea of immediate, nondiscursive experience against the criticism put forward by Richard Rorty.&lt;ref&gt;See R. Shusterman, "Somatic Experience. Foundation or Reconstruction?", in ''Practicing Philosophy: Pragmatism and the Philosophical Life'' (New York: Routledge,1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

While Rorty shares Dewey's commitment to debunk epistemological [[foundationalism]], he (Rorty) believes that the notion of language is better suited to achieve this goal, than the notion of immediate, non-discursive experience preferred by Dewey. Rorty further says that Dewey's theory itself collapses into a version of foundationalism, where immediate, non-discursive experience serves as evidence for particular knowledge claims.

To this, Shusterman replies that:
(a) The anti-foundationalist thrust of the notion of language is not as clear as Rorty sees it (in fact language has been frequently used as a foundationalist category)
(b) Dewey never really intended his theory of experience to be a kind of epistemological foundationalism, but rather wanted to celebrate the richness and value of immediate experience, including “the immediate dimension of somatic experience” and to emphasize the positive role such experience can play in improving the quality of human life. (The inspiration of body theorist-therapist F. M. Alexander is important here). Although he argues that Dewey's theory was ultimately spoiled by a kind of foundationalism (not the one Rorty accuses Dewey of but rather one asserting that the specific quality of immediate experience is the glue that makes coherent thought possible),
Shusterman believes that the philosophical value of experience can and should be reaffirmed in an anti-foundationalist form.

In Shusterman's and, also, Dewey's opinion, the eastern meditation practices repair perception for understanding our dependence on the society's moral order. Shusterman underlines that even if, as Rorty claims, [[Wilfrid Sellars]]’s critique of the myth of the given proves that immediate, non-discursive somatic experience cannot be integrated into epistemology, it does not preclude that this experience may be usefully deployed in philosophy as such, because to think otherwise would be to wrongly conflate all philosophy with one of its sub-disciplines, i.e. theory of cognition. And the fact that we can hardly imagine any form of application of the immediate somatic experience in the realm of philosophy is not a proof that this is impossible, but rather indicates that our conception of philosophy is dominated by an idealistic paradigm, naturally hostile to the body as such. The will to change this situation has been one of the reasons why Shusterman developed a philosophical sub-discipline devoted to the body and its experience: Somaesthetics.

===Definitions of art===

Shusterman also addresses the philosophical problems of defining art; by presenting both, meta-theoretical insights as well as definitions of his own.

On the meta-theoretical level he criticizes [[essentialist]], classificatory definitions of art (preferred by the traditional analytic philosophy), which he calls “wrapper definitions” since they aim “at the perfect coverage” of the [[Extension (semantics)|logical extension]] of the notion of art.&lt;ref&gt;See R. Shusterman, Surface and Depth, p. 179-181&lt;/ref&gt; Shusterman finds these definitions problematic, given art's contested value and nature as well as its unpredictable development in the future. He further argues that there is a goal for art definitions, which is more important than the conceptual coverage that is directional/transformational in “illuminating the special point and value of art or [...] improving art’s appreciation”.&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Pragmatism Between Aesthetic Experience and Aesthetic Education”, p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt;

He says that these ideas may converge, but since they may as well not, it is unacceptable to exclude any definitions only on the basis that they do not satisfy the standards of taxonomical validity, like e.g. evaluative definitions which nevertheless can be useful in their own way. Besides discussing the issue of wrapper definitions in general, Shusterman has also criticized particular definitions of that kind invented by [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] and [[Arthur Danto]].&lt;ref&gt;See R. Shusterman, ''Pragmatist Aesthetics'' (2000), p. 38-44. Cf. R. Shusterman, “Art in a Box: Danto” (chapter 10 of ''Surface and Depth'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Shusterman advocates a definition of art; as experience that is influenced by Dewey's definition with significant changes. While he accepts the majority of the elements central to the Dewey's conception of this experience (e.g., that it cannot be reduced to the private mental world of the subject being rather an interaction between the subject and the object), there are some he finds questionable (e.g. Dewey's insistence on the unity and coherence of aesthetic experience which Shusterman would like to supplement with aesthetics of rupture and fragmentation).
He says that Dewey was wrong to treat his definition of art as experience as a traditionalist wrapper definition, thus making it vulnerable to the valid charges, that it is both too narrow and too wide (there are some artworks which do not engender aesthetic experiences and, conversely, in some cases aesthetic experience accompanies phenomena which simply cannot be redefined as art, like natural beauty, e.g.). He further says that what Dewey should have done instead was to assign to it the directional and transformational role mentioned above. Conceived this way, Shusterman argues, the definition of art as experience has an undeniable value because even though it cannot embrace the whole extension of the concept of art it “underlines a crucial background condition, direction, and valued goal of art” (i.e. aesthetic experience) and also helps to widen “the realm of art by challenging the rigid division between art and action that is supported by definitions that define art as mimesis, poiesis, or the narrow practice defined by the institutional art world".&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Pragmatism and Criticism: A Response to three critics of ''Pragmatist Aesthetics''”, ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'', 16, 2002, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shusterman also advocates a definition of art as dramatization, which supplements the definition he has inherited from Dewey not only by illuminating art's nature from a slightly different angle, but also by serving a different, yet equally important purpose – the reconciliation of two prominent and, at the same time, conflicted aesthetic accounts of art: [[historicism]] and [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalism]]. Since the notion of dramatization involves, and harmonizes two important moments: of putting something into a formalized frame (e.g. “the frame of a theatrical performance”&lt;ref&gt;R.Shusterman, “Art as Dramatization,” in ''Surface and Depth''.&lt;/ref&gt;) and of intense experiential content that is framed, it presents itself as a potential synthesizing formula for historicism and naturalism which, Shusterman argues, can be reduced to emphasizing the formal institutional frame of art (historicism) or experiential intensity that characterizes art as such (naturalism).

Both of Shusterman's definitions have become the subject of many commentaries and criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Thomas Leddy and Paul C. Taylor defend Dewey’s original theory of art as experience against Shusterman’s criticism, while Ranjan Ghosh points out that the definition of art as dramatization is significantly consonant with the Indian concept of Rasa (see the secondary literature listed above). Cf J. J. Stuhr, "Practice, Semiotics, and the Limits of Philosophy", ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'', vol. 19, no. 1, 2005, p. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation===

Of the many debates that galvanize contemporary humanities, one of the most important one is devoted to the problem of interpretation. Shusterman has participated in it by co-editing a fundamental anthology “The Interpretive Turn”, as well as making his opinions known.
Shusterman's account of interpretation is constructed in opposition to both analytic aesthetics and [[deconstruction]], which are often said to constitute the two opposite poles of contemporary interpretive theory. As he claims, both of them share “a picture of understanding as the recapturing or reproducing of a particular [...] [“separate and autonomous”] meaning-object”, yet they differ as to whether such act is possible. Deconstructionists, assuming their protean vision of language as “systematic play of differences”, claim it is not, and hence deem every reading a “misreading”, while analytic aestheticians think otherwise, usually construing the objective work-meaning as “metaphysically fixed in the artwork” and identifying it with the intention of the artist or “semantic features of the work itself”.&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, ''Surface and Depth'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid both these extremes Shusterman proposes a conception of textual meaning inspired by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]](and his notion of [[language-game|language games]]) in which meaning is thought of as a correlate of understanding, the latter term being conceived as “an ability to handle or respond to [something] in certain accepted ways”&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, ''Pragmatist Aesthetics'' (2000), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; which, although shared and legitimized by the community, can be quite different and constitute many diverse “interpretation games”.
Interpretation, thus, is not an act (be it successful or inherently condemned to failure) of discovering the meaning of text, but rather of constructing it, or, as Shusterman would like to put it, of “making sense’” of text. One of the corollaries of this account is that correctness of interpretation is always relative to the “rules” (typically implicit) of a given interpretation game. Since there are many different incommensurable games existing at the same time and since some of them have undergone some significant changes over history (and some may even have disappeared from use), we can speak of a plurality of correct interpretations of the same text both in synchronic and diachronic dimensions. Another consequence of this theory is Shusterman's logical pluralism which claims not only that there can be different (even contradictory), yet equally true interpretations (that would be only a cognitive pluralism), but also that there are legitimate forms of approaching texts which do not even aim at interpretational truth or plausibility, but rather aim at other useful goals (e.g., providing pleasure or making an old text more relevant to contemporary readers).&lt;ref&gt;See R. Shusterman, “Logics of Interpretation: The Persistence of Pluralism”, in ''Surface and Depth'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Shusterman's contributions to the theory of interpretation is his critique of a widely held view he calls ‘hermeneutic universalism’, and attributes to [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Alexander Nehamas]] and [[Stanley Fish]], among others. Agreeing with basic anti-foundationalist thrust of the hermeneutic universalists’ position, Shusterman simultaneously rejects their thesis that “to perceive, read, understand, or behave at all intelligently [...] must always be to interpret” and seeks to refute it with many original arguments. He also insists that the notion of interpretation needs a contrasting category to guarantee its own meaningfulness. If everything is interpretation then the concept loses its point. Shusterman argues that immediate, non-interpretive understanding can serve that role of contrast. Inspired by Wittgenstein and Heidegger's theory of [[hermeneutics|hermeneutic circle]], Shusterman proposes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“the immediacy of uninterrupted understandings of language (as when I immediately understand simple and pertinent utterances of a language I know well) and the mediacy of interpretations (as when I encounter an utterance or text that I do not understand in terms of word-meaning or contextual relevance and then have to figure out what is meant)”.&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, "Pragmatism and Criticism", p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Among Shusterman's achievements in the theory of interpretation, there are also the accounts of literary criticism he created in his earlier, analytic period, as well as his pragmatist arguments against interpretational intentionalism and his genealogical critique of deconstructionist ([[Harold Bloom]]’s, [[Jonathan Culler]]’s), analytic ([[Joseph Margolis]]’) and neo-pragmatist (Richard Rorty's, Stanley Fish's, [[Walter Benn Michaels]] and [[Steven Knapp]]’s) literary theories which, as he claims, are all governed at their core by an ideology of professionalism.

===Popular art===

According to Shusterman, one of the most pressing sociocultural problems of today is the aesthetic legitimization of popular art. He feels that though popular art may now seem to be socially justified, its artistic value is still questioned which leads to the following problems:
*popular art is “deprived of artistic care and control” which could protect it against the negative influence of the market, and, as a result, it often becomes “brutally crude in sensibility”&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, ''Pragmatist Aesthetics'' (2000), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;
*satisfactions provided by this kind of art cannot be complete since they are diminished by a sense of humiliation which is induced in its audience by official art institutions’ explicit disapproval of popular art forms.
*this situation in turn “intensifies painful divisions in society and even in ourselves”.&lt;ref&gt;R.Shusterman, “Popular Art and Education”, ''Studies in Philosophy and Education'', 13, 1995, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;
A sincere advocate of popular aesthetics, Shusterman is careful to distinguish his stance from one-sided apologia and would rather characterize it as ‘melorism’ which “recognizes popular art’s flaws and abuses but also its merits [while also holding] that popular art should be improved because it can and often does achieve real aesthetic merits and serve worthy social ends”.&lt;ref&gt;R.Shusterman, “Popular Art and Education”, p.204.&lt;/ref&gt;
Putting his meliorism into practice, Shusterman seeks to win aesthetic legitimation for popular art in two ways:
*On a general theoretical level:
**he promotes the definition of art as experience, assuming that it could “effect the artistic legitimation” of popular art (e.g., “[[rock music]]”) “which affords such frequent and intensely gratifying aesthetic experience to so many people from so many nations, cultures, and classes”;&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, ''Pragmatist Aesthetics'' (2000), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
**provides counter arguments to the most influential criticisms of popular art (e.g., [[Theodor W. Adorno]]’s and [[Allan Bloom]]’s&lt;ref&gt;See chapter 7 of ''Pragmatist Aesthetics'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;)
**analyzes (both on conceptual-etymological as well as genealogical level) the phenomenon of entertainment to highlight the crucial positive role it plays in human existence.&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, "Entertainment: A Question for Aesthetics", ''British Journal of Aesthetics'', 43, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Shusterman also engages in the aesthetic criticism of particular genres of popular arts and of its concrete works, arguing for artistic value of [[country music]] and [[hip hop music|rap]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Affect and Authenticity In Country Musicals” in ''Performing Live'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2000); “The Fine Art of Rap” in ''Pragmatist Aesthetics'' (2000); “Art in Action, Art Infraction. Goodman, Rap, Pragmatism (New Reality Mix)” in ''Practicing Philosophy: Pragmatism and the Philosophical Life''; "Pragmatism, Art, and Violence: The Case of Rap”, in T. Yamamoto (ed.), ''Philosophical Designs for a Socio-Cultural Transformation'' (Tokyo and Boulder: E.H.E.S.C. and Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; What is worth stressing is that Shusterman was probably the first art philosopher ever to write about rap,&lt;ref&gt;His „Fine Art of Rap” was first published in 1991: ''New Literary History'', 22, 1991, p. 613-632.&lt;/ref&gt; and despite the fact that the accuracy of his treatment of this music genre is sometimes questioned,&lt;ref&gt;See T. Brennan, “Off the Gangsta Tip: A Rap Appreciation, or Forgetting about Los Angeles”, ''Critical Inquiry'', 20, 1994; G. C. Maher, “Brechtian Hip-Hop. Didactics and Self-Production in Post-Gangsta Political Mixtapes”, ''Journal of Black Studies'', vol. 36, no. 1, September, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; his groundbreaking role in this area cannot be denied and has been appreciated worldwide.

===Somaesthetics===
{{main article|Somaesthetics}}

'Somaesthetics’ is a term coined by Shusterman to denote a new philosophical discipline he has invented as a remedy for the following problems:

*According to Shusterman our culture's growing preoccupation with the body has not yet found an appropriate response in the realm of philosophy, which simply neglects the somatic, textualizes it, or reduces it to gender or racial difference, and thus is unwilling or unable to counteract the negative aspects of the current body boom (such as the tendency that “contemporary aesthetic ideals of body remain enslaved by shallow and oppressive stereotypes that serve more to increase profits for the cosmetics industries than to enrich our experience of the varieties of bodily charms”&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and the Revival of Aesthetics”, ''[[Filozofski Vestnik]]'', vol. XXVIII, no. 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;).
*Despite the relative abundance of humanist disciplines devoted to the body they lack
**a conceptual framework that could integrate their efforts (and also allow for their better cooperation with natural sciences and various somatic methods);
**“a clear pragmatic orientation, something that the individual can directly translate into a discipline of improved somatic practice”.&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and the Body/Media Issue” in ''Performing Live'', p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Philosophical aesthetics has paid very little attention to the body as a result of “the willful neglect of the body in [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten’s]] founding text of modern aesthetics, an omission reinforced by subsequent intellectualist and idealist theories (from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] through [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and on to contemporary theories that emphasize disinterested contemplation)”.&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and the Revival of Aesthetics”&lt;/ref&gt;

The above-mentioned conditions have determined the nature of somaesthetics as a grounded-in-philosophical-aesthetics yet interdisciplinary project of theory and practice which can be defined as:

{{Quotation|“the critical, meliorative study of the experience and the use of one’s body as a locus sensory-aesthetic appreciation (aisthesis) and creative self-fashioning [...], devoted [also] to the knowledge, discourses and disciplines that structure such somatic care or can improve it.”.&lt;ref&gt;R.Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and Care of the Self: The Case of Foucault”, ''Monist'', 83, 2000, p. 532-533.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To clarify the terminological issues, one needs to mention that Shusterman has intentionally put the term ‘soma’ (instead of the more familiar ‘body’) in the name of his disciplinary proposal to emphasize one important feature of his conception of corporeality. For Shusterman, who is a true disciple of Dewey in this regard, bodily and mental (as well as cultural and biological) dimensions of  human beings are essentially inseparable, and to signify this unity (this “sentient perceiving «body-mind»”) he prefers to use the term ‘soma’ which, unlike ‘body’, does not automatically connote passive flesh contrasted to dynamic soul or mind.

Although Shusterman's project may at first glance seem utterly innovatory and even iconoclastic, its various elements, as Shusterman himself admits, can be traced to many respected traditions: ancient Greek philosophy and the later Western philosophies (Michel de Montaigne, John Dewey, Michel Foucault), but also East-Asian wisdom such as Confucianism.
Somaesthetics divides into three fundamental branches:

*''analytical somaesthetics'' which is a “descriptive and theoretical enterprise devoted to explaining the nature of our bodily perceptions and practices and their function in our knowledge and construction of the world. Besides the traditional topics in philosophy of mind, ontology, and epistemology that relate to the mind-body issue and the role of somatic factors in consciousness and action, analytic somaesthetics also includes the sort of genealogical, sociological, and cultural analyses advanced by Beauvoir, Foucault [and] Pierre Bourdieu”;&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and The Second Sex: A Pragmatist Reading of a Feminist Classic”, ''Hypatia'' 18, 2003, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''pragmatic somaesthetics'' which (in “contrast to analytic somaesthetics, whose logic is essentially descriptive”) “has a distinctly normative, often prescriptive, character because it involves proposing specific methods of somatic improvement or engaging in their comparison, explanation, and critique”;&lt;ref&gt;''Ibidem'', p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''practical somaesthetics'' which “involves actually engaging in programs of disciplined, reflective, corporeal practice aimed at somatic self-improvement”.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibidem'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shusterman himself works in all three somaesthetic subdisciplines:

*within the analytic field he theorizes the body's status as the basic medium of human existence and the fundamental role it plays in the realm of cognition, ethics, politics and aesthetics;&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and the Body/Media Issue”&lt;/ref&gt;
*in pragmatic somaesthetics
**he analyzes different somatic disciplines (e.g., Feldenkrais method, [[Alexander Technique]], [[Bioenergetics]]);&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “The Somatic Turn: Care of the Body in Contemporary Culture”, chapter 8 of ''Performing Live''.&lt;/ref&gt;
**criticizes different thinkers, such as [[Edmund Burke]], [[William James]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and Michel Foucault, for either neglecting or misconceiving the value of various forms of somatic care;&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., R. Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and Burke’s Sublime”, ''British Journal of Aesthetics'', 45, 2005;“William James, Somatic Introspection, and Care of the Self”, ''Philosophical Forum'', 36, 2005; "The Silent, Limping Body of Philosophy”, in T. Carman and M. Hansen (eds.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Merleau-Ponty'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
**scrutinizes the issue of Asian erotic arts;&lt;ref&gt;“Asian Ars Erotica and the Question of Sexual Aesthetics”,''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', vol. 65, no. 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
**discusses the value of somaesthetics for education in the humanities;&lt;ref&gt;R.Shusterman,“Somaesthetics and Education: Exploring the Terrain”, in Liora Bressler (ed.), ''Knowing Bodies, Moving Minds: Towards Embodied Teaching and Learning'' (Dordrecht: Kluwer, 2004); “Thinking Through the Body: Educating for the Humanities”, ''Journal of Aesthetic Education'', vol. 40, no. 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*As a certified practitioner of the Feldenkrais Method and a somatic therapist, he gives workshops on somaesthetics that include practical exercises and demonstrations, and he also has experience in treating different cases of somatic disabilities.

While undeniably a new phenomenon, somaesthetics, which by now forms the center of Shusterman's philosophical inquiries, has already influenced many scholars working in fields as diverse as philosophy, [[art education]], [[dance theory]], health and fitness studies.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the secondary literature listed above&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Static trapeze''', also known as '''fixed trapeze''', is a type of circus art performed on the [[trapeze]].  In contrast to the other forms of [[trapeze]], on static trapeze the bars and ropes mainly stay in place.

Most often, the static trapeze is about 1.5 feet wide and the bar is generally 2 inches in diameter.  The ropes are at least two human lengths, as many figures are performed on the ropes above the bar.  The ropes can be made of many materials, including cotton or hemp, and often have a wire woven inside.
It can be performed by a single artist or two partners working together. A single artist will do tricks above and below the bar, the ropes playing just as important a part as the bar. A partner act will involve the partners working together — supporting each other's weight, throwing, lifting and catching each other. 

Self-standing trapezes can be purchased for home use.

'''Multiple trapeze''' is an act entailing the use of more than one [[trapeze]], typically two or three. In these acts, multiple people perform simultaneously.
The most common type of multiple trapeze is a "triple trapeze". A triple trapeze has one long bar, held up by a ropes, basically three trapezes put together, with the middle trapeze sharing the ropes of the other two. Multiple trapeze can also refer to an abstract structure with trapeze like structures, inside which multiple artists may perform.

An experimental cage-like structure was created by  [[Cirque du Soleil]] for their show [[Varekai]], but was ultimately scrapped in production. However, the structure did appear in the 'Making of' documentary, 'Fire Within.'

A '''triple trapeze''' is a type of static (still) [[trapeze]] with three trapezes on one bar. Therefore, there are four ropes connecting this trapeze to its frame, or whatever it is hanging from. Performers specialize in synchronized tricks. One example of a triple trapeze act can be seen in [[Cirque du Soleil]]'s show [[Varekai]].

'''''Synthesia''''' is a piano keyboard trainer for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] which allows users to play a [[MIDI keyboard]] or use a [[Keyboard (computing)|computer keyboard]] in time to a [[MIDI file]] by following on-screen directions, much in the style of ''[[Keyboard Mania]]'' or ''[[Guitar Hero]]''. Additionally, Synthesia can be paired with MIDI keyboards that have illuminated keys, or with [[virtual piano|virtual]] [[player piano]] on screen, which some people believe makes learning piano easier for beginners. It was originally named '''''Piano Hero''''', due to the similarity of gameplay with ''[[Guitar Hero]]''; this was until [[Activision]] (the owners of the rights to ''Guitar Hero'') sent a [[cease and desist]] to the program's creator, Nicholas Piegdon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.destructoid.com/activision-sends-piano-hero-fella-cease-and-decist-denies-plans-of-lawyer-hero-30825.phtml | work=Destructoid | accessdate=2008-01-10 | title=Activision sends Piano Hero fella cease and decist; denies plans of Lawyer Hero}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.synthesiagame.com/cease.aspx | work=Synthesia Official Website | accessdate=2012-01-04 | title='Piano Hero' Name Cease And Desist From Activision}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
'''Synthesia''' was started around 2006 by American developer Nicholas Piegdon, and was originally named "Piano Hero". Hosted as an [[open-source software|open-source]] project on [[sourceforge]], it was released under [[MIT license]].

The program was originally [[Windows]]-only, but after a donation-drive in early 2007, the game was ported to [[Mac OS X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tuaw.com/2007/02/12/you-want-piano-hero-on-your-mac/ | work=TUAW| accessdate=2008-01-10 | title=You want Piano Hero on your Mac?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cease and desist letter===
In a letter dated 26 March 2007 Activision requested that Piegdon ''"immediately cease any and all use of the "Piano Hero" name in connection with the distribution and promotion of [his] video game and agree not to use such in the future"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/piano-hero/piano-hero-gets-cease-and-desist-249940.php | work=Kotaku | accessdate=2008-01-10 | title=Piano Hero Gets Cease and Desist | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709194743/http://kotaku.com/249940/piano-hero-gets-cease-and-desist?tag=gamingpianohero | archivedate=2012-07-09 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Piegdon responded by hosting a contest for a new name for the project, resulting in the name, Synthesia, suggested by Daniel Lawrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.synthesiagame.com/faq.aspx#what_is | work=Synthesia Official Website| accessdate = 2014-08-18 | title=Synthesia Name Change | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071024124344/http://www.synthesiagame.com/faq.aspx#what_is | archivedate = 2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continued development as closed-source project ===
After May 2012 Piegdon decided to stop releasing the [[source code]], as he saw the potential commercial value of the program. However the last open-source release version 0.6.1b is still available for download.

In the continued commercial version the basic functionality was still freeware. 
A "Learning Pack" key could be purchased to unlock the freemium additional features, such as a [[sheet music]] display mode. 
In December 2014, with Version 10 of Synthesia, the ability to use the program without purchasing it was removed, with the exception of several playable included demo MIDIs.

==Features==
Synthesia has support for playing custom MIDI files, as well as linking with MIDI devices. Synthesia will rate the player's performance afterwards, and give a score which can be submitted to an online scoreboard. Synthesia also has a paid "Learning Pack" that allows users to view music in [[Musical notation]], as well as multiple practice features, such as "Melody Practice" which pauses the song whenever the user misses a note, and only continues when the right note is played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.synthesiagame.com/ | work=Synthesia Official Website| accessdate=2012-03-10 | title=Synthesia Features}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Play instrument THATTAI.jpg|thumbnail|Thattai]]

The '''thattai''' is an Indian percussion instrument, belonging to the [[idiophone]] instruments family. It consists in a cane tube, in which the end has three reeds (two of them free) that produce a percussive sound when the shaft is shaken with one hand. Thattai is used as a toy or as rhythmic accompaniment instrument.

'''''The Colossus of Rhodes''''' is a 1954 oil painting by [[Salvador Dalí]]. It is one of a series of seven paintings he created for the 1956 movie [[Seven Wonders of the World (film)|''Seven Wonders of the World'']], each depicting one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], and shows the [[Colossus of Rhodes]], the ancient statue of the Greek titan-god of the sun, [[Helios]]. It was never used for the film, and in 1981 was donated by Georges F. Keller to its present location, the [[Kunstmuseum Bern]].

Dalí's rendering of the Colossus is heavily influenced by a paper, read in 1953 and published in 1956, by [[Herbert Maryon]], a sculptor and [[conservator-restorer|conservator]]
at the [[British Museum]]. Maryon had proposed a hollow Colossus that was made of hammered bronze plates, and stood aside the harbour rather than astride it. He also suggested that it had incorporated a hanging piece of drapery to give the statue a stable tripod base. All of these ideas were used by Dalí, whose depiction looks remarkably similar to Maryon's.

==Background==
''The Colossus of Rhodes'' arose out of Dalí's longstanding fascination with [[Hollywood]].{{sfn|King|2007|pp=59–60}} He described the industry as a surrealist medium, and termed [[Walt Disney]], [[Cecil B. DeMille]] and the [[Marx Brothers]] as "the three great American Surrealists"; in his 1937 essay ''Surrealism in Hollywood'', he declared that "Nothing seems to me more suited to be devoured by the surrealist fire than those mysterious strips of 'hallucinatory celluloid' turned out so unconsciously in Hollywood, and in which we have already seen appear, stupefied, so many images of authentic delirium, chance and dream".{{sfn|King|2007|p=59}} For the 1956 [[Cinerama]] film [[Seven Wonders of the World (film)|''Seven Wonders of the World'']], Dalí was commissioned to create seven paintings: ''The Colossus of Rhodes'',{{sfn|Catalogue Raisonné 689}} ''The Pyramids'',{{sfn|Catalogue Raisonné 693}}{{refn|group=note|The [[Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation]] catalogue raisonné lists ''The Pyramids'' as a 1957 work.{{sfn|Catalogue Raisonné 693}}}} ''The Statue of Olympian Zeus'',{{sfn|Catalogue Raisonné 695}} ''The Temple of Diana at Ephesus'',{{sfn|Catalogue Raisonné 1149}} ''The Walls of Babylon'',{{sfn|Catalogue Raisonné 692}} and two versions of the same wonder, ''The Lighthouse of Alexandria''{{sfn|Catalogue Raisonné 690}} and ''Lighthouse of Alexandria''.{{sfn|Catalogue Raisonné 691}}{{sfn|Christie's|2016}}{{sfn|Sotheby's|2014}} In 1955 he also executed a similar copy, ''Walls of Babylon'',{{sfn|Catalogue Raisonné 1148}} and painted the last wonder, with ''The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus''.{{sfn|Christie's|2016}}{{refn|group=note|The Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation catalogue raisonné does not list ''The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus''. On 13 May 2016 it sold for $1,325,000 at [[Christie's]], which led off its description by asserting that "Nicolas and the late Robert Descharnes have confirmed the authenticity of this work."{{sfn|Christie's|2016}}}} The paintings for the film were made, yet went unused.{{sfn|King|2007|p=60}}

Dalí's rendering of the Colossus is heavily influenced by a 1953 paper by [[Herbert Maryon]],{{sfn|de Callataÿ|2006|pp=53–54}} a sculptor and [[British Museum]] [[conservator-restorer|conservator]] particularly known for his reconstruction of the [[Sutton Hoo helmet]].{{sfn|Easby, Jr.|1966}}{{sfn|Maryon|1947}} On 3 December 1953 he presented a paper to the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], also entitled ''The Colossus of Rhodes''.{{sfn|Maryon|1956|pp=72–75, 79–81}}{{sfn|de Callataÿ|2006|p=54}} It suggested that the statue was hollow, and stood aside the harbour rather than astride it.{{sfn|Maryon|1956|pp=72–75, 79–81}}{{sfn|de Callataÿ|2006|p=54}} Made of hammered bronze plates less than {{convert|1/16|in|adj=on}} thick, Maryon said, the Colossus would have been supported on its base by a hanging piece of drapery acting as a third point of support.{{sfn|Maryon|1956|pp=72–75}}{{sfn|de Callataÿ|2006|p=54}} Although the paper was not published until 1956,{{sfn|Maryon|1956}} two years after Dalí created his painting, [[Herbert Maryon#Colossus articles|newspaper articles about Maryon's 1953 presentation]] proliferated quickly and internationally.{{sfn|de Callataÿ|2006|p=54}}{{sfn|Badoud|2012|pp=34–36, 36 n.129}} In this context the painting "does not look extremely original."{{sfn|de Callataÿ|2006|p=54}} Dalí copied the likeness of the Colossus put forth by Maryon, clearly depicting hammered plates of bronze, and showing the same tripod structure with the statue supported by a piece of drapery.{{sfn|de Callataÿ|2006|p=54}}

==Description==
The painting is named after its subject, the [[Colossus of Rhodes]], a statue of the Greek titan-god of the sun [[Helios]] that was erected in the city of [[Rhodes]] by [[Chares of Lindos]] in 280 BC. The perspective is from below the statue's base, suggesting that the location of the viewer is set in a boat approaching the city, and emphasising the statue's massive size and height.{{sfn|Shanes|2012|pp=224–225}} A piece of drapery hangs around the waist of Helios and from his left arm, falling down to touch the ground behind him.{{sfn|de Callataÿ|2006|p=54}} The statue appears to be made of bronze, and had a segmented construction entirely composed of numerous individual plates.{{sfn|de Callataÿ|2006|p=54}}{{sfn|Badoud|2012|pp=34–36}} Helios raises his right hand to shield his eyes from the sun that he is the god of, giving "a vaguely Surrealist touch" to Dalí's work.{{sfn|Shanes|2012|pp=224–225}} In the lower right is signed "Salvador Dalí / 1954".{{sfn|Catalogue Raisonné 689}}

==Themes==
Dalí's greatest connection with surrealism came before 1940, when his works explored the subconscious and his perception of the world.{{sfn|Shanes|2012|pp=47–48}} ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', one of the works with which he is most identified, came in 1931,{{sfn|Shanes|2012|pp=35–36}} representing a decade that saw Dalí firmly within the avant-garde.{{sfn|Shanes|2012|pp=53, 57}} A move to the United States in 1940 brought new financial pressures, heightening his already marked showmanship and helping to occasion his relationship with Hollywood, and the end of [[World War II]] introduced a focus on the historical, scientific, and religious, to Dalí's work.{{sfn|Shanes|2012|pp=48–53}}

''The Colossus of Rhodes'' exemplifies Dalí's focus on cinema and the historical and scientific, and the loosening of his grip on surrealism.{{sfn|Shanes|2012|pp=224–225}} It is only marginally surrealist—the god of the sun shields himself from his domain—and resembles a movie poster,{{sfn|Shanes|2012|pp=224–225}} befitting a work commissioned for a movie.{{sfn|Christie's|2016}} Nor does Dalí offer a particularly original take on the Colossus, which is heavily influenced by Maryon's suggestions.{{sfn|de Callataÿ|2006|p=54}}

==Provenance==
The painting is in the collection of the [[Kunstmuseum Bern]], where it forms part of the 1981 Georges F. Keller bequest.{{sfn|Catalogue Raisonné 689}} Its accession number is G 82.007.{{sfn|Badoud|2012|p=37}} In the 1980s and 1990s it was exhibited in Europe and North America:{{sfn|Catalogue Raisonné 689}} at the [[Museo de Arte Moderno (Madrid)|Museo de Arte Moderno]] in [[Madrid]] during 1983, at the [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]] in [[Stuttgart]] during 1989, at the [[Louisiana Museum of Modern Art]] in [[Fredensborg Municipality|Humlebaek]] from 1989 to 1990, and later that year in [[Montréal]], at the [[Musée des beaux-arts de Montréal|Musée des Beaux-Arts]].{{sfn|Catalogue Raisonné 689}}

'''''The Ethics of Immigration''''' is a September 2013 book by the philosopher [[Joseph Carens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Ethics of Immigration (Oxford Political Theory)|date = September 19, 2013|last = Carens|first = Joseph|publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]|isbn = 0199933839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of the book==

The first eight chapters of the book argue for a robust system of migrant rights and equal treatment of migrants and natives, while conceding the legitimacy of nation-states and their discretionary control over migration. The ninth and tenth chapter discuss illegal immigrants, family reunification, and refugees. The eleventh chapter argues for [[open border]]s, and challenges the presumption of discretionary control over migration, while still staying within the framework of legitimacy of nation-states.&lt;ref name=bertram/&gt;

==Reception==

===Interviews and self-promotion===

[[Dylan Matthews]] interviewed Carens on his book for the ''Wonkblog'' section of the ''[[Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/11/29/what-gives-us-a-right-to-deport-people-joseph-carens-on-the-ethics-of-immigration/|title = What gives us a right to deport people?

===Book reviews===
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}
In April 2014, ''[[Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews]]'' published a review of the book by Arash Abizadeh of [[McGill University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/47933-the-ethics-of-immigration/|title = The Ethics of Immigration|last = Carens|first = Joseph H.|authorlink = Joseph Carens|date = April 24, 2014|accessdate = May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late May 2014, the [[Crooked Timber]] blog hosted a symposium on the book, with contributions from Chris Bertram,&lt;ref name=bertram&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crookedtimber.org/2014/05/26/book-symposium-on-joseph-carenss-the-ethics-of-immigration/|title = Book Symposium on Joseph Carens’s The Ethics of Immigration|date = May 26, 2014|accessdate = May 28, 2014|last = Bertram|first = Chris|authorlink = Chris Bertram|publisher = [[Crooked Timber]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenan Malik]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crookedtimber.org/2014/05/28/the-ethics-of-immigration-symposium-communities-social-anxiety-and-open-borders/|title = The Ethics of Immigration symposium: Communities, social anxiety and open borders|last = Malik|first = Kenan|authorlink = Kenan Malik|date = May 28, 2014|accessdate = May 28, 2014|publisher = [[Crooked Timber]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan Pevnick,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crookedtimber.org/2014/05/27/the-ethics-of-immigration-symposium-the-theory-of-social-membership/|title = The Ethics of Immigration Symposium: The Theory of Social Membership|last = Pevnick|first = Ryan|date = May 27, 2014|accessdate = May 28, 2014|publisher = [[Crooked Timber]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip Cole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crookedtimber.org/2014/06/02/the-ethics-of-immigration-symposium-on-method/|title = The Ethics of Immigration symposium: On Method|last = Cole|first = Phillip|date = June 2, 2014|accessdate = June 12, 2014|publisher = [[Crooked Timber]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speranta Dumitru,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crookedtimber.org/2014/06/02/the-ethics-of-immigration-symposium-is-carens-still-advocating-open-borders/|title = The Ethics of Immigration symposium: Is Carens still advocating open borders?|last = Dumitru|first = Speranta|date = June 2, 2014|accessdate = June 12, 2014|publisher = [[Crooked Timber]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Fine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crookedtimber.org/2014/06/02/the-ethics-of-immigration-symposium-the-argument-from-democratic-principles/|title = The Ethics of Immigration symposium: The argument from democratic principles|last = Fine|first = Sarah|date = June 2, 2014|accessdate = June 12, 2014|publisher = [[Crooked Timber]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jo Shaw,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crookedtimber.org/2014/06/03/the-ethics-of-immigration-symposium-so-what-does-the-ethics-of-immigration-tell-us-about-the-european-union/|title = The Ethics of Immigration symposium: So what does The Ethics of Immigration tell us about the European Union?|last = Shaw|first = Jo|date = June 3, 2014|accessdate = June 12, 2014|publisher = [[Crooked Timber]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Weatherson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crookedtimber.org/2014/05/28/the-ethics-of-immigration-symposium-movement-within-and-between-states/|title = The Ethics of Immigration Symposium: Movement within and between states|author = Brian|date = May 28, 2014|accessdate = May 28, 2014|publisher = [[Crooked Timber]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

The figurine was discovered in 1930, near the [[Sudost River]] in the province of Briansk in Russia. It is 15 cm high and was carved from mammoth ivory. Remarkably, the figurine depicts a young woman, just like the [[Venus impudique]].&lt;ref&gt;Henri Delporte: ''L’image de la femme dans l’art préhistorique'', Ed. Picard 1979, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roman mosaics from Vetusta monumenta (Vol.1, 1826).jpg|thumb|Roman [[mosaic]]s from [[Wellow, Somerset]] near [[Bath, England]], double page spread in volume 1, in an 1826 reprint]]
'''''Vetusta Monumenta''''' is the title of a published series of illustrated [[antiquary|antiquarian]] papers on ancient buildings, sites, and artefacts, mostly those of Britain, published at irregular intervals between 1718 and 1906 by the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]]. The [[Folio (printing)|folio]] sized papers, usually written by members of the society, were first published individually, and then later in collected volumes.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/makinghistory/recording-and-illustrating,444,AR.html|title=: Antiquaries in Britain, 1707–2007 -  Recording and illustrating|last=Harris|first=Greg|work=Making History|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
The full title is ''Vetusta monumenta quae ad Rerum Britanicarum memoriam conservandam Societas Antiquariorum Londini sumptu suo edenda curavit'', but the volumes are normally simply cited as ''Vetusta Monumenta''. There were various reprints of both individual papers and collected volumes, and the plates were often published separately from the text. According to the HOLLIS database at [[Harvard]]: "The seven volumes are dated 1747, 1789, 1796, 1815, 1835, 1883 and 1906 (for the fourth part of vol.7). The plates for vol. 1 were published between 1718 and 1747; plates for vol. 2 were published between 1748 and 1789; plates for vol. 3 were published between 1790 and 1796; plates for vol. 4 were published between 1799 and 1815; plates for vol. 5 were published between 1816 and 1835; plates for vol. 6 were published between 1821 and 1885; plates for the four parts of vol. 7 were published between 1893 and 1906."&lt;ref&gt;[http://eresearch.lib.harvard.edu/V/T9H1EJI2QMR5XA1E97JX3K8YYF9GRUU5N3ISA1YINE3AHKKV3T-77390?func=quick-1 HOLLIS database at Harvard] (dynamic link - enter title)&lt;/ref&gt;

The series began the same year that the society formalized its existence with the first minuted meeting on January 1, 1718, at the Mitre Tavern, [[Fleet Street]]; the society's main journal ''[[Archaeologia_(London)#Publications|Archaeologia]]'' did not begin publication until 1770.  Members of the society received a free copy as each part was published.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, [http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/makinghistory/founding-the-society-of-antiquaries,449,AR.html ''Founding the Society of Antiquaries''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306034954/http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/makinghistory/founding-the-society-of-antiquaries,449,AR.html |date=March 6, 2012 }} and ''Recording and illustrating'', as above.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The emphasis was on the large and detailed illustrations, initially  high quality [[engravings]], which conveyed information on the subject matter in an accessible and economical way.&lt;ref name="Nurse"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover 1520|last=Nurse |first=Bernard (Librarian, RSA)|work=alecto historical editions|accessdate=23 November 2010|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each issue was usually developed from papers and research of the society, giving a text description accompanied by illustrated details it had commissioned. The assemblage of maps, site plans, and other detail was a novelty that found popular appeal.

The views in the series contained images of people and other means of conveying scale, providing the perspective of the interested visitor. These accompanied text descriptions for the sites, but provided additional information with high levels of detail and multiple or idealised viewpoints to simulate a well informed tour. Many of the plates show the setting, inset with exploded views, cross sections and other architectural details, or objects found at the site. Other figures were interspersed with the text, or taking up several full pages. Critics have compared this approach with contemporaneous works that included the subject as an attractively sketched scene, illustrations were not yet recognised as a valuable source of information. The book used the multiple and separate details to synthesise encyclopaedic surveys that typified the approach of the natural historians and antiquaries, what [[Barbara Maria Stafford]] has described as "cross-referencing material bits of distant reality".&lt;ref name="Arnold1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=Dana|title=The metropolis and its image: constructing identities for London, c. 1750-1950|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ke4X4HjHTi8C&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=23 November 2010|year=1999|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-21667-4|pages=14–16|chapter=Atheticizing the Ancestral City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1803 article on the [[Rosetta Stone]] was amongst the earliest published research.&lt;ref&gt;1803: "Has tabulas inscriptionem ... ad formam et modulum exemplaris inter spolia ex bello Aegyptiaco nuper reportati et in Museo Britannico asservati suo sumptu incidendas curavit Soc. Antiquar. Londin. A.D. MDCCCIII" in Vetusta Monumenta vol. 4 plates 5–7&lt;/ref&gt;  The first detailed account of the medieval French [[Royal Gold Cup]] in the [[British Museum]] was published in one of the last papers, of 1904, by Sir [[Charles Hercules Read]].&lt;ref&gt;Read, Sir Charles Hercules. ''The Royal Gold Cup of the Kings of France and England, now preserved in the British Museum''. ''Vetusta Monumenta'' Volume 7, part 3, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;

Notices on illustrations mention the following engravers:
* [[George Vertue]], engraver to the society. Produced a drawing of the [[Holbein Gate]] in 1724, his 1727 engraving appears in volume 1, 1747.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=67926 The Holbein Gate and the Tiltyard Gallery]', Survey of London: volume 14: St Margaret, Westminster, part III: Whitehall II (1931), pp. 10-22. Date accessed: 24 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Other works include the portrait of Richard II at Westminster, the shrine of Edward the Confessor, and a view of [[Waltham Cross]]; nearly all the copperplate to 1756 was engraved by Vertue.&lt;ref name=DNB1&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Vertue, George|last=O'Donoghue|first=Freeman Marius|authorlink=Freeman Marius O'Donoghue}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[James Basire]] (1730–1802), one of Vertue's successors, who produced large and exquisite design on copperplate. His descendants of the same name, the son James Basire (1769–1822) and grandson (1796–1869), were also appointed engraver of the Society. His work for the volumes—after his appointment in the 1760s—is described as amongst his best,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|title=Basire, James, et al.}} citing Redgrave, ''Dict''.&lt;/ref&gt; however,
