'''''17 Miracles''''' is a 2011 film directed by [[T. C. Christensen]]. It was released in 2011 by [[Excel Entertainment Group]]. Based on the experiences of members of the Willie Handcart Company of [[Mormon pioneers]] following their late-season start and subsequent winter journey to [[Salt Lake City]] in 1856, the film emphasizes miracles individual participants reported having during the journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://lds.org/church/news/lds-filmmaker-brings-stories-of-early-saints-to-life?lang=eng |title= Church News: LDS Filmmaker Brings Stories of Early Saints to Life |work= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church |date= 2011-07-21 |accessdate= 2011-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in select theaters across the United States in the summer of 2011.
==Plot==
When [[Levi Savage]], a former [[Mormon Battalion]] member and missionary to Asia, agrees to assist the Willie Handcart Company as they journey to [[Salt Lake City]] in 1856, the late start and onset of a bitter winter leaves the pioneers unprepared and suffering as they cross the plains of the Midwestern United States. Elizabeth Panting, a woman who has converted to the LDS Church, escapes her drunken husband with her two little children, joining the handcart company. With the threat of winter starvation, illness, wolves, freezing river crossings, and death following them throughout their journey, Levi and others also witness the occurrences of divine miracles that enable them to complete their journey and arrive in Salt Lake City.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1909270/synopsis |title= Synopsis for 17 Miracles |publisher= [[IMDb]] |accessdate= 2011-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Written and directed by T. C. Christensen (''[[The Work and the Glory (film)|The Work and the Glory]]'', ''[[The Testaments]]'', ''Only a Stonecutter''), and produced by Ron Tanner and Christensen, ''17 Miracles'' debuted on June 2, 2011, in select theaters in [[Utah]], and then across the [[United States]]. The film was subsequently released on DVD and [[Blu-ray]] for distribution by [[Excel Entertainment Group]] through [[Deseret Book]] and affiliated retailers.

==Reception==
Critic Sean P. Means of ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'' gave the film a mixed review. He thought that Christensen's eye for striking cinematography gave the film a "glossy look"  and Wade's portrayal of the hardy Levi Savage "held the film together." However, Means suggested that the film's structure as a series of vignettes was "wearying" and some of the low-budget effects were "distracting."&lt;Ref&gt;http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment/51900407-81/miracles-movie-faithful-102.html.cspM&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4642">The '''Abel Fosdyk papers''' (or "Abel Fosdyk's Story") is an [[apocrypha#Metaphorical usage|apocryphal]] explanation of the fate of the ''[[Mary Celeste]]'' which was presented on its original publication in 1913 as true but which is most likely a [[literary hoax]].

==Publication==
In 1913, the highly successful monthly fiction magazine the ''[[Strand Magazine]]'' invited its contributors and readers to suggest possible solutions to the mystery of the ''Mary Celeste''. Among the many responses was an account from an apparently impeccable source which claimed to be true. A letter from Mr. A. Howard Linford [[Master of Arts|MA]], of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], the headmaster of Peterborough Lodge, [[Hampstead]]'s largest [[Preparatory school (UK)|prep school]],&lt;ref name=begg&gt;{{cite book | last = Begg | first = Paul | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Mary Celeste: The Greatest Mystery of the Sea | publisher = Pearson Education | year = 2006 | location = | pages = 88–89 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4058-3621-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed to have found an account of the ''Mary Celeste'' among papers given to him by an old servant, Abel Fosdyk, on his deathbed. In addition to Fosdyk's supposed manuscript, Linford included as support a photograph of a little girl plus some drawings made by Linford's son. The account appeared in the November 1913 edition of ''The Strand Magazine'' under the title "Abel Fosdyk's Story".&lt;ref name=begg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Linford | first = A. Howard | authorlink = | last2 = | first2 = | authorlink2 = | title = Abel Fosdyk's Story | newspaper = [[Strand Magazine]]|volume = 46 | pages = 46 | date = November 1913 | url = | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fosdyk's account==
Fosdyk's papers say that he had to leave the [[United States]] quickly due to some misfortunes, and being a friend to [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] [[Benjamin Briggs]], he convinced the captain to allow him on board. While at sea, Captain Briggs had a carpenter build a high special deck on the [[quarterdeck]] for his young daughter and wife, that would allow them a better view while at sea.

According to Fosdyk's account, which is set down in the manner of a [[diary]], one day Captain Briggs engaged in a lighthearted dispute with the [[chief mate|mate]] about how well a man could swim with his clothes on. Captain Briggs and the mate then exchange clothes and jump overboard, and began swimming around the vessel. Captain Briggs' wife and child, Fosdyk, and some other members of the crew stepped up onto the specially built deck for a better view of the fun.

Suddenly, one swimming crew member screamed in agony. Looking around, they saw that he was being attacked by a shark, and he quickly disappeared under the water. The remaining members of the crew also ran up onto the specially built deck to better see what was happening, and it promptly collapsed, tossing them all into the sea and leaving no one on board the ''Mary Celeste''.

What followed, by Fosdyk's account, was a splashing confusion, with sharks attacking all those in the water, with the exception of Fosdyk, who by accident had landed on top of the shattered piece of deck. The ''Mary Celeste'' floated away from their location and by the time the shark attack was over, Fosdyk was the only survivor, and he was unable to reach the ship. He floated for several days, thirsting for water and suffering from exposure, finally washing ashore on the coast of [[Africa]]. Fearful of retribution due to the outlandish details of his story, he never revealed the incident to anyone. It only came to light after his death because Linford went public with it.

==Debunking==
* While Fosdyk claims to have been one of the ''Mary Celeste'''s company, none of the names in his account appear on the official records.
* Fosdyk says that the ''Mary Celeste'' was a ship of 600 tons, when in fact it was less than a third of that.
* His writings also says that the crew were [[English people|English]], when in fact they were mostly [[German people|German]] and [[United States|American]], a detail that would most likely not have been overlooked, as he would have had a daily interaction with the entire crew, of which there were only seven.
* His story fails to explain the missing boat, papers and navigation instruments.
* There was no evidence that a special deck was ever built or that it collapsed.

'''''Angry Video Game Nerd''''' (abbreviated as '''''AVGN''''', and originally known as '''''Bad NES Games''''' and '''''Angry Nintendo Nerd''''') is an American adult comedy [[retrogaming]] [[web television|web series]], created by and starring [[James Rolfe]]. The series centers on Rolfe's character "The Nerd", a short-tempered and foul-mouthed [[Gamer|video game fanatic]] who delivers commentary on retro games he considers to be of poor quality. While the series began with Rolfe simply playing games while delivering a running commentary, the show would eventually grow in scope to encompass sketches featuring guest characters, reviews of gaming consoles and peripherals, and short lectures about video game history and culture.&lt;ref name="Faqs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinemassacre.com/faq/ |title=Cinemassacre In General: Faqs and Interviews |first=James |last=Rolfe |date=|work=[[Cinemassacre]] |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting out as an independent filmmaker, Rolfe intended for his earliest videos of the Nerd character to be a joke privately shown to his friends.&lt;ref name="nerdfaq" /&gt; In 2004, with collaboration from his friend Mike Matei, Rolfe put the ''Angry Nintendo Nerd'' videos on his website, Cinemassacre.com. In 2006, Matei persuaded Rolfe to put his work on [[YouTube]], where it gained in popularity. In 2007, the series became a program on [[ScrewAttack]] and [[GameTrailers]], where it was renamed ''The Angry Video Game Nerd'' to avoid trademark issues with [[Nintendo]], and to allow Rolfe to review games from non-Nintendo consoles.&lt;ref name="Faqs"/&gt; From there, the series became a cult success, and Rolfe began appearing as the character in various other media such as a feature-length film and video games, and many public appearances.

Angry Video Game Nerd is considered one of the pioneers of internet review videos, being highly influential on the style and format of subsequent video reviewers as well as being responsible for helping to bring the concept into the mainstream.&lt;ref name="Michigan"/&gt;

{{main|List of Angry Video Game Nerd episodes}}
[[File:James D. Rolfe.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[James Rolfe]] in-character as the Nerd in 2008.]]
The show revolves around the Nerd's commentary of retro video games which he deems to be of particularly low quality, unfair difficulty, or poor design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmediany.com/details_news_article.php?news_artid=749 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305033255/http://allmediany.com/details_news_article.php?news_artid=749 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 5, 2011 |title=Top 20 Angry Video Game Nerd Freak Outs |first=David |last=Guzman |date=March 3, 2011 |work=AllMediaNY.com |accessdate=March 10, 2011 |quote=Ever since James Rolfe – the filmmaker who brought the Nerd to life – started posting tirades about awfully ancient video games on [[YouTube]] in 2006, the following he’s gotten there has become pretty big. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolfe's character, "the Nerd", is a short-tempered and foul-mouthed video game fanatic who satirically reviews old video games in the form reminiscent of insult comedies such as ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.&lt;ref name="Media"/&gt; The Nerd plays the game while talking about its various problems, technicalities and imperfections, mixed with [[profanity]],&lt;ref name="Love"&gt;Enevold , Jessica et. al. ''Game Love: Essays on Play and Affection''. McFarland (January 14, 2015). pp. 261–262. {{ISBN|978-0786496938}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to warn people against playing the game, and sometimes with a short lecture about the gaming era's history.&lt;ref name="NY"/&gt;

Dressed up as a stereotypical [[nerd]] in his basement, the Nerd reviews the game with his trademark eyeglasses and white collared shirt with a pocket full of pens, high khaki pants and white socks and loafers, while sometimes being bombarded by guest characters from video games and popular culture as well. These guests often provide additional commentary on the games, mock the Nerd's anguish, and act as [[Parody|parodies]] of the characters from which they had been derived. In response to them and to the games, the Nerd derives comic appeal from excessive and surrealistic use of fantasy scenarios, anger, and consumption of [[Rolling Rock]] (in addition to [[Yuengling]] in later videos) while reviewing video games.&lt;ref name="Media"/&gt; His anger and profanity over these bad games would sometimes climax in him destroying whole game cartridges, or simulating defecating on, burning, and sometimes even crushing entire video game consoles.&lt;ref name="Media"/&gt;

In many cases, the Nerd dresses up as other popular characters while reviewing their games, such as [[Batman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cinemassacre|title=Batman – Angry Video Game Nerd – Episode 52|date=2010-01-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFvtk5toGJg|accessdate=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Indiana Jones. Other characters in the show include Shit Pickle (an earlier character created by Rolfe), Guitar Guy (played by Kyle Justin, co-worker of the show's theme song), the Game Glitch Gremlin, Super Mecha Death Christ 2000 B.C. Version 4.0 Beta, and an assortment of others, while also the occasional guest appearance by other video game reviewers such as Pat the NES Punk.&lt;ref name="Faqs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/6-angry-video-game-nerd-episodes/|title=The 6 Best Angry Video Game Nerd Episodes|publisher=''MUO Gaming''|first=Dave|last=LeClair|accessdate=May 15, 2015}} December 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
James Rolfe's first videos were intended as "just a joke", with no intentions of making them public, showing them only to his friends.&lt;ref name="nerdfaq" /&gt; In May 2004, Rolfe created his first on-camera game reviews just for fun; utilizing insult commentary with exaggerated bewilderment  to two games; ''[[Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest]]'' and ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (video game)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' under the title of "Bad [[NES]] Games", which would later become the signature of the Nerd character.&lt;ref name="NY"/&gt; Rolfe explained later in an interview for ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' that the joke was just how upset one obsessive gamer could get over these games that were already 20 years old.&lt;ref name="NY"/&gt; Although the ''Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' review was intended to be the last, Rolfe's friends, who enjoyed the previous “Bad NES Games” reviews, encouraged him to create another. Collaborative friend Mike Matei helped in producing and publishing the videos on Cinemassacre,&lt;ref name="nerdfaq"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The CineMassacre Productions |url=http://www.cinemassacre.com/faq/ |title=Cinemassacre FAQ |year=2010 |accessdate=June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released outside of the website as "The Quickies" tape, part of a four VHS tape set called the "Cinemassacre Gold Collection".&lt;ref name=dvddocumentary&gt;{{cite video |people=James Rolfe |title=What Was I Thinking?: The Making of the Angry Video Game Nerd |medium=DVD |publisher=ScrewAttack |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Rolfe began making the episodes available on YouTube. Soon, Rolfe released a review of ''[[The Karate Kid (video game)|The Karate Kid]]'' game which was the first episode where Rolfe's character is introduced as “The Angry Nintendo Nerd”.&lt;ref name="Media"/&gt; Naming these videos “The Angry Nintendo Nerd Trilogy”, Rolfe posted them on Cinemassacre. The  success of the show made Rolfe branch out into other gaming systems, and would later change the title into the ''Angry Video Game Nerd'' to prevent trademark issues with Nintendo.&lt;ref name="nerdfaq" /&gt; Rolfe diversified the reviews of platforms and products such as the [[Atari 2600]], [[Super NES]], [[Sega Master System]] and [[Sega Genesis]] [[video game console]]s, the [[Power Glove]] and [[U-Force]] peripherals, films such as ''[[The Wizard (1989 film)|The Wizard]]'', and the ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Faqs"/&gt; He also reviewed [[Sonic the Hedgehog (2006 video game)|Sonic '06]] on Xbox 360 and [[Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing]] on PC.

On September 12, 2006, Rolfe's series received mainstream attention when his review of ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (NES game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' went viral on YouTube.&lt;ref name="MTV"/&gt; In an article by writer Alex Carlson, he explained that before 2004, video gaming criticism was mostly reserved for the larger game magazines and websites. These already established names were made up mostly of professional writers and journalists that were seldom challenged, and doesn't entirely correspond to the opinions of the average gamers.&lt;ref name="Alex"/&gt; Video portals and online videos were at its infancy. Carlson stated that the Nerd popularized independent [[Viral video|viral video reviews]] made from the perspective of an average gamer. It was a purely independent in nature, from the simple and old-school cinematography right down to the camcorder-based video editing. He stated that afterwards, "everyone with a webcam and Fraps can now become a critic and don a characterized mentality, spouting profanities at will without getting censored."&lt;ref name="Alex"/&gt; Since then, the show has increased substantially in quantity, production value, and [[fandom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weprin |first=Alex |date=June 2, 2008 |title=Spike TV Revamps Web Presence |journal=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |volume=138 |issue=14–25 |page=28 |publisher=Cahners Publishing |accessdate=March 10, 2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ficQAQAAMAAJ |quote=The new Spike.com features a high-resolution full-episode video with the ability to embed episodes of Spike programming on outside sites, social-networking features and exclusive original content from YouTube stars such as "the Angry Video Game Nerd" and established entertainment brands such as Playboy Enterprises and Ultimate Fighting Championship.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rolfe began infusing various episodes with emphasis on homemade special effects and narratives. The first of these cinematic episodes was a review of the 1989 ''[[Friday the 13th (1989 video game)|Friday the 13th]]'' game in October 2006, featuring expressive lighting and camera angles to emphasize its horror film-themed narrative in which the Nerd is attacked by [[Jason Voorhees]] for disliking the game.&lt;ref name="Media"/&gt; Later episodes have alternated from straightforward game reviews to those with a narrative focus resembling a [[documentary]], with Rolfe pointing out information about the game or gaming console under review. When asked if the Nerd is going to make reviews in the current generation of video games, Rolfe replied that the “show is all about nostalgia,” adding that he's “mostly a [[retro]] gamer."&lt;ref name="Media"/&gt;

In late 2007, Rolfe halted the production of the series after suffering from a break in his voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cinemassare News Archive: 11/21/2007-2/18/2008 |url=http://www.cinemassacre.com/Home_page/frameset.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319075502/http://www.cinemassacre.com/Home_page/frameset.html |archivedate=March 19, 2008 |publisher=Cinemassacre}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 17, 2010, he publicly announced that he was suffering from [[burnout (psychology)|burnout]] as a result of stress from his constant work, and that the show would be entering a brief hiatus. The show was resumed a month later; however, only one episode is released each month, as opposed to two episodes per month due to Rolfe's other projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemassacre.com/2010/04/30/avgn-episode-90-action-52/ |title=AVGN: Episode 90 – "Action 52" |date=April 30, 2010 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2011, Rolfe announced the show would be put out of production for a short while so he could work on the AVGN movie. The show eventually resumed production in late summer 2012. Since then, he has self-released Nerd videos on his Cinemassacre website and YouTube account in a very sporadic manner in order to balance his personal life with the other projects he continuously works on. By 2013, the show garnered more 900,000 subscribers and over 400 million views on YouTube.&lt;ref name="Kotaku"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5974112/youtube-shuts-down-popular-angry-video-game-nerd-channel|title=YouTube Shuts Down Popular Angry Video Game Nerd Channel [Update: It's Back!]|publisher=''[[Kotaku]]''|first=Evan|last=Narcisse|accessdate=May 15, 2015}} January 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014, Cinemassacre already had 1.5 million subscribers. Rolfe stated that the show "got popular right around when YouTube got popular."&lt;ref name="NY"/&gt;

In January 2013, the YouTube channel was suddenly shut down due to claims of severe violations of YouTube's terms of service.&lt;ref name="Kotaku" /&gt; YouTube later reinstated the channel.&lt;ref name="Kotaku" /&gt;

In March 2016, the channel reached 2 million subscribers, 10 years after the channel's creation and first uploads. Rolfe made a short video to thank all the people who subscribed, watched the videos on the channel and for supporting himself, Mike Matei, and everyone who made Cinemassacre more popular.

In September 24, 2008, Rolfe collaborated with internet reviewer [[Doug Walker (actor)|Doug Walker]] to create a fictional feud between his character – [[Nostalgia Critic]] – and Rolfe's own. The plot behind the events created between the two was over the Critic's dislike towards comments made to one of his online videos that expressed similarities between him and the Nerd, supposedly written by the Nerd's fans, that were "unfair comparisons between the two of them". The pair worked together to create a series of tongue-in-cheek video responses between the two characters, culminating with a fight between the Critic and Nerd in Clifton, New Jersey, a dare between the pair to review something in the other's line of work (Nerd reviews a bad movie, Critic reviews a bad game), and a final fight between the pair in the Nerd's basement on October 10, 2008, which featured parodies and clichés from popular films such as ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]''. The resulting series of videos created became a huge hit with fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinemassacre.com/2008/10/10/avgn-vs-nostalgia-critic-the-final-battle/|accessdate=May 15, 2015|last=Matei|first=Mike|title=AVGN Vs.

|2014 || ''Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie''
|}

On 21 July 2014, an independent film based on the series, entitled '''''Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie''''', was released online as well as limited theatrical releases, with DVD and Blu-ray versions released by the end of the year. The film's plot focuses around the Nerd seeking to prove that over 1 million copies of the proclaimed "worst video game of all time", [[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (video game)|''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'']] for the [[Atari 2600]], were not [[Atari video game burial|buried]], after being pressured by fans to review the video game. In his quest to prove this to his fans, the Nerd finds himself being pursued by federal authorities who believe he is investigating [[Area 51]] and the crash of an [[unidentified flying object]].&lt;ref name="cinemassacre"&gt;{{cite web | title = Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie | url = http://cinemassacre.com/2012/11/10/avgn-the-movie-trailer/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film began development in late 2006, following the popularity of the ''Angry Video Game Nerd'' web series, with James Rolfe serving as its director, producer, and co-writer, and reprising his on-screen role as The Nerd. The movie's script was designed to pay homage to the character finally reviewing the ''E.T.'' video game, though filming required Rolfe to balance his schedule with that of his online series and other works. The screenplay was completed by 2008,&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinemassacre.com/2013/09/19/avgn-movie-timeline-updated-91913/|title=AVGN Movie Timeline|author=James Rolfe|publisher=Cinemassacre|date=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the film's budget of more than {{US$|300,000}} raised entirely from [[crowdfunding]].&lt;ref name="NY"/&gt; As part of its development, Rolfe asked for the show's fanbase to provide [[webcam]] footage of themselves fictionally reacting to the Nerd's webseries, to be used as an intro to the film.&lt;ref name="webcam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinemassacre.com/2013/10/13/avgn-movie-update-october-2013/|title=AVGN Movie Update – October 2013|author=James Rolfe|publisher=Cinemassacre|date=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Rolfe has not ruled out the possibility of a sequel to the film, he regards it as highly unlikely due to the amount of time spent developing and filming the ''Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie'' and his focus on other film projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What I'm Working On | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUkDry3WNjI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, an official video game titled ''Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures'' was announced. Developed by FreakZone Games (creators of ''[[Manos: The Hands of Fate (video game)|Manos: The Hands of Fate]]''), it was released on September 20, 2013 on [[Steam (software)|Steam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Steam|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/237740|title=Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures|accessdate=September 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game follows the Nerd attempting to rescue his friends, all of whom were sucked into the Nerd's television set (done in a ''[[The Cheetahmen|Cheetahmen]]''-esque style). The Nerd uses a [[NES Zapper]] as his main weapon, and a character known as Naggi the Patronizing Firefly, a parody of [[Navi (The Legend of Zelda)|Navi]] from ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'', guides him through the tutorial. Throughout the game, he faces zombies, [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Mr. Hyde]], [[Custer's Revenge|Custer]], [[The Giant Claw]], Fred "Fucks" ([[Fred Fuchs]]), both [[Jason Voorhees]] and an oversized version of [[Freddy Krueger]]'s right arm (references to the ''[[Friday the 13th (NES video game)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (video game)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' games respectively but their names were changed to Bimmy (Freddy Krueger) and Jimmy (Jason Voorhees) (referencing the infamous typo from ''[[Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones|Double Dragon III]]'') to avoid copyright) and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auIXluOfgoc|title=Let's Play AVGN Adventures – Part 4|publisher=YouTube|date=September 24, 2013|accessdate=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 12, 2014, it was announced that the game would also be released on [[Wii U]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/FreakZoneGames/status/488031219251425280|title=Wii U &amp; 3DS Announcement|publisher=Twitter|date=July 12, 2014|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wii U version was released in North America on April 2, 2015, and released in Europe on December 10, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures Gets a Wii U Launch Trailer|first=Alex|last=Carlson|website=Hardcore Gamer|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2015/04/02/angry-video-game-nerd-adventures-gets-a-wii-u-launch-trailer/142770/|date=April 2, 2015|accessdate=April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 4, 2015, a 3DS version became available for download in the Nintendo eShop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mynintendonews.com/2015/06/04/angry-video-game-nerd-adventures-arrives-on-nintendo-3ds-later-today/|title=Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures Arrives On Nintendo 3DS Later Today|date=June 4, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 17 of the same year, during [[ScrewAttack|ScrewAttack's]] annual SGC convention, Freakzone announced a sequel, ''Angry Video Game Nerd II: ASSimilation'', originally due for release in Winter 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUU5ThV4KLU|title=AVGN Returns for a Brand New Adventure – AVGN II: ASSimilation Debut Trailer|first=|last=ScrewAttack!|date=October 1, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; but delayed to March 29, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/237740/|title=Save 60% on Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures on Steam|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been some unofficial, fanmade Angry Video Game Nerd games including ''Angry Video Game Nerd's Angry Video Game'', ''Angry Video Game Nerd in Pixel Land Blast'', ''AVGN Game Over'', ''AVGN Game Over 2'', and ''AVGN Planet''. There is also the ''Angry Video Game Nerd'' and ''AVGN K.O. Boxing'', both for the [[Atari 2600]]. The Nerd touched upon these games in the episode ''AVGN Games''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinemassacre.com/2013/11/19/avgn-avgn-games/|accessdate=May 15, 2015|last=Matei|first=Mike|title=AVGN Games – Angry Video Game Nerd|date=November 19, 2013|publisher=''[[Cinemassacre]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nerd also appeared as a playable character in the game ''Texting of the Bread'' produced by [[ScrewAttack]].

The opening song of the show, simply entitled ''The Angry Video Game Nerd Theme Song'', is a staple of the series since its earliest conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kylejustinmusic.com/|accessdate=May 15, 2015|last=Justin|first=Kyle|title=Ten Years in the Making...|date=September 2, 2014|publisher=''Kyle Justin Official Website''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was written by Kyle Justin and James Rolfe, and performed by Justin. Over the years, the song had different variations to correspond with specials. Programmer and musician Lachlan Barclay published soundtrack album based on the web-series in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lachlanbarclay.bandcamp.com/album/the-angry-video-game-nerd-collection|accessdate=May 15, 2015|last= Barclay|first=Lachlan|title=The Angry Video Game Nerd Collection|date=May 1, 2011 |publisher=''Lachlan Barclay Official Website''}}&lt;/ref&gt; This earliest compilation of the show was created by Barclay due to demands from fans after he played the song on Video XYZ. Another compilation album was released in 2013 containing the music derived from the Nerd's video game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brawlcustommusic.com/game/2093 |accessdate=May 15, 2015 |last= |first= |dead-url=yes |title=Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures (soundtrack) |date= |publisher=''ScrewAttack Entertainment LLC'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518094540/http://www.brawlcustommusic.com/game/2093 |archivedate=May 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed also by FreakZone, the album was released by ScrewAttack Entertainment LLC as a digital download. An album based from the movie was released in 2014 composed by [[Bear McCreary]], who had previously worked with Rolfe on the webseries Christmas special. The film's music was composed of rock-and-roll, heavy metal, a symphonic orchestra, and synthesized musical elements from various gaming systems such as [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], and [[SEGA Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Bear McCreary's 'Angry Video Game Nerd' to be Released' |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/news/article/?id=1885 |date=August 27, 2014 |accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album features two remixes by McCreary as well.&lt;ref name="AVGNTM soundtrack"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/angry-video-game-nerd-theme/id912526380?i=912526588&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4 | title=Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) | date=September 2, 2014 |accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==

Rajski further said that "[Rolfe] already cultivated an audience that cared about his prior work. When he asked them to step up, clearly they were willing to."&lt;ref name="NY"/&gt; Fellow filmmaker and internet celebrity [[Nostalgia Critic|Doug Walker]] dubbed the Nerd as the "Greatest Video Game Critic of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://channelawesome.com/nostalgia-critic-avgn-movie/|accessdate=May 15, 2015|last=Walker|first=Doug|title=Nostalgia Critic: AVGN Movie|date=February 13, 2015|publisher=''[[Channel Awesome]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob Rich of ''[[Michigan Daily]]'' described the Nerd as the "pioneering internet 'gamer' show", adding that "pretty much every major game review show online today has 'AVGN' to thank for establishing its format".&lt;ref name="Michigan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/arts/09angry-video-game-nerd-movie-review12|title='Angry Video Game Nerd' movie a disappointing failure |publisher=''[[Michigan Daily]]''|first=Jacob |last=Rich|accessdate=May 15, 2015}} September 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The French show ''[[Joueur du Grenier]]'' was based on ''Angry Video Game Nerd''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://france.retrogaming.fr/dossiers/interview-frederic-molas-alias-le-joueur-du-grenier/|title = Frédéric Molas alias le Joueur du Grenier|website = France Retrogaming| language = fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zach Whalen described the show's presentation of retro gaming into contemporary gamers as "a process of looking back to an unattainable past and trying to bring that past into the present".&lt;ref name="Media"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tft.ucla.edu/mediascape/Winter2012_AngryVideoGameNerd.html|title=Revenge of the (Angry Video Game) Nerd: James Rolfe and Web 2.0 Fandom |publisher=''[[Mediascape]]''|first=Jim|last=Fleury|accessdate=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Rolfe also commented during an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' of the show's impact in the current generation of the video game industry, saying that they "still relate to it and they like learning of the past".&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/28/games-nostalgia-angry-video-game-nerd-youtube|title=Video games and nostalgia: Angry Video Game Nerd's YouTube empire |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|first=Luke|last=Langlands|accessdate=May 15, 2015}} February 28, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In the same article, reporter Luke Langlands also noted the show's influence of inspiring the creation of other independent online shows. The Nerd's success as an independent celebrity outside of the commercial mainstream of pop culture, popularized the notion of making lifelong careers online. In a survey published by ''Mediscape'', a number of people admitted to being inspired by the Nerd to create and submit their own content in various online spaces, including [[YouTube]], [[DeviantArt]], [[SourceForge]], [[GameFAQs]] and [[ScrewAttack]].&lt;ref name="Media"/&gt; ''[[WatchMojo.com|WatchMojo]]'' also called the Nerd as a "trendsetter" for other gamers and amateur reviewers online,&lt;ref name="Watchmojo2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watchmojo.com/video/id/13342/|title=Top 10 YouTube Video Game Reviewers – TopX Ep.11 |publisher=''[[WatchMojo.com|WatchMojo]]''|first=Dan|last=Paradis|accessdate=May 15, 2015}} January 29, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; influencing the likes of those such as the [[Nostalgia Critic]], [[Angry Joe]] and others.&lt;ref name="Media"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alex"/&gt;

In his analysis of the show and the character, writer Alex Carlson of ''[[Hardcore Gamer]]'', dubbed Rolfe's character as "The Nerd Who Changed Gaming Culture Forever". In his written article, he described the Angry Video Game Nerd as "one of the most recognizable figures in gaming culture", adding that "if you're a gamer, it's nearly guaranteed that you've browsed YouTube and seen at least a couple of videos from the series. Nearly a decade after the series' humble inception, James Rolfe's frequently sailor-mouthed alter-ego is still spreading influence. With each new gaming channel appearing on YouTube, there's some level of inspiration coming straight from The Nerd. From the very beginning, The Angry Video Game Nerd was a giant leap forward. Whether James Rolfe knew it or not, the rise of The Nerd was a moment that changed gaming critique and entertainment forever".&lt;ref name="Alex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/01/07/the-nerd-who-changed-gaming-culture-forever/68599/|title=The Nerd Who Changed Gaming Culture Forever |publisher=''[[Hardcore Gamer]]''|first=Alex |last=Carlson|accessdate=May 15, 2015}}January 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On their video of Top 10 Retro Gaming YouTubers, [[WatchMojo.com|WatchMojo]] named The Nerd and [[James Rolfe]] the number 1 Retro Gaming Youtuber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV-4Hn33exA|title=Top 10 Retro Gaming YouTubers|first=|last=WatchMojo.com|date=November 3, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carrie Nation.jpg|thumb|right|Carrie Nation, brandishing a hatchet]]
A '''battle-axe''' is a term, generally considered pejorative, for an aggressive, domineering and forceful woman.  The prime example was the militant [[temperance movement|temperance]] activist [[Carrie Nation]], who wielded a [[hatchet]] and made it her symbol, living in ''Hatchet Hall'' and publishing a magazine called ''The Hatchet''.  She became involved in the [[suffragette]] campaign for votes for women and this campaign further established the archetype.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Encyclopedia of women social reformers |volume=1 |author=[[Helen Rappaport]] |pages=478–479 |chapter=Nation, Carry (1846-1911) |isbn=978-1-57607-101-4 |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Carry A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4780">The '''New York Dance and Performance Awards''', also known as the '''Bessie Awards''' are awarded annually for exceptional achievement by independent dance artists presenting their work in New York City. The broad categories of the awards are: choreography, performance, music composition and visual design. The Bessie Awards were established in 1983.

==History and description==
The Bessie Awards were established in 1983 by [[Dance Theater Workshop]] and named in honor of [[Bessie Schonberg]], an influential mid-20th-century teacher of modern dance and former head of the dance department at Sarah Lawrence College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunning|first1=Jennifer|title='Bessies' to Be Awarded Sept. 13 for Achievement in Dance|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/20/arts/bessies-to-be-awarded-sept-13-for-achievements-in-dance.html|accessdate=17 October 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=20 August 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The awards honor exceptional choreography, performance, music composition and visual design in dance and allied art forms.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;  Nominees and award winners are chosen by the Bessie Selection Committee, which consists of dancers, dance presenters, producers, choreographers, journalists, critics and academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/11/arts/dance/11bessies.html |title=Bessies Are Back After a Hiatus, Primed for a Major Makeover |work= [[The New York Times]]|date=10 September 2010| first= Gia| last= Kourlas| accessdate= 18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Beyond Good &amp; Evil''''' is a 2003 [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Ubisoft]] for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Personal computer|PC]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[GameCube]] [[video game console|platforms]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamesradar.com/why-beyond-good-evil-one-greatest-games-ever-made/&lt;/ref&gt; The story follows the adventures of [[Jade (Beyond Good &amp; Evil)|Jade]], an [[Investigative journalism|investigative reporter]] and [[Martial arts|martial artist]], who works with a [[resistance movement]] to reveal a planet-wide alien conspiracy. The player controls Jade and allies, solving puzzles, fighting enemies, and obtaining photographic evidence.

[[Michel Ancel]], creator of the ''[[Rayman]]'' series, envisioned the game as the first part of a trilogy. The game was developed under the codename "Project BG&amp;E" by 30 [[Ubisoft Pictures]] employees with production lasting more than three years. One of the main goals of the game is to create a meaningful story while giving players lots of freedom, though the game adopts a relatively linear structure. The game was received poorly when it was shown at [[E3 2002]], and it prompted the developers to change some of the game's elements, including Jade's design. Ancel also attempted to streamline the game in order to make the game more commercially appealing.

''Beyond Good &amp; Evil'' was critically acclaimed. Critics praised the game's animation, setting, story, and design, but criticized the game's combat and technical issues. The game received a nomination for "Game of the Year" at the 2004 [[Game Developers Choice Awards]]. While the game had a [[cult following]], it was considered a [[list of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]] at launch. A [[1080p|full HD]] re-mastered version of the game was released on [[Xbox Live Arcade]] in March 2011 and on [[PlayStation Network]] in June 2011. A prequel, ''[[Beyond Good and Evil 2]]'', is in development and was announced at E3 2017.&lt;ref name="GI-184"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Beyond good and evil-combat.png|thumb|left|Jade attacking an enemy called ''Crochax'' and gaining credits from a previously defeated enemy.|alt=Back view of a woman in green-grey clothes swinging a staff and attacking a large winged creature with claws and a circular, toothed mouth. Game information such as lives displayed and a picture of the woman are displayed in the upper left and right corners of the screen, floating above the other elements.]]
''Beyond Good &amp; Evil'' is an action-adventure game with elements of [[puzzle video game|puzzle-solving]] and [[stealth game|stealth-based]] games.&lt;ref name="gspot-pc review"/&gt; The player controls the [[protagonist]], Jade, from a [[Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. Jade can run, move stealthily, jump over obstacles and pits, climb ladders, push or bash doors and objects, and flatten herself against walls.&lt;ref name="movement-pc manual"&gt;{{cite book|year=2003|title=Beyond Good &amp; Evil Instruction Manual (PC version)|url=http://store.steampowered.com/manual/15130|publisher=Ubisoft|pages=7–8|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Jade, the player investigates a number of installations in search of the truth about a war with an alien threat.&lt;ref name="gspot-pc review"/&gt;

In the game's interior spaces, the player solves puzzles and makes their way past enemies in order to reach areas containing photographic evidence.&lt;ref name="gspot-pc review"/&gt; Jade's main tools are her [[Jō|Daï-jo]] combat staff (a [[melee weapon]]), discs for attacking at range, and a camera.&lt;ref name="ign-pc review"/&gt; Jade's health, represented by hearts, decreases when hit by enemy attacks. It can be restored using fictional food items and can be increased beyond the maximum with "PA-1s" that, when held by Jade or her companions, increases their life gauge by one heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2003|title=Beyond Good &amp; Evil Instruction Manual (PC version)|url=http://store.steampowered.com/manual/15130|publisher=Ubisoft|page=12|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Jade's health is depleted, the game will restart at the last [[Continue point|checkpoint]]. Certain stealth segments later in the game automatically kill Jade if she is detected.

At times, it is only possible to advance in the game with the help of other characters. These characters are [[artificial intelligence|computer-controlled]], and players direct them via contextual commands.&lt;ref name="gspot-pc review"/&gt; For example, the player can order them to perform a "super attack", either pounding the ground to bounce enemies into the air, allowing the player to hit them from long distances, or knocking them off balance, making them vulnerable to attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond Good &amp; Evil Manual (Gamecube)|publisher=Ubisoft|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These allies possess a health bar and are incapacitated if it is depleted. Jade can share some of her items, such as PA-1s, with these characters.

In addition to obtaining evidence and completing assignments, Jade's camera can take pictures of animal species in exchange for currency, and scan objects to reveal more information about the environment.&lt;ref name="ign-pc review"/&gt; When the "Gyrodisk Glove" is obtained, Jade can attack enemies or activate devices from a distance by using the camera interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond Good &amp; Evil Manual (Gamecube)|publisher=Ubisoft|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also various [[minigame]]s and sub-missions offered by [[Non-player character|NPCs]] scattered throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://uk.ign.com/articles/2003/05/14/e3-2003-beyond-good-and-evil |title= E3 2003: Beyond Good and Evil |date= May 14, 2003 |accessdate= July 19, 2013 |work= [[IGN]] |publisher= Ziff Davis Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[hovercraft]] is used to travel around the world, and also used for racing and in other minigames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/time-extend-beyond-good-evil/2/|title=Time Extend: Beyond Good &amp; Evil|author=Edge Staff|date=September 29, 2009|page=2|publisher=Edge Online|accessdate=September 2, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618143249/http://www.edge-online.com/features/time-extend-beyond-good-evil/2/|archivedate=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[Spacecraft|spaceship]] ''Beluga'' is acquired. The hovercraft can dock with the spaceship. Both vehicles require upgrades in order to reach new areas and progress through the game. Upgrades are purchased using pearls that are collected throughout the game, by completing missions, exploring areas, filling in the animal directory or by trading credits for them. The vehicles have a boost ability, and can be repaired using a "Repair Pod" if damaged by enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2003|title=Beyond Good &amp; Evil Instruction Manual (PC version)|url=http://store.steampowered.com/manual/15130|publisher=Ubisoft|page=13|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

===Setting and characters===
''Beyond Good &amp; Evil'' takes place in the year [[25th century|2435]] on the mining planet of Hillys, located in a remote section of the galaxy.&lt;ref name="GS Preview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-good-and-evil-updated-preview/1100-6078963/|title= Beyond Good and Evil Updated Preview|last=Torres|first=Ricardo|date=November 6, 2003|work=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=June 5, 2015|dead-url=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150605195519/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-good-and-evil-updated-preview/1100-6078963/|archivedate=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[architecture]] of the city around which the game takes place is [[History of architecture#Europe to 1600|rustic European]] in style. The world itself combines modern elements, such as [[email]] and [[credit card]]s, with those of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]], such as spaceships and [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals coexisting with humans.&lt;ref name="Edge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/time-extend-beyond-good-evil|title=Time Extend: Beyond Good &amp; Evil|author=Edge Staff|date=October 5, 2009|page=1|publisher=Edge Online|accessdate=March 16, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509210944/http://www.edge-online.com/features/time-extend-beyond-good-evil|archivedate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the game begins, Hillys is under siege by aliens called the "DomZ", who abduct beings and either drain their [[Energy (esotericism)|life force]] for power or implant them with [[spore]]s to convert them into [[Slavery|slave]]s.&lt;ref name="GS Preview"/&gt; Prior to the opening of the game, a [[military dictatorship]] called the "Alpha Sections" has come to power on Hillys, promising to defend the populace.&lt;ref name="ign-pc review"/&gt; However, the Alpha Sections seem unable to stop the DomZ despite its public assurances. An underground resistance movement, the IRIS Network, fights the Alpha Sections, believing it to be in league with the DomZ.&lt;ref name="globe-review"&gt;{{cite news|author=Nowak, Pete|date=2004-02-20|title=Beyond Good &amp; Evil|work= The Globe and Mail|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Beyond Good &amp; Evil''{{'}}s main protagonist, Jade (voiced by Jodi Forrest), is a young photojournalist. She resides in an island lighthouse that doubles as a home for children orphaned by DomZ attacks. Pey'j (voiced by [[David Gasman]]), a boar-like creature, is Jade's uncle and guardian figure.&lt;ref name="ign-pc review"/&gt; Double H, a heavily built human IRIS operative, assists Jade during missions. He wears a military-issue suit of armor at all times. Secundo, an artificial intelligence built into Jade's storage unit, the "Synthetic-Atomic-Compressor" (SAC), offers advice and "digitizes" items. The main antagonists are the DomZ High Priest, who is the chief architect of the invasion, and Alpha Sections leader General Kehck, who uses [[propaganda]] to gain the Hillyans' trust, even as he abducts citizens to sustain the DomZ.

===Story===
Jade and Pey'j are taking care of the children of Hillys orphaned by the DomZ. When meditating with one of the orphans outside, a DomZ siren sounds. Jade rushes to turn to turn the power on for the shield. She discovers she has run out of credits to pay for the shield. The lighthouse is left vulnerable to the meteor shower. One of the Domz meteors crashes outside of the lighthouse. The DomZ monsters catches each of the children into their bodies. Jade is forced to fight these creatures to free the children. Jade then looks down into the hole left by meteor and is captured by a DomZ Monster. Jade is rescued by Pey'j and they work together to defeat the monster. The Alpha Sections arrive just after Jade defeats the monster. 

Secunda finds a photography job for Jade, so that she can pay to turn the power back on for the sheild. The job involves cataloging all the species on Hillys for a [[science museum]]. Jade is then contacted by a "man in black" to investigate and take pictures of a creature presumed to be DomZ twins in an abondoned mine on an abandoned island. The DomZ twins turns out the be antennae of a very large  DomZ monster. Once defeated the "man in black" takes off his suit and a taxi car flies out of the black limousine. The man reveals he actually works for IRIS network. 

She is recruited by the IRIS Network, which suspects that the Alpha Sections are behind planet-wide disappearances. Jade's first target of investigation is an Alpha Sections-run ration factory. She discovers evidence of [[human trafficking]] orchestrated by the DomZ under the Alpha Sections' authority. Along the way she rescues Double H, who was kidnapped and tortured by the DomZ. Pey'j is abducted by the DomZ and taken to an abandoned [[slaughterhouse]] where he and the other kidnapped victims are to be launched to a base on Hillys' moon, Selene. After failing to extract Pey'j from the slaughterhouse in time, Jade learns that he was, in fact, the secret chief of the IRIS Network.

Jade learns that the Alpha Sections are being possessed and manipulated by the DomZ. Using ''Beluga'', the ship Pey'j used to travel to Hillys, Jade and Double H go to the DomZ lunar base. There, Jade finds Pey'j dead after weeks of torture, but a strange power inside her brings back his soul, reviving him. After rescuing Pey'j, destroying Kehck's command ship, transmitting her final report, and sparking a [[revolution]], Jade confronts the DomZ High Priest. She learns that her human form is the latest container to hide a power stolen from the DomZ centuries ago in the hope that the High Priest, who must have spirit energy to survive, would starve to death. The High Priest managed to find a substitute energy in the souls of all those kidnapped from Hillys, and captures Pey'j and Double H to force Jade to submit to him. Using the stolen power within her, Jade is able to destroy the High Priest, though nearly losing control of her soul in the process, and then revives and rescues those that have been abducted. In a [[post-credits scene]] back on Hillys, a DomZ spore grows on Pey'j's hand as the screen fades to black.

Ancel said that the linear nature of the gameplay was necessary to convey the story; player freedom was an experience between parts of the plot.&lt;ref name="gamespy-ancel interview"/&gt; He also strove to create a rhythm similar to a movie to engage and delight players.&lt;ref name="OPM-71"&gt;{{cite journal| journal = [[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]| title = Beyond Good &amp; Evil Hands On| publisher = [[Future plc|Future Publishing]]| issue = 71| page = 65|date=August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game drew on many influences and inspirations, including the [[Styles and themes of Hayao Miyazaki|Miyazaki universe]], politics and the media, and the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name="eurogamer-out of touch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Purchese|first=Robert|date=April 3, 2009|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/ancel-thinks-zelda-is-out-of-touch|title=BG&amp;E2 inspired by September 11|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=April 6, 2010|dead-url=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130234852/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/ancel-thinks-zelda-is-out-of-touch|archivedate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In creating the lead character, Ancel's wife reportedly inspired the designer, who wanted to portray a persona with whom players could identify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&amp;cId=3137700 |title=Getting the Girl |page=2 |publisher=1UP.com |date=January 9, 2005 |first=Zoe |last=Flower |accessdate=June 5, 2015 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120720074531/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&amp;cId=3137700 |archivedate=July 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Beyond Good &amp; Evil'' was first shown publicly at the 2002 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], where it received a negative reception.&lt;ref name="Ubi-Uncensored"/&gt; Originally more "artistically ambitious" and resembling games like ''[[Ico]]'', the game was substantially changed in order to make it more commercially appealing. Jade, originally a teenage girl, was redesigned to be more powerful and befitting of her job. The game was also shortened by removing long periods of exploration, due to Ancel's dislike of this aspect of gameplay in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]]''. The development team was "demoralized" by the changes, with Ancel commenting that the finished game resembled a sequel more than a reworking.&lt;ref name="Edge"/&gt; Prior to release, playable previews of the game were offered in movie theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1542187/gamefile-peter-jacksons-mission-big-screen-gears-of-war-and-more/|title=GameFile: Peter Jackson's Mission; Big-Screen 'Gears Of War' And More|last=Totilo|first=Stephen|date=October 3, 2006|publisher=MTV.com|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio===
The soundtrack of ''Beyond Good &amp; Evil'' was composed by [[Christophe Héral]], who was hired by Ancel because of his background in film. Hubert Chevillard, a [[film director|director]] with whom Ancel had worked in the past, had also worked with Héral on a [[television special]], ''The Pantin Pirouette'', and referred him to Ancel. Héral was assisted by Laetitia Pansanel, who [[orchestration|orchestrated]] the pieces, and his brother Patrice Héral, who performed some of the sound effects and singing.&lt;ref name="Heralinterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgemyth.net/?page=plus_d_infos/creation_du_jeu/interview_christophe_heral/interview_christophe_heral.php |title=Christophe Héral Interview |publisher=Beyond Good &amp; Evil Myth |language=French |accessdate=November 6, 2009 |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101215717/http://www.bgemyth.net/?page=plus_d_infos%2Fcreation_du_jeu%2Finterview_christophe_heral%2Finterview_christophe_heral.php |archivedate=November 1, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The soundtrack incorporates a wide variety of languages and instruments from around the world. Mainly [[Bulgaria]]n lyrics were chosen for the song "Propaganda", which plays in the game's Akuda Bar,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamesradar.com/game-music-of-the-day-beyond-good-evil/&lt;/ref&gt; to allude to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] propaganda of the [[Cold War]]. It uses a recording of a [[telephone]] conversation by Héral with a female Bulgarian friend to represent the government's control of the [[media (communication)|media]]. It also incorporates Arabic [[string instrument]]s and Indian [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]. A song called "Funky Mullah" was originally planned for the Akuda Bar, but it was replaced by "Propaganda" because Héral decided that its [[muezzin]] vocals, recorded on September 8, 2001, would have been in bad taste in the wake of the September 11 attacks. "Fun and Mini-games", a song that plays during hovercraft races and other minigames, includes Spanish lyrics. The lyrics for DomZ music were created from a fictional language with prominent [[alveolar trill|rolling "r"]] sounds. The crashing metal sound effects of "Metal Gear DomZ", the music played during a boss fight, were recorded from the son of Héral's neighbor playing with [[Scrap|scrap metal]]. The voices in the city of Hillys were also recorded by Héral himself.&lt;ref name=Heralinterview/&gt; The music has never been published as an album, though it has been released in its entirety as a free download by Ubisoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snarfed.org/beyond_good_and_evil_soundtrack|title=Beyond Good &amp; Evil soundtrack|date=January 1, 2003|publisher=Snarfed.org|accessdate=July 1, 2009|dead-url=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319103115/https://snarfed.org/beyond_good_and_evil_soundtrack|archivedate=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack is featured in the [[Video Games Live]] international concert tour.&lt;ref name="VGL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogameslive.com/index.php?s=info|title=Video Games Live|publisher=[[Video Games Live]]|accessdate=June 5, 2015|dead-url=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224122623/http://videogameslive.com/index.php?s=info|archivedate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to its release, ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]'' and ''[[PlayStation: The Official Magazine|PlayStation Magazine]]'' praised the game's showing at the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo and described it as one of the best titles on display.&lt;ref name="OPM-71"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal = [[PlayStation: the Official Magazine|PlayStation Magazine]]| title = E3 2003| publisher = [[Future plc|Future Publishing]]| issue = 74| page = 48|date=August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Beyond Good &amp; Evil'' received generally positive reviews from critics. Aggregating review website [[Metacritic]] gave the Xbox version 87/100,&lt;ref name="MCXBOX" /&gt; the GameCube version 87/100,&lt;ref name="MCGC" /&gt; the PlayStation 2 version 86/100,&lt;ref name="MCPS2" /&gt; the Xbox 360 version 84/100,&lt;ref name="MCX360" /&gt; the PlayStation 3 version 83/100&lt;ref name="MCPS3" /&gt; and the PC version 83/100.&lt;ref name="MCPC" /&gt;

The game's graphics were generally well received. In reviewing the GameCube version, ''[[Game Informer]]'' wrote that "Every moment of ''Beyond Good &amp; Evil'' looks as good as a traditional [[Role-playing game|RPG]] [[cutscene]]" and that the game's effects and character animations were "amazing."&lt;ref name="gi-gc review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/D989B470-043B-4A32-9CA9-DEB773C849DA.htm?CS_pid=220353|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012135808/http://gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/D989B470-043B-4A32-9CA9-DEB773C849DA.htm?CS_pid=220353|archivedate=October 12, 2007 |title=Beyond the Norm|publisher=[[Game Informer]]|date= |accessdate=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Jon Hicks of ''PC Format'' wrote that while some effects were excellent, the game's otherwise unspectacular graphics were unwelcome reminders of the game's console roots.&lt;ref name="pc format-review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcformat.co.uk/reviews/default.asp?pagetypeid=2&amp;articleid=28625&amp;subsectionid=680|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206144725/http://www.pcformat.co.uk/reviews/default.asp?pagetypeid=2&amp;articleid=28625&amp;subsectionid=680|archivedate=February 6, 2008|title=Beyond Good and Evil|last=Hicks|first=Jon|year=2004|work=PC Format|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1UP.com]] and ''Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine'' cited glitches such as [[frame rate]] as irksome, because the game did not appear to tax the console's hardware.&lt;ref name="1up-ps2 review"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff |date=January 1, 2000 |url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/beyond-good-evil_7 |title=Beyond Good and Evil (PS2) Reviews; Beyond good gameplay, with some really evil glitches |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=January 20, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6eu52JxmY?url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/beyond-good-evil_7 |archivedate=January 29, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ops2m-review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playstationmagazine.com/article2/0,4364,1372587,00.asp |title=Beyond Good and Evil (PS2) |last=Steinman |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031231232454/http://www.playstationmagazine.com/article2/0%2C4364%2C1372587%2C00.asp |archivedate=December 31, 2003 |first=Gary |date=November 4, 2003 |work=[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]] |accessdate=May 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' commended the game for its storytelling and design, but criticized its plot as unable to "match Jade's initial appeal," becoming "fairly mundane" without "the darkness and moral ambiguity suggested by the title," with Jade's [[everyman]] appeal undermined by the revelation of her "mysterious hidden identity." Dan Toose of ''[[Sydney Morning Herald|SMH]]'' called the game's setting "dark, baroque and earthy, a far cry from the squeaky-clean action of the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games," and described the game as "a very European take on the role-playing genre" and "one of the best adventure games in years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/05/1070351782307.html|title=Die Hard|last=Toose|first=Dan|date=December 6, 2003|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=March 19, 2010|dead-url=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105205705/http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/05/1070351782307.html|archivedate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Star Dingo of ''[[GamePro]]'' commented that the game was a "[[jack of all trades, master of none]]" that "never really lives up to its title," adding that its vision could have been more focused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/31690/beyond-good-and-evil/|title=Beyond Good and Evil|last=Dingo|first=Star|date=November 12, 2003|publisher=[[GamePro]]|accessdate=March 20, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202052524/http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/31690/beyond-good-and-evil/|archivedate=December 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among complaints were control issues and a lack of gameplay depth.

''Beyond Good &amp; Evil'' was not a commercial success. The game saw poor sales upon its release in the 2003 [[Christmas and holiday season]]. Retailers quickly decreased the price by up to 80&amp;nbsp;percent. ''Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine'' staff attributed the poor sales of the game—among many other 2003 releases—to an over-saturated market, and labeled ''Beyond Good &amp; Evil'' as a commercial "disappointment".&lt;ref name="OPM-78"&gt;{{cite journal| journal = [[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]| publisher = [[Ziff Davis]]| title = Spin: Bad Timing| issue = 78| pages = 30–31|date=March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retrospect, Ancel noted that consumers at the time were interested in established franchises and technologically impressive games. Coupled with the number of "big titles" available, he stated that the market was a poor environment for ''Beyond Good &amp; Evil'' and that it would take time to be appreciated.&lt;ref name="Ubi-Uncensored"/&gt; The ''Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine'' staff further commented that the lack of marketing from Ubisoft and the game's odd premise naturally reserved it to obscurity.&lt;ref name="OPM-78"/&gt; Part of the disappointing sales stemmed from Ubisoft not knowing how to market the title,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=IGN AU Staff|date=February 19, 2009|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/02/17/beyond-good-evil-2-what-to-expect|title=Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2: What to Expect|page=1|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=Ziff Davis|accessdate=May 8, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220012314/http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/954/954480p1.html|archivedate=February 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; something that Ubisoft North America CEO Laurent Detoc labeled as one of his worst business decisions.&lt;ref name="Development"&gt;{{cite web|last=Detoc|first=Laurent|date=August 23, 2005 |title=Executive Profile |work=[[American City Business Journals|San Francisco Business Times]]|url=http://sanfrancisco.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2007/11/05/tidbits2.html |accessdate=December 4, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120185035/http://sanfrancisco.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2007/11/05/tidbits2.html|archivedate=November 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Ubisoft's marketing efforts were more focused on the release of ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]''.&lt;ref name="OPM-78"/&gt; Ubisoft's former North American vice-president of publishing, Jay Cohen, and its European managing director, Alaine Corre, attributed the commercial failure of the game to a lack of marketing.

===Awards and legacy===
''Beyond Good &amp; Evil'' was nominated for and won many gaming awards.

On April 27, 1986, American [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]] and business owner '''John R. MacDougall''', using the pseudonym '''Captain Midnight''', [[Broadcast signal intrusion|jammed]] the [[HBO|Home Box Office]] (HBO) [[Satellite television|satellite signal]] on [[Galaxy 1]] during a showing of the film ''[[The Falcon and the Snowman]]''. He broadcast a message lasting four and a half minutes, seen by the eastern half of the United States (accounting for more than half of HBO's 14.6 million subscribers at the time) protesting HBO's rates for [[satellite dish]] owners, which he considered too expensive. MacDougall was working at his second job as an operations engineer at the Central Florida [[Ground station#Telecommunications port|Teleport]] uplink station in [[Ocala, Florida]], and fought with a technician at HBO's communications center in [[Hauppauge, New York|Hauppauge, Long Island]], for control of the transmission. The technician attempted to increase uplink power but gave up because of the risk of damaging the satellite. MacDougall eventually abandoned his control of the satellite.

Although the intrusion was a minor annoyance to viewers, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) with assistance from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] investigated the jamming. After the FCC determined the suitable transmitters and stations equipped with a specific character generator, MacDougall surrendered to the authorities and was served with a court [[subpoena]] after a tourist overheard him discussing the incident on a pay phone off [[Interstate 75 in Florida|Interstate 75]]. Under an agreement with the prosecutor, he [[Plea bargaining in the United States|plea bargained]] and received a $5,000 fine, one year unsupervised probation, and his amateur radio license was suspended for a year. The jamming received much attention in American society, with one executive dubbing the intrusion an act of "video terrorism". As a consequence of the incident, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act|Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986]] ([[Title 18 of the United States Code|18 U.S.C]]. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1367 § 1367]), making satellite hijacking a [[felony]]. The [[Automatic Transmitter Identification System (television)|Automatic Transmitter Identification System]] was also developed in response to this incident.

==Background==

===Scrambling of satellite transmissions===
Beginning in the 1920s, [[Terrestrial television|broadcast television]] was delivered for free over local frequencies. When the industry began charging viewers for access to its services via [[Cable television in the United States|cable]] around this period in time, free broadcasts continued. Starting in the 1970s, a small community of satellite television enthusiasts (mostly engineers) shared the technology and knowledge on how to construct [[satellite dish]]es, as well as how to access pay television from the airwaves for free.&lt;ref name="forbeshijacker"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidewalt/2013/03/18/the-tale-of-captain-midnight-tv-hacker-and-folk-hero/#286308a41053|title=The Tale of Captain Midnight, TV Hacker And Folk Hero|last=Ewalt|first=David M.|date=March 18, 2013|work=[[Forbes]]|access-date=September 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920143534/https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidewalt/2013/03/18/the-tale-of-captain-midnight-tv-hacker-and-folk-hero/#286308a41053|archive-date=September 20, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not illegal at the time, and restaurant and hotel chains made use of this technology to distribute programming to guests and patrons without charge.&lt;ref name=mentalflossfeb2016/&gt;

In the mid-1980s, controversy erupted in the cable programming world as United States media companies that owned pay television channels began [[scrambler|scrambling]] their programming and charging fees to home satellite dish owners who accessed the same satellite signals that cable operators received. Many satellite dish owners faced the prospect of having to purchase descrambling equipment at a cost of hundreds of dollars, as well as having to pay monthly or annual subscription fees to cable programming providers. Fees for home dish owners were often higher than fees paid by cable subscribers, despite dish owners being responsible for acquiring and servicing their own equipment.&lt;ref name=mentalflossfeb2016&gt;{{cite web|last=Rossen|first=Jake|title=When "Captain Midnight" Hacked HBO|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/75907/when-captain-midnight-hacked-hbo|work=[[Mental Floss]]|date=February 25, 2016|accessdate=September 20, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920142635/http://mentalfloss.com/article/75907/when-captain-midnight-hacked-hbo|archivedate=September 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[HBO|Home Box Office]] (HBO) began scrambling its signal on a 24-hour basis on January 15, 1986, it offered subscriptions to home dish owners for $12.95 per month ($28.92 in 2017 dollars), which was either equal to or slightly higher than what cable subscribers paid. HBO also advised viewers that purchasing a descrambler for $395 ($882.21 in 2017 dollars) would (along with the monthly fee) allow them to continue watching HBO.&lt;ref name=nytimesapr86&gt;{{cite web|agency=[[Associated Press]]|title=Video pirate interrupts HBO|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/28/arts/video-pirate-interrupts-hbo.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=April 28, 1986|accessdate=May 20, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522074629/http://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/28/arts/video-pirate-interrupts-hbo.html|archivedate=May 22, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several satellite dish dealers across the United States closed their stores as a result of a reduction in dish sales, caused by the rise in signal scrambling.&lt;ref name=timemay1986&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=57887652&amp;site=ehost-live|title=Captain Midnight's Sneak Attack: A daring video intruder airs the beefs of dish owners|last1=Byers|first1=Jim|date=May 12, 1986|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=September 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921001142/http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=57887652&amp;site=ehost-live|archive-date=September 21, 2017|dead-url=no|last2=Cramer|first2=Jerome|issue=19|volume=127|page=100|registration=yes|last3=Zoglin|first3=Richard|via=EBSCO Information Services|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite dish owners began protests over keeping free access to broadcasts.&lt;ref name=phillytrail&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lyman|first1=Rick|last2=Borowski|first2=Neill|title=On The Trail Of 'Captain Midnight'|url=http://articles.philly.com/1986-04-29/news/26079191_1_satellite-transmissions-captain-midnight-satellite-industry-officials|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=April 29, 1986|accessdate=May 20, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521032227/http://articles.philly.com/1986-04-29/news/26079191_1_satellite-transmissions-captain-midnight-satellite-industry-officials|archivedate=May 21, 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such protest was by members of the Satellite Television Industry Association, who converged on [[Washington, D.C.]], in March 1986 to urge the [[United States Congress]] to protect access to satellite transmissions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flashback-hacker-interrupts-hbos-film-in-1986/|title=Flashback: Hacker interrupts HBO's film in 1986|last=Snyder|first=Joan|date=December 24, 2014|work=[[CBS News]]|access-date=September 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206121159/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/flashback-hacker-interrupts-hbos-film-in-1986/|archive-date=December 6, 2016|dead-url=no|last2=Spencer|first2=Susan|location=New York City, New York|author-link2=Susan Spencer|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John R. MacDougall===
[[File:Fort Lauderdale Skyline 7.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], where MacDougall was raised]]
John R. MacDougall was born in [[Elmhurst, Illinois]]; a western suburb of [[Chicago]]. He is the youngest of five children of building contractor Robert MacDougall and his wife Thelma, a homemaker. Shortly after his father's retirement in 1970, the family moved to Florida. He spent his childhood years tinkering with cars and CB radios. MacDougall was brought up in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], where he was educated at [[American Heritage School (Plantation, Florida)|American Heritage School]]. After two years of studying in a management engineering program at [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]], MacDougall abandoned his studies and found employment installing satellite dishes in [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]].&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;&lt;ref name=orlandonov86&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/229382970/?terms=Captain+Midnight|title=Capt.

In 1983, he opened the satellite dealership MacDougall Electronics in Ocala.&lt;ref name=mentalflossfeb2016/&gt; The company initially turned a healthy profit, but following the scrambling of HBO's signal on January 15, 1986, its turnover declined. Consequently, he reduced his expenses where possible and in the same month was offered a part-time job at the Central Florida [[Ground station#Telecommunications port|Teleport]] uplink station (which uplinked services to satellites) as an operations engineer to help him pay his bills.{{sfn|Wright|2012|p=130–139}} As he was not receiving any customers, MacDougall pulled all company advertising and saved money by switching off his [[air conditioning]]. He became increasingly reclusive during this period, watching television and reading magazines.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; MacDougall later said of the experience: "I have been watching the great American dream slip from my grasp."&lt;ref name=bargainconfirmed/&gt; At 12:49&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time]] (EST) on April 20,&lt;ref name=broadcastingjul86&gt;{{Cite journal|date=July 28, 1986|title='Captain Midnight' unmasked|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1986/BC-1986-07-28.pdf|journal=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable|Broadcasting]]|volume=111|issue=4|pages=90–91|issn=0007-2028|oclc=6318655|access-date=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; one week before the jamming, MacDougall transmitted a [[Test card|color bar test pattern]] that was superimposed on HBO's signal. This only lasted for a few seconds, and HBO did not investigate the incident as it had occurred during the overnight hours, and as a result very few people had been watching at the time.{{#tag:ref|The April 20 intrusion went unreported to the FCC until after the following week's jamming.&lt;ref name=broadcastingjul86/&gt;|group="n"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1986-07-23/news/0240090082_1_hbo-macdougall-captain-midnight|title=Ocala Man Dished Up That Warning For HBO|last1=Jean|first1=Charlie|last2=Reidy|first2=Chris|date=July 23, 1986|work=Orlando Sentinel|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521012458/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1986-07-23/news/0240090082_1_hbo-macdougall-captain-midnight|archive-date=May 21, 2014|dead-url=no|accessdate=May 20, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jamming==
On April 26, 1986, MacDougall worked at his shop as normal, and closed at 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. EST. After eating dinner, he reported to Central Florida Teleport with one other engineer on duty. The second engineer left at 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., leaving MacDougall to operate the building on his own. MacDougall oversaw the uplink of the movie ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'' as part of the evening's programming for the [[pay-per-view]] network People's Choice, which used Central Florida Teleport's facilities.{{sfn|Wright|2012|p=130–139}} After the film ended, he went through his regular routine.&lt;ref name="networkretrospective" /&gt; Before logging off, MacDougall set up [[SMPTE color bars]] and punched buttons on a Microgen MG-100 [[character generator]] that placed letters on the television screen.&lt;ref name=broadcastingjul86/&gt;&lt;ref name=networkretrospective/&gt; He spent a couple of minutes composing his message. MacDougall began his message with a polite greeting as he did not wish to be insulting. He selected the name "Captain Midnight" from a film he had recently seen: ''[[On the Air Live with Captain Midnight]]'' (not associated with the popular [[Captain Midnight|''Captain Midnight'' radio show]] of the 1940s).&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

==Investigation==
Galaxy 1 carried HBO on transponder 23 at a rate of 125 watts, with relay signals sent out at 6,385 [[Hertz#SI multiples|MHz]]. [[Mother Jones (magazine)|''Mother Jones'']] magazine determined that MacDougall could have potentially taken over the signals of three additional satellites. He could have taken control of the network feed of [[CBS]] had he positioned his satellite dish at the [[Telstar 301]] satellite, operated by [[AT&amp;T]], tuned at 6,065&amp;nbsp;MHz. He also could have taken over the foreign language feed of the [[Voice of America]] network by aiming his satellite dish at 72 degrees west longitude. The final theorized hijacking would have been aiming his satellite dish at 100 degrees west longitude, above the [[Galápagos Islands]], with a frequency setting of 293.375&amp;nbsp;MHz, thereby jamming the signal of [[United States Navy]] satellite Fleetsatcom 1. The magazine also posited that an amateur hobbyist could hijack the satellites that alerted American military forces to Soviet actions, creating confusion for world leaders and placing the world at risk of nuclear destruction.&lt;ref name="motherjones" /&gt;

Although the intrusion caused minor annoyance to viewers,&lt;ref name=bargainconfirmed/&gt; HBO contacted the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) and announced that the hijacker would face prosecution.&lt;ref name=timemay1986 /&gt; The commission's chief, Richard Smith, assembled staff in his office for an emergency meeting at the FCC headquarters eight hours after the intrusion to discuss how the culprit should be caught.&lt;ref name=orlandonov86/&gt; On April 28 the chairman of HBO, [[Michael J. Fuchs]], wrote to the FCC saying the company had received calls threatening to place Galaxy 1 into a different orbit,&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; but the company was unable to determine whether these were credible threats or not.{{sfn|Williams|2010|p=552–553}} Fuchs's letter additionally urged the commission to use all of its resources to capture the culprit.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; In the days after the jamming, more than 200 people called the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) to "confess" that they were Captain Midnight.&lt;ref name="forbeshijacker"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mentalflossfeb2016/&gt;

This method brought the number of potential stations down to twelve.&lt;ref name=orlandonov86/&gt; After FCC investigators visited these stations, there were now three prime suspects which included MacDougall.&lt;ref name=latimesjul86/&gt; The commission later learned an accountant from [[Wisconsin]] had overheard MacDougall bragging about the jamming at a payphone in a rest area off [[Interstate 75 in Florida|Interstate 75]] in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]], and obtained a license plate number of a car owned by MacDougall.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

==Arrest and prosecution==
Prior to the jamming, the FCC warned that anyone interfering with television signals would be harshly dealt with and MacDougall was charged after surrendering to the authorities following media and industry pressure.{{#tag:ref|The FCC is responsible for ensuring nobody interferes with the licensed airwaves transmitted in the United States.&lt;ref name=broadcastingjul86/&gt;|group="n"}}&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{sfn|Leverette et al.|2009|p=4}}&lt;ref name=latimesjul86/&gt; Investigators from the commission spoke to MacDougall in July (he lost his job at Central Florida Teleport beforehand due to the closure of People's Choice), asking him questions that led him to believe that the commission was aware of the incident.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; Two FCC agents visited MacDougall's house two weeks later along with U.S. Attorney Lawrence Gentile III, who served MacDougall with a [[subpoena]] to appear in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]]'s U.S. District Court.&lt;ref name=orlandonov86/&gt; In their meeting, MacDougall claimed not to have committed any crime. According to MacDougall, Gentile tried to make an agreement that if MacDougall discussed the incident, Gentile would be willing to recommend a small fine and probation to the judge. At that time, MacDougall stated that he started to feel that there was not enough evidence to convict him, and despite continuing to protest his innocence, MacDougall told Gentile he would attend court.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

MacDougall contacted attorney John Green Jr., who advised him the chances of him winning the case were 70 percent, and that a trial would be risky and costly.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; He faced being fined up to $100,000 and being sentenced to one year in prison if he was convicted. Furthermore, MacDougall was worried about going before the jury and lying to get himself acquitted. He thus changed his mind and agreed to cooperate fully with the FCC.&lt;ref name=orlandonov86/&gt; At his first hearing on the afternoon of July 22,&lt;ref name=broadcastingjul86/&gt; he pleaded guilty to the charge of "illegally operating a satellite uplink transmitter",&lt;ref name=latimesjul86/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/Captain-Midnight-Arrested-FCC-Says/id-deb8acefb1bf49f38a3a9da149683c20|title=Captain Midnight Arrested, FCC says|last=McCloskey|first=Bill|date=July 22, 1986|access-date=September 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921145108/http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/Captain-Midnight-Arrested-FCC-Says/id-deb8acefb1bf49f38a3a9da149683c20|archive-date=September 21, 2017|dead-url=no|agency=Associated Press|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; a violation of [[Title 47 of the United States Code|47 U.S.C.]] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/301 § 301].&lt;ref name=broadcastingjul86/&gt; Under an agreement with Gentile, MacDougall [[Plea bargaining in the United States|plea bargained]] and received a $5,000 fine, was put on unsupervised probation for one year, and had his amateur radio license suspended for one year.{{sfn|Leverette et al.|2009|p=4}}&lt;ref name=latimesjul86/&gt;&lt;ref name=wapojul86/&gt; Later, he was arraigned and freed on a $5,000 [[Bail|bond]].&lt;ref name=wapojul86/&gt; MacDougall's plea bargain was confirmed at his sentencing by Judge Howard T.

==Reaction==
MacDougall's jamming of HBO's satellite signal generated much publicity, and attracted attention from several sectors of society.{{sfn|Wright|2012|p=130–139}} The jamming was described by various press publications as either the first instance of high-technology terrorism, or the most widely watched instance of electronic graffiti in the world.{{Sfn|Himma|2007|p=3–4}} The [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Communications and Technology|House Communications Subcommittee]] planned to hold meetings concerning the issue of satellite jamming. Members of Congress showed interest, with those coming from states with extensive rural areas showing more sympathy to owners of satellite dishes.{{sfn|Wright|2012|p=130–139}} The hijacking raised concerns over satellite-borne communications: that data transmitted by business and military users would become potential targets.&lt;ref name=timemay1986 /&gt; MacDougall's action led to him being immediately regarded as coming close to being a [[folk hero]] amongst disgruntled satellite dish owners who felt unfairly treated.&lt;ref name=forbeshijacker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=Karyl|date=July 28, 1986|title=Capt.

Richard Acello, the editor of the home satellite dish magazine ''Satellite TV Week'', stated MacDougall had not been able to achieve folk hero status as had been widely reported in the press: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"He didn't have any No. 1 records written about him or anything like that, and that's always an indication." He added: "The whole event was misunderstood.

A group called the Captain Midnight Grassroots Cause was formed, and sold merchandise to help raise money for MacDougall to pay his legal fees.{{sfn|Wright|2012|p=130–139}} MacDougall found the constant media attention difficult to deal with, and was regularly bothered at home.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not regret trying to get the message out to corporate America about unfair pricing and restrictive trade practices. That was the impetus for doing what I did; that's the reason I jammed HBO; that's the reason I sent them a polite message. What I do regret is that I was young and fairly naïve in the ways of the media. I didn't grasp the fact that no one understood my motives and that everyone would make assumptions. Had I known that up front I would have been much more fervent in explaining my motivations. I had no animus and I had no malice in my heart.&lt;ref name="networkretrospective" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Comic Art''''' was a magazine, founded and edited by [[Todd Hignite]], which surveyed newspaper comic strips, magazine cartoon panels and [[comic book art]], both historical and contemporary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An Interview With Todd Hignite|url=http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/resources/interviews/5349/|accessdate=November 20, 2016|work=The Comics Reporter|date=July 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
''Comic Art'' was established in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comic Art Magazine #1 (Comic Art Magazine, 1)|url=https://www.amazon.com/Comic-Art-Magazine/dp/B003E1C38E|work=Amazon|accessdate=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first seven issues featured articles on [[Art Spiegelman]], [[Daniel Clowes]], [[Harvey Kurtzman]], [[Crockett Johnson]] and [[Frank King (cartoonist)|Frank King]]. According to critic [[Tom Spurgeon]], "''Comic Art'' is a comics publication that... has chosen to investigate the good and interesting no matter when it's been done."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/briefings/cr_reviews/822/ Tom Spurgeon (2005). ''Review of Comic Art #7.''] at ''The Comics Reporter''. Retrieved on November 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Zimmer was the publication's graphic design and art director for the first seven issues. The eighth and ninth issues were expanded considerably and published annually in book form by Buenaventura Press. Alvin Buenaventura assisted Hignite with editing these two issues, and they were designed and art directed by Jonathan Bennett.

It is not connected with the original [[fanzine]] ''Comic Art'', which was published (beginning in 1960) by [[Maggie Thompson|Maggie and Don Thompson]].

'''Crooner''' is an American epithet given primarily to male singers of [[jazz standards]], mostly from the [[Great American Songbook]], backed by either a full [[orchestra]], a [[big band]] or a piano. Originally it was an ironic term denoting a sentimental singing style made possible by the use of microphones. Some performers, such as [[Russ Columbo]], did not accept the term:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=p_wjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yiEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5345,2605998&amp;dq=russ+columbo&amp;hl=en |title=Russ Columbo Doesn't Croon |date=1 November 1931 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Journal]] |accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Sinatra]] once said that he did not consider himself or [[Bing Crosby]] "crooners".&lt;ref&gt;CBS Special [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LesuXaSkDDc "Sinatra The Legend"] recording of It Was A Very Good Year (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

This dominant popular vocal style coincided with the advent of radio broadcasting and [[electrical recording]]. Before the advent of the [[microphone]], popular singers like [[Al Jolson]] had to project to the rear seats of a theater, as did opera singers, which made for a very loud vocal style. The microphone made possible the more personal style.&lt;ref name="Crooners"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shsu.edu/~lis_fwh/book/roots_of_rock/support/crooner/EarlyCroonersIntro2.htm |title=The Coming of the Crooners |author=Whitcomb, Ian |work=Survey of American Popular Music |publisher=Sam Houston State University |accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Bowlly]], [[Gene Austin]], [[Art Gillham]] and, by some historical accounts, [[Vaughn De Leath]]&lt;ref&gt;''Father of Radio: The Autobiography of Lee de Forest'', 1950, page 351.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irving Settel, ''A Pictorial History of Radio'', p. 58, Grosset &amp; Dunlap (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; are often credited as inventors of the crooning style, but [[Rudy Vallée]] became far more popular,&lt;ref name="Crooners"/&gt; beginning in 1928.  He could be heard by anyone with a phonograph or a radio.&lt;ref name="Crooners"/&gt;  

:"In his popular radio program, which began with his floating greeting, 'Heigh ho, everybody,' beamed in from a New York City night club, he stood like a statue, surrounded by clean-cut collegiate band musicians and cradling a saxophone in his arms."

His first film, ''[[The Vagabond Lover]]'', was promoted with the line, "Men Hate Him! Women Love Him!"&lt;ref name="Crooners"/&gt; while his success brought press warnings of the "Vallee Peril": this "punk from Maine" with the "dripping voice" required mounted police to beat back screaming, swooning females at his vaudeville shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Rise of the Crooners: Gene Austin, Russ Columbo, Bing Crosby, Nick Lucas, Johnny Marvin, and Rudy Vallee |last1= Pitts |first1=Michael |last2= Hoffman |first2= Frank |series= Studies and Documentation in the History of Popular Entertainment, No. 2 |year=2002 |publisher=The Scarecrow Press |location=Lanham, Md. |isbn=0-8108-4081-2 |oclc=46976469 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Deb9AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=%22Vallee+Peril%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NLiYhqfZBo&amp;sig=jz5xP3qG1-lLpPHTuDJNfkzskjA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=glCHVO_xIcOngwSB34KYDA&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Vallee%20Peril%22&amp;f=false |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1930s the term "crooner" had taken on a pejorative connotation.&lt;ref name="Crooners"/&gt; Cardinal [[William Henry O'Connell|William O'Connell]] of [[Boston]] and the [[New York Singing Teachers Association]] (NYSTA) both publicly denounced the vocal form, O'Connell calling it "base", "degenerate", "defiling" and un-American and NYSTA adding "corrupt".&lt;ref name="Crooners"/&gt;  Even ''[[The New York Times]]'' predicted that crooning would be just a passing fad. The newspaper printed, "They sing like that because they can’t help it. Their style is begging to go out of fashion…. Crooners will soon go the way of tandem bicycles, mah jongg and midget golf."&lt;ref name="Crooners"/&gt; Voice range shifted from [[tenor]] (Vallée) to [[baritone]] ([[Russ Columbo]], [[Bing Crosby]]).&lt;ref name="Crooners"/&gt; Still, a 1931 record by Dick Robinson, "Crosby, Columbo &amp; Vallee", called upon men to fight "these public enemies" brought into homes via radio.&lt;ref name="Crooners"/&gt;

Although the term is rarely used to describe a female singer, Vaughn De Leath, [[Annette Hanshaw]], [[Mildred Bailey]] (at the beginning of her career) and [[Helen Rowland]] have been cited in the category of crooners.

The genre enjoyed popularity within the former [[Soviet Union]] with [[Mark Reizen]], [[Leonid Utyosov]], [[Pavel Lisitsian]], [[Georg Ots]], [[Oleg Anofriyev]], [[Muslim Magomayev (musician)|Muslim Magomayev]], and [[Joseph Kobzon]] leading the way.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} Their performances had a variety of influences including [[ballad (music)|ballads]] and [[swing music|swing]] and was included in popular film soundtracks.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

== Decline ==
After 1954 popular music became dominated by other styles, especially [[rock 'n' roll]], while the music of latter-day crooners such as [[Perry Como]] and [[Matt Monro]] was recategorized by radio stations as [[easy listening]] or [[adult contemporary]]. Crooners have remained popular among fans of traditional pop music, with contemporary performers such as [[Tony Bennett]], [[Barry Manilow]], [[Brian Evans (singer)|Brian Evans]], [[Richard Hawley]], [[Harry Connick Jr.]], [[Michael Bublé]], [[Neil Hannon]], [[Peter Cincotti]], [[Hamilton Leithauser]], [[Matteo Brancaleoni]] and [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]] keeping the form alive. [[Bing Crosby]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dick Powell]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[Andy Williams]], [[Bobby Darin]] and [[Jimmy Durante]] incorporated other popular styles into their music, such as [[blues]], [[dixieland]] and even native [[Hawaiian music]].{{citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Country crooners==
Due to the country songs popularized by Bing Crosby, the crooning style of singing became an enduring part of [[country music]].&lt;ref&gt;Bing Crosby, "I'm an Old Cowhand," original mono recordings from 1933-1944, ASV Mono, Living Era, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Bing Crosby achieved a million seller with his 1940 rendition of the song "[[New San Antonio Rose| San Antonio Rose]]", originally recorded by [[Bob Wills &amp; His Texas Playboys]]. In 1942 Perry Como had a smash hit with "[[Deep in the Heart of Texas]]"; Bing Crosby, who had an enormous influence on Perry Como, covered this song and took it to the #3 position in the US chart that same year. [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Jim Reeves]] and [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]] are especially well known for their country crooner standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1587136/nashville-skyline-remembering-eddy-arnold.jhtml|title=NASHVILLE SKYLINE: Remembering Eddy Arnold|last=Flippo|first=Chet|work=[[Country Music Television]]|date=8 May 2008|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6205510/a-tribute-to-country-crooner-jim-reeves-on-the-50th-anniversary-of-his-death|title=billboard.com: A Tribute to Country Crooner Jim Reeves on the 50th Anniversary of His Death|last=Dauphin|first=Chuck|date=1 August 2014|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/music/headlines/20131216-influential-country-crooner-ray-price-dies-at-87.ece|title= dallasnews.com: Influential country crooner Ray Price dies at 87|last=Wilonsky|first=Robert|date=16 December 2013|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dean Martin]] is rather famous for the country music he recorded in the period when he was working for Reprise Records. Fellow Italian-American crooner Perry Como recorded several albums with country producer [[Chet Atkins]] in Nashville. Regular, non-country crooners scored hits with pop versions of country-songs: Tony Bennett had a ''Billboard'' #1 hit in 1951 with his rendition of Hank Williams' "[[Cold, Cold Heart]]", which was also performed by Louis Armstrong; Perry Como had a ''Billboard'' #1 hit in 1953 with his version of "[[Don't Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes]]", a #1 country hit for its author [[Slim Willet]] and a #4 country hit for Ray Price; [[Guy Mitchell]] scored a ''Billboard'' #1 in 1959 with "[[Heartaches by the Number]]", a country-hit for Ray Price; Engelbert Humperdinck achieved a 1967 UK #1 hit with "[[Release Me (1946 song)|Release Me]]", another song already made famous by Ray Price in 1954. In 1970, Ray Price had a #1 U.S. country hit and a #11 ''Billboard'' Hot 100 hit with the song "[[For the Good Times (song)|For the Good Times]]" written by [[Kris Kristofferson]]; subsequently Perry Como's rendition reached #7 in 1973 on the UK Singles Chart.

At that pageant she also met International Teen titleholder, Laryssa Bonacquisti, a young ventriloquist who inspired her to try ventriloquism herself.&lt;ref name=ok&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDonnell|first1=Brandy|title=Interview, photos and video: 12-year-old Oklahoma City ventriloquist Darci Lynne Farmer prepares to go back on 'America's Got Talent' |url=http://newsok.com/article/5558909|work=[[The Oklahoman|NewsOK]]|date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then asked her parents, Clarke and Misty Farmer, for a puppet, insisting that it would overcome her shyness. On her tenth birthday, her parents presented her with a puppet. Farmer's idol is past ''America's Got Talent'' winner [[Terry Fator]]. Because ventriloquism is not very common, Farmer made a commitment that she personally wanted to keep the art of ventriloquism alive.

In 2014, she entered ''Edmond's Got Talent'' where she won first prize after a month's preparation on Bonacquisti's tips. She was soon brought to the attention of ventriloquy coach Gary Owen, who was so impressed by Farmer's skill that he voluntarily agreed to be her coach and business manager.&lt;ref name=tds&gt;{{cite web|last=Hurst|first=Steve|title=A New Star is Born|work=The Dummy Shoppe|url=http://thedummyshoppe.com/blog/a-new-star-is-born/|date=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then she has worked with Owen and vocal teacher Tiana Plemons.&lt;ref name=ok/&gt; In 2015, she won first place in both the junior division at ''Oklahoma's Got Talent'' and ''Oklahoma Kids'', and won Broadway, Specialty Acts, and overall Entertainer of the Year at ''American Kids'' in [[Branson, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Franklin|first1=Dallas|title=Young Oklahoma girl shows off her ventriloquism skills for KFOR ahead of national debut|url=http://kfor.com/2016/03/25/young-oklahoma-girl-shows-off-her-ventriloquism-skills-for-kfor-ahead-of-national-debut/|work=[[KFOR-TV|KFOR]]|date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, Farmer made an appearance on ''[[Little Big Shots]]'', performing "[[I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart]]" with Katie,&lt;ref name=lbs&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stubblebine|first1=Allison|title=Watch All of Darci Lynne Farmer's 'Little Big Shots' Appearances Before She Won 'AGT'|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/television/7973555/darci-lynne-farmer-little-big-shots-performances-videos-agt-winner|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in July 2016, she became the first child ventriloquist ever to perform on an evening show in the 40-year history of the ''[[Vent Haven Museum|Vent Haven]] International Ventriloquists' ConVENTion'', where she fronted for celebrity ventriloquists [[Kevin Johnson (ventriloquist)|Kevin Johnson]] and Todd Oliver.&lt;ref name=tds/&gt; Then, in March 2017, she appeared on the British version of ''[[Little Big Shots (UK TV series)|Little Big Shots]]'', again performing "I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart" with Katie.&lt;ref name=lbs/&gt;

==Career==

===2017: ''America's Got Talent''===
Farmer competed on the twelfth season of ''America's Got Talent'' in 2017. During the first episode broadcast on May 30, Farmer and her puppet, a girly rabbit named Petunia, performed [[George Gershwin]]'s "[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]".&lt;ref name="agt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDonnell|first1=Brandy|title=Oklahoma ventriloquist Darci Lynne Farmer breaks 'America's Got Talent' records, earns 306 million views on social media|url=https://newsok.com/article/5565102/oklahoma-ventriloquist-darci-lynne-farmer-breaks-americas-got-talent-records-earns-306-million-views-on-social-media|work=[[The Oklahoman|NewsOK]]|date=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comedy–singing act featured Petunia cutting off Farmer so Petunia could continue singing instead. Judge [[Mel B]] praised the act and pressed her Golden Buzzer, allowing Farmer to bypass the [[America's Got Talent#Judge Cuts|judge cuts]] and go straight to the quarterfinals. The video of this performance became the most socially viewed video in the show's history within 30 hours of broadcast,&lt;ref name="agt" /&gt; and was later named {{abbr|No.|Number}} 4 on [[YouTube]]'s list of the top 10 trending videos of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allocca|first=Kevin|url=https://youtube.googleblog.com/2017/12/its-time-for-youtuberewind-celebrating.html|title=It's time for #YouTubeRewind: Celebrating what you watched, shared, and created in 2017|work=Official YouTube Blog|date=6 December 2017|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Farmer's first live presentation after her Golden Buzzer performance, she serenaded [[Mel B]] with her shy, stuttering [[Motown]] mouse puppet, Oscar, performing [[Smokey Robinson]]'s "[[Who's Lovin' You]]".&lt;ref name="agt" /&gt; Judges [[Howie Mandel]], Mel B, [[Heidi Klum]], and [[Simon Cowell]] gave Farmer standing ovations. For this performance, Farmer received enough viewer votes to move on to the semifinals, where she brought her puppet Edna Doorknocker to sing [[Aretha Franklin]]'s "[[(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman]]",&lt;ref name="agt" /&gt; and stood next to the judges' table so Edna could flirt with Simon Cowell. Again, all four judges gave Farmer a standing ovation. Viewers voted Farmer through to the finals.

For her final competition appearance, Farmer performed [[The Beatles]]' "[[With a Little Help from My Friends]]",&lt;ref name="agt" /&gt; with Petunia and Oscar interacting for comedic effect. Again, she earned standing ovations and judges' praise; Cowell predicted, "I think you're going to win."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seemayer|first=Zach|url=http://www.etonline.com/exclusive-darci-lynne-farmer-overcome-joy-after-americas-got-talent-win-talks-prize-money-plans|title=EXCLUSIVE: Darci Lynne Farmer 'Overcome With Joy' After 'America's Got Talent' Win, Talks Prize Money Plans|work=[[Entertainment Tonight]]|date=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the finale in episode 22, Farmer fulfilled her dream by performing "[[Anything You Can Do (song)|Anything You Can Do]]" from ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'' with her idol and mentor [[Terry Fator]], with Farmer singing as Petunia and Fator singing as Winston the Impersonating Turtle. After tripping over the first line of the song, she recovered and the act continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maglio|first=Tony|url=https://www.thewrap.com/darci-lynne-farmer-petunia-terry-fator-video/|title=Watch 'America's Got Talent' Puppet Duel With Darci Lynne, Season 2 Winner Terry Fator (Video)|work=[[TheWrap]]|date=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field was cut to the top five, and then to the top two finalists, Farmer and [[Angelica Hale]]. Host [[Tyra Banks]] then announced Farmer was the winner of the season, having received the most votes out of the 52 million votes&lt;ref name="agt" /&gt; cast. With the win, Farmer received the $1 million prize and a headline gig at [[Planet Hollywood Las Vegas|Planet Hollywood]] in Las Vegas, originally set for November 3 and 4 but two additional shows were added on November 2 and 5 after the first two dates sold out. The Las Vegas shows also featured [[Angelica Hale]], [[Preacher Lawson]] and [[Light Balance]].

'''David Abashidze Stadium''' is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Zestafoni]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. It is used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and is the home stadium of [[FC Zestafoni]]. The stadium is able to hold 4,100 people and opened in 1952.
Zestafoni '''David Abashidze Stadium''' (former Central Stadium) was built by the Zestafoni Ferro-alloy Plant. A couple of matches were held on the stadium before its opening in 1951.
 
In 1952-1989 and 1999-2003 of Georgian Championship team [[FC Metallurg Zestafoni]] held matches on the Zestafoni central stadium, in 1990-1998 it was a home stadium for [[FC Margveti Zestafoni]].

Since 2004, FC Zestafoni has held home matches in the stadium. 

In 1981, reconstruction work was done on the arena; the west stand was roofed and the east stand was constructed. After these works capacity of the stadium increased to 8000 seats.

In 2004, after establishing [[FC Zestafoni]], central stadium was repaired and is still being repaired to renew the arena and comply with international standards.
 
In 2005, works were done to renew the grass surface on the stadium. Georgian workers have constructed new drainage system of German technology. The field is watered with a watering system fromf an American Company “Rainbird”. (This watering system was successfully used on eight stadiums during the 2004 European Championship in Portugal.)

On the Zestafoni central stadium, the field surface, “Natural Green Carpet”, is made by the Ukrainian firm “Lidia-Park”.
 
[[FC Zestafoni]] management plans to build a new base for the club. Lots of new football fields have been constructed in Zestafoni (among them one with an artificial surface). Relevant infrastructure is being made – work out rooms are being repaired, building of new tribunes with personal seats is planned, along with the installment of a modern score-board. 

On 9 April 2010 the Stadium was named after David Abashidze who contributed tremendously to the development and revival of football in Zestafoni.

Capacity of the stadium has been increased to 4 558 individual seats.

"'''Dead Presidents'''" is a 1996 song by [[rapping|rapper]] [[Jay-Z]]. It was released as the first promotional single for Jay-Z's debut album ''[[Reasonable Doubt (album)|Reasonable Doubt]]'', although it did not directly appear on the album: a different version, with the same backing track and chorus but different lyrics, called '''"Dead Presidents II"''', appeared on ''Reasonable Doubt'' instead. The single was a commercial success, and was certified as an [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] [[RIAA certification|certification]] gold single in June 1996. Both versions of the song are regarded as some of the greatest hip-hop songs ever recorded, and "Dead Presidents II" was voted #16 in [[About.com]]'s Top 100 Rap Songs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rap.about.com/od/top10songs/ss/Top100RapSongs_9.htm Top 100 Rap Songs]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Dead Presidents II" also appears in the 2013 video game [[Grand Theft Auto V]] and [[Grand Theft Auto Online]], as part of the Doomsday Heist update, in the blonded Los Santos 97.8 FM radio station.

The title is slang for money because portraits of dead United States presidents appear on most [[Federal Reserve Note]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7106 Dead Presidents Songfacts]&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was produced by [[Ski (producer)|Ski]]. The song [[sampling (music)|samples]] [[Lonnie Liston Smith]]'s "A Garden of Peace" for the track's melody and [[A Tribe Called Quest]]'s "[[Oh My God (A Tribe Called Quest song)|Oh My God (remix)]]" for its percussion; the chorus is a sample of [[Nas]] rapping "I'm out for dead presidents to represent me", from his 1994 song "[[The World Is Yours (Nas song)|The World Is Yours]] ([[Q-Tip (rapper)|Tip]] Mix)".

==Feud with Nas==
[[Nas]] was originally invited to re-rap the chorus for Jay-Z and appear in the track's music video, but he declined. Some view these two actions as the foundation of Jay-Z vs. Nas feud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://escobartheory.blogspot.com/2006_06_01_escobartheory_archive.html Escobartheory.]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Nas and Jay-Z feuded directly, both rappers discussed the merit of the sampling in the song in individual "diss" records. In Nas' track "Stillmatic Freestyle," he says: 
{{quote|You show off, I count dough off when you sample my voice.}}

Jay-Z responds to Nas' claims in his song "[[Takeover (song)|Takeover]]" with the lines: 
{{quote|So yeah, I sampled your voice; you was usin' it wrong: you made it a hot line, I made it a hot song. And you ain't get a coin nigga you was gettin' fucked then; I know who I paid God, [[MC Serch|Serchlite Publishing]].}}

The line was later used in [[Cassidy (rapper)|Cassidy]]'s 2005 hit "[[I'm a Hustla]]": 
{{quote|Yeah I used dude's voice props to the boy Shawn, He made it a hot line, I made it a hot song.}}

In 2005 at Jay-Z's ''I Declare War'' concert, he performed "Dead Presidents II" with Nas, officially ending their feud.

==Production==
In a [[YouTube]] video named ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY8EIoMelFc Ski Beatz - the making of Jay-Z's Dead Presidents]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hhnlive.com/features/more/188 "Roc-A-Biz: Ski Beatz"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111000000/http://www.hhnlive.com/features/more/188 |date=January 11, 2007 }}.  HNNLive.com.  January 7, 2007.  Retrieved June 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ski Beatz|Ski]] explains how he filtered out the high frequency content of the melody sample (using a lowpass filter) to achieve a more prominent bass line without replaying one in. Ski's ''Beats, Rhymes &amp; Samples'' mixtape contains the Q-Tip remix in the context of a "Dead Presidents" sample, because the original "The World is Yours" had altered lyrics in connection to the sampled vocals. At the end of the sample from the chorus, you can hear the "Whose" from "Whose world is this?" from the beginning of the chorus of "The World is Yours".

==Dead Presidents 3==
Jay-Z recorded a track called "Dead Presidents 3" around the time of ''[[The Black Album (Jay-Z album)|The Black Album]]'' but it was never completed. The unfinished song was leaked onto the internet in the fall of 2007, around the release of ''[[American Gangster (album)|American Gangster]]''. In it, Jay-Z referenced some of his lyrics from the original "Dead Presidents" and he used the sample but the sample was played in reverse and had a darker more atmospheric feel to it.

In July 2013 during a rare [[Twitter]] Q&amp;A, a fan asked Jay-Z if "Dead Presidents 3" would be released which then resulted in Jay giving [[Young Guru]] and [[Just Blaze]] the permission to release the track on Young Guru's [[SoundCloud]] account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jay-Z – DP3|url=http://www.indieshuffle.com/jay-z-dp3/|publisher=Indie Shuffle|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remixes==
Many artists have released remixed versions of Dead Presidents with original lyrics (often freestyles) performed over the original sample and chorus.  Notable artists to release versions of Dead Presidents include [[Charles Hamilton (rapper)|Charles Hamilton]], [[Lil B]], [[Lil' Wayne]], [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]], [[Slug of Atmosphere]], [[Chamillionaire]], [[J. Cole]], Logic, [[Kendrick Lamar]], [[Pusha T]], [[Akala (rapper)|Akala]], [[Lupe Fiasco]], [[Kano (rapper)|Kano]], [[Logic (rapper)|Logic]], [[Slaughterhouse]], [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]], [[Curren$y]] featuring and [[DJ Premier]] who recorded a version with reworked instrumentals with [[Jay-Z]]'s original lyrics and vocals from [[Nas]]' [[The World Is Yours (Nas song)|The World is Yours]] (Remix).

==History==
The company was founded in 1999 and was headquartered in San Francisco, California.&lt;ref name="businessweek-coinfo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vt312" /&gt;

Ecast merged with [[RioPort]] in October 2002.&lt;ref name="RioPort Ecast Merger"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2002/10/14/daily39.html |title=RioPort agrees to merge with Ecast, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rioport was a digital music download service precursor to [[iTunes]] and was the first service to sign digital download agreements with all 5 of the major music labels.

Ecast, Inc. ceased operations when it closed its Jukebox network on March 1, 2012. The company's board of directors voted for an immediate shutdown after the company failed to raise enough capital to continue operating. Ecast's phones and email were turned off shortly after. AMI Entertainment Network Inc. and TouchTunes Interactive Networks indicated they would accommodate customers no longer able to access the company's services.&lt;ref name="vt312" /&gt;

==Controversies==

===TouchTunes patent dispute===
In late 2001, Ecast filed a lawsuit against TouchTunes Music Corporation claiming the company resorted to unfair trade practices by notifying Ecast and its customers that they were infringing TouchTunes' patent.&lt;ref name="law360404"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.law360.com/articles/1382/touchtunes-and-ecast-settle-patent-disputes | title=TouchTunes and Ecast Settle Patent Disputes | work=Law360 | date=April 29, 2004 | accessdate=July 17, 2013 | author=Meland, Marius | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 2003, Ecast voluntarily dismissed its own claims against TouchTunes for interference with contracts and unfair competition. In January 2004, TouchTunes filed a counterclaim that Ecast infringed on their patent rights by incorporating Touchtunes’ technology into their systems.&lt;ref name="law360404" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ttcounterpr"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/touchtunes-counterclaims-against-ecast-and-rock-ola-for-patent-infringement-58950327.html | title=TouchTunes Counterclaims Against Ecast and Rock-Ola for Patent Infringement | publisher=PRNewswire-FirstCall | date=January 13, 2004 | accessdate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecast also had a separate patent infringement case against TouchTunes, charging the company with infringement by selling its jukeboxes within the U.S.&lt;ref name="law360404" /&gt;

Ultimately TouchTunes and Ecast agreed to cross-license TouchTunes' U.S. Patent No. 6,308,204 and Ecast's U.S. Patent No. 5,341,350, which it licensed from NSM Music Group Limited.&lt;ref name="law360404" /&gt;

===Civil antitrust action===
In September 2005, the Attorney General of the United States filed a civil antitrust action against Ecast, Inc. and NSM Music Group, Ltd.  The lawsuit alleged that a February 2003 agreement between the companies agreement was in violation of Section 1 of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].  Specifically that the negotiations which eventually led to NSM Music Group manufacturing Ecast's hardware, after their previous manufacturer terminated the supply agreement, included an agreement by NSM to abandon its plans to enter the U.S. market in return for an upfront payment by Ecast.  The Attorney General contended that NSM's agreement caused them to abandon their plan to incorporate their own distinctive digital jukebox platform into their physical jukeboxes and enter the United States market.&lt;ref name="usvec905"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=U.S. v. Ecast, Inc. and NSM Music Group, Ltd.|vol=|reporter= |opinion=|pinpoint=|court= D.D.C. |date=September 2, 2005 |url=http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f210900/210960.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Justice simultaneously announced alongside the lawsuit that it had reached a settlement with NSM and Ecast under which the two companies terminated their non-compete agreement.&lt;ref name="tlj1209"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.techlawjournal.com/alert/2005/09/08.asp | title=TLJ Daily E-Mail Alert No. 1,209 | publisher=Tech Law Journal | date=September 8, 2005 | accessdate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Ecast co-founder and one-time [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] and Executive Chairman, [[Samuel "Mouli" Cohen]] defrauded 55 investors, including actor [[Danny Glover]] and the [[Vanguard Public Foundation]], of more than $28 million and two lawsuits were filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lawsuit says ex-Marin executive defrauded investors|url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/ci_12756377|accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen told investors that Ecast, Inc. was about to be acquired by [[Microsoft]].

The '''Entertainment Software Rating Board''' ('''ESRB''') is an American [[self-regulatory organization]] that assigns [[Video game content rating system|age and content ratings]] to consumer [[video game]]s. The ESRB was established in 1994 by the [[Entertainment Software Association]] (formerly the Interactive Digital Software Association), in response to criticism of [[video game controversy|controversial video games]] with excessively violent or [[Sex and nudity in video games|sexual content]].

The board assigns [[Content rating|ratings]] to games based on their content, using judgment similar to the [[motion picture rating system]]s used in many countries, using a combination of six age-based levels intended to aid consumers in determining a game's content and suitability, along with a system of "content descriptors" which detail specific types of content present in a particular game. The ESRB maintains a [[ethics code|code of ethics]] for the advertising and promotion of video games—ensuring that marketing materials for games are targeted to appropriate audiences. In 2011, the ESRB began offering a system to automatically assign ratings for digitally-distributed games and [[mobile app]]s, which utilizes a survey answered by the product's publisher as opposed to a manual assessment by ESRB staff. Through the [[International Age Rating Coalition]] (IARC), this method can generate equivalent ratings for other territories. Alongside its game rating operation, the ESRB also provides certification services for [[online privacy]] on websites and mobile apps.

The ESRB ratings system is enforced via the voluntary leverage of the North American [[video game industry|video game]] and retail industries; most stores require customers to present photo identification when purchasing games carrying the ESRB's highest age ratings, and do not stock games which have not been rated. Additionally, major [[console manufacturer]]s will not license games for their systems unless they carry ESRB ratings, while console manufacturers and most stores will refuse games that the ESRB has rated as being appropriate for adults only. The ESRB ratings system is not enforced under federal laws in any of the countries where it is actively used, although it is enforced under provincial laws in some regions of Canada.

Due to the level of consumer and retail awareness of the ratings system, along with the organization's efforts to ensure that retailers comply with the ratings system and that publishers comply with its marketing code, the ESRB has considered its system to be effective, and was praised by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] for being the "strongest" self-regulatory organization in the entertainment sector. Despite its positive reception, the ESRB has still faced criticism from politicians and other [[watchdog group]]s for the structure of its operations, particularly in the wake of a 2005 [[Hot Coffee mod|incident]] that surrounded the organization's handling of "hidden", objectionable content in a [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas|game]] which could be accessed using a [[Game mod|user-created modification]].

Critics of the ESRB have asserted that the organization has a [[conflict of interest]] because of its [[Vested interest (communication theory)|vested interest]] in the video game industry, and that the ESRB does not rate certain games, such as the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]], harshly enough for their violent or sexual content in order to protect their commercial viability. Contrarily, other critics have argued that, at the same time, the ESRB rates certain games too strongly for their content, and that its influence has stifled the viability of adult-oriented video games due to the board's restrictions on how they are marketed and sold.

== History ==

===Background===
Video games with objectionable content date back as far as 1976; the arcade game ''[[Death Race (video game)|Death Race]]'' required users to run over "[[gremlin]]s" with a vehicle and avoid the [[gravestone]]s they leave behind. Although its graphics were relatively primitive, the game's overall theme and the sound effects made when gremlins were killed were considered disturbing by players, prompting media attention.&lt;ref name="sn-controversal"/&gt; A developer known as [[Mystique (company)|Mystique]] became known for making sexually explicit [[adult video game]]s for the [[Atari 2600]] console, but garnered the most attention with its controversial 1982 game ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'', which infamously featured a crude simulation of the [[rape]] of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] woman. [[Atari]] received numerous complaints about the game, and responded by trying to sue the game's makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.gamespy.com/top10/december02/shame/index4.shtml | title=Gamespy's Top Ten Shameful Games | publisher=IGN Entertainment | work=GameSpy | accessdate=November 17, 2013 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426012823/http://archive.gamespy.com/top10/december02/shame/index4.shtml | archivedate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Phoenix: The Fall &amp; Rise of Video Games | last=Herman | first=Leonard | year=1997 | page=88 | isbn=0964384825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[North American video game crash of 1983|1983 industry crash]], caused by the market being overrun with low-quality products, prompted a higher degree of [[Closed platform|regulation]] by future console manufacturers: when the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) was launched in the [[United States]] in 1985, [[Nintendo of America]] instituted requirements and restrictions on third-party developers, including the requirement for all games to be licensed by the company. The console itself also included a [[10NES|lockout chip]] to enforce this requirement and prevent the console from loading unlicensed games. Such leverage on developers has since become a standard practice among console makers, although Nintendo of America also had stringent content policies, frequently censoring blood, sexual content, and references to religion, tobacco and alcohol from games released on its consoles in the United States.&lt;ref name="gamesradar-nintendobanned"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nintendo: Banned in the USA|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/nintendo-banned-in-the-usa/|work=GamesRadar|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-lying1m"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/06/7076-2/ | title=ESRB to game firms: lying will cost one million dollars | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked in 1987 about the suitability of a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|film-like rating system]] for video games, a representative of the [[Software Publishers Association]] said that "Adult computer software is nothing to worry about. It's not an issue that the government wants to spend any time with ... They just got done with [[Parents Music Resource Center|a big witchhunt in the music recording industry]], and they got absolutely nowhere". The association did recommend voluntary warnings for games like ''[[Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards]]'' (1987).&lt;ref name="CGW"&gt;{{Cite magazine|date= January 1988|last=Williams|first=John|magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]]|title=Goodbye "G" Ratings: The Perils of "Larry"|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1988&amp;pub=2&amp;id=43 |pages = 48–49|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation and early years ===
Video games' progression into the 1990s brought dramatic increases in graphics and sound capabilities, and the ability to use [[full-motion video]] (FMV) content in games. In the [[United States Senate]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senators [[Joe Lieberman]] of [[Connecticut]] and [[Herb Kohl]] of [[Wisconsin]] led [[1993 Congressional hearings on video games|hearings on video game violence]] and the corruption of society which began in 1992. Two games of this era were specifically cited in the hearings for their content; the [[fighting game]] ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' featured realistic, digitized sprites of live-action actors, blood, and the ability to use violent "[[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|fatality]]" moves to defeat opponents, while ''[[Night Trap]]'' featured 90 minutes of FMV content, with scenes that were considered to be sexually suggestive and [[Sexual exploitation|exploitive]].&lt;ref name="sn-controversal"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rogues Gallery: Controversial Video Games|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/38876/the-rogues-gallery-controversial-video|work=ShackNews|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="escapist-esrb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inappropriate Content: A Brief History of Videogame Ratings and the ESRB|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/the-needles/1300-Inappropriate-Content-A-Brief-History-of-Videogame-Ratings-and-the-ESRB|work=The Escapist|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both [[Nintendo]] and [[Sega]] had differing views on objectionable content in video games; a port of ''Mortal Kombat'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] was censored to remove the game's overly violent content, whereas the port for Sega consoles retained much of this content, which helped increase sales.&lt;ref name="gamesradar-nintendobanned"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ign-worstcoinop"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2006/06/28/top-10-tuesday-worst-coin-op-conversions | title=Top 10 Tuesday: Worst Coin-op Conversions | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=June 27, 2006 | accessdate=March 18, 2014 | last=Harris | first=Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sega had implemented its own voluntary ratings system, the [[Videogame Rating Council]] (VRC), largely to rate games released for its own consoles. ''Mortal Kombat'' and ''Night Trap'' were rated "MA-13" and "MA-17" on Sega's scale respectively. During the hearings, [[Howard Lincoln]] and Bill White (chairmen of Nintendo and Sega's U.S. divisions respectively) attacked each other's stances on objectionable content in video games; Lincoln condemned Sega for even releasing ''Night Trap'' and felt it "simply has no place in our society", while White argued that Sega was more responsible to consumers because they actually had a rating system in place, rather than a blanket presumption that all its games would be suitable for general audiences.&lt;ref name="Wired-kohler-chris-2009-07-29"/&gt; Fragmentation would also develop in the classification of games; [[The 3DO Company]] created their own age-based rating system, the [[3DO Rating System]], for games released on its [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] platform, and the [[Recreational Software Advisory Council]] (RSAC) was formed for rating PC games, which used a system that rated the intensity of specific classes of objectionable content, but did not use age recommendations. However, Lieberman did not believe that these systems were sufficient, and in February 1994, threatened to propose the creation of a federal commission for regulating and rating video games.&lt;ref name="escapist-esrb"/&gt;

With the threat of federal regulations, a group of major video game developers and publishers, including [[Acclaim Entertainment]] and [[Electronic Arts]] along with Nintendo and Sega, formed a political trade group known as the [[Entertainment Software Association|Interactive Digital Software Association]] in April 1994, with a goal to create a self-regulatory framework for assessing and rating video games. While Sega had proposed that the industry use its VRC rating system, Nintendo representatives objected to the idea because they did not want to associate themselves with the work of their main competitor; instead, a vendor-neutral rating system known as the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) was developed. The formation of the ESRB was officially announced to Congress on July 29, 1994. The ESRB was officially launched on September 16, 1994; its system consisted of five age-based ratings; "Early Childhood", "Kids to Adults" (later renamed "Everyone" in 1998), "Teen", "Mature", and "Adults Only". The ESRB would also use "descriptors" with brief explanations of the content contained in a game.&lt;ref name="Wired-kohler-chris-2009-07-29"&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Kohler |title=July 29, 1994: Videogame Makers Propose Ratings Board to Congress |date=July 29, 2009 |work=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' |url=https://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2009/07/dayintech_0729/ |publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]] |accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esrb.org/about/news.aspx|title=Press releases and announcements from ESRB|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. arcade gaming industry did not adopt the ESRB system, with the American Amusement Machine Association (AAMA) having cited "fundamental differences between the coin-operated and consumer segments of the video game industry" as reasoning. The AAMA, the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association, and the International Association for the Leisure and Entertainment Industry, adopted their own three-tier "Parental Advisory System" in 1994, which uses three color-coded levels of content intensity (designated by green, yellow, and red stickers affixed to arcade cabinet artwork).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://coin-op.org/pas-frequently-asked-questions/|title=PAS - Frequently Asked Questions|work=AAMA - American Amusement Machine Association|access-date=2017-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/theater-group-to-impose-ratings-on-arcade-games/1100-6075491/|title=Theater group to impose ratings on arcade games|last=Layton|first=Thomas|date=2003-09-19|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion and recent developments ===
Alongside its efforts to classify video games, the ESRB also formed a division known as Entertainment Software Rating Board Interactive (ESRBi), which rated internet content using a similar system to its video game ratings. ESRBi also notably partnered with the [[internet service provider]] [[America Online]] to integrate these ratings into its existing [[parental controls]].&lt;ref name="escapist-esrb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vchip-debate"&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Monroe E.|title=The V-chip debate: content filtering from television to the Internet|year=1998|isbn=1136684328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="copa-speech"&gt;{{cite web|title=TESTIMONY OF DR. ARTHUR POBER PRESIDENT OF THE ENTERTAINMENT SOFTWARE RATING BOARD BEFORE THE COMMISSION ON CHILD ONLINE PROTECTION|url=http://www.copacommission.org/meetings/hearing2/pober.test.pdf|publisher=Commission on Child Online Protection|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESRBi was discontinued in 2003.&lt;ref name="esrb-timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB History|url=http://www.esrb.org/about/chronology.jsp|publisher=ESRB|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Dr. Arthur Pober, the original president of the ESRB, stepped down so he could focus on academics. In November 2002, he was formally replaced by Patrica Vance, who formerly worked for [[The Princeton Review]] and [[The Walt Disney Company]].&lt;ref name="lat-strategy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Strategy for Parents: Use Ratings, Be Informed|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/26/news/tt-42068|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=April 13, 2014|first=Jinny|last=Gudmundsen|date=October 26, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-newpresident"&gt;{{cite web|title=New President Named To ESRB|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/92492/New_President_Named_To_ESRB.php|work=Gamasutra|publisher=UBM plc|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005, the ESRB introduced a new rating, "Everyone 10+", designating games with content of a relatively higher impact than those of games rated "Everyone", but still not high enough to garner a "Teen" rating.&lt;ref name="ftc-ratings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ign-e10plus"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB Introduces E10+ Game Rating|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2005/03/02/esrb-introduces-e10-game-rating|work=IGN|publisher=IGN Entertainment|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the growth of [[smartphone]] use, in November 2011, [[CTIA – The Wireless Association|CTIA]], a group of major U.S. companies representing the wireless industry, and ESRB announced the co-development of a free, voluntary ratings process for [[Mobile app|mobile]] [[app store]]s. The system uses ESRB's icons and content descriptors, along with four additional "Interactive Elements" ("Digital Purchases", "Shares Info," "Shares Location," and "Users Interact") to inform users of an app's behavior in regards to data collection and interactions with others. [[Verizon Wireless]] and [[T-Mobile US]] were among the first to implement the system for their own application storefronts, and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Phone Store|Windows Phone Marketplace]] already supported ESRB ratings upon its introduction.&lt;ref name="cnet-kneecap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ctia-appratings"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB, CTIA Detail Voluntary Mobile App Rating System|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/128390/ESRB_CTIA_Detail_Voluntary_Mobile_App_Rating_System.php|work=Gamasutra|publisher=UBM plc|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku-esrblootboxes"/&gt; ESRB president Patricia Vance explained that the partnership was intended to help broaden the ESRB's reach into the mobile market, and that "consumers, especially parents, benefit from having a consistently applied set of ratings for games rather than a fragmented array of different systems."&lt;ref name="poylgon-iconupdate"/&gt;

In November 2012, the ESRB and other video game ratings boards, including [[PEGI]], the [[Australian Classification Board]], and [[USK]] among others, established a consortium known as the [[International Age Rating Coalition]] (IARC). The group sought to design an online, questionnaire-based rating process for digitally-distributed video games that could generate ratings for multiple video game ratings organizations at once. The resulting ratings information is tied to a unique code, which can then be used by online storefronts to display the corresponding rating for the user's region.&lt;ref name="ign-ausiarc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Getting Digitally-Distributed Games Classified in Australia to Be Cost-Free|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2014/09/01/getting-digitally-distributed-games-classified-in-australia-to-be-cost-free|website=IGN.com|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-consistency"&gt;{{cite news|title=Game Makers Push to Make Ratings Consistent Across All Platforms|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324595904578117484171808510|accessdate=March 17, 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three major console makers, Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have all committed to supporting IARC for their digital storefronts, including ESRB ratings for North American markets.&lt;ref name="gibiz iarc consoles"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-03-17-esrb-expanding-to-mobile-digital-platforms | title = ESRB expanding to mobile, digital platforms | first = James | last = Brightman | date = March 17, 2015 | accessdate = November 27, 2017 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google Play Store]] was updated in March 2015 to adopt and display ESRB ratings for apps in North America through IARC.&lt;ref name="verge-googleplayesrb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Play adopts industry standard for age ratings on mobile games|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8231207/google-play-esrb-iarc-game-ratings|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Windows Store]] also implemented IARC in January 2016.&lt;ref name="gibiz-iarcwindows"&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows Store adopts IARC rating system|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-01-07-windows-store-adopts-iarc-rating-system|website=GamesIndustry.biz|accessdate=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iOS App Store|App Store]] still uses its own generic age rating system and does not use the ESRB or IARC systems.&lt;ref name="cnet-kneecap"&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple, Google kneecap 'universal' content rating for apps|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57332972-94/apple-google-kneecap-universal-content-rating-for-apps/|work=CNET|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tc-ctiaapps"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/29/ctia-and-esrb-debuts-app-rating-system-no-buy-in-from-google-or-apple/ | title=CTIA And ESRB Debut App Rating System, No Buy-In From Google Or Apple | publisher=[[AOL]] | work=TechCrunch | accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rating process==
To obtain a rating for a game, a publisher submits a detailed questionnaire and a DVD containing footage of the most graphic and extreme content found in the game to the ESRB, including content related to the game's context, storyline, reward system, unlockable and otherwise "hidden" content, and other elements that may affect its rating. They may also provide printed copies of the game's script and lyrics from songs in the game. The footage is reviewed by a team of at least three raters, who discuss what the most appropriate and "helpful" rating for the game would be, based on the footage and details provided. Raters represent various demographics, including parents, along with [[Gamer|casual and "hardcore" gamers]]. Raters were formerly hired on a part-time basis, but in 2007, ESRB transitioned to a team of seven full-time raters, who all live in the [[New York City]] area.&lt;ref name="ars-lying1m" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gs-fulltime"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/esrb-hiring-full-time-raters/1100-6166197/ | title=ESRB hiring full-time raters | publisher=[[CNET Networks]] | work=GameSpot | accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gi-ratingsgame"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-notyetrated"&gt;{{cite web|title=This Game Is Not Yet Rated: Inside The ESRB Ratings System|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130387/this_game_is_not_yet_rated_inside_.php?|work=[[Gamasutra]]|publisher=[[UBM plc]]|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-changes"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2005/09/5311-2/ | title=ESRB makes changes in wake of Hot Coffee | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esrb-faq"/&gt;

If a publisher does not agree with the rating that they were assigned, they may edit the game and submit the revised version for a new rating; for example, an initial cut of ''[[The Punisher (2005 video game)|The Punisher]]'' was given an AO rating due to the extremely violent nature of certain scenes contained within the game. To lessen their impact, the developer changed these scenes to be rendered in black and white: the revised cut of the game was re-submitted, and received the M rating.&lt;ref name="polygon-aoartform"/&gt; There is also an appeals process, but it has never been used.&lt;ref name="gamasutra-notyetrated"/&gt;

When the game is ready for release, the publisher sends copies of the final version of the game to the ESRB, who reviews the game's packaging, and a random number of games they receive are [[Game testing|play tested]] for more thorough review. Penalties apply to publishers who misrepresent the content of their games, including the potential for fines up to US $1 million and a product recall, if deemed necessary.&lt;ref name="ars-lying1m" /&gt;&lt;ref name="esrb-faq"&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQs about ESRB|url=http://www.esrb.org/ratings/faq.jsp|publisher=ESRB|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ESRB typically posts rating information for new titles on its website 30 days after the rating process is complete; in 2008, in response to incidents where this practice inadvertently leaked information about games that had not yet been announced, the ESRB began to allow publishers to place [[news embargo|embargoes]] on the release of ratings information until a game is officially announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/esrb-reins-premature-game-leaks/ | title=ESRB Reins In Premature Game Leaks | publisher=Future Publishing | work=Edge | date=June 19, 2008 | accessdate=March 18, 2014 | last=Graft | first=Kris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the ESRB introduced its Short Form, a free streamlined, automated process for assigning ratings for console downloadable games as a way to address the rapidly growing volume of digitally-delivered games. Rather than having raters review each product (the Long Form), publishers of these games complete a series of multiple-choice questions that address content across relevant categories, including violence, sexual content, language, etc. The responses automatically determine the game's rating category and content descriptors. Games rated via this process may be tested post-release to ensure that content was properly disclosed. The survey-based method is also used in the ESRB/CTIA and IARC rating programs for [[mobile app]]s.&lt;ref name="ctia-appratings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-googleplayesrb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-busyjob"&gt;{{cite news|title=Busy Job of Judging Video-Game Content to Be Ceded to Machines|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/arts/video-games/video-games-rating-board-questionnaire.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=March 19, 2014|first=Seth|last=Schiesel|date=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ESRB planned to phase out the Short Form for digital-only games, instead directing those developers and publishers to use the similar free questionnaire-driven IARC program, which was being adopted beyond mobile app stores, including the Nintendo eShop and PlayStation Store, as a requirement for posting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamesinsider.biz/news/67069/esrb-confirms-digital-games-will-still-get-free-ratings/ | title = ESRB confirms digital games will still get free ratings | first = Natalie | last = Clayton | date = May 18, 2018 | accessdate = May 18, 2018 | work = [[PC Games Insider]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to concerns from Sony on the growing number of indie game titles that were receiving physical releases alongside retail ones, the ESRB began instituting new rules around August 2017 that any retail product was mandated to undergo the standard Long Form review for the game, disallowing the use of the Short Form for such titles. Alongside this, ESRB introduced a "value tier" for the Long Form review process for games developed at lower budgets (under $1 million), with a cost of $3000 for obtaining the retail rating. This decision has impacted the choice of several boutique indie game publishers, who have either cancelled plans for retail versions or had to stop selling retail versions to comply with the new ESRB rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/new-rating-requirement-makes-life-harder-for-smaller-ga-1820296023 | title = New Rating Requirement Makes Life Harder For Smaller Game Publishers | first= Ethan | last= Gach | date = November 9, 2017 | accessdate = November 10, 2017 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ratings==

[[File:ESRBrating.PNG|thumb|right|160px|A typical ESRB rating label, listing the rating and specific content descriptors for ''[[Rabbids Go Home]]''.]]

ESRB ratings are primarily identified through icons, which are displayed on the packaging and promotional materials for a game. Each icon contains a stylized alphabetical letter representing the rating.  In addition to the main age-based, ratings, ESRB ratings also incorporate one or more of 30 "content descriptors" which provide detailed information about the specific types and levels of objectionable content contained in a game, including categories covering different levels of [[violence]], language, [[Sex and nudity in video games|sexual content]], [[Sex and nudity in video games|nudity]], use of [[alcoholic beverage]]s or other [[drug]]s, crude and mature humor, or [[gambling]]. The full label, containing both the descriptors and rating, are typically displayed on the back of a game's packaging.&lt;ref name="ftc-ratings"/&gt;

Games which incorporate [[online game|online]] features must display the additional notice "Online Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB" (previously "Game Experience May Change During Online Play"), which disclaims that the rating only applies to the content contained within the game itself, and does not cover any [[user-generated content]] available within.&lt;ref name="escapist-op"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obsolescence Pending: Rating the ESRB|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/issues/issue_223/6647-Obsolescence-Pending-Rating-the-ESRB|accessdate=July 22, 2014|work=The Escapist|date=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="escapist-didnotbreak"&gt;{{cite web|title="Boobies Did Not Break the Game": The ESRB Clears the Air On Oblivion|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/op-ed/797-Boobies-Did-Not-Break-the-Game-The-ESRB-Clears-the-Air-On-Oblivi|website=The Escapist|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games that provide post-release [[downloadable content]] must have ensure that the new content remains consistent with the original ESRB rating; otherwise the ESRB requires that the original game be re-evaluated and remarked with the more appropriate rating in considering this new content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2008/04/esrb-dlc-must-m/ | title = ESRB: Downloadable Content Must Maintain Original Rating | first = Earnest | last = Cavalli | date = April 17, 2008  | accessdate = November 27, 2017 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratings information also disclaims if a game offers digital goods or other premiums (including downloadable content, [[microtransaction]]s, and "[[loot boxes]]") that require payment of real money to obtain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/new-video-game-label-will-be-required-for-in-game-purchases/|title=ESRB mandating new label for games with microtransactions|date=2018-02-27|work=CNET|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance of the ratings icons themselves have been updated several times; originally carrying a stylized, pixelated look, they were first updated in 1999 to carry a cleaner appearance. In August 2013, the rating icons were streamlined again; the textual name of the rating became black text on white, the "content rated by" tagline was removed, and [[registered trademark symbol]]s were moved to the bottom-right corner. The changes were intended to increase the icons' clarity at smaller sizes (such as on mobile devices), reflecting the growth in the digital distribution of video games.&lt;ref name="poylgon-iconupdate"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/2/4580328/esrb-tweaks-rating-icons-digital-mobile-future-patricia-vance-interview | title=ESRB tweaks rating icons for digital and mobile future | publisher=[[Vox Media]] | work=Polygon | accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==
The ESRB rating system is primarily enforced on a [[Self-regulatory organization|self-regulatory]] basis by the [[Video game industry|video game]] and [[Retail industry|retail industries]]; in markets where it is used, retailers typically enforce the "Mature" rating using [[photo identification]], and refuse to stock video games that have not been rated by the organization, or are rated "Adults Only".&lt;ref name="ars-housebill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-ftcratings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-esrblaw"/&gt; Modern [[video game console]]s may also include [[parental controls]] that can be configured to restrict games played by specific users, using factors such as their ESRB rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0270-kids-parents-and-video-games#controls|title=Kids, Parents, and Video Games|date=2012-06-26|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/video-games-how-to-setup-parental-controls-version-1431990207/|title=Gaming with guidance: How to set up parental controls on modern consoles, handhelds, and computers|date=2017-05-09|work=Digital Trends|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ESRB has also taken action against video game distributors who use the ratings icons in advertising without authorization or having actually been issued the rating by the board.&lt;ref name="gibiz-wartune"/&gt;

[[Steam (software)|Steam]], the largest digital distribution storefront for personal computers, does display ratings when available, and allows games to be categorized and filtered based on categories, but an ESRB rating is not mandatory. As of June 2018, following complaints regarding inconsistent enforcement of its previous guidelines, Steam only bans the sale of games that contain blatantly illegal content, or games that it classifies as being "straight up [[trolling]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/31/16570552/steam-adult-games-uncensored-patches|title=Steam blocking adult game developers from sharing uncensored patches|work=Polygon|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gibiz iarc consoles"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/361305/steam-threatens-to-remove-anime-style-adult-games|title=Steam Threatens to Remove Anime-Style Adult Games|work=PC Magazine|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/active-shooter-game-steam-1202822402/|title=Valve Criticized Over ‘Appalling’ School Shooting Game on Steam|last=Fogel|first=Stefanie|date=2018-05-25|work=Variety|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/the-sex-games-that-steam-censors-1680718912|title=The Sex Games That Steam Censors|last=Hernandez|first=Patricia|work=Kotaku|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, there have been attempts at the state and federal level to introduce laws requiring retailers to enforce the ESRB ratings system. In 2004, California Assemblyman [[Leland Yee]] sponsored a state bill requiring retailers to stock M-rated games on separate shelves that are at least {{convert|5|ft|in}} from the ground. The bill was passed, after it was modified to only require that retailers promote awareness of the ESRB ratings system to their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=4324 | title = Schwarzenegger Signs California Video Games Bill | work = [[Gamasutra]] |publisher=UBM plc | date = September 22, 2004 | accessdate=  November 2, 2010 | first =David | last = Jenkins | first2= Simon | last2= Carless }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, California passed AB 1179, a second bill sponsored by Yee, which banned the sale of "violent video games" to minors. The term was defined using a variation of the [[Miller test]] (originally created to judge whether a work is [[obscenity|obscene]]), separate from any rating the game may have received. In a landmark ruling, the law was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association]]'', which ruled that AB 1179 was unconstitutional because video games are a [[Freedom of the press|protected form of expression]].&lt;ref name="ars-housebill"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/01/house-bill-wants-5000-fine-for-video-games-without-esrb-rating/ | title=House bill wants $5,000 fine for video games without ESRB rating | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-ftcratings"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/05/ftc-report-retailers-clamping-down-on-m-rated-game-sales/ | title=FTC report: retailers clamping down on M-rated game sales | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-esrblaw"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/05/id-please-bill-would-mandate-carding-for-m-rated-game-buys/ | title=ID, please: Bill would mandate carding for M-rated game buys | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra analysis"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6191/video_game_regulation_and_the_.php | title = Video Game Regulation and the Supreme Court: Schwarzenegger v.

In [[Canada]], ESRB ratings are enforced under provincial laws by film ratings boards in [[Manitoba]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Ontario]], and [[Saskatchewan]]. As in the U.S., most retailers voluntarily enforce the ratings regardless.&lt;ref name="manitoba-esrb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Video and Computer Game Update|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/mfcb/pdf/game_update.pdf|work=[[Manitoba Film Classification Board]]|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ofrb-videogames"&gt;{{cite web|title=Video and Computer Games|url=http://www.ofrb.gov.on.ca/english/page15.htm|work=[[Ontario Film Review Board]]|accessdate=March 18, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208132646/http://www.ofrb.gov.on.ca/english/page15.htm|archivedate=February 8, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vsun-california"&gt;{{cite web|title=California seeks gaming age limits|url=http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=09f7b9c0-f538-495c-97df-5bbfd8faadee&amp;sponsor=|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140318212437/http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=09f7b9c0-f538-495c-97df-5bbfd8faadee&amp;sponsor=|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 18, 2014|work=[[Vancouver Sun]]|publisher=[[Postmedia Network]]|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the implementation of the [[Film Classification Act, 2005]], which gave it the power to enforce ESRB ratings, the [[Ontario Film Review Board]] had used its own powers to classify the M-rated ''[[Manhunt (video game)|Manhunt]]'' as a film and give it a [[Canadian motion picture rating system|"Restricted" rating]], legally barring its sale to those under 18. By contrast, the [[British Columbia Film Classification Office]] considered the ESRB rating to be appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bcfilmclass.com/decisions/2004/manhunt.pdf | title=Opinion Review: In the Matter of Manhunt published by Rockstar Games | date=February 6, 2004 | publisher=[[British Columbia Film Classification Office]] | accessdate=October 12, 2006 | format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060214090109/http://bcfilmclass.com/decisions/2004/manhunt.pdf |archivedate=February 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc-rrated"/&gt;

== Marketing ==
The ESRB enforces guidelines that have been adopted by the video game industry in order to ensure responsible advertising and marketing practices. These include ensuring that game packaging, advertisements, and trailers properly display rating information, restricting where advertising materials for games rated "Teen" or higher can appear, forbidding publishers from "glamoriz[ing] or exploiting" a game's rating in advertising, and requiring online marketing of games rated "Mature" or higher to be restricted to users who are [[Age gate|appropriately aged]].&lt;ref name="gibiz-wartune"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wartune advertising runs afoul of ESRB|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-05-10-wartune-advertising-runs-afoul-of-esrb|website=GamesIndustry.biz|accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esrb-enforcement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Enforcement|url=http://www.esrb.org/ratings/enforcement.jsp|publisher=ESRB|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the ESRB to restrict video game advertising "to consumers for whom the product is not rated as appropriate."&lt;ref name="esrb-principles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles and Guidelines for Responsible Advertising Practices|url=https://www.esrb.org/ratings/principles_guidlines.jsp|publisher=ESRB|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board also forbids ratings from other organizations from being shown alongside ESRB ratings on publishers' websites or social media outlets.&lt;ref name="gb-esrbtraliers"/&gt; A group of online gaming publications known as the ESRB Website Council operates under a similar code of conduct, which requires them to display ESRB ratings information for games that they cover, and implement systems to restrict access to audiovisual content depicting M or AO-rated games to users who are appropriately aged.&lt;ref name="esrb-ewccode"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB Website Council "Code of Conduct" |url=http://www.esrb.org/ratings/downloads/ewc_code.pdf |publisher=ESRB |accessdate=March 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824172525/http://www.esrb.org/ratings/downloads/ewc_code.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, the ESRB eased certain restrictions on the promotion of M-rated games. Firstly, trailers for games that are or are anticipated to be rated "Mature" can be cleared by the ESRB as being appropriate for "general" audiences—similarly to the [[MPAA rating system#Advertising materials|"green band"]] ratings issued by the MPAA for film trailers. Secondly, the board began to allow, on a case-by-case basis depending on the target demographic of the game, M-rated games to be [[cross-promotion|cross-promoted]] in the marketing materials of games with lower ratings.&lt;ref name="gb-esrbtraliers"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB Changes Rules for Marketing Mature-Rated Video Games|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/articles/esrb-changes-rules-for-marketing-mature-rated-vide/1100-4602/|website=Giant Bomb|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online privacy ==
In addition to its video game ratings operation, the ESRB also offers an [[online privacy]] program which helps websites adopt [[privacy policy|privacy policies]] and data usage practices which comply with relevant laws and best practices for the collection and use of personal information, and provides "Privacy Certified" seals indicating certification under the ESRB's privacy guidelines. In June 2013, the service was extended to mobile apps, with a particular emphasis on helping application developers comply with the then-upcoming changes to the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]].&lt;ref name="ars-esrbprivacy"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB’s privacy badge all about best practices, not anonymity|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/07/esrbs-privacy-badge-all-about-best-practices-not-anonymity/|work=Ars Technica|publisher=Condé Nast Publications|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon-privacycertification"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB will extend privacy certification services to mobile developers|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/26/4466196/esrb-will-extend-privacy-certification-services-to-mobile-developers|work=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="venturebeat-esrbprivacy"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB expands its ‘Privacy Certified’ services for mobile apps|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/06/25/esrb-expands-its-privacy-certified-services-for-mobile-apps/|work=VentureBeat|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The ESRB has considered its system to be effective, due in part to initiatives by the Board to promote enforcement and consumer awareness of the system, and efforts by retailers to prevent the sale of M-rated games to minors.&lt;ref name="escapist-esrb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-decry"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB, game retailers decry "bad report card"|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2005/12/5665-2/|work=Ars Technica|publisher=Condé Nast Publications|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year following its 1994 launch, the ESRB rating system had achieved widespread usage across the console game industry, although adoption was not yet as high within the PC gaming industry. Lieberman and Kohl also reported that some retailers were reluctant to the idea of removing older, non-rated games from their shelves, and that some retail employees lacked knowledge of the new system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=One Year Later, Is Senator Lieberman Satisfied?|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] reported 20% of underaged [[mystery shopper]]s were able to successfully purchase an M-rated video game from a selection of retailers—a 22 percent reduction from 2007.&lt;ref name="ars-ftcratings" /&gt; By 2011, these numbers had dropped further to 13%.&lt;ref name="ars-ftc2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=FTC: kids thwarted 87% of the time on M-rated game purchases|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/04/ftc-kids-thwarted-87-of-the-time-on-m-rated-game-purchases/|work=Ars Technica|publisher=Condé Nast Publications|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2009 Report to [[United States Congress|Congress]], the FTC recognized the ESRB for having "the strongest self-regulatory code" of all entertainment sectors because of its enforcement of advertising and marketing guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/ftc-praises-us-game-regulation-code | title=FTC Praises US Game Regulation Code | publisher=Future Publishing | work=Edge | date=December 4, 2009 | accessdate=March 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-mratedvideo"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/03/m-rated-video-the-esrb-and-video-game-trailers/ | title=M-rated video: the ESRB and video game trailers | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ratings accuracy===
The ESRB has often been accused of not rating certain games, such as ''[[Manhunt (video game)|Manhunt]]'' and the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series, harshly enough for violence and other related themes, and for lacking [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] in certain aspects of the ratings process. Critics have argued that some games only received the M rating rather than the stricter AO rating because of the commercial effects of such a rating; console manufacturers and most retailers refuse to distribute AO-rated games, dramatically affecting their commercial availability. An ESRB representative stated that the Board uses the AO rating when warranted, even due to violence, and that in most occasions, publishers would edit the game to meet the M rating to ensure wide commercial availability instead of keeping the AO rating.&lt;ref name="gi-ratingsgame"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ratings Game: The Controversy Over The ESRB |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200610/N06.1004.1635.57594.htm |work=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=March 19, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023055510/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200610/N06.1004.1635.57594.htm |archivedate=October 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-worldratings"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB president Patricia Vance's plan for a world ratings solution|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/168233/ESRB_president_Patricia_Vances_plan_for_a_world_ratings_solution.php|work=Gamasutra|publisher=UBM plc|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnmoney-snuff"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2003/11/26/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/ | title=Snuff games and ratings | publisher=[[Time Warner]] | work=[[CNNMoney]] | accessdate=March 19, 2014 | date=November 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film classification boards of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] of [[British Columbia]] and [[Ontario]] respectively classified the M-rated games ''[[Soldier of Fortune (video game)|Soldier of Fortune]]'' and ''Manhunt'' as [[film]]s due to concerns over the nature of their content, and gave them [[Canadian motion picture rating system|"Restricted"]] ratings, legally restricting their sale to adults.&lt;ref name="cbc-rrated"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ontario-slaps-r-rating-on-video-game-1.473046 |work=CBC News |title=Ontario slaps 'R' rating on video game |date=March 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc-manitobaviolent"&gt;{{cite news|title=Manitoba moves to rate violent video games|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba-moves-to-rate-violent-video-games-1.477320|accessdate=March 19, 2014|newspaper=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a correlation between the M rating and sales; a 2007 study by Electronic Entertainment Design and Research found that M-rated games "have both the highest average [[Metacritic]] scores and the highest average gross sales in the United States", and [[NPD Group]] found that 7 of the top 20 video games of 2010 (including the #1 game, ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'') were M-rated, even though only 5% of games released that year carried the rating.&lt;ref name="ars-5percentm"&gt;{{cite web|title=2010: 5% of games given M rating, including 29% of big sellers|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/03/in-2010-5-percent-of-games-were-rated-m/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="engadget-higherrating"&gt;{{cite web|title=Study: M rated games have higher scores, better sales|url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/09/11/study-m-rated-games-have-higher-scores-better-sales/|website=Engadget|publisher=AOL|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[National Institute on Media and the Family]] criticized the ESRB for seldom-using the Adults Only rating, arguing because it has a [[Vested interest (communication theory)|vested interest]] in the video game industry, it did not want to perform actions that would affect their commercial availability. The organization stated that "study after study shows that ratings would be stricter if parents were doing the job. It took [[Hot Coffee mod|explicit porn]] to get ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' an AO rating, even though the original version, still rated M, rewards players whose on-screen persona had sex with prostitutes and then killed them. We have been calling for AO ratings for the ''Grand Theft Auto'' series for years—now it is clear why the ESRB has ignored our request." The ESRB disputed these claims, arguing that the organization "relies on flawed research and ignores any and all conflicting evidence", was "imposing its own narrow values and morality on the rest of the country, regardless that it has little evidence to show that parents agree with their point of view", and did not reply to the ESRB's request for comments following its report card in 2004. The board also pointed out that the NIMF's study and "[[report card]]" used data from PSVRatings, a for-profit competitor to the ESRB.&lt;ref name="ars-decry"/&gt;

On the other hand, some have felt that the "Mature" rating is too broad; [[video game journalism|video game journalist]] Ben Kuchera noted that ''[[Halo 3]]''—a [[sci-fi]] [[first-person shooter]] whose level of violence was, in his opinion, comparable to a ''[[Star Wars]]'' film, had received an M rating for "Blood and Gore," "Mild Language" and "Violence". He argued that "having a game like ''Halo 3'' share the same rating as ''[[Saints Row IV]]'', which carries the 'Blood,' Intense Violence,' 'Partial Nudity,' 'Sexual Content,' 'Strong Language' and 'Use of Drugs' descriptors was always silly, and it weakened the thrust of the ratings system." Likewise, he felt that the tone and content of the PG-13 rated film ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' was relatively harsher to children than that of the ''[[Saints Row (series)|Saints Row]]'' series due to the latter's light-hearted tone, but still noted that "as parents we know what's right and what isn't for our kids, and being aware of the content they consume is a large part of our job as parents."&lt;ref name="polygon-destinyrating"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kuchera|first1=Ben|title=Destiny's Teen rating fixes Halo's goofiest problem: a Mature rating that never made sense|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/26/5845600/destiny-esrb-teen-rating-halo|website=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'', the most recent installment in the franchise, received a "Teen" rating instead of "Mature". Microsoft [[Xbox]] division executive Aaron Greenberg argued that consumers had been "surprised" by the M rating on previous installments "given the style of the game and the lack of real graphic violence and things like that", but that the "Teen" rating would theoretically enable the game to reach a broader audience of younger players.&lt;ref name="gamespot-halo5teen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Halo 5's Teen Rating Will Improve Sales, Xbox Exec Says|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-5s-teen-rating-will-improve-sales-xbox-exec-s/1100-6431866/|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adults Only rating ===
The "Adults Only" (AO) rating has attracted a negative stigma among the video game industry—one which has been criticized for stifling the ability for developers to have creative freedom in their portrayal of certain themes in a game, at the risk of being commercially unviable due to publishers' objections to AO-rated content. AO-rated games cannot be published for major video game console platforms, and most retailers do not stock AO-rated games. ESRB President Patricia Vance argued that applying self-censorship to ensure marketability was a compromise that is "true in every entertainment medium", but still believed that the idea of the AO rating eventually becoming acceptable would be a good thing for the ESRB system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/168266/We_could_use_more_Adults_Only_games_says_ESRBs_Vance.php|title=We could use more 'Adults Only' games, says ESRB's Vance|date=April 10, 2012|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stigma is primarily affected by a perception by the industry and other activists that video games are [[Think of the children|generally considered children's products]]; for example, the availability of a [[Wii]] version of ''[[Manhunt 2]]'' was condemned by Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] over fears that children could use the game's [[Wii Remote|motion controls]] to act out the game's "many graphic torture scenes and murders".&lt;ref name="polygon-aoartform"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the Adults Only rating may be pointless and harmful to games as an art form|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/10/5362502/adults-only-rating-pointless-and-harmful-games-as-art-form|work=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/10/5397680/the-cold-war-on-the-ao-rating-must-stop-if-gaming-is-to-grow-up|title=The cold war on the Adults Only rating must stop if gaming is to grow up|date=February 20, 2014|author=Ben Kuchera|publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|accessdate=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon-mutedviolence"&gt;{{cite web|title=A history of (muted) violence|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/8/8/4595050/adults-only-ao-games|work=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attitudes towards AO-rated games have also been influenced by the types of games that have received the rating; Peter Payne, head of [[Peach Princess]], a publisher of English translations of Japanese [[eroge]] [[visual novel]]s, believed that the "Adults Only" rating had acquired a "smutty" and "tasteless" reputation since the majority of AO-rated titles were either niche pornographic titles such as eroge games, or immature titles such as ''[[Riana Rouge]]'' (which ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' described as a game which had the quality of an [[adult movie]], and "[aimed] to do nothing more than tell low-brow jokes and show nude women prancing around") and ''[[Lula 3D]]'' (whose packaging advertised the inclusion of "Bouncin' [[Breast|Boobs]] Technology").&lt;ref name="polygon-aoartform"/&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon-mutedviolence"/&gt;

By contrast, the ESRB has only officially issued the AO rating for extreme violence three times: ''[[Thrill Kill]]'', a fighting game with heavy sexual overtones, received an AO rating with content descriptors for "Animated Violence" and "Animated Blood and Gore". Due to objections over the game's content, ''Thrill Kill'' was canceled by [[Electronic Arts]] after it acquired the North American operations of the game's publisher, [[Virgin Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-512347.html |title=EA kills 'Thrill Kill' game before release |work=[[ZDNet]] |date=October 15, 1998 |accessdate=December 18, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116223732/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-512347.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Manhunt 2]]'' also received an AO rating for its extreme violence; while the uncut version would be released exclusively for PCs, the console versions were edited to meet the M rating criteria.&lt;ref name="gamespot-manhunt2pc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/manhunt-2-pc-gets-ao-rating/1100-6216220/ | title=Manhunt 2 PC gets AO rating | publisher=CBS Interactive | work=GameSpot | accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-manhuntsaga"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/06/the-manhunt-saga-esrb-assigns-ao-rating/ | title=The Manhunt Saga: ESRB assigns AO rating | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-manhunt2newrating"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/08/manhunt-2-will-see-halloween-release-date-after-getting-m-rating/ | title=Manhunt 2 will see Halloween release date after getting M rating | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, ''[[Hatred (video game)|Hatred]]'', a controversial game whose plot centers around a character indiscriminately murdering everyone he encounters, received the rating for its extreme violence and harsh language; one of the game's developers disputed the rating, arguing that "its violence isn't really that bad and this harsh language isn't overused", but also acknowledged the rarity of their situation.&lt;ref name="polygon-hatredao"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hatred given Adults Only rating in US and Canada|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/16/7557639/hatred-esrb-ao-rating|website=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon: revels"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/10/16/6988687/the-worst-trailer-of-the-year-revels-in-slaughtering-innocents |accessdate=October 16, 2014 |title=The worst trailer of the year revels in slaughtering innocents |last=Campbell |first=Colin |date=October 16, 2014 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TNPdKo0E?url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/10/16/6988687/the-worst-trailer-of-the-year-revels-in-slaughtering-innocents |archivedate=October 16, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GabeApology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Crossley|first=Rob|title=Gabe Newell Steps in to Reinstate Controversial Shooter on Steam|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/gabe-newell-steps-in-to-reinstate-controversial-sh/1100-6424263/|publisher=''[[GameSpot]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Hot Coffee mod|ESRB re-rating of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion}}
In 2005, members of the [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]] community discovered that the PC version of ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' could be modified to unlock an incomplete sex [[minigame]] known as "Hot Coffee", which [[Rockstar North]] had decided to leave out of the final game. The discovery of the minigame caused [[California State Assembly]]man [[Leland Yee]] to rebuke both Rockstar and the ESRB, arguing that the ESRB was not doing its job properly. US Senators [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Joe Lieberman]] also expressed their disapproval. Rockstar initially claimed that the minigame was created by the mod community and was not a part of the original game.

In May 2006, ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' had its rating changed from T to M due to "more detailed depictions of blood and gore than were considered in the original rating", along with a third-party mod for the PC version allowing the use of topless female characters. The game's publisher, [[Bethesda Softworks]], decided not to re-edit the game or contest the new rating, but noted that ''Oblivion''{{'}}s content was "not typical" of games with the M rating, and that the game "does not present the central themes of violence that are common to those products."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esrb.org/about/news/downloads/oblivion_release_5.3.06.pdf |title=ESRB Changes Rating For The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion From Teen to Mature |publisher=ESRB |date=May 3, 2006 |accessdate=December 18, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206215229/http://www.esrb.org/about/news/downloads/oblivion_release_5.3.06.pdf |archivedate=February 6, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6148897.html | title=Oblivion rerated M for Mature | publisher=CBS Interactive | work=GameSpot | date=May 3, 2006 | accessdate=December 18, 2006 | last=Sinclair | first=Brendan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6148925.html |title=Bethesda responds to Oblivion rerating |publisher=CBS Interactive |work=GameSpot |date=May 3, 2006 |accessdate=December 18, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310221919/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6148925.html |archivedate=March 10, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of these two incidents, the ESRB changed its policies in June 2006 to account for hidden content; publishers must disclose information surrounding all unlockable or otherwise "hidden" content in the game as part of the ratings process, and publishers can be fined up to US$1 million if they are found to have misrepresented the content of their game after further reviews.&lt;ref name="ars-lying1m" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-changes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esrb-faq"/&gt; In response to the aftermath of Hot Coffee and the resulting policy changes, ESRB President Patricia Vance stated that in her opinion, "there is no other industry self-regulatory system willing or capable of imposing such swift and sweeping sanctions on its own members, which in this particular case resulted in the removal of a top-selling product from the market and a major loss of sales."&lt;ref name="ars-lying1m" /&gt; However, several U.S. politicians, including Senator [[Sam Brownback]], [[California]] Senator [[Leland Yee]], and [[Michigan]] Senator [[Fred Upton]] (who was a major critic against Rockstar during the controversy), still felt that the ESRB had "lost" its trust of consumers, believing that video game developers were taking advantage of the board's [[conflict of interest]] with the industry to incorporate objectionable content into their products without the ESRB's full knowledge.&lt;ref name="escapist-esrb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/96828/Yee_Blasts_ESRB_For_Grand_Theft_Auto_San_Andreas_Rating.php|title=Yee Blasts ESRB For Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Rating|date=July 5, 2005|author=[[Simon Carless]]|work=[[Gamasutra]]|publisher=[[UBM plc|UBM]]|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-truthact"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-vgda"/&gt;

In late 2006, both Upton and Brownback tabled bills to place governmental oversight on aspects of the ESRB rating process, and make it illegal for publishers to misrepresent the playable content of a video game to a ratings board; Upton proposed a bill known as the  [[Video Game Decency Act]], explaining that developers had "done an end-run around the process to deliver violent and pornographic material to our kids", and that the bill would "[go] hand in hand with the mission of the industry’s own ratings system." Brownback proposed a bill known as the [[Truth in Video Game Rating Act]], which would have also forced the ESRB to have full, hands-on access to games instead of just video footage, and have initiated a government study on the "effectiveness" of the organization and the possibility of forming a ratings organization independent from the video game industry.&lt;ref name="escapist-esrb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-truthact"&gt;{{cite web|title=Brownback Re-Intros Truth in Video Game Rating Act|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/103712/Brownback_ReIntros_Truth_in_Video_Game_Rating_Act.php|work=Gamasutra|publisher=UBM plc|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-vgda"&gt;{{cite web|title=Video Game Decency Act of 2006 Introduced To Senate|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11070|work=Gamasutra|publisher=UBM plc|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Microtransactions ===
In October 2017, in response to growing criticism of the [[loot box]] model for video game [[microtransactions]] (which grant chances at earning randomized items of various rarities, typically cosmetic in nature, in exchange for payment), the ESRB stated their opinion that they were not a form of gambling. They described them as a voluntary and optional aspect of a video game, and comparable to [[booster pack]]s for [[collectible card game]]s because their purchase guarantees that a user will receive items at all, but not necessarily high-value items all the time. The ESRB added that games that contain actual wagering of real money would hold the Adults Only rating.&lt;ref name="kotaku-esrblootboxes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/esrb-says-it-doesnt-see-loot-boxes-as-gambling-1819363091|title=ESRB Says It Doesn't See 'Loot Boxes' As Gambling|last=Schreier|first=Jason|date=October 11, 2017|work=[[Kotaku]]|accessdate=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/news/state-legislators-weigh-law-to-block-battlefront-ii-sale-w512412 | title = State Legislators Weigh Law to Block Sale of 'Battlefront II' to Children | first = Brian | last = Crecente | date = November 22, 2017 | accessdate = November 22, 2017 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2018, U.S. senator [[Maggie Hassan]] asked the ESRB to examine if games with loot box microtransactions were being marketed in an "ethical and transparent way" that "adequately protects the developing minds of young children from predatory practices."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/02/us-senator-demands-review-of-loot-box-policies-citing-potential-harm/|title=US Senator demands review of loot box policies, citing potential harm [Updated]|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ESRB subsequently announced on February 27, 2018, that it would introduce a new label for any games that contain "the ability to purchase digital goods or premiums with real world currency". The announcement was criticized for being overreaching and ambiguous, as it applies to not only microtransactions, but any purchases of digital goods in relation to a game (which includes [[downloadable content]]), and would thus apply to almost all modern video games. Patrica Vance stated that the ESRB avoided references to specific types of microtransactions, so that the advisory label could be understood by parents unaware of specific details. Vance added that the ESRB was "unable to find any evidence that children specifically have been [psychologically] impacted by loot boxes" or that they caused children to develop "some sort of tendency towards gambling."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/after-months-of-controversy-esrb-will-add-in-game-purc-1823356171|title=After Months Of Controversy, ESRB Will Add 'In-Game Purchases' Label To Games|last=Schreier|first=Jason|work=Kotaku|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17058400/esrb-in-game-purchases-label-microtransactions-loot-boxes-regulation-oversight|title=ESRB’s loot box response is new "in-game purchases" label that applies to almost every game|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/02/esrb-defends-fun-loot-boxes-as-it-starts-labeling-all-in-game-purchases/|title=ESRB defends "fun" loot boxes as it starts labeling all "in-game purchases" [Updated]|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst ESRB ratings are officially recognised in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and their respective territories, most major game publishers extended their use as ''de facto'' in various South American countries (except for Brazil due to [[Brazilian advisory rating system|its own rating system]]), and, in Nintendo's case, some Asian countries.

'''Fantawild''' ('''Fangte''' in Chinese) is a chain of [[amusement park]]s located in various cities of [[China]]. The first park opened in the mid-to-late 2000s in [[Chongqing]]. {{As of|November 2013}}, ten amusement parks operate under the Fantawild name, with a further park currently under construction. The chain is owned by the Huaqiang Group.&lt;ref name="Hi-tech parks open in China"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hi-tech parks open in China |journal=Park World Magazine |date=18 December 2007 |url=http://www.parkworld-online.com/news/archivestory.php/aid/677/Hi-tech_parks_open_in_China.html |accessdate=21 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203045334/http://www.parkworld-online.com/news/archivestory.php/aid/677/Hi-tech_parks_open_in_China.html |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mascot of the parks is a blue dinosaur named DuLuDuBi, and is typically used as the public image for the chain.

'''Feline Fuelled Games''' is a German [[PC game]] [[Video game developer|development team]] whose [[Mod (video gaming)|mods]] for the [[role-playing game]]s ''[[Neverwinter Nights 2]]'' by [[Obsidian Entertainment|Obsidian]] and ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]'' by [[BioWare]] have received critical acclaim in the German [[Video game journalism|video game press]]. On 5 May 2017, they will publish their first original game, the [[Graphic adventure game|point-and-click adventure]] ''Sandra and Woo in the Cursed Adventure'' based on the [[webcomic]] ''[[Sandra and Woo]]''.

== History ==

=== Before the Foundation ===

Before Feline Fuelled Games was established in 2004, its founder Oliver Knörzer and several other team members, among them Eric Dunkel and Matthias Geißler, developed the campaign ''Silberwald: Der Ring des Schicksals'' (''Silver Forest: The Ring of Destiny'') for [[BioWare]]'s ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' which was released on 21 July 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.felinefuelledgames.de/silberwald/srdsarch/srdsarch.html |title=Silberwald - Der Ring des Schicksals: Newsarchiv |first=Oliver |last=Knörzer |date=2003-07-21 |work=Silberwald: Der Ring des Schicksals |publisher=Oliver Knörzer |accessdate=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a surprise hit with more than 30,000 downloads at the biggest ''Neverwinter Nights'' [[fansite]] NWVault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Modules.Detail&amp;id=1961 |title=Silberwald: Der Ring des Schicksals - Neverwinter Nights 2 Vault |work=Neverwinter Nights 2 Vault |publisher=IGN Entertainment |accessdate=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Silberwald: Der Ring des Schicksals'' received an overall score of 78% in a test by Georg Valentin of the second biggest German game magazine [[GameStar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Valentin |first1=Georg |year=2003 |title=Neverwinter Nights: Silberwald |journal=GameStar Sonderheft 04/2003: Mods &amp; Levels |publisher=IDG Entertainment Verlag GmbH |volume=4 |pages=34 |language=German |url=http://www.felinefuelledgames.de/silberwald/srdstest.jpg }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was the subject of the TV show Giga Games which aired on 25 July 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Giga Games |series=Giga Games |network=Giga |airdate=2003-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oliver's mother Ute Knörzer, who designed levels and wrote dialog for ''Silberwald: Der Ring des Schicksals'', then moved on to develop the mods ''Silberwald Saga: Dunkle Sonne'' (''Silver Forest Legend: Dark Sun''), a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the original ''Silberwald'' campaign, and ''Das Lied der Götter'' for ''Neverwinter Nights''. The latter one was later translated into English among the title ''The Song Divine'' and has been included into NWVault’s ''Hall of Fame'' list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Modules.Detail&amp;id=3575 |title=The Song Divine / Das Lied der Götter (Bilingual Version) -- Neverwinter Nights 2 Vault |work=Neverwinter Nights 2 Vault |publisher=IGN Entertainment |accessdate=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mods for Neverwinter Nights 2 ===

After ''Neverwinter Nights 2'' was announced by Obsidian, Oliver Knörzer and Ute Knörzer began the development of a new campaign called ''Gaia: Chroniken des 3. Zeitalters'' (''Gaia: Chronicles of the Third Age'') for it in 2004. Some old and new team members joined them over the course of 2004 and 2005 and the mod group was given its name Feline Fuelled Games on 29 September 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.felinefuelledgames.de/archiv.shtml |title=Feline Fuelled Games - Archiv |first=Oliver |last=Knörzer |date=2005-09-29 |work=Feline Fuelled Games |publisher=Oliver Knörzer |language=German |accessdate=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; referring a story arc of the [[webcomic]] ''[[Dragon Tails (webcomic)|Dragon Tails]]'' about an incompetent video game developer company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dragon-tails.com/comics/archive.php?date=030128 |title=Comic strip for the 28th of January, 2003 |first=Tim |last=Dawson |date=2003-01-28 |work=Dragon Tales |publisher=Tim Dawson |accessdate=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project turned out to be too ambitious, though, and was eventually cancelled in 2006 with Oliver Knörzer also resigning as lead developer. However, Feline Fuelled Games, now led by Ute Knörzer, managed to release several other mods during the next years and grew to 20 team members as of March 2012, including the second lead developer Walter Oswald.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.felinefuelledgames.de/team.shtml |title=Feline Fuelled Games – Team |first=Oliver |last=Knörzer |date= |work=Feline Fuelled Games |publisher=Oliver Knörzer |language=German |accessdate=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of a new mod, like the one of the fourth chapter of the ''Planescape: Die Traumfängerin'' series, is usually mentioned on German video game websites such as GameCaptain, Gamezone and Gameswelt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamecaptain.de/News/20048/Neverwinter_Nights_2_-_Neues_Fan-Modul_erschienen.html |title=Neverwinter Nights 2 - Neues Fan-Modul erschienen |first=Jörg |last=Benne |date=2009-03-28 |work=GameCaptain |publisher=Maiwald &amp; Benne GbR |accessdate=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamezone.de/news_detail.asp?nid=72513 |title=Neverwinter Nights 2: Neues Modul als Download verfügbar |author=BigJim |date=2009-03-29 |work=Gamezone |publisher=Codezero AG |accessdate=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameswelt.de/news/36958-Neverwinter_Nights_2_Die_Traumfaengerin_-_Viertes_Kapital_von_kostenlosem_Add-on_verfuegbar.html |title=Neverwinter Nights 2: Die Traumfängerin - Viertes Kapital von kostenlosem Add-on verfügbar |first=Tobias |last=Simon |date=2009-03-29 |work=Gameswelt |publisher=Web Media Publishing AG |accessdate=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Herz der Finsternis'' ====

The first mod released by Feline Fuelled Games was ''Herz der Finsternis'' (''Heart of Darkness'') on 9 December 2007, which was developed by Ute Knörzer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.felinefuelledgames.de/archiv.shtml |title=Feline Fuelled Games - Archiv |first=Oliver |last=Knörzer |date=2007-12-09 |work=Feline Fuelled Games |publisher=Oliver Knörzer |language=German |accessdate=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Herz der Finsternis'' is the direct sequel of ''Das Lied der Götter'' and was praised by Andreas Bertits as "a fantastic adventure" that "no fan of the main game [Neverwinter Nights 2] and fantasy stories should miss" in his reviews of the campaign for the game magazines [[PC Games (magazine)|PC Games]] and [[PC Action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bertits |first1=Andreas |title=Neverwinter Nights 2: Herz der Finsternis |journal=PC Games |date=March 2008 |publisher=Computec Media AG |volume=3 |pages=32–33 |language=German |url=http://www.felinefuelledgames.de/images/pcgames.jpg }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bertits |first1=Andreas |year=2008 |title=Neverwinter Nights 2: Herz der Finsternis |journal=PC Action 04/2008 |publisher=Computec Media AG |volume=4 |pages=121 |language=German |url=http://www.felinefuelledgames.de/images/pcaction.jpg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Der Fluch der Zwerge'' series ====

The release of ''Herz der Finsternis'' was followed by the release of the first part of the ''Der Fluch der Zwerge'' (''The Curse of the Dwarfs'') series by lead developer Walter Oswald on 5 March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.felinefuelledgames.de/archiv.shtml |title=Feline Fuelled Games - Archiv |first=Oliver |last=Knörzer |date=2008-03-05 |work=Feline Fuelled Games |publisher=Oliver Knörzer |language=German |accessdate=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until January 2011 five parts of the ''Der Fluch der Zwerge'' series have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.felinefuelledgames.de/dfdzdownload.shtml |title=Der Fluch der Zwerge – Download |first=Oliver |last=Knörzer |work=Feline Fuelled Games |publisher=Oliver Knörzer |language=German |accessdate=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its second chapter has been described by Andreas Bertits of PC Games as "extensive and exciting adventure" and his colleague Marc Brehme wrote in his review of the first part of the third chapter that they (the PC Games team) were once again "convinced by the quality of the fan extension".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bertits |first1=Andreas |title=Neverwinter Nights 2: Der Fluch der Zwerge |journal=PC Games |date=July 2008 |publisher=Computec Media AG |volume=7 |pages= |language=German |url=http://www.felinefuelledgames.de/images/pcgames_dfdz1.jpg }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bertits |first1=Andreas |year= |title=Neverwinter Nights 2: Der Fluch der Zwerge |journal=PC Action 07/2008 |publisher=Computec Media AG |volume= |pages= |language=German |url=http://www.felinefuelledgames.de/images/pcaction_dfdz1.jpg }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bertits |first1=Andreas |title=Der Fluch der Zwerge 2 |journal=PC Games |date=August 2009 |publisher=Computec Media AG |volume=8 |pages=118 |language=German |url=http://www.felinefuelledgames.de/images/pcgames_dfdz2.jpg }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brehme |first1=Marc |title=Der Fluch der Zwerge 3 – Kapitel 1 |journal=PC Games |date=May 2010 |publisher=Computec Media AG |volume=5 |pages=132 |language=German |url=http://www.felinefuelledgames.de/images/pcgames_dfdz3-1.jpg }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brehme |first1=Marc |year=2010 |title=Der Fluch der Zwerge 3: Kapitel 1: Auf dem Fluss |journal=PC Action 05/2010 |publisher=Computec Media AG |volume=5 |pages=124 |language=German |url=http://www.felinefuelledgames.de/images/pcgames_dfdz3-1.jpg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Planescape: Die Traumfängerin'' series ====

After the release of ''Herz der Finsternis'', Ute Knörzer began the development of the ''Planescape: Die Traumfängerin'' (''Planescape: The Shaper of Dreams'') series, her most ambitious project so far. The first chapter was released on 11 August 2008 and the sixth and last chapter on 30 August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.felinefuelledgames.de/archiv.shtml |title=Feline Fuelled Games - Archiv |first=Oliver |last=Knörzer |date=2008-08-11 |work=Feline Fuelled Games |publisher=Oliver Knörzer |language=German |accessdate=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.felinefuelledgames.de/index.shtml |title=Feline Fuelled Games – Neuigkeiten |first=Oliver |last=Knörzer |date=2009-08-30 |work=Feline Fuelled Games |publisher=Oliver Knörzer |language=German |accessdate=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Planescape: Die Traumfängerin'' received the most critical acclaim of all mods developed by Feline Fuelled Games so far with Andreas Bertits of PC Games giving the following review of the second chapter: "The mod by Ute Knörzer will take you into a strange but fascinating world. The appealing story motivates to continue playing with lots of puzzles and twists. The varied and pretty areas, the game changing decisions, the many interesting non-player characters and the exciting fights create a unique gaming experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bertits |first1=Andreas |year=2008 |title=Neverwinter Nights 2: Die Traumfängerin |journal=PC Action 12/2008 |publisher=Computec Media AG |volume=12 |pages= |language=German |url=http://www.felinefuelledgames.de/images/pcaction_pdt.jpg }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bertits |first1=Andreas |title=Die Traumfängerin 2 |journal=PC Games |date=August 2009 |publisher=Computec Media AG |volume=8 |pages=117 |language=German |url=http://www.felinefuelledgames.de/images/pcgames_pdt2.jpg }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first three chapters of the campaign have also been translated into English and are listed as second highest rated mod on NWVault’s top mods list with a score of 9.91 as of May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=NWN2ModulesEnglish.Detail&amp;id=408 |title=Chapters 1+2 - Planescape: The Shaper of Dreams -- Neverwinter Nights 2 Vault |work=Neverwinter Nights 2 Vault |publisher=IGN Entertainment |accessdate=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nwvault.ign.com/fms/TopRated.php?content=nwn2modulesenglish |title=Top NwN2 Modules -- Neverwinter Nights 2 Vault |work=Neverwinter Nights 2 Vault |publisher=IGN Entertainment |accessdate=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mods for Dragon Age: Origin ===

==== ''Synapsia'' ====

On 17 July 2010, Feline Fuelled Games released ''Synapsia'', their first mod for ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]''.&lt;ref name="news" /&gt; It was rated as an "outstanding" mod in a review by Marc Brehme for PC Action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brehme |first1=Marc |year=2010 |title=Synapsia |journal=PC Action 09/2010 |publisher=Computec Media AG |volume=9 |pages=114–115 |language=German |url=http://www.felinefuelledgames.de/images/pcaction-2010-09-synapsia-2.jpg }}&lt;/ref&gt; The humorous campaign is an extended version of the original mod for Neverwinter Nights 2 with the same title by Gabriele Schmied that was published on 12 December 2009.&lt;ref name="news" /&gt;

==== ''Chroniken von Coldramar'' ====

On 16 October 2011, Feline Fuelled Games released ''Chroniken von Coldramar'' (''Chronicles of Coldramar''), a campaign for ''Dragon Age: Origins'' centering on the adventures of three young barbarians.&lt;ref name="news" /&gt; As Feline Fuelled Games' most advanced mod so far, ''Chroniken von Coldramar'' featured a full voice-over carried out by professional [[Voice acting|voice artists]], custom music and almost 90 minutes of [[cutscene]]s. In his three-page review of the modification in PC Action 12/2011, Mark Brehme concluded that it "turned out so well that it may likely pass as an add-on you have to pay for."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brehme |first1=Marc |year=2012 |title=Drei sind keiner zuviel! |journal=PC Action 12/2011 |

[[Ray Middleton (actor)|Ray Middleton]] originated the role of Frank in the musical opposite [[Ethel Merman]] as Annie. [[Howard Keel]] starred in the film version opposite Betty Hutton. [[Bruce Yarnell]] played Butler in a 1966 [[Lincoln Center]] revival, with [[Ethel Merman]] again as Annie Oakley. [[Tom Wopat]] played the role of Butler in the 1999 Broadway revival. In 1957, a television production starring [[Mary Martin]] and [[John Raitt]] was broadcast on NBC.

'''Hindi theatre''' primarily refers to [[Theatre in India|theatre]] performed in the [[Hindi language]], including dialects such as [[Khari boli]] and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]. Hindi theatre is produced mainly in
[[North India]], and some parts of [[West India]] and Central India, which include Mumbai and Bhopal. Hindi theatre has its roots in the traditional folk theatre of North India, like [[Ram lila]] and [[Raslila]], and also influenced by distant [[Sanskrit drama]]. Starting with [[Bhartendu Harishchandra]] in the late 19th century and subsequent playwrights like [[Jaishankar Prasad]], [[Mohan Rakesh]], Hindi theatre came of age in the 1940s and 50s, when [[Indian People's Theatre Association|IPTA]] movement created a new brand of theatre practitioners in Hindi speaking areas, especially with [[Indian People's Theatre Association|IPTA]] Mumbai, [[Prithvi Theatres]] of thespian [[Prithviraj Kapoor]], and theatre artiste Habib Tanvir, paving way for next generation of artists who came out once [[National School of Drama]], Delhi started functioning in 1959.&lt;ref name=fi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hochman44/&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
The advent of [[Mughal empire]] meant the lasting and definite end of Sanskrit as everyday language and along with it theatre traditions, though it also gave birth to a synergistic traditions of [[Urdu]] and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] languages, that developed in the aftermath of a fast amalgamating diverse cultures. Traditional folk theatre which included Ramlila, Raslila and [[nautanki]] had evolved despite the absence of royal patronage and where it was present, as in the case Ramlila of [[Kingdom of Kashi|Kashi Kingdom]], in [[Ramnagar, Varanasi]], it evolved into a highly evolved form, with shifting locations. Elsewhere in [[Awadh]], [[Wajid Ali Shah]] had been experimenting forms like [[thumri]] and stage style known as ''rahasa'', it achieved a definite style in a play believed to be commissioned by him, ''[[Inder Sabha]]'', an Urdu play by [[Agha Hasan Amanat]], first staged in 1853.&lt;ref name=am/&gt;

Besides a separate tradition of [[Maithili language|Maithili]] plays, which flourished in the 17th century in present-day [[Bihar]], [[North India]] had a pre-existing tradition of folk theatre, this included [[Braj Bhasa]] verse plays in the 18th century, [[Swang (dance drama)|Swang]], the [[operatic]] tradition, which featured full-throated male singers and dancing by female impersonators, which evolved from reciting popular folk ballads and epics, and by the 1860s they were being performed across Meerut, Delhi and Banaras, and illustrated [[libretto]]s, known as ''Sangits'' were being printed in [[Devanagari]] script. In the coming decades, it too got influenced by [[Parsi theatre]], and further developed in content both thematic and music, in the 1890s onwards, which somewhere in the early 20th-century started being called [[nautanki]], after the tale of a ''Nautanki [[Shahzadi]]'' became a popular theme. However this form lost much of its popularity and films made into road to rural area after the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Han|Hansen, p. 64]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, with the discovery of [[Kālidāsa|Kalidas]]’s ''[[Abhijnanasakuntalam]]'' by Western scholars, it became the first Indian drama to be translated into a Western language, by [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]] in 1789. In the next a hundred years, there were at least 46 translations in twelve European languages.&lt;ref name=completer&gt;[http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/sanskrit/ksakun1a.htm Review] of Figueira's ''Translating the Orient: The Reception of Sakuntala in Nineteenth-Century Europe'' at the [[complete review]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn initiated a concerted study and interest of [[Sanskrit drama]] tradition. In time the full extent of ancient Indian theatre's prowess came into light, which had been long lost, as classical Sanskrit drama mostly written from the 4th and 8th century AD faded out, with death of Sanskrit as a spoken language by the 10th century, only to be discovered many centuries later.&lt;ref name=fi&gt;{{cite news |title=Drama of the Indian theatre journey|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/printer/news/177787/ |publisher=Financial Express|date=17 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as the first capital of [[British India]], Calcutta, saw the rise of [[Bengali theatre]] in the light of [[Bengal renaissance]]  early 19th century, at the same time [[Parsi]] theatre was coming up in Mumbai, inspired by English-style playhouses which had come up in the late 18th century in Mumbai and Kolkata, exclusively for the Raj gentry. Taking over the same proscenium stages, Parsi theatre took cue their European theatricality, but it brought in Indian themes, thus it  "blended [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and [[fantasy]], music and dance, narrative and spectacle, earthy dialogue and ingenuity of stage presentation, integrating them into a dramatic discourse of [[melodrama]].

These sources had also provided themes to the native Swang tradition, leading to cross-enrichment after ''Victoria Natak Mandali'' became the first Parsi theatre company to perform in Varanasi, in 1875. These theatre companies presented their mix of pure entertainment and nationalism during the [[Indian freedom struggle]]. This return of written dramatic text to theatre, after centuries, made Parsi theatre not just the role model for the first Indian talkies, as numerous Paris theatre producers moved to cinema, but also gave birth to a theatre tradition, that continued even after Parsi theatre died out as the talkies made their first appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Women's issues: an Indian perspective|author=Lakshmi Misra |publisher=Northern Book Centre|year=1992|isbn=978-81-7211-017-8|page=65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xcv2bXaGWb0C&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=%22Hindi+theatre%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Hindi%20theatre%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&amp;f=false  |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Han|Hansen, p. 75]]&lt;/ref&gt; Panned by Hindi litterateurs, Bhartendu and [[Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi]], Parsi theatre through its veritable presence, however provoked the elite theatre of refinement as a clear reaction.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Han|Hansen, p. 77]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Hindi theatre 1868 and after===

Early development of modern Hindi theatre can be traced to the work of [[Bharatendu Harishchandra]] (1850–1885), a theatre actor, director, manager, and playwright based in [[Varanasi]] (Banaras), who is also the father of modern [[Hindi literature]] as in his short life of 35 years, he edited two magazines, ''Kavi vachan Sudha'' and ''Harishchandra chandrika'', wrote numerous volumes of verse in Braj bhasa, essays and eighteen plays, thus laying the foundation of modern Hindi prose style. Well-versed in folk theatre styles and oral literary traditions of the region, he was influenced by the [[Bengal Renaissance]], however his principle influence was the ancient Sanskrit Drama, many of which he translated and established a stream of dramaturgy which has run parallel to development of the Western drama, though he even translated a Shakespeare's play. Rooted in the rising tide of Indian nationalism, he is most noted for his politically charged plays like, ''Andher nagari'' (City of Darkness) written in 1881, a clear satire on the [[British Raj]], as it implied that a society which tolerates a lawless state is doomed to fail, and ''Neel Darpan'' (Indigo Mirror) on plight of [[indigo dye|indigo]]-plantation worker under the British Raj, which used the [[Dramatic Performances Act]] of 1876 to the ban many such subversive plays.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dm|Dimitrova, p. 14]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Han|Hansen, p. 62]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Han|Hansen, p. 78]]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Bharatendu became director of ''Hindi Natak Samaj'' (Hindu National Theatre) in Banaras.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[[#Han|Hansen, p. 81]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Bhartendu whose productions were largely funded by himself or at times by Maharaja of Kashi, Hindi theatre went through a phase of struggle, due to lack of sponsors, [[impresario]]s or efficient [[theatre manager]]s, thus there was hardly any professional theatre for many decades, discouraging writers to take to playwrighting, even works of important playwrights of this period, Jaishankar Prasad and [[Upendranath Ashk]] were mostly read, yet hardly staged. Prevalent conservatism didn't allow the female actors to take to stage and unlike [[Marathi theatre]] of Mumbai or [[Bengali theatre]] of Calcutta, Hindi theatre remained a struggling force, despite the presence of a large audience, which went to the extent of the entertainment-driven Parsi theatre companies. Only a handful of amateur theatre groups presented their works at improvised or makeshift stages, in a period when like many popular writers, intellectuals too had turned away from theatre.&lt;ref name="Das, 159"&gt;[[#Das|Das, p. 159]]&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of [[talkies]] in 1931, with ''[[Alam Ara]]'', meant outflow of Hindi theatre audience that had already dwindled away after the incursions by Parsi theatre across the Hindi-speaking belt. Soon theatre actors, director, writers and technicians followed suit, shifting to Mumbai, the base for [[Hindi cinema]], where the promise of easy money from studios was too captivating to resist. As a result, numerous theatre companies and playhouses closed down and some started showing cinema, the new medium of the age. As the masses moved away from theatre, lured by the glitz of cinema, which Parsi theatre provided readily till now, theatre landscape was now populated by an educated and sophisticated audience, moving away from cinema in response to its escapism, looking for realistic and socially-relevant plays.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch|Chambers, p. 380]]&lt;/ref&gt;

20th-century Hindi theatre received a fresh impetus through [[Indian People's Theatre Association]] (IPTA). Though formed in 1942, with left-wing ideologies, after the All India People's Theatre Conference was held in Mumbai in 1943, IPTA Mumbai was formed&lt;ref&gt;Indian People's Theatre Association. [http://www.mumbaitheatreguide.com/dramas/groups/ipta.asp Article in mumbaitheatreguide.com]&lt;/ref&gt; An important contribution of IPTA was that it was first time that women started taking part in theatre in such a number.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ru|Rubin, p. 182]]&lt;/ref&gt; It created and inspired a generation of theatre practitioners and playwrights, like [[Krishan Chander]], [[Kaifi Azmi]], [[Balraj Sahni]], Mohan Segal, [[Dina Pathak]], Shanti Bardhan, [[Durga Khote]], and others, one of them was [[Prithviraj Kapoor]] who found [[Prithvi Theatre]]s, a travelling theatre troupe, based in Mumbai in 1944, with actors like Prithviraj himself, apart from [[Uzra Butt]], and [[Zohra Sehgal]]. The group was largely funded by Prithviraj Kapoor's film career and functioned till in 1960, when Prithviraj Kapoor's ill health forced its closure before his death in 1972.&lt;ref name=hi&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/11/22/stories/2004112201500100.htm Kissing the firmament with Prithvi Theatre] ''[[The Hindu]]'' 22 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===After independence===
[[Sangeet Natak Akademi]] (SNA), The National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama, was established by the [[Government of India]] in 1952, to promote [[performing arts]]. Another big change in the realm of Hindi theatre was the establishing of [[National School of Drama]] in Delhi in 1959, which had ''Bharatiya Natya Sangh'' (BNS) as its precursor. BNS, with the assistance from [[UNESCO]], independently established the Asian Theatre Institute (ATI) in 1958, and in July 1958, ATI was taken over by the SNA, and merged with newly formed NSD, which initially functioned under SNA before it became an autonomous organisation. With its principal instruction language being Hindi, and stalwarts like [[Ebrahim Alkazi]] and [[Shanta Gandhi]], in the coming decades it produced a number a noted theatre actors and directors. The National School of Drama Repertory Company was set up in 1964, with actor-director [[Om Shivpuri]] as its first head, followed by [[Manohar Singh]], and other actors like [[Uttara Baokar]], [[Sudha Shivpuri]] and [[Surekha Sikri]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090315/spectrum/main1.htm National School of Drama ..over the past 50 years] ''[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]'', 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[RADA]]-trained Alkazi turned out to be the most influential director in the post-independence period; his Hindi productions of Sanskrit classics, like ''Abhijnana Shakuntalam'', [[Dharamvir Bharati]]'s ''[[Andha Yug]]'', [[Girish Karnad]]'s ''Tughlaq'', and the realism of his take on Mohan Rakesh's ''Asadh Ka Ek Din'' brought a fresh approach to theatricality, and sophistication to Hindi theatre, and set up standards that inspired an entire generation.&lt;ref name=ru200&gt;[[#Ru|Rubin, p. 200]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ru|Rubin, p. 190]]&lt;/ref&gt; His production of Dharamvir Bharati's ''Andha Yug'' premiered in 1964 at the [[Firoz Shah Kotla]] and was attended by prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru.&lt;ref name=ht1950s&gt;{{cite news|title=Capital's cultural affair began in 50s|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Capital-s-cultural-affair-began-in-50s/Article1-769751.aspx|publisher=Hindustan Times|date=16 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107233545/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Capital-s-cultural-affair-began-in-50s/Article1-769751.aspx|archivedate=7 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pioneer of the modern theatre movement in North India, [[Raj Bisaria]]- a highly revered stage director, he has a through grounding in western classics and contemporary dramatic works. [[Raj Bisaria]] tried that the dramatic and performing arts conform to a professional discipline and communicate through a new aesthetic medium. His plays are concerned with man-women relationship, and social issues of special concern to him. Through the productions of European and Indian plays since 1966, [[Raj Bisaria]] presented a wide spectrum of contemporary world drama as director and designer, setting his own parallel, pursues the theatre of excellence. He has ventured to blend artistic concepts and impulse of the East and the West, the traditional and the modern, and has been passionately devoted to the cause of theatre and acting. It is his firm belief that this art form can be used for its therapeutic qualities for the overall healthy development of personality of the young, apart from being a vehicle for disseminating information, and creating consciousness about social- political issues, as indeed affording aesthetic and ennobling enlightenment and enriching the cultural consciousness of modern India. Largely using his own devices and creative expression he began his work in the English and began to use Hindustani as the spoken medium of expression from the 1973. He has encouraged folk theatre form of UP - the Nautanki.

[[Raj Bisaria]] suggested to the State Government that he should start a semi-professional repertory theatre in Uttar Pradesh, in 1974 the State Government went a few steps further and requested him to evolve a scheme for establishing a drama school, which would function as a full-fledged academy of dramatic arts. [[Bhartendu Academy of Dramatic Arts]] (BNA), when it was founded in 1975, in Lucknow, (with Raj Bisaria as its founder director) became the first of its kind in the large Hindi belt of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. His major productions of Indian plays have included Dharamvir Bharati's Andha Yug, Badal Sircar's Baqi Itihas, Adya Rangacharya's Suno Janmejaya, Elkunchwar's Garbo, Mohan Rakesh's Aadhe-Adhure, Mohit Chatterjee's Guinea Pig etc. His major and memorable productions have included Maxwell Anderson's Barefoot in Athens; Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Macbeth, Othello, King Lear; George Bernard Shaw's Candida; Harold Pinter's The Caretaker; Sartre's In Camera; Ionesco's The Lesson; Strindberg's Father, Jean Anouilh's Antigone; and various plays of Chekhov, Ionesco, Tennessee Williams, Shaffer and so on.

In the next few years, various states also formed their state academies for the arts, which gave boost to the theatre culture, and soon state capitals like Jaipur, Shimla, Chandigarh, Lucknow and Bhopal had their own theatre groups and culture.&lt;ref name=Hochman44&gt;[[#Ho|Hochman, p. 44]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ru189&gt;[[#Ru|Rubin, p. 189]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, for many years to come, theatre largely remained driven by amateur groups, as full-time theatre did not become a financially viable activity. Most could not afford extensive [[Theatrical property|props]], [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]], [[Lighting designer|lighting design]], or newspaper advertisements and relied on word of mouth and small amount of postering. Many practitioners maintained regular jobs, either at educational institutions or in the corporate sector and rehearsed after working hours in hired spaces, as hardly any theatre group across Hindi theatre owned their own infrastructure, be it rehearsal space or theatre. Theatre directors often doubled as theatre managers, as impresarios were rare and impresario organisations even rarer, and then it was director's name that attracted the audience. As payments to cast and [[Technical crew|crew]] remained arbitrary and severely dependent on the success of the show, many picked up work in other mediums. As state funding was never available for theatre directly, practitioners tried to gain corporate sponsorship, or did "call shows" in other cities to raise money.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch|Chambers, p. 381]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ba|Banham, p. 524]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually a number of theatre venues started coming up, both proscenium and experimental, including Sri Ram Centre, [[Kamani Auditorium]] (1971), Meghdoot theatre (designed by Alkazi), NSD studio theatre, SNA studio theatre, Abhimanch and many others.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ru|Rubin, p. 213]]&lt;/ref&gt;  While many directors like Alkazi staged plays at historical monuments and various innovative venues, [[street theatre]] brought theatre out to the streets completely, including in its content. Just as IPTA-inspired [[Jana Natya Manch]] (JANAM) of [[Safdar Hashmi]] did in the 1970s and 1980 as did [[M. K. Raina]], who staged his production of [[Maxim Gorky]]'s ''The Mother'' in front of factories, inspiring many other practitioners to take theatre to the communities. The Bhopal gas tragedy (1984) saw a new wave of protest presentations in many cities, just as Bhisham Sahni wrote ''Muavze'' (Compensation, 1990) later staged by Raina. Eventually Hashmi was killed in 1989, while his production ''Halla Bol'' (Attack) was being performed in front of a factory in Sahibabad near Delhi by political goons. Though by this time street theatre had been discovered as an important tool and medium, with notable directors like [[Bansi Kaul]] and Prasanna, street theatre had reached prisons, slums and red-light areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ru|Rubin, p. 201]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Habib Tanvir]] is another pioneer in Hindi theatre, who first moved to Mumbai in 1943 from native Bilaspur looking for work in Hindi films that is when he came in contact with IPTA and Progressive Writers Association. He moved to Delhi in 1954 and joined hands with 'Hindustani theatre' of Begum Qudsia Zaidi, writer, and theatre director who had important impact on evolving theatre tradition in Delhi, who together with Habib Tanvir, made its debut with the production of a [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] version of Kalidas's ''Shakuntala'' and later produced [[Shudraka]]'s [[Mrichakatika]] as ''Mitti Ki Gadi'' (Little Clay Cart) as an operatic version in ''[[nautanki]]''-style, using tribal artists.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Da|Datta, p. 1117]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Beyond The Fourth Wall |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?250267 |date=22 June 2009|publisher=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Begum Qudsia Zaidi's daughter is screenwriter [[Shama Zaidi]].&lt;/ref&gt; He successfully wrote and directed ''Agra Bazar'' (1954), before he left for England. After his return from [[RADA]], Habib began his work with [[Chhattisgarh]]i tribals, at the Naya Theatre, a theatre company he founded in 1959 in [[Bhopal]], and went on to include indigenous performance forms such as ''nacha'' to create a new theatrical language, later he wrote ''Charandas Chor'' (1975), ''Gaon ka Naam Sasural, Mor Naam Damad'' and ''Kamdeo ka Apna Basant Ritu ka Sapna'' and notably staged, [[Asghar Wajahat]]'s ''Jis Lahore Nai Dekhya'' (1990).&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-06-09/mumbai/28184258_1_charandas-chor-habib-tanvir-naya-theatre Habib Tanvir makes his final exit] ''[[The Times of India]]'', 9 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cohab/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ru|Rubin, p. 183]]&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from him, [[B. V. Karanth]] too brought in folk forms into his work, staged many productions in Hindi, especially during his stint with the ''Rangamandal repertory'' at the [[Bharat Bhavan]] in Bhopal.&lt;ref name=ru200/&gt;

In the 1960s, like other parts of India, modern Hindi Theatre movement also started in Bihar. Satish Anand, actor and director, is the maker of modern Hindi theatre in Bihar. He is known as trend setter in contemporary modern Indian theatre. Satish Anand established his own theatre group Kala Sangam at Patna, capital of Bihar in 1962. Created a very healthy theatre environment and popularize Hindi plays and theatre by constantly and regularly staging plays like Dharmvir Bharti's Andha Yug, Mudrarakshash's Merjeeva, Mohan Rakesh's Adhe-Adhure, Ashadh Ka Ek Din and Lahron ke Rajhans, Badal Sircar's Baki Itihas, Ballabhpur Ki Roopkatha, Pagla Ghora and Juloos, vijay Tendulkar's Khamosh Adalat jari hai, Jat Hi Puchho Sadhu Ki,Gireesh Karnad's Tughlaq, Sophocles Greek tragedy Oedipus, Rambriksha Benipuri's Ambapali, Shanti Mehrotra's Thahra Hua Pani, Ek Tha Gadha, Kisi Ek Phool Ka Naam Lo, Godan, Chandrashekhar Kambar's Aur Tota Bola, Ibsen's Enemy of the people(Janshatru), Ben Johnson's Volpony (Chor Ke Ghar Mor), Delhi Uncha Sunati Hai, Manoj Mitr's Rajdarshan, Debashish Majumdar's Tamrapatra,Sushil Kumar Singh's Singhasan Khali Hai, Bertolt Brecht's Three Penny Opera ( Do Takkey Ka Swang), Jyoti Mahpseker’s Beti Aayee Hai etc. Kala Sangam’s director Satish Anand  had taken every new production as a theatre workshop. He worked hard and trained actors-actresses in every department. Production of Adhe-Adhure in 1973 was considered a great happening in History of the cultural field of Bihar. This incident was considered as renaissance of theatre in Bihar. Kala Sangam always preferred to take up socio-political-economic issues in its plays. Variety in designing the play-productions with innovative ideas and high class powerful performances injected and created a keen interest for theatre among the people of Bihar. The conservative and orthodox society opened up slowly and started liberalizing their views about theatre and its actors-actresses. A large number of working women and school-college-going girls were allowed by their guardians and parents to participate actively in plays and they made their presence felt with their talents. Hundreds of boys and girls were trained by Satish Anand during these years. The quality and class of Kala Sangam’s play-productions established Kala Sangam as one of the leading theatre group of India. Patna became the one of the most theatre-active center of India in 70s, 80s and 1990s. Kala Sangam had organised its first theatre festival and first all India theatre Seminar in 1978. Kala Sangam presented its five plays, ''Andha Yug, Ashadh Ka Ek Din, Lahron Ke Rajhans, Ballabhpur Ki Roopkatha and Singhasan Khali Hai''. The subject of the All India theatre seminar was "Aaj Ka Natak Aur Rangmanch" (Today's Drama &amp; theatre) Mr. B.V Karanth, Dr. Pratibha Agarwal and Sachidanand Hiranand Vatsyayan were the guest speaker of this seminar. 2nd Kala Sangam's Theatre festival and All India theatre Seminar was organised in 1979. Scholar theatre critic  Nemi Chand Jain, Dhyaneshwar Nadkarni  had participated in the seminar and also witnessed plays presented in the festival. Kala Sangam had organised its nine theatre festivals from 1978 to 1995 respectively. Kala Sangam’s work had inspired many people in Bihar to start theatrical activities in their respective places.
In 1984 Satish Anand evolved a new theatre idiom 'BIDESIA STYLE' for Modern Indian theatre by using indigenous traditional folk theatre elements. Satish Anand started his research. Conceptualized the form and finalized its Format. Evolved a new Theatrical Idiom for Modern Indian Theatre ‘BIDESIA’ based on Lesser-Known Traditional Theatrical Folk Forms of Bihar, LAUNDA NAACH &amp; NAACH PARTIES (With Special reference to Bhikhari Thakur’s Naach Party), Traditional Songs, Traditional Music, Traditional Dances, Folk Culture, Life-Cycle, Rituals, Customs, Faith &amp; Belief, Life styles, Habits, Behavior, Festivals &amp; Celebrations etc. of Bihar. Format of BIDESIA style consists of Theatrical elements, chosen very carefully from above &amp; creatively used in this style with contemporary &amp; modern sensibility. Bidesia style is a new Theatrical Idiom (Rang Bhasha) of Modern Indian Theatre which works as a Bridge between Rural &amp; Urban Theatre. Initially short stories written by Phanishwar Nath 'Renu', short stories by Mandhkar Gangadhar were read but at last one day a short story 'Amli' which was published in "Sarika" Hindi magazine was selected. Renowned Hindi Writer Kamleshwar was its Editor. Satish Anand liked that story and started work on it. He completely rearranged the incidents and sequences, created new characters, incidents and situations according to the thought format of Bidesia style. Bhojpri dialect was used in the play. Traditional music, songs &amp; their tunes were selected according to the conflict, mood, feelings of the characters and situations. Best part of that Every actor of Kala Sangam contributed his knowledge and experience in Adaptation of a short story ‘AMALI’, Adaptation of a Shudraka's Sanskrit play ‘MARICHCHHAKATIKA’(Mati Gari) and Phanishwar Natn's Hindi Novel ‘MAILA ANCHAL in Bidesia Style. And in 1994, a new play Rabindranath Tagore’s ‘MUKTADHARA’ Produced &amp; presented in BIDESIA style. Kala Sangam also toured Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bhubaneshwar, Bhopal, Ujjain, Guwahati, Kota, Jaipur,  Jodhpur, Bikaner, Hanuman Garh, Ganga Nager, Lucknow, Allahabad etc. with its plays. All these plays had been presented very successfully in  various Zonal &amp; National Folk Theatre Festivals organized in different  parts of India respectively. This Bidesia style had been recognized by Theatre Practitioners and Theatre Critics &amp; appreciated by audience throughout the country. Fascinating part is that this style has also influenced Modern Indian Theatre. Kala Sangam had staged Muktadhara in Bidesia Style in Bharangam, Delhi  in 2000.

[[Kolkata]]-based, [[Shyamanand Jalan]] (1934–2010) is credited for the renaissance period of modern [[Indian theatre]] and especially the Hindi theatre in Kolkata from the 1960s to the 1980s. He was the first to perform modernist [[Mohan Rakesh]], starting with his magnum opus ''[[Ashadh Ka Ek Din]]'' (One Day in Ashad) in 1960 and in the coming years bridged the gap between Hindi theatre and [[Bengali theatre]], by mounting Hindi productions of works by Bengali playwrights, like [[Badal Sircar]]'s ''Evam Indrajit'' (1968) and ''Pagla Ghora'' (1971), which in turn introduced Sircar to rest of the country. He co-founded theatre group ''Anamika'' in 1955 with Pratibha Aggarwal, a Hindi writer and a great granddaughter of [[Bhartendu Harishchandra]], which played a pioneering role in the revival of Hindi theatre.,&lt;ref name=kas&gt;{{cite book |title=Pop culture India!: media, arts, and lifestyle |author=Asha Kasbekar |authorlink= |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2006|isbn=978-1-85109-636-7 |page=73 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sv7Uk0UcdM8C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=%22Shyamanand+Jalan%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PtN0TfiZL8XjrAejtYDSCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Shyamanand%20Jalan%22&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained with it till 1972, and during this period it created a large audience for Hindi theatre in Bengali speaking Kolkata. Subsequently along with his wife Chetana Jalan, the well-known Kathak dancer and stage actress, and actor [[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]], he left Anamika in 1971 and established ''[[Padatik (Indian theatre group)|Padatik]]'' (literally foot-soldier) theatre group in 1972, of which he was the founding director. This gave him a chance to venture into bolder themes, like those in Vijay Tendukar's plays like ''Gidhade'' (The Vultures) (1973) and ''Sakharam Binder'' (1979), and [[Mahashweta Devi]]'s ''Hazar Chaurasi Ki Ma'' (Mother of 1084) (1978), with his new venture he stepped beyond Indianism, modernism, or experimentalism.&lt;ref name=hin&gt;{{cite news |title=Remembering Jalan |url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/theatre/article446583.ece |publisher= The Hindu|date=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Between theater &amp; anthropology|author= Richard Schechner|authorlink=Richard Schechner|year=1985 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=978-0-8122-1225-9 |page=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2sHhxkq7bAC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=%22Shyamanand+Jalan%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PtN0TfiZL8XjrAejtYDSCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Shyamanand%20Jalan%22&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theatre director, who practiced Hindi theatre in Kolkata, which is largely Bengali speaking area was [[Usha Ganguly]] (b. 1945), who founded ''[[Rangakarmee]]'' theatre group  in 1976, known for its productions like ''Mahabhoj'', ''Rudali'', ''Court Martial'', and ''Antaryatra''.&lt;ref name=tri&gt;{{cite news |title=Using theatre to voice her deepest concerns  |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040920/cth2.htm#6 |publisher=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] |date=20 September 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cal&gt;{{cite news|title=Calcutta, home to Hindi Theatre |url=http://www.cscsarchive.org:8081/MediaArchive/advertise.nsf/%28docid%29/70B426B140A9AA74652569420029534A |publisher=The Hindu |date=29 October 1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725211658/http://www.cscsarchive.org:8081/MediaArchive/advertise.nsf/%28docid%29/70B426B140A9AA74652569420029534A |archivedate=25 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from her, theatre directors like, [[Satyadev Dubey]], [[Dinesh Thakur]] and [[Nadira Babbar]] also practiced Hindi theatre in Mumbai, till then home for Marathi and Gujarati theatre.

In the 1960s and 70s, many actors from National School of Drama started working in Hindi films, though many continued theatre activities on the side. Many theatre actors and directors, like Om Shivpuri, who had formed ''Dishantar'' theatre group in Mumbai, and Dina Pathak worked successful in mainstream cinema as well, while many others, along with [[FTII, Pune]] actors, made name in the [[Parallel cinema]], which came of age in the late 1970s. This included, Sai Paranjpye, Om Puri, Naseeruddin Shah and Pankaj Kapoor. Most colleges now had their own theatre societies, which became breeding ground for future practitioners. Later in the 1980s, with increasing popularity of television soap operas, home videos and cable TV, audience moved away from theatre for a while, before theatre resurrected itself in the late 1990s with a new breed of theatre directors who sought not just new themes and narratives, but also took to [[absurd theatre|absurd]], [[Expressionist theater|expressionist]], [[Experimental theatre|experimental]] and [[improvisational theatre]] with greater zeal. They also started to find sponsors in the corporate sector and numerous theatre directors were able to sustain themselves on theatre alone. Two challenges that came up in the coming years was that even now actors took their theatre careers as a prep for film careers, and secondly most theatre actors learned via working in theatre groups, as avenues of theatre education remained limited, though some organisation that opened in other cities beyond Delhi, like Jaipur, Lucknow, and Chandigarh, which had playwright-director [[Balwant Gargi]] guiding new phase of theatre, offered young aspirants to learn the craft.&lt;ref name=Ru189/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch|Chambers, p. 383]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindi playwriting==
Bhartendu's father wrote a play titled, ''Nahul natak'' in 1859, which is the "first Hindi drama of literary scope in the modern period", though there is little record of its staging. The first drama to be staged was Shital Prasad Trivedi's ''Janaki mangal'' at Banaras theatre, also known as ''purana nachghar'', in 1868, in which Bhartendu himself made his stage debut as an actor, and in the coming years he wrote prolifically wrote eighteen plays till his death in 1885.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Pre-Bhartendu period, had created mostly mythological and epic inspired plays like, ''Hanuman-natak'', ''Amasya sar natak'', ''Vichitra natak'', ''Shakuntala upakhyan'', ''Anand Raghunandan'' and ''Inder sabha''.&lt;ref name=am/&gt;

Just as Bhartendu Harishchandra wrote ''Satya Harishchandra'' (1875), ''Bharat Durdasha'' (1876) and ''Andher Nagari'' (1878), in the late 19th century, [[Jaishankar Prasad]] became the next big figure in Hindi playwriting with plays like ''Skanda Gupta'' (1928), ''Chandragupta'' (1931) and ''Dhruvswamini'' (1933), [[Maithili Sharan Gupt]] also wrote three plays, ''Tilottama'' (1916), ''Chandrahaas'' (1921) and ''Anagha'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dm|Dimitrova, p. 15]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Datta, p. 1075"&gt;[[#Da|Datta, p. 1075]]&lt;/ref&gt; The next phase of important plays after Prasad, came with Badrinath Bhatt, next it was Lakshminarayan Mishra's work which broke away from existing pattern of subject treatment and presentation and is known for its realism, and unmistakable influence of Ibsen as seen in ''Sansyasi'' (1931), ''Raksha Ka Mandir'' (1931), ''Mukti ka rahasya'' (1932), ''Rajyoga'' (1934) and ''Sindoor ki Holi'' (1934), which tackle social problem with marked directness. An important event in this period was establishment of ''Hans'', a literary magazine based in Varanasi, by noted writer [[Premchand]] in 1938, which published numerous important one-act plays in the coming years, further giving boost to the craft.&lt;ref name="Datta, p. 1076"/&gt;

===1940s and beyond===
As the Independence struggle was gathering steam playwrights broaching issues of nationalism and subversive ideas against the British, yet to dodge censorship, they adapted themes from mythology, history and legend and used them as vehicle for political messages, a trend that continues to date, though now it was employed to bring out social, personal and psychological issues rather than clearly political.

Post-independence the emerging republic threw up new issues for playwrights to tackle and express, and Hindi playwriting showed greater brevity and symbolism, but it was not as prolific as in case with [[Hindi poetry]] or fiction.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Na|Nagendra, p. 661]]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet we have playwrights like [[Jagdish Chandra Mathur]] (''Konark'') and Upendranath Ashk (''Anjo Didi''), who displayed a steadily evolving understanding of thematic development, [[theatrical constraints]] and [[stagecraft]], and Gyandev Agnihotri stood out for his symbolism, wit and satire as visible in classic ''Shuturmurg'' written in the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=When politics meets entertainment|url=http://beta.mid-day.com/whatson/2010/mar/040310-Gyandev-Agnihotri-Shuturmurgh-Drama.htm |publisher=[[MiD DAY]] |date=4 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before moving into screenwriting for [[Hindi films]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Datta, p. 1075"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Datta, p. 1076"&gt;[[#Da|Datta, p. 1076]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|1088936|Gyandev Agnihotri}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Na|Nagendra, p. 645]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first important play of the 20th century was ''[[Andha Yug]]'' (The Blind Epoch), by [[Dharamvir Bharati]], which came in 1953, found in ''Mahabharat'', both an ideal source and expression of modern discontent and predicament of a society riddled with corruption. Starting with [[Ebrahim Alkazi]] it was staged by numerous directors. With his verse play ''Uttar Priyadarshini'', [[Agyeya]] found the story [[Ashoka]]'s redemption, reflecting the modern call for peace.&lt;ref name="Datta, p. 1076" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ru|Rubin, p. 195]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ashadh Ka Ek Din]]'' (One Day in Ashadh), the debut play of modernist [[Mohan Rakesh]] was published in 1958, based on the life of  [[Sanskrit]] dramatist [[Kālidāsa|Kalidas]], and is considered the first Modern Hindi play.&lt;ref name=com&gt;[[#Co|Cody, p. 1116]]&lt;/ref&gt; Mohan Rakesh went on to write two more plays, ''Aadhe Adhure'' (Halfway House) and ''Leheron Ke Raj Hans'' (Great Swans of the Waves) and left one, ''Paon Taley Ki Zameen'' (Ground beneath the Feet) unfinished by the time of his death in 1972, but he had shifted the landscape of Hindi theatre.&lt;ref name=com/&gt; Today, his rise as a prominent playwright in the 1960s is seen as the coming of age of Modern Indian playwriting in [[Hindi language|Hindi]], just as [[Vijay Tendulkar]] did it in Marathi, [[Badal Sircar]] in Bengali, and [[Girish Karnad]] in Kannada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Drama between the lines|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/drama-between-the-lines/190990/0 |publisher=[[The Financial Express (India)|Financial Express]] |date=28 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His plays have now become classics of Indian theatre, have been performed by almost every major Indian theatre director and have been part of the University curriculum in Hindi-speaking areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ru|Rubin, p. 196]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially inspired by western [[dramaturgy]], in structure and movement, many initial playwrights adapted [[Ibsen]] and [[Brecht]], but soon returned to roots and found both content and form, giving birth to the movement called "theatre of the roots", a concerted attempt to 'decolonise' Indian theatre and distance itself from western theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ru|Rubin, 183]]&lt;/ref&gt; Be it Habib Tanvir's ''Agra Bazar'' (1954) and ''Charandas Chor'' (1975), which brought in new indigenous forms of expression,&lt;ref name=cohab&gt;[[#Co|Cody, p. 1329]]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there were younger playwrights like [[Surendra Verma]], with his ''Surya Ki Antim Kiran Se Surya Ki Pahli Kiran Tak'' (From Sunset to Sunrise, 1972), ''Draupadi'' and ''Athwan sarga'' (Eighth Chapter, 1976), rapidly experimented with forms and formats,&lt;ref name="Datta, p. 1076" /&gt; and writers who ventured into playwrighting to produce important works, like [[Bhisham Sahni]] who has been associated with both IPTA and Progressive Writers Association, most noted for his [[partition of India|partition]]-novel ''Tamas'' wrote, ''Hanush'' (1977), ''Madhavi'' (1982) and ''Muavze'' (1993).

Over the years the repertoire of Hindi plays has expanded to include translated and adapted works of successful playwrights from other languages, like [[Vijay Tendulkar]], [[Girish Karnad]], [[Mahesh Elkunchwar]], [[Govind Purushottam Deshpande|G. P. Deshpande]] and [[Badal Sircar]] (Evam Indrajit, 1963, ''Pagla Ghoda'', 1967).&lt;ref name=am&gt;[[#Da|Datta, p. 1074]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Danish Iqbal's ''Dara Shikoh'' is a modern classic which was staged by director [[M S Sathyu]]. In the words of noted critic Ramesh Chand Charlie Dara Shikoh is a turning point of traditional theatrical sensibilities. Use of Wali Deccani's period poetry provides this Play with a very rare artistic and historical context. Dazzling use of Kathak choreography by ''Rani Khanum'' and her Troupe, and authentic costumes including head gear, swords and period art work was a treat for the eyes. This Play had a good run at cities like Delhi, Gurgaon and Banglore.

Another notable Drama of Danish Iqbal is ''Dilli jo ek Shehr Thaa'' depicts the life and times of a Delhi lost during the invasion of [[Nadir Shah]]. He was awarded ''Mohan Rakesh Samman'' for this Play by the Chief Minister of Delhi [[Sheila Dikshit]]. Recently this Play was staged by Bharti Sharma of Kshitij Group and had Delhi audience mesmerised by its production values and grandeur.

Danish also wrote ''Sahir''' on the life and times of [[Sahir Ludhyanvi]] which was staged in Delhi for a packed audience and became a landmark production for the use of old film songs as part of Dramatic Narrative. Directed by NRI Director ''Pramila Le Hunt'' this play became a commercial success and had audience wishing more and more of Sahir. Danish Iqbal also wrote ''Kuchh Ishq Kiya Kuchh Kaam'' on the life and work of legendary poet [[Faiz Ahmed Faiz]] and ''Sarah Ka Sara Aasman'' on the poet ''Sarah Shagufta'', besides the biographical Drama 'Ghalib' which used [[Ghalib]]'s poetry for the basic narrative and was staged at Dubai for the expatriate Indian Community. Danish had also given the block buster 'Woh Akhiri Hichki' and 'Ek Thi Amrita'(on the life and times of [[Amrita Pritam]]) and some other early works. In recent years he has been using lot of elements of Cinema and mass media to bring theatrical sensibilities closer to the audiences fed with lot of Bollywood. It is a pity that his collected work is not available till now although few versions of 'Dara Shikoh' and 'Ghalib' are available but Dara Shikoh being a costly historical costume Drama it is not easy to stage such a demanding production. 'Dilli Jo Ek Shehr Thaa' has all the markings of a classic stage play combining high voltage conflict with realistic characterisations, treacherous conspiracies, romance, poetry, dances and catchy dialogues.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Sayeed Alam is known for his wit and humour and more particularly for Plays like 'Ghalib in New Delhi' 'Big B' and many other gems which are regularly staged for massive turn out of theatre lovers. Maulana Azad is his magnum opus both for its content and style.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Shahid's 'Three B' is also a significant Play. He has been associated with many groups like 'Natwa' and others. Zaheer Anwar has kept the flag of Theatre flying in Kolkata. Unlike the writers of previous generation Sayeed, Shahid, Danish and Zaheer do not write bookish Plays but their work is a product of vigorous performing tradition.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Theatre criticism==

On the other hand, [[theatre criticism]] which had also begun with Bhartendu, saw new voices emerging in the mid-20th century, like Lakshmi Narayan Lal, which were now subjecting recent Indian playwriting to touchstone of Ibsen and other western masters.&lt;ref name="Datta, p. 1076"/&gt; Leading theatre critics were now employed by national dailies, this included Ramesh Chander and Nemichand Jain, and soon a second generation theatre criticism came to the fore in the 1960s, with Kavita Nagpal, Jaidev Taneja, and others. Literary journal also started having sections devoted to theatre criticism and many magazines now ran theatre review columns. In this period, a theatre journal ''Natrang'' edited by NC Jain started publishing, similar journal were brought out by state-run academies like, ''Sangit Natak'' by [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]] in Delhi, ''Rangyog'' at Rajasthan Academy in Jodhpur, and ''Chhayanat'' by Uttar Pradesh Academy in Lucknow. Another important development was the rise of documentation, academic research in various streams of Indian theatre by increasing number of theatre scholars, like [[Kapila Vatsyayan]], Anuradha Kapoor and N C Jain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ru|Rubin, p. 217]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History''' is one of the three main genres in Western theatre alongside [[tragedy]] and [[comedy]], although it originated, in its modern form, thousands of years later than the other primary genres.&lt;ref&gt;Ostovich, Helen, Mary V. Silcox, Graham Roebuck (eds).  ‘’Other Voices, Other Views: Expanding the Canon in English Renaissance Studies.’’ Dover: University of Delaware Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, it is often treated as a subset of tragedy.&lt;ref name=moarribner&gt;{{cite journal| title = Marlowe's Edward II and the Tudor History Play| first= Irving| last = Ribner | journal = ELH| volume =  22| number = 4 | date = Dec 1955| pages =  243–253| jstor = 2871887}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A play in this genre is known as a '''history play''' and is based on a [[Narrative history|historical narrative]], often set in the medieval or early modern past. History emerged as a distinct genre from tragedy in [[English Renaissance theatre|Renaissance England]].&lt;ref name=ribner&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0LHz_Eki_IC&amp;pg=PR9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The English History Play in the Age of Shakespeare|author=Irving Ribner |accessdate=2014-08-07|isbn=9780415353144|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best known examples of the genre are the [[Shakespearean history|history plays]] written by [[William Shakespeare]], whose plays still serve to define the genre. History plays also appear elsewhere in British and Western literature, such as [[Thomas Heywood]]'s ''[[Edward IV (play)|Edward IV]]'', Schiller's ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]]'' or the Dutch genre ''[[Gijsbrecht van Aemstel (play)|Gijsbrecht van Aemstel]]''.

Plays with some connection to historic narratives date to the beginnings of Athenian theatre. For one, although many early Greek plays covered subjects that modern audiences consider myth (rather than history), the Greeks did not make such a distinction, incorporating their stories of their gods into the same overarching narrative that included stories of their kings.&lt;ref name=Prinz&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3063835|jstor=3063835|title=Myth and History|author=George Huxley|journal=The Classical Review|volume=New Series, Vol. 31|issue= 2 |date=1981|pages= 225–227|doi-broken-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the earliest surviving work of theatre, ''[[The Persians]]'' records an event that was entirely historical, even under the modern understanding of history.&lt;ref name=Goldhill&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/632642 | title=Battle Narrative and Politics in Aeschylus' Persae | journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies | date=1988 | volume=108 | pages=189–193 | first=Simon | last=Goldhill| jstor=632642 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A key difference between ''The Persians'' and a history play in the modern sense is the incorporation of supernatural elements into the narrative of the Salamis. Additionally, it primarily dramatizes the Persian reaction to the battle, information that would have been at best a secondary concern for the Greek historian. Thus, although it concerns a verifiable historic event, it differs substantially from the modern genre of "history plays" in that it doesn't conform to the modern understanding of history (by presenting unvarifiable supernatural elements as fact) and in that its goals didn't entirely parallel those of ancient Greek historians.&lt;ref name=Goldhill /&gt;

A significant development in the evolution of the history play occurred during the Middle Ages with the rise of mystery plays. Theatre in the Middle Ages arose from traditions surrounding the mass, a ritual that, due to the orthodox theological position that the eucharistic sacrifice reenacts (and even recreates) the sacrifice on the cross, has profound similarities to theatre (and to the types of rituals that gave rise to theatre in ancient Athens). While the regular Sunday liturgy was like theatre, the traditions that evolved around the Easter service ''were'' theatre. Specifically the "[[Quem quaeritis?]]", explicitly involved the portrayal of characters by the priest and the acolyte.

With this as a starting point, medieval theatre makers began crafting other plays detailing the religious narratives of Christianity. Plays about saints, especially local saints, were particularly popular in England. These plays conformed to the goals of contemporary historians, often closely paralleling "Lives of the Saints" books. They are generally not included in the modern understanding of history plays, however, because they differ significantly from the modern understanding of history by unquestioningly including supernatural phenomena as key elements. The final step in the origin of the modern history play, therefore, would require, as a prerequisit, the evolution of the modern understanding of history.&lt;ref name=Griffin&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1556163 | title=The Birth of the History Play: Saint, Sacrifice, and Reformation | journal=Studies in English Literature, 1500-1900 | date=1999 | volume=39 | issue=2 | pages=217–237 | first=Benjamin | last=Griffin| jstor=1556163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Modern Origins==
The history play first took its modern form in Tudor England.  Literary scholar Irving Ribner, in his influential study of the genre, connects the emergence of the history play with "a new birth of historical writing in England"&lt;ref&gt;Ribner, Irving.  The English History Play in the Age of Shakespeare, Revised 2nd Edition London: Methuen,1965. Pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; during the sisteenth century, which included new books of English history written by [[Polydore Vergil]] (1534), [[Edward Hall]] (1543), and [[Raphael Holinshed]] (1577), among others.&lt;ref&gt;Ribner, Irving.  The English History Play in the Age of Shakespeare, Revised 2nd Edition London: Methuen,1965. Pg. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  While this trend of increasing historical literature has its roots in late Medieval England, it reached a new level of intensity after the ascension of Henry VII with the perceived need to show the justification of the Tudor's position in the monarchy. The motivations of renaissance playwrights generally coincided with those of renaissance historians, so, although England produced many historical works during the Middle Ages, these works were almost completely ignored in favor of more recent historical narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Ribner, Irving.  The English History Play in the Age of Shakespeare, Revised 2nd Edition London: Methuen,1965. Pg. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a more recent scholarly work, Ralph Hertel links the performative nature of the history play with a growing sense of English national identity under the early Tudors.  "Englishness," in his words, is “considered as something brought forth by the spectators who participate in the theatre event by becoming eye witnesess of sorts of the events staged and who engage in the Englishness displayed theatrically."&lt;ref&gt;Hertel, Ralf.  ''Staging England in the Elizabethan History Play: Performing National Identity''.  Surrey, England: Ashgate, 2014. Pg 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early examples of Tudor history plays include John Skelton's ''Magnyfycence'' (1519).  In this work, characters are named in the traditional fashion of a medieval morality play, with the lead named "Magnificance" and primary adversaries bearing names such as "Folly". Through the plot line and the characters' relationships with each other, however, Skelton assures that his contemporaries in the audience will easily recognize the identities of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] in the title character and Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]] in Folly. John Bale's ''[[Kynge Johan]]'', written 1538, takes another significant step toward the emergence of the secular history play by specifically naming the historic figures associated with his allegorically named characters.&lt;ref name=ribner /&gt;

[[File:Edwardiiquarto.gif|thumb|Title page of the earliest published text of Edward II (1594)]]
Later in the century, Christoper Marlowe's ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'' (1592) was profoundly influential in the development of the history play. While earlier English history plays tried to incorporate as much information as possible from their sources, Marlowe focused on the events that would contribute to his play from a storytelling perspective. In doing so, he not only provided the link between history and tragedy which would be elemental to later English Renaissance history plays but also set a new standard for effective use of the history play as propaganda.&lt;ref name=mills&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/388118|jstor=434180|title=The Meaning of 'Edward II'|author=L. J. Mills|journal=Modern Philology|volume= 32|issue= 1 |date=Aug 1934|pages= 11–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the history play evolved in England in a time when theatre in general was often viewed with suspicion, it was held up, even among theatre's critics, as an example of what could be valuable in the art form.&lt;ref name=howard /&gt; A significant factor in the favorable treatment that history plays received was the social function that commentators of the time believed that plays of this genre provided. For Thomas Nash and Thomas Heywood, for example, the English history play immortalized English heroes of the past and created a sense of national pride in audiences.&lt;ref name=howard /&gt; Generally speaking, history plays sought to accomplish the goals of historians using the dramatic medium.&lt;ref name=moarribner /&gt; In the case of playwrights in Renaissance England, this often amounted to historical propaganda in theatrical form.&lt;ref name=wells&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00138388508598404 | title=The Fortunes of Tillyard: Twentieth‐century critical debate on Shakespeare's history plays | journal=English Studies | date=1985 | volume=66 | issue=5 | pages=391–403 | first=Robin Headlam | last=Wells}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In assessing the past hundred years of literary scholarship on this English history play, Brian Walsh writes that "the center of gravity for work on the history play has remained the political arena.  With few exceptions, scholars have tended to focus on the genres topical relevance for Elizabethan and Jacobean questions of national identity, kingly authority, and the interpellation of subjects.  The focus has yielded a number of persuasive links between theatrical representation, the domestic and international expansion of state power, and the very day operation of Elizabeth’s and James’s governments."&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Brian.  ''Shakespeare, The Queen’s Men, and the Elizabethan Performance of History''.  Cambridge: Cambridge University, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to those written by Shakespeare, other early modern history plays include [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]]'s [[Perkin Warbeck (play)|''Perkin Warbeck'']], and the anonymous plays [[Edward III (play)|Edward III]], [[Thomas of Woodstock (play) |''Thomas of Woodstock'']], and [[Sir Thomas More (play)|''Sir Thomas More'']].

==Shakespeare==
{{Main|Shakespearean history}}
[[File:C. Kean as Richard III.jpg|thumb|Charles Kean as Richard III]]
In the [[First Folio]], the plays of [[William Shakespeare]] were grouped into three categories: [[Shakespearean comedies|comedies]], histories, and [[Shakespearean tragedy|tragedies]].  The histories—along with those of contemporary Renaissance playwrights—help define the genre of history plays.&lt;ref name="howard"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkDccFRob5IC&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Other Voices, Other Views: Expanding the Canon in English Renaissance Studies |accessdate=2014-08-07|isbn=978-0-87413-680-7 |last1=Ostovich |first1=Helen |last2=Silcox |first2=Mary V |last3=Roebuck |first3=Graham |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare's Histories might be more accurately called the "[[List of the monarchs of the Kingdom of England|English history]] plays." These plays dramatize historical events from English history as early as the reign of ''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]'' and as late as ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]''. In addition to these two, Shakespeare wrote eight plays covering the continuous period of history between the reigns of Richard II and Richard III. The so-called first tetralogy, apparently written in the early 1590s, deals with the later part of the struggle and includes ''[[Henry VI, Part 1|Henry VI, parts one]]'', ''[[Henry VI, Part 2|two]]'' &amp; ''[[Henry VI, Part 3|three]]'' and ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''. The second tetralogy, finished in 1599 and including ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'', ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'' and ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', is frequently called the ''[[Henriad]]'' after its protagonist [[Prince Hal]], the future [[Henry V of England|Henry V]].

Shakespeare himself alludes to the recognition of history as an established theatrical genre in ''[[Hamlet]]'' when Polonius announces the arrival of "the best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history...".&lt;ref name=Hattaway&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PLUcb-NK644C&amp;pg=PR9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare's History Plays  |accessdate=2014-08-07|isbn=9780521775397  |author1=Hattaway  |first1=Michael  |date=2002-12-05  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Several other of Shakespeare's other plays listed as tragedies in the First Folio, however, could be classified as history plays according to a broader, more generalized definition. Plays such as ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', and ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' depict historical events from classical antiquity, for example, while ''[[King Lear]]'' and ''[[Cymbeline]]'' dramatize the history of ancient Britain and ''[[Macbeth]]'' depicts the historical events not of medieval England but rather of medieval Scotland.

A consistent theme in historical drama of both Shakespeare and his English contemporaries revolves around questions of who had legitimate claim to participate in the affairs of the state. Shakespeare's history plays are considered the defining works of the genre. Later playwrights of history plays would either follow his stylistic model or at least have an acute awareness of their stylistic differences with Shakespearean histories.&lt;ref name=ribner /&gt;

==Restoration and Eighteenth Century==
Following the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], the English History as a genre lost much of the momentum that they had gained during the Tudor and Stuart eras. Even the most esteemed genre of English Renaissance theatre, tragedy (to which the history genre had been closely tied from the beginning), had fallen out of style in favor of tragicomedy and comedy.&lt;ref name=Maguire&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mDNJOl2IK7MC&amp;pg=PR11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Regicide and Restoration: English Tragicomedy, 1660-1671 |author= Nancy Klein Maguire |accessdate=2014-08-07|isbn=9780521416221 |year=1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, English playwrights produced numerous plays depicting historical events outside of England including [[William Davenant]]'s ''[[The Siege of Rhodes]]'', [[John Dryden]]'s ''[[The Indian Queen (play)|The Indian Queen]]'' and ''The Indian Emperor'', [[Elkanah Settle]]'s ''The Empress of Morocco''.

Productions of history plays often had an intentionally revivalist character.&lt;ref name=ribner /&gt; For example, adaptations of Shakespeare's plays, including his histories, were extremely popular.&lt;ref name=dickinson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inside.fdu.edu/fdupress/07090401.html |title=Shakespeare Adaptations from the Restoration: Five Plays |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University|date= |accessdate=2014-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eighteenth century, [[Joseph Addison]]'s neo-classical ''[[Cato, a Tragedy]]'' could be classified as a history play according to the same broad, generalized definition that would apply to Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar''.

==In Contemporary Theatre==
Popular recently authored history plays include James Goldman's ''[[The Lion in Winter]]''. Criticized as ahistorical it tests the boundaries of the genre, while also poking fun at its conventions. Although, in many respects it has more in common with absurdist comic domestic drama, it retains an essentially historic core. George Bernard Shaw's ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'' has received widespread praise,&lt;ref name=macksound&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00335637109383054 | title= Voices in opposition: A Burkeian rhetoric of Saint Joan | journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech | date=1971 | volume=57 | issue=2 | pages=140–146 | first=S. John | last=Macksoud}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has even been compared favorably to Shakespeare's histories.&lt;ref name=boas&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2866725 | title=Joan of Arc in Shakespeare, Schiller, and Shaw | journal=Shakespeare Quarterly | date=1951 | volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=35–45 | first=Frederick S. | last=Boas| jstor=2866725 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The temporal boundary of history plays is tested in ''[[Stuff Happens]]'' by David Hare, which chronicles the events leading up to the [[Iraq War]] with only two years separating the author from his subject. The play focuses heavily on the use of exact quotes, with all public speeches given by the main characters being taken word for word from actual quotes.&lt;ref name=wessendorf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.hawaii.edu/~wessendo/Post911Drama.htm |accessdate=May 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101173744/http://www2.hawaii.edu/~wessendo/Post911Drama.htm |archivedate=January 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They offer services to more than 3,000 hotels in 40+ countries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  In March 2014, following Chapter 11 Bankruptcy proceedings, the company was purchased by rival [[Guest-tek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guest-tek Acquisition of iBAHN Takes Hotel Technology to a Higher Level|url=http://hospitalitytechnology.edgl.com/news/Guest-tek-Acquisition-of-iBAHN-Takes-Hotel-Technology-to-a-Higher-Level91762|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
iBAHN (originally called STSN, or Suite Technology Systems Network) was founded in February 1998 as an [[ISP]] focused on providing high-speed wired and wireless Internet service to hotels. Their first major client was Marriott Corporation, who signed a deal in 1999 to have STSN install high-speed Internet services in roughly 500 hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Plot==
{{Long plot|date=November 2018}}

Kaashmora ([[Karthi]]) and his family lived by cheating people in the name of black magic and dark spirits. One day, a PhD research student Yamini ([[Sri Divya]]) joins Kaashmora, only to gather evidence and expose him to the public. Kaashmora's fame brings him to a superstitious and fraudulent Minister ([[Sharath Lohitashwa]]). Kaashmora earns the Minister's trust. When income tax department raids the minister's house, he asks his henchmen to transfer all the illegal money to Kaashmora's house. Seeing this as an opportunity to escape and settle abroad, Kaashmora's family escapes with the money. Meanwhile, Chelapathy Rao, a Telugu man seeks Kaashmora's help and brings him to a haunted bungalow in Andhra Pradesh. In the bungalow, Kaashmora is haunted by real ghosts.

Back in Chennai, the Minister learns that Kaashmora is a fraud and sends his henchmen to kill his family. The henchmen try to get Kaashmora from the bungalow but are unable to do so as the ghost beats them all and drags Kaashmora and his family inside the bungalow. Inside, they meet with a broker who got trapped inside the bungalow for a long time. The broker says that the bungalow was once a princess's palace. Ever since her death, residents and owners of the bungalow had met with an ill-fated death. He also tells that there are 13 ghosts in the bungalow. The trapped people meet the ghost of Raj Nayak, the head of all the 12 ghosts. Rajnayak asks Kaashmora to help him and his 12 subordinates reach the spiritual world. He then locks them in the castle. That night, a young girl in Kaashmora's dream leads him to a locked door within the castle.

Waking up, Kaashmora follows the same route, but is stopped by Yamini, who reveals to him that Chelapathy Rao, the man who led him here, died 75 years ago and it was his ghost that led Kaashmora as well as Yamini to the bungalow. Kaashmora searches the castle and gets hold of an old book that dates back 700 years. Raj Nayak ([[Karthi]]) was a self-obsessed warlord and a womanizer. The King remained silent and didn't interfere with Rajnayak's growing atrocities because of his military prowess. One day, the princess Rathna Mahadevi ([[Nayanthara]]) elopes with her lover who is the enemy nation's prince. The King announces that he'll marry off Rathna and give away half of his kingdom to the man who finds her. Rajnayak kills the prince and forcibly brings Rathna back. He demands to be wedded to the princess, and wants the other half of the kingdom as dowry. When opposed, he kills the crown Prince and the King. He marries Rathna and coronates himself as the King. However, Rathna has other plans. She and her friends seduces Rajnayak and his subordinates. While his subordinates are burned alive, Rajnayak is beheaded by Rathna. However, he kills her before dying. Before breathing her last, Rathna places a curse on the 13 men, banishing them from reaching the spiritual world.

Ever since, Rajnayak and the other 12 ghosts had haunted the palace and its occupants. An exorcist once had predicted that Raj Nayak and the other ghosts would reach eternal power if they are able to sacrifice the lives of 5 people belonging to the same family with the same birth star (Rohini). The sacrifice should be performed by a lady who is the only woman in her generation. This should happen during the Navakaali Pournami that occurs once every 1000 years. Kaashmora recollects that his family members all have the same birth sign and that Yamini is the only woman in her family.

That night, Navakaali Pournami occurs and Rajnayak forces Kaashmora and his family to a guillotine. The young girl from Kaashmora's dream apparates and she turns out to be Rathna Mahadevi's reincarnation. While Rathna and Raj Nayak fight each other, Kaashmora fends off the subordinate ghosts with the help of a magical sword. Rathna's conscience leads him to a chamber within the castle where Rajnayak's remains are. Using the sword, Kaashmora destroys the remains, making Rajnayak vulnerable. Rathna destroys Raj Nayak's spirit and it goes to the underworld. The other spirits flee the castle to the spiritual world. Kaashmora and his family get out of the castle and he claims that he has destroyed the spirits and cleansed the centuries haunted bungalow. Kaashmora's family told the politician that the money stolen from the politician has been kept by the Ghost.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1814">The '''Kinoks''' ("kino-oki," meaning cinema-eyes) were a collective of Soviet filmmakers in 1920s Russia, based most notably around film editor [[Dziga Vertov]] (pseudonym Denis Kaufman).  In 1919 Vertov and his future wife, the talented film editor [[Elisaveta Svilova|Elizaveta Svilova]], plus several other young filmmakers created the group. In 1922 they were joined by [[Mikhail Kaufman]], who had just returned from the civil war. From 1922 to 1923 Vertov, Kaufman, and Svilova published a number of manifestos in avant-garde journals which clarified the Kinoks' positions vis-à-vis other leftist groups.

The Kinoks rejected "staged" cinema with its stars, plots, props and studio shooting. They insisted that the cinema of the future be the cinema of fact: newsreels recording the real world, "life caught unawares." Vertov proclaimed the primacy of camera ("Kino-Eye") over the human eye. The camera lens was a machine that could be perfected infinitely to grasp the world in its entirety and organize visual chaos into a coherent, objective picture. At the same time Vertov emphasized that his Kino-Eye principle was a method of "communist" deciphering of the world. Vertov considered [[Marxism]] the only objective and scientific tool of analysis and even called a series of the 23 newsreels he directed between 1922 and 1925 [[Kino-Pravda]], "pravda" being not only the Russian word for the truth but also the title of the official party newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070808211425/http://cours.cegep-st-jerome.qc.ca/511-411-p.l/vertov.htm |Dziga Vertov (1896-1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most acclaimed work is undoubtedly the seminal city symphony, ''[[Man with a Movie Camera]]'' (1929).

'''Ninja''' was a theme and product range of the construction toy [[Lego]]. Launched in 1998, the collection was its own theme. It had many elements of the ninja warriors from feudal Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lipkowitz | first = Daniel | title = The Lego Book | publisher = Dorling Kindersley | year = 2009 | page = 64 | isbn = 978-1-4053-4169-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the sets were released in 1998 and 1999, with only three small sets of [[minifigure]]s released in 2000 as part of the ‘Mini Heroes Collection’. After this, the theme was discontinued, and was effectively replaced by the “Knights Castle” theme from 2000 on-wards.

In 2011 Lego decided to release a new line called [[Lego Ninjago]] Masters of Spinjitzu, which uses elements from the previous Ninja series.

'''Neil Postman''' (March 8, 1931 – October 5, 2003) was an American author, educator, [[Media studies|media theorist]] and [[cultural critic]], who is best known for his twenty books&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;, including ''[[Amusing Ourselves to Death]]'' (1985), ''Conscientious Objections'' (1988), ''[[Technopoly|Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology]]'' (1992), ''The Disappearance of Childhood'' (1994) and ''The End of Education: Redefining the Value of School'' (1995). 

==Biography==
Postman was born in New York City, where he would spend most of his life.&lt;ref name="thevillager.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thevillager.com/villager_28/ateacherslife.html|title=A teacher's life: Remembering Neil Postman|work=''thevillager.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, he graduated from [[State University of New York at Fredonia]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Neil-Postman#ref1198654|title=Encyclopedia Britannica entry on D. Postman|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. At [[Teachers College, Columbia University]] he was awarded a master's degree in 1955 and an [[Doctor of Education|Ed.D]] (Doctor of Education) degree in 1958.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt; In 1959, he began teaching at [[New York University]] (NYU).&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;

In 1971, at NYU's [[Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development|Steinhardt School of Education]], he founded a graduate program in [[media ecology]].&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt; He became the School of Education's only University Professor in 1993, and was chairman of the Department of Culture and Communication until 2002&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;.

He died of lung cancer in [[Flushing, Queens]], on October 5, 2003.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;Wolfgang Saxon: [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/09/obituaries/09POST.html ''New York Times'' Obituary: Neil Postman, October 9, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Postman wrote 20 books and more than 200 magazine and newspaper articles for such periodicals as ''[[The New York Times|The New York Times Magazine]]'', ''[[The Atlantic|The Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'', ''[[Harvard Educational Review]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'', and ''[[Le Monde]]''. He was the editor of the quarterly journal ''[[Institute of General Semantics|ETC: A Review of General Semantics]]'' from 1976 to 1986. He was also a contributing editor at ''[[The Nation]]''. Despite his oft-quoted concerns about television, computers and the role of technology in society, Postman used not only books, but also the medium of television to advance his ideas. He sat for many television interviews and, later in life, even had cable television in his home&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?31627-1/technopoly|title=Technopoly|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1976, Postman taught a course for NYU credit on CBS-TV's ''[[Sunrise Semester]]'' called "Communication: the Invisible Environment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19760919&amp;id=aGRNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EfsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3453,5145996|title=Sunrise Semester begins 13th Season|date=September 19, 1976|work=Lakeland Ledger|accessdate=May 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On education==
In 1969 and 1970 Postman collaborated with [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]] educator [[Alan Shapiro (education reformer)|Alan Shapiro]] on the development of a model school based on the principles expressed in ''Teaching as a Subversive Activity''. The result was the "Program for Inquiry, Involvement, and Independent Study" within [[New Rochelle High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joshkarpf.com/3i/proposal1970.html|title=3I Program: Proposal, 1970|work=''joshkarpf.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "open school" experiment survived for 15 years, and in subsequent years many programs following these principles were developed in American high schools, current survivors include Walter Koral's Language class at the [[Village School (Great Neck, New York)|Village School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/12/education/12village.html | work=The New York Times | title=Profile Rises at School Where Going Against the Grain Is the Norm | first=Winnie | last=Hu | date=November 12, 2007 | accessdate=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Great Neck, New York]].

In a television interview conducted in 1995 on the ''[[MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour]]'', Postman spoke about his opposition to the use of personal computers in schools. He felt that school was a place to learn together as a cohesive group and that it should not be used for individualized learning. Postman also worried that the personal computer was going to take away from individuals socializing as citizens and human beings.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;From interview from PBS on ''MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Amusing Ourselves to Death'' ==
One of Postman's most influential works is ''[[Amusing Ourselves to Death|Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business]]''. In ''Amusing'', Postman argued that by expressing ideas through visual imagery, television reduces politics, news, history, and other serious topics to entertainment&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. He worried that culture would decline if the people became an audience and their public business a "vaudeville act." Postman also argued that television is destroying the "serious and rational public conversation" that was sustained for centuries by the printing press.

==''Technopoly''==
In his 1992 book ''[[Technopoly|Technopoly: the Surrender of Culture to Technology]]'', Postman defines "Technopoly" as a society which believes "the primary, if not the only, goal of human labor and thought is efficiency, that technical calculation is in all respects superior to human judgment ... and that the affairs of citizens are best guided and conducted by experts."

In an interview, Postman described ''Technopoly'' as being about the tendency of technology to be given cultural control of sovereign American social institutions&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Postman argues that the United States is the only country to have developed into a technopoly. He claims that the U.S. has been inundated with technophiles who do not see the downside of technology. This is dangerous because technophiles want more technology and thus more information. However, according to Postman, it is impossible for a technological innovation to have only a one-sided effect. With the ever-increasing amount of information available, Postman argues that: "Information has become a form of garbage, not only incapable of answering the most fundamental human questions but barely useful in providing coherent direction to the solution of even mundane problems."

Postman was not opposed to all forms of technology. In page 7 of ''Technopoly'', he agrees that technological advancements, specifically "the telephone, ocean liners, and the reign of hygiene," have lengthened and improved modern life. In his words, this agreement proves that he is not a "one-eyed technophobe."

In ''Technopoly'', Postman discusses [[Luddite|Luddism]], explaining that being a Luddite often is associated with a naive opposition to technology. But, according to Postman, historical Luddites were trying to preserve their way of life and rights given to them prior to the advancement of new technologies.

'''''#1 Single''''' is a reality-based show that aired on [[E!|E! Entertainment Television]] in the [[United States]]. The eight-segment program premiered on January 22, 2006 and ended its run on March 19, 2006. 

==Synopsis==
In this reality-based series, all of whose installments she narrated, singer-actress [[Lisa Loeb]] documented her life as a single woman in her mid-thirties as she attempted to re-enter the dating scene after two failed relationships, each of which had lasted six years. With the help of her sister [[Debbie Loeb|Debbie]] (who was also a singer-actress, and single as well), her longtime friend [[Stephanie Ittleson|Stephanie]], and ex-boyfriend Juan Patino, Lisa was given advice on how to find love.

But even as she pursued her Mr. Right, she also hoped that, when she did find him, she would finally achieve a goal that she had always dreamed of: having a family of her own. With her musical career and her pursuit of the perfect man causing a little friction in her life, Lisa hoped that she could balance the two in more ways than one.

==Events after the series ended==
The goal Loeb sought was not achieved as a result of ''Number 1 Single'', as the series of events it documented failed to lead to a long-term romance for her. On January 31, 2009, nearly three years after the series ended, Loeb married Roey Hershkovitz, the music coordinator for ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20256113,00.html Lisa Loeb is Married!] People.com, January 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/fashion/weddings/01loeb.html Weddings] New York Times Official Announcement&lt;/ref&gt; Loeb gave birth to a baby girl, Lyla Rose Loeb Hershkovitz, on November 29, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Marie Cruz, [http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20323566,00.html It's a Girl for Lisa Loeb] People.com, December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Scriven''' [[MBE]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?breif=true&amp;page=1&amp;search_type=advanced Peter Scriven honour]&lt;/ref&gt; (1930–1998) was the founding [[artistic director]] of the [[Marionette Theatre of Australia]].

==Background and legacy==
Scriven played a huge role in establishing [[puppetry]] as a serious artform in Australia.
His ''Tintookies'' and ''Little Fella Bindi'' toured all over Australasia. The Tintookies, from an Aboriginal word meaning 'little people who come from the sandhills', was an elaborate marionette musical first staged by creator Peter Scriven at the Elizabethan Theatre in Sydney in 1956. After the success of this production, Tintookie&lt;ref&gt;Billington, M, ''Performing Arts: A Guide To Practice And Appreciation'', p.161&lt;/ref&gt; became the generic name for any of the puppets used by the Marionette Theatre of Australia, formed by Scriven under the auspices of the [[Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust|Elizabethan Theatre Trust]] in 1965. The board was chaired by [[Howard Beale (politician)|Sir Howard Beale]], president of the Arts Council, and included [[H. C. Coombs|Dr H.C. Coombs]], Dorothy Helmrich and Scriven, who was also artistic director. Apart from commissioning and presenting original Australian puppet works, the Marionette Theatre of Australia was to establish a training school, encourage the development of other groups, and import overseas companies.&lt;ref name="Peter Scriven 3"&gt;[http://www.binaryblue.com.au/LPA/peterscriven3.html Peter Scriven 3&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marionette Theatre of Australia produced innovative large-scale puppet shows with an overtly Australian content for children for more than 20 years, including the landmark productions ''LittleFella Bindi'' (1958) and Norman Lindsay's ''The Magic Pudding'' (1960). ''Bindi'', the Aboriginal boy lead in ''LittleFella Bindi'' was manipulated by Scriven. He was supported by a team of five young puppeteers supervised by Igor Hyczka, a stage manager, a sound technician and a tour manager, [[Tony Gould (arts director)|Tony Gould]] (later to head the [[Queensland Performing Arts Centre]]).&lt;ref name="Peter Scriven 3"/&gt; Later productions included ''The Explorers'' (telling the story of Australian explorers, [[Burke and Wills expedition|Burke and Wills]]) and ''The Water Babies''. A film version of ''The Explorers'' was produced in 1968 by Scriven for Film World Pty. Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burkeandwills.net.au/Bibliography/Movies/films.htm Films&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scriven was highly dedicated even as a boy to marionettes. According to his teacher, William Dalziel Nicol, Scriven was one of the first students examined in puppetry after a course conducted by the Education Department in 1943 in Victoria, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150555b.htm Nicol, William Dalziel (Bill) (1907–1978) Biographical Entry – Australian Dictionary of Biography Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scriven was a remarkable entrepreneur&lt;ref&gt;Tredinnick, D, ''Tintookie Man, the Last of His Tribe: A Story of Peter Scriven Puppetry'', (Australasian Drama Studies – 1 October 2007''&lt;/ref&gt; and used his own funds to establish his marionette company. His legacy lives on the marionettes of the Marionette Theatre Company which a central part of the archives of the [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] in Sydney.
==Later years==
After a spell in Singapore and Malaysia, Scriven returned to Sydney in 1973 as puppetry
consultant to the [[Australia Council for the Arts]]. In late 1974 Scriven put together a new version of ''The Tintookies''. Utilising around 100 near life-size marionettes, this was the biggest puppet production ever undertaken in Australia. It premiered at the [[Princess Theatre, Melbourne|Princess Theatre]] in Melbourne on 8 January 1975 and toured Asia in early 1976.

Scriven's next home was Sri Lanka. He commissioned local puppeteers to make the marionettes for ''The Tintookie Man'', a small-scale show that he presented on an independent tour of Australian schools in 1976-7. When he left to live in the Philippines, the show was continued by Graeme Mathieson, an accomplished puppeteer with whom Scriven had worked at the MTA.

In 1974 Richard Bradshaw succeeded Scriven as artistic director of the Marionette Theatre of Australia. It became an autonomous body in 1979 and from 1983 had its own theatre in the Rocks. It closed in 1988 due to losing federal government funding.

Peter Scriven's services to theatre were acknowledged with an MBE in 1970. He spent his last years living in increasingly reduced circumstances in Manila, finally subsisting on just $5 a day. He worked on a play and an autobiography, but neither has been published. In 1998, diagnosed with a brain tumour, Scriven returned to Australia. He had been here just three weeks when, on 13 October 1998, he was found dead in a boarding house in Fortitude Valley, Brisbane. The man whose artistry had entertained countless thousands of Australian youngsters and had inspired a new generation of professional puppeteers had just $1.50 in his pocket. He was survived by many of his Tintookie marionettes, which now live in the archives of the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney.

Scriven's enthusiasm and expertise had legitimised Australian puppetry, transforming it from a children's party distraction into a major performing art form that attracts wide audiences and government funding and is taught in performing arts schools.

[[File:Seattle Custom Cabinets shop.jpg|Scenery shop.|right|thumb]]
A '''scenery shop''' or '''scene shop''' is a specialized workshop found in many medium or large theaters, as well as many educational theatre settings. The primary function of a scene shop is to fabricate and assemble the [[Flats (theatre)|flat]]s, [[Platform (theatre)|platforms]], [[scenery wagon]]s, and other scenic (set) pieces required for a performance. Commonly, a scene shop is also the location where most of the set painting is done, and is sometimes used to make [[Theatrical property|prop]]s. Generally, the individuals who work in a scene shop are [[carpenter]]s, although, in bigger shops, it is common for [[metalworker]]s to be employed for steel-construction set pieces which require [[welding]] and other [[machining]].  It is common for the individuals working in a scene shop to be knowledgeable in a wide variety of technical skills, developed over time as required for specific construction needs.

==Commercial shops==
Commercial scene shops can also be found in larger metropolitan areas, where they are capable of supplying scenic elements to a variety of clients, including [[theatre]], [[film]], television, and corporate productions. Scenic studios also sometimes make elements for museum booths, touring concerts, and other custom fabrication tasks.

==Shop construction==
Although many scene shops are located in general purpose building, most are in purpose built spaces because scenic fabrication has some fairly specific needs. Often they are in very large, open rooms, to accommodate big elements that a show may call for. They are usually attached directly to a loading dock for delivery of materials and shipping of finished elements. If they are attached to a performance venue, it is also common to have large doors providing access to the stage. Typically, compressed air and dust collection systems are distributed around the shop. Many processes in a scene shop such as spray painting, welding, or hot-wire foam cutting produce dangerous gasses, so often extra ventilation is installed. Ideally, fume collection systems are available to use near the actual workpiece. Power is usually available in floor pockets or dropped from the ceiling, in a variety of voltages, as some tools, especially welders require high voltages. Often, scene shops have designated areas inside for paints, carpentry, metalwork, and sometimes prop construction.

[[File:Frances Densmore recording Mountain Chief2.jpg|thumb|[[Frances Densmore]] recording [[Blackfoot]] chief [[Mountain Chief]] on a cylinder phonograph for the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]] (1916)]]

'''Sound recording and reproduction''' is an [[electrical]], [[Mechanical system|mechanical]], electronic, or digital inscription and re-creation of [[sound]] waves, such as spoken voice, singing, [[instrumental music]], or [[sound effect]]s. The two main classes of sound recording technology are [[analog recording]] and [[digital recording]]. 

Acoustic analog recording is achieved by a [[microphone diaphragm]] that senses changes in [[atmospheric pressure]] caused by [[acoustics|acoustic]] sound waves and records them as a mechanical representation of the sound waves on a medium such as a [[phonograph]] record (in which a stylus cuts grooves on a record).  In [[magnetic tape]] recording, the sound waves vibrate the microphone diaphragm and are converted into a varying [[electric current]], which is then converted to a varying [[magnetic field]] by an [[electromagnet]], which makes a representation of the sound as magnetized areas on a plastic tape with a magnetic coating on it. Analog sound reproduction is the reverse process, with a bigger [[loudspeaker diaphragm]] causing changes to atmospheric pressure to form acoustic sound waves.

Digital recording and reproduction converts the analog sound signal picked up by the microphone to a [[Digital audio|digital form]] by the process of [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]]. This lets the audio data be stored and [[Data transmission|transmitted]] by a wider variety of media.  Digital recording stores audio as a series of [[binary number]]s (zeros and ones) representing samples of the amplitude of the [[audio signal]] at equal time intervals, at a [[sample rate]] high enough to convey all sounds capable of being [[Hearing (sense)|heard]]. A [[digital audio]] signal must be reconverted to analog form during playback before it is [[power amplifier|amplified]] and connected to a [[loudspeaker]] to produce sound.

Prior to the development of sound recording, there were mechanical systems, such as wind-up [[music box]]es and, later, [[player piano]]s, for encoding and reproducing instrumental music.

==Pre-history==
{{See also|History of sound recording}}

Long before [[sound]] was first recorded, music was recorded—first by written [[music notation]], then also by mechanical devices (e.g., wind-up [[music box]]es, in which a mechanism turns a spindle, which plucks metal tines, thus reproducing a [[melody]]). Automatic music reproduction traces back as far as the 9th century, when the [[Banū Mūsā]] brothers invented the earliest known mechanical musical instrument, in this case, a [[hydropower]]ed (water-powered) [[Organ (music)|organ]] that played interchangeable cylinders. According to Charles B. Fowler, this "...cylinder with raised pins on the surface remained the basic device to produce and reproduce music mechanically until the second half of the nineteenth century." The Banū Mūsā brothers also invented an automatic [[flute]] player, which appears to have been the first [[programmable machine]].&lt;ref name="Fowler 45–49"&gt;{{citation|title=The Museum of Music: A History of Mechanical Instruments|first=Charles B.|last=Fowler|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=54|issue=2|date=October 1967|pages=45–49|doi=10.2307/3391092|publisher=MENC_ The National Association for Music Education|jstor=3391092}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koetsier&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koetsier |first1=Teun |year=2001 |title=On the prehistory of programmable machines: musical automata, looms, calculators |journal=Mechanism and Machine Theory |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=589–603 |publisher=Elsevier |doi=10.1016/S0094-114X(01)00005-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 14th century, a mechanical bell-ringer controlled by a rotating cylinder was introduced in [[Flanders]].{{cn|date=April 2018}} Similar designs appeared in [[barrel organ]]s (15th century), [[musical clock]]s (1598), [[barrel piano]]s (1805), and [[music box]]es (ca. 1800). A music box is an automatic [[musical instrument]] that produces sounds by the use of a set of pins placed on a revolving cylinder or disc so as to pluck the tuned teeth (or [[Lamellophone|''lamellae'']]) of a steel comb.

The [[fairground organ]], developed in 1892, used a system of accordion-folded punched cardboard books. The [[player piano]], first demonstrated in 1876, used a punched paper scroll that could store a long piece of music. The most sophisticated of the piano rolls were hand-played, meaning that the roll represented the actual performance of an individual, not just a transcription of the sheet music. This technology to record a live performance onto a piano roll was not developed until 1904. Piano rolls were in continuous mass production from 1896 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pianola.org/history/history_pianoplayers.cfm|title=The Pianola Institute - History of the Pianola - Piano Players|website=Pianola.org|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/incoming/article134934.ece|title=The day the music died - News - The Buffalo News|date=June 10, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=May 24, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610220347/http://www.buffalonews.com/incoming/article134934.ece|archivedate=June 10, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1908 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] copyright case noted that, in 1902 alone, there were between 70,000 and 75,000 player pianos manufactured, and between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 piano rolls produced.&lt;ref&gt;''[[White-Smith Music Publishing Company v.

The first device that could record actual [[sound]]s as they passed through the air (but could not play them back—the purpose was only visual study) was the [[phonautograph]], patented in 1857 by Parisian inventor [[Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville]]. The earliest known recordings of the human voice are phonautograph recordings, called ''phonautograms'', made in 1857.&lt;ref name="firstsounds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstsounds.org |title=First Sounds |website=FirstSounds.ORG |date=2008-03-27 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They consist of sheets of paper with sound-wave-modulated white lines created by a vibrating stylus that cut through a coating of soot as the paper was passed under it. An 1860 phonautogram of [[Au Clair de la Lune (song)|Au Clair de la Lune]], a French folk song, was played back as sound for the first time in 2008 by scanning it and using software to convert the undulating line, which graphically encoded the sound, into a corresponding digital audio file.&lt;ref name="firstsounds"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2008&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/27/arts/27soun.html|title=Researchers Play Tune Recorded Before Edison|author=Jody Rosen|date=March 27, 2008|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 1877, French poet, humorous writer and inventor [[Charles Cros]] submitted a sealed envelope containing a letter to the [[Academy of Sciences]] in Paris fully explaining his proposed method, called the paleophone.&lt;ref name="RBNF"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cairn.info/zen.php?ID_ARTICLE=RBNF_033_0020 |title=L'impression du son |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928231926/http://www.cairn.info/zen.php?ID_ARTICLE=RBNF_033_0020 |archive-date=2015-09-28 |work=Revue de la BNF |date=2009 |publisher=Bibliothèque nationale de France |isbn=9782717724301 |issue=33 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though no trace of a working paleophone was ever found, Cros is remembered{{by whom|date=October 2018}} as the earliest inventor of a sound recording and reproduction machine.{{cn|reason=Per [[Paleophone]], it appears the reason no machine was ever found was that none was ever built.

The first practical sound recording and reproduction device was the mechanical [[phonograph cylinder]], invented by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1877 and patented in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00200521&amp;idkey=NONE|title=Patent Images|website=patimg1.uspto.gov|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/edison-company-motion-pictures-and-sound-recordings/articles-and-essays/history-of-edison-sound-recordings/history-of-the-cylinder-phonograph/ |title=History of the Cylinder Phonograph |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention soon spread across the globe and over the next two decades the commercial recording, distribution, and sale of sound recordings became a growing new international industry, with the most popular titles selling millions of units by the early 1900s.{{cn|date=November 2018}} The development of mass-production techniques enabled cylinder recordings to become a major new consumer item in industrial countries and the cylinder was the main consumer format from the late 1880s until around 1910.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

The next major technical development was the invention of the [[gramophone record]], generally credited to [[Emile Berliner]] and commercially introduced in the United States in 1889, though others had demonstrated similar disk apparatus earlier, most notably [[Alexander Graham Bell]] in 1881.&lt;ref name=smiths1&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Sound Recording Collection and Sound Recovery Project|url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/early-sound-recording-collection-and-sound-recovery-project|work=Smithsonian|publisher=Smithsonian|accessdate=April 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{fv|reason=Does not support 1889 or credit Berliner as first|date=July 2018}} Discs were easier to manufacture, transport and store, and they had the additional benefit of being louder (marginally) than cylinders, which by necessity, were single-sided. Sales of the [[gramophone record]] overtook the cylinder ca. 1910, and by the end of World War I the disc had become the dominant commercial recording format. Edison, who was the main producer of cylinders, created the [[Edison Disc Record]] in an attempt to regain his market. In various permutations, the audio disc format became the primary medium for consumer sound recordings until the end of the 20th century, and the double-sided 78 rpm shellac disc was the standard consumer music format from the early 1910s to the late 1950s.

Although there was no universally accepted speed, and various companies offered discs that played at several different speeds, the major recording companies eventually settled on a ''de facto'' industry standard of nominally 78 revolutions per minute, though the actual speed differed between America and the rest of the world. The specified speed was 78.26 rpm in America and 77.92 rpm throughout the rest of the world. The difference in speeds was due to the difference in the cycle frequencies of the AC electricity that powered the [[stroboscope]]s used to calibrate recording lathes and turntables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Copeland|first1=Peter|title=Manual of Analogue Audio Restoration Techniques|date=2008|publisher=The British Library|location=London|pages=89–90|url=http://www.bl.uk/britishlibrary/~/media/subjects%20images/sound/analoguesoundrestoration.pdf|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nominal speed of the disc format gave rise to its common nickname, the "seventy-eight" (though not until other speeds had become available). Discs were made of shellac or similar brittle plastic-like materials, played with needles made from a variety of materials including mild steel, thorn, and even sapphire. Discs had a distinctly limited playing life that varied depending on how they were produced.

Earlier, purely acoustic methods of recording had limited sensitivity and frequency range.  Mid-frequency range notes could be recorded, but very low and very high frequencies could not. Instruments such as the violin were difficult to transfer to disc. One technique to deal with this involved using a Stroh violin to which was fitted a conical horn connected to a diaphragm that vibrated due to the violin bridge. &lt;!-- I have seen several photographs of performers with their violins at recording sessions, and none show a Stroh violin, which has a distinctive exponential horn.  There was an example, of a modified violin in the musical instruments gallery of the Deutshe Museum, Munich several years ago. --&gt; The horn was no longer needed once electrical recording was developed.

The long-playing 33{{frac|1|3}} rpm microgroove [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] record, or "[[LP record|LP]]", was developed at Columbia Records and introduced in 1948. The short-playing but convenient 7-inch 45 rpm microgroove vinyl [[Single (music)|single]] was introduced by [[RCA Victor]] in 1949. In the US and most developed countries, the two new vinyl formats completely replaced 78 rpm shellac discs by the end of the 1950s, but in some corners of the world, the "78" lingered on far into the 1960s. Vinyl was much more expensive than shellac, one of the several factors that made its use for 78 rpm records very unusual, but with a long-playing disc the added cost was acceptable and the compact "45" format required very little material. Vinyl offered improved performance, both in stamping and in playback. If played with a good diamond stylus mounted in a lightweight pickup on a well-adjusted tonearm, it was long-lasting. If protected from dust, scuffs and scratches there was very little noise. Vinyl records were, over-optimistically, advertised as "unbreakable". They were not, but they were much less fragile than shellac, which had itself once been touted as "unbreakable" compared to wax cylinders.

==Electrical recording==
[[File:Rca44.png|thumb|RCA-44, a classic [[ribbon microphone]] introduced in 1932. Similar units were widely used for recording and broadcasting in the 1940s and are occasionally still used today.]]

Between the invention of the phonograph in 1877 and the first commercial [[digital recording]]s in the early 1970s, arguably the most important milestone in the history of sound recording was the introduction of what was then called ''electrical recording'', in which a [[microphone]] was used to convert the sound into an electrical signal that was amplified and used to actuate the recording stylus. This innovation eliminated the "horn sound" resonances characteristic of the acoustical process, produced clearer and more full-bodied recordings by greatly extending the useful range of audio frequencies, and allowed previously unrecordable distant and feeble sounds to be captured.

Sound recording began as a purely mechanical process. Except for a few crude telephone-based recording devices with no means of amplification, such as the [[Telegraphone]],&lt;ref&gt;The earliest known surviving electrical recording was made on a [[Telegraphone]] magnetic recorder at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. It includes brief comments by Emperor Franz Joseph and the audio quality, ignoring dropouts and some noise of later origin, is comparable to that of a contemporary telephone.&lt;/ref&gt; it remained so until the 1920s when several radio-related developments in [[electronics]] converged to revolutionize the recording process. These included improved microphones and auxiliary devices such as electronic filters, all dependent on electronic [[Amplifier|amplification]] to be of practical use in recording. In 1906, [[Lee De Forest]] invented the [[Audion]] [[triode]] vacuum tube, an electronic valve that could amplify weak electrical signals. By 1915, it was in use in long-distance telephone circuits that made conversations between New York and San Francisco practical. Refined versions of this tube were the basis of all electronic sound systems until the commercial introduction of the first [[transistor]]-based audio devices in the mid-1950s.

During World War I, engineers in the United States and Great Britain worked on ways to record and reproduce, among other things, the sound of a [[German U-boat]] for training purposes. Acoustical recording methods of the time could not reproduce the sounds accurately. The earliest results were not promising.

The first electrical recording issued to the public, with little fanfare, was of November 11, 1920 funeral services for [[The Unknown Warrior]] in [[Westminster Abbey]], London. The recording engineers used microphones of the type used in contemporary telephones. Four were discreetly set up in the abbey and wired to recording equipment in a vehicle outside. Although electronic amplification was used, the audio was weak and unclear. The procedure did, however, produce a recording that would otherwise not have been possible in those circumstances. For several years, this little-noted disc remained the only issued electrical recording.

Several record companies and independent inventors, notably [[Orlando R. Marsh|Orlando Marsh]], experimented with equipment and techniques for electrical recording in the early 1920s. Marsh's electrically recorded [[Autograph Records]] were already being sold to the public in 1924, a year before the first such offerings from the major record companies, but their overall sound quality was too low to demonstrate any obvious advantage over traditional acoustical methods. Marsh's microphone technique was idiosyncratic and his work had little if any impact on the systems being developed by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.mainspringpress.com/marsh_electric.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230521/http://www.mainspringpress.com/marsh_electric.html |archive-date=2016-03-03 |title=When Did Marsh Laboratories Begin to Make Electrical Recordings? |author=Allan Sutton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telephone industry giant [[Western Electric]] had research laboratories (merged with the [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph|AT&amp;T]] engineering department in 1925 to form [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]]) with material and human resources that no record company or independent inventor could match. They had the best microphone, a condenser type developed there in 1916 and greatly improved in 1922,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.coutant.org/ecwente.html |title=A brief summary of E. C. Wente's development of the condenser microphone and of the Western Electric sound recording project as a whole|journal=IEEE Transactions on Education|volume=35, No. 4|date=November 1992|accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the best amplifiers and test equipment. They had already patented an electromechanical recorder in 1918, and in the early 1920s, they decided to intensively apply their hardware and expertise to developing two state-of-the-art systems for electronically recording and reproducing sound: one that employed conventional discs and another that recorded optically on motion picture film. Their engineers pioneered the use of mechanical analogs of electrical circuits and developed a superior "rubber line" recorder for cutting the groove into the wax master in the disc recording system.&lt;ref&gt;Maxfield, J. P. and H. C. Harrison. Methods of high-quality recording and reproduction of speech based on telephone research. ''Bell System Technical Journal,'' July 1926, 493&amp;ndash;523.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1924, such dramatic progress had been made that Western Electric arranged a demonstration for the two leading record companies, the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] and the [[Columbia Records|Columbia Phonograph Company]]. Both soon licensed the system and both made their earliest published electrical recordings in February 1925, but neither actually released them until several months later. To avoid making their existing catalogs instantly obsolete, the two long-time archrivals agreed privately not to publicize the new process until November 1925, by which time enough electrically recorded repertory would be available to meet the anticipated demand. During the next few years, the lesser record companies licensed or developed other electrical recording systems. By 1929 only the budget label [[Harmony Records|Harmony]] was still issuing new recordings made by the old acoustical process.

Comparison of some surviving Western Electric test recordings with early commercial releases indicates that the record companies "dumbed down" the frequency range of the system so the recordings would not overwhelm non-electronic playback equipment, which reproduced very low frequencies as an unpleasant rattle and rapidly wore out discs with strongly recorded high frequencies.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Other recording formats==
In the 1920s, [[Phonofilm]] and other early motion picture sound systems employed [[sound-on-film|optical recording]] technology, in which the audio signal was graphically recorded on photographic film. The amplitude variations comprising the signal were used to modulate a light source which was imaged onto the moving film through a narrow slit, allowing the signal to be photographed as variations in the density or width of a "sound track". The [[movie projector|projector]] used a steady light and a [[photodetector|photoelectric cell]] to convert these variations back into an electrical signal, which was amplified and sent to [[loudspeaker]]s behind the screen. Ironically, the introduction of "[[sound film|talkies]]" was spearheaded by ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927), which used the [[Vitaphone]] [[sound-on-disc]] system rather than an optical soundtrack. Optical sound became the standard motion picture audio system throughout the world and remains so for theatrical release prints despite attempts in the 1950s to substitute magnetic soundtracks. Currently, all release prints on [[35 mm]] film include an analog optical soundtrack, usually stereo with [[Dolby SR]] noise reduction. In addition, an optically recorded digital soundtrack in Dolby Digital and/or Sony SDDS form is likely to be present. An optically recorded timecode is also commonly included to synchronise CDROMs that contain a DTS soundtrack.

This period also saw several other historic developments including the introduction of the first practical magnetic sound recording system, the [[Wire recorder|magnetic wire recorder]], which was based on the work of Danish inventor [[Valdemar Poulsen]]. Magnetic wire recorders were effective, but the sound quality was poor, so between the wars, they were primarily used for voice recording and marketed as business dictating machines. In 1924, a German engineer, Dr. Kurt Stille, developed the Poulsen wire recorder as a dictating machine. The following year, [[Ludwig Blattner]] began work that eventually produced the Blattnerphone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orbem.co.uk/tapes/blattner.htm |title=The Blattnerphone |website=Orbem.co.uk |date=2010-01-10 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; enhancing it to use steel tape instead of wire. The [[BBC]] started using Blattnerphones in 1930 to record radio programmes. In 1933, radio pioneer [[Guglielmo Marconi]]'s company purchased the rights to the Blattnerphone, and newly developed Marconi-Stille recorders were installed in the BBC's [[Maida Vale Studios]] in March 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orbem.co.uk/tapes/ms.htm |title=The Marconi-Stille Recorder - Page 1 |website=Orbem.co.uk |date=2008-02-20 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tape used in Blattnerphones and Marconi-Stille recorders was the same material used to make razor blades, and not surprisingly the fearsome Marconi-Stille recorders were considered so dangerous that technicians had to operate them from another room for safety. Because of the high recording speeds required, they used enormous reels about one metre in diameter, and the thin tape frequently broke, sending jagged lengths of razor steel flying around the studio. The K1 [[Magnetophon]] was the first practical tape recorder, developed by AEG in Germany in 1935.

==Magnetic tape==
{{Main article|Tape recorder}}

[[File:Magnetic-tape-acetate-vs-polyester-backing.jpg|thumb|Magnetic audio tapes: acetate base (left) and polyester base (right)]]

An important field of invention during this period was the [[tape recorder]]. [[Magnetic tape]] recording uses an amplified electrical audio signal to generate analogous variations of the magnetic field produced by a [[tape head]], which impresses corresponding variations of magnetization on the moving tape. In playback mode, the signal path is reversed, the tape head acting as a miniature [[electric generator]] as the varyingly magnetized tape passes over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Mumma|title=Recording|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu/subscriber/article/grove/music/J371600?q=acetate+tape+recording&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=4&amp;_start=1#firsthit|website=Oxford Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original solid steel ribbon was replaced by a much more practical coated paper tape, but acetate soon replaced paper as the standard tape base. Acetate has fairly low tensile strength and if very thin it will snap easily, so it was in turn eventually superseded by polyester. This technology, the basis for almost all commercial recording from the 1950s to the 1980s, was developed in the 1930s by German audio engineers who also rediscovered the principle of [[AC Bias|AC biasing]] (first used in the 1920s for [[wire recorder]]s), which dramatically improved the frequency response of tape recordings. The technology was further improved just after World War II by American audio engineer [[John T. Mullin]] with backing from [[Bing Crosby]] Enterprises. Mullin's pioneering recorders were modifications of captured German recorders. In the late 1940s, the [[Ampex]] company produced the first tape recorders commercially available in the US.

Magnetic tape brought about sweeping changes in both radio and the recording industry. Sound could be recorded, erased and re-recorded on the same tape many times, sounds could be duplicated from tape to tape with only minor loss of quality, and recordings could now be very precisely edited by physically cutting the tape and rejoining it.
Within a few years of the introduction of the first commercial tape recorder—the [[Ampex 200]] model, launched in 1948—American musician-inventor [[Les Paul]] had invented the first [[multitrack tape recorder]], ushering in another technical revolution in the recording industry. Tape made possible the first sound recordings totally created by electronic means, opening the way for the bold sonic experiments of the [[Musique Concrète]] school and avant garde composers like [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], which in turn led to the innovative pop music recordings of artists such as [[Frank Zappa]], [[The Beatles]], and [[The Beach Boys]].

The ease and accuracy of tape editing, as compared to the cumbersome disc-to-disc editing procedures previously in some limited use, together with tape's consistently high audio quality finally convinced radio networks to routinely prerecord their entertainment programming, most of which had formerly been broadcast live. Also, for the first time, broadcasters, regulators and other interested parties were able to undertake comprehensive audio logging of each day's radio broadcasts. Innovations like multitracking and [[Delay (audio effect)|tape echo]] allowed radio programs and advertisements to be produced to a high level of complexity and sophistication. The combined impact with innovations such as the endless loop [[broadcast cartridge]] led to significant changes in the pacing and production style of radio program content and advertising.

==Stereo and hi-fi==
{{See also|Stereophonic sound|High fidelity}}

In 1881, it was noted during experiments in transmitting sound from the Paris Opera that it was possible to follow the movement of singers on the stage if earpieces connected to different microphones were held to the two ears.  This discovery was commercialized in 1890 with the [[Théâtrophone]] system, which operated for over forty years until 1932. In 1931, [[Alan Blumlein]], a British electronics engineer working for [[EMI]], designed a way to make the sound of an actor in a film follow his movement across the screen. In December 1931, he submitted a patent including the idea, and in 1933 this became UK patent number 394,325.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next two years, Blumlein developed stereo microphones and a stereo disc-cutting head, and recorded a number of short films with stereo soundtracks.

In the 1930s, experiments with magnetic tape enabled the development of the first practical commercial sound systems that could record and reproduce high-fidelity [[stereophonic sound]]. The experiments with stereo during the 1930s and 1940s were hampered by problems with synchronization. A major breakthrough in practical stereo sound was made by [[Bell Laboratories]], who in 1937 demonstrated a practical system of two-channel stereo, using dual optical sound tracks on film. Major movie studios quickly developed three-track and four-track sound systems, and the first stereo sound recording for a commercial film was made by [[Judy Garland]] for the [[MGM]] movie ''[[Listen, Darling]]'' in 1938. The first commercially released movie with a stereo soundtrack was Walt Disney's ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', released in 1940.  The 1941 release of Fantasia used the "[[Fantasound]]" sound system. This system used a separate film for the sound, synchronized with the film carrying the picture. The sound film had four double-width optical soundtracks, three for left, center, and right audio—and a fourth as a "control" track with three recorded tones that controlled the playback volume of the three audio channels. Because of the complex equipment this system required, Disney exhibited the movie as a roadshow, and only in the United States.  Regular releases of the movie used standard mono optical 35&amp;nbsp;mm stock until 1956, when Disney released the film with a stereo soundtrack that used the "[[Cinemascope]]" four-track magnetic sound system.

German audio engineers working on magnetic tape developed stereo recording by 1941, even though a 2-track push-pull monaural technique existed in 1939. Of 250 stereophonic recordings made during WW2, only three survive: Beethoven's 5th Piano Concerto with Walter Gieseking and Arthur Rother, a Brahms Serenade, and the last movement of Bruckner's 8th Symphony with Von Karajan. The [[Audio Engineering Society]] has issued all these recordings on [[compact disk|CD]]. ([[Varèse Sarabande]] had released the Beethoven Concerto on LP, and it has been reissued on CD several times since).  Other early German stereophonic tapes are believed to have been destroyed in bombings. Not until [[Ampex]] introduced the first commercial two-track tape recorders in the late 1940s did stereo tape recording become commercially feasible. However, despite the availability of multitrack tape, stereo did not become the standard system for commercial music recording for some years, and remained a specialist market during the 1950s. EMI (UK) was the first company to release commercial stereophonic tapes. They issued their first ''Stereosonic'' tape in 1954. Others quickly followed, under the His Master's Voice and Columbia labels.  161 Stereosonic tapes were released, mostly classical music or lyric recordings. RCA imported these tapes into the USA.

Two-track stereophonic tapes were more successful in America during the second half of the 1950s.  They were duplicated at real time (1:1) or at twice the normal speed (2:1) when later 4-track tapes were often duplicated at up to 16 times the normal speed, providing a lower sound quality in many cases.  Early American 2-track stereophonic tapes were very expensive.  A typical example is the price list of the Sonotape/Westminster reels:  $6.95, $11.95 and $17.95 for the 7000, 9000 and 8000 series respectively.  Some HMV tapes released in the USA also cost up to $15. The history of stereo recording changed after the late 1957 introduction of the ''Westrex stereo phonograph disc'', which used the groove format developed earlier by Blumlein. [[Decca Records]] in England came out with [[FFRR technique|FFRR]] (Full Frequency Range Recording) in the 1940s, which became internationally accepted as a worldwide standard for higher quality recording on vinyl records. The [[Ernest Ansermet]] recording of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s [[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]] was key in the development of full frequency range records and alerting the listening public to high fidelity in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vinylrecordscollector.co.uk/text/vinylhist14a.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020621034232/http://www.vinylrecordscollector.co.uk/text/vinylhist14a.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-06-21 |title=Decca's (ffrr) Frequency Series - History Of Vinyl 1 |website=Vinylrecordscollector.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Record companies mixed most popular music singles into monophonic sound until the mid-1960s—then commonly released major recordings in both mono and stereo until the early 1970s. Many 1960s pop albums available only in stereo in the 2000s were originally released only in mono, and record companies produced the "stereo" versions of these albums by simply separating the two tracks of the master tape, creating "pseudo stereo". In the mid Sixties, as stereo became more popular, many mono recordings (such as The Beach Boys' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'') were remastered using the so-called "[[Stereophonic sound#Pseudo-stereo|fake stereo]]" method, which spread the sound across the stereo field by directing higher-frequency sound into one channel and lower-frequency sounds into the other.

==1950s to 1980s==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}

Magnetic tape transformed the recording industry. By the early 1950s, most commercial recordings were mastered on tape instead of recorded directly to disc. Tape facilitated a degree of manipulation in the recording process that was impractical with mixes and multiple generations of directly recorded discs. An early example is [[Les Paul]]'s 1951 recording of ''[[How High the Moon]]'', on which Paul played eight overdubbed guitar tracks. In the 1960s [[Brian Wilson]] of [[The Beach Boys]], [[Frank Zappa]], and [[The Beatles]] (with producer [[George Martin]]) were among the first popular artists to explore the possibilities of [[multitrack recording]] techniques and effects on their landmark albums ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', ''[[Freak Out!]]'', and ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.

The next important innovation was small cartridge-based tape systems, of which the [[compact cassette]], commercialized by the [[Philips]] electronics company in 1964, is the best known. Initially a low-fidelity format for spoken-word voice recording and inadequate for music reproduction, after a series of improvements it entirely replaced the competing formats: the larger [[8-track tape]] (used primarily in cars) and the fairly similar "Deutsche Cassette" developed by the German company Grundig. This latter system was not particularly common in Europe and practically unheard-of in America. The compact cassette became a major consumer audio format and advances in electronic and mechanical miniaturization led to the development of the [[Sony]] [[Walkman]], a pocket-sized cassette player introduced in 1979. The Walkman was the first personal music player and it gave a major boost to sales of prerecorded cassettes, which became the first widely successful release format that used a re-recordable medium: the vinyl&lt;!-- avoids BE/AE differences --&gt; record was a playback-only medium and commercially prerecorded tapes for [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape decks]], which many consumers found difficult to operate, were never more than an uncommon niche market item.

A key advance in audio fidelity came with the [[Dolby A]] noise reduction system, invented by [[Ray Dolby]] and introduced into professional recording studios in 1966. It suppressed the light but sometimes quite noticeable steady background of hiss, which was the only easily audible downside of mastering on tape instead of recording directly to disc. A competing system, [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx]], invented by David Blackmer, also found success in professional audio. A simpler variant of Dolby's noise reduction system, known as Dolby B, greatly improved the sound of cassette tape recordings by reducing the especially high level of hiss that resulted from the cassette's miniaturized tape format. It, and variants, also eventually found wide application in the recording and film industries. Dolby B was crucial to the popularization&lt;!-- AE appears to be the established variant in this article --&gt; and commercial success of the cassette as a domestic recording and playback medium, and it became a standard feature in the booming home and car stereo market of the 1970s and beyond. The compact cassette format also benefited enormously from improvements to the tape itself as coatings with wider frequency responses and lower inherent noise were developed, often based on cobalt and chrome oxides as the magnetic material instead of the more usual iron oxide.

The multitrack audio cartridge had been in wide use in the radio industry, from the late 1950s to the 1980s, but in the 1960s the pre-recorded [[8-track cartridge]] was launched as a consumer audio format by [[Bill Lear]] of the Lear Jet aircraft company (and although its correct name was the 'Lear Jet Cartridge', it was seldom referred to as such). Aimed particularly at the automotive market, they were the first practical, affordable car hi-fi systems, and could produce sound quality superior to that of the compact cassette. However the smaller size and greater durability &amp;mdash; augmented by the ability to create home-recorded music "compilations" since 8-track recorders were rare &amp;mdash; saw the cassette become the dominant consumer format for portable audio devices in the 1970s and 1980s.

There had been experiments with multi-channel sound for many years &amp;mdash; usually for special musical or cultural events &amp;mdash; but the first commercial application of the concept came in the early 1970s with the introduction of [[Quadraphonic]] sound. This spin-off development from multitrack recording used four tracks (instead of the two used in stereo) and four speakers to create a 360-degree audio field around the listener. Following the release of the first consumer 4-channel [[hi-fi]] systems, a number of popular albums were released in one of the competing four-channel formats; among the best known are [[Mike Oldfield]]'s ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' and [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''. Quadraphonic sound was not a commercial success, partly because of competing and somewhat incompatible four-channel sound systems (e.g., [[CBS]], [[JVC]], [[Dynaco]] and others all had systems) and generally poor quality, even when played as intended on the correct equipment, of the released music. It eventually faded out in the late 1970s, although this early venture paved the way for the eventual introduction of domestic [[Surround Sound]] systems in home theatre use, which have gained enormous popularity since the introduction of the DVD. This widespread adoption has occurred despite the confusion introduced by the multitude of available surround sound standards.

The replacement of the relatively fragile thermionic valve ([[vacuum tube]]) by the smaller, lighter-weight, cooler-running, less expensive, more robust, and less power-hungry [[transistor]] also accelerated the sale of consumer high-fidelity "[[hi-fi]]" sound systems from the 1960s onward. In the 1950s, most record players were monophonic and had relatively low sound quality. Few consumers could afford high-quality stereophonic sound systems. In the 1960s, American manufacturers introduced a new generation of "modular" hi-fi components &amp;mdash; separate turntables, pre-amplifiers, amplifiers, both combined as integrated amplifiers, tape recorders, and other ancillary equipment like the [[graphic equaliser]], which could be connected together to create a complete home sound system. These developments were rapidly taken up by major Japanese electronics companies, which soon flooded the world market with relatively affordable, high-quality transistorized audio components. By the 1980s, corporations like [[Sony]] had become world leaders in the music recording and playback industry.

The advent of [[digital recording|digital sound recording]] and later the [[compact disc]] (CD) in 1982 brought significant improvements in the durability of consumer recordings. The CD initiated another massive wave of change in the consumer music industry, with [[Gramophone record|vinyl records]] effectively relegated to a small niche market by the mid-1990s. However, the record industry fiercely resisted the introduction of digital systems, fearing wholesale piracy on a medium able to produce perfect copies of original released recordings. However, the industry succumbed to the inevitable, though using various protection system (principally [[Serial Copy Management System]], or SCMS).

The most recent and revolutionary developments have been in digital recording, with the development of various uncompressed and compressed digital [[audio file format]]s, [[Microprocessor|processors]] capable and fast enough to convert the digital data to sound in [[Real-time computing|real time]], and inexpensive [[mass storage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society

. This generated new types of [[portable digital audio player]]s. The [[minidisc]] player, using [[ATRAC]] compression on small, cheap, re-writeable discs was introduced in the 1990s but became obsolescent as solid-state non-volatile [[flash memory]] dropped in price. As technologies that increase the amount of data that can be stored on a single medium, such as [[Super Audio CD]], [[DVD-A]], [[Blu-ray Disc]], and [[HD DVD]] become available, longer programs of higher quality fit onto a single disc. Sound files are readily [[download]]ed from the Internet and other sources, and copied onto computers and digital audio players. Digital audio technology is now used in all areas of audio, from casual use of music files of moderate quality to the most demanding professional applications. New applications such as [[internet radio]] and [[podcasting]] have appeared.

Technological developments in recording, editing, and consuming have transformed the [[record industry|record]], [[film industry|movie]] and [[television]] industries in recent decades. [[audio engineering|Audio editing]] became practicable with the invention of [[magnetic tape recording]], but digital audio and cheap [[mass storage]] allows computers to edit audio files quickly, easily, and cheaply. Today, the process of making a recording is separated into tracking, [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] and [[Audio mastering|mastering]]. [[Multitrack recording]] makes it possible to capture signals from several microphones, or from different [[take]]s to tape, disc or mass storage, with maximized [[headroom (audio signal processing)|headroom]] and quality, allowing previously unavailable flexibility in the mixing and mastering stages.

===Software===
There are many different digital audio recording and processing programs running under several computer [[operating system]]s for all purposes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INSTALLATION|url=http://www.waaudiovisual.com.au/service_details.php?id=12|publisher=Waaudiovisual.com.au|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from casual users (e.g., a [[small business]] person recording her "to-do" list on an inexpensive digital recorder) to serious amateurs (an unsigned "indie" band recording their demo on a laptop) to professional [[sound engineer]]s who are recording albums, film scores and doing sound design for [[video games]]. A comprehensive list of digital recording applications is available at the [[digital audio workstation]] article. [[Digital dictation]] software for recording and transcribing speech has different requirements; intelligibility and flexible playback facilities are priorities, while a wide frequency range and high audio quality are not.

==Cultural effects==

{{Unreferenced|section|date=April 2017}}
The development of analog sound recording in the nineteenth century and its widespread use throughout the twentieth century had a huge impact on the development of music. Before analog sound recording was invented, most music was listened to by hearing a live performance, or by singing or playing a song or piece. Throughout the [[Medieval music|medieval]], [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], [[Baroque music|Baroque]], [[Classical music (period)|Classical]], and through much of the [[Romantic music era]], the main way that songs and instrumental pieces were "recorded" was by notating the piece in [[music notation]]. While music notation indicates the pitches of the melody and their rhythm, the notation is not like a 2010-era sound recording. Indeed, in the Medieval era, [[Gregorian chant]] did not indicate the rhythm of the chant. In the Baroque era, instrumental pieces often lack a tempo indication and usually none of the ornaments were written down. As a result, each performance of a song or piece would be slightly different. 

With the development of analog sound recording, though, a performance could be permanently fixed, in all of its elements: pitch, rhythm, timbre, ornaments and expression. This meant that many more elements of a performance would be captured and disseminated to other listeners. The development of sound recording also enabled a much larger proportion of people to hear famous orchestras, operas, singers and bands, because even if a non-wealthy person could not afford to hear the live concert, she or he might be able to afford to buy the recording. The availability of sound recording thus helped to spread musical styles to new regions, countries and continents. The cultural influence went in a number of directions. Sound recordings enabled Western music lovers to hear actual recordings of Asian, Middle Eastern and African groups and performers, increasing awareness of non-Western musical styles. At the same time, sound recordings enabled non-Western music lovers to hear the most famous North American and European groups and singers.

==Legal status==

In copyright law, a "phonogram" or "sound recording" is a work that results from the fixation of sounds in a medium. The notice of copyright in a phonogram uses the [[sound recording copyright symbol]], which the [[Geneva Phonograms Convention]] defines as ℗ (the letter P in a full circle). This usually accompanies the copyright notice for the underlying musical composition, which uses the ordinary © symbol.

=== US ===

United States copyright law defines "sound recordings" as "works that result from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds" other than an audiovisual work's soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. §101&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the Sound Recording Amendment (SRA),&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 92-140, § 3, 85 Stat. 391, 392 (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; which took effect in 1972, copyright in sound recordings was handled at the level of the several states. Federal copyright law preempts most state copyright laws but allows state copyright in sound recordings to continue for one full copyright term after the SRA's effective date,&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. §301(c)&lt;/ref&gt; which means 2067.

=== UK ===

Since 1934, copyright law in Great Britain has treated sound recordings (or ''phonograms'') differently from [[musical work]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Gramaphone Company v. Stephen Cawardine''&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]'' defines a sound recording as (a) a recording of sounds, from which the sounds may be reproduced, or (b) a recording of the whole or any part of a literary, dramatic or musical work, from which sounds reproducing the work or part may be produced, regardless of the medium on which the recording is made or the method by which the sounds are reproduced or produced. It thus covers vinyl records, tapes, [[compact disc]]s, digital audiotapes, and MP3s that embody recordings.

[[Image:Southern-belle-civil-war.jpg|thumb|Cover illustration of ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', September 7, 1861 showing a stereotypical Southern belle]]
The '''Southern belle''' (derived from the French word ''belle'', 'beautiful') is a [[stock character]] representing a young woman of the American [[Deep South]]'s upper socioeconomic class.

== Origin ==
The image of the Southern belle developed in the South during the [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum era .281783.E2.80.931861.29|antebellum]] era.  It was based on the young, unmarried woman in the plantation-owning upper class of Southern society.&lt;ref name="richmond1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historyengine.richmond.edu/episodes/view/2259 |title=History Engine: Tools for Collaborative Education and Research &amp;#124; Episodes |publisher=Historyengine.richmond.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Portrait of Sallie Ward by George Peter Alexander Healy, 1860.jpg|thumb|right|Sallie Ward, a Southern belle]]

== Characteristics ==
The image of a Southern belle is often characterized by fashion elements such as a [[hoop skirt]], a [[corset]], [[pantalettes]], a wide-brimmed [[straw hat]], and gloves. As signs of tanning were considered working-class and unfashionable during this era, [[parasol]]s and [[Hand fan|fan]]s are also often represented.&lt;ref name="richmond1"/&gt;

Southern belles were expected to marry respectable young men, and become ladies of society dedicated to the family and community.&lt;ref name="richmond1"/&gt; The Southern belle archetype is characterized by [[Southern hospitality]], a cultivation of beauty, and a flirtatious yet chaste demeanor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deepsouthmag.com/2011/06/anatomy-of-a-southern-belle/ |title=Anatomy of a Southern Belle &amp;#124; Deep South Magazine – Southern Food, Travel &amp; Lit |publisher=Deepsouthmag.com |date=June 2, 2011 |accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[Sally Ward Lawrence Hunt Armstrong Downs|Sallie Ward]], who was born into the Southern aristocracy of Kentucky in the Antebellum South, was called a Southern belle.&lt;ref name=thekentucky&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Thomas D.|title=The Kentucky|date=2015|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington, Kentucky|pages=238–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The Southern belle archetype has been criticized as part of an overall [[Idealization and devaluation|idealization]] of the Antebellum era American South in popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gawker.com/the-southern-belle-is-a-racist-fiction-1647358414|title=The 'Southern Belle' is a Racist Fiction|last=Biddle|first=Sam|date=October 17, 2014|website=Gawker|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/removing-the-southern-belle-from-her-inglorious-perch/2015/08/14/ea929b2a-3f96-11e5-9561-4b3dc93e3b9a_story.html|title=Remove the Southern belle from her inglorious perch|last=Boyd|first=Elizabeth|date=August 21, 2015|website=The Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavery]] figured strongly into the &lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Plantations in the American South|region's economy]] during the [[Plantation era#Plantation era social structure|plantation era]].

'''''The Stan-hattan Project''''' was a writing workshop conducted as a joint venture by [[Marvel Comics]] and [[New York University]] (NYU)'s Department of Dramatic Writing between 1995 and 1996, whose aim was to develop new writing talent for the comic book publisher and to provide practical training and professional opportunities for students at the university. The name is a [[portmanteau]] of Marvel Comics editor [[Stan Lee|'''Stan''' Lee]] and the [[Manhattan Project|Man'''hattan''' Project]] (the [[World War II]] program that developed the first [[atomic bomb]]).

Graduates of the program, which was overseen by Marvel editor [[James Felder]], were given access to Marvel Comics staff and the chance to see some of their work published.

'''The Force''' is a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[Energy (esotericism)|ubiquitous power]] in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[fictional universe]]. It is wielded by characters throughout the franchise: heroes like the [[Jedi]] use the "light side" of the Force, while the [[Sith]] and other villains exploit the "dark side". The Force has been compared to aspects of several world religions, and the phrase "'''May the Force be with you'''" has become part of the popular culture [[vernacular]].

== Concept and development ==
[[File:George Lucas cropped 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|[[George Lucas]] created the concept of "the Force" both to advance the plot of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) and to try to awaken a sense of spirituality in young audience members.]]

=== Creation for the original films ===
[[George Lucas]] created the concept of the Force to address character and plot developments in ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977).&lt;ref name="tpmscrapbook"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace Movie Scrapbook|last=Windham|first=Ryder|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=1999|isbn=9780375800085|page=11|author-link=Ryder Windham}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wanted to "awaken a certain kind of spirituality" in young audiences, suggesting a belief in God without endorsing any specific religion.&lt;ref name="mythologyofsw"&gt;''The Mythology of Star Wars'' (2000 documentary)&lt;/ref&gt; He developed the Force as a nondenominational religious concept, "distill[ed from] the essence of all religions", premised on the existence of God and distinct ideas of good and evil.&lt;ref name="tpmscrapbook" /&gt; Lucas said that there is a conscious choice between good and bad, and "the world works better if you're on the good side".&lt;ref name="taylor-58"&gt;[[#taylor|Taylor]], p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970s [[San Francisco]], where Lucas lived when he wrote the drafts that became ''Star Wars'', [[New Age]] ideas that incorporated the concept of ''[[qi]]'' and other notions of a mystical life-force were "in the air" and widely embraced.&lt;ref&gt;[[#kaminski|Kaminski]], pp. 75–77&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucas used the term ''the Force'' to "echo" its use by cinematographer [[Roman Kroitor]] in ''[[21-87]]'' (1963), in which Kroitor says, "Many people feel that in the contemplation of nature and in communication with other living things, they become aware of some kind of force, or something, behind this apparent mask which we see in front of us, and they call it God".&lt;ref name="mythologyofsw" /&gt; Although Lucas had Kroitor's line in mind specifically, Lucas said the underlying sentiment is universal and that "similar phrases have been used extensively by many different people for the last 13,000 years".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2005/05/lucas-2/|title=Life After Darth|last=Silberman|first=Steve|date=May 1, 2005|website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|access-date=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first draft of ''Star Wars'' makes two references to "the Force of Others" and does not explain the concept: King Kayos utters the blessing "May the Force of Others be with you all", and he later says "I feel the Force also".&lt;ref name="taylor-112"&gt;[[#taylor|Taylor]], p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The power of the Force of Others is kept secret by the Jedi Bendu of the Ashla, an "aristocratic cult" in the second draft.&lt;ref name="bouzereau-36"&gt;[[#bouzereau|Bouzereau]], p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taylor-116"&gt;[[#taylor|Taylor]], p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; The second draft offers a lengthy explanation of the Force of Others and introduces its Ashla light side and Bogan dark side.&lt;ref name="taylor-116" /&gt; The Ashla and Bogan are mentioned 10 and 31 times, respectively, and the Force of Others plays a more prominent role in the story.&lt;ref name="taylor-116-117"&gt;[[#taylor|Taylor]], pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt; In this draft, Luke Starkiller's mission is to retrieve the [[Kiber Crystal]], which can intensify either the Ashla or Bogan powers.&lt;ref name="bouzereau-36" /&gt; The film's shorter third draft has no references to the Ashla, but it mentions the Bogan eight times and Luke is still driven to recover the Kiber Crystal.&lt;ref name="taylor-122"&gt;[[#taylor|Taylor]], p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bouzereau-37"&gt;[[#bouzereau|Bouzereau]], p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucas finished the fourth and near-final draft on January 1, 1976.&lt;ref name="taylor-126"&gt;[[#taylor|Taylor]], p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; This version trims "the Force of Others" to "the Force", makes a single reference to the Force's seductive "dark side", distills an explanation of the Force to 28 words, and eliminates the Kiber Crystal.&lt;ref name="taylor-142"&gt;[[#taylor|Taylor]], p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Gary Kurtz]], who studied [[comparative religion]] in college, had long discussions with Lucas about religion and philosophy throughout the writing process.&lt;ref name="taylor-144"&gt;[[#taylor|Taylor]], p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Kurtz told Lucas he was unhappy with drafts in which the Force was connected with the Kiber Crystal, and he was also dissatisfied with the early Ashla and Bogan concepts.&lt;ref name="taylor-144" /&gt;

{{Quote box|width=25%|align=right|quote="The act of living generates a force field, an energy. That energy surrounds us; when we die, that energy joins with all the other energy. There is a giant mass of energy in the universe that has a good side and a bad side. We are part of the Force because we generate the power that makes the Force live. When we die, we become part of that Force, so we never really die; we continue as part of the Force."|source=—[[George Lucas]] describing the Force during an ''[[The Empire Strikes Back|Empire Strikes Back]]'' production meeting&lt;ref name="bouzereau-181"&gt;[[#bouzereau|Bouzereau]], p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;|style=padding:10px; background-color: #EFEFEF;}}
Lucas and screenwriter [[Leigh Brackett]] decided that the Force and the Emperor would be the main concerns in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980).&lt;ref name="bouzereau-173"&gt;[[#bouzereau|Bouzereau]], p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on the Emperor was later shifted to the third film, ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983),&lt;ref name="bouzereau-173" /&gt; and the dark side of the Force was treated as ''The Empire Strikes Back''{{'}}s main villain.&lt;ref name="bouzereau-182"&gt;[[#bouzereau|Bouzereau]], p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prequel films and midi-chlorians===
''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'' (1999) introduces "midi-chlorians", microscopic creatures that connect characters to the Force, although Lucas had conceived the idea as early as August 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/star-wars-prequels-midichlorians-george-lucas-1977/|title=Star Wars: George Lucas Invented Midichlorians In 1977|last=Leadbeater|first=Alex|date=November 17, 2018|website=[[Screen Rant]]|accessdate=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taylor-59"&gt;[[#taylor|Taylor]], p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas based the concept on [[symbiogenesis]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rolling Stone]]'', June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; calling midi-chlorians a "loose depiction" of [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]].&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techland.time.com/2010/08/10/20000-per-cell-why-midi-chlorians-suck/|title=20,000 Per Cell: Why Midi-chlorians Suck|last=Narcisse|first=Evan|date=August 10, 2010|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further said:{{Quote|[Mitochondria] probably had something – which will come out someday – to do with the beginnings of life and how one cell decided to become two cells with a little help from this other little creature who came in, without whom life couldn't exist. And it's really a way of saying we have hundreds of little creatures who live on us, and without them, we all would die. There wouldn't be any life. They are necessary for us; we are necessary for them. Using them in the metaphor, saying society is the same way, says we all must get along with each other.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;}}

=== Sequel films and other productions ===
Lucas' story treatments for a potential sequel trilogy involved "a microbiotic world" and creatures known as the Whills, beings that "control the universe" and "feed off the Force." He elaborated that individuals function as "vehicles for the Whills to travel around in", and that midi-chlorians "communicate with the Whills [who] in a general sense... are the Force.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2018/06/george-lucas-episode-vii-episode-ix-1201974276/|title=‘Star Wars’: George Lucas Would Have Set Third Trilogy in ‘Microbiotic World’ Linked to Midi-Chlorians|last=Marotta|first=Jenna|publisher=IndieWire|date=June 13, 2018|accessdate=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After selling Lucasfilm to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] in 2012, Lucas said his biggest concern about the franchise's future was the Force being "muddled into a bunch of [[Gibberish|gobbledegook]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/19/george-lucas-star-wars-criticism-jj-abrams-disney-jar-jar-binks|title=George Lucas says he would not direct another Star Wars film after criticism|last=Child|first=Ben|date=November 19, 2015|website=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When writing ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'' (2015) with [[Lawrence Kasdan]], [[J. J. Abrams]] respected that Lucas had established midi-chlorians' effect on some characters' ability to use the Force.&lt;ref name="abramsmidis"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/jj-abrams-midi-chlorians/|title=JJ Abrams on Midi-chlorians And The Inclusiveness Of The Force|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|date=December 7, 2015|website=[[/Film]]|access-date=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, though, he interpreted [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]'s explanation of the Force in ''Star Wars'' to mean that any character could use its power, and that the Force was more grounded in spirituality than science.&lt;ref name="abramsmidis" /&gt; Abrams retained the idea of the Force having a light and a dark side, and some characters' seduction by the dark side helps create conflict for the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-jj-abrams-star-wars-empire-d23-20150817-story.html|title=J.J.

''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' producer [[Dave Filoni]] cites several influences on how the Force is used in the show. The character [[Bendu (Star Wars)|Bendu]] — named in homage to the term Lucas originally associated with the Jedi — does not align with the franchise's normal dark-or-light duality, and this role is an extension of Filoni's conversations with Lucas about the nature of the Force.&lt;ref name="birthmoviesdeath"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2016/07/20/in-star-wars-rebels-the-force-isnt-just-for-the-jedi|title=In Star Wars Rebels The Force Isn’t Just For The Jedi|last=Faraci|first=Devin|date=July 20, 2016|website=Birth.Movies.Death.|access-date=September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slashfilmbendu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/dave-filoni-star-wars-rebels-season-3-interview/2/|title=Dave Filoni Star Wars Rebels Season 3 Interview|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|date=September 23, 2016|website=[[/Film]]|access-date=September 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filoni credits the prequel films for better developing the concept of the Force, particularly the idea of a balance between the light and dark sides.&lt;ref name="prequelsmatter"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/starwars/2017/02/17/dave-filoni-explains-why-the-star-wars-prequels-are-so-important/|title=Dave Filoni Explains Why the Star Wars Prequels Are So Important to Today's Stories|last=Siegel|first=Lucas|date=February 17, 2017|website=Comicbook|access-date=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] describes the Force as "an energy field created by all living things" in ''Star Wars''. In ''The Phantom Menace'', [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] says microscopic lifeforms called midi-chlorians, which exist inside all living cells, allow some characters to be Force-sensitive; characters must have a high enough midi-chlorian count to feel and use the Force.&lt;ref name="BrooksEpisodeI"&gt;{{cite book|title=Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace|last=Brooks|first=Terry|date=1999|publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]|location=New York|authorlink=Terry Brooks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Lucas compared using the Force to [[yoga]], saying any character can use its power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/22/star-wars-prequels-return-of-the-jedi_n_3313793.html|title=''Star Wars'' Prequels Were Mapped Out By George Lucas &amp; Lawrence Kasdan In 1981: Exclusive Excerpt From ''The Making Of Star Wars: Return of the Jedi''|last=Ryan|first=Mike|date=May 22, 2013|access-date=May 23, 2016|work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Filoni said in 2015 that all ''Star Wars'' characters are "Force intuitive": some characters, like [[Luke Skywalker]], are aware of their connection to the Force, while characters such as [[Han Solo]] draw upon the Force unconsciously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slwtHYyKMbY&amp;t=10m40s|title=Star Wars Rebels Discussion at FTW Comics: Dave Filoni, Henry Gilroy, and Kilian Plunkett Part 2|date=June 2, 2015|access-date=May 26, 2016|time=10m, 40s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filoni said the most potent Force users are characters with a natural affinity for using the Force, as indicated by their midi-chlorian count, who undertake intense training and discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/starwars/2016/07/19/star-wars-rebels-showrunner-dave-filoni-defends-and-explains-mid/|title=Star Wars Rebels Showrunner Dave Filoni Defends and Explains Midi-chlorians|last=Siegel|first=Lucas|date=July 19, 2016|website=ComicBook.com|access-date=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rogue One]]'' (2016) portrays the Force more as a religion "than simply a way to manipulate objects and people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/starwars/2016/12/18/how-the-force-changed-in-rogue-one-a-star-wars-story/|title=How The Force Changed in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story|last=Siegel|first=Lucas|date=December 18, 2016|accessdate=May 24, 2017|work=comicbook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years following the [[Great Jedi Purge]] depicted in the prequel trilogy, some characters have lost faith in the Force,&lt;ref name="timerogueone" /&gt; and the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] hunts down surviving Jedi and other Force-sensitive characters.

Some Force-sensitive characters can derive special, [[psychic abilities]] from it, such as [[telekinesis]], [[mind control]], and [[extrasensory perception]]. The Force is sometimes referred to in terms of "dark" and "light" sides, with villains like the [[Sith]] drawing on the dark side to act aggressively while the [[Jedi]] use the light side for defense and peace.&lt;ref name="magicofmyth"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=5wROWR2Wbv8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=the+force+light+dark+star+wars&amp;ots=lYbQ_WmkUh&amp;sig=RTB394vQIHOFMHBM0AOB7IqXGJ4#v=onepage&amp;q=light%20side&amp;f=false|title=Star Wars: The Magic of Myth|last=Henderson|first=Mary|publisher=[[Bantam Books]]|year=1997|isbn=9780553378108|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Filoni, Lucas believed a character's intentions when using the Force — their "willingness or will to be selfless or selfish" — is what distinguishes light and dark sides.&lt;ref name="prequelsmatter" /&gt; The Force is also used by characters who are neither Jedi nor Sith, such as [[Princess Leia|Leia Organa]] and [[Kylo Ren]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-jj-abrams-explains-847013|title='Star Wars': J.J.

===Religion and spirituality===
In his 1977 review of ''Star Wars'', [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the Force "a mixture of what appears to be ESP and early Christian faith".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/052677wars.html|title=''Star Wars''—A Trip to a Far Galaxy That's Fun and Funny...|last=Canby|first=Vincent|date=May 26, 1977|work=[[The New York Times]]|authorlink=Vincent Canby|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Magic of Myth'' compares the sharp distinction between the good "light side" and evil "dark side" of the Force to [[Zoroastrianism]], which posits that "good and evil, like light and darkness, are contrary realities".&lt;ref name="magicofmyth" /&gt; The connectedness between the light and dark sides has been compared to the relationship between [[yin and yang]] in [[Taoism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FfBJSfmRhm0C&amp;pg=PT53|title=Religions Of Star Trek|last2=Cassidy|first2=William|last3=Schwartz|first3=Susan L.|date=2009|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0786750227|last1=Kraemer|first1=Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the balance between yin and yang lacks the element of evil associated with the dark side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHgKDWAZ0SIC&amp;pg=PA156|title=Sex, Politics, and Religion in Star Wars: An Anthology|last=Jamilla|first=Nick|date=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=081088514X|pages=156–157|chapter=Chapter 12: Defining the Jedi Order|editor1-last=Brode|editor1-first=Douglas|editor2-last=Deyneka|editor2-first=Leah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor identifies other similarities between the Force and a [[Navajo]] prayer, [[prana]], and [[qi]].&lt;ref name="taylor-59" /&gt; It is a common plot device in ''[[jidaigeki]]'' films like ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'' (1958), which inspired ''Star Wars'', for [[samurai]] who master qi to achieve astonishing feats of swordsmanship.&lt;ref&gt;[[#kaminski|Kaminski]], p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor added that the lack of detail about the Force makes it "a religion for the secular age".&lt;ref name="taylor-58" /&gt; According to Jennifer Porter, professor of religious studies at the [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]], "the Force is a metaphor for godhood that resonates and inspires within [people] a deeper commitment to the godhood identified within their traditional faith".&lt;ref name="taylor-59-60"&gt;[[#taylor|Taylor]], pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific and parascientific perspectives===
Astrophysicist [[Jeanne Cavelos]] says in ''[[The Science of Star Wars (book)|The Science of Star Wars]]'' that the Force raises questions that scientists have long asked.&lt;ref name="cavelos-177"&gt;[[#sosw|Cavelos]], p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; She points out that the ancient Greeks explored the idea of a "[[Aether (classical element)|fifth element]]" that permeated and connected everything in the universe, and that [[Isaac Newton]] proposed that the human brain might be able to trigger waves in the [[Aether theories|ether]], giving humans psychic powers.&lt;ref name="cavelos-179-180"&gt;[[#sosw|Cavelos]], pp. 179–180&lt;/ref&gt; Cavelos's sources are mostly skeptical about a "real world" explanation for the Force, but they explore ideas in areas such as [[quantum physics]], [[parapsychology]], and the notion of science so advanced that it appears magical.&lt;ref name="cavelos-178-179"&gt;[[#sosw|Cavelos]], pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining the Force is particularly difficult, Cavelos says, because "it does so many different things".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/science-of-star-wars-clone-wars/|title=The Science of Star Wars: The Clone Wars -- Q&amp;A with Author Jeanne Cavelos|last=Hadhazy|first=Adam|date=August 11, 2008|website=[[Scientific American]]|publisher=[[Springer Nature]]|access-date=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several scientists have said it is best not to try to explain how the Force works.&lt;ref name="cavelos-179"&gt;[[#sosw|Cavelos]], p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/discussion/how-real-is-the-science-in-star-wars|title=How real is the science in Star Wars?|last=Yu|first=Karen|date=December 18, 2015|website=[[University of Cambridge]]|access-date=May 25, 2016|quote=...perhaps there are some wonders in Star Wars that we don’t need to explain.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavelos says the Force "suggests a universe quite different than the one we think we're living in", and that some unknown fields or particles might explain the Force.&lt;ref name="cavelos-191-192"&gt;[[#sosw|Cavelos]], pp. 191–192&lt;/ref&gt; Cavelos believes [[vacuum energy]] is one option to power physical Force feats,&lt;ref name="cavelos-180"&gt;[[#sosw|Cavelos]], p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; and she says a [[fifth force]] beyond the [[Fundamental interaction|four fundamental interactions]] might account for the Force.&lt;ref name="cavelos-191"&gt;[[#sosw|Cavelos]], p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Flavio Fenton of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] School of Physics suggests a fifth force would carry two types of charge — one for the light side and one for the dark — and that each would be carried by its own particle.&lt;ref name="gatech"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.gatech.edu/features/science-star-wars|title=The Science of Star Wars|last=Maderer|first=Jason|publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology]]|access-date=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepomuk Otte, also from Georgia Tech, cautions that [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law of motion]] says telekinesis would apply a force back on the Force-wielding character.&lt;ref name="gatech" /&gt; Force powers like [[precognition]] are challenging to explain because of the implied time travel of information, but Cavelos suggests [[tachyon]]s traveling [[Faster-than-light|faster than light]] might carry such information.&lt;ref name="cavelos-188-189"&gt;[[#sosw|Cavelos]], pp. 188–189&lt;/ref&gt; Cavelos explores the possibility of brain implants or sensors being used to detect users' intent and manipulate energy fields to control the Force.&lt;ref name="cavelos-183-184"&gt;[[#sosw|Cavelos]], pp. 183–184&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michio Kaku]] says Luke Skywalker's Jedi training on [[Dagobah]] might involve learning to control [[Electroencephalography|brain waves]], and Cavelos compares such discipline to contemporary patients learning to control [[Prosthesis|prosthetics]].&lt;ref name="cavelos-183-184" /&gt;

Critic Tim Robley compared the Force to the [[ruby slippers]] from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939), with both being entities that send the protagonist on a quest.&lt;ref name="Robley"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/star-wars--a-new-hope/movies-influences-george-lucas/|title=10 films that influenced ''Star Wars''|last=Robey|first=Tim|date=November 24, 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1980 ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' review of ''The Empire Strikes Back'', [[Judith Martin]] described the Force as "a mishmash of current cultic fashions without any base in ideas.

The introduction of midi-chlorians in ''The Phantom Menace'' was controversial, with Evan Narcisse of ''Time'' writing that the concept ruined ''Star Wars'' for him and a generation of fans because "the mechanisms of the Force became less spiritual and more scientific".&lt;ref name="time" /&gt; Film historian Daniel Dinello argued, "Anathema to ''Star Wars'' fanatics who thought they reduced the Force to a kind of viral infection, midi-chlorians provide a biological interface, the link between physical bodies and spiritual energy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Daniel|last=Dinello|title=Technophobia!: Science Fiction Visions of Posthuman Technology|year=2005|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|page=211|isbn=0-292-70986-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to "midi-chlorians" became a screenwriting shorthand for over-explaining a concept.&lt;ref name="forgivegl"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/star-wars-the-force-awakens/george-lucas-movies-hate-defence/|title=Why it's time to stop hating George Lucas|last=Bell|first=Chris|date=December 16, 2015|website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|access-date=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Chris Taylor suggested fans want less detail, not more, in explaining the Force,&lt;ref name="taylor-58" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/review-how-star-wars-conquered-the-universe-by-chris-taylor/2014/10/09/6cd5afa2-32bc-11e4-8f02-03c644b2d7d0_story.html|title=Review: ''How Star Wars Conquered the Universe'' by Chris Taylor|last=Musgrove|first=Mike|date=October 10, 2014|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the introduction of midi-chlorians provided depth to the franchise and fomented engagement among fans and franchise writers.&lt;ref name="forgivegl" /&gt; Religion expert [[John D.

=== "May the Force be with you" ===

Several ''Star Wars'' characters say "May the Force be with you" (or derivatives of it) and the expression has become a popular [[catchphrase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gomez|first1=Rolando|title=Socially Smart: Twitter Plus Facebook, Marketing Multipliers And Brand Boosters|publisher=BookBaby|isbn=9781626754751|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wJddDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, "May the Force be with you" was chosen as number 8 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes|100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes]] list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/100years/quotes.aspx|title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|author=[[American Film Institute]]|accessdate=May 25, 2016|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; May 4 is [[Star Wars Day]], taken from the [[pun]] "May the Fourth be with you".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title='Star Wars' Day: May The 4th Be With You|date=May 4, 2010|url=http://www.myfoxchattanooga.com/dpps/entertainment/star-wars-day-may-the-4th-be-with-you-dpgoha-20100504-fc_7371587|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100508193201/http://www.myfoxchattanooga.com/dpps/entertainment/star-wars-day-may-the-4th-be-with-you-dpgoha-20100504-fc_7371587|deadurl=yes|publisher=My Fox Chattanooga|archivedate=May 8, 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The expression was intentionally similar to the Christian ''[[dominus vobiscum]]'', "the Lord be with you".&lt;ref name="taylor-60"&gt;[[#taylor|Taylor]], p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1985 said "the Force is with us", referring to the [[United States]], to create the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] to protect against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ballistic missiles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-03-30/news/8501170975_1_aggressive-civilian-space-agenda-star-wars-national-space-club|title='The Force Is With Us,' Reagan Says|last=de Lama|first=George|date=March 30, 1985|website=[[The Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some weeks earlier, Reagan had compared the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] to the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/04/politics/flashback-friday-reagan-star-wars-speech/index.html|title=#FBF: Ronald Reagan and Star Wars|last=Williams|first=Brenna|date=May 4, 2018|work=[[CNN]]|access-date=May 4, 2018|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Gospel According to Star Wars'' asserts that Reagan's invocation of the Force

Moreover, the [''Star Wars'']&lt;!--originally "SW"--&gt; blessing is precisely a request for ''hope'' for others ("''May'' the Force be with you"), whereas Reagan's claim sounds like a ''possessive'' assertion ("The Force ''is'' with us").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Gospel According to Star Wars: Faith, Hope, and the Force|first=John C.|last=McDowell|publisher=[[Westminster John Knox]]|year=2007|page=26|isbn=9781611644258}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--FYI, emphasis/italics are from the original source--&gt;}}

'''''The Kingdom of the Wicked''''' is a 1985 [[historical novel]] by [[Anthony Burgess]].

Like two of his earlier works, the long narrative poem ''[[Moses: A Narrative|Moses]]'' and the novel ''[[Man of Nazareth]]'' (together these books make up what has been referred to as his biblical or religious trilogy), Burgess wrote ''The Kingdom of the Wicked'' in part as preparation for a screenplay; in this case for the
television series ''[[A.D. (miniseries)|A.D.]]''

==Plot summary==
The story of the birth of [[Christianity]] and its interaction with the [[Roman Empire]] is told largely chronologically by a narrator slowly succumbing to disease during the reign of [[Domitian]].

The story starts where ''Man of Nazareth'' ended, immediately after the [[crucifixion]] of [[Jesus]], and covers the work of the [[Twelve apostles|apostles]], in particular [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] (who himself was not one of the original twelve apostles), the development of Christianity as an [[Abrahamic religion]] separate from [[Judaism]], the [[Nero#Great Fire of Rome|Great Fire of Rome]], the persecution of Christians, the destruction of the [[Second Temple]], and the destruction of [[Pompeii]].

'''Thingsoft''' ({{lang-ko|띵소프트}}) is an online game development company in South Korea. Its headquarters is in Seoul, South Korea.

==History==
Thingsoft was originally established in 2005 with funding from [[Neowiz]], a large South Korean online game publisher. [[Neowiz]] fully acquired Thingsoft in 2006 following the successful launch of Thingsoft's first commercial product, FIFA Online. The acquisition integrated Thingsoft into the [[Neowiz]] as an internal development studio.  In 2007, [[Neowiz]] split into several smaller companies, and Thingsoft was officially changed to [[Neowiz Games]] Development Studio. Thingsoft was responsible for the development of several online games including FIFA Online, [[FIFA Online 2]], the NBA Street Online series, [[Battlefield Online]], [[Warlord]], Xogu Pigu, Sashinmu, and Perfect KO. [[FIFA Online 2]] proved especially successful in South Korea and garnered over 180,000 [[concurrent user]]s in 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.joins.com/article/article.asp?ctg=12&amp;Total_ID=2478832 Football finals kickoff online for FIFA game]&lt;/ref&gt; and over 220,000 concurrent users in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiamog.com/?p=183 FIFA Online 2 Korea cracks 220K Concurrent Users]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the founders of Thingsoft and core developers from [[FIFA Online 2]] and Project GG left [[Neowiz Games]] to start a new independent online development company.  The new company acquired the rights to the trademark and is once again known as Thingsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{ko icon}} [http://www.thisisgame.com/board/view.php?id=397178&amp;category=103 Interview - Sangwon Chung, CEO of Thingsoft]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions==

===Studio One===
Studio One consists of core members from the [[FIFA Online 2]] development team. Studio One focuses on developing casual online games and is currently developing [[social network game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ko icon}} [http://www.dt.co.kr/contents.html?article_no=2010080602011231749002 Interview - Jae Kim, Head of Studio One, Thingsoft]&lt;/ref&gt;  Studio One has developed its own online game engine capable of supporting both casual [[MMO game]]s and [[social network game]]s.  Studio One's first [[social network game]], "[[Wonder Cruise]]", launched on Facebook in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nexon-docks-ss-wonder-cruise-224900586.html Nexon Docks SS Wonder Cruise on Facebook Today]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Wonder Cruise]] is a cruise simulation game where users are tasked with running their own luxury cruise liner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidesocialgames.com/2011/12/09/nexon-christens-wonder-cruise-on-facebook/ Nexon Christens Wonder Cruise on Facebook]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studio NT===

===Project NT===
Project NT is an [[MMORPG]] that uses cell animation in a Japanese anime style. The game utilizes a self-developed engine that the developers say will allow players to use various [[sandbox game|sandbox]] features such as building a town and play-writing cutscenes.

In the course of the game, the protagonist must "reconsider—and risk wrecking—" his career and relationship.&lt;ref name="avclub" /&gt;

A reviewer for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' described the puzzles as "smart but logical" and "fit[ting] thematically into the story."&lt;ref name="avclub" /&gt; The reviewer also called out the ability to disable "'heteronormativity,' so you can play as Violet’s girlfriend" as something that makes the game "Worth playing for".&lt;ref name="avclub" /&gt; A second review also observes this option, noting that at least one puzzle changes based on the choice.&lt;ref name="jayisgames" /&gt;

A writer for [[Jay Is Games]] called out ''Violet'' for "succeed[ing] in the difficult task of capturing the intricacies of a dynamic relationship."&lt;ref name="jayaward" /&gt; The writer also praised the game for succeeding at engaging the player at "the core emotional level", again noting how difficult this is.&lt;ref name="jayaward" /&gt;  [[Emily Short]], in a review on Jay Is Games, noted the strength of the implementation, pointing to the breadth of "interesting responses even to silly or unexpected actions."&lt;ref name="jayisgames" /&gt; Short felt that the characters were "seemingly-real" and "their problem is plausible and serious."&lt;ref name="jayisgames" /&gt;
