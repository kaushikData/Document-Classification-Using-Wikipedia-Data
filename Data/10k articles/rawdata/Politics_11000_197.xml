{{Political anthropology|expanded=Basic concepts}}

'''Achieved status''' is a concept developed by the anthropologist [[Ralph Linton]] denoting a [[social status|social position]] that a person can acquire on the basis of merit; it is a position that is earned or chosen. It is the opposite of [[ascribed status]]. It reflects personal skills, abilities, and efforts. Examples of achieved status are being an Olympic athlete, being a criminal, or being a college professor.

Status is important sociologically because it comes with a set of rights, obligations, behaviors, and duties that people occupying a certain position are expected or encouraged to perform. These expectations are referred to as [[role]]s. For instance, the role of a "professor" includes teaching students, answering their questions, being impartial, appropriately.

==Achieved status vs. ascribed status==

[[Ascribed status]] is a position assigned to individuals or groups based on traits beyond their control, such as sex, race, or parental social status. This is usually associated with "closed" societies. Achieved status is distinguished from [[ascribed status]] by virtue of being earned.

Many positions are a mixture of achievement and ascription; for instance, a person who has achieved the status of being a physician is more likely to have the ascribed status of being born into a wealthy family. This is usually associated with "open" societies or "social" class societies.

==Social mobility==

[[Social mobility]] refers to one's ability to move their status either up or down within the [[social stratification]] system, as compared with their family’s status in early life.  Some people with achieved status have improved their position within the social system via their own merit and achievements.

Someone may also have achieved status that decreases their position within the social system, such as by becoming a notorious criminal.  In a society that one's position in that society can change due to their actions, either increase or decrease, that society can be referred to as an Open System.  A Closed System society would not allow [[Social mobility]] as easily as an Open System.

==Cultural capital==
[[Cultural capital]] is a concept, developed by sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]], that can refer to both achieved and ascribed characteristics. They are desirable qualities (either material or symbolic) that contribute to one's social status; any advantages a person has which give him/her a higher status in society.  It may include high expectations, forms of knowledge, skill, and education, among other things.

Parents provide children with cultural capital, the attitudes and knowledge that make the educational system a comfortable familiar place in which they can succeed easily.  There are other types of capital as well; [[Social capital]] refers to ones membership in groups, relationships, and networks.  It too can have a significant impact on achievement level.

===Education===
Industrialization has led to a vast increase in the possible standard of living for the average person but also made this increase necessary. For the productivity of the average worker to rise, he or she had to receive far more education and training. This successively made the average worker much less replaceable and therefore more powerful. Hence, it became necessary to satisfy workers’ demands for a larger share.

===Employment===
According to sociologist [[Rodney Stark]], few [[United States|Americans]] believe coming from a wealthy family or having political connections is necessary to get ahead. In contrast, many people in other industrialized nations think these factors are necessary for advancement. Americans are more likely than the people in these nations to rate “hard work” as very important for getting ahead. While most nations value hard work, the [[Italians]], for example, are hardly more likely to rate it as very important than they are to think one needs political connections.

===Income===
People with a lower income will generally be a better example of moving up in the [[social stratification]] and achieving status.  This holds to be evident in most cases because those who accrue a lower income usually have the motivation to achieve a greater status through their own ambitions and hard work.  Those of higher income are typically the result of achieving status.  In other cases the people of higher income may have unjustly acquired that position, or were ascribed the status and income they hold (such as monarchs, family run businesses, etc.).

Those without the privilege of ascribing their status will generally have the greater motivation of achieving their own status.  The general economic well being of the society the person lives in also tends to be another factor in their status and to what extent they are able to achieve their status.

For example, [[United States|Americans]] are less likely than people in other industrialized nations to object to current income variances. According to [[Rodney Stark]], in 1992, only twenty-seven percent of Americans strongly agreed that income disparities in their country were too large. In contrast, more than half of [[Russians]], [[Italians]], and [[Bulgarians]] agreed with this statement.

==In stratification systems around the world==

In all societies a person's social status is the result of both ascribed and achieved characteristics.  Societies differ markedly on several dimensions in this process: what attributes are used to assign status, the relative importance of ascribed versus achieved attributes, the overall potential for social mobility, the rates of mobility that actually occurred, and the barriers for particular sub-groups to enjoy upward mobility in that society.

==Cultural differences around the world==

===Medieval Europe===
One's status in [[medieval Europe]] was primarily based on ascription. People born into the noble class were likely to keep a high position and people born of peasants were likely to stay in a low position.  This political system is known as [[feudalism]] and does not allow for much [[social mobility]].

===Feudalism in Latin America===
Bolivia has had past newspaper advertisements that claimed to have land, animals and [[peasants]] for sale.  The peasants weren't necessarily slaves but placed in their [[social class]] and obligated to work due to their bind to the land they lived and farmed.  This sort of social interaction is based mainly on the people's strong belief of tradition and to uphold the actions of the past.  In 1971 [[Ernesto Laclau]] addressed the argument of whether Latin America was either under a social system of [[feudalism]] or [[capitalism]].  He determined that the social system was extremely different from the capitalistic system in [[Europe]] and America, so therefore Latin America would be more closely related to have a Feudalism approach to social interaction.

===Caste system===
{{main|Caste}}
The formation of hierarchy differs somewhere between the polarities of given and achieved status.&lt;ref&gt;Japan's Invisible Race: Caste in Culture and Personality, p.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=T0_EWolOfpUC&amp;pg=PA334&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false334], George A. De Vos, Hiroshi Wagatsuma&lt;/ref&gt; In [[caste]] systems, ascription is the overpowering basis for status. Traditional society in South Asia and other parts of the world such as Egypt, India, Japan, and others were composed of castes. Each group was limited to certain occupations. Low paying occupations such as collecting garbage, were reserved for one caste, whose members were excluded from holding any other occupation. Correspondingly, highly skilled occupations, such as being a priest, [[goldsmith]], were reserved for another caste. However, some people managed through talent and luck to rise above their given caste. For example, great aptitude as a soldier was often a way to reach a higher status.

The '''Ba'athist Arabization campaigns in North Iraq''' involved the forced displacement and cultural [[Arabization]] of minorities ([[Kurds in Iraq|Kurds]], [[Yazidis|Yezidis]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Shabak people|Shabaks]], [[Armenians in Iraq|Armenians]], [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmen]], [[Mandeans]]), in line with [[settler colonialism|settler colonialist]] policies, led by the [[Ba'athist Iraq|Ba'athist government of Iraq]] from the 1960s to the early 2000s, in order to shift the demographics of North Iraq towards Arab domination. The Iraqi [[Ba'ath Party|Ba'ath party]], first under [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]], and later [[Saddam Hussein]], engaged in active expulsion of minorities from the mid-1970s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = ABC-CLIO| isbn = 978-0-313-08378-5| last = Kelly| first = Michael J.| title = Ghosts of Halabja: Saddam Hussein and the Kurdish Genocide: Saddam Hussein and the Kurdish Genocide| chapter=1. Kurdistan |date = 2008-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 and 1979, 600 Kurdish villages were burned down and around 200,000 Kurds were deported to the other parts of the country.&lt;ref name="Farouk-Sluglett 24"&gt;{{cite paper |first=M. |last=Farouk-Sluglett |first2=P. |last2=Sluglett |first3=J. |last3=Stork |title=Not Quite Armageddon: Impact of the War on Iraq |work=MERIP Reports |date=July–September 1984 |page=24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaigns took place during the [[Iraqi–Kurdish conflict]], being largely motivated by the Kurdish-Arab ethnic and political conflict. The Baathist policies motivating those events are sometimes referred to as "internal colonialism",&lt;ref&gt;Rimki Basu (2012). ''International Politics: Concepts, Theories and Issues''. p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; described by Francis Kofi Abiew as a "Colonial 'Arabization'" program, including large-scale Kurdish deportations and forced Arab settlement in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Kofi Abiew (1991). ''The Evolution of the Doctrine and Practice of Humanitarian Intervention''. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Ba'athist Iraq|History of Iraq}}
The Yezidis, the Shabaks, the Mandeans and the Assyrians are ethno-religious minorities in Iraq and historically were concentrated in northern Iraq, and they are still sizeable populations there in the early 21st century, in line with more prominent ethnic groups of Kurds and Arabs.

Under the Iraqi Hashemite monarchy as well as the subsequent Republican regime, Yezidis were discriminated against: measures applied included the loss of land, military repression and efforts to force them into the central state's struggle against the Kurdish National Movement.&lt;ref&gt;ICG, "Iraq’s New Battlefront: The Struggle over Ninewa". Middle East Report No. 90, 28 September 2009, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policies==

===Displacement of minorities and Arab settlement===
{{see also|Destruction of Kurdish villages during the Iraqi Arabization campaign}}
From early 1975, under the regime of Saddam Hussein, both Kurds and Yazidis were confronted with village destruction, depopulation and deportation.&lt;ref name=savelberg&gt;Eva Savelsberg, Siamend Hajo, Irene Dulz. "Effectively Urbanized - Yezidis in the Collective Towns of Sheikhan and Sinjar". ''Etudes rurales'' 2010/2 (n°186). {{ISBN|9782713222955}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kurdish displacement in the North in the mid-1970s mostly took place in Sheikhan and Sinjar regions but also covered an area stretching from the town of Khanaqin.&lt;ref name=unami&gt;UNAMI, "Disputed Internal Boundaries: Sheikhan district", Volume 1, 2009, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The repressive measures carried out by the government against the Kurds after the [[1975 Algiers Agreement]] led to renewed [[PUK insurgency|clashes]] between the Iraqi Army and Kurdish guerrillas in 1977. In 1978 and 1979, 600 Kurdish villages were burned down, and around 200,000 Kurds were deported to the other parts of the country.&lt;ref name="Farouk-Sluglett 24" /&gt;

Arabization concentrated on moving Arabs to the vicinity of oil fields in Kurdistan, particularly the ones around Kirkuk.&lt;ref&gt;Harris (1977), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ba'athist government was also responsible for driving out at least 70,000 Kurds from the [[Mosul]]’s western half, thus making western Mosul into all Sunni Arab. In Sinjar, in late 1974, the former Committee for Northern Affairs ordered the confiscation of property, the destruction of the mostly Yezidi villages and the forced settlement into 11 new towns with Arab placenames that were constructed 30–40&amp;nbsp;km orth or south of Sinjar, or other parts of Iraq.&lt;ref name=savelberg /&gt; There were 37 Yezidi villages destroyed in the process&lt;ref name=savelberg /&gt; and five neighbourhoods in Sinjar Arabized in 1975.&lt;ref name=savelberg /&gt; The same year, 413 Muslim Kurd and Yezidi farmers were dispossessed of their lands by the government or had their agricultural contracts cancelled and replaced by Arab settlers.&lt;ref name=savelberg /&gt; In Sheikhan in 1975, 147 out of a total of 182 villages suffered forced displacement, and 64 villages were handed over to Arab settlers in the years following.&lt;ref name=savelberg /&gt; Seven new towns were built in Sheikhan to house the displaced Yezidi and Kurdish residents of Arabized villages.

As part of the [[Al-Anfal Campaign]], during the [[Iran–Iraq War]], [[Saddam Hussein]]'s régime destroyed 3,000 to 4,000 villages and drove hundreds of thousands of [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] to become refugees or be resettled across Iraq,&lt;ref name=unami/&gt; as well as [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansArt.nsf/V3Key/LC19930914036&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmselect/cmintdev/444/444ap06.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmen]]. Some 100,000 people were killed or died during the al-Anfal campaign, which is often equated to ethnic cleansing and genocide. The forced campaign of Arabization was an attempt to transform the historically multi-ethnic city of Kirkuk, with a strong Kurdish majority, into an Arab city. Kurdish families were left with no homes after being evicted forcefully by Saddam's Iraqi soldiers and so had to [[Kurdish refugees|migrate]] to refugee camps.

In the 1990s, the distribution of land to Arab settlers was resumed and continued until the fall of the Ba'ath regime, in 2003.&lt;ref name=savelberg /&gt;

===Cultural and political Arabization===
In the Iraqi censuses in 1977 and 1987, Yezidis were forced to register as Arabs and from the mid-1970s, Kurdish was prohibited from being spoken.&lt;ref name=savelberg/&gt; Some Muslim Kurds were also forced to register as Arabs in 1977.&lt;ref name=savelberg/&gt;

==Legal basis==
The legal basis for Arabization was the Revolutionary Command Council’s Decree (RCCD) No. 795 from 1975 and the RCCD No. 358 from 1978.&lt;ref name=savelberg/&gt; The former authorized the confiscation of property from members of the Kurdish National Movement, and the latter allowed invalidation of property deeds belonging to displaced Muslim Kurds and Yezidis, the nationalization of their land under the control of the Iraqi Ministry of Finance and the resettlement of the region by Arab families.&lt;ref name=savelberg/&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{Further|Kurdish refugees}}
After the fall of Saddam's regime, many Kurdish families came back to Kirkuk. The policies of [[Kurdification]] by [[KDP]] and [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan|PUK]] after 2003 aimed to reverse the previous trends of Arabization, with non-Kurds, especially Assyrians and Turkmen,&lt;nowiki/&gt; have prompted serious inter-ethnic problems.&lt;ref&gt;Stansfield, Gareth (2007). ''Iraq: People, History, Politics''. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kirkuk referendum plans===
The [[Kirkuk status referendum]] is the [[Kirkuk]] part of a plebiscite, that will decide whether the Kurdish regions within [[Iraq]]i [[governorates of Iraq|governorates]] of [[Diyala Governorate|Diyala]], [[Kirkuk Governorate|Kirkuk]], [[Salah ad Din Governorate|Salah ad Din]] and [[Ninawa]] (which has an [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] majority) will become part of the [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] [[regions of Iraq|region]]. The [[referendum]] was initially planned for 15 November 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.export.gov/Iraq/pdf/iraq_government.pdf Iraqi Council of Ministers Presented to the Parliament by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001111155/http://export.gov/Iraq/pdf/iraq_government.pdf |date=2013-10-01 }} www.export.gov/Iraq&lt;/ref&gt; but was delayed first to 31 December,&lt;ref name=iran&gt;[http://www.thenewanatolian.com/tna-29406.html Iran pleases Ankara, irks Kurds with call for Kirkuk poll delay], ''[[The New Anatolian]]'', 2007-11-08, accessed on 2008-03-01&lt;/ref&gt; and then by a further six months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stratfor.com/products/premium/read_article.php?id=300161 Members-Only Content | Stratfor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aina.org/news/20071217124429.htm Kirkuk, Other Iraq Issues to Be Delayed&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kurdish Alliance]] emphasized that the delay was for technical and not for political reasons.

The '''Bavarian Border Police''' ({{lang-de|Bayerische Grenzpolizei}} or ''GrePo'') is a police division within the [[Bavarian State Police]] (''Polizei Bayern''). It is the third arm of the [[police force]] alongside the [[state police]] and the so-called 'readiness police' (''[[Bereitschaftspolizei]]'') It existed from 1946 (independently from 1952) to 1998 and was responsible for the federal borders in [[Bavaria]]. It was re-established as an independent arm in 2018.

== History ==
In 1945 the Bavarian Border Police - then known as the Bavarian State Border Police (''Bayerische Landesgrenzpolizei'') - was reformed. The latter had existed from 1919 to 1934 in the shape of a Bavarian Border Police Commissariat on the borders between [[Lindau (Bodensee)|Lindau]] on [[Lake Constance]] and [[Cheb|Eger]]. Its reformation was authorised by VA No. 72 on 15 November 1945 which established a Bavarian State Border Police force, the order taking effect from 1 March 1946. The first units were deployed by the [[Allied-occupied Germany#American Zone of Occupation|American occupation powers]] as "Border Police".

On 15 March 1947 the overall responsibility for [[border control]] and implementation of Military Government Law No. 161 was transferred to the Bavarian Border Police. However the border police continued to receive their orders from the Military Government. The responsibility for checking members of the allied military forces and their dependents was exclusively carried out by American military personnel.

On 28 October 1952 the Bavarian Police Organisation law was passed. Articles 34 to 41 of this law governed the border police and their mission which was "The supervision and policing of the state borders, especially supervision of border traffic and carrying out the dispatch and reception of people, including the supervision of passengers at airports". Their departments were given descriptions that corresponded to those of the state police.

The last agreement over responsibilities vis-à-vis the [[Bundesgrenzschutz]] was spelt out by an administrative agreement dated 16 July 1975 between the [[Interior Ministry]] and the [[Landtag of Bavaria|Bavarian State Government]] which dealt with the exercise of tasks by the border police arm of the police service in Bavaria.

The only other German state that had its own [[border police]] in the [[post-war era]] was [[Hesse]], whose border force was operational on the Russian, British and French zones from 1945 until 1 October 1950, when it was officially absorbed into the state police. Events in the late 1980s signalled the end of the Bavarian Border Police. Austria's entry into the [[European Union|EU]] on 1 January 1995 and on 28 April 1995 to the [[Schengen Treaty]] fundamentally changed the situation on the Bavarian-Austrian border.

From 1 January 1997 border controls on traffic from Austria were lifted in stages.

== Disbandment ==
With the incorporation of the Bavarian Border Police into the Bavarian State Police their history came to an end on 31 March 1998. They were replaced by police departments that almost exclusively deal with cross-border traffic. These include: the Missing Persons Police Department (''Polizeiinspektion Fahndung'' or ''PIF'') with border police stations (GPS) and the Search and Inspection Force (''Fahndungs- und Kontrolltrupp'' or ''FKT''). FKT officials  are civilian and also work outside Bavaria in areas near the border. The border officers (''Grenzbeauftragter'') are the only vestige of the old border police that remains.

== Re-establishment in 2018==
Due to the [[European migrant crisis]] in 2015 and the establishment of permanent border controls to the Austrian border, the state border police has been re-established in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bayern.de/bericht-aus-der-kabinettssitzung-vom-23-maerz-2018/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pnp.de/lokales/stadt_und_landkreis_passau/passau_stadt/2994832_Festakt-Bayerische-Grenzpolizei-nimmt-heute-ihre-Arbeit-auf.html&lt;/ref&gt; The police force´s headquarter is based in [[Passau]], finally there will be a staff of about 1.000 officers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.br.de/nachrichten/soeder-will-bayerische-grenzpolizei-in-passau-stationieren-100.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/csu-passau-soll-hauptsitz-von-soeders-geplanter-grenzpolizei-werden-1.3866815&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merkur.de/politik/soeder-plant-dieses-mega-projekt-fuer-bayern-9536181.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article173553034/Plaene-vorgestellt-Soeder-will-Bayerns-Grenzen-mit-eigener-Polizei-schuetzen.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2074">A '''caucus revolt''' occurs when enough members of a political party pressure its leadership to step down or to remove planned bills,legislation or policies from its platform.  A caucus revolt generally concludes with the [[party leader]] resigning their position as such a revolt is usually seen to show poor leadership skills.  Often the mere appearance of a revolt in the caucus maybe enough to force a leader to step down.

In [[Westminster style legislatures|Westminster style governments]], if the party suffering from a caucus revolt is the current government, often an [[interim leader]] will be appointed by the party until a [[leadership convention]] can be held to elect a new leader, or a general election can be called should the party leader find a way to survive the revolt.

== Examples ==
{{Globalize/Canada|date=September 2018}}
The [[1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt]] against the premiership of [[William Aberhart]] in Alberta ultimately forced the premier to hand over considerable power to a committee of backbenchers, the [[Social Credit Board]].  The Board brought in British social credit "experts" who proposed radical legislation which led to a constitutional crisis when it was repeatedly blocked: first [[reservation and disallowance|disallowed]] by the federal government, then [[reservation and disallowance|reserved]] by [[Lieutenant-Governor]] [[John C. Bowen]], and ultimately struck down by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]].

After successfully leading the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] and being [[Prime Minister of Canada]] for over ten years, [[Jean Chrétien]] was forced to step down as both Party Leader and Prime Minister of Canada at the threat of a Caucus Revolt from his longtime [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]] and political rival, [[Paul Martin|Paul Martin Jr.]]

{{Democracy}}

'''Christian democracy''' is a political ideology that emerged in nineteenth-century Europe under the influence of [[Catholic social teaching]],{{sfn|Heywood|2012|p=83}}&lt;ref&gt;A. Galetto, Nino. ''Christian Democracy: Principles and Policy Making,'' Berlin, Konrad Adeneaur Stiftung, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Neo-Calvinism]].{{refn|group=nb|"This is the Christian Democratic tradition and the structural pluralist concepts that underlie it. The Roman Catholic social teaching of subsidiarity and its related concepts, as well as the parallel neo-Calvinist concept of sphere sovereignty, play major roles in structural pluralist thought."{{sfn|Monsma|2012|p=13}}&lt;br/&gt;"Concurrent with this missionary movement in Africa, both Protestant and Catholic political activists helped to restore democracy to war-torn Europe and extend it overseas. Protestant political activism emerged principally in England, the Lowlands, and Scandinavia under the inspiration of both social gospel movements and neo-Calvinism. Catholic political activism emerged principally in Italy, France, and Spain under the inspiration of both Rerum Novarum and its early progeny and of neo-Thomism. Both formed political parties, which now fall under the general aegis of the Christian Democratic Party movement. Both Protestant and Catholic parties inveighed against the reductionist extremes and social failures of liberal democracies and social democracies. Liberal democracies, they believed, had sacrificed the community for the individual; social democracies had sacrificed the individual for the community. Both parties returned to a traditional Christian teaching of "social pluralism" or "subsidiarity," which stressed the dependence and participation of the individual in family, church, school, business, and other associations. Both parties stressed the responsibility of the state to respect and protect the "individual in community."{{sfn|Witte|1993|p=9}}}} Christian democratic political ideology advocates for a commitment to [[social market]] principles and qualified interventionism. It was conceived as a combination of modern [[democracy|democratic]] ideas and [[Christian values|traditional Christian values]], incorporating the social teachings espoused by the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Calvinism|Reformed]], and [[Pentecostal]] traditions in various parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Freeden2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeden|first=Michael|title=Reassessing Political Ideologies: The Durability of Dissent|date=2 August 2004|publisher=Routledge|language=English |isbn=978-1-134-52146-3|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RobeckYong2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robeck|first1=Cecil M. |last2=Yong|first2=Amos|title=The Cambridge Companion to Pentecostalism|date=11 August 2014|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|language=English |isbn=9781316060643|page=178|quote=Pentecostals have also secured parliamentary representation, for example, in Australia, Colombia, Nicaragua, and Peru, and have helped form Christian political parties that have won parliamentary seats. A noteworthy case is Sweden's Christian Democrat Party, not only because it is in a continent where Pentecostals have struggled to make political headway but also because its Pentecostal founder, Lewi Pethrus, who challenged secularization by creating institutions to foster a Christian counterculture, was active at a time when Pentecostals in Sweden or the United States shunned politics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and Catholic movements of the [[Social Gospel]] and [[Neo-Thomism]], respectively, played a role in shaping Christian democracy.{{sfn|Witte|1993|p=9}} Christian democracy continues to be influential in [[Europe]] and [[Latin America]], although it is also present in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, Jan-Werner (2014). ''The End of Christian Democracy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, Christian democracy is often considered [[centre-right politics|centre-right]] on cultural, social, and moral issues (and is thus a supporter of [[social conservatism]]), and it is considered [[centre-left politics|centre-left]] "with respect to economic and labor issues, civil rights, and foreign policy" as well as the environment.&lt;ref name="Vervliet2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wankel2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wankel|first=Charles|title=Encyclopedia of Business in Today's World |year=2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|language=English |isbn=978-1-4129-6427-2|page=131 |quote=The basic tenets of Christian Democracy call for applying Christian principles to public policy; Christian Democratic parties tend to be socially conservative but otherwise left of center with respect to economic and labor issues, civil rights, and foreign policy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, with regard to its fiscal stance, Christian democracy advocates a [[social market economy]].&lt;ref name="Vervliet2009"/&gt;

Worldwide, many Christian democratic parties are members of the [[Centrist Democrat International]] and some also of the [[International Democrat Union]]. Examples of major Christian democratic parties include the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) in Germany, the [[Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP), [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s [[Fine Gael]], the [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile|Christian Democratic Party]] in [[Chile]], In the Caribbean, [[Aruban People's Party]] (AVP), [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA) from the Netherlands, The [[Switzerland]]'s [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|Christian Democratic People's Party]] and the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Van Hecke, Steven and Gerard, Emannuel. ''Christian Democratic Parties in Europe since the End of the Cold War'', Cornell Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today, many European Christian democratic parties are affiliated with the [[European People's Party]]. Those with [[Eurosceptic#Soft Euroscepticism|soft Eurosceptic]] views in comparison with the pro-European EPP are members of the [[Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe]], or the more right-wing [[European Christian Political Movement]]. Many Christian democratic parties in [[the Americas]] are affiliated with the [[Christian Democrat Organization of America]].

==Political viewpoints==
As a generalization, it can be said that Christian democratic parties in Europe tend to be moderately [[conservatism|conservative]], and in several cases form the main conservative party in their respective countries (e.g. in Germany, Spain, Belgium, and Switzerland: [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland]] (CVP), [[Christian Social Party (Switzerland)|Christian Social Party]] (CSP), [[Evangelical People's Party of Switzerland]] (EVP), and [[Federal Democratic Union of Switzerland]] (EDU)). In Latin America, by contrast, Christian democratic parties tend to be left-leaning and to some degree influenced by [[liberation theology]].&lt;ref name=Szulc&gt;{{cite journal |first=Tad |last=Szulc |title=Communists, Socialists and Christian Democrats |journal=[[Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]] |volume=360 |page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; These generalizations, however, must be nuanced by the consideration that Christian democracy does not fit precisely into the usual categories of political thought, but rather includes elements common to several other political ideologies, including [[conservatism]], [[liberalism]], and [[social democracy]].

===Economics===
Initially many Catholic political movements in the 19th century had opposed [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]] equally as both were seen as based on materialism and social conflict.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=60}} They instead preferred the ideal of self-sufficient peasants and the [[guild]]-organized craftsmen that many [[Rerum Novarum|Catholic encyclicals]] advocated. However by 1914, many of these movements had later reconciled themselves to capitalism as the prevailing economic system while at the same time helping to organize Catholic workers and peasants within that system, as socialism became to be seen as the greater threat.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=60}}

Consequently, this has led the [[social market economy]] which has been widely influential across much of continental Europe. The social market is a largely free market economy based on a [[free price system]] and private property, but is supportive of government activity to promote competitive markets with a comprehensive [[Social welfare|social welfare system]] and effective public services to address social inequalities that result from free market outcomes.{{sfn|Turner|2008|pp=83-84}} The market is seen not so much an end in itself but as a means of generating wealth in order to achieve broader social goals and to maintain societal cohesion.{{sfn|Adams|2012|p=84}} This particular model of capitalism, which is sometimes called Rhine–Alpine capitalism or ''social capitalism'', is contrasted to Anglo-American capitalism or ''enterprise capitalism''. Whereas the former stresses partnership and cooperation, the latter is based on the unrestricted workings of market economics and as a consequence there is a willingness on the part of Christian democratic parties to practice [[Keynesian]] and [[welfarist]] policies.{{sfn|Adams|2012|p=84}} 

In recent decades, however, some right-leaning Christian democratic parties in Europe have adopted policies consistent with an [[economic liberalism|economically liberal]] point of view but still supporting a regulated economy with a welfare state, while by contrast other Christian democrats at times seem to hold views similar to [[Christian socialism]], or the economic system of [[distributism]]. The promotion of the Christian Democratic concepts of sphere sovereignty and subsidiarity led to the creation of corporatist welfare states throughout the world that continue to exist to this day.&lt;ref name="BakHolthoon1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bak|first1=Hans |last2=Holthoon |first2= F.L. van |last3=Krabbendam |first3=Hans |author4= Edward L. Ayers |title=Social and Secure?: Politics and Culture of the Welfare State: a Comparative Inquiry|date=1 January 1996|publisher=VU University Press|language=English |isbn=9789053834589|quote=The Christian democrats promoted a corporatist welfare state, based on the principles of the so-called "sphere sovereignty" and "subsidiarity" in social policy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the Christian Democratic concepts of the [[cultural mandate]] and the [[preferential option for the poor]], Christian justice is viewed as demanding that the welfare of all people, especially the poor and vulnerable, must be protected because every human being has dignity, being made in the image of God.&lt;ref name="Vervliet2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mainwaring2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mainwaring|first=Scott|title=Christian Democracy in Latin America: Electoral Competition and Regime Conflicts|year=2003|publisher=Stanford University Press|language=English |isbn=9780804745987|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, Christian Democrats organized labor unions that competed with Communist and social democratic unions, in contrast to conservativism's stance against worker organizations. Standing in solidarity with these labor unions, In Belgium for example, Christian Democrats have lobbied for Sunday [[blue laws]] that guarantee workers, as well as civil servants, a day of rest in line with historic [[Sabbatarianism|Christian Sabbath principles]].&lt;ref name="WitteCraeybeckx2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witte|first1=Els|last2=Craeybeckx|first2=Jan|last3=Meynen|first3=Alain|title=Political History of Belgium: From 1830 Onwards|year=2009|publisher=ASP-VUB Press|language=English|isbn=9789054875178|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social policies===
Christian democrats are usually [[social conservatism|socially conservative]], and, as such, generally have a relatively skeptical stance towards [[abortion]] and [[same-sex marriage]], though some Christian democratic parties have accepted the limited legalization of both. Christian Democrats have also supported the [[prohibition of drugs]].&lt;ref name="KerboStrasser2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kerbo|first1=Harold R.|last2=Strasser|first2=Hermann|title=Modern Germany|year=2000|publisher=McGraw Hill|language=English |isbn=9780072928198|quote=Conservatives, including the Christian Democrats, favor an abstinence strategy that aims at a controlled use of legal drugs such as alcohol, nicotine, and medical drugs, on the one hand, and prohibiting the use of illegal drugs (whether soft or hard), on the other.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ColemanKerbo2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleman|first1=James William|last2=Kerbo|first2=Harold R.|last3=Ramos|first3=Linda L.|title=Social Problems|date=1 June 2001|publisher=Prentice Hall|language=English|isbn=9780130413734|quote=Conservatives, including the Christian Democrats, favor...the prohibition of all other drugs (whether "soft" or "hard" ) on the other.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian democratic parties are often likely to assert the [[Christianity|Christian]] heritage of their country, and to affirm explicitly [[Christian ethics]], rather than adopting a more liberal or secular stance;&lt;ref name="Kersbergen2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kersbergen|first=Kees van|title=Social Capitalism: A Study of Christian Democracy and the Welfare State|date=2 September 2003|publisher=Routledge|language=English|isbn=978-1-134-81834-1|page=63|quote=The main ideological and integrative theme present from the start concerned an emphasis on general Christian values, both as a moral rejection of the atheist, immoral and materialist Nazism and as a manner of distinction vis à vis social democracy. The thrust of the Christian democratic argument was that politics had to be founded in Christianity and that a moral recovery was a prerequisite for social and economic recuperation. It was imperative to concede the importance of Christian ethics after an epoch of such inhuman and atheist cruelty (Heidenheimer 1960:33-4; Mintzel 1982:133).}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time, Christian Democratic parties enshrine [[confessional liberty]].&lt;ref name="Schindler2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schindler|first=Jeanne Heffernan|title=Christianity and Civil Society: Catholic and Neo-Calvinist Perspectives|year=2008|publisher=Lexington Books|language=English|isbn=9780739108840|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Democracy fosters an "[[ecumenical]] unity achieved on the religious level against the [[state atheism|atheism]] of the government in the Communist countries."&lt;ref name="Dussel1981"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dussel|first=Enrique|title=A History of the Church in Latin America|year=1981|publisher=Wm.

A rejection of [[secularism]], and an emphasis on the fact that the individual is part of a community and has duties towards it. An emphasis on the community, social justice and solidarity, support for a [[welfare state]], [[labor unions]] and support for regulation of market forces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.civita.no/assets/2011/04/pdf-100-Tre-essays-om-kristendemokrati-001.pdf Tre essays om Kristendemokrati] (Three essays about Christian democracy), Prof. Janne Haaland Matlary, Pål Veiden and David Hansen&lt;/ref&gt; Most European Christian Democrats reject the concept of [[class struggle]] (although less so in some Latin American countries, which have been influenced by [[liberation theology]]), opposing both excessive State institutions and unregulated capitalism in favor of robust non-governmental, non-profit, intermediary institutions to deliver social services and [[social insurance]].

Geoffrey K. Roberts and Patricia Hogwood have noted that "Christian democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals, conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and Christian principles."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts and Hogwood, ''European Politics Today'', Manchester University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Democrats hold that the various sectors of society (such as education, family, economy and state) have autonomy and responsibility over their own sphere, a concept known as [[sphere sovereignty]].&lt;ref name="Monsma2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Monsma|first=Stephen V.|title=Pluralism and Freedom: Faith-based Organizations in a Democratic Society|year=2012|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|language=English |isbn=9781442214309|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; One sphere ought not to dictate the obligations of another social entity; for example, the sphere of the state is not permitted to interfere with the raising of children, a role that belongs to sphere of the family.&lt;ref name="Monsma2012"/&gt; Within the sphere of government, Christian Democrats maintain that civil issues should first be addressed at the lowest level of government before being examined at a higher level, a doctrine known as [[subsidiarity]].&lt;ref name="Vervliet2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vervliet|first=Chris|title=Human Person|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Adonis &amp; Abbey|language=English|isbn=9781912234196|page=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; These concepts of sphere sovereignty and subsidiarity are considered to be cornerstones of Christian Democracy political ideology.&lt;ref name="Lamberts1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamberts|first=Emiel|title=Christian Democracy in the European Union, 1945/1995: Proceedings of the Leuven Colloquium, 15-18 November 1995|year=1997|publisher=Leuven University Press|language=English|isbn=9789061868088|page=401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As advocates of environmentalism, Christian democrats support the principle of [[Stewardship (theology)|stewardship]], which upholds the idea that humans should safeguard the planet for future generations of life.&lt;ref name="Vervliet2009"/&gt;

==History==
===19th century===
The origins of Christian democracy go back to the [[French Revolution]], initially French republicanism and the Catholic church were deeply indifferent to one another as the revolutionary government had attacked the church, confiscated the church's lands, persecuted its priests and had attempted to establish a new religion around reason and the supreme being.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=59}} After the decades following the French revolution, the Catholic church saw the rise of [[liberalism]] as a threat to catholic values. The rise of capitalism and the resulting industrialization and urbanization of society were seen to be destroying the traditional communal and family life. According to the catholic church [[Economic liberalism|liberal economics]] promoted selfishness and materialism with the liberal emphasis on individualism, tolerance, and free expression enabled all kinds of self-indulgence and permissiveness to thrive.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=59}}

Consequently for much of the 19th century the Catholic church was hostile to democracy and liberalism, later however many political catholic movements were formed in European countries advocating reconciling Catholicism with liberalism if not democracy.
From about the 1870s political Catholicism emerged based on the idea that it was to the Church's advantage to participate in the modern political process,{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=60}} and it became a significant force in Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and Austria. These catholic political movements tended to have many similar policies of opposition to liberal secularism, civil marriage and state control of education. They were against the common view across all forms of liberalism that church and state must be separated,{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=60}} consequently they were also closely connected to the church and confined to the faithful. There was no implied commitment to democracy, these movements merely made use of the political system to the advantage of what they believed to be was right with their ideal goal being the church having a privileged position in the state with it being able to influence policy.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=60}}

Largely as a result of the [[Pope|papal]] encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' of [[Pope Leo XIII]], in which the [[Holy See|Vatican]] recognized workers' misery and agreed that something should be done about it, in reaction to the rise of the [[socialism|socialist]] and [[trade union]] movements. The position of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on this matter was further clarified in subsequent encyclicals, such as ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'', by [[Pope Pius XI]] in 1931, ''[[Populorum progressio]]'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1967, ''[[Centesimus annus]]'', by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1991, and ''[[Caritas in veritate]]'' by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2009.&lt;ref name=Sturzo&gt;Sturzo, L. (1947) 'The Philosophic Background of Christian Democracy', ''The Review of Politics'', 9(1), pp. 3–15, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, "Protestant political activism emerged principally in England, the Lowlands, and Scandinavia under the inspiration of both [[social gospel]] movements and [[neo-Calvinism]]".{{sfn|Witte|1993|p=9}} After [[World War II]], "both Protestant and Catholic political activists helped to restore democracy to war-torn Europe and extend it overseas".{{sfn|Witte|1993|p=9}} [[John Witte Jr.|John Witte]] explaining the origin of Christian democracy, states that:
{{quotation|Both Protestant and Catholic parties inveighed against the reductionist extremes and social failures of liberal democracies and social democracies. Liberal democracies, they believed, had sacrificed the community for the individual; social democracies had sacrificed the individual for the community. Both parties returned to a traditional Christian teaching of "social pluralism" or "subsidiarity," which stressed the dependence and participation of the individual in family, church, school, business, and other associations. Both parties stressed the responsibility of the state to respect and protect the "individual in community."{{sfn|Witte|1993|p=9}}}}

As such, Christian democracy has been adopted by Roman Catholics as well as many [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] Christians. Christian democracy has evolved considerably since then, and it is no longer the Catholic ideology of [[distributism]], although it is based on Catholic social teaching, as outlined in the 2006 official "Catechism of the Social Doctrine of the Catholic Church". (In Germany, for example, the Christian Democratic Party emerged as a grouping dominated by Rhenish and Westphalian Catholics, but also encompassed the more conservative elements of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] population.) Following [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], Christian democracy was seen as a neutral and unifying voice of compassionate conservatism, and distinguished itself from the [[far right]]. It gave a voice to "conservatives of the heart", particularly in Germany, who had detested [[Adolf Hitler]]'s regime yet agreed with the right on many issues.

In [[Protestantism|Protestant]] countries, Christian democratic parties were founded by more conservative Protestants in reaction to secularization.&lt;ref name="RobeckYong2014"/&gt; In the Netherlands, for instance, the [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] was founded in 1879 by conservative Protestants; it institutionalized early 19th century opposition against the ideas from the [[French Revolution]] on popular sovereignty and held that government derived its authority from God, not from the people. This [[Edmund Burke|Burke]]an position is sometimes also called Christian Historian. It was a response to the liberal ideas that predominated in political life. The [[Christian Democrats (Sweden)|Christian Democrats of Sweden]], rooted in the [[Pentecostal]] religious tradition, has a similar history.&lt;ref name="RobeckYong2014"/&gt;

Some Christian democratic parties, particularly in Europe, no longer emphasize religion and have become much more [[secular]] in recent years. Also within Europe, two essentially Islamic parties, the [[Democratic League of Kosovo]] and Turkey's ruling [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (usually known by the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] acronym AKP, for ''Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi'') have moved towards the tradition. The Democratic League of Kosovo is now a full member of the Centrist Democrat International ''(see [[#Christian democracy around the world|below]])''. {{Citation needed|reason=LDK is not on the list of http://idc-cdi.com/en/parties/|date=June 2017 }}

Christian democracy can trace its philosophical roots back to [[Thomas Aquinas]] and his thoughts on [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[ontology]] and the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition.{{sfn|Witte|1993|p=9}} According to Aquinas, [[human rights]] are based on [[natural law]] and defined as the things that humans need to function properly. For example, food is a human right because without food humans cannot function properly. Modern authors important to the formation of Christian democratic ideology include [[Emmanuel Mounier]], [[Étienne Gilson]], and [[Jacques Maritain]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Christian Democratic initiatives based on its philosophy also have practical and political results in the movement's direction.  Christian Democrats believe in the importance of intermediary organizations that operate in between the individual and the state.  Therefore, they support labor unions but in many countries organized their own Christian trade unions separate from socialist unions.  These unions in turn formed the strong left wing of many CD parties.  Christian democratic opposition to secularism and support of religious organizations as intermediary organizations led to support for church operated schools, hospitals, charities and even social insurance funds. This resulted in strong Christian Democratic support for the government (or mandatory payroll tax) social welfare funding of these institutions.

{{Main|List of Christian democratic parties}}

The international organization of Christian democratic parties, the [[Centrist Democrat International]] (CDI), formerly known as the Christian Democratic International, is the second largest international political organization in the world (second only to the [[Socialist International]]). European Christian democratic parties have their own regional organization called the [[European People's Party]], which form the largest group in the [[European Parliament]], the [[European People's Party Group]].

}}
Christian democracy has been especially important in [[Politics of Chile|Chile]] ''(see [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile]])'' and Venezuela (see [[COPEI]]{{snd}} Christian Democratic Party of Venezuela), among others, and partly also in [[Politics of Mexico|Mexico]], starting with the ascendancy of [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Vicente Fox]] in 2000, followed by [[Felipe Calderón]] ''(see [[National Action Party (Mexico)]])''. Cuba counts with several Christian democratic political associations, both on the island and in exile. The most significant is perhaps the Movimiento Cristiano de Liberación (MCL) led by Cuban dissident [[Oswaldo Payá]], who was killed in a tragic automobile accident in the summer of 2012 and has been nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. In Uruguay, the [[Christian Democratic Party of Uruguay]], although numerically small, was instrumental in the creation of the leftist [[Broad Front (Uruguay)|Broad Front]] in 1971.

===Australia===
Christian democratic parties in Australia include the [[Christian Democratic Party (Australia)|Christian Democratic Party]], the [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labor Party]] (regarded by some as a social democratic party), and the former [[Family First Party]] (regarded by some as a liberal democratic party).

In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and NSW [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) state executive members, parliamentarians and branch members associated (rightly or wrongly) with the Industrial Groups or [[B.&amp;nbsp;A. Santamaria]] and The Movement, were expelled from the party (against that party's rules). They formed a new party, soon to be known as the [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]] (DLP). Later in 1957, a similar split occurred in [[Queensland]], with the resulting group subsequently joining the DLP. The party also had sitting members from [[Tasmania]] and [[New South Wales]] at various times, though it was much stronger in the former mentioned states.

The party was in agreement with the ruling conservative [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] and [[National Party of Australia|Country]] parties on many issues, which resulted in their [[Ranked voting systems|preferencing]] of these parties over the ALP. However, it was more morally conservative, militantly anti-communist and socially compassionate than the Liberals. The DLP was defeated by the federal election of 1974 that saw its primary vote cut by nearly two thirds, and the entry of an ALP government. The DLP never regained its previous support in subsequent elections and formally disbanded in 1978, but a small group within the party refused to accept this decision and created a small, reformed successor party.

Though his party was effectively gone, Santamaria and his National Civic Council took a strong diametrically opposed stance to dominant [[Third Way]]/[[neoliberal]]/[[New Right]] tendencies within both the ALP and Liberal parties throughout the eighties and early nineties.

In 2006, the new DLP experienced a resurgence. The successor party struggled through decades of Victorian elections before finally gaining a parliamentary seat when the Victorian upper house was redesigned. Nevertheless, its electoral support is still very small in Victoria (around 2%). It has recently reformed state parties in Queensland and New South Wales. In the [[Australian federal election, 2010]], the DLP won the sixth senate seat in Victoria, giving it representation in the [[Australian Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;'It's official – DLP wins Vic Senate seat', ''Australian Conservative'', {{cite web |url=http://australianconservative.com/2010/09/its-official-%E2%80%93-dlp-wins-vic-senate-seat/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214101127/http://australianconservative.com/2010/09/its-official-%E2%80%93-dlp-wins-vic-senate-seat/ |archivedate=14 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Christian party that found strength in 1981 was the [[Christian Democratic Party (Australia)|Christian Democratic Party]] (initially known as the "Call to Australia" party). It gained 9.1% of the vote in the [[New South Wales]] (NSW) state election of 1981. This Protestant party had some very similar social policies to the [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|DLP]]. Its support base has generally been restricted to NSW and [[Western Australia]], where it usually gains between 2–4% of votes, with its support being minuscule in other states. It has had two members of the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|NSW Legislative Council]] for most of its existence and currently holds the Balance of Power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdp.org.au/|title=Home ⋆ Christian Democratic Party|website=Christian Democratic Party|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Christian Democratic Party (Australia)|CDP]] saw a surge in support during the 2016 Federal Election with a 96% increase in NSW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdp.org.au/media-releases/2016-federal-election-results-update/|title=2016 Federal Election Results Update|last=|first=|date=|website=cdp.org.au|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Australian Christian democratic party of note is the [[Family First Party]]. It has had one or two members in the SA parliament since 2002, and in 2004 also managed to elect a Victorian senator. Its electoral support is small, with the largest constituencies being [[South Australia]] (4–6%), and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (around 4%). Family First generally receives lower support in national elections than in state elections. [[Family First Party|Family First]] was merged with the [[Australian Conservatives]] Party in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-25/cory-bernardi-australian-conservatives-family-first-to-merge/8471244|title=Bernardi's Australian Conservatives to merge with Family First|date=2017-04-25|work=ABC News|access-date=2017-10-20|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
In the [[United States]], the [[American Solidarity Party]] is a minor third party which identifies as a Christian democratic party.&lt;ref name="Longenecker2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aleteia.org/2016/05/12/is-it-time-for-an-american-christian-democracy-party/|title=Is It Time for a US Christian Democracy Party?|last=Longenecker|first=Dwight|date=12 May 2016|publisher=Aleteia|language=English|accessdate=5 July 2016|quote=In 2011 the Christian Democratic Party USA was formed, and after the 2012 election it was re-named as the American Solidarity Party. Small political parties in the United States do not have a great track record, but given the choices available to Christians, the American Solidarity Party may offer a way to vote according to one's conscience and according to their simple motto: Common Good. Common Ground. Common Sense.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Community Food Security Coalition''' was a [[North America]]n [[non-profit]] made up of 325 member organizations who focus on social and economic justice, the environment, nutrition, [[sustainable agriculture]], community development, labor, anti-poverty, and anti-hunger initiatives. The coalition was dedicated to building strong, sustainable, local and regional food systems to ensure access to affordable, nutritious, and culturally appropriate food to all people at all times. The organization encouraged a system for [[food sovereignty]] grounded in the principles of justice, democracy, and sustainability. The coalition sought to further these goals through a comprehensive approach of policy advocacy, education and networking, and technical training.

CFSC worked with The California Food and Justice Coalition, supported a national Farm to School and Farm to College network, and advocated for sustainable and equitable national food policies in Washington, DC. Members of the coalition were involved in a number of committees that focus on various aspects of community food security work such as food retail, food and faith, international links, and [[urban agriculture]]. The coalition supported community food projects by advocating for and providing assistance to groups receiving or applying to the Community Food Projects Competitive Grants Program.

On August 6, 2012, the board announced that the organization would transfer projects to other organizations and close.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foodsecurity.org/important-message-from-cfsc/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903201426/http://foodsecurity.org/important-message-from-cfsc/ |date=September 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Competitiveness Policy Council''' was an independent federal advisory committee chartered in 1988 to advise the president and the Congress on more effective policies to promote U.S. [[competitiveness]].  The council had a unique quadrapartite membership composed of representatives from business, labor, government, and the public.

The council began operation in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Stokes, "Is Industrial Policy Now Mentionable," ''The National Journal'', March 7, 1992, p. 576.&lt;/REf&gt; and ceased operation in 1997 after the Republican-led Congress failed to continue funding, and after council members decided to close out this successful experiment in the independent advisory function.
== Authority ==

Authority for the council is found in the Competitiveness Policy Council Act, 15 U.S.C. §4801 et seq.  This act was part of the larger [[Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act]] of 1988.  The authorization of appropriations for the council expired in Fiscal year 1992, but otherwise the statutory underpinnings for the council remain intact, and the council could be revived by a future president with a pro-competitive agenda.

== Notable accomplishments==

During its years in operation, the Competitiveness Policy Council prepared and issued four Reports to the President and Congress.  They were:
*Building a Competitive America (1992)&lt;ref name="Competitiveness Policy Council 1992"&gt;Competitiveness Policy Council, "Building A Competitive America," First Report to the President and Congress, March 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A Competitiveness Strategy for America (1993)&lt;ref name="Competitiveness Policy Council 1993"&gt;Competitiveness Policy Council, "A Competitiveness Strategy for America," Second Report to the President &amp; Congress, March 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Promoting Long-Term Prosperity (1994)&lt;ref name="Competitiveness Policy Council 1994"&gt;Competitiveness Policy Council, "Promoting Long-Term Prosperity," Third Report to the President &amp; Congress, May 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Saving More and Investing Better (1995)&lt;ref name="Competitiveness Policy Council 1995"&gt;Competitiveness Policy Council, "Saving More and Investing Better: A Strategy for Securing Prosperity," Fourth Report to the President &amp; Congress, September 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The council adopted a broad approach to American competitiveness defining it as the ability of the United States to produce goods and services that meet the test of international markets while its citizens earn a standard of living that is both rising and sustainable over the long run.&lt;ref&gt; Competitiveness Policy Council, "Building A Competitive America," First Report to the President and Congress, March 1992 (page 2).&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition differed from others in that era which emphasized the trade balance rather than the overall impact of governmental policies on national economic prosperity.  The council's first report, "Building a Competitive America" (March 1992) explained that "three elements permeate our society and most directly hurt our competitive position: short-termism, [[perverse incentive]]s, and absence of global thinking."&lt;ref&gt;Competitiveness Policy Council, "Building A Competitive America," First Report to the President and Congress, March 1992 (page 11).  The council's first report was reviewed in Michael Prowse, "US 'needs new vision' to hone competitive edge: A federal advisory council, is calling for a radical reappraisal for industry," ''Financial Times'', March 5, 1992, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

To help analyze the problems of faltering U.S. competitiveness, the council in its first year, established eight subcouncils to study and recommend solutions for the most critical problems hindering U.S. competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Competitiveness Policy Council, "Building A Competitive America," First Report to the President and Congress, March 1992 (pages 35-36).&lt;/ref&gt; These subcouncils were: capital formation, education, training, public infrastructure, corporate governance and financial markets, trade policy, manufacturing, and critical technologies.  Additional subcouncils were established in later years.

== Leadership, composition, and appointments ==

The council was led by Dr. [[C. Fred Bergsten]], then the Director of the [[Institute for International Economics]] (now the [[Peterson Institute]]).&lt;ref&gt;The full name is the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics.&lt;/ref&gt;   Chairman Bergsten was elected by nongovernmental Council members at the first meeting.  The council was composed of 12 members who were appointed through a well-crafted process dictated by statute&lt;ref name="See 15 U.S.C. § 4804"&gt;See 15 U.S.C. § 4804&lt;/ref&gt;  that provided for quadrapartite and bipartisan representation.  Specifically, there were three members from the business community, three from organized labor, three from federal or state government, and three from academia and public interest.  Four members were appointed by the president, four by the [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives]] and the Minority Leader acting jointly, and four by the Majority and Minority leaders of the U.S. Senate acting jointly.&lt;ref name="See 15 U.S.C. § 4804"/&gt;   

Both Presidents [[George H.W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]] made appointments.  The appointments process for the council was unusual, in providing for equal weight to representatives from business and labor.&lt;ref name="See 15 U.S.C. § 4804"/&gt;

Over its life, the members of the council and key staff included:

== Charter ==

The council's statutory legislative charter contains a number of innovative administrative features.  For example, one duty of the council is to create a "forum" where national leaders with experience could identify and development recommendations to address actual problems facing America.&lt;ref&gt; See 15 U.S.C. § 4803(4)&lt;/ref&gt;  The council is empowered to hold hearings and to establish Subcouncils on any issue.  An unusual provision of the CPC Act provides that any discussion at the Subcouncil shall not be considered to violate any Federal or state antitrust law.&lt;ref&gt;See 15 U.S.C. § 4806(g)(5)&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of the Competitiveness Policy Council (CPC) was inspired, in part, by the favorable reception to the 1985 Report of the President's Commission on Industrial Competitiveness (chaired by [[John A. Young]]).  A year following the Young Commission Report, a private sector Council on Competitiveness was set up, which remains in existence. The CPC developed a cooperative relationship with the Council on Competitiveness which enhanced the CPC's work product.  The two Councils were easily distinguishable, however, in that the membership of the federally established CPC included a federal cabinet-level official and s state elected official. Thus, the deliberation of the CPC was able to benefit from the input of governmental members.  By contrast, the private-sector Council on Competitiveness lacks governmental members.

== Important recommendations ==

The council made a number of important recommendations during its years of operation regarding pensions, education, public investment, trade negotiations, and many other issues.&lt;ref&gt;See "American Competitiveness," ''The Washington Post'', March 5, 1992, Editorial, p. A22.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the recommendations by the council were not adopted.  For example, the council recommended  an immediate implementation of the provision in federal law calling for the Executive Branch to attach a "competitiveness impact statement" to any new legislative proposal to the Congress which may affect U.S. competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;See 2 U.S.C. § 194(b)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Competitiveness Council Reports." Facts on File World News Digest, March 19, 1992 (page 192 C1). &lt;/ref&gt;  This recommendation was not adopted. The council also championed the centrality of manufacturing in any national competitiveness strategy. The Obama Administration picked up on this recommendation in September 2009 when the President appointed the first White House counselor for manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt; Jon Schmitz, "Former  USW Official Joins White House as Manufacturing Counselor," Pittsburgh-Post Gazette, Sept. 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demise of the council ==

In April 1996, the U.S. Congress approved a $50,000 appropriation for the council, but also provided that "this shall be the final Federal payment to the Competitiveness Policy Council."&lt;ref&gt;Public Law 104-134, at page 110 Stat. 1321–48.&lt;/ref&gt;   In July 1996, a Report of the House Appropriations Committee withheld new funding for the council for FY1997, and noted that "the Committee believes that the Council is duplicative of private sector organizations, such as the Council on Competitiveness, which focus on the same issues without the use of Federal funds."&lt;ref&gt;House Report 104–676, Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, Fiscal year 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Situationists |expanded=Figures}}

'''Constant Anton Nieuwenhuys''' (21 July 1920 – 1 August 2005), better known as '''Constant''', was a Dutch painter, sculptor, graphic artist, author and musician.

==Early period==
Constant was born in [[Amsterdam]] on 21 July 1920 as the first son of Pieter Nieuwenhuijs and Maria Cornelissen. Their second son, [[Jan Nieuwenhuys]], was born a year later. Both sons became artists although their parents had no apparent interest in art.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"&gt;Constant, une rétrospective, Musée Picasso Antibes, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young child Constant drew passionately and showed great talent. He read literature with a special preference for poetry and played musical instruments. During his teenage years he learned to sing and to read music while in the church choir at a [[Jesuit]] school. In his later years, greatly inspired by [[gypsy style|gypsy music]], he only played improvised music. He played guitar, violin and at 45 years of age also mastered playing the [[cimbalon]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Trudy van der Horst, Constant. De Late Periode, BnM uitgevers, Nijmegen, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Constant painted his first oil painting, ''De Emmaüsgangers'', at age sixteen. It depicted the revelation of Jesus to two of his followers in [[Emmaus]]. With no money to buy materials he painted this painting on a [[jute]] sugar bag with pigments he had bought from a house painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kunstkanaal.net/film/constant.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120803070427/http://www.kunstkanaal.net/film/constant.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-08-03 |title=constant |publisher=Kunstkanaal.net |date= |accessdate=2012-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Constant's early drawings and paintings are religiously inspired, due to his Jesuit schooling. Yet at the age of twenty Constant turned his back on Catholicism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

After one year studying at the Kunstnijverheidsschool (Arts and Crafts School), Constant attended the Rijksakademie voor Beeldende Kunst (State Academy of Fine Arts) from 1939 to 1941. This education in craftmanship was put to use especially during his "New Babylon" period, when Constant built many constructions and models.

Constant lived and worked in [[Bergen, North Holland|Bergen]] from 1941 to 1943. Through the [[Bergense School]] he was introduced to the work of [[Paul Cézanne]], which impacted him deeply, as evident in ''Zelfportret'' (Self Portrait), 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galerienieuwschoten.nl/constant%20nieuwenhuys%20zelfportret.html |title=Constant Nieuwenhuys Zelfportret |publisher=Galerienieuwschoten.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1946"&gt;M. Hummelink, Après Nous La Liberté. Constant en de artistieke avant-garde in de jaren 1946-1960, [[Universiteit van Amsterdam]], 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Bergen was evacuated by the Germans in 1943 and so Constant and his wife Matie van Domselaer, whom he married in July 1942, moved back to Amsterdam. During this period Constant went into hiding and refrained from registering at the [[Kulturkammer]] (Nazi Chamber of Culture) to avoid the [[Arbeitseinsatz]] (labour supply for the Germans). Because of this he was unable to conventionally exercise his craft or to buy art supplies. To paint Constant used tablecloths and bed linen and had to rinse them out to start again.

During the war Constant's brother in law, Jaap van Domselaer, moved into the apartment to hide from the 'Arbeitseinsatz.' He introduced Constant to [[Plato]], [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx|Marx]]. Especially the latter provided great inspiration to Constant regarding his later ideas on art and society.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1946"/&gt;

During the [[Dutch famine of 1944|winter famine of 1944]] Constant's first son, Victor Nieuwenhuys, was born. After the war, Constant, his wife and son moved back to Bergen only to return to Amsterdam in 1946 where they lived in an apartment across from the zoo [[Natura Artis Magistra|Artis]]. When the war ended Constant was able to expand and grow as an artist after years of captivity and limitations. He liberated himself artistically and experimented with multiple techniques of art-making. He was inspired by [[Cubism]], especially by [[Georges Braque]]. In 1946 his daughter Martha was born, followed by his daughter Olga in 1948.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"/&gt;

==CoBrA==
In 1946 Constant travelled to Paris for the first time where he met the young Danish painter [[Asger Jorn]]. The friendship between Jorn and Constant later formed the basis for the avant-garde movement CoBrA.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1977"&gt;Fanny Kelk, Constant, G.I.N. Gallery, Amsterdam 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

July 1948 Constant founded Reflex ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Experimentele Groep in Holland|nl}}'' with [[Guillaume Cornelis van Beverloo|Corneille]], [[Karel Appel]] and his brother [[Jan Nieuwenhuys]]. The first edition of the magazine ''Reflex'' was published with a manifesto written by Constant. For Constant art had to be experimental. He had deducted this from the French word 'expérience' and believed that art springs from experience of the artist and is continuously changing. In the manifesto he stated that the process of creation is more important to the experimental artist than the work itself; it is a means to reach spiritual and mental enrichment. Also, the work of experimental artists is a mirror image of changes in the general perception of beauty.&lt;ref name="Hummelink 1995"&gt;M. Hummelink, Constant. Paintings 1948-1995, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Constant, Corneille and Appel, three totally different characters and artists, were united in their quest for innovation. They exhibited their work together and were often seen together in the European art scene. The wanderlust of the three is especially notorious.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"&gt;De A van CoBrA in Woord en Beeld, Jaski Art Gallery, Amsterdam, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the year 1948 on the terrace of café Notre Dame in Paris the ''Experimentele Groep in Holland'' linked up with [[Christian Dotremont]] and [[Joseph Noiret]] from Belgium and [[Asger Jorn]] from Denmark to form [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|CoBrA]], a name which was made by Dotremont, formed by the first letters of their hometowns: Copenhagen, Brussels and Amsterdam. The members opposed aesthetics in painting and bourgeois art in general.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1977"/&gt;

Constant had already outlined their ideas in his manifesto in ''Reflex'' magazine. This manifesto contains another of his famous quotes: "A painting is not a structure of colours and lines, but an animal, a night, a cry, a man, or all of these together".&lt;ref&gt;Fanny Kelk, Constant, G.I.N. Gallery, Amsterdam 1977, p1&lt;/ref&gt;

Constant was productive during the CoBrA period. ''White Bird'' (1948), ''Ladder'' (1949) and ''Scorched Earth I'' (1951) are some of his noted works from this period. At this time CoBrA published bulletin additional artists from several different disciplines joined their ranks. In 1948 Constant, together with poet [[Gerrit Kouwenaar]], published a poetry album ''Goede Morgen Haan''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Additionally there were two large CoBrA exhibitions, one in Amsterdam in 1949 and one in Liège in 1951.

The director of the [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam]] (Municipal Museum of Amsterdam), [[Willem Sandberg]], was very supportive of young artists and fully supported the CoBrA group by giving them seven large rooms to exhibit their work in. Most of the CoBrA works had been fairly small due to their lack of money and so Sandberg gave the artists an advance to create some larger works in the week before the exhibition. Constant, Corneille, Appel and [[Eugène Brands]] created several large pieces of art that have become iconic for the movement. The architect [[Aldo van Eyck]] was commissioned to shape the exhibition. The works of art as well as the way they were presented give rise to harsh critique from press and public. A critic from [[Het Vrije Volk]] wrote: "Geklad, geklets en geklodder in het Stedelijk Museum" ("Smirch, twaddle and mess in the Municipal Museum"). The CoBrA artists were considered scribblers and con artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultura.nl/page/tv-gids/776970 ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Liège exhibition in 1951, even larger than the Stedelijk exhibition, the CoBrA group dissolved itself and with its tenth edition bulletin publication. As Christian Dotremont, the international secretary, stated in Museum News in 1962 the group would rather "mourir en beauté" (die in beauty) than become a regular artist interest group.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;

==Situationist International==

After CoBrA Constant's work became more abstract. Back in Amsterdam in the summer of 1952 he developed an interest in spatial architecture and three-dimensional works. With Aldo van Eyck, whom he met during his CoBrA time, he created a space for the exhibition 'Man and House' at the Urban Museum Amsterdam from 1952-1953. In 1954 he worked on a project with [[Gerrit Rietveld]]. Together they created a model house for warehouses [[de Bijenkorf]].

In 1952 Constant received a scholarship from the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] to study in London for three months. There he met, amongst others, [[Henry Moore]], [[Anthony Hill (artist)|Anthony Hill]], [[Kenneth Martin]], [[Ben Nicholson]], [[Barbara Hepworth]], [[Roger Hilton]] and [[Victor Pasmore]]. He found the art climate in London very welcoming. As opposed to Paris, Constant felt that art was judged more objectively.

At that time Constant lived near [[Kensington Gardens]] and as he walked through the bombed city every day he started to wonder how people live and how cities should be built. His stay in London raised his awareness of how the constructions that surround us influence us. He felt that the constructions of his time were mostly practical, immensely dull and provided no room to develop playful and creative lifestyles.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"/&gt;

In the summer of 1956 [[Asger Jorn]] invited Constant to [[Alba, Piedmont]], Italy, for a congress dedicated to 'Industry and the Fine Arts' initiated by 'Mouvement pour un Bauhaus Imaginiste' ([[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]]). At this congress Constant presented his lecture ''Demain la poésie logera la vie'' in which he pleaded for a free architecture which could stimulate a creative lifestyle rather than impede it.In 1952 [[Guy Debord|Debord]] had founded the [[Lettrist International]]  for which he was a writer, filmmaker and strategic activist. The 'Lettrist International' were also at the Alba congress and they pleaded for a [[unitary urbanism]] (the synthesis of art and technology). Later that year Constant visited Debord in Alba, which proved to be an inspiration for both. 

Debord wanted to establish an even more radical movement which would totally abandon the arena of fine art while solely focusing on questions of [[psychogeography]], a total dissolution of boundaries between art and life. In 1957 he and Asger Jorn brought together the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus and the Lettrist International by establishing [[Situationist International]]. They specifically denied their status as an art movement.&lt;ref name="situacionistes1996"&gt;Libero Andreotti, Situacionistes, Situationists, [[Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona]], 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Constant did not join SI at that time. He objected to the SI on the ground that the movement seemed to be established mainly by artists who have their own interest at heart more than a common goal. When SI openly pleaded for '[[unitary urbanism]]', as defined by Constant and Debord, Constant joined. An intensive correspondence between him and Debord followed. Constant wrote several theoretical articles for the French SI journal and staged events at several museums in Paris as well as the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, where he showed his ''New Babylon'' series in 1959.

The success of the ''New Babylon'' show in 1959 prompted SI to plan a group exhibition there in April–May 1960. This exhibition would never take place. Disagreements in the group resulted in a split and several expulsions. In 1960 Constant left the group for the same reason he initially objected to joining. By 1961 no one remained of the original artistic core or tendency except Debord himself.&lt;ref name="situacionistes1996"/&gt; though members more allied to the SI's political tendency remained.

==New Babylon==
{{main|New Babylon (Constant Nieuwenhuys)}}
Back in Amsterdam after his stay in London, Nieuwenhuys started to focus mainly on architecture and the urban environment. The focal point of his work was finding out what potential added value art can provide in intensifying daily life, in which there is room for creative expression. He abandoned painting to work solely on his New Babylon project from 1956 to 1974.

With New Babylon Nieuwenhuys envisioned a "world wide city for the future" where land is owned collectively, work is fully automated and the need to work replaced with a nomadic life of creative play. New Babylon is inhabited by ''[[homo ludens]]'', who, freed from labor, will not have to make art, for he can be creative in the daily practice of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Drawing Papers 3, ''Another City for Another Life: Constant's New Babylon. An Homage to Constant'' by [[Catherine de Zegher]], [[The Drawing Center]], New York, 1999, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nieuwenhuys' own words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The project of New Babylon only intends to give the minimum conditions for a behaviour that must remain as free as possible. Any restriction of the freedom of movement, any limitation with regard to the creation of mood and atmosphere, has to be avoided. Everything has to remain possible, all is to happen, the environment has to be created by the activity of life, and not inversely.&lt;ref&gt;Constant, The Decomposition of the Artist: Five Texts by Constant, The Drawing Center, New York, 1999, a12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The New Babylon project consisted of a series of models, constructions, [[maquettes]], [[collages]], drawings, graphics and texts expressing Constant's theories of urban development and social interaction. A few examples of spatial constructions for which he used modern materials like stainless steel, aluminum and [[perspex]] are ''Het Ruimtecircus'' (1956) (Spatial Circus) and ''Het Zonneschip'' (1956) (Sunvessel).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"/&gt;

In 1974 the New Babylon project officially came to an end with a large exhibition in the [[Gemeentemuseum Den Haag]].&lt;ref name="renamed_from_1974_on_20140325014601"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notbored.org/new-babylon.html|title=New Babylon exhibition catalogue|last=Nieuwenhuis|first=Constant|publisher=NOT BORED!|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because he lacked room to store the vast collection of constructions, maquettes, maps and structures he sold them all to the museum. In 1999 ''Constant's New Babylon: City for Another Life'', opened at the [[Drawing Center]] in New York. It was his first solo exhibition in the United States and was curated by [[Mark Wigley]]. There was a symposium conducted in conjunction with the exhibition.

According to the Dutch architect [[Rem Koolhaas]], Nieuwenhuys has made a lot of architects think with his New Babylon: "He was an example of courage".

==Colorism==
Constant returned to painting, watercoloring and graphics in 1969. Until the mid-1970s, the subjects of his imaginary world New Babylon still crowded his work.&lt;ref name="Hummelink 1995"/&gt; However, more and more, he was inspired by contemporary and political issues, including such things as the Vietnam War, African famine and Kosovo refugees. Marxism was a strong influence. [[Rudi Fuchs]] said in his foreword to the Catalogue of Constant Paintings in 1995: "there are people who consider Constant's later work as a return to tradition. I, however, do not share this opinion. Because I consider his later development from the 1970s as greater penetration into the garden of painting."&lt;ref&gt;M. Hummelink, Constant. Paintings 1948-1995, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, 1995, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

In the tradition of the Venetian Renaissance painters, [[Titian]] and [[Tintoretto]], Constant applied himself to the technique of colorism. Following this technique the artist doesn't make use of charcoal or pencil sketches but applies colour directly on the canvas with the paintbrush, constructing soft transitions instead of sharp contours. The most important feature of this technique is the way light is expressed in the painting by integrating it into the colour. This technique is laborious. The painting comes to life layer by layer. Constant painted with oil on canvas and every layer he applied then needed to dry. In this period Constant produced a mere three to four paintings per year.&lt;ref&gt;Trudy van der Horst, Constant, De Late Periode, BnM uitgevers, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 Constant decorated a garden wall in Tibirkelunde, [[Sjelland]], Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stichtingconstant.nl/news/wall-tibirkelunde-denmark|title=The Wall in Tibirkelunde, Denmark|publisher=Stichting Constant|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 ''The Gate of Constant'' was placed at the entry of a sports park in the west side of Amsterdam. Constant designed the forty-foot-high concrete structure as a commission for the [[Municipality of Amsterdam]]. For almost three decades the structure adorned the entry in anonymity until Rita Doets, a former employee of the municipality, left money in her legacy to construct an information sign next to the gate.{{cn|date=August 2018}} Constant's widow, Trudy Nieuwenhuijs, was present at the inauguration.

In 1966 Constant designed a fountain for the Kooiplein in Leiden. For years the structure didn't function and slowly withered. When the square was redesigned in 1999, the fountain was repaired. New equipment made sure that the shoppers were not bothered by the water.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==Death==
Constant died on 1 August 2005 and was survived by his son and his three daughters, and by his widow and her daughter.

== Films ==
''Gyromorphosis (1958), 7 min'' - In Gyromorphosis, film maker [[Hy Hirsh]] strives to display the kinetic qualities of the New Babylon structures of Constant Nieuwenhuys. One by one he puts parts of the structures in motion and films the details with colored lighting having them overlap each other, appear and disappear. He creates a sensation of acceleration and suspense suggested by the work itself.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.em-arts.org/en/independent-films/gyromorphosis&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dairy salt''' is a [[salt]] product used in the preparation of [[butter]] and [[cheese]] products that serves to add flavor and act as a [[food preservative]].{{sfn|Bulletin|1895}}&lt;ref name="Pieters Flint Garriott Wickson 1899"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Block Rosing 2015"/&gt; Dairy salt can vary in terms of quality and purity, with purer varieties being the most desirable for use in foods. Dairy salt has been used since at least the 1890s in England and the United States. In butter preparation, it serves to retain moisture, while in cheeses, it tends to reduce water content and slow the ripening process.

==Purity==
Quality dairy salts have been described as having favorable solubility properties for use in butter and cheese, and the softness and form of the salt crystals is one of the determining factors of overall quality.&lt;ref name="Libby &amp; Sherwood 1890"/&gt; The purity of dairy salt is defined by the amount of sodium chloride present in the product, and those with at least 98% sodium chloride have been described as being of sound purity.&lt;ref name="Chicago Produce Company 1916"/&gt; Highly pure dairy salt has a pure white coloration, a uniformity in grain, and lacks any offensive odors or bitter flavor.&lt;ref name="Pieters Flint Garriott Wickson 1899"/&gt; Dairy salt products of lower purity may have a bitter flavor and poor solubility.{{sfn|Lenoir|Rogers|Ward|1924}} The use of impure dairy salt can have adverse effects upon butter, spoiling its flavor,&lt;ref name="Chicago Produce Company 1916"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saylor Publishing Company 1914"/&gt; grain, and preservation.&lt;ref name="Saylor Publishing Company 1914"/&gt; Impure dairy salt can make cheeses bitter, reducing their value. Impurities that may occur in dairy salt include calcium sulphate, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, and to a lesser extent, sodium sulphate and magnesium sulphate.&lt;ref name="Dearborn Trade Journal Co. 1923"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mitchell, Gere &amp; Company - Dealers in Coarse, Fine and Dairy Salt.jpg|thumb|235px|An 1819 newspaper advertisement for various salts, including dairy salt]]
[[File:Syracuse 1893 salt.jpg|thumb|An 1893 advertisement including content about The American Dairy Salt Co. Lt'd.]]

In the 1890s, many brands of dairy salt were available.&lt;ref name="Libby &amp; Sherwood 1890"/&gt; In England during this time, the Ashton and Higgins Eureka Salt brands were available (among others), and were used in the United States.&lt;ref name="Libby &amp; Sherwood 1890"/&gt; U.S. brands of dairy salt in the 1890s included [[Diamond Crystal|Diamond Crystal Salt]] and Genesee Salt, among others.&lt;ref name="Libby &amp; Sherwood 1890"/&gt; Almost all of these brands were very pure, being 98–99% sodium chloride.&lt;ref name="Libby &amp; Sherwood 1890"/&gt;

In 1899, it was estimated that around 82 million pounds of salt were used in the United States specifically for dairy purposes.&lt;ref name="Pieters Flint Garriott Wickson 1899"/&gt; At that time, this amount of salt was valued at US $800,000.&lt;ref name="Pieters Flint Garriott Wickson 1899"/&gt;

In 1914, it was written that American and Danish authorities were in agreement that large-sized, flat [[flake salt]] is the best type of dairy salt for use in butter products.&lt;ref name="Saylor Publishing Company 1914"/&gt; During this time, almost all dairy salt was prepared using the process of evaporation. Some techniques included leaving [[brine]] in the sun to evaporate, or heating it with fire underneath iron pans, with the salt crystals remaining after the liquid evaporated.&lt;ref name="Saylor Publishing Company 1914"/&gt; Additional methods included the Michigan grainer process and the vacuum pan process.&lt;ref name="Saylor Publishing Company 1914"/&gt; 

In the 1920s, calcium sulphate was one of the most common impurities in dairy salt.&lt;ref name="Wichmann 1917"/&gt; During this time, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s had a 1.4% maximum allowance for calcium sulphate in dairy salt and table salt.&lt;ref name="Wichmann 1917"/&gt;

==Uses==
===Butter===
Dairy salt serves to retain moisture and increase the weight of butter products, adds flavor&lt;ref name="Saylor Publishing Company 1914"/&gt; and serves as a preservative&lt;ref name="Chicago Produce Company 1916"/&gt; and antimicrobial, which can prevent bacterial contamination.&lt;ref name="Lück Laichena Jager 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Acton 2013"/&gt; Dairy salt used in butter preparation is sometimes referred to as butter salt&lt;ref name="Libby &amp; Sherwood 1890"/&gt; and buttersalt.&lt;ref name="International Dairy Federation"/&gt;

===Cheese===
Dairy salt has been used in the preparation of cheeses. Its use can add flavor to cheeses, and it tends to reduce the water content in cheeses, which can influence the [[Cheese ripening|ripening]] process.&lt;ref name="Pieters Flint Garriott Wickson 1899"/&gt; The use of impure dairy salt can make cheeses bitter in flavor, reducing their value.&lt;ref name="Pieters Flint Garriott Wickson 1899"/&gt; The use of too much salt in cheese can adversely affect its flavor, resulting in a product with a mealy and dry texture that is slow to ripen.&lt;ref name="Decker 1895"/&gt; 

Dairy salt is used in [[Cheddar cheese]],{{sfn|Bulletin|1895}} and serves to add flavor and reduce moisture.&lt;ref name="Decker 1895"/&gt; The reduction of moisture inhibits fermentation and slows the ripening process, which can produce a higher-quality cheese in terms of flavor and consistency.&lt;ref name="Decker 1895"/&gt;

'''Data drilling''' (also '''drilldown''') refers to any of various operations and transformations on tabular, relational, and multidimensional data. The term has widespread use in various contexts, but is primarily associated with specialized [[software]] designed specifically for [[data analysis]].

== Common data drilling operations ==
There are certain operations that are common to applications that allow data drilling. Among them are:

'''[[Information retrieval|Query]] operations''':
* tabular query
* pivot query

=== Tabular query ===
Tabular query operations consist of standard operations on data tables. 

Among these operations are:
* search
* sort
* filter (by value)
* filter (by extended function or condition)
* transform (e.g., by adding or removing columns)

Consider the following example:

'''Fred and Wilma table (Fig 001)''':

    gender  , fname    , lname        , home
    male    , fred     , chopin       , Poland
    male    , fred     , flintstone   , bedrock
    male    , fred     , durst        , usa
    female  , wilma    , flintstone   , bedrock
    female  , wilma    , rudolph      , usa
    female  , wilma    , webb         , usa
    male    , fred     , johnson      , usa

The preceding is an example of a simple flat file table formatted as comma-separated values. The table includes first name, last name, gender and home country for various people named fred or wilma. Although the example is formatted this way, it is important to emphasize that tabular query  operations (as well as all data drilling operations) can be applied to any conceivable [[data type]], regardless of the underlying formatting. The only requirement is that the data be readable by the software application in use.

=== Pivot query ===
A pivot query allows multiple representations of data according to different dimensions. This query type is similar to tabular query, except it also allows data to be represented in summary format, according to a flexible user-selected [[hierarchy]]. This class of data drilling operation is formally (and loosely) known by different names, including '''[[crosstab|crosstab query]]''', '''[[pivot table]]''', '''data pilot''', '''selective hierarchy''', '''[[intertwingularity]]''' and others.

To illustrate the basics of pivot query operations, consider the '''Fred and Wilma table (Fig 001)'''. A quick scan of the data reveals that the table has redundant information. This redundancy could be consolidated using an outline or a [[tree structure]] or in some other way. Moreover, once consolidated, the data could have many different alternate layouts. 

Using a simple text outline as output, the following alternate layouts are all possible with a pivot query:

'''Summarize by gender (Fig 001)''':
    female
        flintstone, wilma
        rudolph, wilma
        webb, wilma
    male
        chopin, fred
        flintstone, fred
        durst, fred
        johnson, fred
    
    (Dimensions = gender; Tabular fields = lname, fname;)

'''Summarize by home, lname (Fig 001)''':
    bedrock
        flintstone
            fred
            wilma
    Poland
        chopin
            fred
    usa
        ...
    
    (Dimensions = home, lname; Tabular fields = fname;)

==== Uses ====
Pivot query operations are useful for summarizing a corpus of data in multiple ways, thereby illustrating different representations of the same basic information. Although this type of operation appears prominently in [[spreadsheet]]s and desktop [[database]] software, its flexibility is arguably under-utilized. There are many applications that allow only a 'fixed' hierarchy for representing data, and this represents a substantial limitation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3084">'''Death spiral financing''' is a process in which [[convertible financing]] used to fund primarily [[small cap company|small cap companies]] can be used against it in the marketplace to cause the company’s [[stock]] to fall dramatically, which can lead to the company’s ultimate downfall. 

Many small companies rely on selling [[convertible debt]] to large private investors (see [[private investment in public equity]]) to fund their operations and growth. This convertible debt, often [[convertible preferred stock]] or [[convertible debenture]]s, can be converted to the [[common stock]] of the issuing company often at steep discounts to the [[market value]] of the common stock. Under the typical “death spiral” scenario, the holder of the convertible debt initially [[short (finance)|shorts]] the issuer’s common stock, which often causes the stock price to decline, at which time the debt holder converts some of the convertible debt to common shares with which he then [[cover (finance)|covers]] the debt holder's short position. The debt holder continues to sell short and cover with converted stock, which, along with selling by other shareholders alarmed by the falling price, continually weakens the share price, making the shares unattractive to new investors and possibly severely limiting the company’s ability to obtain new financing if necessary.

An important characteristic of this kind of convertible debt is that it often carries conditions like a quarterly or semiannual reset of the conversion price to keep the conversion price more or less close to the actual stock price. However, a lower conversion price also increases the number of shares that a bond holder gets in exchange for one bond, which increases the dilution of existing shareholders. A lower price reset can also force investors that have set up a long CB/short stock position to sell more stock ("adjust the delta"), creating a vicious circle, hence the nickname death spiral. 

Companies willing to agree to financing on these terms are often desperate and could not obtain funding through any other means.  The terms, though viewed by some as onerous, give the lender a potential way to recover their debt regardless of what happens to the shares of the company. The lender would have a potentially greater gain if the shares were to increase in value, but if they decrease in value, there is some protection.   Otherwise, they would probably not be willing to lend the money because of the poor risk profiles of the companies interested in this type of financing.

The '''Scottish Government Economy Directorates''' are a group of  [[UK civil service|civil service]] [[Ministry (government department)|Directorates]] in the [[Scottish Government]]. They were rebranded as the Economy Directorates in July 2016, having previously been reorganised in December 2010 and then in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/strategic-board/GovernanceandCommunities "Paul Gray, Director-General Rural Affairs, Environment and Services"]. Scottish Government. Retrieved 7 May 2011. This notice refers to the transfer of the DG of the Scottish Government Environment Directorates in December 2010, and thus indirectly to this re-organisation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The individual Directorates within the DG (Director-General) Economy family (the Economy Directorates) report to the Director-General, Liz Ditchburn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.gov.scot/About/People/strategic-board/EnterpriseandEnvironment |title=Director General Economy |publisher=Scottish Government |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ministers ==
There is no direct relationship between [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] and the Directorates. However, the activities of the Directorates include those under the purview of the [[Cabinet Secretary for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform]], [[Roseanna Cunningham]] MSP and the [[Cabinet Secretary for Rural Economy and Connectivity]]. The [[Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work]] also has responsibility for some of the work of these Directorates. They are supported in their work by the [[Minister for Transport and the Islands]] and the [[Minister for Business, Innovation and Energy]].

==Directorates==
The Directorates were previously the '''Enterprise, Environment and Innovation Directorates''', reorganised in July 2016.

The overarching Scottish Government Directorates were preceded by similar structures called "Departments" that no longer exist (although the word is still sometimes erroneously used in this context).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/08/23162100/1 "Reporting on 100 Days: Moving Scotland forward"] Scottish Government. Retrieved 15 August 2009. "A new structure for Scotland's Government has been put in place, transforming the Departmental structure, moving from nine Heads of Department, to a Strategic Board with the Permanent Secretary and six Directors-General (DGs), with each DG having responsibility for driving one of the Government's strategic objectives. Directors-General focus on the performance of the whole organisation against the Government's purpose. The new structure means that the old Scottish Executive Departments no longer exist. Instead, each DG supports and manages a number of Directorates headed by a Director with these Directorates leading, presenting and developing policy for Ministers."&lt;/ref&gt; As an overarching unit, the  Economy Directorates incorporate a number of individual Directorates entitled:

* Agriculture and Rural Economy Directorate
* Chief Economist Directorate
* Culture, Tourism and Major Events Directorate
* Economic Development Directorate
* Energy and Climate Change Directorate
* Environment and Forestry Directorate
* Fair Work, Employability and Skills Directorate
* [[Marine Scotland]] Directorate

==Agencies and other bodies==
The Directorates are responsible for one agency:
* [[Forestry Commission (Scotland)|Forestry Commission Scotland]]

The Directorates also sponsor several [[non-departmental public bodies]] including: 
* [[Cairngorms National Park|Cairngorms National Park Authority]]
* [[Crofters Commission]]
* [[Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park|Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park Authority]]
* [[James Hutton Institute]]
* [[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh]]
* [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]]
* [[Scottish Natural Heritage]]

The [[Rural Development Council (Scotland)|Rural Development Council]] was set up in 2008 to advise the Cabinet Secretary on rural affairs and to "consider how best rural Scotland can contribute to the creation of a more successful country, through increasing sustainable economic growth".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/farmingrural/Rural/rural-communities/RDC "Scotland Rural Development Council"]  Scottish Government. Retrieved 27 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to the creation of the Enterprise, Environment and Innovation Directorates in June 2014, the group was known as the Enterprise, Environment and Digital Directorates from December 2010.  Prior to 2007, the work had been carried out by the old [[Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department]] (SEERAD).

The '''Court of Auditors''' ('''European Court of Auditors''', '''ECA''') (French: ''Cour des comptes européenne'') is the [[Institutions of the European Union|fifth institution]] of the [[European Union]] (EU). It was established in 1975 in [[Luxembourg City|Luxembourg]].

==History==
{{Politics of the European Union}}
{{Main|History of the European Union}}
The Court of Auditors was created by the [[Treaties of the European Union#Budgetary treaties|1975 Budgetary Treaty]] and was formally established on 18 October 1977, holding its first session a week later. At that time the Court was not a formal institution; it was an external body designed to audit the finances of the [[European Communities]]. It replaced two separate audit bodies, one which dealt with the finances of the [[European Economic Community]] and [[Euratom]], and one which dealt with the [[European Coal and Steel Community]].&lt;ref name="ENA ECA"&gt;{{cite web|title=European Court of Auditors|publisher=[[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]]|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/european_court_of_auditors-en-03726b57-8e08-4c93-af15-bf8721590763.html|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court did not have a defined legal status until the [[Treaty of Maastricht]] when it was made the fifth institution, the first new institution since the founding of the Community. By becoming an institution it gained some new powers, such as the ability to bring actions before the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ). At first its audit power related only to the [[European Community]] [[Three pillars of the European Union|pillar]] of the [[European Union]] (EU), but under the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] it gained the full power to audit the finances of the whole of the EU.&lt;ref name="ENA ECA"/&gt;

==Functions==
Despite its name, the Court has no judicial functions. It is rather a professional external investigatory audit agency.&lt;ref name="BH Sp"/&gt; The primary role of the court is to externally check if the [[budget of the European Union]] has been implemented correctly, in that EU funds have been spent legally and with sound management. In doing so, the court checks the paperwork of all persons handling any income or expenditure of the Union and carries out spot checks. The court is bound to report any problems in the Court's reports for the attention of other states and institutions, these reports include its general annual report as well as specific and special reports on certain bodies and issues.&lt;ref name="Europa Institutions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Institutions of the EU: The European Court of Auditors|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/auditors/index_en.htm|accessdate=15 October 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222001147/http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/auditors/index_en.htm|archivedate=22 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power of audit of the European Court of Auditors|publisher=[[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]]|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/power_of_audit_of_the_european_court_of_auditors-en-f42b856f-6c9b-4434-8254-69e87a0efa62.html|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court's decision is the basis for the [[European Commission]] decisions; for example, when the Court found problems in the management of EU funds in the [[regions of England]], the Commission suspended funds to those regions and prepared to fine those who did not come back up to acceptable standards.&lt;ref name="BBC Eng"&gt;{{cite web|title=EU may force region to repay cash|date=16 October 2007|publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/file_on_4/7045159.stm|accessdate=17 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this role, the Court has to remain independent yet remain in touch with the other institutions; for example, a key role is the presentation of the Court's annual report to the [[European Parliament]]. It is based on this report that the Parliament makes its decision on whether or not to sign off the European Commission's handling of the budget for that year.&lt;ref name="Europa Institutions"/&gt; The Parliament notably refused to do this in 1984 and 1999, the latter case forced the [[Santer Commission#Budget controversy|resignation of the Santer Commission]].&lt;ref name="background"&gt;{{cite web | title=Budgetary control: 1996 discharge raises issue of confidence in the Commission | publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]| year=1999 | url =http://www.europarl.europa.eu/election/bilan/en/pf1901en.htm | accessdate = 15 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court, if satisfied, also sends assurances to the Council and Parliament that the taxpayers' money is being properly used,&lt;ref name="Europa Institutions"/&gt; and the Court must be consulted before the adoption of any legislation with financial implications, but its opinion is never binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consultative powers of the European Court of Auditors|publisher=CVCE|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/consultative_powers_of_the_european_court_of_auditors-en-5f52454a-7e43-42e3-a9ba-8b7663077de7.html|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
[[File:Europäischer Rechnungshof.jpg|thumb|The ECA's premises in [[Luxembourg City]]]]

The Court is composed of one member from each EU state, each of whom is—after a hearing in the [[Committee on Budgetary Control|Budgetary Control Committee]] and a non-binding majority-vote in the committee as well as in the plenary of the European Parliament—appointed unanimously by the [[Council of the European Union]] for a renewable term of six years.&lt;ref name="Europa Institutions"/&gt; They are not all replaced every six years, however, as their terms do not coincide (four of the original members began with reduced terms of four years for this reason). Members are chosen from people who have served in national audit bodies, who are qualified for the office and whose independence is beyond doubt. While serving in the Court, members cannot engage in any other professional activities.&lt;ref name="ENA Comp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Composition of the European Court of Auditors|publisher=CVCE|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/composition_of_the_european_court_of_auditors-en-0bf8b1ef-450f-4b68-a465-d441bd7fabe6.html|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the body is independent, its members are free to decide their own organisation and rules of procedure, although these must be ratified by the Council of the European Union.&lt;ref name="ENA OO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Organisation and operation of the European Court of Auditors|publisher=CVCE|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/organisation_and_operation_of_the_european_court_of_auditors-en-3a686eb2-9c66-45d4-a0fe-4ef23fe21f2f.html|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Treaty of Nice, the Court can set up "chambers" (with only a few Members each) to adopt certain types of reports or opinions.&lt;ref name="Europa Glossary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary: The European Court of Auditors|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/european_court_auditors_en.htm|accessdate=15 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court is supported by a staff of approximately 800 auditors, [[translation|translator]]s and administrators [[EU Concours|recruited]] as part of the [[European Civil Service]]. Auditors are divided into auditor groups which inspect and prepare draft reports for the Court to take decisions upon. Inspections take place not only of EU institutions but of any state which receives EU funds, given that 90% of [[income]] and [[expenditure]] is managed by national authorities rather than the EU. Upon finding a fault, the Court—possessing no legal powers of its own—informs the [[European Anti-fraud Office]] (''OLAF''), which is the EU's anti-fraud agency.&lt;ref name="Europa Institutions"/&gt; The Court is also assisted by the [[Secretary-General of the European Court of Auditors]], elected by the Court, who—along with general management and assistance to the President—draws up draft minutes and keeps archives of decisions, as well as ensuring the publication of reports in the ''[[Official Journal of the European Union]]''.&lt;ref name="ENA ORG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Organisation of the European Court of Auditors|publisher=CVCE|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/organisation_of_the_european_court_of_auditors-en-97ed4e20-799e-48e7-8650-97377bd3f494.html|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===President===
The members then elect one of their number as the President of the Court for a renewable three-year term. The election takes place by a secret ballot of those members who applied for the presidency. The duties of the President (which may be delegated) are to convene and chair the meetings of the Court, ensuring that decisions are implemented and the departments (and other activities) are soundly managed. The president also represents the court and appoints a representative for it in contentious proceedings.&lt;ref name="ENA ORG"/&gt;

The current President is Klaus-Heiner Lehne, elected on 13 September 2016. He succeeded Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira (of [[Portugal]]), elected in 2007.&lt;ref name="Europa Institutions"/&gt; Previous presidents have been Sir Norman Price (1977, [[United Kingdom]]), Michael Murphy (1977, [[Ireland]]), Pierre Lelong (1981, [[France]]), Marcel Mart (1984, [[Luxembourg]]), Aldo Angioi (1990, [[Italy]]), André Middelhoek (1992, [[Netherlands]]), Bernhard Friedmann (1996, [[Germany]]), [[Jan O. Karlsson]] (1999, [[Sweden]]), Juan Manuel Fabra Vallés † (2002, [[Spain]]) and [[Hubert Weber]] (2006, [[Austria]]).&lt;ref name="ENA Pres"&gt;{{cite web|title=Presidents of the European Court of Auditors|publisher=CVCE|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/presidents_of_the_court_of_auditors-en-375395a7-768b-462d-8e6f-b52f8f64128c.html|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secretary-general ===
The [[Secretary-General]] is the European Court of Auditors most senior member of staff. Appointed for a renewable term of 6 years, he is responsible for the management of the Court's staff and for the administration of the Court. In addition, the Secretary-General is responsible for the budget, translation, training and information technology.

==Criticism==

===Declaration of Assurance===
Since 1994 the Court has been required to provide a "Declaration of Assurance", essentially a certificate that an entire annual budget can be accounted for. This has proved to be a problem, as even relatively minor omissions require the Court to refuse a declaration of assurance for the entire budget, even if almost all of the budget is considered reliable.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

This has led to media reports of the EU accounts being "riddled with [[fraud]]", where issues are based on errors in paperwork even though the underlying spending was legal.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The auditing system itself has drawn criticism from this perception. The Commission in particular has stated that the bar is too high, and that only 0.09% of the budget is subject to fraud.&lt;ref name="BBC 2006"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mulvey|first=Stephen|title=Why the EU's audit is bad news|publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6078982.stm|accessdate=15 October 2007 | date=24 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission has elsewhere stated that it is important to distinguish between fraud and other irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/anti_fraud/reports/commission/2009/en.pdf |title=Protection of the European Union's financial interests – Fight against fraud – Annual Report 2009 (''vid.'' p. 5) |publisher=Europa |accessdate=22 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729063014/http://ec.europa.eu/anti_fraud/reports/commission/2009/en.pdf |archivedate=29 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversial dismissal in 2003 of [[Marta Andreasen]] for her criticism of procedures in 2002 has, for some, called into doubt the integrity of the institutions.

It is frequently claimed that annual accounts have not been certified by the external auditor since 1994. In its annual report on the implementation of the 2009 EU Budget, the Court of Auditors found that the two biggest areas of the EU budget, agriculture and regional spending, have not been signed off on and remain "materially affected by error".&lt;ref name="EU spending not signed off for 16th year running"&gt;{{cite web|title=OpenEurope |publisher=OpenEurope |url=http://www.openeurope.org.uk/media-centre/pressrelease.aspx?pressreleaseid=150|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Wynn]], an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] who served on the Parliament's [[Committee on Budgetary Control]] and reached the position of chairman, has also backed these calls, stating that it is impossible for the Commission to achieve these standards. In a report entitled ''EU Budget – Public Perception &amp; Fact – how much does it cost, where does the money go and why is it criticised so much?'', Wynn cites [[consensus]] that practice in the EU differs from that in the USA. In the USA, the focus is on the financial information, not on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, 'So, other than in Europe, the political reaction in the US to the failure to obtain a clean audit opinion is only "a big yawn"'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terrywynn.com/Budget/EU%20Budget%20-%20Perception%20&amp;%20Fact.htm |title=EU Budget – Public Perception &amp; Fact (''vid.'' II.1.2; Conclusion)|publisher=Terry Wynn |accessdate=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By comparison, the [[Comptroller and Auditor General (United Kingdom)|Comptroller and Auditor General]] for the United Kingdom stated that there were 500 separate accounts for the UK, and "in the last year, I qualified 13 of the 500. If I had to operate the EU system, then, because I qualify 13 accounts, I might have to qualify the whole [[Her Majesty's Government|British central government]] expenditure". Despite the problems, the [[Barroso Commission]] stated that it aimed to bring the budget within the Court's limits by the end of its mandate in 2009.&lt;ref name="BBC 2006"/&gt;

The ECA made clear in its year report for 2010 that "Responsibility for the legality and regularity of spending on Cohesion Policies starts in the Member States, but the Commission bears the ultimate responsibility for the correct implementation of the budget". In previous reports, the ECA has noted that "Regardless of the method of implementation applied, the Commission bears the ultimate responsibility for the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts of the European Communities (Article 274 of the Treaty)".&lt;ref name="EU spending not signed off for 16th year running"/&gt;

===Size===
The size of the court has also come under criticism. Owing to the one-member-per-state system, its members grew from nine to twenty-seven as of 2007. Attempting to get consensus in the body has thus become more difficult; this led to the number of its special reports per year shrinking from fifteen to six between 2003 and 2005, despite its staff growing by 200 over the same period. Some proposals have been for its size to be reduced to five members or just one, possibly with an advisory board with members from each member state. However, neither the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] nor the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] proposed any changes to its composition, despite calls by former court members and MEPs to embrace change.&lt;ref name="BH Sp"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bösch|first=Herbert|authorlink=Herbert Bösch|title= Speech by Herbert Bösch, Chairman of the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=18 October 2007|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=ECA/07/21&amp;format=PDF&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en|accessdate=17 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EV 07"&gt;{{cite web|last=Karlsson|first=Jan|author2=Tobisson, Lars|title= ‘Much talk, little action’ at European Court of Auditors|publisher=[[European Voice]]|url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/archive/article.asp?id=28233|accessdate=15 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court offer approximately 50 traineeships a year, successful applicants come mainly from financial, economic, accounting and legal backgrounds. The ECA traineeship program receives thousands of applications across Europe every year for the February and May intakes, with an extremely competitive selection process.

Some economists reject that full employment and see [[inflation]] as being a likely consequence of its enforcement, i.e. to prevent inflation from accelerating. This view is based on a theory centered on the concept of the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment ([[NAIRU]]), and those who hold it usually mean [[NAIRU]] when speaking of full employment.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} The NAIRU has also been described by [[Milton Friedman]], among others, as the "natural" rate of unemployment. Having many names, it has also been called the structural unemployment rate.

For the United States, economist [[William T. Dickens]] found that full-employment unemployment rate varied a lot over time but equaled about 5.5 percent of the civilian labor force during the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2009/7/unemployment%20dickens/07_unemployment_dickens.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416005807/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2009/7/unemployment%20dickens/07_unemployment_dickens.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, economists have emphasized the idea that full employment represents a "range" of possible unemployment rates. For example, in 1999, in the United States, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) gives an estimate of the "full-employment unemployment rate" of 4 to 6.4%.  This is the estimated unemployment rate at full employment, plus &amp; minus the [[standard error]] of the estimate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/44/50/2086120.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of full employment of labor corresponds to the concept of [[potential output]] or potential real GDP and the long run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve. In [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] macroeconomics, the highest sustainable level of aggregate real GDP or "potential" is seen as corresponding to a vertical LRAS curve: any increase in the demand for real GDP can only lead to rising prices in the long run, while any increase in output is temporary.

== Economic concept ==
What most [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economists]] mean by "full" employment is a rate somewhat less than 100% employment. Others, such as the late [[James Tobin]], have been accused of disagreeing, considering full employment as 0% unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;"As a young professor I did a paper where I analyzed the optimal unemployment rate," said [[Joseph Stiglitz]], a professor at [[Columbia University]] in New York, who knew Tobin at [[Yale university|Yale]]. "Tobin went livid over the idea. To him the optimal unemployment rate was zero."
[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=ajz1hV_afuSQ Yale's Tobin Guides Obama From Grave as Friedman Is Eclipsed]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was not Tobin's perspective in his later work.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, "Inflation and Unemployment" by James Tobin, ''The American Economic Review'', Vol. 62, No. 1/2 (Mar. 1, 1972), pp. 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some see [[John Maynard Keynes]] as attacking the existence of rates of unemployment substantially above 0%:
:"The Conservative belief that there is some law of nature which prevents men from being employed, that it is 'rash' to employ men, and that it is financially 'sound' to maintain a tenth of the population in idleness for an indefinite period, is crazily improbable - the sort of thing which no man could believe who had not had his head fuddled with nonsense for years and years. The objections which are raised are mostly not the objections of experience or of practical men. They are based on highly abstract theories – venerable, academic inventions, half misunderstood by those who are applying them today, and based on assumptions which are contrary to the facts… Our main task, therefore, will be to confirm the reader's instinct that what seems sensible is sensible, and what seems nonsense is nonsense." – J. M. Keynes in a pamphlet to support [[Lloyd George]] in the 1929 election.

Most readers would interpret this statement as referring to only cyclical, [[cyclical unemployment|deficient-demand]], or "involuntary" unemployment (discussed below) but not to unemployment existing as "full employment" (mismatch and frictional unemployment). This is because, writing in 1929, Keynes was discussing a period in which the unemployment rate had been persistently above most conceptions of what corresponds to full employment. That is, a situation where a tenth of the population (and thus a larger percentage of the [[labor force]]) is unemployed involves a disaster.

One major difference between Keynes and the [[Classical economics|Classical economists]] was that while the latter saw "full employment" as the normal state of affairs with a free-market economy (except for short periods of adjustment), Keynes saw the possibility of persistent aggregate-demand failure causing unemployment rates to exceed those corresponding to full employment. Put differently, while Classical economists saw all unemployment as "voluntary", Keynes saw the possibility that [[involuntary unemployment]] can exist when the demand for final products is low compared to potential output.
This can be seen in his later and more serious work. In his ''General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money'', chapter 2, he used a definition that should be familiar to modern macroeconomics:
:This state of affairs we shall describe as "full" employment, both "frictional" and "voluntary" unemployment being consistent with "full" employment thus defined.&lt;ref name="johnmaynardkeynes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/ |title=The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money |author=John Maynard Keynes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The only difference from the usual definitions is that, as discussed below, most economists would add skill/location mismatch or [[structural unemployment]] as existing at full employment. More theoretically, Keynes had two main definitions of full employment, which he saw as equivalent. His first main definition of full employment involves the absence of "involuntary" unemployment:

: the equality of the real wage to the marginal disutility of employment ... realistically interpreted, corresponds to the absence of "involuntary" unemployment.&lt;ref name="johnmaynardkeynes"/&gt;

Put another way, the full employment and the absence of involuntary unemployment correspond to the case where the real wage equals the marginal cost to workers of supplying labor for hire on the market (the "marginal disutility of employment"). That is, the real wage rate and the amount of employment correspond to a point on the aggregate supply curve of labor that is assumed to exist. In contrast, a situation with less than full employment and thus involuntary unemployment would have the real wage above the supply price of labor. That is, the employment situation corresponds to a point above and to the left of the aggregate supply curve of labor: the real wage would be above the point on the aggregate supply curve of labor at the current level of employment; alternatively, the level of employment would be below the point on that supply curve at the current real wage.

Second, in chapter 3, Keynes saw full employment as a situation where "a further increase in the value of the effective demand will no longer be accompanied by any increase in output."
: In the previous chapter we have given a definition of full employment in terms of the behavior of labor. An alternative, though equivalent, criterion is that at which we have now arrived, namely a situation, in which aggregate employment is inelastic in response to an increase in the effective demand for its output.&lt;ref name="johnmaynardkeynes"/&gt;

This means that at and above full employment, any increase in aggregate demand and employment corresponds primarily to increases in prices rather than output. Thus, full employment of labor corresponds to potential output.

Whilst full employment is often an aim for an economy, most economists see it as more beneficial to have some level of unemployment, especially of the frictional sort. In theory, this keeps the labor market flexible, allowing room for new innovations and investment. As in the NAIRU theory, the existence of some unemployment is required to avoid accelerating inflation.

==Historical measurement and discussion==
For the United Kingdom, the OECD estimated the NAIRU (or structural unemployment) rate as being equal to 8.5% on average between 1988 and 1997, 5.9% between 1998 and 2007, 6.2%, 6.6%, and 6.7 in 2008, 2009, and 2010, then staying at 6.9% in 2011-2013. For the United States, they estimate it as being 5.8% on average between 1988 and 1997, 5.5% between 1998 and 2007, 5.8% in 2008, 6.0% in 2009, and then staying at 6.1% from 2010 to 2013. They also estimate the NAIRU for other countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/eco/outlook/economicoutlookannextables.htm table 22. These estimates are done using the commonly-used definition of unemployment rather than using the measures based on efforts to standardize the measure of unemployment across countries.&lt;/ref&gt; These calculations have been criticised as lacking any foundation in evidence.&lt;ref&gt;E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3044448 SSRN, part 2(1)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The era after the 2007-2009 [[Great Recession]] shows the relevance of this concept, for example as seen in the United States. On the one hand, in 2013 [[Keynesian]] economists such as [[Paul Krugman]] of [[Princeton University]] see unemployment rates as too high relative to full employment and the NAIRU and thus favor increasing the aggregate demand for goods and services and thus labor in order to reduce unemployment. On the other hand, pointing to shortages of some skilled workers, some businesspeople and [[Classical economists]] suggest that the U.S. economy is already at full employment, so that any demand stimulus will lead to nothing but rising inflation rates. One example was [[Narayana Kocherlakota]], President of the Minneapolis [[Federal Reserve Bank]], who has since changed his mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-10-09/business/sns-rt-us-usa-fed-kocherlakotabre8980kq-20121009_1_narayana-kocherlakota-inflation-hawk-benchmark-rate|title=How a Fed inflation hawk changed his mind|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative, more normative, definition (used by some labor economists) would see "full employment" as the attainment of the ''ideal'' unemployment rate, where the types of unemployment that reflect labor-market inefficiency (such as mismatch or [[unemployment types#Structural unemployment|structural unemployment]]) do not exist. That is, only some ''frictional'' or voluntary unemployment would exist, where workers are temporarily searching for new jobs and are thus voluntarily unemployed. This type of unemployment involves workers "shopping" for the best jobs at the same time that employers "shop" for the best possible employees to serve their needs. Its existence can allow the best possible correspondence between workers and jobs from the points of view of both employees and employers and thus promotes the economy's [[efficiency]].

=== Unemployment at Beveridge Full Employment ===
[[William Beveridge]] defined "full employment" as where the number of unemployed workers equaled the number of job vacancies available (while preferring that the economy be kept above that full employment level in order to allow maximum economic production). But the point is that this definition allows for ''some'' unemployment. To see this, assume that frictional and mismatch unemployment can be separated. At Beveridge full employment, in the case of ''frictional'' unemployment the number of job-seekers corresponds to an equal number of job openings: as discussed above, the unemployed are "shopping" for the best possible jobs (as long as the cost of job-search is less than the expected benefit) at the same time that employers are "shopping" for the best possible employees to fill the vacancies. Similarly,at Beveridge full employment, the number of people suffering from mismatch or [[unemployment types#Structural unemployment|structural unemployment]] equals the number of vacancies. The problem here is that the skills and geographical locations of the unemployed workers does not correspond to the skill requirements and locations of the vacancies. In theory, Beveridge's concept full employment corresponds to that of Keynes (discussed above).

The situation with less than full employment in Beveridge's sense results either from [[unemployment types#Classical unemployment|"Classical" unemployment]] or "neoclassical" unemployment or from Keynesian deficient-demand unemployment. In terms of supply and demand, Classical or neoclassical unemployment results from the actual real wage exceeding the equilibrium real wage, so that the quantity of labor demanded (and the number of vacancies) is less than the quantity of labor supplied (and the number of unemployed workers). In the ''Classical'' theory, the problem is that real wages are rigid, i.e., do not fall due to an excess supply of labor. In theory, this might happen because of minimum wage laws and other interference with "free markets" that prevent the attainment of market perfection. Classical economists favor making labor markets more like the ideal competitive market—and so making real wages more flexible—in order to deal with this kind of unemployment.

The neoclassical theory, in contrast, follows [[John Maynard Keynes]] and more importantly, [[Milton Friedman]] to blame inflexible ''money'' or ''nominal'' wages for low employment relative to full employment. If the money wage is fixed, the real wage is fixed for any given average price level, so that rigid money wages have the same effect as rigid real wages when the price level is given. In this case, however, real wages can be depressed (and Beveridge full employment restored) if prices rise relative to nominal wages. Alternatively, people could wait for the persistence of high unemployment to eventually cause money wages to fall. This would have the same effect, reducing real wages and increasing the quantity of labor demanded. One of the big debates in macroeconomics is whether it is better to deal with neoclassical unemployment using a small amount of inflation or by waiting for markets to adjust.

In contrast, Keynesian deficient-demand unemployment (as explained by [[Don Patinkin]]) sees a situation with less than full employment (following Beveridge's definition) as possibly prevailing ''even if'' the actual real wage is equal to the equilibrium real wage at full employment. The problem is that the demand for final products is limited by [[aggregate demand]] failure. Low demand for products (below potential output) implies that there is a sales constraint on the labor market to the left of equilibrium so that the quantity of labor demanded is below the amount that would be demanded if the aggregate demand for products was sufficient (what [[Robert Clower]] called the ''notional'' demand for labor). In terms of neoclassical theory, the prevailing real wage is less than the marginal physical product of labor in this situation. In the absence of the sales constraint, profit-maximizing employers would hire unemployed workers as long as this inequality is true, moving the labor markets toward full employment. However, the sales constraint means that the extra product of these workers ''could not be sold''. Thus, employers would not hire the unemployed until aggregate demand rose, which would shift the sales constraint to the right, allowing more employment of labor. In this situation, Keynesians recommend policies that raise the aggregate demand for final products and thus the aggregate demand for workers.

The economic literature concerning the [[Phillips Curve]] and the [[NAIRU]] moved away from the direct examination of labor market to focus instead on the behavior of inflation rates at different unemployment rates. That is, while Beveridge and Keynes saw full-employment unemployment as where the supply of and the demand for labor were in balance, later views saw it as a threshold which should not be crossed, since low unemployment causes serious inflation.

=== The Phillips curves ===
The theories behind the [[Phillips curve]] pointed to the inflationary costs of lowering the unemployment rate. That is, as unemployment rates fell and the economy approached full employment, the [[inflation]] rate would rise.  But this theory also says that there is no single unemployment number that one can point to as the "full employment" rate. Instead, there is a [[trade-off]] between unemployment and inflation: a government might choose to attain a lower unemployment rate but would pay for it with higher inflation rates. In essence, in this view, the meaning of “full employment” is really nothing but a matter of opinion based on how the benefits of lowering the unemployment rate compare to the costs of raising the inflation rate.

Though their theory had been proposed by the Keynesian economist [[Abba Lerner]] several years before {{Harv|Lerner|1951|loc=Chapter 15}}, it was the work of [[Milton Friedman]], leader of the [[monetarist]] school of economics, and [[Edmund Phelps]] that ended the popularity of this concept of full employment. In 1968, Friedman posited the theory that full employment rate of unemployment was ‘’’unique’’’ at any given time. He called it the "natural" rate of unemployment. Instead of being a matter of opinion and normative judgment, it is something we are stuck with, even if it is unknown. As discussed further, below, inflation/unemployment trade-offs cannot be relied upon.  Further, rather than trying to attain full employment, Friedman argues that policy-makers should try to keep prices stable (meaning a low or even a zero inflation rate). If this policy is sustained, he suggests that a free-market economy will gravitate to the "natural" rate of unemployment automatically.

=== The NAIRU ===
{{main|NAIRU}}

[[Image:NAIRU-SR-and-LR.svg|thumb|right|200px|[[Phillips Curve]] before and after Expansionary Policy, with Long-Run Phillips Curve ([[NAIRU]])]]

In an effort to avoid the normative connotations of the word "natural," James Tobin (following the lead of Franco Modigliani), introduced the term the “'''N'''on-'''A'''ccelerating '''I'''nflation '''R'''ate of '''U'''nemployment” (NAIRU), which corresponds to the situation where the real gross domestic product equals potential output. It has been called the  "inflation threshold" unemployment rate or the inflation barrier.  This concept is identical to [[Milton Friedman]]’s concept of the "natural" rate but reflects the fact that there is nothing "natural" about an economy. The level of the NAIRU depends on the degree of "supply side" unemployment, i.e., joblessness that can't be abolished by high demand. This includes frictional,  mismatch, and Classical unemployment. When the actual unemployment rate equals the NAIRU, there is no cyclical or deficient-demand unemployment. That is, Keynes’ involuntary unemployment does not exist.

To understand this concept, start with the actual unemployment equal to the NAIRU. Then, assume that a country’s government and its [[central bank]] use demand-side policy to reduce the unemployment rate and then attempt to keep the rate at a specific low level: rising budget deficits or falling interest rates increase aggregate demand and raise employment of labor. Thus, the actual unemployment rate falls, as going from point '''A''' to  '''B''' in the nearby graph. Unemployment then stays below the NAIRU for years or more, as at point '''B'''. In this situation, the theory behind the NAIRU posits that inflation will accelerate, i.e. get worse and worse (in the absence of wage and price controls). As the short-run [[Phillips curve]] theory indicates, higher inflation rate results from low unemployment. That is, in terms of the "trade-off" theory, low unemployment can be "bought," paid for by suffering from higher inflation. But the NAIRU theory says that this is not the whole story, so that the trade-off breaks down: a persistently higher inflation rate is eventually incorporated as higher ''inflationary expectations''. Then, if workers and employers expect higher inflation, it results in higher inflation, as higher money wages are passed on to consumers as higher prices. This causes the short run Phillips curve to shift to the right and upward, worsening the [[trade-off]] between inflation and unemployment. At a given unemployment rate, inflation accelerates. But if the unemployment rate rises to equal the NAIRU, we see higher inflation than before the expansionary policies, as at point '''C''' in the nearby diagram. The fall of the unemployment rate was temporary because it could not be sustained. In sum, the trade-off between inflation and unemployment cannot be relied upon to be stable: taking advantage of it causes it to disappear. This story fits the experience of the United States during the late 1960s, during which unemployment rates stayed low (below 4% of the civilian labor force) and inflation rates rose significantly.

Second, examine the other main case. Again start with the unemployment rate equal to the NAIRU. Then, either shrinking government budget deficits (or rising government surpluses) or rising real interest rates encourage higher unemployment. In this situation, the NAIRU theory says that inflation will get better (decelerate) if unemployment rates exceed the NAIRU for a long time.  High unemployment leads to lower inflation, which in turn causes lower inflationary expectations and a further round of lower inflation. High unemployment causes the short-run inflation/unemployment trade-off to improve. This story fits the experience of the United States during the early 1980s ([[Paul Volcker]]'s war against inflation), during which unemployment rates stayed high (at about 10% of the civilian labor force) and inflation rates fell significantly.

Finally, the NAIRU theory says that the inflation rate does not rise or fall when the unemployment equals the "natural" rate. This is where the term NAIRU is derived. In macroeconomics, the case where the actual unemployment rate equals the NAIRU is seen as the long-run [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] because there are no forces inside the normal workings of the economy that cause the inflation rate to rise or fall. The NAIRU corresponds to the ''long-run Phillips curve''. While the short-run Phillips curve is based on a constant rate of inflationary expectations, the long-run Phillips curve reflects full adjustment of inflationary expectations to the actual experience of inflation in the economy.

As mentioned above, [[Abba Lerner]] had developed a version of the NAIRU before the modern "natural" rate or NAIRU theories were developed. Unlike the currently dominant view, Lerner saw a range of "full employment" unemployment rates. Crucially, the unemployment rate depended on the economy's institution. Lerner distinguished between "high" full employment, which was the lowest sustainable unemployment under [[incomes policies]], and "low" full employment, i.e., the lowest sustainable unemployment rate without these policies.

Further, it is possible that the value of the NAIRU depends on government policy, rather than being "natural" and unvarying. A government can attempt to make people "employable" by both positive means (e.g. using training courses) and negative means (e.g. cuts in unemployment insurance benefits).  These policies do not necessarily create full employment. Instead, the point is to reduces the amount of mismatch unemployment by facilitating the linking of unemployed workers with the available jobs by training them and or subsidizing their moving to the geographic location of the jobs.

In addition, the [[hysteresis (economics)|hysteresis hypothesis]] says that the NAIRU does not stay the same over time—and can change due to economic policy.&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves Heap, Shawn P. (1980). Choosing the Wrong “Natural” Rate: Accelerating Inflation or Decelerating Employment and Growth? ''Economic Journal''. vol. 90 (September): 611-620.&lt;/ref&gt; A persistently low unemployment rate makes it easier for those workers who are unemployed for "mismatch" reasons to move to where the jobs are and/or to attain the training necessary for the available vacancies (often by getting those jobs and receiving on-the-job training). On the other hand, high unemployment makes it more difficult for those workers to adjust, while hurting their morale, job-seeking skills, and the value of their work skills. Thus, some economists argue that British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s anti-inflation policies using persistently high unemployment led to higher mismatch or structural unemployment and a higher NAIRU.

=== Uncertainty ===

Whatever the definition of full employment, it is difficult to discover exactly what unemployment rate it corresponds to. In the United States, for example, the economy saw stable inflation ''despite'' low unemployment during the late 1990s, contradicting most economists' estimates of the NAIRU.

The idea that the full-employment unemployment rate (NAIRU) is not a unique number has been seen in recent empirical research. Staiger, Stock, and Watson found that the range of possible values of the NAIRU (from 4.3 to 7.3% unemployment) was too large to be useful to macroeconomic policy-makers. [[Robert Eisner]] suggested that for 1956-95 there was a zone from about 5% to about 10% unemployment between the low-unemployment realm of accelerating inflation and the high-unemployment realm of [[disinflation]]. In between, he found that inflation falls with falling unemployment.

== Policy ==
The active pursuit of national full [[employment]] through interventionist government policies is associated with [[Keynesian economics]] and marked the postwar agenda of many Western nations, until the [[stagflation]] of the 1970s.

=== Australia ===
[[Australia]] was the first country in the world in which full employment in a capitalist society was made official policy by its [[government]]. On May 30, 1945, The [[Australian Labor Party]] [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Curtin]] and his Employment Minister [[John Dedman]] proposed a [[white paper]] in the [[Australian House of Representatives]] titled [[White Paper on Full Employment|''Full Employment In Australia'']], the first time any government apart from [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes had unequivocally committed itself to providing work for any person who was willing and able to work. Conditions of full employment lasted in Australia from 1941 to 1975. This had been preceded by the [[Harvester Judgment]] (1907), establishing the [[basic wage]] (a [[living wage]]); while this earlier case was overturned, it remained influential.

=== United States ===
The United States is, as a statutory matter, committed to full employment; the government is empowered to effect this goal.&lt;ref&gt;"A bill to establish and translate into practical reality the right of all adult Americans able, willing, and seeking to work to full opportunity for useful paid employment at fair rates of compensation;" [[Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act]] (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; The relevant legislation is the [[Employment Act]] (1946), initially the "Full Employment Act," later amended in the [[Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act]] (1978). The 1946 act was passed in the aftermath of [[World War II]], when it was feared that demobilization would result in a depression, as it had following [[World War I]] in the [[Depression of 1920–21]], while the 1978 act was passed following the [[1973–75 recession]] and in the midst of continuing high inflation.

The law states that full employment is one of four economic goals, in concert with growth in production, [[price stability]], [[balance of trade]], and [[balanced budget|budget]], and that the US shall rely primarily on private enterprise to achieve these goals. Specifically, the Act is committed to an unemployment rate of no more than 3% for persons aged 20 or over, and not more than 4% for persons aged 16 or over (from 1983 onwards), and the Act expressly ''allows'' (but does not ''require'') the government to create a "reservoir of public employment" to affect this level of employment. These jobs are required to be in the lower ranges of skill and pay so as to not draw the workforce away from the private sector.

However, since the passage of this Act in 1978, the US has, {{as of|2017|lc=yes}}, never achieved this level of employment on the national level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bureau of Labor Statistics Data|url=https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000|website=Bureau of Labor Statistics|publisher=United States Department of Labor|accessdate=6 October 2017|date=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some states have neared it or met it, nor has such a reservoir of public employment been created.

=== Job guarantee ===
{{main|Job guarantee}}
Some, particularly [[Post-Keynesian economists]]&lt;ref&gt;Notably at the [http://www.cfeps.org/ Center for Full Employment and Price Stability], as per references.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested ensuring full employment via a [[job guarantee]] program, where those who are unable to find work in the private sector are employed by the government, the stock of thus employed public sector workers fulfilling the same function as the unemployed do in controlling inflation, without the human costs of unemployment.

He was popularly known by his [[religious name]] Haxhi Qamili, though he was also known as ''Baba Qamili'' (''Father Qamil'').

==Biography==
===Early life===
Qamili was a villager from [[Sharrë|Sharra]] (in [[Tirana]]) and was the [[Sheikh (Sufism)|Sheikh]] of a ''[[Khanqah|tekke]]'' belonging to the [[Malamatiyya|Melami]] order of [[Dervish|dervishes]] that sought social equality and rejected wealth and luxury.{{sfn|Pearson|2004|p=84}}{{sfn|Elsie|2001|p=178}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=pgf6GWJxuZgC&amp;pg=PA376&amp;lpg=PA376&amp;dq=A+Biographical+Dictionary+of+Albanian+History+376&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-Tyt6DsF_H&amp;sig=zcp4PuTkrGOc4WlBiJZSiSoFVo8&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj31cKLj6XPAhVMOhQKHZbzCxAQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=A%2520Biographical%2520Dictionary%2520of%2520Albanian%2520History%2520376&amp;f=false|title=A Biographical Dictionary of Albanian History|last=Elsie|first=Robert|date=2012-12-24|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781780764313|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peasant revolt===
{{main|Peasant Revolt in Albania}}
The uprising began in mid-May 1914, but had its origins in 1913. The rebellion was mainly uphold by illiterate peasants that fearing to lose the lands they were given during the Ottoman Empire objected the laws of a foreign ruler. The uprising base was in the regions of [[Shijak]], [[Kavaja]] and [[Tirana]].

On 3 June 1914, the rebels, who were led by mufti Musa Qazim Beqari, made their demands known at a gathering in Kavaja, among which was the overthrow of the Western-installed [[William, Prince of Albania|Prince Wied]]. The Muslim insurgents demanded the reunion of Albania with the Ottoman state or at least to be ruled by an Ottoman ruler, the reinstatement of the Shariah, the removal of the Albanian flag and its replacement with the Ottoman flag.  

The revolt gained moderate success in central Albania, being able to seize Lushnjë and on 1 September Vlorë. Two days later, Prince Wied in Durrës was forced to abandon his six-month kingdom and the Muslim rebels legislated the re-union of Albania with the Ottoman state. 

With Weid removed, Essad Pasha, who had the support of Italy, returned from exile in October 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=pgf6GWJxuZgC&amp;pg=PA376&amp;lpg=PA376&amp;dq=A+Biographical+Dictionary+of+Albanian+History+376&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-Tyt6DsAZL&amp;sig=tUS1ZWkA-8HzmubGhUjJOdTf-U4&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR4KyajaXPAhXKPxQKHUoVA8IQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=A%2520Biographical%2520Dictionary%2520of%2520Albanian%2520History%2520376&amp;f=false|title=A Biographical Dictionary of Albanian History|last=Elsie|first=Robert|date=2012-12-24|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781780764313|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Characteristics====

Haxhi Qamili's inspiration was [[Musa Qazimi]], a local mufti who supported the [[Young Turks]]' policies.&lt;ref name="Frashëri2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kristo Frashëri|title=Historia e qytetërimit shqiptar: nga kohet e lashta deri ne fund të Luftës së Dytë Botërore|year=2008|publisher=Akademia e Shkencave e Shqipërisë|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qamili referred to Christians, who Haxhi Qamili referred to as "kaurrët"&lt;ref name=DuamBabenTurqine/&gt; (i.e. "heathens", a very pejorative slur when applied by Muslims to Christians&lt;ref name="Vryonis1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Speros Vryonis|title=The Turkish State and History: Clio Meets the Grey Wolf|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTFpAAAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Institute for Balkan Studies|isbn=978-0-89241-532-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and "bad people... who even God doesn't love"&lt;ref name=LulzimHoxha/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jelavich B, History of the Balkans: Twentieth century,The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, UK 1999, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;. During his pro-Ottoman revolt, Christians were slaughtered and tortured.&lt;ref name=LulzimHoxha&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mcser.org/journal/index.php/ajis/article/view/718/749|title=The Making of Political Rituals in Albanian Society|author=Lulzim Hoxha|journal=Academic Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies MCSER Publishing, Rome-Italy|ISSN=2281-3993|page=181|volume=2|number=8|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DuamBabenTurqine/&gt; The movement also attacked Albanian nationalist teachers who had been teaching using the [[Latin alphabet]].&lt;ref name=DuamBabenTurqine/&gt; 

The motto of the rebels was "Duam, duam Babën-- Turqinë!" (We want, we want our father -- Turkey)&lt;ref name=DuamBabenTurqine&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://noa.al/lajmi/2012/01/137668.html|title=A duhet ndryshuar historia e Kombit tonë?|website=noa.al|language=sq|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they raised the flag of the Ottoman Empire and restored Ottoman Turkish as the national language.&lt;ref name=Rrapaj/&gt;

Haxhi Qamili and his movement were opposed by many Albanian Muslims. In the [[Elbasan]] region in particular, local Muslim community leaders and other Muslim notables denounced the movement as "archaic" and "fanatical" with many opposing it with arms. Elbasanlli clerics also supported the Latin alphabet, opposing Haxhi Qamili's view and also the views of more conservative Sunni clerics elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Carcani, Leonard. Fete ne Elbasan. Page 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Rebels killed several Muslim clerics who were involved in Albanian nationalist cycles.&lt;ref name="Shpuza1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gazmend Shpuza|title=Kryengritja fshatare e Shqipërisë së Mesme 1914-1915|year=1986|publisher=Akademia e Shkencave e RPS të Shqipërisë, Instituti i Historisë|p=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War with Essad Pasha===
[[Essad Pasha Toptani]], a supporter of the feudal lords, took power with Serbian support.{{sfn|Pollo|Puto|1981|p=164}} Qamili became one of the leaders of the renewed rebellion and was elected by the Islamic rebels as their commander-in-chief.{{sfn|Frashëri|1964|p=196}} by the end of November 1914, the rebels had regained the upper hand in Tirana and burnt Essad Pasha’s palace to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=pgf6GWJxuZgC&amp;pg=PA376&amp;lpg=PA376&amp;dq=A+Biographical+Dictionary+of+Albanian+History+376&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-Tyt6DsF_H&amp;sig=zcp4PuTkrGOc4WlBiJZSiSoFVo8&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj31cKLj6XPAhVMOhQKHZbzCxAQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=A%2520Biographical%2520Dictionary%2520of%2520Albanian%2520History%2520376&amp;f=false|title=A Biographical Dictionary of Albanian History|last=Elsie|first=Robert|date=2012-12-24|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781780764313|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion achieved rapid successes, confining Essad's government of central Albania to Durrës itself.{{sfn|Pollo|Puto|1981|p=165}}

With the start of the First World War, Albania was invaded by Greek, Italian and Serbian forces, which changed the situation of the uprising entirely. In January 1915 Qamili along with other rebel leaders convened a National Congress in Tirana, declaring on behalf of the whole Albanian people the illegitimacy of Essad's [[Durrës]]-based government while affirming Albanian neutrality in World War I.{{sfn|Pearson|2004|p=87}} In May 1915 Qamili was elected leader of the rebels.&lt;ref name="IslamiFrashëri1968"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Selim Islami|author2=Kristo Frashëri|author3=Aleks Buda|title=Historia e popullit shqiptar: Përgatitur nga një kolektiv punonjësish shkencorë të sektorëve të historisë së kohës së lashtë dhe të kohës së mesme|year=1968|publisher=Enti i teksteve dhe i mjeteve mësimore i Krahinës Socialiste Autonome të Kosovës|p=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
In an effort to aid Essad's government and to further its own territorial aims, the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] launched an invasion of central Albania on June 2, 1915 but was promptly met by resistance led by Qamili at [[Qukës]] where, however, the rebels' outnumbered and outgunned forces were defeated by the Serbs.{{sfn|Frashëri|1964|p=198}} Through this intervention the "rebellion, with [its] vague, unsettled political objectives, which did, nevertheless, have both a popular and a social basis" was suppressed.{{sfn|Pollo|Puto|1981|p=165}} The Serbian forces arrested Qamili and other rebel leaders and sent them as prisoners to Durrës, where they were tried in a court presided over by [[Xhelal Bey Zogu]] and sentenced to be hanged.{{sfn|Pearson|2004|p=90}}

==Analysis==
[[Enver Hoxha]] believed that the peasant movement under Qamili's direction was primarily one of the rural poor, which relied upon traditional forms of government such as village councils to organize and direct a struggle against feudal interests.{{sfn|Hoxha|1977|p=142}} Qamili preached that all property in excess of personal needs should be given to the impoverished, quoting the [[Quran]] and also expressing the sentiment of the Melami sect, which was against the concept of [[private property]].{{sfn|Pollo|Puto|1981|pp=164–165}} Works published during the communist period stated that the peasant rebels under Qamili's command confiscated the estates of the large landowners, set fire to houses of the ''[[bey]]s'', and provided support for the poor, infirm and orphans.{{sfn|Frashëri|1964|p=196}} Hoxha summed up Qamili's movement as being "against the feudal lords, pashas, beys and [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]]s, landowners and privileges in general."{{sfn|Hoxha|1977|p=171}}

Modern historiography has criticized this portrayal of Haxhi Qamili and his movement by works published under the communist regime, lambasting them as "[[Albanian historiography]] which tried to prove Hoxha's truths instead of searching for the truth".&lt;ref name=Rrapaj&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3f15/513b82a404abb6ec0b301dcd69920ac3c01f.pdf|author=Jonilda Rrapaj and Klevis Kolasi|title=The Curious Case of Albanian Nationalism: the Crooked Line from a Scattered Array of Clans to a Nation-State|publisher=Ankara University, Faculty of Political Science|journal=The Turkish Yearbook of International Relations|volume=43|year=2013|pages=185-228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disputing the communist line that the movement was egalitarian, progressive and "anti-feudal", Kolasi and Rrapaj maintain that the revolt was a "reactionary Muslim uprising" motivated by the "fear of peasants that their lands would be taken by the new government"&lt;ref name=Rrapaj/&gt; (during the early period of Albanian independence, a controversial issue was [[land reform]] and redistribution to address the situation of disparity whereby Christians had much less land than Muslims due to legalized discrimination in the time of the Ottoman Empire). Kolasi and Rrapaj also note the desire of peasants for a return to Ottoman rule, the replacement of Albanian with Ottoman Turkish as the official language, and the raising of the Ottoman flag.&lt;ref name=Rrapaj/&gt; Lulzim Hoxha meanwhile argues that the movement shows the "worship towards the central authorities as a patrimonial figure" and the perceived "necessity of a central paternal authority" under a "Sultanistic" political culture that he views as inherited from Ottoman rule but continued and sharpened under [[Enver Hoxha]]'s communist regime noting that the movement used as a slogan "dum Baben" (we want our Father)&lt;ref name=LulzimHoxha/&gt;. He analyzes the slaughters of Christians involved as an attempt to "fill up the ideological place prepared and cultivated during the Ottoman dominion with humiliating acts for the Christians".&lt;ref name=LulzimHoxha/&gt;

The '''Honduran Social Security Institute''' (Instituto Hondureño de Seguro Social or IHSS in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) is a [[Honduras|Honduran]] program that provides pensions and healthcare coverage. It was inaugurated in 1959 when the "Social Security Law of Honduras" was approved during the constitutional presidency of [[Ramón Villeda Morales]]. Honduran Institute assistance centers were created and formal operations began on March 1, 1962.

During the administration of [[Porfirio Lobo]], [[Mario Zelaya]] was appointed as director of the Honduran Institute of Social Security. Mario Zelaya, took advantage of his position and the finances he handled to allegedly embezzle the institution of 325 million Lempiras (US $ 13.8 million dollars)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latribuna.hn/2014/09/09/mario-zelaya-cerebro-de-la-red-de-corrupcion-del-ihss/ Mario Zelaya: “Cerebro de la red de corrupción del IHSS”] La Tribuna.hn&lt;/ref&gt; using a network of front men,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elheraldo.hn/pais/708241-214/esposas-de-exfuncionaros-del-ihss-dirig%C3%ADan-red-de-testaferros Esposas de exfuncionarios del IHSS dirigían red de testaferros] El Heraldo.hn&lt;/ref&gt; including the former deputy minister of health, Javier Pastor and the former deputy minister of labor, Carlos Montes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laprensa.hn/honduras/apertura/745205-96/dictan-prisi%C3%B3n-preventiva-a-javier-pastor-y-carlos-montes Dictan prisión preventiva a Javier Pastor y Carlos Montes] La Prensa.hn&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiempo.hn/naci%C3%B3n/item/824-lista-de-capturados-tras-defalco-econ%C3%B3mico-en-el-ihss Lista de capturados tras defalco económico en el IHSS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224143003/http://www.tiempo.hn/naci%C3%B3n/item/824-lista-de-capturados-tras-defalco-econ%C3%B3mico-en-el-ihss |date=2014-12-24 }} Tiempo.hn&lt;/ref&gt; An alleged result of this fraud was the unnecessary death of almost 3,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latribuna.hn/2015/05/28/cerca-de-tres-mil-personas-han-muerto-por-descalabro-en-el-ihss/|title=Cerca de tres mil personas han muerto por descalabro en el IHSS|date=28 May 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ibrahim Index of African Governance''' (IIAG), established in 2007, provides an annual assessment of the quality of governance in African countries.  Compiled by combining over 100 variables from more than 30 independent African and global institutions, the IIAG is the most comprehensive collection of data on African governance.

The IIAG provides a framework for citizens, governments, institutions and the private sector to accurately assess the delivery of public goods and services, and policy outcomes, across the continent.  As well as being a tool to help determine and debate government performance, the IIAG is a decision-making instrument with which to govern.

The Foundation defines governance as the provision of the political, social and economic goods that a citizen has the right to expect from his or her state, and that a state has the responsibility to deliver to its citizens.  The IIAG assesses progress under four main conceptual categories: ''Safety &amp; Rule of Law, Participation &amp; Human Rights, Sustainable Economic Opportunity, and Human Development''. These four pillars are populated with data that cover governance elements ranging from infrastructure to freedom of expression and sanitation to property rights.

The IIAG allows users to benchmark governance performance across a number of dimensions at the national, regional and continental levels.  Scores and ranks are available for all years from 2000, enabling the analysis of trends over time.  All of the underlying data used in the construction of the IIAG are freely available and transparently published alongside a comprehensive methodology.

== History ==

The Ibrahim Index of African Governance is a key initiative of the [[Mo Ibrahim Foundation]]. It has been published annually since 2007, with launch events in various African cities, including [[Accra]], [[Cairo]], [[Dakar]], [[Johannesburg]] and [[Nairobi]]. The most recent iteration of the Index, the 2015 IIAG was published in October 2015.

The index was initially produced in association with [[Harvard University]]; academic and technical assistance has subsequently been provided by a range of African academics and research bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/iiag/ Mo Ibrahim Foundation Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ibrahim Index has been used by civil society and government bodies across the continent to monitor governance. One example is in [[South Africa]], where the party in opposition, the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]], used the Ibrahim Index to challenge the government's record on safety and security.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mg.co.za/article/2007-09-27-da-sa-safety-utterly-abysmal&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==

The Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG) is an annually published composite index that provides a statistical measure of governance performance in African countries.

Governance is defined by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation as the provision of the political, social and economic public goods and services that a citizen has the right to expect from his or her state, and that a state has the responsibility to deliver to its citizens. This definition is focused on outputs and outcomes of policy. The IIAG governance framework comprises four dimensions (categories):

*Safety &amp; Rule of Law
*Participation &amp; Human Rights
*Sustainable Economic Opportunity
*Human Development

These categories are made up of 14 sub-categories, consisting of over 100 indicators. The latest IIAG is calculated using data from more than 30 independent sources.
Annual refinements are made to the IIAG, which may be methodological, or based on the inclusion or exclusion of indicators. The entire IIAG data set is therefore retrospectively revised, in accordance with best practices. Comparisons between years should therefore be performed entirely on the 2013 IIAG data set.

== Indicators ==

The latest IIAG comprises over 100 indicators, grouped into four broad categories: Safety &amp; Rule of Law, Participation and Human Rights, Sustainable Economic Opportunity and Human Development.

=== Safety and Rule of Law ===

== Utility ==
The IIAG is designed to be a tool for citizens, governments, institutions and business to assess the delivery of public goods and services, and policy outcomes, across Africa. It is an annual publication which receives extensive media attention from across the African continent and in the international media.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.good.is/post/ibrahim-index-of-african-governance/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mg.co.za/tag/ibrahim-index-of-african-governance&lt;/ref&gt;

While no one questions the worthiness of the Index's ambitions, some scholars have questioned the effectiveness of the Index and particularly the need for civil society to engage with its results &amp;mdash; the point is that there does not often exist in Africa a strong and effective civil society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.africanprogress.net/ibrahim-leadership-prize-index-revisited.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Others maintain that such perspective ignores the important role that civil society is now beginning to play in African politics.{{Who|date=June 2016}}

While the IIAG is comprehensive, there are a few notable anomalies thrown by the results. One example is the extremely high placing of [[Gabon]] (8 out of 48 Sub-Saharan African countries);&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalafricansociety.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=424&lt;/ref&gt; however, while Gabon's political participation and human rights record may be poor, it does have relatively high human development indicators.

Previous critique suggested that the Index was limited to the 48 Sub-Saharan African countries, ignoring [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]] and [[Egypt]]. To be a fully representative Index of African Governance, as it claimed, it needed to expand its coverage to include North Africa. The 2009 index included these countries.

Communications between interlocutors are often useful at conveying information and ideas. Often interlocutors will talk with each other before formal negotiations. Interlocutors play an extremely important role in [[Sino-American relations]].

The '''International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament''' is a joint initiative of the [[Australia]]n and [[Japan]]ese governments. It was proposed by Australian Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] on 9 June 2008, and on 9 July 2008 Rudd and Japanese Prime Minister [[Yasuo Fukuda]] agreed to establish it. 

The Commission is co-chaired by former Australian foreign minister [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]] and former Japanese foreign minister [[Yoriko Kawaguchi]]. Key goals for the Commission include undertaking preparatory work for the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] Review Conference in 2010, including shaping a global consensus in the lead-up to the Review Conference.

The Commission presented its report on 15 December 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3185">The '''Kileler uprising''' occurred  in [[Thessaly]], [[Kingdom of Greece]], in March 1910, when local farmers engaged in mass protests against the extended privileges of landowners and the limitation of their own rights. The protest was brutally suppressed by the local militia; more than four protesters were killed and many of them were wounded.

== Background ==
Even though the mainly agricultural province of [[Thessaly]] was given from the [[Ottoman Empire]] to the Kingdom of Greece through the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)|Convention of Constantinoupole]] in 1881, rural areas continued for many years to be regulated through the [[Chiflik (Ottoman Empire)|Chiflik]] system, which derived from the Ottoman times. While the chiflik owners held a semi-feudal status and received a part of the agricultural output they were obliged to provide housing for their farmers and weren't allowed to apply forced labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reinders|first=Reinder|title=Pharos: Journal of the Netherlands Institute at Athens: Volume VXI (2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-50S1VrRaWIC&amp;pg=PA88|publisher=Uitgeverij Van Gorcum|isbn=9780013802242|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the living and working conditions of the farmers worsened, protests became more frequent especially after the assassination of figures like activist [[Marinos Antypas]]. The promises of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] during his 1910 electoral campaign concerning agricultural reform further aggravated the farmers. In March 1910 the farmers organized a mass protest in [[Larissa]] and villagers from many areas of the prefecture travelled to city.

The Kileler incident began when several hundred farmers tried to travel by train to Larissa without buying tickets. When their request was rejected the farmers backed down but a confrontation occurred between them and the station supervisor, who asked for the intervention of the local militia that attacked the farmers killing two of them and wounding many others. When the train reached the station of Tsoular (modern Melia) it didn't stop to pick up farmers, of whom two were shot dead by the militia located inside the train. As news of the killings spread in Larissa clashes between the militia and the protesters became frequent.

== Aftermath ==
Many of the farmers were tried for the events of the protests, but none were sentenced.

Eventually the need of the central government to use farmers as recruits and after 1922 the settlement of [[refugees from Asia Minor]] in Greece led to the implementation of a 1917 law regarding land redestribution.&lt;ref name="Lazaridis2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lazaridis|first=Gabriella|title=Women's work and lives in rural Greece: appearances and realities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-DvKb3VDzoC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=5 March 2012|date=2008-09-24|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=9780754612124|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Langar''' is the provision of free food to the needy in a religious context. Its origin is from [[Sufism]] ([[Islam]]) because serving of food to the needy has been a rich tradition in Sufism, especially of the [[Chishti Order]]. There is extensive use of free food imagery and metaphor in Sufi writings. Sugar and other sweet foods represent the sweetness of piety and community with God, while salt symbolizes purity and incorruptibility. Through the pronouncement of [[Bismallah]] during the bread-making process, the bread is imbued with spiritual power or [[Barakah|barakat]], which is shared by those who eat the bread. The transformation of the raw [[wheat]] to finished bread is used as an analogy for Sufi [[spiritual development]].

Sufi ritual observances ([[dhikr]]) are concerned with remembrance of God through exaltation and praise. Singing, dancing, and drumming are commonly part of such rituals, as is sharing of food. For example, [[Ashure|ashura]] is a dish that takes its name from [[Ashura|the festival]] celebrated by the [[Shia]] sect of Islam. During preparation of the ashura, [[Mullah|mulla]]s stir the pot in a special way while pronouncing the name of God. Sharing the ashura then becomes a way of spreading remembrance of God in the form of bodily nourishment.

The tradition of Langar was also adopted by the Sikh community, where it goes by the [[Langar (Sikhism)|same name]].

Food is served out of a massive{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=March 2016}} pot called a ''deg'' in the precincts of a [[dargah]] (Sufi shrine), and is usually vegetarian. It is also actively distributed to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Seidel, ''[http://www.superluminal.com/cookbook/essay_serving_love.html Serving Love]'', ''Serving the Guest: A Sufi Cookbook", September 2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15364">'''Liberal Women of Chesterfield County (LWCC)''' is a  [[Facebook]] group of liberal women activists organized to support Democratic candidates in [[Chesterfield County, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Meet the liberal women who are angry, engaged and ready to vote |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/04/politics/virginia-liberal-women-weir/index.html |website=CNN |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "LWCC strives to be a safe haven for liberal women and their allies to support, educate, and encourage one another to be actively involved in our government..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fleishman |first1=Jeffrey |title=Cultural Divide: Books, poems and the Doors inspire liberal women in Virginia against Trump and conservatives - Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-ca-liberal-women-chesterfield-county-cultural-divide-20181011-story.html |accessdate=12 October 2018 |work=latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to the formation of LWCC, "90 for 90" was a get-out-the vote program begun in 2015 by Democrats in Chesterfield County to honor the 90th birthday of [[William Ferguson Reid|Dr. William Ferguson "Fergie" Reid]], especially in [[gerrymandered]] districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=liberalchesterfield |url=https://www.liberalwomenofchesterfieldcounty.com |website=liberalchesterfield |accessdate=5 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; An initial goal of the "90 for 90" program was to find a candidate to defeat Republican [[Eric Cantor]], then the House majority leader. Many of the women and men present at that meeting sponsored by the Chesterfield Democratic Party became newly energized activists in Virginia politics, lobbying about their issues at the [[Virginia State Capitol]] building and before the [[Virginia General Assembly]]. Some also became stalwarts in advocating for other issues such as quality of education, racial justice, environmentalism, women's health and safety, and passage of the ERA. They also engaged in the close final vote re-counts in the race for [[Attorney General of Virginia]], which was won by a triple-digit vote count by Democrat [[Mark Herring]] over Republican [[Mark Obenshain]]. Many people in the "90 for 90" Democratic advocacy group eventually became members of Liberal Women of Chesterfield County, which also drew membership from  the Chesterfield Democratic Committee and lobbyists such as the [[Sierra Club]] and the [[League of Women Voters]].

Since the LWCC group is in the 7th Congressional District, a rural-suburban mix that stretches from [[Culpeper County]] to [[Nottoway County]], and since the group membership grew to over 4000 people including some outside the district, it is sometimes called "Liberal Women of Chesterfield County - and Beyond."

LWCC engages in community volunteerism beyond politics. LWCC members have stocked the high school food go-home pantries of needy teens of Chesterfield County and teamed up with local organization "Sylvia Sisters" to ensure that needy girls get feminine hygiene products both locally and in [[Uganda]]. LWCC advocacy groups ensure that members are given needed supplies, and they volunteer hours to public schools. They also participated in a highway clean-up project,"Adopt a Highway". The organization Liberal Women of Chesterfield County is creating a national guide, Liberal Women United, a website for branches of similarly-minded women around the United States.

==Contest between Spanberger and Brat==

For the mid-term 2018 elections, LWCC focused on the race between Democrat [[Abigail Spanberger]], a former CIA operative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wilson |first1=Patrick |title=Abigail Spanberger's passion for languages led her to the CIA |url=https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/abgail-spanberger-s-passion-for-languages-led-her-to-the/article_d99787c8-8f5a-5e99-946c-be207565f62f.html |website=Richmond Times-Dispatch |accessdate=25 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shroder |first1=Landon |title=Former CIA Agent Abigail Spanberger is on a Mission for Virginia’s 7th District |url=https://rvamag.com/politics/virginia-politics/former-cia-agent-abigail-spanberger-is-on-a-mission-for-virginias-7th-district.html |website=RVA Magazine |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dave Brat|Rep.

Ryan]] (R-Wis.), aired the anti-Spanberger ad that centered on her brief work as a substitute teacher at an [[Islamic]] school in Alexandria, Virginia.

==Post card campaign==
LWCC members met frequently to write and mail post cards to voters in the 7th Congressional District of Virginia in support of favored candidates throughout the Commonwealth. In 2018's [[mid-term elections]], candidates supported by this program were Scott Miles, Democrat running for Chesterfield County [[Commonwealth's Attorney]]; Democratic Senator, [[Tim Kaine]] running for re-election; and Abigail Spanberger, Democrat and former [[CIA]] officer, opposing in her first run for political office incumbent [[Dave Brat]], [[U.S. Representative]] for Virginia's 7th congressional district since 2014, when he defeated [[Eric Cantor]] in the Republican primary. The energetic post card campaign, along with door-to-door canvassing, proved successful. Scott Miles, Abigail Spanberger, and Tim Kaine were all elected.

==Fundraising==
Fundraising ranged from the local level to the national level. Many groups and individuals have sent donations directly to LWCC candidates' campaigns and endorsed them. Creative ways are found to support fundraisers for LWCC candidates, including hosting parties in members' homes for which tickets are sold. Telephone-banking (phone calls to voters with reminders of election and rally days) and Facebook sharing of events sponsored by LWCC help members to keep in touch for carpooling and door-to-door canvassing.

==ERA==
After [[Donald Trump]]'s election in 2016, a group of liberal women in Chesterfield County, Virginia, a traditionally conservative part of the Commonwealth of Virgina, joined together as activists to work for change. [[CNN|CNN's]] [[Bill Weir]] reported on their progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Virginia women take action ahead of midterms - CNN Video |url=https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/10/04/liberal-women-of-chesterfield-county-weir-dnt-vpx.cnn |website=CNN |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of LWCC support many other active liberal progressive groups addressing issues such as the Equal Rights Amendment. LWCC is not a [[voting bloc]], and efforts are underway to consider and promote the ERA as a [[non-partisan]] issue.

==Candidates==
Some local and national candidates supported by most LWCC members include [[Abigail Spanberger]], Jenefer Hughes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Times-Dispatch |first1=VANESSA REMMERS Richmond |title=In Chesterfield, Democrat defeats Republican incumbent in race for commissioner of the revenue |url=https://www.richmond.com/news/election-coverage/in-chesterfield-democrat-defeats-republican-incumbent-in-race-for-commissioner/article_c8e202b0-2310-5fba-8129-bb2603a0b03c.html |website=Richmond Times-Dispatch |accessdate=17 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Miles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Republicans pick Childrey to run in Commonwealth's  Attorney's race {{!}} Chesterfield Observer |url=https://www.chesterfieldobserver.com/articles/republicans-pick-childrey-to-run-in-commonwealths-attorneys-race/ |website=www.chesterfieldobserver.com |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wayne Powell, [[Jack Trammell]], [[Ralph Northam]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Mark Herring]], [[Barack Obama]], and [[Tim Kaine]].

Democrat Jenefer Hughes challenged incumbent Republican Timothy McPeters in a special election to be Chesterfield Commissioner of Revenue and won by 55% of the vote. “Chesterfield County has changed. Chesterfield County is very balanced between Democrats and Republicans. And my election actually reflects that,” Hughes said. “It’s the first step to getting fair representation to 2019, when all the local offices come up for election.”

==Debates==
Prior to the 2018 [[mid-term elections]], [[Abigail Spanberger]] vs. [[Dave Brat]] debates ended with the Republican candidate Brat complaining that the LWCC women were "in his grill" at debates, rallies, and other public appearances. Abigail Spanberger and Dave Brat debated on October 15, 2018, a debate marked by the fact that Brat mentioned [[Nancy Pelosi]] 21 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fuller |first1=Matt |title=GOP Congressman Somehow Manages To Mention Nancy Pelosi 21 Times In A Debate |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nancy-pelosi-abigail-spanberger-dave-brat_us_5bc52fa4e4b055bc9478f684?ncid=engmodushpmg00000003 |accessdate=16 October 2018 |work=Huffington Post |date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wilson |first1=Patrick |title=Brat and Spanberger argue taxes, health care and immigration in what may be only debate |url=https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/brat-and-spanberger-argue-taxes-health-care-and-immigration-in/article_d4f24cbc-9991-576e-9322-d9c58bf8d959.html |accessdate=24 October 2018 |work=Richmond Times-Dispatch |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also the motto of the [[Grand Orient de France]] and the [[Grande Loge de France]].

==Origins during the French Revolution==
[[File:LibertyEqualityorDeath.jpg|thumb|Text displayed on a placard announcing the sale of ''[[biens nationaux]]'' (1793). Soon after the Revolution, the motto was sometimes written as "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death". The "death" part was later dropped for being too strongly associated with the [[Reign of Terror]].]]
The first to express this motto was [[Maximilien Robespierre]] in his speech ''"On the organization of the National Guard"'' ({{lang-fr|Discours sur l'organisation des gardes nationales}}) on 5 December 1790, article XVI, and disseminated widely throughout France by the popular Societies.

{{quote|'''Discours sur l'organisation des gardes nationales'''&lt;br /&gt;Article XVI.&lt;br /&gt;On their uniforms engraved these words: FRENCH PEOPLE, &amp; below: LIBERTY, EQUALITY, FRATERNITY. The same words are inscribed on flags which bear the three colors of the nation.&lt;br /&gt;({{lang-fr|XVI.

Credit for the motto has been given also to [[Antoine-François Momoro]] (1756–94), a Parisian printer and [[Hébertists|Hébertist]] organizer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Famous Sayings and Their Authors |last=Latham |first=Edward |year=1906 |publisher=Swan Sonnenschein |location=London |oclc=4697187 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xvkNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA147 |pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Amable Guillaume P.

it was modified to "Unity, indivisibility of the Republic; liberty, equality, brotherhood or death" ({{lang-fr|Unité, Indivisibilité de la République; Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité ou la mort}}) and suggested by a resolution of the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]] (member of which Momoro was elected by his [[section du Théâtre-Français]]) on 29 June 1793 to be inscribed on Parisian house-fronts and imitated by the inhabitants of other cities. In 1839, the philosopher [[Pierre Leroux]] claimed it had been an anonymous and popular creation.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} The historian Mona Ozouf underlines that, although ''Liberté'' and ''Égalité'' were associated as a motto during the 18th century, ''Fraternité'' wasn't always included in it, and other terms, such as ''Amitié'' (Friendship), ''Charité'' (Charity) or ''Union'' were often added in its place.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

The emphasis on ''Fraternité'' during the French Revolution led [[Olympe de Gouges]], a female journalist, to write the [[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=World History |contribution=The Modern Era |last1=Ellis |last2=Esler |type=textbook}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} as a response. The tripartite motto was neither a creative collection, nor really institutionalized by the French Revolution.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; As soon as 1789, other terms were used, such as "''la Nation, la Loi, le Roi''" (The Nation, The Law, The King), or "''Union, Force, Vertu''" (Union, Strength, Virtue), a slogan used beforehand by [[Freemasonry|masonic lodges]], or "''Force, Égalité, Justice''" (Strength, Equality, Justice), "''Liberté, Sûreté, Propriété''" (Liberty, Security, Property), etc.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

[[File:Enseigne Alsacienne revolutionnaire.jpg|thumb|upright|Alsatian sign, 1792:&lt;br /&gt;
''Freiheit Gleichheit Brüderlichk. od. Tod'' (Liberty Equality Fraternity or Death)&lt;br /&gt;
''Tod den Tyranen'' (Death to Tyrants)&lt;br /&gt;
''Heil den Völkern'' (Long live the Peoples)]]
In other words, ''liberté, égalité, fraternité'' was only one slogan among many others.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; During the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin]] revolutionary period itself, various mottos were used, such as ''liberté, unité, égalité'' (liberty, unity, equality); ''liberté, égalité, justice'' (liberty, equality, justice); ''liberté, raison, égalité'' (liberty, reason, equality), etc.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; The only solid association was that of ''liberté'' and ''égalité'', ''fraternité'' being ignored by the ''[[Cahiers de doléances]]'' as well as by the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]. It was only alluded to in the 1791 [[French Constitution|Constitution]], as well as in [[Robespierre]]'s draft Declaration of 1793, placed under the invocation of (in that order) ''égalité, liberté, sûreté'' and ''propriété'' (equality, liberty, safety, property — though it was used not as a motto, but as articles of declaration), as the possibility of a universal extension of the Declaration of Rights: "Men of all countries are brothers, he who oppresses one nation declares himself the enemy of all."&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;{{Efn |French: "''Les hommes de tous les pays sont frères, celui qui opprime une seule nation se déclare l'ennemi de toutes.''"}} Finally, it did not figure in the August 1793 Declaration.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] of 1789 defined liberty in Article 4 as follows:

{{quote|Liberty consists of being able to do anything that does not harm others: thus, the exercise of the natural rights of every man or woman has no bounds other than those that guarantee other members of society the enjoyment of these same rights.}}

Equality, on the other hand, was defined by the 1789 Declaration in terms of judicial equality and merit-based entry to government (art. 6):

{{quote|[The law] must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes. All citizens, being equal in its eyes, shall be equally eligible to all high offices, public positions and employments, according to their ability, and without other distinction than that of their virtues and talents.}}

''Liberté, égalité, fraternité'' actually finds its origins in a May 1791 proposition by the ''[[Cordeliers|Club des Cordeliers]]'', following a speech on the Army by the [[marquis de Guichardin]].&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; A British marine held prisoner on the French ship ''Le Marat'' in 1794 wrote home in letters published in 1796:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Letters Written in France: To a Friend in London, Between the Month of November 1794, and the Month of May 1795 |first=Watkin |last=Tench |place=London |publisher=J Johnson |year=1796 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ztMuAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA15 |page=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The republican spirit is inculcated not in songs only, for in every part of the ship I find emblems purposely displayed to awaken it. All the orders relating to the discipline of the crew are hung up, and prefaced by the words ''Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité, ou la Mort'', written in capital letters.}}

The compatibility of ''liberté'' and ''égalité'' was not doubted in the first days of the Revolution, and the problem of the antecedence of one term on the other not lifted.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; Thus, the [[Abbé Sieyès]] considered that only liberty ensured equality, unless the latter was to be the equality of all dominated by a [[Despotism|despot]]; while liberty followed equality ensured by the rule of law.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; The abstract generality of law (theorized by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in ''[[The Social Contract]]'') thus ensured the identification of liberty to equality, liberty being negatively defined as an independence from arbitrary rule, and equality considered abstractly in its judicial form.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

This identification of liberty and equality became problematic during the Jacobin period, when equality was redefined (for instance by [[François-Noël Babeuf]]) as [[Equality of outcome|equality of results]], and not only judicial equality of rights.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; Thus, [[Marc Antoine Baudot]] considered that French temperament inclined rather to equality than liberty, a theme which would be re-used by [[Pierre Louis Roederer]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], while [[Jacques Necker]] considered that an equal society could only be found on coercion.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

The third term, ''fraternité'', was the most problematic to insert in the triad, as it belonged to another sphere, that of moral obligations rather than rights, links rather than statutes, harmony rather than [[Freedom of contract|contract]], and community rather than individuality.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; Various interpretations of ''fraternité'' existed. The first one, according to Mona Ozouf, was one of "''fraternité de rébellion''" (Fraternity of Rebellion),&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; that is the union of the deputies in the ''[[Tennis Court Oath|Jeu de Paume Oath]]'' of June 1789, refusing the dissolution ordered by the King [[Louis XVI]]: "We swear never to separate ourselves from the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], and to reassemble wherever circumstances require, until the constitution of the realm is drawn up and fixed upon solid foundations." Fraternity was thus issued from Liberty and oriented by a common cause.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

Another form of ''fraternité'' was that of the patriotic Church, which identified social link with religious link and based fraternity on Christian brotherhood.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; In this second sense, ''fraternité'' preceded both ''liberté'' and ''égalité'', instead of following them as in the first sense.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} Thus, two senses of Fraternity: "one, that followed liberty and equality, was the object of a free pact; the other preceded liberty and equality as the mark on its work of the divine craftsman."&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

Another hesitation concerning the compatibility of the three terms arose from the opposition between liberty and equality as [[Individualism|individualistic]] values, and fraternity as the realization of a happy community, devoided of any conflicts and opposed to any form of [[egotism]].&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; This fusional interpretation of Fraternity opposed it to the project of [[Self-ownership|individual autonomy]] and manifested the precedence of Fraternity on individual will.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

In this sense, it was sometimes associated with death, as in ''Fraternité, ou la Mort!'' (Fraternity or Death!), excluding liberty and even equality, by establishing a strong dichotomy between those who were brothers and those who were not (in the sense of "[[You're either with us, or against us|you are with me or against me]]", brother or foe).&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} [[Louis de Saint-Just]] thus stigmatized [[Anarchasis Cloots]]' [[cosmopolitanism]], declaring "Cloots liked the universe, except France."&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

With [[Thermidorian Reaction|Thermidor]] and the execution of Robespierre, ''fraternité'' disappeared from the slogan, reduced to the two terms of liberty and equality, re-defined again as simple judicial equality and not as the equality upheld by the sentiment of fraternity.&lt;ref name=Ozouf/&gt; The [[First Consul]] ([[Napoleon Bonaparte]]) then established the motto ''liberté, ordre public'' (liberty, public order).

==19th century==
Following Napoleon's rule, the triptych dissolved itself, as none believed possible to conciliate individual liberty and equality of rights with [[Equality of outcome|equality of results]] and fraternity.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; The idea of [[Self-ownership|individual sovereignty]] and of [[natural rights]] possessed by man before being united in the collectivity contradicted the possibility of establishing a transparent and fraternal community.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; [[Liberalism|Liberals]] accepted liberty and equality, defining the latter as equality of rights and ignoring fraternity.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

[[Utopian socialism|Early socialists]] rejected an independent conception of liberty, opposed to the social, and also despised equality, as they considered, as [[Charles Fourier|Fourier]], that one had only to orchestrate individual discordances, to harmonize them, or they believed, as [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], that equality contradicted [[Equity (economics)|equity]] by a brutal levelling of individualities.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; Utopian socialism thus only valued fraternity, which was, in [[Etienne Cabet|Cabet]]'s [[Icarians|Icarie]] the sole commandment.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

This opposition between liberals and socialists was mirrored in rival historical interpretations of the Revolution, liberals admiring 1789, and socialists 1793.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; The [[July Revolution]] of 1830, establishing a constitutional monarchy headed by [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]], substituted ''ordre et liberté'' (order and liberty) to the Napoleonic motto ''Liberté, Ordre public''.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; Despite this apparent disappearance of the triptych, the latter was still being thought in some underground circles, in Republican [[secret societies]], masonic lodges such as the "Indivisible Trinity," far-left booklets or during the [[Canuts Revolt]] in Lyon.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; In 1834, the lawyer of the [[Society of the Rights of Man]] (Société des droits de l'homme), [[Jacques-Charles Dupont de l'Eure|Dupont]], a liberal sitting in the far-left during the [[July Monarchy]], associated the three terms together in the ''[[Revue Républicaine]]'' which he edited:

{{quote|Any man aspires to liberty, to equality, but he can not achieve it without the assistance of other men, without fraternity&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;{{Efn |French: "''Tout homme aspire à la liberté, à l'égalité, mais on ne peut y atteindre sans le secours des autres hommes, sans la fraternité.''"}}}}

The triptych resurfaced during the 1847 ''[[Campagne des Banquets]]'', upheld for example in [[Lille]] by [[Ledru-Rollin]].&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

Two interpretations had attempted to conciliate the three terms, beyond the antagonism between liberals and socialists. One was upheld by Catholic traditionalists, such as [[Chateaubriand]] or [[Ballanche]], the other by socialist and republicans such as [[Pierre Leroux]].&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; Chateaubriand thus gave a Christian interpretation of the revolutionary motto, stating in the 1841 conclusion to his ''Mémoires d'outre-tombe'':

{{quote|Far from being at its term, the religion of the Liberator is now only just entering its third phase, the political period, liberty, equality, fraternity&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;{{Efn |French: "''Loin d'être à son terme, la religion du Libérateur entre à peine dans sa troisième période, la période politique, liberté, égalité, fraternité.''"}}}}

Neither Chateaubriand nor Ballanche considered the three terms to be antagonistic. Rather, they took them for being the achievement of Christianity. On the other hand, Pierre Leroux did not disguise the difficulties of associating the three terms, but superated it by considering liberty as the aim, equality as the principle and fraternity as the means.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; Leroux thus ordered the motto as Liberty, Fraternity, Equality,&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; an order also supported by [[Christian socialism|Christian socialists]], such as [[Buchez]].&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

Against this new order of the triptych, [[Jules Michelet|Michelet]] supported the traditional order, maintaining the primordial importance of an original individualistic right.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; Michelet attempted to conciliate a rational communication with a fraternal communication, "right beyond right",&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} and thus the rival traditions of socialism and liberalism.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; The [[republicanism|republican]] tradition would strongly inspire itself from Michelet's synchretism.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

===1848 Revolution===

}}
With the [[1848 February Revolution]], the motto was officially adopted,&lt;ref name="Frenchsymbols"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (France)|French Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/france_159/discovering-france_2005/france-from-to-z_1978/the-symbols-of-the-republic-and-bastille-day_2002/ |title=The symbols of the Republic and Bastille Day |accessdate=2006-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly under the pressure of the people who had attempted to impose the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] over the [[Flag of France|tricolor flag]] (the 1791 red flag was, however, the symbol of martial law and of order, not of insurrection).&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; [[Lamartine]] opposed popular aspirations, and in exchange of the maintaining of the tricolor flag, conceded the Republican motto of ''Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité'', written on the flag, on which a red rosette was also to be added.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

Fraternity was then considered to resume and to contain both Liberty and Equality, being a form of civil religion (which, far from opposing itself to Christianity, was associated with it in 1848&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2014}}) establishing social link (as called for by Rousseau in the conclusion of the ''Social Contract'').&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

However, Fraternity was not devoid of its previous sense of opposition between brothers and foes, images of blood haunting revolutionary Christian publications, taking in [[Lamennais]]' themes.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; Thus, the newspaper ''[[Le Christ républicain]]'' (The Republican Christ) developed the idea of the Christ bringing forth peace to the poor and war to the rich.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Le Christ républicain'' n°7, quoted by Mona Ozouf: "''Nous, pauvres prolétaires, nous sommes rouges, parce que le Christ a versé son sang pour nous racheter, son sang par lequel nous voulons nous régénérer. Nous sommes rouges, parce que l'ange exterminateur a marqué le haut de nos portes avec le sang de l'agneau, pour distinguer, au jour de la vengeance, les élus d'avec les réprouvés.''&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as 6 January 1852, the future [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]], first President of the Republic, ordered all [[prefects of France|prefects]] to erase the triptych from all official documents and buildings, conflated with insurrection and disorder.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; [[Auguste Comte]] applauded Napoleon, claiming equality to be the "symbol of metaphysical anarchism", and preferring to it his diptych "''ordre et progrès''" ("order and progress", which would then become the motto of Brazil, [[Ordem e Progresso]]).&lt;ref name="historianet"&gt;{{Citation |trans-title=Flags &amp; meanings |url=http://www.historianet.com.br/conteudo/default.aspx?codigo=934 |title=Bandeiras e significados |newspaper=História net |accessdate=2010-10-09 |language=Portuguese}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Proudhon]] criticized fraternity as an empty word, which he associated with idealistic dreams of [[Romanticism]].&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; He preferred to it the sole term of liberty.

===Paris Commune and Third Republic===
Pache, mayor of the [[Paris Commune]], painted the formula "Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité, ou la mort" on the walls of the commune. It was only under the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] that the motto was made official. It was then not dissociated with insurrection and revolutionary ardours, [[Opportunist Republicans]] such as [[Jules Ferry]] or [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta]] adapting it to the new political conditions.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} [[Pierre Larousse|Larousse]]'s ''Dictionnaire universel'' deprived fraternity of its "evangelistic halo" (Mona Ozouf), conflating it with solidarity and the [[welfare state|welfare role]] of the state.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

Some still opposed the Republican motto, such as the nationalist [[Charles Maurras]] in his ''Dictionnaire politique et critique'', who claimed liberty to be an empty dream, equality an insanity, and only kept fraternity.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; [[Charles Péguy]], renewing with Lamennais' thought, kept fraternity and liberty, excluding equality, seen as an abstract repartition between individuals reduced to homogeneity,&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; opposing "fraternity" as a sentiment put in motion by "misery", while equality only interested itself, according to him, to the mathematical solution of the problem of "poverty."&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

Péguy identified Christian charity and socialist solidarity in this conception of fraternity.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt; On the other hand, [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]], the most important French author of [[scientific racism|pseudo-scientific racism]] and supporter of [[eugenism]], completely rejected the republican triptych, adopting another motto, "''déterminisme, inégalité, sélection''" (determinism, inequality, selection). But, according to Ozouf, the sole use of a triptych was the sign of the influence of the republican motto, despite it being corrupted in its opposite.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

==20th century==
During the [[German occupation of France in World War II]], this motto was replaced by the reactionary phrase "''[[travail, famille, patrie]]''" (work, family, fatherland)&lt;ref name="WHKLMA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Vichy Government |work=World History |place=[[Germany|DE]] |publisher=KMLA | url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/france/vichy.html |accessdate=2007-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Philippe Pétain|Marshal Pétain]], who became the leader of the new [[Vichy France|Vichy]] French government in 1940. Pétain had taken this motto from the [[colonel de la Rocque]]'s ''[[Parti social français]]'' (PSF), although the latter considered it more appropriate for a movement than for a regime.&lt;ref name=Ozouf /&gt;

Following the Liberation, the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] (GPRF) re-established the Republican motto ''Liberté, égalité, fraternité'', which is incorporated into both the 1946 and the 1958 French constitutions.&lt;ref name="FrEmb" /&gt;

==Other nations==
Many other nations have adopted the French slogan of "liberty, equality, and fraternity" as an ideal. These words appear in the [[Preamble to the Constitution of India|preamble]] to the [[Constitution of India]], enforced in 1950. Since its founding, "Liberty, Equality and Brotherhood" has been the lemma of the Social Democratic Party of Denmark. In the [[United Kingdom]] the political party the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] refer to "the fundamental values of liberty, equality and community" in the preamble of the party's Federal Constitution, and this is printed on party membership cards.&lt;ref name="LDFC"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Liberal Democrats |title=Federal Constitution |url=http://www.libdems.org.uk/constitution.aspx |place=[[United Kingdom|UK]] |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippine national flag has a rectangular design that
consists of a white equilateral triangle, symbolizing liberty,
equality, and fraternity; a horizontal blue stripe for peace,
truth, and justice; and a horizontal red stripe for patriotism
and valor . In the center of the white triangle is an eight-
rayed golden sun symbolizing unity, freedom, people's
democracy, and sovereignty.

The idea of the slogan "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity" has also given an influence as [[natural law]] to the First Article of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]:

{{quote|All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |chapter=Article 1 |title=The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Culture==
[[File:Liberte-egalite-fraternite-tympanum-church-saint-pancrace-aups-var.jpg|right|300px|thumb|[[Tympanum (architecture)|Tympanum]] of a state-owned [[Church (building)|church]]]]

At one point the motto was used to mark churches which were controlled by the state, rather than the Catholic Church.

Some former colonies of the French Republic (such as [[Haiti]], [[Chad]], [[Niger]], and [[Gabon]]) have adopted similar three-word mottos.

The terms are also referred to in the film trilogy [[Three Colors]] by [[Krzysztof Kieślowski]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13094">The '''loss of United Kingdom child benefit data''' was a [[data breach]] incident in October 2007, when two [[data storage device|computer discs]] owned by [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs]] containing data relating to [[child benefit]] went missing.  The incident was announced by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Alistair Darling]], on 20 November 2007.  The two discs contained the personal details of all families in the United Kingdom claiming [[child benefit]],&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Darling admits 25 million records lost|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7103566.stm|work=BBC|accessdate=2007-11-20 | date=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which takeup in the UK is near 100%.&lt;ref name="takeup"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pressure on Darling over records|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7104840.stm|work=BBC|accessdate=2007-11-22 | date=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The loss ==
The discs were sent by junior staff at [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs|HM Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC) based at Waterview Park in [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]], [[Tyne and Wear]], to the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] (NAO), as unrecorded internal mail via [[TNT N.V.|TNT]] on October 18. On October 24 the NAO complained to the HMRC that they had not received the data. On November 8, senior officials in HMRC were informed of the loss, with [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Alistair Darling]] being informed on November 10.&lt;ref name="bbc1"/&gt;  On November 20, Darling announced:
{{cquote|Two password-protected discs containing a full copy of HMRC's entire data in relation to the payment of child benefit was sent to the NAO by HMRC's internal post system operated by the courier TNT. The package was not recorded or registered.  It appears the data has failed to reach the address in the NAO.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;}}

The lost data was thought to concern approximately 25 million people in the UK (nearly half of the country's population). The personal data on the missing discs was reported to include names and addresses of parents and children and dates of birth of the children, together with the [[National Insurance]] numbers and bank or building society details of their parents.&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite news|title=UK's families put on fraud alert|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7103566.stm|work=BBC|accessdate=2007-11-20 | date=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "password protection" in question is that provided by [[WinZip]] version 8.&lt;ref name=RISKS_24.93&gt;{{cite web|title=HMRC Lost Discs &amp; Encryption|url=http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/24.93.html#subj14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a weak, proprietary scheme (unnamed encryption and [[hash function|hash]] algorithms) with well-known attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| accessdate=2008-02-05
| url=http://www.password-crackers.com/en/articles/12/
| title=Password Recovery/Cracking FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anyone competent in computing would be able to break this protection by downloading readily-available tools.  WinZip version 9 introduced [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] encryption, which would have been secure and only breakable by correctly knowing the [[passphrase]].

In a list of frequently asked questions,&lt;ref name="bbc2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Data disaster: Your queries answered|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7105592.stm|work=BBC|accessdate=2007-11-21 | date=2007-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the BBC News website a breakdown of the loss was reported as being:
* 7.25 million claimants
* 15.5 million children, including some who no longer qualify but whose family is claiming for a younger child
* 2.25 million 'alternative payees' such as partners or carers
* 3,000 'appointees' who claim the benefit under court instructions
* 12,500 agents who claim the benefit on behalf of a third party 

Whilst government ministers claimed that a junior official was to blame, the Conservatives said that the fault lay in part with senior management.  This was based on a claim that the National Audit Office had requested that bank details be removed from the data before it was sent, but that HMRC had denied this request, because it would be "too costly and complicated".&lt;ref name=bbc3&gt;{{cite news|title=Fresh questions over data crisis |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7106987.stm|work=BBC|accessdate=2007-11-22 | date=2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Emails released on 22 November confirmed that senior HMRC officials had been made aware of the decision on cost grounds not to strip out sensitive information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/nao_reports/07-08/child_benefit_data.pdf Email from HMRC to NAO], 13 March 2007. NAO website. Retrieved on 23 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of removing sensitive information has been given as [[pound sterling|£]]5,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=BHD1MPEHRMT3VQFIQMGSFFOAVCBQWIV0?xml=/news/2007/11/23/ncustoms223.xml £5,000 would have made HMRC discs safe], 23 November 2007. telegraph.co.uk. Retrieved on 25 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the cost was found to be substantially less (£650) in an academic study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.port.ac.uk/aboutus/newsandevents/frontpagenews/title,73969,en.html Removal of sensitive child benefit data would have cost £650], 19 December 2007. www.port.ac.uk. Retrieved on 20 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an IT [[trade journal]] ''[[Computer Weekly]]'', it said that back in March 2007, the NAO had asked for completed information of the child benefit database to be sent by post on CDs, instead of a sample of the database. The first time this was done, things went smoothly, and the package was registered post.  However this time, it was unregistered through the courier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2007/11/21/228217/missing-child-benefit-cds-what-went-wrong-and-why-it-would-have-carried-on.htm |title=Missing child benefit CDs: what went wrong, and why it would have carried on regardless|work=ComputerWeekly.com|accessdate=2007-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was later revealed on the 17 December 2007, that the data protection manual for HMRC was in itself under restriction to only senior members of staff, not junior civil servants who had just a summary of what the manual says on security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/12/17/hmrc_manual/ |title=HMRC manual on data protection was protected data |work=The Register |accessdate=2007-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other data scandals === 
This was followed by several other data scandals.  On the 17th of December, it was revealed by [[Ruth Kelly]] that the details of three million learner drivers were lost in the United States.  However the only details said to be lost were the: name, address, phone number, the fee paid, the test centre, payment code and [[e-mail]], so not much of a panic was caused due to a reduced risk of financial [[fraud]].  On the 23 December, it was revealed that nine [[National Health Service|NHS]] trusts had also lost the data of hundreds of thousands of patients, some of it archive information, some of it medical records, contact details and soft financial data.  A few other trusts also lost data, but found it fairly quickly.  Several other UK firms have also admitted security failings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title=Firms admit to two more cases of personal data loss
| date=2007-12-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response ==
Darling stated that there was no indication that the details had fallen into criminal hands, but he urged those affected to monitor their bank accounts.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; He said "If someone is the innocent victim of fraud as a result of this incident, people can be assured they have protection under the Banking Code so they will not suffer any financial loss as a result." HMRC then set up a Child Benefit Helpline for those concerned about the data loss.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt;

The incident was a breach of the UK's [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act]] and resulted in the resignation of HMRC chairman [[Paul Gray (civil servant)|Paul Gray]]; Darling commented that the discs were probably destroyed when "the hunt was on, probably within days" and that there was an "opaque" management structure at HMRS and it was difficult to see who was responsible for what.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book

 &lt;/ref&gt; Gray was subsequently found to be working at Cabinet Office.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/domestic_politics/paul+gray+back+at+work/1136847&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/economics/story/0,,2214109,00.html | title=Personal details of every child in UK lost by Revenue &amp; Customs | work=The Guardian | accessdate=2007-11-20 | location=London | first=Deborah | last=Summers | date=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Metropolitan Police]] and the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] both investigated the security breach, and uniformed police officers investigated HMRC offices. The loss led to much criticism by the Acting Leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] [[Vince Cable]] and [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer|Shadow Chancellor]] [[George Osborne]]. Osborne said:

{{cquote|Let us be clear about the scale of this catastrophic mistake{{mdash}} the names, the addresses and the dates of birth of every child in the country are sitting on two computer discs that are apparently lost in the post, and the bank account details and National Insurance numbers of ten million parents, guardians and carers have gone missing.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt;}}

In addition he said that it was the "final blow for the ambitions of this government to create a [[British national identity card|national ID database]]".  Cable also criticised the use of disks in the modern age of electronic data transfer.  Spokespersons for [[Gordon Brown]], however, said that the Prime Minister fully supported Darling, and said that Darling had not expressed any intention to resign.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt;

The general reaction of the public was one of anger and worry. Banks, individuals, businesses and government departments became more vigilant over data fraud and identity theft and the government pledged to be more careful with data. The public and media was particularly angry over the fact that the data was not registered or recorded, and that it was not securely encrypted.

Nick Assinder, a political correspondent at the [[BBC]], expressed the opinion that he believed Darling to be "on borrowed time".&lt;ref name=pol&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7104152.stm|title=Assessing the political damage, Darling and Brown|work=BBC|accessdate=2007-11-20 | date=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  George Osborne, who questioned whether Darling was "up to the job", suggested that it would be a matter of days before a decision was made regarding Darling's future.&lt;ref name=bbc4&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7104945.stm ''Ministers under fire over records''] [[BBC News]] retrieved November 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However Darling remained Chancellor until Labour's defeat in 2010. 

TNT stated that, as the delivery was not recorded, it would not be possible to even ascertain if it had actually been sent, let alone where it went.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30100-1293706,00.html CDs 'May Never Have Left The Building'][[Sky News]] - retrieved November 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jeremy Clarkson direct debit fraud ===

On 7 January 2008, [[Jeremy Clarkson]] found himself the subject of [[direct debit]] fraud after publishing his bank account and sort code details in his [[Column (newspaper)|column]] in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' to make the point that public concern over the scandal was unnecessary. He wrote, “All you'll be able to do with them is put money into my account. Not take it out. Honestly, I've never known such a palaver about nothing”. Someone then used these details to set up a £500 direct debit to the charity [[Diabetes UK]]. In his next ''[[Sunday Times]]'' column, Clarkson wrote, “I was wrong and I have been punished for my mistake.″ &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7174760.stm Clarkson stung after bank prank], [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the Direct Debit Guarantee, the payment could be reversed.

[[File:JOSE RAMON VALENTE.jpg|300px|thumb|José Ramón Valente, the current Minister of Economy, Development and Tourism.]]
The '''Ministry for the Economy, Development, and Tourism''' ({{lang-es|links=no|Ministerio de Economía, Fomento y Turismo de Chile}}) is a [[Chilean state ministry]] in charge of planning and executing the flow of policies and projects of the [[Chilean government]]. The ministry aims to generate feasible and sustainable economic development, with stable progressive equality in the allocation of economic interests. The current Minister of Economy, Development, and Tourism is José Ramón Valente Vias.
== History ==
The groundwork for the ministry were established in the 1930s—a period that saw the creation of the Subsecretary of Commerce that was dependent on the [[Ministry of Foreign Relations (Chile)|Ministry of Foreign Relations]] of that era. But the actual ministry itself was realized in October 1941 as Ministry of Commerce and Supply, and by 1942 it was ratified as the Ministry of Economy and Commerce. Subsequently, it was renamed to Ministry of Economy (1953&amp;ndash;1960), and hitherto the Ministry of Economy, Development, and Reconstruction.

== Structure ==

The Ministry for the Economy, Development, and Reconstruction is divided into three organizations headed by sub-secretaries:
*Economy Under-Secretariat
*Fisheries Under-Secretariat
*Tourism Under-Secretariat

Government organisations related to, dependent, or under supervision of the Ministry of Economy, Development, and Reconstruction include:
* [[Servicio Nacional de Pesca]] (SERNAPESCA)
* [[Servicio Nacional de Turismo]](SERNATUR)
* [[Servicio Nacional del Consumidor]] (SERNAC)
* [[Superintendencia de Electricidad y Combustibles]] (SEC)
* [[Millennium Science Initiative]]
* [[National Statistics Institute (Chile)|Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas de Chile]] (INE)
* [[Fiscalía Nacional Económica]] (FNE)
* [[Comité de Inversiones Extranjeras]]
* [[Empresa de Abastecimiento de Zonas Aisladas]] (EMAZA)
* [[Sistema de Empresas Públicas]] (SEP)
* [[Corporación de Fomento de la Producción]] (CORFO)
* [[Comité de Inversiones Extranjeras]] CINVER

[[File:Flag of Italian Committee of National Liberation.svg|thumb|250px|Flag of the CLN.]]
The '''National Liberation Committee''' ({{lang-it|Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale}}, CLN) was a political [[umbrella organization]] and the main representative of the [[Italian resistance movement]] fighting against the German occupation of [[Italy]] in the aftermath of the [[armistice of Cassibile]]. It was a multi-party entity, whose members were united by their [[anti-fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anpi.it/storia/140/comitato-di-liberazione-nazionale-cln Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale – CLN]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The CLN was formed on 9 September 1943, following Italy's surrender to the Allies and [[Operation Achse|Germany's invasion of the country]]. The member parties were the [[Italian Communist Party]], the [[Italian Socialist Party]], the [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]], [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]], the [[Labour Democratic Party]], and the [[Italian Liberal Party]]. With the backing of the [[Kingdom of Italy|Royal government]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]], CLN gained official recognition as the representative of the Italian resistance movement, and had several leaders operating underground in German-occupied Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anpi-lissone.over-blog.com/article-36017665.html La formazione del CLNAI (Comitato di liberazione nazionale Alta Italia)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The partisan formations controlled by the CLN were primarily divided between three main groups, [[Communist]] [[Garibaldi Battalion|Garibaldi Brigades]], the Action Party's [[Giustizia e Libertà|Justice and Freedom]] Brigades, and [[Socialist]] "[[Giacomo Matteotti|Matteotti]]" Brigades. Smaller groups included [[Catholic]] and [[monarchism|monarchist]] partisans. There were partisan units not represented in the CLN, including the ''Brigata Maiella'' and [[anarchist]], [[Republicanism|republican]] and [[Trotskyist]] formations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/cultura/25-aprile-1945-festa-liberazione-milano/cards/cln-spiegato-bene-che-cosa-era-comitato-liberazione-nazionale/cln-spiegato-90-secondi_principale.shtml Il Cln, spiegato bene: che cosa era il Comitato di Liberazione nazionale]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CLN led the governments of Italy from the [[liberation of Rome]] in June 1944 until the [[Italian general election, 1946|first post-war general election in 1946]].

[[File:Ambtenaar Louis Dusée Zwaansteeg Utrecht v2.jpg|thumb|right|''Ambtenaar'' ("Government official"), by Louis Dusée, [[Utrecht]], 1961]]
An '''official''' is someone who holds an office (function or [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]], regardless whether it carries an actual [[Office|working space]] with it) in an [[organization]] or [[government]] and participates in the exercise of [[authority]] (either their own or that of their superior and/or employer, public or legally private).

A '''government official''' or '''functionary''' is an official who is involved in [[public administration]] or government, through either [[election]], appointment, selection, or [[employment]]. A [[bureaucrat]] or [[civil servant]] is a member of the [[bureaucracy]]. An '''elected official''' is a person who is an official by virtue of an election. Officials may also be appointed ''[[ex officio]]'' (by virtue of another office, often in a specified capacity, such as presiding, advisory, secretary). Some official positions may be [[Inheritance|inherited]]. A person who currently holds an office is referred to as an [[incumbent]].

The word ''official'' as a [[noun]] has been recorded since the [[Middle English]] period, first seen in 1314.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} It comes from the [[Old French]] ''official'' (12th century), from the [[Latin]] ''officialis'' ("attendant to a magistrate, public official"), the noun use of the original [[adjective]] ''officialis'' ("of or belonging to duty, service, or office") from ''officium'' ("office"). The meaning "person in charge of some public work or duty" was first recorded in 1555. The adjective is first attested in English in 1533 via the Old French ''{{lang|fr|oficial}}''.

The informal term ''officialese'', the [[jargon]] of "officialdom", was first recorded in 1884.

==Roman antiquity==
An ''officialis'' ([[plural]] ''officiales'') was the official term (somewhat comparable to a modern civil servant) for any member of the [[Officium (Ancient Rome)|officium]] (staff) of a high dignitary such as a governor.

==Ecclesiastical judiciary==
{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar}}
{{Canon Law}}In [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]], the word or its Latin original '''''officialis''''' is used absolutely as the legal title of a diocesan bishop's [[judicial vicar]] who shares the bishop's [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] judicial power over the diocese and presides over the diocesan [[ecclesiastical court]].

The 1983 Code of Canon Law gives precedence to the title [[Judicial Vicar]], rather than that of Officialis (canon 1420). The Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches uses only the title Judicial Vicar (canon 191).

In German, the related noun ''Offizialat'' was also used for an official bureau in a diocese that did much of its administration, comprising the [[vicar general|vicariate-general]], an adjoined secretariat, a registry office and a chancery.

In Catholicism, the vicar-general was originally called the "official" (''officialis'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Diocese |volume= |first=Alphonse |last=van Hove}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of '''official principal''', together with that of [[vicar-general]], has in Anglicanism been merged in that of [[Diocesan chancellor]] of a diocese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Official |volume=20 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==
In [[sports]], the term official is used to describe a person enforcing playing [[wiktionary:rule|rules]] in the capacity of a [[Assistant referee (association football)|linesman]], [[referee]] and [[umpire]]; also specified by the discipline, e.g. [[American football official]], [[ice hockey official]].

The term ''officer'' is close to being a synonym (but has more military [[connotation]]s). A '''functionary''' is someone who carries out a particular role within an organization; this again is quite a close synonym for '''''official''''', as a [[noun]], but with connotations closer to [[bureaucrat]]. Any such person acts in their '''official capacity''', in carrying out the duties of their office; they are also said to '''officiate''', for example in a [[ceremony]]. A '''public official''' is an official of central or local [[government]].

==Max Weber on bureaucratic officials==
{{unsourced-section|date=June 2017}}
[[Max Weber]] gave as definition of a bureaucratic official:
*they are personally free and appointed to their position on the basis of conduct
*he exercises the authority delegated to them in accordance with impersonal rules, and their loyalty is enlisted on behalf of the faithful execution of their official duties
*their appointment and job placement are dependent upon their technical qualifications
*their administrative work is a full-time occupation
*their work is rewarded by a regular salary and prospects of advancement in a lifetime career.

An official must exercise their judgment and their skills, but their duty is to place these at the service of a higher authority; ultimately they are responsible only for the impartial execution of assigned tasks and must sacrifice their personal judgment if it runs counter to their official duties.

==Adjective==
As an [[adjective]], "official" often, but not always, means pertaining to the government, as state employee or having state recognition, or analogous to governance or to a formal (especially legally regulated) proceeding as opposed to informal business. Some examples:
*An ''official holiday'' is a [[public holiday]], having national (or regional) recognition. 
*An [[official language]] is a language recognised by a government, for its own use in administration, or for delivering services to its citizens (for example, on [[signpost]]s). 
*An ''official spokesperson'' is an individual empowered to speak for the government, or some part of it such as a [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]], on a range of issues and on the record for the [[Mass media|media]]. 
*An ''official statement'' is an issued by an organisation as an expression of its corporate position or opinion;{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} an ''official apology'' is an apology similarly issued by an organisation (as opposed to an apology by an individual).{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} 
*''Official policy'' is policy publicly acknowledged and defended by an organisation.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} In these cases ''unofficial'' is an antonym, and variously may mean informal, unrecognised, personal or unacknowledged. 
*An ''official strike'' is a [[Strike action|strike]] organised and recognised by a [[labour union]], as opposed to an ''unofficial strike'' at grassroots level.
*An ''official school'' is a [[school]] administered by the government or by a local authority, as opposite to a [[private school]] or [[Parochial school|religious school]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
*An ''[[official history]]'', for example of an institution or business, or particularly of a [[war]] or [[military unit]], is a history written as a commission, with the assumption of co-operation with access to records and archives; but without necessarily full [[editorial independence]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
*An ''official biography'' is usually on the same lines, written with access to private papers and the support of the family of the subject.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

'''Open Communities '''(formerly '''Interfaith Housing Center of the Northern Suburbs''') is a nonprofit organization that advocates for fair and affordable housing in 17 northern suburbs of [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;http://open-communities.org/#serve&lt;/ref&gt; Open Communities' mission is to educate, advocate and organize to promote just and inclusive communities in north suburban Chicago. Open Communities works with current and prospective residents and local groups to promote economically and culturally diverse communities. Free services include fair and affordable housing counseling services, community education, advocacy, and organizing for welcoming communities.

== History==
Open Communities has its roots in the [[African-American civil rights movement (1954–1968)|civil rights movement]] of the 1960s. A group of young mothers in [[Wilmette]] were worried that their children were growing up in a community that lacked diversity, and they began to discuss how they could organize for change. There were no [[Fair Housing Act|fair housing laws]] at that time, and housing discrimination was common. But although local housing ads often stipulated, "No [[Negro|Negroes]], [[Asian people|Orientals]] or [[Jews]]," the women, joined by local clergy, believed that many community members shared their concerns about [[housing discrimination]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://open-communities.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, a fair housing conference organized by local clergy in 1972 resulted in the creation of the North Shore Interfaith Housing Council,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairhousing.com/index.cfm?method=page.display&amp;pageid=3659&lt;/ref&gt; which became the North Suburban Housing Center in 1977, then Interfaith Housing Center of the Northern Suburbs in 1986, and Open Communities in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://open-communities.org/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service Programs ==

===Fair housing and discrimination complaints===

Open Communities helps individuals who report illegal housing discrimination, predominantly the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], which makes denying housing to anyone on the basis of their race, color, national origin illegal. Additionally, the law protects those with disabilities, as well as families with children.  Open Communities is an operating member of the National Fair Housing Alliance.

In addition to pursuing individual cases, Open Communities works to settle cases for building that systemically discriminate against seniors or people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-evanston-apartment-disability-lawsuit-0216-biz-20160215-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cookcountyrecord.com/stories/510647938-fair-housing-advocacy-groups-score-settlement-with-ryan-companies-over-senior-apartments&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homesharing program===
The [[Homeshare|Homesharing]] program is a free service which matches renters with residents in need of additional income, or who desire assistance with housekeeping chores. It often benefits residents at risk of foreclosure as well as the elderly and individuals with disabilities. The program has been lauded by the Retirement Research Foundation, and has received positive press in Chicago's northern suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = North Shore organization plays affordable housing matchmaker|url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/winnetka/ct-open-communities-homesharing-tl-20140906-story.html|accessdate = 2015-06-11|first = Chicago|last = Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June, 2015, the program had facilitated over 700 matches in the North Shore and Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Homesharing|url = http://www.open-communities.org/programs/Homesharing/|website = www.open-communities.org|accessdate = 2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landlord-Tenant Advice===
Both landlords and tenants have rights and responsibilities toward one another, their neighbors and their homes. Landlords’ and tenants’ rights are protected under state and local laws, which establish requirements about security deposits, heating, property maintenance, entry, and eviction.&lt;ref&gt;http://open-communities.org/landlord-tenant-advice/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Housing Counseling and Foreclosure Prevention===
The foreclosure crisis is one of the nation’s most pressing housing issues, and [[Illinois]] continues to have one of the highest rates of foreclosure fillings. The crisis has been particularly hard on immigrants, people of color, and lower-income families who became north suburban homeowners in the last two decades.
More than 14,500 homes were foreclosed in Chicago’s northern suburbs between 2005 and 2013, according to an Open Communities’ analysis of Woodstock Institute foreclosure filings data.&lt;ref&gt;http://open-communities.org/foreclosure-prevention/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy and Community Organizing ==
At Open Communities, we were founded on the belief that making housing available to people of all incomes and backgrounds makes the northern suburbs a better place to live. That’s why we collaborate with and build local and regional coalitions to advance fair and affordable housing programs, policies and legislation, and provide support for bricks-and-mortar housing developments that meet a wide range of local needs.&lt;ref&gt;http://open-communities.org/advocacy/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Open Communities joined the #Fightfor15.&lt;ref&gt;http://progressillinois.com/quick-hits/content/2016/05/02/fight-15-takes-battle-living-wage-chicago-suburbs&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Justice Project ===
Launched in 2015 to not only commemorate Dr. King's visit to [[Winnetka, Illinois|Winnetka]] in 1965, but to challenge our community to become even more welcoming, The Justice Project: The March Continues is a grassroots social justice movement to inspire the communities in the northern suburbs of Chicago and beyond to be welcoming, inclusive and diverse, and to offer them a framework for doing so.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justiceprojectcontinues.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== #StandWithMuslims ===
Dozens of community groups, led by Open Communities and Jewish Voice for Peace, stand against the many ways in which anti-[[Muslim]] and [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] hatred manifests itself, including hate speech and hate crimes; institutionalized racism and state-sanctioned violence; racial and religious profiling in all its forms; and prejudice that targets refugees and immigrants of all backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;http://chicagomonitor.com/2016/03/multiple-faith-based-groups-rally-in-evanston-against-islamophobia/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Peace Museum, Bradford''' is the only museum dedicated to the history and (often untold) stories of peace, peacemakers and peace movements, in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/15155635.New_interactive_map_shows_access_to_district__39_s_museums/|title=New interactive map shows access to district's museums|work=Telegraph and Argus|date=14 March 2017|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Peace Museum aims to engage, inform and inspire through: items in its collection and exhibitions of learning and education activities for all sectors of the community, schools, colleges and universities, focusing on local, national and international people, events and stories posing questions about equality, diversity, cohesion, peace and non-violence
telling stories of peacemakers and peacemaking.{{sfn|Aspel|2017|pp=61&amp;ndash;64}}

The museum asks visitors to consider peace and peacemaking as an active, as opposed to passive endeavour, a challenge and something that requires effort, asking "What could you do?" What story will you tell".{{sfn|Aspel|2017|p=62}}

The initial idea of creating a peace museum arose in the mid–1980s from Gerald Drewett of the Give Peace a Chance Trust. In 1990 this was carried forward when Shireen Shah, an MA student at [[University of Bradford|Bradford University]]’s [[Department of Peace Studies, University of Bradford|Peace Studies Department]], wrote a dissertation proposing a ‘Museum for Peace’.&lt;ref name="Tel9oct2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/lists/Monuments-to-peace-10-places-to-make-love-not-war/|title=Monuments to peace: 10 places to make love not war|work=The Telegraph|date=9 October 2015|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years on, the International Network of Museums for Peace held its first conference at the University of Bradford in 1992, during which it was proposed that a Peace Museum be established in Bradford. A committee was established to seek finance and general support for the idea. Initially called ‘The National Peace Museum Project’, the Museum was established in 1994 through a five-year grant from the [[Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust|Joseph Rowntree Charitable Foundation]] and operated from a temporary site in Bradford in the [[Wool Exchange, Bradford|Wool Exchange]]. In 1998 the Museum moved to its present site on the top floor of 10 Piece Hall Yard, in Bradford city centre.

The Museum has a varied temporary exhibition programme, hosting several exhibitions and displays throughout the year. Past exhibitions have ranged from 'Challenging the Fabric of Society' showcasing the protest banners that are part of its textile collection (until March 2017),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/14882632.Banners_from_high_profile_protests_now_on_display_at_Bradford_museum/|title=Banners from high profile protests now on display at Bradford museum|work=Telegraph and Argus|date=11 November 2016|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Remembering the Kindertransport' to commemorate Holocaust Memorial Day (until April 2017) and 'A force for peace? The History of European Cooperation' (ended 2016) exploring the peace history behind the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/14478557.Should_we_stay_or_Leave__EU_will_be_focus_of_new_exhibition_in_Bradford_as_referendum_approaches/|title=European Union will be focus of new exhibition at Bradford Peace Museum|work=Telegraph and Argus|date=8 May 2016|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poundage quotas]] were authorized by the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938]], so the '''peanut poundage quota''' was the supply control mechanism for the [[peanut price support program]] until its revision in the [[2002 farm bill]] (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 1301-1310).

The [[1996 farm bill]] (P.L. 104-127) required that (for the 1996-2002 crops) the [[poundage quota]] be set equal to projected food demand and related uses. The national quota was allocated among states based on historical shares, and then divided among farms based on production history. Owners (via inheritance or purchase) of quota were allowed to sell peanuts produced against their quota, or sell, lease and transfer their quota to other producers. Peanuts marketed above the quota limits (called additional peanuts) had to be crushed for non-edible uses or exported.

The [[2002 farm bill]] eliminated peanut quotas and the [[two-tiered pricing]] structure and replaced this with a support program comparable to that for so-called [[covered commodities]] -- such as wheat, feedgrains, cotton, and rice—as well as with buy-out funding.

The '''Primera Junta''' or '''First Assembly''' is the most common name given to the first independent government of [[United Provinces of the Río de la Plata|Argentina]]. It was created on 25 May 1810, as a result of the events of the [[May Revolution]]. The Junta initially had representatives from only Buenos Aires. When it was expanded, as expected, with the addition of the representatives from the other cities of the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]], it became popularly known instead as the '''[[Junta Grande]]''' (''Grand Council''). The Junta operated at ''El Fuerte'' (''the fort'', where the modern [[Casa Rosada]] stands), which had been used since 1776 as a residence by the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Viceroys]].

==Creation==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2012}}
{{Main|May Revolution}}
This Junta—officially named the ''Junta Provisional Gubernativa de las Provincias del Río de la Plata a nombre del Señor Don Fernando VII'' (Provisional Governing Junta of the Provinces of Río de la Plata in the Name of Señor [[Don (honorific)|Don]] [[Ferdinand VII]])—allegedly meant to govern in the name of the King of Spain, while he was imprisoned by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Juntas]] were a form of transitional or emergency government, which attempted to maintain Spanish sovereignty, that emerged during the [[Peninsular War|Napoleonic invasion]] in Spanish cities that had not succumbed to the French. The most important for Spanish America was the [[Junta of Seville]], which claimed sovereignty over the overseas possessions, given the fact that the [[Seville (province)|province of Seville]] historically had enjoyed exclusive rights to the [[Spanish treasure fleet|American trade]]. Its claims had been rejected by Spanish Americans, and its authority was quickly superseded by a [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Supreme Central Junta]] of Spain, which included American representation.

When the Supreme Central Junta abolished itself in 1810, the politically active inhabitants of Buenos Aires saw no better moment than this to establish a local government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had been influenced by the recent democratic and republican [[Age of Enlightenment|philosophical wave]], and were also concerned about the commercial monopoly exerted by the Spanish crown, which was suffocating the local economy. Historically Buenos Aires province had partially mitigated this problem through contraband. Local politicians, such as former council member and legal advisor to the viceroy, Juan José Castelli, who wanted a change towards self-government and free commerce, cited traditional [[School of Salamanca|Spanish political theory]] and argued that the King being imprisoned, sovereignty had returned to the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Si el derecho de conquista pertenece, por origen, al país conquistador, justo sería que la España comenzase por darle la razón al reverendo obispo abandonando la resistencia que hace a los franceses y sometiéndose, por los mismos principios con que se pretende que los americanos se sometan a las aldeas de Pontevedra. La razón y la regla tienen que ser iguales para todos. Aquí no hay conquistados ni conquistadores, aquí no hay sino españoles. Los españoles de España han perdido su tierra. Los españoles de América tratan de salvar la suya. Los de España que se entiendan allá como puedan y que no se preocupen, los americanos sabemos lo que queremos y adónde vamos. Por lo tanto propongo que se vote: que se subrogue otra autoridad a la del virrey que dependerá de la metrópoli si ésta se salva de los franceses, que será independiente si España queda subyugada.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people were to assume the government until the King returned, just as the subjects in Spain had done two years earlier with the establishment of juntas. The Viceroy and his supporters countered that the colonies belonged to Spain and did not have a political relationship with only the King.  Therefore, they should follow any governmental body established in Spain as the legal authority, namely the Supreme Central Junta of Spain and its successor, the Council of Regency.

The meeting of a Buenos Aires ''[[cabildo abierto]]'' (an extraordinary meeting of the municipal council with assistance of over 200 notables from government, the church, guilds and other corporations) during 22 May 1810, came under strong pressure from the militias and a crowd that formed in front of the ''cabildo'' hall on the Plaza Mayor (today the [[Plaza de Mayo]]), up to 25 May. The crowd favored the stance of the local politicians, and the ''cabildo'' ended up creating the Primera Junta, the first form of local government in the territory that would later become Argentina. Spain would never recover its dominion over that territory. From the very beginning of the new government, two factions manifested their differences, a more radical one, whose visible leader was the Junta's Secretary, Mariano Moreno, and the conservative wing that supported the Junta's President, Cornelio Saavedra.

In general the principles of the May Revolution were popular sovereignty, the principle of representation and federalization, division of powers, the maintenance of the mandates, and publication of the government's actions

== Duration and Transformation ==
[[File:Mariano Moreno en su mesa de trabajo.jpg|thumb|[[Mariano Moreno]], Secretary of War, was one of the most important members of the Primera Junta.]]
Despite the replacement of Cisneros, the Royal Audience and the Cabildo stood with the authorities that existed before the revolution, who opposed the Junta since its first day. The Audience refused at first to swear allegiance to the Junta, and when they finally did, prosecutor Caspe did so with clear gestures of contempt. Caspe would be later ambushed near his home, in retaliation for this.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, Norberto, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; The Cabildo imposed a time limit on the Junta: if the General Congress was not formed in six months, the Cabildo would reassume government. The Junta answered the same day, rejecting such requirements. The Audience then requested that the Junta submitted to the Regency Counsel, but the Junta refused, on the grounds that Cisneros did not so submit and the Audience did not request him to. The Audience itself swore allegiance to the Counsel shortly after, and they were all banished in response. Together with the ex-viceroy Cisneros, they were forced to take the ship ''Dart'' that left them at the Canary Islands; the exceptions were Márquez del Plata, who was at the Banda Oriental at the time, and the octogenarian Lucas Muñoz Cubero.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, Norberto, pp. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early days of the Primera Junta there was a strong rivalry between Saavedra and Moreno. According to Ignacio Núñez, the Morenists accused Saavedra of plotting to restore the tyranny of the viceroys in his office, while the Saavedrists accused Moreno of usurping government roles that were not intended for him.&lt;ref name="pag doce"&gt;Galasso, Norberto, pp. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Matheu would also point in his memories that the Morenists were upset because they perceived that Saavedra enjoyed receiving honors and distinctions that they had chosen to avoid.&lt;ref name="pag doce"/&gt;

The Junta was received with mixed reactions from the other cities of the viceroyalty. Santa Fe, Entre Ríos, Misiones, Corrientes and Mendoza supported the change, others did not. Upper Peru, which greatly benefited from the system of [[Mit'a|mita]] to exploit the mines in Potosi, supported the absolutist system for a long time. Javier De Elío in Montevideo denied recognition to the Junta. Paraguay was torn between supporters of either side, but royalists prevailed. However, the most immediate danger to the Junta came from Cordoba, where Santiago de Liniers came out of his retirement and started to organize an army to lead a [[Liniers Counter-revolution|counter-revolution]] against Buenos Aires. The Junta ordered Ortiz de Ocampo to stand against those counter-revolutionaries and bring the leaders as prisoners to Buenos Aires. A later ruling requested instead to execute them, but after defeating Liniers, Ortiz de Ocampo decided to ignore the latter and instead to follow the first ruling. The Junta removed Ocampo from his duty for this act of disobedience, and replaced him with Juan José Castelli. Castelli ordered the execution of the counter-revolutionaries by August, 26, with the exception of the priest Orellana. By this time, Mariano Moreno was popularly regarded as the leader of the revolution, whose resolution permitted the radical changes to the absolutist system that the Junta had managed so far.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, Norberto, pp. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

There's some controversy among historians about the authenticity of the [[Operations plan]], a secret document attributed to Mariano Moreno, that set a harsh [[government policy]] in the fields of economics, politics and international relations.

Military authorities, fearing the loss of power by Saavedra, pressured the Junta to control Moreno. Moreno, on the other hand, succeeded in getting the approval of decrees that limited Saavedra and others. By December 1810 tension had reached its peak. Saavedra got the support of deputies sent by the interior provinces that had not yet been allowed to join the Junta. With this backing, Saavedra gave Moreno his most serious political setback: he forced Moreno to present his resignation on 18 December. With this resignation, the integration of the deputies from the other provinces to the Junta became possible.

Created on 25 May 1810, the Primera Junta was thus transformed on 18 December of the same year into the new [[Junta Grande]] by the introduction of representatives from other provinces of Río de la Plata.

==Foreign policy==
The Primera Junta was concerned with the risk of Portuguese expansionism towards La Plata, either directly or through the [[Carlotism|Carlotist]] project. The diplomacy in Spain attempted to prevent the dispatch of a punitive army, limiting the armed conflicts to the royalists in Paraguay, the Upper Peru and the Banda Oriental. The Junta declared itself a natural ally of any city that revolts against the royalists; either those that did so in support of the May Revolution or those who revolted on their own (Chile, and Paraguay shortly after Belgrano's defeat).&lt;ref name="Santillan571"&gt;Abad de Santillán, p. 571&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain, allied with Spain in the Napoleonic Wars, stayed neutral in the conflicts between patriots and royalists. Nevertheless, the British policy towards the conflict was to favour British trade as long as it did not conflict with the neutral policy.&lt;ref name="Santillan571"/&gt;

Created in response to the [[9/11|September 11, 2001 attacks]],&lt;ref name="loep" /&gt; subdivisions of the project named ''A-O Canada'' and ''C-O Canada'' were based in Ottawa and Montreal, RCMP Divisions A and C respectively.&lt;ref name="loep"&gt;[[Arar Commission]], [http://www.maherarar.ca/the%20inquiry%20today%20more.php?id=111_0_19_0_M Testimony of] [[Garry Loeppky]]&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2001, the RCMP was shifting its focus from gathering intelligence, to seeking information "in a manner suitable for court purposes".&lt;ref name="bid" /&gt;

It was later criticised for bringing together forty members from the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]'s (RCMP) ''Commercial Crimes'', ''IPOC'', and ''National Security Investigations'' branches, [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] (CSIS), [[Canada Customs and Revenue Agency|Customs and Revenue Agency]], [[Canada Border Services Agency]], the Quebec and Ontario provincial police, and local officers from Hull, Gatineau and Ottawa. The team was composed almost entirely of individuals with no knowledge of [[intelligence gathering]], Islam, or human rights issues, and was simply told to cooperate fully with the American [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency]], turning over all information without hesitation.&lt;ref name="kerry"/&gt;

The project was ultimately found to have played a "central role"&lt;ref name="ruling" /&gt; in the wrongful rendition and torture of Canadian citizens, including [[Maher Arar]], who was tortured for ten months before being found innocent of the officers' claims that he was "suspected of being linked to the Al Qaeda terrorist movement".&lt;ref name="house" /&gt;

[[Ottawa Citizen]], "[http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=282604a0-659a-48f0-9465-4bf832982482 RCMP 9/11 dragnet targeted eldest Khadr]", December 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

They also investigated claims from local residents that a man who resembled [[Mohamed Atta]] had worked part-time at the ''Best Copy'' [[photocopying|copy shop]] in downtown Toronto, seizing the store's records and investigating its customers, adding a number of them to an [[Interpol]] database.&lt;ref name="god" /&gt;

By October, the RCMP claimed to have identified 10-12 "al-Qaida suspects" in the city,&lt;ref name="god"&gt;Godfrey, Tom. [[Toronto Sun]], "Al-Qaida search heats up", October 21, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and a month later reported they had "undertaken 24-hour surveillance of at least five suspected supporters of [[Osama bin Laden]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[CBC.ca|CBC]], [http://www.cbc.ca/newsinreview/nov2001/PDFs/canada.pdf Terrorist Attack: Protecting Canada], November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion of the project==
{{rquote|right|The priorities that everybody had been assigned to, or working on, prior to 9/11, were basically put on the shelf and everybody was redirected to try and address the threat and the crisis that was ongoing with respect to terrorist attacks.|Supt. Mike Cabana&lt;ref name="kerry"&gt;Pither, Kerry. "Dark Days: The Story of Four Canadians Tortured in the Name of Fighting Terror", 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In October 2001, the RCMP's Toronto office met with Ottawa officers in [[Newmarket, Ontario]] and requested they form a ''Project A-O'' division.&lt;ref name="bid" /&gt; Its first task was to help Toronto by taking over the investigation of the electronics store owner [[Abdullah Almalki]], who had worked for [[Human Concern International]] at the same time as Khadr.&lt;ref name="drag" /&gt; Almalki had been under surveillance by the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] since he first met with Khadr in 1998.&lt;ref name="Person of Interest"&gt;{{cite news|first=Don|last=Butler|title=The Arar Chronicles: Person of Interest (Part 1)|publisher=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=2006-12-08|page=A4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Project C-O'' meanwhile put Abdelrahman, the younger brother of [[Mohamad Elzahabi]] working as a mechanic in Montreal, "under a microscope".&lt;ref name="colin"&gt;Freze, Colin. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/jailed-arab-details-ties-to-tortured-canadians/article1285350/ Jailed Arab details ties to tortured Canadians], September 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ontario Provincial Police]] officers were also tasked to help the Federal police agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iacobucciinquiry.ca/pdfs/documents/2007-12-14-OPP-Submissions-Standards-of-Conduct.pdf Internal Inquiry into the Actions of Canadian Officials in Relation to Abdullah Almalki, Ahmad Abou-Elmaati and Muayyed Nureddin]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actions==
The Ottawa office, under the control of Cpl. Randal Walsh,&lt;ref name="bid" /&gt; Garry Clement&lt;ref&gt;MacLeon, Ian. [[CanWest]], "Former Mountie defends embattled Arar investigation", September 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and Supt. Mike Cabana,&lt;ref name="ctv" /&gt; quickly moved from providing assistance to their Toronto colleagues, and began conducting their own investigations focusing primarily on [[Abdullah Almalki]] and [[Ahmad Abou El Maati]].&lt;ref name="loep"/&gt; 
[[File:Mango Cafe Ottawa.png|thumb|320px|The Mango Cafe]]
When Almalki met with telecommunications engineer [[Maher Arar]] at the ''Mango Cafe'' [[shawarma]] restaurant in Ottawa to discuss local doctors and [[ink cartridge|printer cartridge]]s, officers clandestinely acquired his 1997 lease agreement from [[Minto Developments Inc.]],&lt;ref name="loep"/&gt; and saw that he had listed Almalki as an emergency contact. He was subsequently placed under surveillance by ''Project A-O'',&lt;ref name="bid"&gt;[[Michelle Shephard|Shephard, Michelle]], [[Toronto Star]], "Canadian loses bid to sue Jordan", March 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="drag" /&gt; and his name added to a Canada Customs "terrorist lookout list", although it was later determined there was no evidence to support such an action.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;Austen, Ian. [[New York Times]], "[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/19/world/americas/19canada.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin Canadians Fault US for Its Role in Torture Case], September 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2002, Cpl. Randy Walsh received [[search warrant]]s to raid seven homes, although later analysis suggested that if he had been honest about their evidence before the judge, the warrants would not have been granted.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Don. [[Ottawa Citizen]], "RCMP used 'disturbing' tactics to get warrants; Didn't tell judges information came from Syrian agents", August 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A [[publication ban]] initially prevented the media from reporting the identities of those targeted, although later reports confirmed which buildings had been searched.&lt;ref name="drag" /&gt; 

*The Ottawa home of [[Abdullah Almalki]]&lt;ref name="drag" /&gt;
*The Ottawa home of Almalki's sales manager at work&lt;ref name="kerry"/&gt;
*The Ottawa home of Almalki's brother [[Nazih Almalki|Nazih]]&lt;ref name="drag" /&gt;
*The Toronto home of [[Ahmed Khadr]], although he hadn't been home to Canada in more than a year&lt;ref name="drag" /&gt;
*The Toronto home of [[Ahmad Abou El-Maati|Ahmad El-Maati]], who was already in a Syrian prison&lt;ref name="drag" /&gt;
*The Montreal home of [[Mohamad Elzahabi]]'s brother Abdelrahman&lt;ref name="letgo"&gt;Freeze, Colin. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', "Torture, radios and why the US won't let go", March 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Montreal home and business of Ibrahym Adam, the mechanic who gave el-Maati a job.&lt;ref name="kerry"/&gt;

In addition, while they lacked a warrant to search his house, officers visited Arar to discover he was overseas. When he returned, he agreed to discussions with a lawyer present, but the RCMP found the requirement too "stringent" and did not follow up.&lt;ref name="bid" /&gt;

In April 2002, ''Project A-O'' sent American officials their complete files without any limits on its use or "regard for the rights of citizens",&lt;ref&gt;[[International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group]], [http://www.interpares.ca/en/publications/pdf/ICMLG-Arar-Closing_submission.pdf Submission to the Factual Inquiry], September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; leading to tension between RCMP headquarters and the anti-terrorism project.&lt;ref name="ctv" /&gt; The Americans later used faxes detailing the sale of [[walkie talkies]] seized at Almalki's house in the raid as evidence in their trial against [[Mohamad Elzahabi]].&lt;ref name="linked"&gt;Duffy, Andrew. [[Ottawa Citizen]], [http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=23d73fb7-9eb4-484c-a128-bcf5504da203 Almalki linked to US terror trial] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104084938/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=23d73fb7-9eb4-484c-a128-bcf5504da203 |date=2012-11-04 }}, March 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, after Almalki was arrested in Syria - ''Project A-O'' officers wanted to send Syria information about him, as well as a list of questions that they wanted him to answer, stating that "Depending on his willingness to answer truthfully and depending on the answers he provides you, a second series of questions has been prepared for him".&lt;ref name="tie" /&gt; Sgt. Rick Flewelling, from the RCMP headquarters, intervened and insisted that the Department of Justice and Foreign Affairs would have to be involved &lt;ref name="ctv"&gt;[[CTV Television Network|CTV]], "[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1124760253925_469450/?hub=Canada RCMP intelligence sharing probed at Arar inquiry]", August 23, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tie"&gt;Freeze, Colin. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', "Documents tie Khadr to tortured pair", November 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2002, the A-O division began asking the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade]] (DFAIT) to help them secure the ability to travel to Syria to interrogate Almalki themselves, or at least direct how he would be interrogated by Syrians. When DFAIT officer Jonathan Solomon demanded to know whether they would be clear not to use torture, since it had already been used against Ahmed el-Maati, A-O Division officers "got awkward" and Cabana claimed that it was possible that el-Maati had just been lying about Syria using torture.&lt;ref name="kerry"/&gt; Also in September, as Arar was en route to New York from Switzerland, ''Project A-O'' officers faxed a memo to Americans which involved a number of "false claims" about Arar, stating that he and his wife were "Islamic
Extremist individuals suspected of being linked to the Al Qaeda
terrorist movement".&lt;ref name="house"&gt;House of Commons, Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security,

The project also sent officers to Pakistan in 2005, after it was announced that Khadr's son [[Abdullah Khadr|Abdullah]] had been arrested. Abdullah stated that when he was about 14 years old, his father had purchased two pairs of [[walkie talkies]] from Almalki, although his lawyers later argued the statement had been made due to his mistreatment by Pakistani officials.&lt;ref name="tie" /&gt;

==Fallout==
After it was discovered that Canadian authorities had been complicit in the rendition and torture of an innocent Canadian, a [[Royal Commission]] was formed to investigate. ''Project A-O'' figured prominently in the explanation of Canada's anti-terrorism investigations, while attorney Don Bayne unsuccessfully argued that since the RCMP couldn't disclose ''full'' information due to national security concerns, it therefore shouldn't have to disclose ''any'' information about the project.&lt;ref name="ruling"&gt;[[Dennis O'Connor (judge)|O'Connor, Dennis]]. [[Arar Commission]], [http://www.ararcommission.ca/eng/Ruling_RCMP_0512.pdf Ruling on RCMP testimony] ,2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission determined that the ''Project A-O'' officers "lacked experience

A '''security guard''' (also known as a '''security inspector''' or '''protective agent''') is a person employed by a public or private party to protect the employing party’s assets ([[property]], people, equipment, money, etc.) from a variety of hazards (such as waste, damaged property, unsafe worker behavior, criminal activity such as theft, etc.) by enforcing  preventative measures. Security guards do this by maintaining a high-visibility presence to deter illegal and inappropriate actions, looking (either directly, through patrols, or indirectly, by monitoring [[alarm|alarm systems]] or [[closed-circuit television|video surveillance cameras]]) for signs of crime or other hazards (such as a fire), taking action to minimize damage (such as warning and escorting trespassers off property), and reporting any incidents to their clients and [[emergency services]] (such as the police or paramedics), as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/SOBrotherhood/|title=Security Officer's Brotherhood (Facebook group)|accessdate=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Security officers are generally [[uniform]]ed to represent their lawful [[authority]] to protect private property. Security guards are generally governed by legal regulations, which set out the requirements for eligibility (e.g., a criminal record check) and the permitted authorities of a security guard in a given jurisdiction. The authorities permitted to security guards vary by country and subnational jurisdiction. Security officers are hired by a range of organizations, including businesses, government departments and agencies and not-for-profit organizations (e.g., churches and charitable organizations).

Until the 1980s, the term '''[[watchman (law enforcement)|watchman]]''' was more commonly applied to this function, a usage dating back to at least the [[Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]] where there was no form of law enforcement (other than it being a private matter). This term was carried over to North America where it was interchangeable with '''night-watchman''' [e.g. security guard] until both terms were replaced with the modern security-based titles. [[Security officers]] are sometimes regarded as fulfilling a [[private policing]] function.

== Functions and duties ==
[[File:Bgpsp.jpeg|thumbnail|right|Bodyguard protects Members of Parliament during public visits by visitors in the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic]] in 2015.]]
Many security firms and proprietary security departments practice the "detect, deter, observe and report" methodology. Security officers are not required to make arrests, but have the authority to make a [[citizens arrest|citizen's arrest]], or otherwise act as an agent of law enforcement, for example, at the request of a [[police officer]] or [[sheriff]].

A private security officer's responsibility is protecting their client from a variety of hazards (usually in the form of criminal acts). Security personnel enforce company rules and can act to protect lives and property, and they often have a contractual obligation to provide these actions. In addition to basic deterrence, security officers are often trained to perform specialized tasks such as arrest and control (including handcuffing and restraints), operate emergency equipment, perform [[first aid]], [[CPR]], take accurate notes, write detailed reports, and perform other tasks as required by the client they are serving. All security officers are also required to go through additional training mandated by the state for the carrying of weapons such as batons, firearms, and pepper spray (e.g. the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services in California has requirements that a license for ''each'' item listed must be carried while on duty).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bsis.ca.gov/forms_pubs/poa.pdf |title=Power to Arrest Training Manual - California Bureau of Security and Investigative Services |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some officers are required to complete police certification for special duties.  Virginia training standards for security are identical to police training with regards to firearms (shotgun and handgun) but do not place licensing requirements for other items carried, only that training be provided that is documented.  Several security companies have also become certified in RADAR and trained their sworn special police officers to use it on protected properties in conjunction with lights/sirens, allowing them to legally enforce traffic laws on private property.&lt;ref name="securityresources.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securityresources.net/Learn-How-to-Be-a-Licensed-Security-Guard.aspx|title=How to Become a Licensed Security Guard|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of jobs is expected to grow in the U.S., with 175,000 new security jobs expected before 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos159.htm#outlook |title=Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008-09 Edition |publisher=Bls.gov |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330055228/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos159.htm#outlook |archivedate=2010-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, due to elevated threats of terrorism, most security officers are required to have bomb-threat training and/or emergency crisis training, especially those located in [[soft target]] areas such as shopping malls, schools, and any other area where the general public congregate. One major economic justification for security personnel is that [[insurance]] companies (particularly fire insurance carriers) will give substantial rate discounts to sites which have a 24-hour presence. For a high risk or high value property, the discount can often exceed the money being spent on its security program.  Discounts are offered because having security on site increases the odds that any fire will be noticed and reported to the local fire department before a total loss occurs.  Also, the presence of security officers (particularly in combination with effective security procedures) tends to diminish "[[shrinkage (accounting)|shrinkage]]", theft, employee misconduct and safety rule violations, property damage, or even [[sabotage]]. Many [[casino]]s hire security officers to protect money when transferring it from the casino to the casino's bank.

Security personnel may also perform [[access control]] at building entrances and vehicle gates; meaning, they ensure that employees and visitors display proper passes or identification before entering the facility. Security officers are called upon to respond to potential hazards (such as broken lights or doors, disturbances, lost persons, minor injuries, etc.) and to assist in serious emergencies (medicals, fires, crime, etc.) by securing the scene to prevent further loss or damage, summoning emergency responders to the incident, helping to redirect foot traffic to safe locations, and by documenting what happened on an incident report to give their client an idea of how to prevent similar situations from occurring. Armed security officers are frequently contracted to respond as law enforcement until a given situation at a client location is under control and/or public authorities arrive on the scene.

Patrolling is usually a large part of a security officer's duties, as most incidents are prevented by being looked for instead of waiting for them to occur. Often these patrols are logged by use of a [[guard tour patrol system]], which require regular patrols. Until recently the most commonly used form used to be [[watch clock|mechanical clock]] systems that required a key for manual punching of a number to a strip of paper inside with the time pre-printed on it.  But recently, electronic systems have risen in popularity due to their light weight, ease of use, and downloadable logging capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morsewatchman.com/products/powercheck.shtml |title=Morse Watchmans &amp;#124; Products &amp;#124; PowerCheck |publisher=Morsewatchman.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular patrols are, however, becoming less accepted as an industry standard, as it provides predictability for the would-be criminal, as well as monotony for the security officer on duty. Random patrols are easily programmed into electronic systems, allowing greater freedom of movement and unpredictability. [[Global positioning systems]] are beginning to be used because they are a more effective means of tracking officers' movements and behavior.

==Personnel==
Although security officers differ from police officers, military personnel, federal agents/officers, and the like, Australia and the United States have a growing proportion of security personnel that have former police or military experience, including senior management personnel. On the other hand, some security officers, young people in particular, use the job as practical experience to use in applying to law enforcement agencies.

===Types of personnel and companies===

Industry terms for security personnel include: security guard, security officer, security agent, [[safety patrol]], private police, [[company police]], security enforcement officer, and [[public safety]]. Terms for specialized jobs include [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]], [[bodyguards]], executive protection agent, [[loss prevention]], alarm responder, hospital security officer, mall security officer, crime prevention officer, patrolman, private patrol officer, and private patrol operator.

[[File:Guangzhou-Cash-transport-0454.jpg|thumb|[[Cash in transit]] van with a crew of security guards in [[Guangzhou]], China]]
State and local governments sometimes regulate the use of these terms by law—for example, certain words and phrases that "give an impression that he or she is connected in any way with the federal government, a state government, or any political subdivision of a state government" are forbidden for use by California security licensees by Business and Professions Code Section 7582.26. So the terms "private [[homicide]] police" or "special agent" would be unlawful for a security licensee to use in California. Similarly, in [[Canada]], various acts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_05p34_e.htm#BK10 |title=Private Security and Investigative Services Act, 2005, S.O. 2005, c. 34 |publisher=E-laws.gov.on.ca |date=2009-12-15 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/bills/2008/pdf/bill-010.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327001827/http://www.assembly.ab.ca/bills/2008/pdf/bill-010.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically prohibits private security personnel from using the terms ''Probation Officer'', ''law enforcement'', ''police'', or ''police officer''.

Alberta and Ontario prohibit the use of the term ''Security Officer'', which has been in widespread use in the United States for many decades. Recent changes to the act have also introduced restrictions on uniform and vehicle colours and markings to make private security personnel clearly distinctive from police personnel. Some sources feel that some of these restrictions are put in place to satisfy the [[Canadian Police Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Brian | last=Robertson | title=Province's Bill 10 makes "security officer" a punishable phrase | date=2008-05-28 | publisher=CLB MEDIA INC | url =http://www.canadiansecuritymag.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=736&amp;Itemid=85 | work =Canadian Security | pages = | accessdate = 2008-06-05 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialized VIP security guard services and companies are in high demand and are defined by their ability to protect celebrities and executives during times of unrest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wsmv.com/story/33063655/amid-fears-of-civil-unrest-celebrities-vips-turn-to-private-security-guards-for-protection-services{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a marked difference between persons performing the duties historically associated with watchmen and persons who take a more active role in protecting persons and property. The former, often called "guards", are taught the mantra "observe and report", are minimally trained, and not expected to deal with the public or confront criminals.

The latter are often highly trained, sometimes armed depending on contracts agreed upon with clientele, and are more likely to interact with the general public and to confront the criminal element. These employees tend to take pride in the title "Security Officer" or "[[Certified Protection Officer|Protection Officer]]" and disdain the label of "guard". Security jobs vary in pay and duties. There is sometimes little relationship between duties performed and compensation, for example some mall "security officers" who are exposed to serious risks earn less per hour than "industrial security guards" who have less training and responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.securityguardservicesguide.com/wages.php |title=security guard services guide |accessdate=2007-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221104846/http://www.securityguardservicesguide.com/wages.php |archive-date=2007-12-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are now more positions in the security role that separate not just the titles, but the job itself. The roles have progressed and so have the areas for which security people are needed. The term "agent" can be confusing in the security industry because it can describe a civil legal relationship between an employee and their employer or contractor ("agent of the owner" in California PC 602), and also can describe a person in government service ("[[Special Agent]] Jones of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]".) The title "agent" can be confused with bail enforcement agents, also known as "bounty hunters", who are sometimes regulated by the same agencies which regulate private security.  The term "agent" is also used in other industries, such as banking agents, loan agents and real estate agents. Security agents are often employed in loss prevention and personal or executive protection (bodyguards) roles. They typically work in plainclothes (without a uniform), and are usually highly trained to act lawfully in direct defense of life or property.

Security officers are private citizens, and therefore are bound by the same laws and regulations as the citizenry they are contracted to serve, and therefore are not allowed to represent themselves as law enforcement under penalty of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.ceres.ca.us/weeklyarticle/20070801.html |title=City of Ceres, California, Chief de Werk's Weekly Article |publisher=Ci.ceres.ca.us |date=2007-08-01 |accessdate=2010-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213200406/http://www.ci.ceres.ca.us/weeklyarticle/20070801.html |archive-date=2009-02-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oregon.gov/OSP/PATROL/docs/Law_Enforcement_Impersonators.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-10-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228181823/http://www.oregon.gov/OSP/PATROL/docs/Law_Enforcement_Impersonators.pdf |archive-date=2008-02-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as with the police profession, training requirements for the private security industry have evolved over time.&lt;ref name="securityresources.net"/&gt; For many years security officers were poorly chosen and poorly trained (if at all), partly because security companies who contracted with clients in private industry were paid very little for their security services. For the most part, contracts were awarded to security officer companies through a competition process and the final selection was often made based on cost rather than the experience or professionalism of the security guard company. That changed drastically on September 11, 2001 when radical  terrorists attacked the United States. The event moved corporate threat concerns to the top of the priority list for most security guard contracts started being awarded based on professionalism. More money was invested in security so more money became available for training of security guards. The term 'security professional' began to surface and large private security companies like Blackwater, USA began offering training services for the private security industry that approached the level of training provided by the military. Security companies began paying enough to attract people with significant backgrounds in law enforcement and the military, often in special operations.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

=== Australia ===
{{Expand section|date=August 2009}}
Any person who conducts a business or is employed in a security-related field within Australia is required to be licensed. Each of the six states and two territories of Australia have separate legislation that covers all security activities. Licensing management in each state/territory is varied and is carried out by either Police, Attorney General's Department, Justice Department or the Department of Consumer Affairs.
* New South Wales—(Police) Security Industry Act 1997 &amp; Security Industry Regulation 2016
* Victoria—(Police) Private Security Act 2004
* Queensland—(Justice &amp; Attorney-General) Security Providers Act 1993
* South Australia—(Consumer &amp; Business Affairs) Security and Investigation Agents Act 1995
* Western Australia—(Police) Security &amp; Related Activities (Control) Act 1996 &amp; Security &amp; Related Activities (Control) Regulations 1997
* Tasmania—(Police) *Security and Investigation Agents Act 2002
* Northern Territory—(Justice) Private Security Act &amp; Private Security (Security Officer/Crowd Controller/Security Firms/Miscellaneous Matters) Regulations;
* Australian Capital Territory—(Regulatory Services) Security Industry Act 2003 &amp; Security Industry Regulation 2003
All of this legislation was intended to enhance the integrity of the private security industry.

All persons licensed to perform security activities are required to undertake a course of professional development in associated streams that are recognised nationally. This has not always been the case and the introduction of this requirement is expected to regulate the educational standards and knowledge base so that the particular job can be competently performed. Strict requirements are laid down as to the type of uniform and badge used by security companies. Uniforms or badges that may be confused with a police officer are prohibited. Also, the use of the titles 'Security Police' or 'Private Detective' are unacceptable. While the term security guard is used by companies, government bodies and individuals, the term security officer is deemed more suitable. Bouncers use the title Crowd Controllers, and Store Detectives use the title Loss Prevention or Asset Protection Officers. Security Officers may  carry firearms, handcuffs or batons where their role requires them to do so and then only when working and have the appropriate sub-class accreditation to their license.

=== Canada ===

[[File:Montreal Security 2009 067.jpg|thumb|Security vehicle and officer in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].]]

In [[Canada]], private security falls under the jurisdiction of Canada's ten provinces and three territories. All ten of Canada's provinces and one of its territories (the Yukon) have legislation that regulates the contract security industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_05p34_e.htm |title=Licences and Forms |accessdate=2007-09-03 |author=Government of Ontario, Canada. |work=Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services |publisher=Government of Ontario }}&lt;/ref&gt; These eleven jurisdictions require that companies that provide security guard services and their employees be licensed. Most provinces in Canada regulate the use of handcuffs and weapons (such as firearms and batons) by contract security companies and their employees, either banning such use completely or permitting it only under certain circumstances. Additionally, in some provinces, some terms, or variations of them, are prohibited either on a uniform or in self-reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_05p34_e.htm#BK54 |title=Licences and Forms |accessdate=2007-09-03 |author=Government of Ontario, Canada. |work=Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services |publisher=Government of Ontario }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's federal laws also restrict the ability of security officers to be armed. For example, section 17 of the Firearms Act makes it an offense for any person, including a security officer, to possess prohibited or restricted firearms (i.e. handguns) anywhere outside of his or her home. There are two exceptions to this prohibition found in sections 18 and 19 of the Act. Section 18 deals with transportation of firearms while Section 19 deals with allowing persons to carry such firearms on their persons to protect their lives or the lives of other persons, or for the performance of their occupation (Armour Car Guards, Licensed Trappers), provided an Authorization to Carry (ATC) is first obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securityalberta.com/employment |title=Licences and Forms |accessdate=2012-09-03 |author=Government of Alberta, Canada. |work=Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services Alberta |publisher=Government of Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====British Columbia====
Private security in the province of British Columbia is governed by two pieces of legislation: the Security Services Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.security-guard.ca/security-guard-british-columbia/security-services-act-government-of-canada-british-columbia/ |title=Security Services Act |publisher= Security Guards in Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Security Services Regulation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bclaws.ca/Recon/document/freeside/--%20s%20--/security%20services%20act%20%20sbc%202007%20%20c.%2030/05_regulations/10_207_2008.xml |title=Security Services Regulation |accessdate=2009-03-12 |publisher=Government of British Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws are administered and enforced by the Security Programs and Police Technology Division&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/securityindustry/ |title=Security Programs and Police Technology Division |accessdate=2009-03-12 |publisher=British Columbia Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General. The legislation requires that guards must be at least 19 years old, undergo a criminal background check, and successfully complete a training course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jibc.ca/police/programs/security_training/intro%20to%20security%20training.htm |title=JIBC &amp;#124; Police Academy &amp;#124; Security Training - BST1 BST2 |publisher=Jibc.ca |date=2008-09-01 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As far as weapons, British Columbia law severely restricts their use by security officers. Section 11(1)(c) of the Security Services Regulation prohibits security personnel from carrying or using any "item designed for debilitating or controlling a person or animal", which the government interprets to include all weapons. As well, section 11 forbids private security from using or carrying restraints, such as handcuffs, unless authorized by the government. However, as in other parts of Canada, armoured car officers are permitted to carry firearms. In the past, only personnel that worked for contract security, that is, security companies, were regulated in British Columbia. However, as of September 1, 2009, in-house security officers and private investigators came under the jurisdiction of the Security Services Act and Security Services Regulation. Bodyguards and bouncers, effective November 1, 2009, are also subject to these regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/securityindustry/news/index.htm |title=News and Updates |publisher=British Columbia Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General |accessdate=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
[[File:Stockholm Pride 2015 Parade by Jonatan Svensson Glad 132.JPG|thumb|left|Security officer at 2015 [[Stockholm Pride]] Parade.]]
Armed private security officers are much rarer in [[Europe]], and illegal in many countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Netherlands]]. In developing countries (with host country permission), an armed security force composed mostly of ex-military personnel is often used to protect corporate assets, particularly in [[war-torn]] regions.

As a requirement of the Private Security Industry Act 2001, the UK now requires all contract security officers to have a valid [[Security Industry Authority]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-sia.org.uk/home/about_sia/legislation/psia.htm |title=SIA website |publisher=The-sia.org.uk |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licence must be displayed when on duty, although a dispensation may be granted for store detectives, bodyguards and others who need to operate without being identified as a security guard. This dispensation is not available to Vehicle Immobilisers. Licenses are valid for three years and require the holders to undergo formal training, and are also to pass mandatory Criminal Records Bureau checks. Licences for Vehicle Immobilisers are valid for one year. Armed guarding and guarding with a weapon are illegal.

In [[Finland]], all contract security officers are required to have a valid license granted by police. Temporary license is valid for four months and normal license for five years. License requires a minimum 40-hour course for temporary license and 80 hours more for a normal license. Additionally a narrow security vetting is required. The 40-hour course does not allow the guard to carry any kind of special equipment such as a baton or handcuffs. Guards have to complete the 80-hour course to carry these. Separate training and license is required for the security guard to carry [[pepper spray]], extendable baton or a firearm. Rehearse of weapons usage is mandatory every year and is regulated by the Ministry of The Interior, to ensure the safe handling of pepper spray and such. Firearms can only be carried by [[bodyguard]]s and [[cash-in-transit]] guards or when guarding a person or object that is significant in terms of public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Private Security Services Act|url=http://finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2002/en20020282.pdf|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Finland, a security guard has the right to detain a person "red-handed", or seen committing a crime and the right to search the detained individual for harmful items and weapons. An individual who has been forcefully detained can only be released by the police. All companies providing security guarding services are also required to have a valid license from [[Ministry of the Interior (Finland)|the Ministry of the Interior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intermin.fi/turvavalvontayksikko |title=Ministry of the Interior unit for supervision of the private security industry |publisher=Intermin.fi |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226013623/http://www.intermin.fi/turvavalvontayksikko |archive-date=2010-02-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Netherlands]], security officers ([[beveiligingsbeambte]]) must undergo a criminal background check by the local police department in the area where the [[private security company]] is located. To become a security guard in the Netherlands, a person must complete the basic training level 2 [[Beveiliger2]]. To complete the training a trainee must undergo a three-month internship with a private security company that is licensed by the [[svpb]], the board that controls security exams. A trainee guard must pass for his diploma within one year. If the trainee does not pass he is not allowed to work anymore until he completes his training with a positive result. After a positive result a new ID can be issued and is valid for three years, after which the officer must undergo a background check by the local police again. Security officers in the Netherlands are not allowed to carry any kind of weapon or handcuffs. Every uniformed security guard in the Netherlands must have the V symbol on his or her uniform to advise the public they are dealing with a private guard; this rule is mandated by the Ministry of Justice. Security uniforms may not look like similar to police uniforms, and may not contain any kind of rank designation. The colors yellow and gold are not allowed to be used because the Dutch police uses gold accents in their uniforms; also, wearing a uniform cap is not allowed. Every new uniform design or addition must be approved by the Ministry of Justice before use. A patrol vehicle may not look like a police striped vehicle. The only private security officers who are allowed to carry firearms are those who work for the military or Dutch National bank ([[De Nederlandsche Bank]]); this is where the national gold reserve can be found.

==== Norway ====
In [[Norway]] security officers are called "Vektere". There are two different types of vektere{{mdash}}the normal uniformed or civil-clothing officers who watch over private and semi-public properties, and government-hired vektere who work in public places, such as the Parliament. The law provides more enforcement powers to security officers in the Parliament than to private security officers. Security officers must undergo three weeks of training and internship. They are allowed to work for six months after one week of the introduction course. It is also possible to choose Security as a high school major, which requires two years of school and two years of trainee positions at private companies, resulting in a certificate from the government. This certificate makes it easier to get a job, with slightly higher pay. It also makes it easier to get a job elsewhere in the security industry. The certificate can also be obtained by private security officers who have had a minimum of 5 years working experience. No security officer may carry pepper spray, batons or any other kind of weapon. However, handcuffs may be used. Norges Bank (Bank of Norway, federal reserves) had armed government guards until late 2013, when they were disarmed by the minister of finance. Security officers serving on ships sailing in areas of high piracy risk may be equipped with firearms. Uniforms should not resemble police worn attire, but some uniforms do. The uniform must have the text 'VEKTER' or 'SIKKERHET' above the left shirt pocket.

A security officer, or any other person, may detain or arrest anyone that violates any law, as long as the violation carries a punishment of minimum six (6) months imprisonment and a fine. The detainee must be released or handed over to the authorities within 4 hours of the arrest. Security officers assigned to public transportation, such as trains, subways, trams and buses, also have some powers under the Transportloven (transportation law). Security officers may issue fixed penalty tickets for violation of parking regulations in designated areas and for passengers on public transportation without a valid pass. A security officer may only search (frisk) a person to prevent the use of or confiscate any type of weapon or anything that can be used as a weapon. In 2006, some security officers (Vakt Service/Nokas) were given extended training and limited police authority to transport prisoners between police holding cells, jails and courts, etc. Due to an outcry from the police union, this program was scrapped after a few months.

In addition to normal "vektere" there also is a special branch for "Ordensvakter" who normally work as [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncers]] or security at concerts and similar types of events. Ordensvakter have to undergo an extra week of training to learn techniques on how to handle drunk people and people on various drugs. They also learn about the alcohol laws of [[Norway]] (which are rather strict). The police in the local police district must approve each Ordensvakt. These special regulations arose after events in the 1990s when bouncers had a bad reputation, especially in [[Oslo]], for being too brutal and rough with people. At that time, the police had no control over who worked as bouncers. After the government implemented training and mandatory police-issued ID cards for bouncers the problems have been reduced. The police of Oslo report that Ordensvakter are now helping the police identify crimes that otherwise would not be reported. In 2013, due to a high number of rapes and violent robberies, the city of Oslo (Oslo Kommune) hired a private security company (Metro Garda) to patrol the downtown immigrant areas. This patrol had a positive effect, and the city has, in addition to Metro Garda officers, now hired their own officers called Bymiljøetaten (City environment dep). The municipalities in Norway are not allowed to form their own "police". The only police force in Norway is the federal police (politi).

In 2007, several officers from the [[Securitas AB]] company were arrested for brutality against a robber they apprehended on the main street of Oslo. The crime was captured with a mobile camera by pedestrians and created a public outcry, with many objecting to the way the security guards took the law into their own hands. Later, it came to light that the thief first attacked the security guards when they approached him, so the brutality charges were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2007/12/14/521246.html |title=Får ingen konsekvenser for vekterne |publisher=dagbladet.no |date= |accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this episode, the police said that they would be more careful when conducting criminal background checks for security guards. Before 2007 security guards were checked when they applied for a job, but not while they were working. Security companies were also criticized for not checking criminal records sufficiently, in some cases not at all. Now guards working in private security must be checked annually. The police have the authority to withdraw a company's licence if the company does not submit lists of employees to the police. The police in Norway were widely criticized for not checking guards properly, and even when they encounter an issue with a guard, the guard can still work for months before anything is done. The security company [[G4S]], after being criticized by police for hiring criminals, stated that they cannot do anything about the problem, because only the police have the ability to check the guard's criminal records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ringblad.no/jobb/article4876392.ece|title=Ringerikes Blad - Kriminelle vektere slipper unna|website=www.ringblad.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Norwegian media reported that off-duty police officers and Home Guard soldiers had contracts of armed employment on civilian ships in the Aden bay, and police leaders were planning sanctions against the use of police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://klassekampen.no/59975/article/item/null/krigar-i-privat-teneste |title=Private sikkerheitsselskap leiger ut heimevernssoldatar og politimenn som væpna vakter på norske skip.

The police have around 10,000 employees in total.

=== Hong Kong ===
[[File:Whampoa Garden security post.jpg|thumbnail|Watchman on duty at a residential block in Hong Kong.]]
In Hong Kong, the term ''Security Officer'' refers to a senior staff member who supervises a team of security personnel. The staff who work under security officers' supervision are called
''Security Guards''.

====Legislation====
Before 1 October 1996, private security personnel were regulated by the ''Watchmen Ordinance'' (Chapter 299). However, there were many problems with that system of regulation—for example, there were no restrictions as to whom may establish private security service companies to provide security services to a client. Also, there was no regulation of people whom may perform installation of security systems. Some employers hired "caretakers" instead of security guards to avoid their responsibilities under the ordinance (in formal definition, "caretakers" are supposed to provide facilities management service, although security service, which provided to residential properties, takes some parts of facilities management service). As a result, the Hong Kong Government enacted a wholly new law, the ''Security and Guarding Services Ordinance'' (Chapter 460), to replace the ''Watchmen Ordinance''.

According to the ''Security and Guarding Services Ordinance'':
No individual shall do, agree to do, or hold himself/herself out as doing, or as available to do, security work for another person unless he/she does so-
* Under and in accordance with a permit; or
* Otherwise than for reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/460/s10.html |title=Security and Guarding Services Ordinance - Sect 10 Restrictions on doing security work |publisher=Hklii.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Security work'' means any of the following activities-
* Guarding any property;
* Guarding any person or place for the purpose of preventing or detecting the occurrence of any offence; (Replaced 25 of 2000 s. 2)
* Installing, maintaining or repairing a security device;
* Designing for any particular premises or place a system incorporating a security device.

''Security device'' means a device designed or adapted to be
installed in any premises or place, except on or in a vehicle, for the purpose
of detecting or recording- (Amended 25 of 2000 s. 2)
* The occurrence of any offence; or
* The presence of an intruder or of an object that persons are, for reasons of security, not permitted to bring onto the premises or place or any other premises or place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/460/s2.html |title=Security and Guarding Services Ordinance - Sect 2 Interpretation |publisher=Hklii.org |date=1997-06-30 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualification==
Qualification for security guards vary from country to country. Different requirements have to be completed before applying for this job.

===Hong Kong===
[[File:HK Security001.jpg|thumb|center|501px|&lt;center&gt;A group of Hong Kong security guards in formation before going on duty&lt;/center&gt;]]

Any applicant who wishes to apply for a Security Personnel Permit (SPP) must:
* He/she have been living in Hong Kong for at least 5 years. (This requirement may have been changed)
* No criminal record.
* At least 17 years old when submitting his/her application.
* Have passed a mandatory 16-hour training course and have been granted a certificate of the course.
* If the applicant is over 65 years old, he/she must submit his/her health examination report.

====Permit====
Security Personnel Permit was separated to four types: A, B, C, and D.
* Type A permit holder was permitted to work in a "single-block" residential building; they are not allowed to carry firearms. No age limit.
* Type B permit holder was permitted to work in any type of properties, but they also are not allowed carry firearms. The maximum age limit of this permit is 65.
* Type C permit holder was permitted to work as an armed guard. (Usually, they are members of the cash transport car crew.) The maximum age limit of this permit is 55.
* Type D permit holder was permitted to design, install, and repair security devices. No maximum age limit.
The permit is valid for five years. All holders must renew their permit before it expires, or they will lose their qualification to work, as such, until their permit is renewed.

The type A and Type B security service are gradually combined with [[property management]] service, though the boundary between these two industries is unclear.

====Power of arrest====
Security Guards in [[Hong Kong]] do not have special powers of arrest above that of the ordinary citizen, i.e. [[citizen's arrest]], also known locally as the "101 arrest power". The Section 101 in the Criminal Procedure Ordinance addresses that arrest of an offender by a private citizen is allowed in certain circumstances if the offender is attempting an arrestable offense. Once arrested, the suspect must be delivered to a police office as soon as possible. An arrestable offence is defined as any crime carrying a sentence of more than 12 months imprisonment. No security personnel are allowed to search other person, nor are they allowed to get personal information from other people, with the exception of some specific circumstances.

[[File:Israel Batch 1 (889).JPG|thumb|left|Security personnel at the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]].]]

=== Israel ===
In [[Israel]], almost all security guards carry a firearm, primarily to prevent [[terror attack]]s. Security guards are common: they perform entrance checks at shopping malls, transportation terminals, government and other office buildings, and many stores. Many locations with a high number of visitors, such as the [[Jerusalem Central Bus Station]], employ X-ray machines to check passenger's bags; in other places, they are opened and visually inspected. Since 2009, private security guards companies as [[Mikud (company)|Mikud]] have also replaced official security forces at some checkpoints inside and on the border of the [[West Bank]], as well as the crossings to [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].

=== Malaysia ===
The private security industry is regulated by the Ministry of Home Affairs (Kementerian Dalam Negeri). As of 2018, all private security companies in Malaysia must have a minimum of 80% of their employees complete a Certified Security Guard Training Course &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unityforce.com.my/unity_force_kdn.pdf|title=Surat Latihan CSG, Certified Security Guard (CSG) Training|publisher=Kementerian Dalam Negeri|accessdate=2014-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to receive approval to renew their Private Agency License. [[Peninsular Malaysia]] allows for the use of [[Nepal]]ese security guards whereby [[East Malaysia]]n immigration policy does not allow the use of foreign workers to be employed in the security industry.

=== South Africa ===
{{Main|Private security industry in South Africa}}
Security guards along with the rest of the private security industry are regulated under Act 56 of 2001, Private Security Industry Regulation Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=68158|title=Act 56 of 2001, Private Security Industry Regulation Act|publisher=South African Government|accessdate=2009-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604103430/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=68158|archive-date=2011-06-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Private security guards have outnumbered police officers since the 1980s, predating the heightened concern about security brought on by the September 11, 2001, attacks. The more than 1 million contract security officers, and an equal number of guards estimated to work directly for U.S. corporations, is much greater than the nearly 700,000 sworn law enforcement officers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/01/07/MNGVENCASV1.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=More security firms getting police powers / Some see benefits to public safety, but others are wary | first=Amy | last=Goldstein | date=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most states require a [[license]] to work as a security officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos159.htm#training |title=Security Guards and Gaming Surveillance Officers |publisher=Bls.gov |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330055228/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos159.htm#training |archivedate=2010-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This license may include a criminal [[background check]] or mandated training requirements. Security guards have the same powers of arrest as a private citizen, called a "private person" arrest, "any person" arrest, or "[[citizen's arrest]]". If weapons are carried, additional permits and training are usually required. Armed security personnel are generally employed to protect sensitive sites such as government and military installations, armored money transports, casinos, banks and other financial institutions, and nuclear power plants. However, armed security is quickly becoming a standard for vehicle patrol officers and on many other non-government sites.

In some states, companies are developing technology to enhance private security. Using behavior analysis, computers can detect threats more quickly with fewer errors in judgement. Using specific algorithms, a computer can now detect aggressive and defensive body language, which triggers an alert to security or proper authorities depending on the event. These systems can also track slips and falls, theft and other events commonly experienced in corporate America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amrelitech.com/amrelitech/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=1&amp;tabid=84|title=Amreli Technology Solutions|website=www.amrelitech.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The responsibilities of security guards in the United States are expanding in scope.&lt;ref name="securityresources.net"/&gt; For example, a trend is the increasing use of private security to support services previously provided by police departments. [[James F. Pastor]] addresses substantive legal and public policy issues which directly or indirectly relate to the provision of security services. These can be demonstrated by the logic of alternative or supplemental service providers. The use of [[private police]] has particular appeal because property or business owners can directly contract for [[public safety]] services, thereby providing welcome relief for municipal budgets. Finally, private police functions can be flexible, depending upon the financial, organizational, political, and circumstances of the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Privatization of Police In America: An Analysis and Case Study|last=Pastor|first=James F.|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7864-1574-8|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''California''' — Security Guards are required to obtain a license from the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services (BSIS), of the [[California Department of Consumer Affairs]]. Applicants must be at least 18 years old, undergo a criminal history background check through the [[California Department of Justice]] (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and complete a 40-hour course of required training. This required training is broken down into smaller training sections and time-lines. The first is 8 hours of BSIS-designed instruction on [[power of arrest|powers to arrest]] and weapons. Then, within 30 days of getting the individual officers license, they must receive 16 hours of training on various mandatory and elective courses. Finally, within 6 months of getting their license, they must receive an additional 16 hours of training on various mandatory and elective courses. California security officers are also required to complete 8 hours of annual training on security-related topics, in addition to the initial 40 hours of training. The training and exam may be administered by any private patrol operator or by any of a large number of certified training facilities. This training can be in the classroom or online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bsis.ca.gov/industries_regulated/g_train.shtml |title=New Security Guard Training Regulation - Bureau of Security and Investigative Services |publisher=Bsis.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318004359/http://www.bsis.ca.gov/industries_regulated/g_train.shtml |archive-date=2010-03-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsis.ca.gov/forms_pubs/guard_fact.shtml |title=Security Guard Fact Sheet - Bureau of Security and Investigative Services |publisher=Bsis.ca.gov |date=2007-03-23 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Jersey''' — As of 2006 all security personnel employed by a "security officer company" which provides security services to other entities by contract must undergo a state mandated certified training program. This law, commonly referred to as SORA, is the state's effort to increase the quality of security personnel. Security personnel employed by other types of businesses do not require the SORA certification card. However, those employed by the Atlantic City casinos are required to have the state issued "Casino Employee Registration" card.

'''New Mexico''' — As of 2008 all security guards must undergo FBI background checks and a certified training program. Guards who carry firearms must also undergo additional training with a firearm through an approved firearms instructor and pass a psychological exam. The security industry is regulated through the New Mexico Regulation and Licensing Division.

'''North Carolina''' — Security Officers in North Carolina are required to register and become certified with the Private Protective Services Board (PPSB), the private security authority body under the [[North Carolina Department of Justice]]. The purpose of the Private Protective Services Board is to administer the licensing, education and training requirements for persons, firms, associations and corporations engaged in private protective services within North Carolina. The board is totally fee funded and is staffed by departmental employees directed on a daily basis by the Director, who is appointed by the Attorney General. There are two classifications for an officer: armed and unarmed. While an unarmed officer is required to take a 16-hour class of training and instruction to become certified, an armed officer must take additional hours of classroom training as well as qualify on a gun range with the firearm which will be carried on duty.

'''Oklahoma''' — Security officers in Oklahoma are licensed by CLEET ([[Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training]]). To be licensed as an unarmed officer an individual must be at least 18 years of age and undergo 40 hours of classroom training and pass criminal history checks. Armed guards must be 21 years of age, have another 40 hours of classroom training, qualify with their firearm and pass a psychological evaluation.

'''Oregon''' — Department of Public Safety, Standards and Training

'''Pennsylvania''' — No licensing requirements to be an unarmed security guard. However, anyone who carried a firearm or other "lethal weapon" in the course and scope of their employment must be trained as a "Certified Agent" and successfully complete a 40-hour training course (including shooting range time) in order to be certified to carry weapons while on duty under the Lethal Weapons Training Act (commonly referred to as Act 235 certification). Certification involves completing a medical physical exam, a psychological examination, classroom training and qualifying on a pistol range, with firing of 50 rounds of ammo larger than a .380acp. Agents are also required to qualify on a shotgun. The certification is good for five years at which time an eight-hour refresher course must be taken or the certification is revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/lethal_weapons_training_program/7611|title=PA State Police—Lethal Weapons Training Program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''South Carolina''' — All Security Officers have the same authority and power of arrest as Sheriff's Deputies, while on the property they are paid to protect, and according to Attorney General Alan Wilson, are considered Law Enforcement for the purpose of making arrests and swearing out a warrant before the magistrate.&lt;ref&gt;South Carolina Code of Laws, Title 40, Chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt; Private Officers may respond to calls for service, make arrests and use blue lights&lt;ref&gt;South Carolina Code of Laws, Title 56, Chapter 5 Section 170&lt;/ref&gt; and traffic radar. They may also be specially authorized by the [[South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division|State Law Enforcement Division]] (SLED) to issue Uniform Traffic Tickets to violators.&lt;ref&gt;South Carolina, Attorney General's Opinion: Aug 01,1978 Apr 30, 1987 May 23, 1995 Aug 30, 2001 Oct 15, 2004 and State V. Brant (S.C.1982) 278 S.C. 188,293 SE2d 703&lt;/ref&gt; Security Officers are licensed or registered (as appropriate) by SLED for one year at a time. Training for unarmed officers is 8 hours, an additional 8 hours is required for a security weapons permit or a concealed security weapons permit. Additional hours are required to be documented for officers issuing public or private tickets as well as officers who will be using batons, pepper spray or tasers.

'''Virginia''' — Since the 1980s, Security Officers in Virginia are required to be certified by DCJS (Department of Criminal Justice Services, the same agency that certifies law enforcement officers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+coh+9.1-139+500887 |title=Legislative Information System |publisher=Leg1.state.va.us |date=2003-01-01 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be certified as an unarmed security officer one must go through 18 hours of classroom training from a certified instructor in order to obtain this card and it must be done by the end of their 90 days after hire with a Security company. Every two years the card must be renewed, by completing an in-service with a certified instructor. To be certified as an armed security officer one must complete an additional 24 hours of firearms training, 8 hours of training in conducting a lawful arrest, and qualification with the type and caliber of weapon they intend to carry. Firearms endorsements must be renewed annually by completing an in-service and passing a firearms qualification. Certified armed security officers are authorized under state code to arrest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+coh+9.1-146+702220 |title=Legislative Information System |publisher=Leg1.state.va.us |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; for any offense committed in their presence while they are on duty at the location they are hired to protect. Unarmed officers have no arrest powers. They also are granted the authority by the state law to issue summons to appear in court&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+19.2-74 |title=LIS &gt; Code of Virginia &gt; 19.2-74 |publisher=Leg1.state.va.us |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; for felonies and misdemeanors. Virginia also allows security officers to attend additional 40 hours of training to become certified as Conservators of the Peace (Special Police) for the company employing them. This appointment is performed by a Circuit Court Judge, wherein the officer is actually sworn in and has the powers of a police officer on property they are working, as well as the lawful duty to act upon witnessing any felony and the ability to pursue fleeing felons. Such sworn officers are also permitted the use of sirens and red lights. Those who handle K-9s, work as dispatchers, alarm responders, private investigators, instructors, bounty hunters, armored car couriers and Executive Protection Specialists are other categories of training regulated by DCJS with additional training requirements. All positions require [[Virginia State Police|State Police]] and FBI background checks.

'''St. Louis, Missouri''' — Security officers are required to be licensed by the [[St. Louis County Police Department]] or [[St. Louis Police Department]]. [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]] security officer training is a two-day class and yearly renewal class. Armed officers must shoot bi-annually to keep their armed status. County license is called a Metropolitan License, meaning it is good for St. Louis City and County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouisco.com/police/opersupt.html |title=Division of Operational Support Services |publisher=Stlouisco.com |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The St. Louis City web site has all the information regarding licensing requirements, as they are the same in the city and county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slmpd.org/private_security.html |title=SLMPD Private Security |publisher=Slmpd.org |date=2009-09-01 |accessdate=2010-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306002829/http://www.slmpd.org/private_security.html |archive-date=2010-03-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Texas''' — There are three types of Security Officer license types in the state of Texas. Each requires a certain level of training. All training and licensing is regulated by the Department of Public Safety's Private Security Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/OC/htm/OC.1702.htm |title=Texas Occupations Code |publisher=Texas Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three types of licenses are

; Non Commissioned Security Officer (Level II): A Non Commissioned Security Officer is unarmed and must wear a distinctive DPS approved uniform. The main purpose of this type of officer is the phrase most associated with security, Observe and Report. The Security Officer is generally there to be a good witness.
* Required Training: Level II/Non Commissioned Officer requires 6 hours of classroom based training. This course may be taught by any licensed company directly to new hires. The Owner, Qualified Manager, or a designee of the Qualified Manager may teach the course. At the completion of the course the candidate must pass a multiple choice exam. There are no pre requisites to this course or license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dps.texas.gov/rsd/psb/docs/adminrules.pdf |title=Texas Administrative Rules Section 35.041(a)(1) |publisher=Texas Private Security Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Background Check: FBI background check and electronic fingerprint imaging
* Renewal: Submission of renewal fee every two years. No required renewal course.

; Commissioned Security Officer (Level III): [[File:Security Patrol Vehicle Texas.jpg|thumb|A patrol vehicle use by Priority Protection &amp; Investigations in Texas]] A Commissioned Security Officer openly carries a handgun &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/OC/htm/OC.1702.htm |title=Texas Administrative Code 1702.169(1) |publisher=Texas Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may also carry a baton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.46.htm |title=Texas Penal Code 46.15(b)(4) |publisher=Texas Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt; chemical dispensing device (OC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.46.htm |title=Texas Penal Code 46.05(f) |publisher=Texas Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taser, etc. Commissioned Officers also must wear a distinct DPS approved uniform &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/OC/htm/OC.1702.htm |title=Texas Administrative Code 1702.169(2) |publisher=Texas Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can at no time conceal their weapon while on duty and/or in uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/OC/htm/OC.1702.htm |title=Texas Administrative Code 1702.169(3) |publisher=Texas Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main purpose of this type of officer is to actively prevent and deter crime. Observe and report is now a secondary function and the officer is to actively protect the clients and property in accordance with clients procedures as well as state/federal law.
* Required Training: Level III/Commissioned Officer requires a 40-hour Level III course. The training for this license consists of classroom based learning, defense tactics, handcuffing, and firearms training. At the completion of the course the candidate must pass a firearms proficiency test and a multiple choice exam. This license requires the previous Level II course to be completed first. This course may only be taught by a licensed Level III instructor working under a state licensed Level III security training school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dps.texas.gov/rsd/psb/docs/adminrules.pdf |title=Texas Administrative Rules Section 35.041(a)(2) |publisher=Texas Private Security Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Background Check: FBI background check and electronic fingerprint imaging
* Renewal: Submission of renewal fee and proof of completion of a 6-hour re-qualification class taught by a Level III instructor under a Level III training school. The re-qualification course requires completion of a multiple choice exam and a firearms qualification. This is done every two years.

; Personal Protection Officer (Level IV): A Personal Protection Officer (PPO) directly protects the life of their client. PPO's are the only license type able to wear plain clothes while working. PPO's in plain clothes MUST conceal their firearm, and they are also the only license type able to conceal their firearm at all. The Level IV/Personal Protection Officer license is tied to the Level III/Commissioned Officer license. To issue a PPO license the PPO candidate must be applying for at the same time or have already received a Level III/ Commissioned Security Officer license. The Security Officer's Level III and IV will also have the same expiration date regardless of date issued.
* Required Training: Level IV/ Personal Protection Officer requires a 15 hours course teaching additional law, defense tactics, considerations for personal protection of a client, and OC training. This license requires the previous Level II and Level III courses to be completed first. This course may only be taught by a licensed Level IV instructor working under a state licensed Level IV security training school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dps.texas.gov/rsd/psb/docs/adminrules.pdf |title=Texas Administrative Rules Section 35.041(a)(3) |publisher=Texas Private Security Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Orleans, Louisiana''' - The City of New Orleans Department of Police in accordance with New Orleans Home Rule Charter section 4-502 (2) (a) (b) and New Orleans Municipal Code 17-271 MCS 90-86, deputizes armed Security Officers, Private Investigators, College Campus Police, City, State, and Federal agencies, within the city limits, with limited Police Power as New Orleans Police Special Officers. New Orleans Municipal Code 17-271 MCS 30-1122 states It shall be unlawful for any person to act as an armed guard unless he is a Peace Officer. Louisiana R.S. 40:1379.1 (b) states the Special Officer, when performing those tasks requiring a Special Officer's commission, shall have the same powers and duties as a Peace Officer. Special Officers may make arrest for felony or misdemeanor offenses on the property or area they are to protect, patrol, or in relation to their direct assignment. The Special Officer when making an arrest may pat down the arrested subject for weapons. Special Officers are to turn over arrested subjects and pertaining evidence to a New Orleans Police Officer. Special Officers or to honor all subpoenas on arrest made and appear in court to testify. Special Officers when not on a particular assignment are regarded as private citizens and have no Police Power. However, Special Officers still may make an arrest for a felony, whether in or out of his presence, while not on a particular assignment, under Louisiana Law CCRP art.214 Arrest by private person; when lawful.

==Security officers and the police==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
Security personnel are not police officers, unless they are [[security police]], but are often identified as such due to similar [[uniform]]s and behaviors, especially on private property. Security personnel derive their powers from state or provincial laws, which allow them a contractual arrangement with clients that give them Agent of the Owner powers. This includes a nearly unlimited power to question with the absence of probable cause requirements that frequently dog public law enforcement officers. In essence, security officers keep private property / persons safe from hazards, whereas police officers protect entire communities by enforcing laws and arresting suspected offenders. Some jurisdictions do commission or deputize security officers and give them limited additional powers, particularly when employed in protecting public property such as mass transit stations. This is a special case that is often unique to a particular jurisdiction or locale. Additionally, security officers may also be called upon to act as an agent of law enforcement if a police officer, sheriff's deputy, etc. is in immediate need of help and has no available backup.

Some security officers do have reserve police powers and are typically employed directly by governmental agencies. Typically, these are sworn law enforcement personnel whose duties primarily involve the security of a government installation, and are also a special case. Other local and state governments occasionally enter into special contracts with security agencies to provide patrol services in public areas. These personnel are sometimes referred to as "private police officers". Sometimes, police officers work as security personnel while not on duty. This is usually done for extra income, and work is particularly done in hazardous jobs such as [[bodyguard]] work and [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncers]] outside nightclubs. Police are called in when a situation warrants a higher degree of authority to act upon reported observations that security does not have the authority to act upon. However, some states allow Licensed Security Officers full arrest powers equal to those of a Sheriff's Deputy.

In 1976, the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]]'s National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One massive resource, filled with significant numbers of personnel, armed with a wide array of technology, and directed by professionals who have spent their entire adult lifetimes learning how to prevent and reduce crime, has not been tapped by governments in the fight against criminality. The private security industry, with over one million workers, sophisticated alarm systems and perimeter safeguards, armored trucks, sophisticated mini-computers, and thousands of highly skilled crime prevention experts, offers a potential for coping with crime that can not be equalled by any other remedy or approach.... Underutilized by police, all but ignored by prosecutors and the judiciary, and unknown to corrections officials, the private security professional may be the only person in this society who has the knowledge to effectively prevent crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals (NAC-CJSG)|year=1976|title=Private Security: Report of the Task Force on Private Security|location=Washington, DC|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice, Law Enforcement Assistance Administration|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In New York City, the [[Area Police/Private Security Liaison]] program was organized in 1986 by the NYPD commissioner and four former police chiefs working in the private security industry to promote mutual respect, cross-training, and sharing of crime-related information between public police and private security.

== Trends ==

===Australia===
Private Security personnel initially outnumbered police. From the Australian Bureau of Statistics Report in 2006 there were 52,768 full-time security officers in the security industry compared to 44,898 police officers. But since Security Industry Regulation Act 2007 it has dropped to less than half that.

===United Kingdom===
The trend in the UK at the time of writing (March 2008) is one of polarisation. The market in Manned Guarding (the security industry term for the security guards most people are familiar with) is diverging toward two opposite extremes; one typified by a highly trained and well paid security officer; the other with security officers on or about [[minimum wage]] with only the minimum training required by law. Within the "in-house" sector, where security personnel are not subject to licensing under the [[Security Industry Authority|Private Security Industry Act 2001]], the same divergence can be seen, with some companies opting for in-house security to maintain control of their standards, while others use it as a route to cheaper, non-regulated, security. In a very few cases, such as the [[Northern Ireland Security Guard Service]], security guards may be [[Police oath|attested]] as [[Special Constable]]s.

===United States===
Economist [[Robert B. Reich]], in his 1991 book ''[[The Work of Nations]]'', stated that in the United States, the number of private security guards and officers was comparable to the number of publicly paid police officers. He used this phenomenon as an example of the general withdrawal of the affluent from existing communities where governments provide public services. Instead, the wealthy pay to provide their own premium services, through voluntary, exclusive associations. As taxpayer resistance has limited government budgets, and as the demand for secure homes in [[gated communities]] has grown, these trends have continued in the 1990s and 2000s. In the aftermath of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the trend in the US is one of a quiet transformation of the role of security guards into first responders in case of a [[terrorist attack]] or major disaster. This has resulted in longer guard instruction hours, extra training in terrorism tactics and increased laws governing private security companies in some states.

== History ==
[[File:Standing Guard.jpg|thumb|Standing Guard]]

The ''[[vigiles]]'' were soldiers assigned to guard the city of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], often credited as the origin of both security personnel and police, although their principal duty was as a [[firefighter|fire brigade]]. There have been night watchmen since at least the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe; walled cities of ancient times also had watchmen. A special chair appeared in Europe sometime in the late Middle Ages, called the [[watchman's chair]]; this unupholstered wooden chair had a forward slanting seat to prevent the watchman from dozing off during duty.

==Notable individuals ==
* In June 1972, [[Frank Wills (security guard)|Frank Wills]], a security guard at the [[Watergate complex|Watergate office complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], noticed a piece of tape covering the latch on an entrance to one of the buildings, thereby preventing it from locking. Police, who Wills subsequently notified, arrested five men in the portion of the building occupied by the [[Democratic National Committee|Democratic National Committee (DNC)]] headquarters. The following investigations and revelations — entirely enabled by Wills' discoveries and subsequent actions — ultimately led to the resignation of [[Richard Nixon|President Richard Nixon]] in what is now infamously known as the [[Watergate scandal]], considered by many to be the largest [[political scandal]] in the history of the [[United States]].
* [[Christoph Meili]], night guard at a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] bank, became a [[whistle blower]] in 1997. He told about the bank destroying records related to funds of [[Holocaust]] victims, whose money the bank was supposed to return to their heirs.
* In 1999, [[Pierlucio Tinazzi]] rescued 10 victims from the [[Mont Blanc Tunnel#The 1999 fire|Mont Blanc Tunnel Fire]], before dying while trying to rescue an eleventh.
* In 2001, [[Gary Coleman]], former child actor, was employed as an armed security officer, with permits valid for both Firearm and Baton through the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services of California in the Los Angeles area. While shopping for a bullet-resistant vest for his job, Coleman assaulted a female autograph collector. Coleman said he felt "threatened by her insistence" and punched her in the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/coleman/020499.html |title=court TV becomes truTV |publisher=Courttv.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219015819/http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/coleman/020499.html |archivedate=2008-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later charged for the assault and ordered to pay her $1,665 for hospital bills. This also ended up getting his guard card and firearms permits revoked, however his baton permit is still valid until the year 2045. It is unknown why the other two permits were revoked but his baton permit remains. He is not allowed to carry the baton while he is not physically working as a security officer. (Firearms and baton permits issued through BSIS are open carry permits, and you are required to be in uniform, and at work, on your way to or from work to carry them otherwise a separate permit must be issued by the county in California that the individual resides to carry said item off duty.)
* Derrick Brun, an unarmed security officer employed by the Red Lake School District in Minnesota, was praised by President Bush for his heroic role in protecting children during the 2005 [[Red Lake shootings]]: "Derrick's bravery cost him his life, and all Americans honor him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/03/20050326.html |title=President's Radio Address |publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |date=2005-03-26 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usafreedomcorps.gov/about_usafc/update/update.asp?ID=81 |title=Welcome to Serve.gov |publisher=Usafreedomcorps.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109235011/http://www.usafreedomcorps.gov/about_usafc/update/update.asp?ID=81 |archive-date=2009-01-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2007, [[2007 Colorado YWAM and New Life shootings|Matthew Murray]] fatally shot two and wounded two others at the Youth With A Mission retreat center in Arvada, Colorado. A few hours later he fatally shot two others and wounded another three in the New Life Church parking lot. When Murray entered the church, he was met by armed security officer Jeanne Assam, who ordered him to drop his weapon. Assam shot and wounded Murray when he failed to comply. The pastor of New Life Church credited Assam with saving over 100 lives.
* [[Richard Jewell]], a security officer at [[Atlanta, Georgia]]'s [[Centennial Olympic Park]] during the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] who was wrongly accused of the [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing]]. Jewell was later cleared of those charges, and was in fact the one who saved hundreds of lives when he first noticed the suspicious package and got the area evacuated. Jewell later successfully sued several news agencies who reported him as the criminal prior to having the facts.

==Unionization==
===Canada===
Many security guards in Canada are unionized. The primary unions which represent security guards in Canada are the [[United Food and Commercial Workers]] (UFCW),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufcw.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=59&amp;Itemid=92&amp;lang=en|title=UFCW Canada - Canada’s  Private Sector Union|website=UFCW Canada - Canada’s  Private Sector Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local 333, and the Canadian branch of the [[United Steelworkers]] (USW). In contrast to the legal restrictions in the United States, Canadian labour relations boards will certify bargaining units of security guards for a [[Canadian Labour Congress]] (CLC)-affiliated union or in the same union with other classifications of employees.

===United States===
In June 1947, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] placing many restrictions on [[labor union]]s. Section 9 (B) (3) of the act prevents the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) from certifying for collective bargaining any unit which mixes security employees with non-security employees. This restricts the ability of security employees to join any union that also represents other types of employees. They may be part of an independent, "security-only" union, not affiliated with any coalition of other types of labor unions such as the [[American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (AFL-CIO). A union which also represents non-security employees may also represent and bargain on behalf of security employees with the employer's consent. Two of the largest security unions are the '''Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America'''(SPFPA) and the '''United Government Security Officers of America'''(UGSOA).

====Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America====
In 1948 with the Taft-Hartley restrictions well into effect, the [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] area security guards of [[United Auto Workers]] (UAW) Amalgamated Local 114 were forced to break away and start a separate "Plant Guards Organizing Committee". The NLRB ruled that as an affiliate of the CIO, the committee was indirectly affiliated with production unions and therefore ineligible for certification under the new restrictions. The committee was then forced to completely withdraw from the CIO and start the independent United Plant Guard Workers of America. By the 1990s, this union had evolved to include many other types of security officers and changed its name to the SPFPA.

====United Government Security Officers of America====
In 1992, the UGSOA was formed. It specializes in organizing federal, state, and local government security officers, but since May, 2000 has been open to representing other types of security personnel as well.

====Others====
The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) has also sought to represent security employees, although its efforts have been complicated by the Taft-Harley Act because the SEIU also represents janitors, trash collectors, and other building service employees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33375">The '''Small Arms Survey''' is an independent research project located at the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. It provides information on all aspects of [[small arms]] and armed violence, as a resource for governments, policy-makers, researchers, and activists, as well as research on small arms issues.

The Survey monitors national and international initiatives (governmental and non-governmental), and acts as a forum and clearinghouse for the sharing of information. It also disseminates best practice measures and initiatives dealing with small arms issues.

The Small Arms Survey mandate is to look at all aspects of small arms and armed violence. It provides research and analysis by which to support governments to [[Armed violence reduction|reduce the incidence of armed violence]] and [[Arms trafficking|illicit trafficking]] through evidence-based analysis.

The project's staff includes international experts in security studies, political science, law, international public policy, development studies, economics, conflict resolution, and sociology. The staff works closely with a worldwide network of researchers and partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallarmssurvey.org |title=Home |publisher=Small Arms Survey |date=2011-06-10 |accessdate=2011-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gpplatform1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpplatform.ch/node/1876 |title=Small Arms Survey &amp;#124; GPPlatform |publisher=Gpplatform.ch |date= |accessdate=2011-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-instraw.org/gtcop/wiki/item/87-the-graduate-institute-geneva-small-arms-survey |title=The Graduate Institute – Geneva; Small Arms Survey |publisher=Un-instraw.org |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2011-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focus projects==

The Small Arms Survey hosts the [[Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development]] Secretariat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/home/topics/peasec/peac/confre/condi.html |title=Diplomatic initiatives |publisher=Eda.admin.ch |date=2008-09-05 |accessdate=2011-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Small Arms Survey's Human Security Baseline Assessment for [[Sudan]] and [[South Sudan]] project supports violence reduction initiatives, including disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration programmes, incentive schemes for civilian arms collections and security sector reform, and arms control interventions across Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallarmssurveysudan.org/ |title=Sudan Human Security Baseline Assessment – Empirical research &amp; support of violence reduction initiatives |publisher=Smallarmssurveysudan.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Security Assessment in North Africa project supports efforts to build a more secure environment in [[North Africa]] and the Sahel-Sahara region. The project produces evidence-based research and analysis on the availability and circulation of small arms, the dynamics of emerging armed groups, and related insecurity. The research stresses the effects of the recent uprisings and armed conflicts in the region on community safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/sana |title=Home |publisher=Small Arms Survey |date=2013-07-25 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2018 report ==

In 2018, Small Arms Survey reported that there are over one billion small arms distributed globally, of which 857 million (about 85 percent) are in [[civilian]] hands.&lt;ref name="smallarmssurvey.org"&gt;http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/de/about-us/highlights/2018/highlight-bp-firearms-holdings.html Small Arms Survey reveals: More than one billion firearms in the world&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/T-Briefing-Papers/SAS-BP-Civilian-Firearms-Numbers.pdf Estimating Global CivilianHELD Firearms Numbers.

=== American gun ownership ===

American civilians own over 393 million guns.

== Criticism ==

The data offered by the Small Arms Survey has several times been denounced as misleading or incorrect. The best known case is the estimation of the amount of firearms in Finland. The number was so high that virtually
every Finnish family should have an illegal firearm at home (on top of all the legal ones) to be true. This number has since then kept popping up as the Small Arms Survey has not corrected it, despite even the Finnish ministry
of interior making a statement that the numbers are completely wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aamulehti.fi/kotimaa/oikaisu-paakirjoituksessa-vaaraa-tietoa-aseiden-maarasta--23546748|title=Oikaisu: Pääkirjoituksessa väärää tietoa aseiden määrästä|date=29 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikkoniskasaari.fi/node/230|title=Miksi "luotettava media" valehtelee asemääristä? - Mikko Niskasaari|website=www.mikkoniskasaari.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another recent example is the inclusion of the misguided Portu operation in their report "From Legal to Lethal: Converted Firearms in Europe". On page 48 they mention it as a seizure involving thousands of readily convertible deactivated firearms, from a militaria store Cantabrico Militaria. However this whole operation was a dismal failure. As there was never question of an illegal operation, and the owners were a few months later released and cleared of the charges. It is even alleged it was a "marketing operation" which had no legal basis and no other purpose but to support the changes to the European firearms directive also known as the "EU Gun Ban". As such this case should not be mentioned in their research as it had nothing to do with illegal trade of firearms or unlawful conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gunsweek.com/en/current/articles/gun-rights-open-fronts-europe|title=Spain: the Cantabrico Militaria ordeal|date=15 November 2017|publisher=gunsweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''socialist state''', '''socialist republic''', or '''socialist country''' (sometimes '''workers' state''' or '''workers' republic''') is a [[Sovereign state|sovereign]] [[State (polity)|state]] [[constitution]]ally dedicated to the establishment of [[socialism]]. The term "[[Communist state]]" is often used interchangeably in the [[Western bloc|West]] specifically when referring to [[single-party]] socialist states governed by [[Marxist-Leninist]] political parties despite being officially socialist states in the process of building socialism; these countries never describe themselves as [[Communism|communist]] nor as having achieved a [[communist society]].&lt;ref name="The Economics of Socialism after World War Two: 1945-1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilczynski|first=J.|title=The Economics of Socialism after World War Two: 1945-1990|publisher=Aldine Transaction|date=2008|isbn=978-0202362281|page=21|quote=Contrary to Western usage, these countries describe themselves as 'Socialist' (not 'Communist'). The second stage (Marx's 'higher phase'), or 'Communism' is to be marked by an age of plenty, distribution according to needs (not work), the absence of money and the market mechanism, the disappearance of the last vestiges of capitalism and the ultimate 'whithering away' of the State.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steele|first=David Ramsay|title=From Marx to Mises: Post Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation |publisher= Open Court|date=September 1999|isbn= 978-0875484495|page=45|quote=Among Western journalists the term 'Communist' came to refer exclusively to regimes and movements associated with the Communist International and its offspring: regimes which insisted that they were not communist but socialist, and movements which were barely communist in any sense at all.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosser|first=Mariana V. and J Barkley Jr.|title=Comparative Economics in a Transforming World Economy|publisher=MIT Press|date=July 23, 2003|isbn=978-0262182348|pages=14|quote=Ironically, the ideological father of communism, Karl Marx, claimed that communism entailed the withering away of the state. The dictatorship of the proletariat was to be a strictly temporary phenomenon. Well aware of this, the Soviet Communists never claimed to have achieved communism, always labeling their own system socialist rather than communist and viewing their system as in transition to communism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a number of countries which are not single-party states based on Marxism-Leninism make reference to socialism in their constitutions; in most cases these are constitutional references alluding to the building of a socialist society that have little to no bearing on the structure and development paths of these countries' political and [[economic system]]s.

The idea of a socialist state stems from the broader notion of [[state socialism]], the political perspective that the working class needs to use state power and government policy to establish a socialist economic system. The concept of a socialist state is mainly advocated by [[Leninists]] and Marxist-Leninists, and most socialist states have been established by political parties adhering to variations of these political ideologies. The concept of a socialist state is considered unnecessary or counterproductive and therefore rejected by some [[Classical Marxism|classical Marxists]], [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] and political thinkers who view the modern state as a byproduct of [[capitalism]] which would therefore have no function in a socialist system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schumpeter|first=Joseph|title=Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy|publisher=Harper Perennial|date=2008|isbn=978-0-06-156161-0|page=169|quote=But there are still others (concepts and institutions) which by virtue of their nature cannot stand transplantation and always carry the flavor of a particular institutional framework. It is extremely dangerous, in fact it amounts to a distortion of historical description, to use them beyond the social world or culture whose denizens they are. Now ownership or property – also, so I believe, taxation – are such denizens of the world of commercial society, exactly as knights and fiefs are denizens of the feudal world. But so is the state (a denizen of commercial society).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian socialists and [[Social anarchism|socialist anarchists]] reject the idea that the state can be used to establish a socialist society due to its hierarchical and arguably coercive nature.

Socialist states in the Marxist-Leninist sense are sovereign states under the control of a [[vanguard party]] which is organizing the country's economic, political and social development toward the realization of socialism. Economically this involves the development of a state capitalist economy with state-directed [[capital accumulation]] with the long-term goal of building up the country's [[productive forces]] while simultaneously promoting [[World communism|worldwide socialist revolution]].&lt;ref name="marxists1989"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-7/lenin-socialism.htm|title=Lenin's Conception of Socialism: Learning from the early experiences of the world's first socialist revolution|author=Richard Fleming|date=|publisher=Forward, Vol. 9, No. 1, Spring/Summer 1989.|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marxists293"&gt;Lenin's [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/cw/volume27.htm Collected Works Vol. 27], p. 293, quoted by [http://www.geocities.com/aufheben2/auf_6_ussr1.html Aufheben] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040318182051/http://www.geocities.com/aufheben2/auf_6_ussr1.html# |date=2004-03-18 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A socialist state is to be distinguished from a [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] [[liberal democracy]] governed by a self-described [[socialist party]], where the state is not constitutionally bound to the construction of socialism. In such cases, the [[political system]] and machinery of government is not specifically structured to pursue the development of socialism.

== Terminology ==
{{see also|Communist state}}

The term "Socialist state" is widely used by Marxist-Leninist parties, theorists, and governments to mean a state under the control of a [[vanguard party]] that is organizing the economic, social, and political affairs of said state toward the construction of socialism. States run by [[Communist parties]] that adhere to Marxism–Leninism, or some variation thereof, refer to themselves as "Socialist states" or "workers' states". They involve the direction of economic development toward the building up of the [[productive forces]] to underpin the establishment of a socialist economy, and usually include that at least the [[commanding heights of the economy]] are nationalized and under [[state ownership]].&lt;ref&gt;C.J. Atkins, 'The Problem of Transition: Development, Socialism and Lenin's NEP', Political Affairs Magazine, April 2009, http://www.politicalaffairs.net/article/articleview/8331/{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} accessed 30/7/09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marxists293"/&gt; This may or may not include the existence of a socialist economy, depending on the specific terminology adopted and level of development in specific countries. For example, the [[Leninist]] definition of a socialist state is a state representing the interests of the working class which presides over a [[state capitalist]] economy structured upon state-directed [[Capital accumulation|accumulation of capital]], with the goal of building up the country's [[productive forces]] and promoting worldwide [[socialist revolution]], with the realization of a socialist economy as the long-term goal.&lt;ref name="marxists293"/&gt;

Because all socialist states operated along Marxist-Leninist principles of governance, the term "Marxist-Leninist state" or "Marxist-Leninist regime" is also used by scholars, particularly when focusing on the political systems of these countries.&lt;ref&gt;Furtak, Robert K. ''Political Systems of the Socialist States: An Introduction to Marxist-Leninist Regimes'', St. Martin's Press, New York, 1986, {{ISBN|978-0745000480}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Western world]], particularly in mass media, journalism and politics, these states and countries are often called "[[Communist state]]s" (though they do not use this term to refer to themselves),
despite the fact that these countries never claimed to have achieved communism in their countries—rather, they claim to be building and working toward the establishment of socialism (and the development towards communism thereafter) in their countries.

== Political theories ==
=== Marxist theory of the state ===
{{see also|Dictatorship of the proletariat}}

[[Karl Marx]] and subsequent thinkers in the [[Marxist]] tradition conceive of the state as representing the interests of the ruling class, partially out of material necessity for the smooth operation of the modes of production it presides over. Marxists trace the formation of the contemporary form of the [[sovereign state]] to the emergence of capitalism as a dominant mode of production, with its organizational precepts and functions designed specifically to manage and regulate the affairs of a capitalist economy. Because this involves governance and laws passed in the interest of the [[bourgeoisie]] as a whole and because government officials either come from the bourgeoisie or are dependent upon their interests, Marx characterized the [[capitalist state]] as a ''[[dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]''. Extrapolating from this, Marx described a post-revolutionary government on the part of the working class or proletariat as a ''[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]'' because the economic interests of the proletariat would have to guide state affairs and policy during a transitional state. Alluding further to the establishment of a socialist and communist economy where [[social ownership]] displaces [[private ownership]], and thus class distinctions on the basis of private property ownership are eliminated, the modern state would have no function and would gradually "whither away" or be transformed into a new form of governance.

Influenced by the pre-Marxist [[Utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] philosopher [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Friedrich Engels]] theorized the nature of the state would change during the transition to socialism. Both Saint-Simon and Engels described a transformation of the state from an entity primarily concerned with political rule over people (via coercion and law creation) to a scientific "administration of things" that would be concerned with directing processes of production in a socialist society, essentially ceasing to be a state.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Saint Simon''; ''Socialism''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Socialism: Utopian and Scientific|website=www.marxists.org|author=Engels, Friedrich|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch01.htm|date=1880|chapter=1|accessdate=12 January 2016|quote=In 1816, he declares that politics is the science of production, and foretells the complete absorption of politics by economics. The knowledge that economic conditions are the basis of political institutions appears here only in embryo. Yet what is here already very plainly expressed is the idea of the future conversion of political rule over men into an administration of things and a direction of processes of production.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Marx never referred to a "Socialist state", he argued that the working class would have to take control of the state apparatus and machinery of government in order to transition out of capitalism and to socialism. The "dictatorship of the proletariat" would represent this transitional state and would involve working class interests dominating government policy in the same manner that capitalist class interests dominate government policy under capitalism (the "[[dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]"). Engels argued that as socialism developed, the state would change in form and function: under socialism it is not a "government of people, but the administration of things", thereby ceasing to be a state by the traditional definition.

One of the most influential modern visions of a transitional state representing proletarian interests was based on the [[Paris Commune]] in which the workers and working poor took control of the city of [[Paris]] in 1871 in reaction to the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Marx described the Paris Commune as the prototype for a revolutionary government of the future, "the form at last discovered" for the emancipation of the proletariat.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, The Civil War in France (1871)&lt;/ref&gt; Engels noted that "all officials, high or low, were paid only the wages received by other workers. [...] In this way an effective barrier to place-hunting and careerism was set up".&lt;ref&gt;Marx, The Civil War in France (1871), 1891 Introduction by Friedrich Engels, 'On the 20th Anniversary of the Paris Commune'&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the nature of the state, Engels continued: "From the outset the Commune was compelled to recognize that the working class, once come to power, could not manage with the old state machine". In order not to be overthrown once having conquered power, Engels argues that the working class "must, on the one hand, do away with all the old repressive machinery previously used against it itself, and, on the other, safeguard itself against its own deputies and officials, by declaring them all, without exception, subject to recall at any moment". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Engels, Friedrich |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/postscript.htm |title=The Civil War in France (1891 Introduction) |publisher=Marxists.org |date=18 March 1891 |accessdate=2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engels argued such a state would be a temporary affair and suggested a new generation brought up in "new and free social conditions" will be able to "throw the entire lumber of the state on the scrap-heap".

=== Reform and revolution ===
Socialists that embraced [[reformism]], exemplified by [[Eduard Bernstein]], took the view that both socialism and a socialist state will gradually evolve out of political reforms won in the by organized socialist political parties and unions: "The socialist movement is everything to me while what people commonly call the goal of Socialism is nothing".&lt;ref&gt;[[Manfred Steger|Steger, Manfred.]] Selected Writings Of Eduard Bernstein, 1920-1921. New Jersey: Humanities Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; These views are considered a "[[Revisionism (Marxism)|revision]]" of Marxist thought.

Following Marx, revolutionary socialists take the view that the working class grows stronger through its battle for reforms (such as in Marx's time the ten-hours bill): {{quote|Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the ever expanding union of the workers. [...] [I]t ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier. It compels legislative recognition of particular interests of the workers, by taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie itself. Thus, the ten-hours' bill in England was carried.|[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]|''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm ''Chapter I. Bourgeois and Proletarians''].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxist]] conception, these battles eventually reach a point where a revolutionary movement arises. A revolutionary movement is required in the view of Marxists to sweep away the capitalist state and the "dictatorship of the bourgeoisie", which must be abolished and replaced with a "dictatorship of the proletariat" in order to being constructing a socialist society: {{quote|In depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat.|Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels|''The Communist Manifesto''&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;}}

In this view, only through revolution can a socialist state be established.

=== Marxist-Leninism theory ===

==== Leninism ====
{{main|Leninism}}

Whereas Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels and [[classical Marxist]] thinkers had little to say about the organization of the state in a socialist society, presuming the modern state to be specific to the capitalist mode of production, [[Vladimir Lenin]] pioneered the idea of a revolutionary state based on his theory of the revolutionary [[Vanguard party]] and organizational principles of [[democratic centralism]]. Adapted to the conditions of semi-feudal Russia, Lenin's concept of the "dictatorship of the proletariat" involved a revolutionary vanguard party acting as representatives of the proletariat and its interests. According to Lenin's [[April Theses]], the goal of the revolution and vanguard party is not the introduction of socialism, which could only be established on a worldwide scale, but to bring production and the state under the control of the [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] of workers' deputies. Following the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, the [[Bolsheviks]] consolidated their power and sought to control and direct the social and economic affairs of the state and broader Russian society in order to safeguard against counterrevolutionary insurrection, foreign invasion and to promote socialist consciousness among the Russian population while simultaneously promoting economic development.&lt;ref name="marxists1989"/&gt;

These ideas were adopted by Lenin in 1917 just prior to the October Revolution in Russia and published in ''[[The State and Revolution]]''. With the failure of the worldwide revolution, or at least European revolution, envisaged by Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]], the [[Russian Civil War]] and finally Lenin's death, war measures that were deemed to be temporary, such as forced requisition of food and the lack of democratic control, became permanent and a tool to boost [[Joseph Stalin]]'s power,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} leading to the emergence of Marxism–Leninism and [[Stalinism]] as well as the notion that [[Socialism in one country|socialism can be created and exist in a single state]].

Lenin argued that as socialism is replaced by communism, the state would "wither away"&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, Vladimir, The State and Revolution, p70, cf, Chapter V, The economic basis for the withering away of the state.&lt;/ref&gt; as strong centralized control progressively reduces as local communities gain more empowerment. As he put succinctly, "[s]o long as the state exists there is no freedom. When there is freedom, there will be no state".

==== Trotskyism ====
{{main|Trotskyism}}

Following [[Joseph Stalin]]'s consolidation of power in the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] and centralization of political power, Leon Trotsky condemned the Soviet government's policies for lacking widespread democratic participation on the part of the population and for suppressing [[Workers' self-management|workers' democratic participation]] in the management of the economy. Because these authoritarian political measures were inconsistent with the organizational precepts of socialism, Trotsky characterized the Soviet Union as a "[[deformed workers' state]]" that would not be able to effectively transition to socialism.

Ostensibly socialist states where democracy is lacking, yet the economy is largely in the hands of the state, are termed by [[Orthodox Trotskyism|orthodox Trotskyist]] theories as "workers' states" and not Socialist states,&lt;ref&gt;Leon Trotsky, ''The Workers’ State, Thermidor and Bonapartism'', (February 1935), New International (New York), Vol.2 No.4, July 1935, ppp.116-122. Trotsky argues that the Soviet Union was, at that time, a "[[deformed workers' state]]" or [[degenerated workers' state]], and not a socialist republic or state, because the "[[Bureaucratic collectivism|bureaucracy wrested the power from the hands of mass organizations]]," thereby necessitating only [[political revolution]] rather than a completely new [[social revolution]], for workers' political control (i.e. state democracy) to be reclaimed.  He argued that it remained, at base, a workers' state because the capitalists and landlords had been expropriated. http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1935/02/ws-therm-bon.htm accessed 30/7/09&lt;/ref&gt; using the terms "[[degenerated workers' state|degenerated]]" or "[[deformed workers' state|deformed]]" workers' states.

at every level of economic and state administration while varying in the degree to which economic planning decisions are delegated to public officials and administrative specialists.

== Characteristics ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2018}}
The political systems of Marxist-Leninist states revolve around the central role of the party which holds ultimate authority. Internally the party practices a form of democracy called [[democratic centralism]].&lt;ref&gt;Furtak, Robert K. ''Political Systems of the Socialist States: An Introduction to Marxist-Leninist Regimes'', St. Martin's Press, New York, 1986, {{ISBN|978-0745000480}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2018}}
The first sovereign state with "Socialist" in its name was the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]] in 1918, which merged with the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]], and [[Transcaucasian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic]] into a single federal union in 1922. The [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] was the first state to proclaim itself a socialist state and proclaim its commitment to building a socialist economy in its [[1936 Soviet Constitution|1936 Constitution]] and a subsequent [[1977 Soviet Constitution|1977 Constitution]]. The Soviet Union was governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] as a single-party state ostensibly with a [[democratic centralism]] organization, with Marxism-Leninism remaining its official guiding ideology until the Soviet Union's dissolution on December 26, 1991. During the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1961, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] announced the completion of socialist construction and declared the optimistic goal of achieving [[Communism in 20 years|communism in 20 years]]. The [[eastern bloc]] was a political and economic bloc of Soviet-aligned socialist states in Eastern and Central Europe which adhered to [[Marxism-Leninism]], Soviet-style governance and a Soviet-style planned economy.

The [[People's Republic of China]] was founded on September 24, 1949, and proclaims itself to be a "Socialist state" in its 1982 [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]].

The [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (North Korea) used to be a Marxist–Leninist state. In 1972, the country adopted a new [[Constitution of North Korea|Constitution]] which changed the official state ideology to ''[[Juche]]'', which is held to be a distinct Korean re-interpretation of the former ideology.&lt;ref name="freemediaproductions.info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemediaproductions.info/Editorials/2009/08/30/juche-is-third-position-ideology-built-on-marx-not-marxist-leninism/ |title=Juche is Third Position ideology built on Marx – Not Marxist-Leninism |publisher=Free Media Productions - Editorials |date=2009-08-30 |accessdate=2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in the [[Lao People's Democratic Republic]], direct references to communism are not included in its founding documents even though it gives direct power to the governing ruling party.

The preamble to the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]]'s [[Constitution of Vietnam|Constitution]] states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between capitalism and socialism after the country was re-unified under the Communist party in 1976&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/ VN Embassy - Constitution of 1992] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709162321/http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/ |date=2011-07-09 }} Full Text. From the Preamble: "On 2 July 1976, the National Assembly of reunified Vietnam decided to change the country's name to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; the country entered a period of transition to socialism, strove for national construction, and unyieldingly defended its frontiers while fulfilling its internationalist duty."&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Constitution of Cuba|1992 Constitution]] of the [[Republic of Cuba]] states that the role of the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist Party]] is to "guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism (and the progress toward a communist society)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm Cubanet - Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, 1992] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709122434/http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm |date=2011-07-09 }} Full Text. From Article 5: "The Communist Party of Cuba, a follower of Martí’s ideas and of Marxism–Leninism, and the organized vanguard of the Cuban nation, is the highest leading force of society and of the state, which organizes and guides the common effort toward the goals of the construction of socialism and the progress toward a communist society,"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constitutional references to socialism ==
{{see also|Socialism in liberal democratic constitutions}}
A number of countries make reference to socialism in their constitutions that are not single-party states embracing Marxism-Leninism and planned economies. In most cases these are constitutional references to the building of a socialist society and political principles that have little to no bearing on the structure and guidance of these country's [[machinery of government]] and [[economic system]].

The preamble to the 1976 [[Constitution of Portugal]] states that the Portuguese state has as one of its goals opening "the way to socialist society".&lt;ref&gt;The Preamble to the 1976 Constitution of Portugal stated: "The Constituent Assembly affirms the Portuguese people's decision to defend their national independence, safeguard the fundamental rights of citizens, establish the basic principles of democracy, secure the primacy of the rule of law in a democratic state, and open the way to socialist society." [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/po00000_.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

India, Algeria, Congo Brazaville and Sri Lanka have directly used the term "socialist" in their official constitution and name, respectively.

Poland and Hungary directly denounce "Communism" in their founding documents in reference to their past regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/pl__indx.html|title=ICL - Poland Index|first=Prof. Dr. Axel Tschentscher,|last=LL.M.|website=www.servat.unibe.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/hr__indx.html|title=ICL - Croatia Index|first=Prof. Dr. Axel Tschentscher,|last=LL.M.|website=www.servat.unibe.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In these cases, the intended meaning of "socialism" can vary widely and sometimes the constitutional references to socialism are left over from a previous period in the country's history. In the case of many Middle Eastern states, "socialism" was often used in reference to an [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]]/[[Arab nationalism|nationalist]] philosophy adopted by specific regimes, such as that of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and that of the various [[Ba'ath Party|Ba'ath Parties]].

Examples of countries directly using the word "socialist" in their names include the [[Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka]] and the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] while a number of countries make references to socialism in their constitutions, but not in their names. These include [[India]]&lt;ref&gt;The Preamble of the Constitution of India reads : "We, the people of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, republic..." See [[Preamble to the Constitution of India]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Portugal]]. In the constitutions of [[Hungary]], [[Poland]] and [[Croatia]], direct condemnation is made to the respective, past socialist regimes. The [[autonomous region]] of [[Rojava]], which operates under the principles of [[democratic confederalism]], has been described as a socialist state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Derek Wall |url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-fe30-Rojava-a-beacon-of-hope-fighting-Isis |title=Rojava: a beacon of hope fighting Isis |newspaper=Morning Star |date=2014-08-25 |accessdate=2015-12-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105163107/http://morningstaronline.co.uk/a-fe30-Rojava-a-beacon-of-hope-fighting-Isis# |archive-date=2016-01-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, countries like [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Belarus]], [[Colombia]] and [[Russia]] use the varied term "[[social state]]", leaving a more ambiguous meaning.

== Other uses ==
In the post-war period when nationalisation of large industries was relatively widespread, it was not uncommon for commentators to describe some European countries as "Socialist states" seeking to move their countries toward a socialist economy.

In 1956, for example, leading British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician and author [[Anthony Crosland]] claimed that capitalism had been abolished in Britain, although others—such as Welshman [[Aneurin Bevan]], Minister of Health in the first [[Attlee ministry|post-war Labour government]]—disputed the claim that Britain was a socialist state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |date=January 1958 |title=The Managerial Society Part Three — Fabian Version |url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/1950s/1958/no-641-january-1958/managerial-society-part-three-—-fabian-version |journal=Socialist Standard |issue=641|location= |publisher=The Socialist Party of Great Britain |access-date=31 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crosland, Anthony, The Future of Socialism, pp.9, 89. Constable (2006); Bevan, Aneurin, In place of Fear.&lt;/ref&gt; For Crosland and others who supported his views, Britain was a socialist state. For Bevan, Britain had a socialist [[National Health Service]] which stood in opposition to the hedonism of Britain's capitalist society. He stated: {{quote|The National Health service and the Welfare State have come to be used as interchangeable terms, and in the mouths of some people as terms of reproach. Why this is so it is not difficult to understand, if you view everything from the angle of a strictly individualistic competitive society. A free health service is pure Socialism and as such it is opposed to the hedonism of capitalist society.|[[Aneurin Bevan]]&lt;ref&gt;''In Place of Fear'', p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] was in power in France in the post-war period, some commentators{{Who|date=September 2010}} claimed that France was a socialist country, although as in the rest of Europe the [[Capital accumulation|laws of capitalism]] still operated fully and private enterprises dominated the economy. In the 1980s, the [[François Mitterrand]] government aimed to expand [[dirigisme|dirigism]] and scheduled to nationalize all banks, but this attempt faced opposition of the [[European Economic Community]]. The same is now applied to [[Nordic countries]] with the [[Nordic model]].

== Controversy with the term ==
A variety of non-[[state socialist]] positions—such as [[social anarchism]], [[libertarian socialism]] and [[council communism]]—reject the concept of a "Socialist state" altogether, believing that the modern state is a byproduct of capitalism and cannot be used for the establishment of a socialist system. They reason that a "Socialist state" is antithetical to socialism and that socialism will emerge spontaneously from the [[grassroots]] level in an [[Evolutionary economics|evolutionary manner]], developing its own unique political and economic institutions for a highly organized [[stateless society]]. [[Anarcho-communist]]s likewise reject the concept of a "Socialist state" for being antithetical to socialism, but they believe that socialism—and thus communism—can only be established through [[revolution]].

Within the [[History of socialism|socialist movement]], a number of criticisms are maintained towards the use of the term "Socialist states" in relation to countries such as China and previously of Soviet Union and Eastern and Central European states before what some term the "collapse of [[Stalinism]]" in 1989. [[Democratic socialism|Democratic socialists]], [[Left communism|left communists]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.internationalism.org/node/609|title=4. STATE CAPITALISM - International Communist Current|website=en.internationalism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarchism|anarchists]] and some [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Tony Cliff]], for example. See [http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/ Tony Cliff's Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; claim that the so-called "Socialist states" or "people's states" actually presided over [[state capitalist]] economies and thus cannot be called "socialist".

Other Trotskyists, while agreeing that these states could not be described as socialist, deny that they were state capitalist.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [[Peter Taaffe]]: "The Soviet bureaucracy and Western capitalism rested on mutually antagonistic social systems", ''The Rise of Militant'', Chapter 34, Russia, ''Trotsky and the Collapse of Stalinism''.&lt;/ref&gt; They support Trotsky's analysis of (pre-restoration) Soviet Union as a workers' state that had [[Degenerated workers' state|degenerated]] into a "monstrous" bureaucratic dictatorship which rested on a largely nationalized industry run according to a plan of production and claimed that the former Stalinist states of Central and Eastern Europe were [[deformed workers' state]]s based on the same relations of production as the Soviet Union.

Certain other countries simply use the self-defining term "social state" in their founding documents which are open to interpretation.

'''Thomas Titus Nkobi''' (born 22 October 1922 in Southern [[Matabeleland]], died 25 September 1994 in [[Johannesburg]] / South Africa) was a senior leader of the South African [[African National Congress|African National Congress (ANC)]] and a key figure in the [[apartheid|Anti-Apartheid]] movement. Until his death he was the Treasurer General of the ANC and also its Member of Parliament.

==Life==
Thomas Titus Nkobi ("Comrade T.G.") was born on 22 October 1922 in [[Plumtree, Zimbabwe|Plumtree]], [[Matabeleland South]], [[Southern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]). He grew up and was educated in South Africa, where his father was working in the mines as a migrant labourer. He was at [[Adams College]] of Education in [[KwaZulu Natal]] with [[Joshua Nkomo]], the Zimbabwean Vice-President and [[Bernard Chidzero]], the Zimbabwean Minister of Finance and Dr. [[Ntsu Mokhehle]], the Prime Minister of [[Lesotho]]. After completing High School in Natal he matriculated from Bantu High School (later Madibane High School) in Western Township, Johannesburg in 1946 and went to [[National University of Lesotho|Roma College (now National University of Lesotho)]] in Lesotho, pursuing a [[Bachelor of Commerce]] degree.

His initial political involvement against the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|Apartheid regime]] started in 1944 during the [[Alexandra, Gauteng|Alexandra]] bus boycott, a non-violent protest campaign. In 1950 he formally joined the [[African National Congress|ANC]] and played a leading role in the 1952 ANC [[Defiance Campaign|Defiance Campaign against Unjust Laws]]. He was one of the main volunteers who travelled from village to village collecting demands of the African population that were incorporated into the ANC [[Freedom Charter]]; he attended the 1955 [[Congress of the People (1955)|Congress of the People]] in [[Kliptown]] that drew up the Freedom Charter as a delegate from Alexandra.

In 1957 Thomas Nkobi shot to prominence when he chaired the Second Alexandra Peoples Transport Committee which was co-ordinating a bus boycott in the Johannesburg and [[Pretoria]] [[Township (South Africa)|townships]] following a 25 per cent increase in bus fares. In the same year he was arrested for participating in the nationwide [[South African Potato Boycott]], following The Farm Labour Scandal, a journalistic investigation by [[Ruth First]] and [[Joe Gqabi]], which uncovered that Africans arrested for infringement of the [[pass laws]] were coerced into enforced labour on potato farms. In 1958 Thomas Nkobi became the National Organizer of the ANC and was charged with the task of implementing the M-Plan, an action plan, named after [[Nelson Mandela]], to decentralise the ANCs organizational branches and communication channels to avoid public meetings and announcements and increase effectiveness of their political and social campaign.

During the 1960 [[State of Emergency]], he was amongst the thousands of political activists who were detained. After his release he continued working for the ANC as National Organizer and was also prominent in the underground. He was [[banned]] in 1961, and in 1962 placed under a 24-hour house arrest. In 1963 Thomas Nkobi fled South Africa for exile in [[Dar es Salaam]] / [[Tanzania]] and later [[Lusaka]] / [[Zambia]], where he became actively involved in mobilising international public opinion against the Apartheid regime.

From 1968 to 1973 he served as deputy to then [[Treasurer|Treasurer General]] of the ANC, [[Moses Kotane]]. He was elected Treasurer General of the ANC in 1973, a post to which he was re-elected at all subsequent national conferences of the organisation.

After the ANC was in legalised in 1990 he returned to South Africa. There he oversaw the ANCs budget for South Africa's first democratic election, which brought the ANC to power. Thomas Nkobi was re-elected as Treasurer General in party elections in 1991 and also elected as Member of Parliament, member of the ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) and member of the ANC's National Working Committee (NWC); one of several elders with moderate views who retained leadership positions.

He died on 25 September 1994, in Johannesburg after suffering a fatal stroke. He is buried at Heroes' Acre in Soweto, a section of Soweto's [[Avalon Cemetery]] reserved as final resting place for many Anti-Apartheid activists.

In 2004, Thomas Nkobi posthumously received the [[Order of Luthuli| Order of Luthuli in Gold]] for his "exceptional and selfless contribution to the struggle for a non-racial, non-sexist, free and democratic South Africa".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24017">The '''United Nations Regional Groups''' are the geopolitical regional groups of [[Member states of the United Nations|member states]] of the [[United Nations]]. Originally,  UN member states were  unofficially grouped into five geopolitical regional groups. What began as an informal means of sharing the distribution of posts for General Assembly committees has taken on a much more expansive role. Depending on the UN context, regional groups control elections to UN-related positions, on the basis of geographic representation, as well as coordinate substantive policy, and form common fronts for negotiations and voting.

{{legend|#000000|UN member not in any voting group}}
{{legend|#00ff00|Observer states}}
{{legend|#c0c0c0|Disputed territory}}]]

The groupings have changed over time. From the founding of the United Nations until 1966, the regional groups were: [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Asia]], [[Latin America]], [[Middle East]] and [[Western Europe]]. In 1966, in response to changes in the UN's membership, decolonisation and strategic realignment, the groups were reorganised as: Asia, Eastern Europe, Africa, Latin America and Caribbean, and Western Europe and Others. In 2011, the Asia Group was renamed Asia-Pacific.

As of May 2014, 192 of the 193 UN member states are divided into five regional groups:&lt;ref name="list"&gt;[https://www.un.org/depts/DGACM/RegionalGroups.shtml United Nations Regional Groups of Member States], 9 May 2014, accessed 28 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

* the [[African Group]], with 54 member states
* the [[#Asia-Pacific Group|Asia-Pacific Group]], with 53 member states
* the [[Eastern European Group]], with 23 member states
* the [[Latin American and Caribbean Group]] (GRULAC), with 33 member states
* the [[Western European and Others Group]] (WEOG), with 28 member states, plus 1 member state (the [[United States]]) as an observer state.

[[Kiribati]] is not included in any of the above-mentioned regional groups (see below for more details).

==Overview==
Apart from allowing member states with related international interests to liaise, discuss and coordinate their voting and other activities at the United Nations, the main function of the regional groups is to distribute membership quotas in United Nations bodies and leadership positions. According to convention, the non-permanent membership seats of the [[United Nations Security Council]] is apportioned between regional groups according to a set formula. Other bodies, such as the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] and the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]], also have set membership quotas for each regional group. The position of the [[President of the United Nations General Assembly]] rotates amongst the groups on a ten-year cycle (the current rule being that each regional group fills the position twice during the cycle, in effect it rotates on a five-year cycle).

==The regional groups==
===African Group===
{{Main|African Group}}

The [[Africa|African]] Group has 54 members (28% of all UN members), and is thus the largest regional group by number of member states. It is the only regional group that has a territory that coincides with the traditional [[continent]] of which its name originates. The African Group has 3 seats on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]], all non-permanent. The Group also has 14 seats on the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] and 13 seats on the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]]. In the rotation of the post of the [[President of the United Nations General Assembly|President]] of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], the group is eligible for having its nationals elected to this post in years ending with 4 and 9; most recently, [[Sam Kutesa]] of [[Uganda]] was elected to this position in 2014.

====2011 name change====
Until 2011, the Asia-Pacific Group was called the "Asian Group".&lt;ref name = asiapacific&gt;[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=62791 "Asian group of nations at UN changes its name to Asia-Pacific group"], ''Radio New Zealand International'', 2011-08-31.&lt;/ref&gt; The name change was adopted as a result of pressure from the non-Asian island countries that compose approximately one-fifth of the group's membership.&lt;ref name = asiapacific/&gt; On China's insistence, the group's official name is the "Group of Asia and the Pacific Small Island Developing States", but the use of the shortened name "Asia-Pacific Group" is permitted in official UN documents.&lt;ref name = asiapacific/&gt;

===Eastern European Group===
{{Main|Eastern European Group}}

The [[Eastern Europe|Eastern European]] Group has 23 members (12% of all UN members), and as such is the regional group with the fewest member states. The Eastern European Group has 2 seats on the [[Security Council]]: [[Russia]]'s permanent seat and one non-permanent seat. The Group also has 6 seats on the United Nations Economic and Social Council and 6 seats on the United Nations Human Rights Council. In the rotation of the post of the President of the United Nations General Assembly, the group is eligible for having its nationals elected to this post in years ending with 2 and 7; most recently, [[Vuk Jeremić]] of the [[Serbia|Republic of Serbia]] was elected to this position for 2012.

The [[Latin America|Latin American]] and [[Caribbean]] Group (GRULAC for short&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC)|url=http://www.cancilleria.gov.co/en/international/multilateral/consensus/latin-america|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Colombia|accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) has 33 members (17% of all UN members). Its territory is almost exactly that of [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]] and the Caribbean; the differences arise from the presence of dependent territories of European countries. GRULAC has 2 non-permanent seats on the [[Security Council]]. The Group also has 10 seats on the United Nations Economic and Social Council and 8 seats on the United Nations Human Rights Council. In the rotation of the post of the President of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], the group is eligible for having its nationals elected to this post in years ending with 3 and 8; most recently, [[John William Ashe]] of [[Antigua and Barbuda]] was elected to this position in 2013.

===Special cases===
====Israel====
In May 2000, [[Israel]], though naturally a part of the Asia-Pacific Group in geographical terms but with membership blocked{{how?|date=June 2017}} by Arab {{which?|date=June 2017}} countries became a full member of WEOG, on a temporary basis (subject to renewal), in WEOG's headquarters in the US, thereby enabling it to put forward candidates for election to various UN General Assembly bodies. In 2004 Israel obtained a permanent renewal to its membership.&lt;ref&gt;UN Commission for Human Rights, Resolution 624.&lt;/ref&gt; (It remained an observer at UN offices in Geneva, Nairobi, Rome and Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.case.edu/orgs/jil/vol.41.2.3/41_Gruenberg.pdf Justin Gruenberg: ''An Analysis of United Nations Security Council Resolutions''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610063041/http://www.case.edu/orgs/jil/vol.41.2.3/41_Gruenberg.pdf |date=2010-06-10 }} (p. 479, n. 68).&lt;/ref&gt;) In December 2013, Israel was granted full membership to the WEOG group in [[Geneva]]. Israel is thus a full permanent member of the WEOG group.

====Kiribati====
As of 2010, [[Kiribati]] (geographically in Oceania) has never been elected to be a member of any regional group,&lt;ref name="list"/&gt; despite other Oceania nations belonging to the Asia-Pacific Group. Despite its membership in the United Nations, Kiribati has never delegated a permanent representative to the UN.

====Turkey====
[[Turkey]] participates fully in both WEOG and Asia-Pacific Group, but for electoral purposes is considered a member of WEOG only.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/depts/DGACM/RegionalGroups.shtml United Nations Regional Groups of Member States].&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States of America====

However, it is considered to be a member of WEOG for putting forward candidates for electoral purposes in the United Nations General Assembly.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;[http://www.unhabitat.org/downloads/docs/GRHS.2007.7.pdf ''UN-HABITAT's Global Report on Human Settlements'', 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515020458/http://www.unhabitat.org/downloads/docs/GRHS.2007.7.pdf |date=May 15, 2011 }} (p. 335, n. 2).

==Proposed new groupings==
===Pacific===
In 2000, the government of [[Nauru]]—at present, a member of the Asia-Pacific Group—called for a new regional group titled [[Oceania]]. Aside from Nauru, this proposed bloc may also include [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] (both in the WEOG), [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], the [[Member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN countries]], and the rest of [[Oceania#region|Oceania]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/webcast/statements/nauruE.htm See UN official website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3282">[[File:Upper Ten Thousand, 1845.jpg|thumb|A reprint of the paragraph in which [[Nathaniel Parker Willis]] coined the term, 1845]]
'''Upper Ten Thousand''', or simply, ''The Upper Ten'', is a 19th-century phrase referring to wealthiest 10,000 residents of [[New York City]]. The phrase was coined in 1844 by American poet and author [[Nathaniel Parker Willis]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Irving Lewis. ''The City in Slang: New York Life and Popular Speech''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993: 222. {{ISBN|0-19-507591-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, the term came to be used to describe the upper circles not only of New York, but also those of other major cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bartlett|first=John Russell|year=1859|title=Dictionary of Americanisms, 2nd ed. enlarged|place=Boston|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|page=494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usages==
In 1852, [[Charles Astor Bristed]] published a collection of sketches on New York Society entitled "The Upper Ten Thousand" in ''Fraser Magazine''. In 1854, [[George Lippard]] serialized his book ''New York: Its Upper Ten and Lower Million''. The phrase also appeared in British fiction in ''[[The Adventures of Philip]]'' (1861–62) by [[William Makepeace Thackeray|William Thackeray]], whose eponymous hero contributed weekly to a fashionable New York journal entitled “The Gazette of the Upper Ten Thousand”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tillotson|first=Geoffrey|year=1995|title=William Thackeray: The Critical Heritage|place=New York|publisher=Routledge|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The general acceptance of the term seems to be attested by its use in the title of Edward Abbott's 1864 cookery book, ''[[The English and Australian Cookery Book]]: Cookery for the Many as Well as the 'Upper Ten Thousand'''.

In 1875, both Adam Bissett Thom and Kelly's Directory published books entitled ''The Upper Ten Thousand'', which listed members of the aristocracy, the gentry, officers in the British Army and Navy, members of Parliament, Colonial administrators, and members of the [[Church of England]]. The usage of this term was a response to the broadening of the British [[ruling class]] which had been caused by the [[Industrial Revolution]].

Most of the people listed in ''Kelly's Handbook to the Upper Ten Thousand'' were among the 30,000 descendants of [[Edward III, King of England]], tabulated in the [[Marquis of Ruvigny and Raineval]]'s ''Plantagenet Roll of the Blood Royal''.&lt;ref&gt;London: T. C. &amp; E. C. Jack, 1903&lt;/ref&gt; Most also appeared in Walford's ''[[Walford's County Families|County Families]]'' and Burke's ''[[landed gentry#Burke's Landed Gentry|Landed Gentry]]''.

[[File:Mohammad Hatta 1950.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Mohammad Hatta]], the first Vice-President of Indonesia]]

The '''Vice President of the Republic of Indonesia''' ({{lang-id|Wakil Presiden Republik Indonesia}}) is the first in the line of succession in the [[Indonesia|Republic of Indonesia]].

==History of the office==
The Indonesian Vice Presidency was established during the formulation of the 1945 constitution by the [[Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence]] (BPUPKI). The office was first filled on 18 August 1945 when [[Mohammad Hatta]] was elected by acclamation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mail-archive.com/rantaunet@googlegroups.com/msg02583.html [EMAIL PROTECTED&amp;#93; Dr. Muhammad Hatta&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The election was conducted by the Committee for the Preparation of Indonesian Independence (PPKI) because the body responsible for the Vice-Presidential elections, the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] (MPR), had not been formed yet. In the early days of the Republic, the office of Vice-President showed how important it can be. On 16 October 1945, Hatta announced a Vice-Presidential decree which turned the Central National Committee of Indonesia (KNIP) equal status with that of the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.transparansi.or.id/kajian/kajian10/bab_I.html |title=Usulan MTI tentang Amandemen UUD 1945&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=12 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601153212/http://www.transparansi.or.id/kajian/kajian10/bab_I.html |archive-date=1 June 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this decree, the KNIP was able to separate the role of [[Head of State]] and [[Head of Government]] on 11 November 1945. Although a new constitution had not been set up yet, Indonesia was now a [[de facto]] Parliamentary Democracy.

During the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], both Hatta and Sukarno were captured by the Dutch in [[Yogyakarta]] on 18 December 1948. Together with Sukarno, Hatta gave mandate for [[Syafruddin Prawiranegara]] to form an emergency Government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mail-archive.com/urangawak@yahoogroups.com/msg01229.html [Urangawak&amp;#93; Peran PDRI Akhirnya Diakui&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011014520/http://www.mail-archive.com/urangawak@yahoogroups.com/msg01229.html |date=11 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done and the Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PDRI) was formed in Sumatra with Prawiranegara as Chairman. Prawiranegara handed back his mandate to Sukarno and consequently, to Hatta on 13 July 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0208/16/opini/meng27.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050316075544/http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0208/16/opini/meng27.htm |archive-date=16 March 2005 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now officially an independent nation, Indonesia adopted the Provisional Constitution, a document which defined the President's role as a ceremonial Head of State whose role was to appoint a Prime Minister on the advice of formateurs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sjdih.depkeu.go.id/fulltext/1950/UUDSTAHUN~1950UUDS.HTM&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Vice Presidency continued to exist, the form of Government was now officially a Parliamentary Democracy and there was not a significant role for the Vice-President to play. On 1 December 1956, partly because of his differences with Sukarno, Hatta resigned from the Vice Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mail-archive.com/palanta@minang.rantaunet.org/msg19878.html [EMAIL PROTECTED&amp;#93; Mengenang Mundurnya Bung Hatta&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next 17 years, the Vice Presidency remain vacant. In December 1965, there were calls for a Vice-President to be named to assist President Sukarno during the times of uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hughes |first= John |title= The End of Sukarno: A Coup That Misfired: A Purge That Ran Wild |origyear= 1967 |edition= 3rd |year= 2002 |publisher= Archipelago Press |location= Singapore |isbn=981-4068-65-9 |pages= 215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea did not gain momentum and the Vice Presidency continued to remain vacant as the Presidency passed over from Sukarno to General [[Suharto]].

In March 1973, the Vice Presidency vacancy was filled by [[Hamengkubuwono IX]] when he was elected by the MPR. After Hamengkubuwono IX and throughout the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]], the Vice Presidency were successively held by [[Adam Malik]], [[Umar Wirahadikusumah]], [[Sudharmono]], [[Try Sutrisno]], and [[BJ Habibie]]. During his time as President, Suharto would reduce the Vice Presidency to a sinecure. A Vice-President was reduced to making sure that Government policy was being implemented and attending ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.ohiou.edu/indopubs/2001/01/20/0011.html [INDONESIA-NEWS&amp;#93; KMP - Asal-Usul dengan Bondan Winar&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Vice-President did not even take on Presidential duties when Suharto was either out of the country or ill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hamline.edu/apakabar/basisdata/1998/01/04/0001.html [INDONESIA-L&amp;#93; TI - Wapres Hanya Ban&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060917183936/http://www.hamline.edu/apakabar/basisdata/1998/01/04/0001.html |date=17 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The office would derogatorily be known as ''Ban Serep'' (Spare Tire). Despite being a largely figurehead role, the Vice Presidency twice became a source of controversy with Sudharmono having to face various obstacles en route to being Vice-President in 1988 and Try being preemptively nominated in 1993.

With Suharto's fall in May 1998 and Habibie's accession to the Presidency, the Vice Presidency once again became vacant. In October 1999, [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] was elected as Vice-President and the office began to gain significance. Megawati was delegated genuine tasks to do &lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/jan2000/ind-j10.shtml Fighting in the Malukus heightens tensions across Indonesia and within the Wahid cabinet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2000, she even became responsible for the day-to-day running of the Government.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

During the 2001 MPR Annual Session, it was finally decided that from 2004 onwards, the Vice-President, together with the President, will directly be elected by the people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/indonesian/archive/2001-11/a-2001-11-06-1-1.cfm MPR Dan Pemilihan Presiden Langsung - 2001-11-06&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825164529/http://www.voanews.com/indonesian/archive/2001-11/a-2001-11-06-1-1.cfm |date=25 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The substantial role that the Vice Presidency is now going to have was evident in the way in which the 2004 Presidential Candidates chose their [[running mate]]s. At the end, [[Jusuf Kalla]] became Indonesia's first directly elected Vice-President.

'''Oath of Office of the Vice-President of the Republic of Indonesia''' : "I swear by Allah to fulfill the duties of President (Vice President) of the Republic of Indonesia to the best of my capabilities and in the fairest way possible, to uphold the Constitution by all means and to execute all laws and regulations as straightforwardly as possible as well as to dedicate myself to the service of the Nation and the People."

'''Pledge of Office of the Vice-President of the Republic of Indonesia''' : "I solemnly pledge to fulfill the duties of President (Vice President) of the Republic of Indonesia to the best of my capabilities and in the fairest way possible, to uphold the Constitution by all means and to execute all laws and regulations as straightforwardly as possible as well as to dedicate myself to the service of the Nation and the People."

===Powers===
None specified by all constitutions. The convention has been for the President to delegate a task for the Vice-President to do.

===Line of Succession and Impeachment===
'''The 1945 Constitution''': The Vice-President replaces the President in the event that the President dies, resigns, or is unable to perform his/her duties for any reason.

'''The Provisional Constitution''': The Vice-President replaces the President in the event that the President dies, resigns, or is unable to perform his/her duties for any reason.

'''The Amended 1945 Constitution''': The Vice-President replaces the President in the event that the President dies, resigns, or is unable to perform his/her duties for any reason. If the President and the Vice-President dies, resigns, or is unable to perform his/her duties for any reason, the government will be taken over together by Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Internal Affairs and Minister of Defence. Then the MPR will elect a new president from the two candidates nominated by the political parties whose candidates are the winner and the runner-up in the past presidential election. If the Vice Presidency becomes vacant with the President still holding office, the President nominates two candidates and the MPR has to elect a new Vice-President out of the candidates within 60 days.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.detik.com/read/2010/01/22/184420/1284302/10/wapres-bisa-jadi-presiden-kemudian-memilih-wakilnya?nd771108bcj&lt;/ref&gt; Under the amended constitution, the Vice-President can now be impeached and removed from office. If the Vice-President is viewed to be unfit to perform his duties and has committed crimes such as corruption and betraying the Nation, the DPR can appeal to the Supreme Court to try the Vice-President. Furthermore, the DPR can ask the Constitutional Court to look into the matter, during which it has 90 days to make a decision. With the decision made, the DPR can motion for the MPR to convene. The Vice-President would then be given one last chance to defend himself before the MPR makes the decision whether or not the Vice-President should be impeached.

===Post-Vice Presidency===
Law 7 of 1978 &lt;ref&gt;http://kambing.vlsm.org/bebas/v01/RI/uu/1978/uu-1978-007.txt&lt;/ref&gt; stipulates that former Vice-Presidents are entitled to a pension. Former Presidents are also entitled to a house with electricity, water, and telephone bills covered by the Government. In addition to that Former Vice-Presidents will have free healthcare for his family and a car with chauffeur.

'''Westernization''' ([[American English|US]]) or '''Westernisation''' ([[British English|UK]]), also '''[[Europeanization]]/[[Europeanisation]]''' or '''occidentalization'''/'''occidentalisation''' (from ''the Occident'', meaning the [[Western world]]; see [[wikt:Occident|"occident" in the dictionary]]), is a process whereby [[Society|societies]] come under or adopt [[Western culture]] in areas such as [[industry]], [[technology]], [[law]], [[politics]], [[economics]], [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[clothing]], [[language]], [[alphabet]], [[religion]], [[Western philosophy|philosophy]], and [[western culture|values]].&lt;ref&gt;Thong, Tezenlo. "‘To Raise the Savage to a Higher Level:' The Westernization of Nagas and Their Culture," ''Modern Asian Studies'' 46, no. 4 (July 2012): 893–918&lt;/ref&gt; Westernization has been an accelerating influence across the world in the last few centuries, with some thinkers assuming Westernization to be the equivalent of [[Modernization theory|modernization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayford|first=Charles|title=Westernization|url=|work=in David Pong, ed., Encyclopedia of Modern China|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a way of thought that is often debated. The overall process of Westernization is often two-sided in that Western influences and interests themselves are joined with parts of the affected society, at minimum, to change towards a more Westernized society, in the hope of attaining a Western life or some aspects of it, while Western societies are themselves affected by this process and interaction with non-Western groups.

Westernization traces it roots back to [[Ancient Greece]]. Later, the [[Roman Empire]] would take on the first process of Westernization as it was heavily influenced by Greece and created a new culture based on the principles and values of the Ancient Greek society. The Romans emerged with a culture that would lay the new foundations of Europe and create the new western identity based on the Greco-Roman society.

Westernization can also be compared to [[acculturation]] and [[enculturation]]. Acculturation is "the process of cultural and psychological change that takes place as a result of contact between cultural groups and their individual members."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acculturation|url=|work=Encyclopedia of Applied Psychology|publisher=Oxford: Elsevier Science &amp; Technology|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After contact, changes in cultural patterns are evident within ''one'' or ''both'' cultures. Specific to Westernization and the non-Western culture, foreign societies tend to adopt changes in their own social systems relative to Western ideology, lifestyle, and physical appearance, along with numerous other aspects, and shifts in culture patterns can be seen to take root as a community becomes acculturated to Western customs and characteristics – in other words, Westernized. Westernization can include [[Christianization]],
[[Americanisation]] and [[Europeanisation]], with historical versions including [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanisation]], [[Hellenisation]], [[Francisation]], and [[Germanisation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The phenomenon of Westernization does not follow any one specific pattern across societies as the degree of adaption and fusion with Western customs will occur at varying magnitudes within different [[communities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLeish|first=Kenneth|title=Westernization|url=|work=Bloomsbury Guide to Human Thought|publisher=Bloomsbury, London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the extent to which domination, destruction, resistance, survival, adaptation or modification affect a native culture may differ following inter-ethnic contact.&lt;ref&gt;Kottak, Conrad Phillip. (2005). Window on Humanity. New York: McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
===Countries part of the West===
{{Main|Western world}}

The "West" was originally defined as the [[Western world]]. Ancient Romans distinguished between Oriental (Eastern, or Asian) cultures that inhabited present-day [[Egypt]] and Occidental cultures that lived in the West. A thousand years later, the [[East-West Schism]] separated the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] from each other. The definition of Western changed as the West was influenced by and spread to other nations. Islamic and Byzantine scholars added to the [[Western canon]] when their stores of Greek and Roman literature jump-started the [[Renaissance]]. Although Russia converted to [[Christianity]] in the 10th century, the West expanded to include it fully when [[Peter the Great]] deeply [[Government reform of Peter the Great|reformed the country's government]], [[Church reform of Peter the Great|the church]] and modernised the society thanks to the ideas brought from the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econc10.bu.edu/economic_systems/NatIdentity/FSU/Russia/Westernization.html|title=The Westernization of Russia and the Intelligentsia|website=econc10.bu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, most modern uses of the term refer to the societies in the West and their close [[genealogical]], [[natural language|linguistic]], and [[philosophical]] descendants, typically included are those countries whose ethnic identity and dominant culture are derived from [[Culture of Europe|European culture]]. However, though sharing in similar historical background, it would be incorrect to regard the Western world as a monolithic bloc, as many cultural, linguistic, religious, political, and economical differences exist between Western countries and populations.

Western civilization is commonly said to include [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[European Union member states|European Union]] (and at least the [[EFTA]] countries, [[Microstates and the European Union|European microstates]]), [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Questions about immigrant-related statistics |url=http://www.ssb.no/en/innvandring-og-innvandrere/nokkeltall |title=Key figures Immigration and immigrants – SSB |publisher=Ssb.no|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssb.no/befolkning/statistikker/innvbef/aar Innvandrere og norskfødte med innvandrerforeldre, 1. januar 2015] Statistics Norway {{no icon}} retrieved 15 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition is often widened, and can include these countries, or a combination of these countries:
*'''[[Europe]]an countries outside of the [[European Union|EU]] and [[EFTA]]''' – Due to sharing of the general [[European culture]] and [[Christian faith]], these countries are included in the definition of the West. 
*'''[[Latin America]]'''. Some countries in Latin America are considered Western countries, largely because most of its peoples are descended from Europeans (Spanish and Portuguese settlers and later immigration from other European nations). And thus their society operates in a highly Westernized way. Indeed, most countries in Latin America use their official language, either in [[Spanish Language|Spanish]] or [[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]]. According to the ''CIA World Factbook'', there has also been considerable immigration to Latin America from European nations other than [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] (for example, from [[Germany]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], etc.—see [[Immigration to Argentina]], [[Immigration to Brazil]], [[Immigration to Uruguay]] or [[Immigration to Chile]]).&lt;ref name=CIAEG&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2075.html |title= CIA – The World Factbook – Field Listing – Ethnic groups |accessdate=2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Countries significantly influenced by Westernization===
The process of Westernization comes when non-Western societies come under Western influence or adopt Western culture in different areas such as industry, technology, law, politics, economics, lifestyle, diet, clothing, language, alphabet, religion, philosophy, and values.&lt;ref&gt;Thong, Tezenlo. "‘To Raise the Savage to a Higher Level:' The Westernization of Nagas and Their Culture," Modern Asian Studies 46, no. 4 (July 2012): 893–918&lt;/ref&gt;

The following countries experienced a significant influence by the process of Westernization:
*'''{{flag|Turkey}}'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rise of Turkey: The Twenty-First Century's First Muslim Power|last=Cagaptay|first=Soner|publisher=[[Potomac Books]]|year=2014|isbn=9781612346519|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V8vQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although geographically only 3% of Turkey lies in Europe and the rest in the [[Middle East]], Turkey has a similar economic system, has a [[European Union-Turkey Customs Union|customs union]] with the European Union in addition to being an official candidate for membership, and is a member of typical Western organisations such as [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], [[Council of Europe]], and [[NATO]]. It is usually a member of European organisations for sports and cultural events such as [[UEFA]] and the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. 
*'''{{flag|Israel}}'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Fulbright difference |authorlink= |author=Richard T. Arndt, David Lee Rubin |series=Studies on cultural diplomacy and the Fulbright experience |year=1996 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |location= |isbn=9781560008613 |page=53 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LqMwKTUN7f0C&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=%22culturally+European%22+canada&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2010-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheldon Kirshner"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sheldon Kirshner |url=http://sheldonkirshner.com/?p=1673 |title=Is Israel Really a Western Nation? |publisher=Sheldon Kirshner Journal |date=2013-10-16 |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Israel is geographically located in the [[Middle East]], many Western cultural influences were brought in Israel by [[Aliyah|Jewish returnees]] from the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]], particularly countries like the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France and Germany. It is a member of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]. It is often a member of European organisations for sports and cultural events such as [[UEFA]] and the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], which is due in large part to Israel's ouster from their respective Asian counterparts. According to [[Sammy Smooha]], a professor emeritus of [[sociology]] at Haifa University, Israel is described as a "hybrid," a modern and developed "semi-Western" state. With the passage of time, he acknowledged, Israel will become "more and more Western." But as a result of the ongoing Arab-Israeli dispute, full Westernization will be a slow process in Israel.&lt;ref name="Sheldon Kirshner"/&gt;
*'''{{flag|Lebanon}}'''. Although Lebanon is geographically located in the [[Middle East]] north of Israel, Lebanon has almost 40% [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christians]] who are heavily influenced both culturally and socially by Western countries (particularly [[France]] with whom they share historical ties dating as early as the [[Crusader States|Crusader]]'s state of [[County of Tripoli]] founded by [[Raymond IV of Toulouse]] that encompassed most of present-day Lebanon. The French legacy within the whole Lebanese society is the widespread fluent knowledge of the [[French language]]). Western influence brought in by the country's Christians spread to the rest of its population, making today's Lebanon a unique blend of East and West. Lebanon's comparatively progressive society and the culture and features of metropolitan [[Beirut]], known as [[Paris of the East|Paris of the Middle East]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2002/jun/02/lebanon.observerescapesection|title=Paris of the east? More like Athens on speed|publisher=The Guardian | location=London|first=Rachel|last=Cooke|date=2006-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a testament to its westernization. In 2005, Lebanon [[Lebanon in the Eurovision Song Contest|intended to participate]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] but decided to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[BBC News Online]]''|date=2005-03-18|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4362373.stm|title=Lebanon withdraws from Eurovision|accessdate=2006-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''{{flag|Japan}}''' and '''{{flag|South Korea}}'''. Although [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]] are geographically located in [[East Asia]], they have democratic form of government, free market economic system, high standard of living and major contributions to Western science and technology, and could be described as "hybrid," modern and developed "semi-Western" states since a number of United States army bases are stationed in the two countries.
*'''{{flag|Hong Kong}}''', '''{{flag|Macau}}''', '''{{flag|Singapore}}''' and the '''{{flag|ROC|name=Republic of China (Taiwan)}}'''. Due to the heavy influences of European (particularly British; Portuguese in Macau) and American culture in places like Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore and Taiwan, these countries are considered westernized.
*'''{{flag|Philippines|name=The Philippines}}'''. Due to the heavy influences of European (particularly Spanish) and American cultures in the [[culture of the Philippines]], the country is considered westernized. Moreover, the Christian population makes up about 90% of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heydarian|first1=Richard|title=Philippines' Shallow Capitalism: Westernization Without Prosperity|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-javad-heydarian/philippines-shallow-capit_b_6441868.html|website=The Huffington Post|accessdate=19 November 2016|date=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''{{flag|South Africa|name=Republic of South Africa}}'''. Due to the heavy influence of European culture (particularly Dutch and British) in places like South Africa, it could be said that the country has achieved Westernization. Moreover, white South Africans make up about 9% of [[South Africa]]. Another 9% are of mixed race. Unlike black South Africans who have maintained their own native languages, most mixed South Africans speak Afrikaans as a first language. Likewise, most Indian South Africans speak English natively today. Therefore, it can be argued that this collective 20% of native English and Afrikaans speakers (both European-derived) live in heavily Western influenced cultures. Similarly, whites and coloureds are over 10% of the Namibian population. They primarily speak Afrikaans and German as a first language. In addition to that, many Black South Africans and Namibians speak European languages, e.g. Afrikaans and English, fluently and are also considered speakers of those languages.

Widening the definition of countries influenced by Westernization may cause controversies.

===Different views===
====Kishore Mahbubani and Westernization====
[[Kishore Mahbubani]]'s book entitled ''The Great Convergence: Asia, the West, and the Logic of One World'' (Public Affairs), is very optimistic{{Why|date=August 2014}}. It proposes that a new global civilization is being created. The majority of non-Western countries admire and adhere to Western living standards. However, he warns us that this newly emerging global order has to be ruled through new policies and attitudes. He argues that the policymakers all over the world must change their preconceptions and accept that we live in one world. The national interests must be balanced with global interests and the power must be shared. Mahbubani urges that only through these actions can we create a world that converges benignly.

He states there is conflict between "the West and the Rest." and offers three forms of general action that non-Western civilizations can react toward Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;Hungtington SP, "The Clash of Civilizations?" In: Lechner FJ, Boli J, editors. ''The Globalization Reader''. 4th ed. West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell; 2012. 37–44&lt;/ref&gt;
# Non-Western countries can attempt to achieve isolation in order to preserve their own values and protect themselves from Western invasion. However, Huntington argues that the costs of this action is high and only a few states can pursue it.
# According to the theory of "[[Bandwagoning|band-wagoning]]" non-Western countries can join and accept Western values.
# Non-Western countries can make an effort to balance Western power through modernization. They can develop economic, military power and cooperate with other non-Western countries against the West while still preserving their own values and institutions.

'''The End of Westernization'''
&lt;br /&gt;
Mahbubani counters this argument in his other book, ''The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East''. This time, he argues that Western influence is now "unraveling", with [[March to Modernity|Eastern powers]] such as China arising. He states:
{{quote|…the 5.6 billion people who live outside the West no longer believe in the innate or inherent superiority of Western civilization. Instead, many are beginning to question whether the West remains the most civilized part of the world. What we are witnessing today…is the progressive unwrapping of these many layers of Western influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mahbubani|first1=Kishore|title=The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East|date=April 28, 2009|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=978-1586486716|pages=129–30|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He goes on further to explain the decline of Western influence, stating reasons as to the loss of Western credibility with the rest of the world.
# There is an increasing perception that Western countries will prioritize their domestic problems over international issues, despite their spoken and written promises of having global interests and needs.
# The West has become increasingly biased and close-minded in their perception of "non-Western" countries such as China, declaring it an "un-free" country for not following a democratic form of government. 
# The West uses a double-standard when dealing with international issues. 
# As the biggest Eastern populations gain more power, they are moving away from the Western influences they sought after in the past. The "anti-Americanism" sentiment is not temporary, as Westerners would like to believe – the change in the Eastern mindset has become far too significant for it to change back.

====Samuel P. Huntington and Westernization====
In contrast to territorial delineation, others, like the American [[political scientist]] [[Samuel P. Huntington]] ''(see [[The Clash of Civilizations]])'', consider what is "Western" based on religious affiliation, such as deeming the majority-[[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] part of Europe and North America the West, and creating 6 other civilizations, including [[Latin America]], [[Confucian]], Japanese, [[Islamic]], [[Hindu]] and [[Slavic-Orthodox]], to organize the rest of the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graham|first=James|title=Samuel P. Huntington's Clash of Civilizations|url=http://www.historyorb.com/world/clashofcivilizations.php|publisher=History Orb|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Huntington claims that after the end of the [[Cold War|cold war]], world politics had been moved into a new aspect in which non- Western civilizations were no more the exploited recipients of Western civilization but become another important actor joining the West to shape and move the world history.&lt;ref&gt;Murden S. Cultures in world affairs. In: Baylis J, Smith S, Owens P, editors. The Globalization of World Politics. 5th ed. New York: Oxford University Press; 2011. pp. 416–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Huntington believed that while the age of [[ideology]] had ended, the world had only reverted to a normal state of affairs characterized by cultural conflict. In his thesis, he argued that the primary axis of conflict in the future will be along cultural and religious lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/mehbaliyev/rashad-mehbaliyev-civilizations-their-nature-and-clash-possibilities|title=Civilizations, their nature and clash possibilities (c) Rashad Mehbal…|last=mehbaliyev|date=30 October 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Edward Said and Westernization====
In ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' [[Edward Said]] views Westernization as it occurred in the process of [[colonization]], an exercise of essentializing a "subject race" in order to more effectively dominate them. Said references [[Arthur Balfour]], the British Prime Minister from 1902–1905, who regarded the rise of nationalism in Egypt in the late 19th century as counterproductive to a "benevolent" system of occupational rule. Balfour frames his argument in favor of continued rule over the Egyptian people by appealing to England's great "understanding" of Egypt's civilization and purporting that England's cultural strengths complimented and made them natural superiors to Egypt's racial deficiencies. Regarding this claim, Said says, "Knowledge to Balfour means surveying a civilization from its origins to its prime to its decline – and of course, it means being able to...The object of such knowledge is inherently vulnerable to scrutiny; this object is a ‘fact' which, if it develops, changes, or otherwise transforms itself...[the civilization] nevertheless is fundamentally, even ontologically stable. To have such knowledge of such a thing is to dominate it." The act of claiming coherent knowledge of a society in effect objectifies and others it into marginalization, making people who are classified into that race as "almost everywhere nearly the same." Said also argues that this relationship to the "inferior" races, in fact, works to also fortify and make coherent what is meant by "the West"; if "The Oriental is irrational, depraved (fallen), childlike, "different..." then "...the European is rational, virtuous, mature, normal." Thus, "the West" acts as a construction in the similar way as does "the Orient" – it is a created notion to justify a particular set of power relations, in this case the colonization and rule of a foreign country.

===Personal===
A different view on the Western world is not defining it by its territory, but by its people group, as these tend to differ in an increasingly globalised world. This view highlights the non-Western population in countries with a Western majority, or vice versa. The [[Boers]] for instance can be regarded as Western inhabitants of South Africa.

===Colonization (1400s–1970s)===
{{Main|Colonialism}}

====Europeanization====
From 1400s onward, [[Europeanization]] and [[colonialism]] spread gradually over much of the world and controlled different regions during this five centuries long period, [[History of colonialism|colonizing or subjecting]] the majority of the globe.
The two [[World War]]s weakened the European powers to such extent that many people in the colonies strove for independence, often inspired by nationalistic movements. A period of [[decolonization]] started. At the end of the 1960s, most colonies were autonomous. Those new states often adopted some aspects of Western [[politics]] such as a constitution, while frequently reacting against Western culture.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

====Westernization in Asia====

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TaiwaneseWeddingCouple.tiff|thumbnail|180px|A Taiwanese couple share in a loving embrace, wearing traditional Western wedding garments displayed by the white wedding gown and groom's tuxedo.]] --&gt;

General reactions to Westernization can include [[fundamentalism]], [[protectionism]] or embrace to varying degrees. Countries such as [[Korea]] and [[China]] attempted to adopt a system of [[isolationism]] but have ultimately juxtaposed parts of Western culture into their own, often adding original and unique social influences, as exemplified by the introduction of over 1,300 locations of the traditionally Western fast-food chain [[McDonald's]] into China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=McDonald's China Plans To Open A New Store Every Day In Four Years|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/29/mcdonalds-china-new-stores_n_913071.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=12 April 2013|first=Carey|last=Polis|date=2011-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific to [[Taiwan]], the industry of bridal photography (see [[Photography in Taiwan]]) has been significantly influenced by the Western idea of "love". As examined by author Bonnie Adrian, Taiwanese bridal photos of today provide a striking contrast to past accepted norms, contemporary couples often displaying great physical affection and, at times, placed in typically Western settings to augment the modernity, in comparison to the historically prominent relationship, often stoic and distant, exhibited between bride and groom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adrian|first=Bonnie|title=Framing the Bride: Globalizing Beauty and Romance in Taiwan's Bridal Industry|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Western concepts may have initially played a role in creating this cultural shift in Taiwan, the market and desire for bridal photography has not continued without adjustments and social modifications to this Western notion.

In [[Korea]], the first contact with Westernization was during the [[Chosun Dynasty]], in 17th century. Every year, the emperor would dispatch few envoy ambassadors to China and while they were staying in Beijing, the Western missionaries were there. Through the missionaries, Korean ambassadors were able to adopt the Western technology and culture. In 19th century, Korea started to send ambassadors to the foreign countries, other than Japan and [[China]]. While Korea was being Westernized slowly in late 19th century, Korea had the idea of "Eastern ways and Western frames (東道西器)", meaning that they would accept the Western "bowl", but use it with Eastern principles inside.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In Japan, the Netherlands continued to play a key role in transmitting Western know-how to the Japanese from the 17th century to the mid-19th century, as the Japanese had opened their doors only to Dutch merchants before US Navy [[Matthew C. Perry|Commodore Matthew Perry]]'s visit in 1852. After Commodore Perry's visit, Japan began to deliberately accept Western culture to the point of hiring Westerners to teach Western customs and traditions to the Japanese starting in the [[Meiji era]]. Many Japanese politicians have since also encouraged the Westernization of Japan using the term ''[[Datsu-A Ron]]'', which means the argument for "leaving Asia" or "Good-bye Asia". In ''Datsu-A Ron'', "Westernization" was described as an "unavoidable" but "fruitful" change. After Japan's [[Surrender of Japan|surrender]] to the United States and its allies ended [[World War II]], the Westernization process of Japanese culture was further intensified and today, Japan is notably among the most Westernized countries in [[Asia]].{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} However, in contrast, despite many advances in industrial efficiency, Japan has managed to sustain a culture of strict social hierarchy and limited individualization.&lt;ref&gt;Dore 1984, Unity and Diversity in World Culture in Bull &amp; Watson eds. Expansion of International society, OUP, p 416&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Iran]], the process of Westernization dates back to the country's attempt to westernize during the beginning in the 1930s, which was dictated by [[Rezā Shāh|Shah Rezā Khan]] and continued by [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|his son]] during the Cold War and agitated the largely conservative [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslim]] masses of the country, was partly responsible for the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In [[Turkey]], the process of Westernization dates back to the 19th century, known as the [[Tanzimat]] ''(reorganization)'' period. The [[Ottoman Empire]] began to change itself according to western science, practice and culture. The Empire took some innovations from the West. Also, by the contribution of foreign engineers the Empire repaired its old arm systems. Newly-found schools, permanent ambassadors, and privy councils were essential improvement for the Empire. All these reformations had good impact at the point of collapse. Also, the innovation brought from European countries shaped the Empire as a nation run along modern lines.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The Westernization efforts continued under the leadership of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], with the adaptation of the [[Latin-script alphabet]] and the [[Laïcité|French concept of secularism]]. As a result, Turkey is one of the most Westernized majority-Muslim nations.

===Globalization (1970s–present)===
Westernization is often regarded as a part of the ongoing process of [[globalization]]. This theory proposes that Western thought has led to globalisation, and that globalisation propagates Western culture, leading to a cycle of Westernization. On top of largely Western government systems such as [[democracy]] and [[constitution]], many Western technologies and customs like music, clothing and cars have been introduced across various parts of the world and copied and created in traditionally non-Western countries.

However, Westernization has been also reversed in some countries following wars or changes in regime, for example: [[China]] excluding [[Taiwan]] after 1949, South Vietnam after Communist takeover in 1975, Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion and Iran after the 1979 revolution.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The main characteristics are economic and political ([[free trade]]) democratisation, combined with the spread of an [[Individualism|individualised culture]]. Often it was regarded as opposite to the worldwide influence of [[Communism]]. After the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|break-up]] of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in late 1991 and the end of the [[Cold War]], many of its component states and allies nevertheless underwent Westernization, including [[privatization]] of hitherto state-controlled industry.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

With debates still going on, the question of whether globalization can be characterized as Westernization can be seen in various aspects. Globalization is happening in various aspects, ranging from economics, politics and even to food or culture. Westernization, to some schools, is seen as a form of globalization that leads the world to be similar with Western powers. Being globalized means taking positive aspects of the world, but globalization also brings about the debate about being Westernized. Democracy, fast foods, and American pop-culture can all be examples that are considered as Westernization of the world.

According to the "Theory of the Globe scrambled by Social network: a new Sphere of Influence 2.0", published by [[Jura Gentium]] (the [[University of Florence]]), an increasing role in Westernisation is ruled by [[Social Media]]. The comparison with Eastern realities, who decided to ban the American Social Medias (as Iran and China with Facebook, Twitter), marks a political desire to avoid the process of Westernisation of own population and way to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;Peccia, T., 2014, "[http://www.juragentium.org/topics/wlgo/en/peccia.htm The Theory of the Globe Scrambled by Social Networks: A New Sphere of Influence 2.0]", Jura Gentium – Rivista di Filosofia del Diritto Internazionale e della Politica Globale, Sezione "L'Afghanistan Contemporaneo".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Due to the colonization of the [[Americas]] and [[Oceania]] by [[Europe]]ans, the cultural, ethnic and linguistic make-up of the Americas and Oceania has been changed. This is most visible in former settler colonies such as the United States of America, [[Argentina]], Australia, [[Canada]], [[Chile]] and New Zealand, where the traditional [[indigenous peoples|indigenous population]] has been predominantly replaced demographically by non-indigenous settlers due to transmitted disease and conflict. This demographic takeover in settler countries has often resulted in the linguistic, social, and cultural marginalisation of indigenous people. However, even in countries where large populations of indigenous people remain or the indigenous peoples have mixed ([[mestizo]]) considerably with European settlers, such as [[Bolivia]], [[Guatemala]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]] and [[Ecuador]], relative marginalisation still exists.

Due to colonization and European immigration, the prevalent native languages in the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, [[Northern Asia]] and part of [[South Africa]] and [[Central Asia]], are now usually European languages or creoles based on them:
*[[North American English|English]] (United States and Canada without French-speaking Quebec)
*[[English language|English]] – Australia and New Zealand or [[English language|English]] along with [[English-based creole languages]] ([[Jamaica]] and most of the [[West Indies]], [[Guyana]]).
*[[French language|French]] ([[Quebec]], [[New Brunswick]] and parts of [[Ontario]] in Canada and [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]); [[French language|French]] along with [[French-based creole languages]] ([[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Haiti]], [[Martinique]] and [[Saint-Barthelemy]]).
*[[Spanish language|Spanish]] ([[Hispanic America]], although in [[Paraguay]] most people are bilingual with [[Guarani language|Guarani]] and there are more Guarani speakers than Spanish speakers).
*[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ([[Brazil]]).
*[[Russian language|Russian]] – ([[Northern Asia]] and parts of [[Central Asia]]).
*[[Dutch language|Dutch]] along with [[Creole languages]] ([[Suriname]], [[Aruba]] and the [[Netherlands Antilles]]).
*[[Afrikaans]] along with English (parts of South Africa and [[Namibia]]).
*[[German language|German]] along with [[Creole languages]] (along with [[Afrikaans]] in [[Namibia]] and some areas in the US, such as [[Pennsylvania]] ([[Pennsylvania Dutch]]))

Many indigenous languages are on the verge of becoming extinct. However, some settler countries have gone to lengths to preserve indigenous languages; for example, in New Zealand the [[Māori language]] is one of three official languages, the others being English and New Zealand sign language.
