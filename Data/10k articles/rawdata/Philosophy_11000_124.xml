'''''A Lawyer Walks Into a Bar...''''' is a 2007 [[independent film]] about [[lawyers]], [[law school]], [[State Bar of California|the California Bar]] exam, and the obsession America has with its legal system. The film has garnered many positive reviews including coverage from ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', [[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere.com]] and on nationally syndicated television show ''[[At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper]]''.&lt;ref name="blogs.wsj.com"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2007/02/23/bar-exam-the-movie | title=Wall Street Journal:  Bar Exam, The Movie! | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Nathan | last=Koppel | date=February 23, 2007}} February 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/fea/columnists/apeppard/stories/DN-OTTpeppard_0105gl.ART.State.Edition1.3df85f1.html| title=Filmmakers Put to the Test}} Dallas Morning News, January 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.premiere.com/blog/2007/03/sxsw_sum_up_day_4.html |title=SXSW Roundup Day 8 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606022324/http://news.premiere.com/blog/2007/03/sxsw_sum_up_day_4.html |archivedate=2010-06-06 }} March 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/ |title=At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper, Now on DVD |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002104512/http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/ |archivedate=2007-10-02 }} ''At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper'', September 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film content ==

This film highlights the trials and tribulations of trying to pass the [[State Bar of California]] exam and follows six wanna-be lawyers struggling to prepare and actually pass the test with the lowest national pass rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.counseltocounsel.com/2007/03/lawyer-walks-into-bar.html| title= A Lawyer Walks Into A Bar! }} Counsel to Counsel, March 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; One of the test takers in the documentary is Donald Baumeister, an ex-Marine, who had failed the California bar 41 times and is shown in the movie gearing up for attempt #42. A working father, Baumeister never had the time to properly study for the exam.&lt;ref name="blogs.wsj.com"/&gt;

This movie portrays a common perception of American life – that, in the time of trouble, whether it be civil or criminal, Americans depend on lawyers to navigate the tough waters of today’s judicial system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0XR3EjxaO4| title=On Lawyers}} YouTube, June 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Festival accolades===

''A Lawyer Walks Into a Bar...'' has won awards at many independent film festivals including the Grand Jury Prize at AFI Dallas's Texas Competition, and Boulder Colorado's Toofy Fest's Best Narrative Feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afidallas.com/Awards.php |title=AFI Dallas Awards 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014190110/http://afidallas.com/Awards.php |archivedate=2007-10-14 }} AFI Dallas April 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toofy.com/2007_schedule.html#Lawyer_Walks | title=Toofy Fest Awards 2007}} Toofy Fest Boulder CO September 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===A focus on minorities===

''A Lawyer Walks Into a Bar...'' is a movie that not only portrays the fight of the average law school student, but also of the minority and not so fortunate law student trying to pass and be admitted to a major state bar.  The movie follows Magda Madrigal as she attends [[Peoples College of Law]] so that she can take the bar and be an advocate for people in her local Hispanic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/so_this_lawyer_walks_into_a_bar/| title= So, This Lawyer Walks Into A Bar}} ABA Journal, June 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cast of characters===
Meagan Meadows and Cassandra Hooks are shown passing the July 2006 Bar examination in the movie.&lt;ref name="members.calbar.ca.gov"&gt;http://members.calbar.ca.gov/search/member_detail.aspx?x=245033&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://members.calbar.ca.gov/search/member_detail.aspx?x=244471&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for the rest of those followed for the July 2006 Bar Exam, Donald Baumeister failed the bar for the 42nd time and Sam Garrett failed it for the third time. Magda Madrigal did not take the July 2006 exam because the State Bar determined that she had not taken enough units at Peoples College of Law, an unaccredited law school.

The movie does follow-up with the subsequent exam and shares that Tricia Zunker successfully passed the February 2007 California Bar,&lt;ref&gt;http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Member/Detail/249575&lt;/ref&gt; but neither Donald Baumeister, Sam Garrett nor Madga Madrigal passed at that time.

While not shown in the movie, the California Bar shows that Ms. Madrigal did pass the July 2009 Bar Exam.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Member/Detail/264637&lt;/ref&gt; Sam Garrett passed the New Jersey Bar Exam in May 2009 and the California Bar Exam in February 2011. He was admitted to the California Bar on October 27, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Member/Detail/277789&lt;/ref&gt;

===Where are they now?===
Mr. Baumeister is an Educational Consultant at Integrative Medical Institute of Orange County as well as an instructor at California State University, Los Angeles and Chapman University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linkedin.com/in/integrativemedicalbaumeister&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Garrett was vice-president of Bienvenidos Immigration Services in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bienvenidosimmigration.org/Contact_P78K.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812104829/http://bienvenidosimmigration.org/Contact_P78K.html |archivedate=2011-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/samugarrett&lt;/ref&gt; He is now in solo practice in New York.&lt;ref&gt;http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Member/Detail/277789&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2907">'''ʿAbd-Al-Razzāq B. ʿAlī B. Al-Hosayn Lāhījī''' (died c. 1072 [[Islamic_calendar|AH]] [1662 CE]) was an Iranian theologian, poet and philosopher.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abd-al-razzaq-lahiji-11th-17th-century-theologian-and-philosopher W. Madelung, "ʿABD-AL-RAZZĀQ LĀHĪJĪ" in ''Encyclopaedia Iranica'']&lt;/ref&gt;  His mentor in philosophy was his father-in-law [[Mulla Sadra]].

==Life==
Hailing from [[Lahijan]] in [[Gilan]], he spent most of his life in [[Qom]].  Abd al--Razzaq was a son-in-law of [[Mulla Sadra]] along with Molla Mohsen Feyz Kashani.&lt;ref&gt;SAJJAD H. RIZVI in Josef Meri,p.531.2006&lt;/ref&gt;  His son [[Hasan Lahiji|Hasan]] would become another prominent theologian and philosopher of the Safavid dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Ostadi Reza, Hasan Lahiji and his cradle of certainty, p.88, Mirath Javid Magazine (in Persian)&lt;/ref&gt; Seyyed [[Hossein Nasr]] knows him among the intellectual figures in Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr in Expectation of the Millennium : Shiìsm in History,p.165.1989&lt;/ref&gt;  Abd al--Razzaq was in agreement with Molla Sadra as to the contrast between primacy of [[quiddity]] and primacy of existence.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Zailan, Revelation, Intellectual Intuition and Reason in the Philosophy of Mulla Sadra: An Analysis of the Al-hikmah Al-'arshiyyah, p.196.1392 Ap.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
*''Gawhar-e morād'' (Tehran, 1271 AH), a detailed exposition of his theology
*''Sarmāya-ye īmān''
*''Dīvān'', a volume of his poetry
*''Tašrīqāt'', three treatises on divine unity, justice and love

==Teaching and pupils==
According to Madlung, Abd-Razzaq taught at the Masumieh madrasah.  There his prominent pupils included his sons Hasan and Ebrahim as well as Qazi Saeed Qommi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abd-al-razzaq-lahiji-11th-17th-century-theologian-and-philosopher|title=ʿABD-AL-RAZZĀQ LĀHĪJĪ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Lāhīǰī stands at the end of a transition in Islamic scholastic theology in which the thought system of ''[[Ilm_al-Kalam|kalam]]'' was gradually replaced by that of ''[[Islamic_philosophy#Falsafa|falsafa]]'', heavily influenced by the school of [[Avicenna]].&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; Lahiji in fact developed a form of Kalam which is hardly distinguishable from Hikmat, although at least in his better known works such as the "Gawhar-e morād" he does not follow the main doctrinal teachings of Mulla Sadra, as on the unity of Being and the catharsis of the faculty of imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 6 - The Timurid and Safavid Periods, p.691&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adolf''' (also spelt '''Adolph''' or '''Adolphe''', '''Adolfo''' and when [[Latinisation (literature)|Latinised]] '''Adolphus''') is a [[given name]] used in [[German language|German]]-speaking countries, [[Scandinavia]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Flanders]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and to a lesser extent in various [[Central Europe]]an countries.  Adolphus can also appear as a surname, as in [[John Adolphus]], the English historian. The name is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] derived from the [[Old High German]] ''Athalwolf'', a composition of ''athal'', or ''adal'', meaning "noble", and  ''[[wolf]]''. The name is [[cognate]] to the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] name ''[[Æthelwulf]]'' (also Eadulf or Eadwulf).

==Popularity and usage==
During the 19th and early 20th century, ''Adolf'' was a common name for babies in German-speaking countries and to a lesser extent also in French-speaking countries (spelled there as ''Adolphe''). However, because of negative associations with the dictator of [[Nazi Germany]] [[Adolf Hitler]], it has declined in popularity as a given name for males since the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="name incidence Adolf"&gt;{{cite web |title= Name Adolf statistics and meaning / Vorname Adolf * Statistik und Bedeutung |accessdate= 4 June 2012 |url= http://www.beliebte-vornamen.de/4501-adolf.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains common among people born before the war. [[Adolf Dassler]], the founder of [[Adidas]], used his nickname, 'Adi', in his professional life and for the name of his company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adidas-group.com/en/group/history/|title=History|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208215436/http://www.adidas-group.com/en/group/history/|archivedate=2015-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[French language|French]] version, ''Adolphe''—previously a fairly common name in [[France]] and  the name of [[Adolphe|a classic French novel]]—has virtually disappeared, along with [[Italian language|Italian]] ''Adolfo''.

However, the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] version, ''Adolfo'', has not become stigmatised in the same way. It is still in common use in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohbabynames.com/meaning/name/adolfo/2060#.WTcBZOvyvcs|title=Adolfo - Baby Boy Name Meaning and Origin {{!}} Oh Baby!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3838">'''''An Agenda for Peace: Preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping''''', more commonly known simply as '''''An Agenda for Peace''''', is a report written for the [[United Nations]] by Secretary-General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] in 1992.  In it, Boutros-Ghali responds to a request by the UN [[Security Council]] for an "analysis and recommendations" to strengthen peacemaking and peace-keeping.  The document outlines the way Boutros-Ghali felt the UN should respond to conflict in the post-[[Cold War]] world.

Recognizing the limitations of [[peacekeeping]], especially as such efforts were becoming prevalent in the early 1990s, the UN Security Council convened in 1992 in a first-time meeting of heads of state.  The 15 members finished the conference by issuing a statement calling on then-Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to write a report recommending future reforms.  In their statement, the heads-of-state recognized that, &lt;blockquote&gt;“The absence of war and military conflicts amongst States does not in itself ensure international peace and security.  The non-military sources of instability in the economic, social, [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] and [[ecological]] fields have become threats to peace and security.  The United Nations membership as a whole, working through the appropriate bodies, needs to give the highest priority to the solution of these matters.”&lt;ref name=intro&gt;UN Department of Public Information, Yearbook of the United Nations 1992, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Security Council saw what many critics of peacekeeping have suggested, and some recent failures had made obvious: peacekeeping alone, as then practiced, was not enough to ensure lasting peace.
	
Boutros-Ghali submitted his response some months later, in the form of ''An Agenda for Peace''.  In it, he outlined a number of additional processes of preventative diplomacy the international community could use before peacekeeping, or simultaneously.  He also suggested distinct definitions for peacemaking and peacekeeping, and referenced [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]] to justify military involvement without the consent of both parties.&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Doyle, "Discovering the Limits and Potential of Peacekeeping," 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously, these concepts had not been formally addressed by the UN's leadership.  However, ''An Agenda for Peace''’s most significant contribution to the modern understanding of peace is its introduction of the concept of “post-conflict [[peacebuilding]].”  Boutros-Ghali defines “post-conflict peace-building” as “action to identify and support structures which will tend to strengthen and solidify peace in order to avoid a relapse into conflict.”&lt;ref&gt;Boutros Boutros-Ghali, "An Agenda for Peace,” II.21.
&lt;/ref&gt;  
	
The concept of post-conflict peacebuilding has been especially important in the academic discipline of [[peace and conflict studies]].  It has been adopted by a number of scholars to suggest a framework for peace that addresses not only the latent forms of physical violence, but also aspects of a society that are structurally violent, and could lead to a re-emergence of fighting (see the discussion of [[Peace and conflict studies#Conceptions of peace|positive peace]] in the article on [[peace and conflict studies]]).

'''Anna Tumarkin''' ({{lang-be|А́нна-Э́стер Паўлаўна Тума́ркін}}, {{lang-he|אנה-אסתר פבלובנה טומרקין}}, 16 February 1875 – 7 August 1951) was a Russian-born, naturalized Swiss academic, who was the first woman to become a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Bern]]. She was the first woman in Europe to be allowed to examine doctoral and professorial candidates and the first woman to sit as a member of a University Senate anywhere in Europe.

==Early life==
Anna-Ester Pavlovna Tumarkin was born on 16 February 1875 in [[Dubrowna]], in the [[Mogilev Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] to Sofia (née Gertsenshtein or Herzenstein) and Poltiel Moiseevich Tumarkin (also shown as Pavel). Her father was a [[Bessarabia]]n merchant who had been granted personal nobility.{{sfn|Zabolotnaia|2002|pp=193–196}}{{sfn|Бургер|2010}}{{sfn|Ludi|2012}} As an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jew]], Pavel initially refused to allow his children to study [[Russian language|Russian]], but the children gained proficiency in both Russian and German. When she was a young child, the family relocated to [[Kishinev]] (''Chișinău''), capital of the [[Bessarabia Governorate]]. She attended the [[Gymnasium (school)|women's gymnasium]] and then attended [[normal school]].{{sfn|Бургер|2010}}{{sfn|Мялешка|2016|p=18}}

Wanting to attend university, but finding higher education forbidden in Russia,{{sfn|Epp|2014}} in 1892, Tumarkin moved to Switzerland to study at the [[University of Bern]] under Ludwig Stein.{{sfn|Ludi|2012}}{{sfn|Мялешка|2016|p=18}} Three years later, she submitted her thesis on  [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and [[Immanuel Kant]],{{sfn|Epp|2014}} which she successfully defended, and passed her examinations earning her doctorate.{{sfn|Бургер|2010}} Around this same time, she met Anna Hoff, an older woman and friend of Dr. Stein's, who often attended the lectures he held at his home. The two became friends, making a habit of sitting together at lectures, and Hoff introduced Tumarkin to her daughter, [[Ida Hoff|Ida]], who was five years younger than Tumarkin.{{sfn|Rogger|2002|p=111}} Tumarkin and the younger Hoff, would later become life-long companions, though there is no evidence one way or the other to determine if their relationship was a [[lesbian]] partnership.{{sfn|Rogger|2002|p=112}} She then moved to [[Berlin]] where she continued her studies for three years with [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[Erich Schmidt (historian)|Erich Schmidt]], before returning to Bern to complete her thesis and examination for her [[Habilitation]] in 1898, becoming not only the first woman in Switzerland to complete her post-doctoral work, but the first woman in Europe.{{sfn|Ludi|2012}}{{sfn|Epp|2014}}{{sfn|Hirsch|2013|p=193}}

==Career==
Because there was no precedent for a woman to be appointed to the faculty of history or philosophy, a letter was sent to [[Albert Gobat]], the Director of Education for Bern to ask if there was an objection to appointing a woman as an assistant professor. As he had no reservations, Tumarkin received the title ''Venia Docendi'' becoming a [[docent]].{{sfn|Бургер|2010}}{{sfn|Epp|2014}}{{sfn|Мялешка|2016|p=19}} By 1905, she became the first woman [[lecturer]] at the University of Bern and in 1906 became an honorary professor, another first for the University of Bern.{{sfn|Ludi|2012}}{{sfn|Epp|2014}}{{sfn|Scandola|Rogger|2002|p=5}} Her lectures spanned from classic philosophers like [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] to more modern philosophers such as [[Martin Heidegger]] and she had a special affinity for [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], Kant, and [[Baruch Spinoza]].{{sfn|Rogger|1999}} When Stein left in 1909, she took over his post, and was promoted to [[extraordinary professor]].{{sfn|Бургер|2010}}{{sfn|Epp|2014}} She was the only woman to apply for the post, among 30 candidates. Though she had adequate qualifications, the administration was unwilling to grant her the chair of the department, which instead went to {{ill|Richard Herbertz|de}}.{{sfn|Rogger|1999}} Though she performed the same duties Stein had, including lecturing, preparing professorial examinations and supervising doctoral students, Tumarkin was never granted an ordinary professorship with a department chair; however, the appointment was the first such position granted to a woman in Europe.{{sfn|Бургер|2010}}{{sfn|Epp|2014}} {{#tag:ref|[[Sofia Kovalevskaya]] was granted the first extraordinary professorship for a woman in Europe in 1884; however, she was not authorized to examine candidates for doctorates or professorships.{{sfn|Scandola|Rogger|2002|p=5}}|group="Notes"}} On 13 May 1910, she took her seat in the University Senate, as the first female in Switzerland or Europe to be part of the highest academic body at the university.{{sfn|Бургер|2010}}{{sfn|Scandola|Rogger|2002|p=5}}

In 1912, Tumarkin became the roommate of Ida Hoff, who by that time had graduated from her studies and become one of the first female physicians in Bern. Hoff had opened her own practice in 1911 and recently moved to a larger house on [[Amthausgasse]] (Office-building street) to facilitate her growing practice.{{sfn|Rogger|2002|pp=107, 109–111}} With room to spare, she asked Tumarkin to join her to share the accommodations.{{sfn|Rogger|2002|p=111}} The two women were opposites in personality with Hoff being firmly grounded, practical, and a free-spirit, while Tumarkin was an abstract thinker, preferred routine, and was often engaged in seeking rational explanations for minutia.{{sfn|Rogger|2002|p=112}} In 1918, Tumarkin's Russian passport was nullified when Chișinău became part of the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and she sought Swiss citizenship, which was granted to her in 1921.{{sfn|Бургер|2010}} That same year, in the spring, they moved together into a new home on Hallwylstrasse, a few doors down from the [[Swiss National Library]], filling the house with beautiful furniture and setting aside a room as their own library.{{sfn|Rogger|2002|p=111}} 

Hoff was one of he first women in Bern to own a car and the two women enjoyed taking Sunday drives to visit the various [[cantons of Switzerland]]. They also ventured further abroad,{{sfn|Rogger|2002|p=113}} like a trip in 1925, when for the first time, Tumarkin took Hoff to visit her family in Chișinău.{{sfn|Rogger|2002|p=112}} They also took a trip to Greece together in 1927.{{sfn|Rogger|2002|p=113}} In the 1920s, Hoff, who was a feminist convinced Tumarkin of the advantages of [[women's suffrage]] and thereafter, Tumarkin became committed to women gaining the vote. In 1928 she participated in the first Swiss Exhibition for Women's Work ({{lang-de|Schweizeische Ausstellung für Frauenarbeit ([[SAFFA]])}}), representing the scientific participants.{{sfn|Epp|2014}} That same year, she published two papers, ''Ein Blick in das Geistesleben der Schweizer Frauen'' (''A Historical Look at the Spiritual Life of Swiss Women'') and ''Das Stimmrecht der Frauen'' (''The Voting Rights of Women''), evaluating women's place in Swiss society.{{sfn|Бургер|2010}}

Events in her homeland during the [[Russian Revolution]], [[Russian Civil War]], and the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] in Germany, were deeply troubling to Tumarkin, whose family had been targeted with surveillance, and threatened with deportation. In 1937, she and Hoff made another trip to visit her family and were struck by the harsh contrast between the two visits.{{sfn|Бургер|2010}}{{sfn|Rogger|2002|p=113}} That same year, she was awarded the Theodor Kocher Prize from the University.{{sfn|Ludi|2012}} Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Tumarkin published many works which evaluated Russian culture in its historical context as well as how that had shaped Swiss society. Some of her most noted works in this context are ''Der Aesthetiker Johann Georg Sulzer'' (''The Aesthetist Johann Georg Sulzer'', 1933), ''Das Problem der Freiheit in der schweizerischen Philosophie'' (''The Problem of Freedom in Swiss Philosophy'', 1940), and ''Der Anteil der Schweiz an der Entwicklung der Philosophie'' (''The Contributions of Switzerland in the Development of Philosophy'', 1942).{{sfn|Бургер|2010}} Her 1948 publication, ''Wesen und Werden der schweizerischen Philosophie'' (''Being and Becoming Swiss Philosophy'') evaluated the intellectual history of [[Huldrych Zwingli]] to [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] and concluded that the Swiss had developed an autonomous philosophy.{{sfn|Epp|2014}}

The events of [[The Holocaust]], in which she lost many family members and friends, began to affect her health. By 1943, she was forced to retire for medical problems, when she developed [[elephantiasis]].{{sfn|Бургер|2010}}{{sfn|Epp|2014}} Hoff tried to care for her companion at home, but Tumarkin's decline continued and she became increasingly confused.{{sfn|Rogger|2002|p=115}}

==Death and legacy==
Six weeks after Hoff brought Tumarkin to the Siloah Deaconess House in [[Gümligen]], Tumarkin died on 7 August 1951. Hoff's will to live was shaken by the loss of her life-long partner and she died almost exactly one year later on 4 August 1952.{{sfn|Rogger|2002|p=115}} Tumarkin's work on her former advisor, ''Wilhelm Dilthey'' (1912), influenced the way future scholars evaluated his work, defining three phases in his development, which show how he evaluated the same problems at different times from new angles, arriving at seemingly contradictory solutions. Tumarkin described his process as "an organic development with its concentric circles: ever in a more profound and original manner".{{sfn|Bambach|1995|pp=130–131}}

In February 2000, next to the original building housing the University of Berne, a street, Tumarkinweg, was named in her honor.{{sfn|Бургер|2010}} In 2014, a book honoring women pioneers ''Pionnières de la Suisse moderne: Des femmes qui ont vécu la liberté'' (''Pioneers of Modern Switzerland: Women Who Lived for Freedom'') was published by Editions Slatkine and included a profile on Tumarkin.{{sfn|Epp|2014}}{{sfn|Adler|Epp|Wirz|2014}}

==Biography==

===Youth and early career===
Jinarakkhita was born in [[Bogor]], West Java on 23 January 1923&lt;ref group=web name="LankaWeb" /&gt; as Tee Boan-an 戴满安,{{sfn|Melton|2010|p=1449}} the third son of The Hong Gie and Tan Sep Moy.&lt;ref group=web name="devotees" /&gt; 
According to Juangari, as a young boy Tee Boan-an was already interested in yoga and "mystic powers".&lt;ref group=web name="devotees" /&gt; As a boy, he met a Theosophist from the Netherlands, who encouraged him to read "The Ancient Wisdom" and "The Secret Doctrines".&lt;ref group=web name="devotees" /&gt; When he was a teenager, Tee Boan-an practiced meditation at Gede Mountain and Salak Mountain, and visited "virtuous people" and Viharas to gain spiritual knowledge.&lt;ref group=web name="devotees" /&gt;

After attending the HBS at Jakarta and the Technical School in Bandung, he left in 1946 for the Netherlands to study chemistry at [[Groningen University]].&lt;ref group=web name="LankaWeb" /&gt; There he also continued his interest in Theosophy.&lt;ref group=web name="devotees" /&gt; He also learnt Pali and Sanskrit languages from Dr. Van Der Leeuw,&lt;ref group=web name="devotees" /&gt; and acquired fluency in English, German, French, and Dutch.&lt;ref group=web name="devotees" /&gt; During holidays, he went to France, where he had the opportunity to attend lectures by [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]].&lt;ref group=web name="devotees" /&gt;

In 1951&lt;ref group=web name="devotees" /&gt; he returned to Indonesia, where he worked as a teacher at several secondary schools in Jakarta,&lt;ref group=web name="LankaWeb" /&gt; but also took an active interest in religion.

===Buddhist ordination===
{{See also|Theosophical Society|Buddhist modernism|Vipassana movement}}

Tee Boan-an became president of the Indonesian Sam Kauw Union&lt;ref group=web name="LankaWeb" /&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="devotees" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|See &lt;ref group=web name="Ditthi"&gt;[http://www.buddhismandaustralia.com/index.php/en/articles/articles-2012/102-buddhism-in-indonesia-past-and-present-ven-ditthisampanno.html Ven.

Tee Boan-an received ordination as a Mahayana [[Ch'an]]&lt;ref group=web name="Ditthi" /&gt; novice monk on 29 July 1953, and received the name Tizheng 體正 (Te Cheng) from the Chinese Mahayana priest Benqing (Pen Ching/Pen Cheng) Lao Heshang,&lt;ref group=web name="LankaWeb" /&gt;{{sfn|Melton|2010|p=1449}} from the [[Guanghua Temple (Putian)|Guanghua Monastery]] in [[Putian]], China.&lt;ref group=web name="Braak2015"&gt;[http://www.vriendenvanboeddhisme.nl/2015/china.html Andre van der Braak, ''Vijf bezoeken aan China verder], Vrienden van het Boeddhisme, januari 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|本清老和尚,&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://remajabuddhist.wordpress.com/buddhayana/ Buddhayana]&lt;/ref&gt; also known as Y.A. Mahasthavira Arya Mula.,&lt;ref group=web name="devotees" /&gt; Pen Ching Lau He Sang (pinyin: Benqing Lao Heshang),{{sfn|Melton|2010|p=1449}} Pun-Cheng,{{sfn|Maha Karuna Ch'an|(year unknown)|p=42}} and Pen Cheng.{{sfn|Verboven|1992}} Pen Cheng (1878&lt;ref group=web name="devotees" /&gt; or 1887{{sfn|Verboven|1992}}-1962) was born at Wu Chen Li village, at Putian district, Fujian, China.&lt;ref group=web name="devotees" /&gt; He was trained in Kuang Hua Ssu 廣化寺 (Kuang Hua, [[Guanghua Temple (Putian)|Guanghua Temple]], "Vast Influence",{{sfn|Hsüan Hua|2003|p=189}} in Fo Tiën{{sfn|Verboven|1992}} ([[Fujian]]), a monastery which was influenced by [[Hsu Yun]], abbot of Ku Shan Ssu (Gu Shan) monastery in Fo Tiën (see also Charles Luk (Lu K'uan Yü), "Chan and Zen Teaching"{{sfn|Verboven|1992}}). Benqing came to Indonesia in the beginning of the 20th century. {{sfn|Verboven|1992}} This was in the time of the socalled Buddhist Revival, when, under influence of the western culture, attempt were being made to revitalize Chinese Buddhism.{{sfn|Huai-Chin|1999}} Most notable were the [[Humanistic Buddhism]] of [[Taixu]], and the revival of [[Chinese Chán]] by [[Hsu Yun]].{{sfn|Huai-Chin|1999}}}} Eventually, Tizheng received dharma transmission from Benqing.{{sfn|Verboven|1992}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://eng.longquanzs.org/scholars/60599.htm Voice of Longquan, ''Ton Lathouwers'']&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Communists took over power in China in 1949, Buddhist monasteries were closed in China, and Indonesia tried to diminish Chinese influences in Indonesia.{{sfn|Verboven|1992}} For these reasons, further Ch'an-training in China was problematic,{{sfn|Verboven|1992}} 
and Benqing sent Tizheng to Burma in 1953, where he practiced [[satipatthana]] meditation under [[Mahasi Sayadaw]].&lt;ref group=web name="Ditthi" /&gt;{{sfn|Verboven|1992}} Tizheng was ordained as a Theravada monk in 1954, and received the name Ashin Jinarakkhita.{{sfn|Melton|2010|p=1449}} The same year he returned to Indonesia,

===Buddhist Revival===
Jinarakkhita was instrumental in the revival of Buddhism in Indonesia. He realised that Buddhism had to adapt to Indonesian culture to survive; otherwise it would remain a foreign "fremdkörper".{{sfn|Verboven|1992}}{{refn|group=note|The same strategy was being followed by Catholic missionaries like the [[Divine Word Missionaries]] (SVD) and the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], who were aware of the value of the Javanese culture and identity.{{sfn|Ricklefs|2007|p=122-124}}}}

In 1955 Jinarakkhita formed the first Indonesian Buddhist lay organisation, Persaudaraan Upasaka Upasika Indonesia (PUUI).{{sfn|Melton|2010|p=1449}} In 1957, the PUUI was integrated into the Indonesian Buddhist Association (Perhimpunan Buddhis Indonesia, Perbudi),{{sfn|Melton|2010|p=1449}} in which both Theravada and Mahayana priesthood were united.{{sfn|Melton|2010|p=1449}} Nowadays, the PUUI is called Majelis Buddhayana Indonesia (MBI).&lt;ref group=web name="Buddhayana"&gt;[http://gabveg.wordpress.com/budhhayana/ Buddhayana]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 Jinarakkhita established the Sangha Suci Indonesia, as a monastic organisation. In 1963 the name was changed to Maha Sangha of Indonesia, and in 1974 the name was change into Sangha Agung Indonesia. It is a community of monastics from the Theravada, Mahayana and Tantrayana traditions.&lt;ref group=web name="Buddhayana" /&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="Ditthi" /&gt;{{sfn|Suryadinata|1995|p=49}}

In 1965, after a [[Transition to the New Order|coup-attempt]], Buddhist organisations had to comply with the first principle of the Indonesian state ideology, ''Pancasila'', the belief in one supreme God.{{sfn|Suryadinata|1995|p=48}} All organisations that doubted or denied the existence of God were outlawed.{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=297}} this posed a problem for Indonesian Buddhism, which was solved by Jinarakkhita by presenting [[nibbana]] as the Theravada "God", and Adi-Buddha, the primaeval Buddha of the region's previous Mantrayana Buddhism, as the Mahayana "God".{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=297}} According to Jinarakkhita, the concept of ''Adi Buddha'' was found in the tenth-century Javanese Buddhist text ''Sang Hyang Kamhayanikan''.{{sfn|Suryadinata|1995|p=48}}

Another important factor in the Buddhist Revival was the use of a new category of lay Buddhist teachers.{{sfn|Lathouwers|2008}} Those were older Buddhists without a formal [[dharma transmission]] or authorisation, but with a lot of life-experience. Those elder teachers were sanctioned by Jinarakkhita, and instituted new meditation-centers, and organised meetings and lectures.{{sfn|Lathouwers|2008}}{{refn|group=note|The use of lay-teachers was not new in Indonesia. In conjunction with missionaries from the [[Divine Word Missionaries]] (SVD) and the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], "lay-apostles" in the first half of the 20th century spread and practiced the Gosple.{{sfn|Missiemuseum Steyl|year unknown}} Exemplary are the Schmutzer family, who established the Catholic [[Ganjuran Church]] in Ganjuran, Bantul, Java.{{sfn|Missiemuseum Steyl|year unknown}}}}

===Death===
Jinarakkhita died on Thursday 18 April 2002 in Pluit Hospital, North Jakarta. His ashes and relics were brought back to Sakyavanaram Temple at Cipendawa Cliff, Pacet, [[Cianjur]] (between Jakarta and Bandung), [[West Java]], where Jinarakkhita lived.&lt;ref group=web name="LankaWeb" /&gt;

==Teachings==
Jinarakkhita had a liberal teaching on Buddhism.{{sfn|Lathouwers|2008}} According to Jinarakkhita, ''orang suci'' ("saints") can be found everywhere,{{sfn|Suryadinata|1995|p=48}} and religious experience is personal and unique.{{sfn|Suryadinata|1995|p=48}} Each person has to pursue his or her own path.{{sfn|Suryadinata|1995|p=48}} In his teachings he often quoted non-Buddhists, such as [[Ranggawarsita]],{{sfn|Suryadinata|1995|p=48}} and he admired [[Sai Baba of Shirdi|Sai Baba]].{{sfn|Suryadinata|1995|p=48}}&lt;ref group=web name="devotees"&gt;[http://www.indiadivine.org/showthread.php/248041-THE-DEVOTEES-OF-SAI-BABA-A-Short-Biography-of-Su-Kong The devotees of Sai Baba - A Short Biography of Su Kong]&lt;/ref&gt;

Love, as represented by [[Guanyin]], is essential:
{{quote|Duty is most important. If you practice love, there is no war, no hate. Truth is love. Buddhism is a religion of love. Jesus Christ sacrificed his Life for the sake of love. All religions are based on love.&lt;ref group=web name="devotees" /&gt;}}

==Students==
Jinarakkhita had students and followers in both Indonesia and other countries.{{sfn|Suryadinata|1995|p=48-49}} One of them is Ton Lathouwers, a Dutch lay student who received dharma transmission in the Rinzai-lineage in 1987,{{sfn|Verboven|1992}} and founded the ''Maha Karuna Ch'an'' organisation in the Netherlands.&lt;ref group=web name="MahaKaruna"&gt;[http://www.mahakarunachan.be/welkom/introduction-in-english/ Maha Karuna Ch'an] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425150903/http://www.mahakarunachan.be/welkom/introduction-in-english/ |date=25 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lennons by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]]]]
'''Bagism''' is a satire of prejudice, where by living in a bag a person could not be judged on their bodily appearance. Bagism was created by [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] as part of their extensive peace campaign in the late 1960s. The intent of bagism was to satirize [[prejudice]] and [[stereotype|stereotyping]]. Bagism involved literally wearing a bag over one's entire body. According to John and Yoko, by living in a bag, a person could not be judged by others on the basis of skin colour, gender, hair length, attire, age, or any other such attributes. It was presented as a form of total [[communication]]: instead of focusing on outward [[Human physical appearance|appearance]], the listener would hear only the bagist's [[message]].

== Purpose and origins ==

John and Yoko introduced the idea during a well-received [[press conference]] in [[Vienna]] on 31 March 1969,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/db1969.0331.beatles.html "John Lennon &amp; Yoko Ono: Bagism Press Conference 3/31/1969"], The Beatles Ultimate Experience.&lt;/ref&gt; and explained it more thoroughly in a 14 June 1969 interview with [[David Frost]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beatlesbible.com/1969/06/14/television-john-lennon-yoko-ono-david-frost-show/ "Television: John Lennon and Yoko Ono on The David Frost Show"], The Beatles' Bible.&lt;/ref&gt; Bagism reflected the whimsical, carefree, and often [[comedy|comedic]] mood of John and Yoko's other peace efforts, such as their [[Bed-In]]s. By catching the attention of the masses with its outlandish premise, bagism presented a powerful social and [[politics|political]] message to the world. As Lennon stated, "Yoko and I are quite willing to be the world's [[clowns]]; if by doing it we do some good."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iiRkfZ-UwE "John Lennon - Bagism"] Excerpt from the documentary ''Imagine: John Lennon'', (1988), YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoko said that bagism was inspired by the theme of [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]'s ''[[The Little Prince]]'', which was "One sees rightly only with the heart, the essential is invisible to the eyes."  She hoped that the bag (by hiding her and John's physical appearance) would make their essence, or the essence of their message, visible.

== The Alchemical Wedding ==

The couple had earlier appeared in a bag, at The Alchemical Wedding, an underground artists' gathering, at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] in late 1968.  The event was put on by the [[Arts Lab]] and [[BIT (infoshop)]], which sought to challenge audiences to be participants rather than passive [[consumer]]s.  John and Yoko climbed into a large white bag on stage, sat cross-legged, knee-to-knee, hunkered down and closed the bag.  They moved only twice in 45 minutes, hunkering further down.  This was a strong challenge to the audience.

"Musicians played, poets ranted, and John and Yoko crept into their white sheet-like bag on the stage and stayed there out of sight for what seemed like ages. I watched a baby crawl slowly by. And that was the bag happening. All mayhem broke out when a young female member of the audience stripped off her clothes and danced in naked delight. When the police were called and attendants tried to remove her, groups of people started stripping off their clothes in solidarity. There was a retreat and a truce was worked out, and no-one was arrested. The nude girl incident, with accompanying photo, made the front pages of the London evening papers." As [[Lee Harris (South African artist)|Lee Harris]] noted later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeharris.co.uk/LeeHarris/Works/afootsol.htm Lee Harris' involvement with the Arts Lab and Alchemical Wedding]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bagism in the songs of John Lennon ==

Bagism is mentioned three times in the songs of John Lennon.  The first time is in "[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]" where John refers to "eating chocolate cake in a bag", which was at the Vienna press conference, and the second is in the song "[[Come Together]]", where he sings: "He bag production".  This is a reference to Bag Productions Ltd, Lennon's public relations company, which derived its name from Bagism.  The third reference is in "[[Give Peace a Chance]]", with the line, "Everybody's talkin' about Bagism, Shagism, dragism, Madism, Ragism, Tagism, This-ism, That-ism, ism, ism, ism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hertzberg |first=Hendrik |date=5 July 2010 |title=Give John a Chance |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/give-john-a-chance |publisher=''[[The New Yorker]]'' |access-date=30 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet following ==

A [[website]] called [http://www.bagism.com/ Bagism] was created c. 1994 by Sam Choukri, providing John Lennon and Beatles links, photographs, rare [[sound recording]] snippets and [[video]]. At one point, c. 1996, the precursor to Bagism.com, a website focused on Lennon, was sent a [[cease and desist]] request from the representatives of his estate over copyrighted John Lennon content. After an unsuccessful [http://www.bagism.com/library/cease-n-desist/letter-to-yoko.html appeal] to Ono and the John Lennon Estate and the [http://www.bagism.com/library/cease-n-desist/dear-yoko.html Dear Yoko] [[petition]] campaign, Choukri decided to focus his efforts on less legally volatile content and the website has since been a hub for [[discussion]], detailed [[discography|discographies]], letters, [[article (publishing)|article]]s, [[fan (person)|fan]] [[Work of art|artwork]] and [[poetry]], and many other types of content.

== Recent uses ==
[[Image:Liverpool John Lennon Airport-2006-09-28.jpg|thumb|150px|John Lennon Airport, September 2006]]
In 2006, [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]] had the words "Bagism, Shagism, Dragism, Madism, Ragism, Tagism" stickered along the front windows of the airport. This was done along with the branding of various John Lennon lyrics around the inside of the airport.

In 2010, the studio band Strawberry Walrus recorded a song entitled "Bagism" and released it on their album ''This Is Not Here''.

'''Branislav Petronijević''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: Бранислав Петронијевић; 6 April 1875 – 4 March 1954) was a Serbian philosopher and scientist ([[paleontologist]]) who wrote primarily in three languages, [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]] fluently. Researched abroad and in Serbia, his major work is the two-volume, 1904-1911 ''Prinzipien der Metaphysik'' (''Principles of Metaphysics''), first published in [[Heidelberg]] in 1904. He later became a professor at the [[University of Belgrade]]. As a scientist, he was the first to distinguish between the genus ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' and the [[genus]] ''Archaeornis''; he also discovered new characteristics of the genera ''[[Tritylodon]]'' and ''[[Moeritherium]]''. Petronijević's great scientific fame, however, is nearly eclipsed by his still greater philosophical renown, which he owes to his three principal philosophical works, ''Principi Metafizike'' (Principles of Metaphysics), ''O Vrednosti života'' (About Value of Life), ''Istorija novije filozofije'' (History of a Newer Philosophy).

==Biography==

Branislav Petronijević, world-renowned Serbian philosopher and paleontologist, was born in a small village of [[Sovljak]], near [[Ub, Serbia]], on 25 March 1875, the son of a priest, originally from [[Montenegro]]. He had as a youth a taste for collecting objects of natural history and other curiosities while a student at a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (high school) in [[Valjevo]] and the [[Grande école]] in [[Belgrade]]. This led him to the study of medicine, which he went to [[Vienna]] to pursue, eventually after the third semester directing his attention to psychiatry, philosophy, biology and paleontology. Petronijević joined the Philosophical Society of the [[University of Vienna]] and studied under [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]. After years in Vienna he travelled to Germany with a view to further philosophical study. There he studied at the [[University of Leipzig]] under [[Johannes Volkelt]], [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], and [[Ernst Mach]]. With his metaphysical writings,''"Der ontologische Beweis fűr das Dasein des Absoluten"'', he proved himself a worthy student of Professor [[Wilhelm Wundt]], "the father of experimental psychology," successfully defending his thesis in 1898. From Leipzig he went back to Belgrad, where he wrote and published ''"Der Satz vom Grunde"'' in 1898. It was during this period, however, that he thought out and developed what is distinctive in his philosophical doctrine. His eclecticism, his ontology and his philosophy of history were declared in principle and in most of their salient details in the ''"Prinzipen der Metaphysik"'' (2 volumes, Heidelberg, 1904–1911) and ''"Die typischen Geometrien und das Unendliche"'' (Heidelberg, 1907).

In 1898 he was given the post of ''[[privatdozent]]'' in the [[Grande école]] of Belgrade and seven years later when his ''alma mater'' became the [[University of Belgrade]] he was appointed associate professor. At the outbreak of [[World War I]] he turned to journalism, becoming a war correspondent for the Serbian War Office Press Bureau, induced by Col. [[Dragutin Dimitrijević]], his childhood friend. In 1915 he joined the [[Serbian army's retreat through Albania (World War I)]]. After reaching Greece, he was sent to [[London]] with the Serbian Legation, along with politician [[Nikola Pašić]], geographer [[Jovan Cvijić]], professors [[Bogdan Popović]] and his brother [[Pavle Popović]].

We learn more about him in the Collected Papers of [[Bertrand Russell]], Vol. 11:

''A man who impressed me, not so much by his ability as by his resolute absorption in philosophy even under the most arduous circumstances, was the only Yugoslav philosopher of our time, whose name was Branislav Petroniević. I met him only once, in the year 1917. The only language we both knew was German and so we had to use it, although it caused people in the streets to look at us with suspicion. The Serbs had recently carried out their heroic retreat before the German invaders, and I was anxious to get a first-hand account of this retreat from him, but he only wanted to expound his doctrine that the number of points in space is finite and can be estimated by considerations derived from the theory of numbers. The consequence of this difference in our interests was a somewhat curious conversation. I said, "Were you in the great retreat?" and he replied, "Yes, but you see the way to calculate the number of points in space is." I said, "Were you on foot?" and he said, "Yes, you see the number must be a prime." I said, "Did you not try to get a horse?" and he said, "I started on a horse, but I fell off, and it should not be difficult to find out what prime." In spite of all my efforts, I could get nothing further from him about anything so trivial as the Great War. I admired his capacity for intellectual detachment from the accidents of his corporeal existence, in which I felt that few ancient Stoics could have rivalled him. After the First War he was employed by the Yugoslav Government to bring out a magnificent edition of the eighteenth-century Yugoslav philosopher Boscovic, but what happened to him after that I do not know.''

After the war he left London and went back to his teaching post at the University of Belgrade, where he was appointed extraordinary professor (1919). In 1920, he was elected into the [[Serbian Royal Academy]] and at the same time he attracted the notice of other foreign philosophers with whom he had a lively correspondence in both philosophy and science. He wrote numerous papers on philosophy and science in English, French, German, Polish and Serbian learned journals.

We see in ''"L'Évolution universelle"'' very distinctly the fusion of the different philosophical influences by which his opinions were finally matured. For Petronijević was an eclectic in thought and habit of mind as he was in philosophical principle and system. It is with the publication of the ''L'Évolution'' of 1921 in Paris that the first great widening of his reputation is associated.

Also, he undertook the task to translate [[Ruđer Bošković]]'s ''"A Theory of Natural Philosophy"'' mentioned by Russell. As far as we know, this is the first time that the work was translated from Latin to a modern language (English). It is prefaced by the "Life of Roger Joseph Boscovich," written in English by Branislav Petronijević, and an explanatory introduction by the translator. Bošković's ''"A Theory of Natural Philosophy"'' is a work of considerable importance in the history of [[physical theory]] and his [[atomic hypothesis]] were of particular interest when it was first published in London by ''Open Court Publishing Company'' in 1922.

Petronijević retired from the university in 1927. [[Ksenija Atanasijević]] was one of his [[wikt:disciple|disciple]]s. He stopped working altogether from the time the Axis invaded the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] (1941) until his death. He was staunch anti-fascist and anti-communist and could not accept the fact that Yugoslavia was dragooned behind the Iron Curtain. Perhaps for this reason he was left ignored and forgotten, like most of his post-World War I colleagues who were in sympathy with the Old Order.

His old age was spent in obscure poverty, his friends and associates having fled to the West, killed in the war, or died before him. Petronijević died in a Belgrade hotel on 4 March 1954. He was 79. He never married.

==Thought==
Petronijević was completely devoted to philosophy and science. He spent his life working never accepting any social duties. In essence he espouses the synthetic-deductive philosophy which divides the system of knowledge into three spheres: metaphysical, intermediary and empirical. He considers himself a "born metaphysician" and devotes all his efforts into building of the original system of the spiritualistic objective idealism. In that metaphysical system he introduces the theory of cognition and philosophy of nature. Using this method, he seeks to reconcile the philosophies of [[Leibnitz]] and [[Spinoza]]. In his self-designated, starting stance of a '''monopluralist''', he connects with the original '''empirical-rationalist theory of cognition''', with his own discrete geometry and philosophy of developing nature. He argues that the universe is evolving from a condition of instability towards one of absolute stability, in which there will be equilibrium in the relation between particular elements or [[monad (philosophy)|monads]] and the universal substance which underlies them. This last is the subject of a special division of philosophy, beyond metaphysics, which he calls '''hypermetaphysics'''.

Petronijević is a strict [[finitist]] in everything. As synthetic philosopher and dialectician he tries to merge primary philosophic doctrines: in [[gnoseology]], [[empirism]] and [[rationalism]]; in metaphysics, [[monadology]] and [[substantialism]]; in [[ontology]] and [[methodology]], [[dialectics]] and metaphysics (in [[Hegel]]'s sense); science and religion, science and speculation and others. His main philosophic work "''Principles of Metaphysics''" (I and II) was left undone. He believed, however, that there is a parallel between metaphysics and mathematics. With regard to the method, metaphysics remains physics, and in it lies both their strength and weakness. The motto of the first part of Petronijević's "''The Principles of Metaphysics''" (published in Heidelberg in 1904) reads: "''Exact mathematical notions are a key to the solution of the world's [[wikt:enigma|enigma]].''" These [[metaphysics]] can be [[theology]] as well—these two sciences are related—but they will never be able to give any full answers to the so-called '''ultimate questions.'''

Petronijević upheld an ethical theory of transcendental optimism and free will. He devoted a number of studies to [[aesthetics]], particularly in the work of the Serbian poet-prince-bishop [[Petar II Petrović Njegoš]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]]. 
 
Some 53 original principles, discoveries and innovations were published by him. He considered that the highest level in science he reached in mathematics, especially with his original discrete and finite geometry. Time and space are real forms of the being and the space itself is simultaneous coexistence of real points and the fragments of the being in the time. That geometry mathematicians today consider as unusual, abstruse and not strictly mathematically grounded.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Contributions to science==
In the natural sciences Petronijević published many texts in [[palaeontology]], [[biology]], [[comparative anatomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]] and the history of those sciences. His most significant results he achieved in the research of fossil birds. He discovered a number of details in the [[Archaeopteryx]] skeleton on which basis he separated the Berlin example into the new [[genus]] Archaeornis. From that fact he made important speculative conclusions about the origin, development, [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and characteristics of the early birds. After the extensive examination of five newly discovered early bird specimens all of his interpretations were abandoned. Only his real discoveries of the Archaeopteryx skeleton parts remained.
 
These parts were located with the aid of his original method of channelled deep preparation from the depth of the stone plate. The important place in the science remained for his other papers on fossil vertebrates. Petronijević's contributions to the philosophy of [[natural sciences]] are notable. Among them there are the explanation of the [[Dollo's law of irreversibility]], the introduction of his own law of '''non-correlative evolution''' and detailed explanation of various segments of universal evolution.
 
With his whole philosophical, philosophically-scientific and scientific activity Petronijević, in the line with earlier empirical and critical metaphisicists, such as [[Lotze]], [[Herbart]], [[Hartmann]], Volkelt, he directly contributed and made possible the formation of modern sphere of cognition which is today known as '''[[Metaphysics|Metascience]]'''.

==Legacy==
While Petronijević's fame rests chiefly on his labours in philosophy his palaeological studies and other scientific research are not without value in the history of [[natural science]].

By the power of his analytical and synthetic opinions, by their width and depth, than by the creativity of his intuition and especially by the consequentiality and originality of conceptions, Petronijević achieved the peak of metaphysical thought in our country. Those same qualities enabled significant achievements in science and philosophy of science to him. Because of that Petronijević garnered considerable credit in Europe and the rest of the world, which has made him one of the most important Serbian philosophers and scientists of the first half of the twentieth century. Petronijević was not an experimental physicist, he built his conceptions of the discontinuous nature of space and time logically and mathematically, and on the basis of this concept he produced a new metaphysical system for which he is known today. That is why scholars recommend that modern experimental physicists and mathematicians read the very useful books and articles of Petronijević, in which his new conceptions of ''[[time and space]]'' are expounded.

According to Miodrag Cekić, it seems that the philosophy of Branislav Petronijević may have influenced Boltzmann's late system of philosophical classification. His theory of multi-dimensions as well as the theory of mathematical discontinuity also seems to have interested both Boltzmann and Mach.

'''Brian Massumi''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|s|uː|m|i}}; born 1956) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[philosopher]] and [[Social theory|social theorist]]. Massumi's research spans the fields of [[art]], [[architecture]], [[cultural studies]], [[political theory]] and [[philosophy]]. His work explores the intersection between power, perception, and creativity to develop an approach to thought and social action bridging the aesthetic and political domains. He is a retired professor in the Communications Department of the [[Université de Montréal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.com.umontreal.ca/repertoire-departement/vue/massumi-brian/|title=Massumi Brian - Répertoire du département - Department of Communication - University of Montréal|last=http://www.fas.umontreal.ca|first=FAS -|website=en.com.umontreal.ca|language=en-CA|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Massumi was instrumental in introducing the work of French philosophers [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] to the English-speaking world through his translation of their key collaborative work ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1987) and his book ''A User's Guide to Capitalism and Schizophrenia: Deviations from Deleuze and Guattari'' (1992).&lt;ref&gt;Yves Citton, preface, ''L'Économie contre elle-même. Vers un art anti-capitaliste de l'événement'', French translaton by Armelle Chrétien of Brian Massumi, ''The Power at the End of the Economy'' (Montreal: Lux Éditeur, 2018), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; His 1995 essay "The Autonomy of Affect",&lt;ref&gt;"The Autonomy of Affect," ''Cultural Critique,'' special issue ''The Politics of Systems and Environments,'' part 2), no. 31 (September 1995), pp. 83-110.&lt;/ref&gt; later integrated into his most well-known work, ''Parables for the Virtual: Movement, Affect, Sensation'' (2002), is credited with playing a central role in the development of the interdisicplinary field of [[affect (philosophy)|affect studies]].&lt;ref&gt;''An Inventory of Shimmers,'' Gregory J. Seigworth and Melissa Gregg, ''The Affect Theory Reader,'' ed. Seigworth and Gregg (Durham : Duke University Press, 2010), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Massumi received his [[B.A.]] in Comparative Literature at [[Brown University]] (1979) and his [[Ph.D]] in French Literature from [[Yale University]]  (1987). After a Mellon postdoctoral fellowship in the [[Stanford University]] Department of French and Italian (1987-1988), he settled in Montréal, Canada, where he taught first at [[McGill University]] (Comparative Literature Program) and later at the [[Université de Montréal]] (Communication Department), retiring in 2018. Massumi has lectured widely around the world, and his writings have been translated into more than fifteen languages.

Since 2004, he has collaborated with the SenseLab,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senselab.ca/wp2 SenseLab]. Retrieved: April 17, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; founded by [[Erin Manning (theorist)|Erin Manning]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erinmovement.com Erin Manning]. Retrieved: April 17, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; as an experimental "laboratory for thought in motion" operating at the intersection of philosophy, art, and activism.

==Philosophy==

Massumi situates his work in the tradition of [[process philosophy]], which he defines broadly to encompass a range of thinkers whose work privileges concepts of event and emergence. For Massumi, this includes not only [[Alfred North Whitehead]], the philosopher most closely identified with the term, but also [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Gilbert Simondon]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], and [[Félix Guattari]].,&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, ''Politics of Affect'' (London: Polity, 2015), p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; on all of whose work he draws extensively. He articulates process philosophy with William James's [[radical empiricism]], which asserts the primacy of relation. This is the doctrine that relations are real, are directly experienced, and create their own terms.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, ''Semblance and Event: Activist Philosophy and the Occurrent Arts'' (Cambridge, M.A.: MIT Press, 2011), p. 4, 29-30, 34-37, 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Massumi has also characterized his work as "activist philiosophy" (a philosophy for which the ultimate concept is activity rather than substance&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''Semblance and Event'', op. cit., pp. 1-28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, ''The Principle of Unrest: Activist Philosophy in the Expanded Field'', (London: Open Humanities Press, 2017), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;); "speculative pragmatism" (a philosophy for which present practice bears as much on future potential as on existing functions and known utilities&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''Semblance and Event'', op. cit., p. 85-86, 179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erin Manning and Brian Massumi, ''Thought in the Act: Passages in the Ecology of Experience'' (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2014), 157.&lt;/ref&gt;); "ontogenetics" as opposed to ontology (a philosophy for which becoming is primary in relation to being&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, ''Parables for the Virtual: Movement, Affect, Sensation'' (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2002), pp. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;); and "incorporeal materialism" (a philosophy attributing abstract dimensions of reality to the body and matter itself&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''Parables for the Virtual'', op. cit., pp. 6, 11, 16-17, 76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, ''Ontopower: War, Power, and the State of Perception'' ((Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2015), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Theory of power===

Massumi's earliest work on the theory of power is two-pronged. On the one hand, it examines processes of power centralization tending toward the absolutist state, which he broadly defines as fascist.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Dean and Brian Massumi, ''First and Last Emperors: The Absolute State and the Body of the Despot'' (New York: Autonomedia, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, influenced by the work of [[Michel Foucault]], it examines processes by which power effects are distributed throughout the social field, in particular through the mass production of what he termed "low-level everyday fear."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, ed., ''The Politics of Everyday Fear'' (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[September 11 attacks|9-11 attacks]] on the World Trade Towers, his theories of distributed power focused on the doctrine of preemption promulgated by the [[George W. Bush]] administration to serve as the framework for the "war on terror."

Massumi argues that preemption is more than a military doctrine, but has engrained itself as an invasive mode of power operating in many forms throughout society.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, "Fear (The Spectrum Said)," ''Positions: East Asia Cultures Critique'', special issue, "Against Preemptive War," vol. 113, no. 1 (Spring 2005), pp.  31-48. Revised and resprinted in Massumi, ''Ontopower'', op. cit., pp. 171-188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/218091  “Potential Politics and the Primacy of Preemption,]" ''Theory and Event'',  vol. 10, no. 2 (2007). Revised and reprinted in Massumi, ''Ontopower'', op. cit., pp. 3-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, "The Future Birth of the Affective Fact: The Political Ontology of Threat," ''The Affect Theory Reader'', ed. Gregory Seigworth and Melissa Gregg (Durham: Duke University Press, 2010), pp. 52-70. Revised and reprinted in Massumi, ''Ontopower'', op. cit., pp. 189-205.&lt;/ref&gt; He sees this mode of power as paradoxically productive. He gives it the label "ontopower" (the power to bring to be).&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''Ontopower'', op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''The Power at the End of the Economy'' (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Ontopower, according to Massumi, is related to but distinct from [[Discipline and Punish|disciplinary power]] and [[biopower]] as analyzed by Foucault. It is allied Foucault's concept of "environmentality."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, "National Enterprise Emergency: Steps Toward an Ecology of Powers," ''Theory, Culture &amp; Society'', special issue Michel Foucault and Biopower, vol. 26, no. 6 (2009): 153-185. Revised and reprinted in Massumi, ''Ontopower'', op. cit., pp. 21-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Massumi analyzes ontopower as entwined with [[neoliberalism|neoliberal capitalism]]. He argues that this entwinement makes the capitalist economy a direct power formation in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, ''99 Theses on the Revaluation of Value: A Postcapitalist Manifesto'', (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that capitalist ontopower is a direct power formation that modulates the social field of emergence to capture becoming raises fundamental questions about what form political resistance and anticapitalist struggle can take. Massumi argues that there is no position "outside" capitalist power from which to critique or resist.&lt;ref&gt;"Capital Moves," ''The Principle of Unrest'', op. cit., chapter 1, pp. 7-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''99 Theses on the Revaluation of Value'', op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; The potential for political action nonetheless remains, but requires strategies of  "immanent critique" that counter-modulate the social field of emergence.&lt;ref&gt;Massumi,'' Politics of Affect'', op. cit., 71, 106-107, 110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inflexions.org/n4_t_massumihtml.html "On Critique,"] ''Inflexions: A Journal for Research Creation'',  no. 4 (January 2011), pp. 337-340  Retrieved April 18, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''The Power at the End of the Economy'', op. cit., pp. 79-95&lt;/ref&gt; These forms of resistance occur at the "micropolitical" level. The word micropolitics does not refer to the scale at which action takes place, but rather to its mode.&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, "[http://www.inflexions.org/n3_massumihtml.html Of Micropolitcs and Microperception]," ''Inflexions: A Journal for Research Creation'', no. 3 (October 2009), pp. 183-275  Retrieved April 18, 2018. Revised and reprinted in Massumi, ''Politics of Affect'', op. cit., pp. 47-82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''The Principle of Unrest'', op. cit., pp. 63-65&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of experience===

Massumi's approach to perception and the philosophy of experience is closely tied to his political philosophy through the theory of affect.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, [https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/histories-of-violence-affect-power-violence-the-political-is-not-personal/ "The Political is Not Personal,"] interview with Brad Evans, ''LA Review of Books'', November 12, 2017. Retrieved April 17, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Massumi famously distinguishes emotion from affect. Following [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], he defines affect as "the capacity to affect and be affected." This locates affect in encounters in the world, rather than the interiority of a psychological subject. Emotion, he argues, is the interiorization of affect toward psychological expression. He locates affect as such in a nonconscious "zone of indistinction" or "zone of indeterminacy" between thought and action.&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''Ontopower'', op. cit., p. 39, 204-205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''The Power at the End of the Economy'', op. cit., pp. 6-24.&lt;/ref&gt; This zone of indeterminacy is the "field of emergence" of determinate experience, but itself resists capture in functional systems or structures of meaning.

Affect's resistance to capture leaves a "remainder" of unactualized capacity that continues in the world as a "reserve" of potential available for a next determination, or "taking-form" of experience in definitive action, perception and emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, "Keywords for Affect," ''The Power at the End of the Economy'', op. cit., pp. 103-112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, "Too-Blue: Color-Patch for an Expanded Empiricism," ''Cultural Studies'', 14:2 (April 2000), pp. 253-302. Reprinted in Massumi, ''Parables for the Virtual'', op. cit., chapter 9, pp. 208-255.&lt;/ref&gt; Massumi refers to this remaindering of potential across an ongoing process of serial formation as the "autonomy" of affect &lt;ref&gt;Massumi, "The Autonomy of Affect," op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Affect is implicated in all modes of experience, including language experience, as an accompanying dimension of becoming.&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''Semblance and Event'', op. cit., chapter 4, pp. 105-179.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, all modes of experience are held together in the affective field of emergence in a state of "incipiency." The difference between modes of experience is not erased in this zone of indistinction, but is present "germinally" as a minimal differential. The modes of experience untangle from each other to come to expression divergently, actualizing different tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, ''What Animals Teach Us about Politics'' (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2014), pp. 34-35, 45-59.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of the taking-form of experience is "pulsed." Each definitive taking-form reemerges from the field of emergence after a lapse that Massumi identifies with the "missing half-second" in conscious experience experimentally verified by  neuropsychologist [[Benjamin Libet]].&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, "Autonomy of Affect," op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, "Perception Attack," ''Ontopower'', op. cit, chapter 2, pp. 63-92.&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting Whitehead, he maintains that "consciousness flickers"&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: Free Press, 1978), p. 267; cited in Massumi, ''Ontopower'', pp. 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt; Between pulses, experience returns to [[plane of immanence|immanence]] in the zone of indistinction of the field of emergence, where it is "[[priming (psychology)|primed]]" (energized and oriented) for a next taking-form.&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''Ontopower'', op. cit., chapters 3 and 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''The Power at the End of the Economy'', op. cit., chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs at the nonconscious level of "intensity" of experience.

In his later work, Massumi develops the concept of "bare activity"&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''Semblance and Event'', op. cit.,  pp. 3-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''Ontopower'', op. cit., pp. 45-49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''The Principle of Unrest'', op. cit., pp. 14, 29-34.&lt;/ref&gt; to aid in the analysis of the affective field of emergence in which modes of activity that divergently express, for example as "mental" versus "physical,""action" versus "perception," or "rational" versus "emotional," are in what he calls a state of "mutual inclusion."&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''What Animals Teach Us about Politics'', op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; (for which "co-motion," "superposition," and "reciprocal presupposition" are synonyms in Massumi's vocabulary). Mutual inclusion is the logic of immanence, which does not obey the law of the excluded middle.

The concept of mutual inclusion in bare activity has consequences for the theory of perception. It focuses the theory of perception on the interfusion of the senses (cross-modal relay or [[synesthesia]])&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''Parables for the Virtual'', chapters 6 and 7, pp. 144-176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, "The Art of the Relational Body: From Mirror-Touch to the Virtual Body," ''Mirror-Touch: Thresholds of Empathy with Art'', ed. Daria Martin. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2017), pp. 191-209.&lt;/ref&gt; and "amodal perception" (experience that is not in any particular sense mode and is in that sense "abstract").&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''Parables for the Virtual'', op. cit., 168-171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''Semblance and Event''.&lt;/ref&gt; Massumi ties amodal perception to the "[[proprioception|proprioceptive]]" experience of movement perception,&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''Parables for the Virtual'', chapters 2, 6, 7, 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, "The Art of the Relational Body," op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; and argues that the experience of movement is primary in relation to objects.&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''Parables for the Virtual'', op. cit., Introduction, pp. 1-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''Semblance and Event'', op. cit., pp. 105-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Massumi's emphasis on amodal perception gives modes of abstraction ("nonsensuous perception") a direct role in the emergence of experience. This troubles the distinction between the concrete and the abstract.&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, "Introduction: Concrete Is as Concrete Doesn't," ''Parables for the Virtual'', op. cit., pp. 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Massumi analyzes the constitutive role of abstract dimensions of reality in terms of the "reality of the virtual," expanding on Bergson's theory of the virtual as reinterpreted by Deleuze.&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''Parables for the Virtual'', op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Envisioning the Virtual," ''The Oxford Handbook of Virtuality'', ed. Mark Grimshaw (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2014), pp. 55-70.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the virtual, paradoxically, is itself actualized, in the form of a supplement of experience that he calls a "semblance." &lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''Semblance and Event'', op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; A semblance in Massumi's vocabulary is the direct experience of the abstract "dynamic form" of an event. It carries a sense of vitality ("vitality affect") uniquely associated with the event. This supplementation of sensuous experience constitutes a "surplus-value of life."

Massumi's theories reject representational accounts of thought and perception, as well as any mind/body dualism. The latter is replaced by the integral event of "bodying,"&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''What Animals Teach Us about Politics 
'', op. cit., p. 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt; coinciding with the "movement of thought."&lt;ref&gt;Massumi,"Movements of Thought," ''The Principle of Unrest'', op. cit., chapter 2, pp. 72-111&lt;/ref&gt; His emphasis on the nonconsciousness of the field of experience challenges the model of cognition in favor of a theory of "direct perception."&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''Semblance and Event'', op. cit., p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Direct perception, in his account, is performative and emergent. It expresses and transmits affective powers that exceed cognitive apprehension. Direct perception, or "pure" experience, is nevertheless addressable in a mode of awareness Massumi calls "thinking-feeling"&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, "The Thinking-Feeling of What Happens," ''Semblance and Event'', chapter 2, pp. 39-86&lt;/ref&gt; (an embodied "affective attunement"&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi and Erin Manning, "Affective Attunement in the Field of Catastrophe," in Massumi, ''Politics of Affect'', op. cit., chapter 4, pp. 112-145&lt;/ref&gt; to relation and potential that he glosses in terms of Peirce's logical category of [[abductive reasoning|abduction]]&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''The Power at the End of the Economy'', op. cit., 43-56.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Massumi argues that affect and direct perception are not confined within a human subject, but are "transindividual" and spread across the "nature–culture continuum."&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''What Animals Teach Us about Politics'',  op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, "What a Body Can Do," ''Politics of Affect'', chapter 6, pp. 177-204.&lt;/ref&gt; This qualifies his thought as a variety of [[panexperientialism]], and distances it from [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. In this connection, he has characterized his thought as an "extreme realism," by which he means a philosophy asserting the ultimate reality of qualities of experience, conceived as irreducible to either subjective [[qualia]] or objective properties, and as defying quantification.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, "Such As It Is: A Short Essay in Extreme Realism.," ''Body &amp; Society'', vol. 22, no. 1 (March 2016), pp. 115-127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, "Virtual Ecology and the Question of Value," ''General Ecology: The New Ecological Paradigm'', ed. Erich Hörl (London: Bloomsbury, 2017), pp. 345-373.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, ''99 Theses on the Revaluation of Value'', op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creativity===

Massumi works from Whitehead's notion of "creative advance," according to which the world is in a perpetual state of emergence characterized by the continual variation of form. The speculative and pragmatic aspects of his thought come together around the notion that specific practices can be developed to further this creative movement.

In collaboration with Erin Manning, Massumi has developed a process-philosophical take on research-creation.&lt;ref&gt;Manning and Massumi, "Propositions for Thought in the Act," ''Thought in the Act'', op. cit., pp. 83-152&lt;/ref&gt; Research-creation is a category in Canadian academia akin to what is called "art-based research" in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Erin Manning, "Against Method," ''The Minor Gesture'' (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2016), chapter 1, pp. 26-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Manning and Massumi extend the concept beyond the university and the specific domain of art. They advocate for an "ecology of practices" that explores how philosophical concepts formed in language can be "transduced" into other modes of experience in a way that furthers creative practice, and reciprocally, how the understanding that already imbues non-language based modes of experience can be brought to explicit expression in ways that further conceptual research. Through this two-way exchange, they see the potential to foster the emergence of new, nonstandard modes of knowledge that exceed disciplinary understanding and normative frames of perception. This affirmation of "minor" modes of thought and experience allies Manning and Massumi's vision of research-creation to the [[neurodiversity]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Erin Manning, ''The Minor Gesture'' (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

As Manning and Massumi understand it, the practice of research-creation is necessarily collective and relational,&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, "Collective Expression: A Radical Pragmatics," ''Inflexions: A Journal for Research-Creation'', "Radical Pedagogies" special issue, no. 8 (Spring 2015), pp. 59-88; revised and reprinted in Massumi, ''The Principle of Unrest'', chapter 3, pp. 111-144.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus carries a "proto-political" force of immanent critique.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi and Erin Manning, "Immediation," in Massumi, ''Politics of Affect'', chapter 5, pp. 146-176.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, "Collective Expression: A Radical Pragmatics," ''Inflexions: A Journal for Research-Creation'', "Radical Pedagogies" special issue, no. 8 (Spring 2015), pp. 59-88; revised and reprinted in Massumi, ''The Principle of Unrest'', chapter 3, pp. 111-144.&lt;/ref&gt;  Manning's SenseLab is conceived as a laboratory for the collaborative exploration of research-creation in its philosophical, aesthetic and political dimensions.

==Early life==

Massumi is the son of [[Rashid Massumi]] ([[Nain, Iran]]) from a first marriage to Elsie Szabo ([[Lorain, Ohio]]). Massumi's early childhood was spent between [[Lorain, Ohio]] and [[McLean, Virginia]]. His teenage years were spent in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], where he dedicated himself to ecological activism as part of the [[environmental movement]] of the early 1970s. His work with local and national environmental organizations on issues of wilderness preservation and land use, clean energy, and water conservation culminated in an internship in Washington, D.C. with [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]], where he specialized on the issue of shale oil development.&lt;ref&gt;''Oil Shale, Mining and Energy. Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Mines and Mining of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, House of Representatives, Ninety-Third Congress, Second Session, on H.R. 12014 and Related Bills. Congressional Record, Serial 93-46 1974'', Statement of Brian Massumi, The Wilderness Society, pp. 113-116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, "Oil Shale Country," ''Not Man Apart'' ([[Friends of the Earth]] magazine), vol. 4, no. 6 (June 1974), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disillusioned with lobbying and traditional politics, Massumi later moved toward [[direct action]] in the context of the [[anti-nuclear movement]] of the late 1970s and early 1980s. During this period, he worked within a network of anarchist [[affinity group]]s called the Coalition for Direct Action at Seabrook (CDAS),&lt;ref&gt;L.A. Kauffman, ''Direct Action: Protest and the Reinvention of American Radicalism'' (London: Verso, 2017), pp. 62-64&lt;/ref&gt; an off-shoot of the [[Clamshell Alliance]], on the organization of two occupation attempts of the [[Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant|Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant]] construction site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/08/archives/2500-protesters-are-driven-back-at-seabrook-facility-concentrate-on.html "2500 Protestors are Driven Back at Seabrook Facility]," ''New York Times'', October 7, 1979.

==Criticism==

Most critical responses to Massumi's work focus on the 1995 essay "The Autonomy of Affect" and categorize him as an "affect theorist." The distinction he makes between affect and emotion, and his assertion that affect is "autonomous" in the sense that it extends beyond linguistic signification and resists cultural coding, are particular subjects of contention.

In an influential essay, Ruth Leys&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Leys, "The Turn to Affect: A Critique," ''Critical Inquiry'', vol. 37, no. 3 (2011), pp. 434-472.&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that Massumi establishes a "false dichotomy" between mind and matter, and thinking and feeling, and disqualifies the first term of each couple. This separates the body from subjectivity, and plays into scientistic frameworks assimilating the body to inert matter. Leys argues that this undermines intentionality and rationality, which in turn make it impossible to account for ideology or to programmatically resist it. Leys further argues that Massumi's account of the "missing half-second" negates free will.

Margaret Weatherell argues that Massumi draws too gross a demarcation between bodily experience and social action and establishes a starkly polarized distinction between controlled and autonomic processes.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Wetherell, ''Affect and Emotion: A New Social Science Understanding'' (London: Sage, 2012), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In Weatherell's opinion, Massumi detours the study of affect and emotion toward particular philosophical preoccupations in ways that are "radically unhelpful" &lt;ref&gt;Wetherell, ''Affect and Emotion'', op. cit., p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and undermine a more judicious and "pragmatic"&lt;ref&gt;Wetherell, ''Affect and Emotion'', op. cit., p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; approach grounded in the social psychology literature.

Eugenie Brinkema, writing from a film theory perspective, similarly criticizes what she sees as Massumi's overreliance on the line of philosophicial thinking about affect descending from Spinoza through Deleuze. She sees Massumi imposing a "split"&lt;ref&gt;Eugenie Brinkema, ''The Forms of Affect'' (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2012), p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; between affect and emotion that cuts affect off from signification, leaving it merely "formless" and "outside structure."&lt;ref&gt;Brinkema, ''The Forms of Affect'', op. cit., p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carlo Rosselli''' (16 November 1899{{spaced ndash}}9 June 1937) was an [[Italian people|Italian]]  political leader, [[journalist]], [[historian]] and [[anti-fascist]] activist, first in [[Italy]] and then abroad. He developed a theory of [[reformist]], non-[[Marxist]] [[socialism]] inspired by the [[British Labour]] movement that he described as "[[liberal socialism]]". Rosselli founded the anti-fascist militant movement ''[[Giustizia e Libertà]]''. Rosselli personally took part in combat in the [[Spanish Civil War]] where he served on the [[Republican Faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] side.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Spencer Di Scala (1996). ''Italian socialism: between politics and history''. Boston, Massachusetts, USA: [[University of Massachusetts Press]]. p. 87. {{ISBN|1558490124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

=== Birth, war and studies ===
Rosselli was born in [[Rome]] to a wealthy [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] [[Jew]]ish family. His mother, Amelia Pincherle Rosselli, had been active in [[Republicanism|republican]] politics and thought and had participated in the [[unification of Italy]].  She was also a playwright and children's book author. In 1903 he was taken to [[Florence]] with his mother and siblings. During the [[First World War]] he joined the [[Italian armed forces]] and fought in the alpine campaign, rising to the rank of [[second lieutenant]].

After the war, thanks to his brother [[Nello Rosselli|Nello]], he studied in Florence with [[Gaetano Salvemini]], who was to be from then a constant companion of both the Rosselli brothers. It was in this period that he became a [[socialist]], sympathetic to the [[reformist]] ideas of [[Filippo Turati]], in contrast to that revolutionary thinking of [[Giacinto Menotti Serrati]]. In 1921 he graduated with a degree in political sciences from the [[University of Florence]] with a thesis titled: "sindacalismo" ([[Syndicalism]]). Later he undertook a law degree that he would pursue in [[Turin]] and [[Milan]], where he met [[Luigi Einaudi]] and [[Piero Gobetti]].

He graduated in 1923 from the [[University of Siena]]. For some weeks he visited [[London]] where he studied the workings of the [[British Labour Party]]: the English Labour movement would deeply influence him.

=== The rise of Fascism ===
An active supporter of the [[Unitary Socialist Party (Italy, 1922)|Unitary Socialist Party]] of Turati, [[Giacomo Matteotti|Matteotti]] and [[Claudio Treves|Treves]], he began writing for "[[Critica Sociale]]", a review edited by Turati. After the murder of Matteotti, Rosselli pushed for a  more active opposition to [[Fascism]]. With the help of [[Ernesto Rossi (politician)|Ernesto Rossi]] and [[Gaetano Salvemini]] he founded the clandestine publication "Non mollare" (''Don't give up''). During the following months, fascist violence towards the left became increasingly severe. Ernesto Rossi left the country for [[France]], followed by Salvemini.  In 15 February 1926 fellow activist [[Piero Gobetti]] died as an exile in [[Paris]] for the conseguences of a fascist aggression happened in [[Turin]] the year before. Still in Italy, Rosselli and [[Pietro Nenni]] founded the review "[[Quarto Stato]]", which was banned after a few  months.

Later in 1926, he organized with [[Sandro Pertini]] and [[Ferruccio Parri]] the escape of Turati to France. While Pertini followed Turati to France, Parri and Rosselli were captured and convicted for their roles in Turati's escape and sentenced to a period of confinement on the island of [[Lipari]] (1927). It is then that Rosselli began to write his most famous work, "Liberal Socialism". In July 1929 he escaped to [[Tunisia]], from where he travelled to France, and the community of Italian antifascists including [[Emilio Lussu]] and [[Francesco Fausto Nitti]]. Nitti later portrayed Rosselli's adventurous escape in the book ''Le nostre prigioni e la nostra evasione'' (''Our Prisons and Our Escape'') in an Italian edition in 1946 (the 1929 [[English language|English]] first edition was titled ''Escape'').

=== Exile in Paris: Giustizia e Libertà ===
[[File:Flag of Giustizia e Liberta.svg|thumb|right|Flag of ''[[Giustizia e Libertà]]'', an Italian anti-fascist resistance movement founded and initially led by Rosselli.]]
In 1929, with Lussu, Nitti, and a Parisian circle of refugees which had formed around Salvemini, Rosselli helped found the anti-fascist movement "[[Giustizia e Libertà]]". GL various numbers of the review and the notebooks omonimi (with cadence weekly magazine and salary) and was active in the organization of various spectacular actions,  notable among which was the flight over Milan of Bassanesi (1930). In 1930 he published, in French, "Socialisme Libéral".

The book was at once a passionate critique of [[Marxism]], a creative synthesis of the [[democratic socialist]] [[Marxist revisionism|revisionism]]  (Bernstein, Turati and Treves) and of classical Italian [[Liberalism]] ([[Benedetto Croce]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rizi |first1=Fabio Fernando |title=Benedetto Croce and Italian Fascism |date=2003 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |page=136-139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francisco Saverio Merlino and [[Gaetano Salvemini]]). But it contained also a shattering attack on the [[Stalinism]] of the [[Third International]], which had, with the derisive formula of  "socialfascism", lumped  together [[social democracy]], [[bourgeois]] [[liberalism]] and [[fascism]]. It was not surprising, therefore, when one of the most important Italian Communists, [[Palmiro Togliatti|Togliatti]], defined "liberal Socialism" "libellous anti-socialism" and Rosselli "a reactionary ideologue who has nothing to do with the working class".

Giustizia e Libertà joined the [[Concentrazione Antifascista Italiana]] (The Italian Anti-Fascist Concentration), a union of all the non-communist anti-fascist forces (republican, socialist, nationalist) trying to promote and to coordinate expatriate actions to fight fascism in Italy.  They also first published the "Giustizia e Libertà Journals".

After the advent of [[Nazism]] in [[Germany]] (1933), the paper began to call for insurgency,  revolutionary action, and military action in order to stop the Italian and German regimes before they plunge [[Europe]] into a tragic war.  [[Spain]], they wrote, seems the destiny of all fascist states.

=== The Spanish civil war ===
In July 1936 the [[Spanish Civil War]] erupted as the fascist-monarchical led army attempted a coup d'état against the republican government of the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]]. Rosselli helped lead the Italian anti-fascist supporters of the [[Spanish Republican Army|republican forces]], criticizing the neutrality policy of France and Britain, especially as Italy and Germany sent arms and troops in support of the rebels. In August, Rosselli and the GL organized its own brigades of volunteers to support the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]].

With [[Camillo Berneri]], Rosselli headed the [[Matteotti Battalion]], a mixed volunteer unit of [[anarchist]], [[Liberalism|liberal]], [[socialist]] and [[communist]] Italians.The unit was sent to the [[Aragon front]], and participated in a victory against [[Francoist]] forces in the [[Battle of Monte Pelato]]. Speaking on Barcelona Radio in November, Rosselli made famous the slogan: "Oggi in Spagna, domani in Italia" ("Today in Spain, tomorrow in Italy").

After falling ill, Rosselli was sent back to Paris, from where he led support for the anti-fascist cause, and proposed an even broader '[[popular front]]' while still remaining critical of the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] and the Soviet government of [[Joseph Stalin]]. In 1937, Berneri was killed by [[Communist]] forces during a purge of anarchists in [[Barcelona]]. With the fall of the Spanish Republic in 1939, [[Giustizia e Libertà]] [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] were forced to flee back to France.

=== Murder ===
In June 1937 Carlo Rosselli and his brother  visited the French resort town of [[Bagnoles-de-l'Orne]]. On 9 June the two were killed by a group of "''cagoulards''", militants of the "[[La Cagoule|Cagoule]]", a [[History of the far-right in France|French fascist group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stanislao G.

The two brothers were buried in the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in [[Paris]] but in the 1951 the family moved them to Italy, into the [[Cimitero di Trespiano|Monumental Cemetery of Trespiano]], a [[frazione]] of [[Florence]]

His wife Marion Cave Roselli, their three children, John, Amelia, and Andrea, and his mother Amelia Pincherle Roselli survived him.

== Thought ==
Carlo Rosselli only published a single book, "Liberal Socialism", in his life.
This work marked Rosselli out as a heretic in the Italian left of his time (for which [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Das Kapital]]'', variously interpreted, was still the bible). Undoubtedly the influence of the British labour movement, which he knew well, is visible. As a result of the electoral successes of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], Rosselli was convinced that the 'norms' of liberal democracy were essential, not only in building Socialism, but also for its concrete realization.  This stands in contrast to [[Leninist]] tactics, in which these rules, once power is taken, must be set aside. This 'Rossellian' synthesis is that "[parliamentary] liberalism is the method, Socialism is the aim".

The [[Marxist–Leninist]] idea of revolution founded on the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] (which he felt, as in the Russian case, was synonymous with the dictatorship of a single party) he rejected in favour of a revolution that—as famously put in the GL program—is a coherent system of structural reforms aimed at the construction of a Socialism; that does not limit, but indeed exalts, freedom of personality  and of association. Writing in his final years, Rosselli became more radical in his libertarian positions, defending the social organization of the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT-FAI]] he had seen in [[Anarchist Catalonia]] and Barcelona during the civil war, and informed by the rise of [[Nazi Germany]].

'''Charles Philippe Théodore Andler''' (11 March 1866, [[Strasbourg]] – 1 April 1933, [[Malesherbes, Loiret]]) was a French Germanist and philosopher.

==Life==
Andler was born to a [[Protestant Christianity|Protestant]] family in Strasbourg.&lt;ref name=Drefus&gt;Antoinette Blum, 'Charles Andler (1866-1933)', in ''L'affaire Dreyfus: dictionnaire'', 2006, p/117-120&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887 and 1888, Andler failed to achieve his ''agrégation'' in philosophy, judged by [[Jules Lachelier]], inspector-general in charge of philosophy, as showing "excessive bias" towards German philosophy. He therefore changed to take the German literature ''agrégation'' in 1889, passing out top of his class.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Alun Jones, ''The development of Durkheim's social realism'', Cambridge University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Andler became professor of German at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1901 and at the [[Collège de France]] in 1926. Amongst his works were writings on [[Nietzsche]], a commentary on ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', and a life of his friend [[Lucien Herr]].

[[File:Blessed are the Peacemakers.gif|thumb|''Blessed are the Peacemakers'' (1917) by [[George Bellows]]]]
'''Christian pacifism''' is the [[Christian theology|theological]] and [[Christian ethics|ethical]] position that any form of violence is incompatible with the Christian faith. Christian pacifists state that Jesus himself was a pacifist who taught and practiced [[pacifism]] and that his followers must do likewise. Notable Christian pacifists include [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Leo Tolstoy]],&lt;ref&gt;Colm McKeogh, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=QTEfxGLi0O4C Tolstoy's Pacifism]'', Cambria Press, 2009, {{ISBN|1-60497-634-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ammon Hennacy]]. Hennacy believed that adherence to Christianity required not just pacifism but, because governments inevitably threatened or used force to resolve conflicts, [[Christian anarchism|anarchism]]. However, most Christian pacifists, including the [[peace churches]], [[Christian Peacemaker Teams]] and individuals such as [[John Howard Yoder]], make no claim to be anarchists.

==Origins==

===Old Testament===
Roots of Christian pacifism can be found in the scriptures of the [[Old Testament]] according to Baylor University professor of religion, John A.

Lind explains the theology of warfare in ancient Israel as God directing the people of Israel to trust in Him, not in the warring way of the nations, and to seek peace not coercive power. Stephen B. Chapman expresses the Old Testament describes God's divine intervention, not human power politics, or the warring king, as key to the preservation of Israel.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Holy War in the Bible:  Christian Morality and an Old Testament Problem|last=Thomas|first=Heath A.|last2=Evans|first2=Jeremy|last3=Copan|first3=Paul|publisher=InterVarsity Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-8308-3995-7|location=Downers Grove, Illinois|pages=11|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lind asserts the Old Testament reflects that God occasionally sanctions, even commands wars to the point of God actually fighting utilizing the forces of nature, miraculous acts or other nations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Yahweh is a Warrior|date=1980|publisher=Herald Press|year=|isbn=978-0836112337|location=Scottdale, Pennsylvania|pages=25–27|quote=|via=|last1=Lind|first1=Millard C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lind further argues God fights so that Israel doesn't have to fight wars like other nations because God delivers them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; God promised to fight for Israel, to be an enemy to their enemies and oppose all that oppose them (Exodus 23:22).

Stephen Vantassel contends the Old Testament exists to put the issue of war and killing in historical and situational context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vantassel|first1=Stephen|title=Pacifism and the Bible|url=https://www.academia.edu/20651848/Pacifism_and_the_Bible_Some_Unresolved_Questions|website=Academia.edu|accessdate=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Old Testament, there is a movement in the role of war. Stephen B. Chapman, associate professor of Old Testament at Duke University asserts God used war to conquer and provide the Promised Land to Israel, and then to defend that land. The Old Testament explains that Israel does not have to fight wars like other nations because God delivers them.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Starting with the Exodus out of Egypt, God fights for Israel as a warrior rescuing His people from the oppressive Egyptians (Exodus 15:3).  In Exodus 14:13 [[Moses]] instructs the Israelites, "The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still." The miraculous parting of the Red Sea is God being a warrior for Israel through acts of nature and not human armies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  God's promise to fight on behalf of His chosen people is affirmed in the scriptures of the Old Testament (Deuteronomy 1:30).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Problem of War in the Old Testament|date=2002|publisher=Wipf and Stock|year=|isbn=1-57910-883-0|location=Eugene, OR|pages=63|quote=|via=|last1=Craige|first1=Peter C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Old Testament scholar, Peter C. Craige, during the military conquests of the Promised Land, the Israelites fought in real wars against real human enemies, however it was God who granted them victory in their battles.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Craige further contends God determined the outcome of human events with His participation through those humans and their activity; essentially God fought through the fighting of His people.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Once the Promised Land was secured, and the nation of Israel progressed, God used war to protect or punish the nation of Israel with His sovereign control of the nations to achieve His purposes (2 Kings 18:9–12, Jeremiah 25:8–9, Habakkuk 1:5–11). [[John Howard Yoder]] affirms as long as Israel trusted and followed God, God would work His power through Israel to drive occupants from lands God willed them to occupy (Exodus 23:27–33).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The future of Israel was dependent solely on its faith and obedience to God as mediated through the Law and prophets, and not on military strength.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Jacob Enz explains God made a covenant with His people of Israel, placing conditions on them that they were to worship only Him, and be obedient to the laws of life in the Ten Commandments.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Enz|first1=Jacob|title=The Christian and Warfare:  The Roots of Pacifism in the Old Testament|date=2001|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|location=Eugene, OR|isbn=1-57910-706-0|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Israel trusts and obeys God, the nation prospered; when they rebelled, God spoke through prophets such as Ezekiel and Isaiah, telling Israel that God would wage war against Israel to punish her (Isaiah 59:15-19).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lind|first1=Millard C.|title=Monotheism, Power, Justice:  Collected Old Testament Essays|date=2015|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|location=Eugene, OR|isbn=978-1498232654|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; War was used in God's ultimate purpose of restoring peace and harmony for the whole earth with the intention towards salvation of all the nations with the coming of the [[Messiah]] and a new covenant. Jacob Enz describes God's plan was to use the nation of Israel for a higher purpose, and that purpose was to be the mediator between all the peoples and God.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Old Testament reflects how God helped His people of Israel, even after Israel's repeated lapses of faith, demonstrating God's grace, not violence.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The Old Testament explains God is the only giver of life and God is sovereign over human life. Man's role is to be a steward who should take care of all of God's creation, and that includes protecting human life. Peter Craige explains God's self-revelation through His participating in human history is referred to as "[[Salvation History]]."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The main objective of God's participation is man's salvation. God participates in human history by acting through people and in the world that is both in need of salvation, and is thus imperfect.  God participates in the human activity of war through sinful human beings for His purpose of bringing salvation to the world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Studies conducted by scholars Friedrich Schwally, Johannes Pedersen, Patrick D. Miller, Rudolf Smend and Gerhard von Rad maintain the wars of Israel in the Old Testament were by God's divine command.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This divine activity took place in a world of sinful men and activities, such as war. War is considered evil. God's participation through evil human activity such as war, was for the sole purposes of both redemption and judgment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; God's presence in these Old Testament wars does not justify or deem them holy, it serves to provide hope in a situation of hopelessness.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The sixth commandment, "Thou shalt not kill" (Exodus 20:13) and the fundamental principle it holds true is that reverence for human life must be given the highest importance. The Old Testament points to a time when weapons of war shall be transformed into the instruments of peace, and the hope for the consummation of the Kingdom of God when there will be no more war.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Wood points to the scriptures of Isaiah and Micah (Isaiah 2:2-4; 9:5; 11:1-9; and Micah 4:1-7) that express the pacifist view of God's plan to bring peace without violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Early Church===
Several [[Church Fathers]] interpreted Jesus' teachings as advocating [[nonviolence]].&lt;ref&gt;Justo L.

But how will a Christian man war, nay, how will he serve even in peace, without a sword, which the Lord has taken away?

However, many early Christians also [[Christians in the military|served in the army]],&lt;ref&gt;J.

===Conversion of the Roman Empire===
{{See also|Constantine I and Christianity}}
After the Roman Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] converted in AD 312 and began to conquer "in Christ's name", Christianity became entangled with the state, and warfare and violence were increasingly justified by influential Christians. Some scholars believe that "the accession of Constantine terminated the pacifist period in church history."&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Bainton]], quoted in Robin Gill, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zk97GUVa2p0C&amp;pg=PA194 A Textbook of Christian Ethics]'', 3rd ed, Continuum, 2006, {{ISBN|0-567-03112-8}}, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the tradition of Christian pacifism was carried on by a few dedicated Christians throughout the ages, such as [[Martin of Tours]]. Martin, who was serving as a soldier, declared in 336 "I am a soldier of Christ. I cannot fight."&lt;ref name="Kurlansky"&gt;Kurlansky, Mark (2006). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RqrZAAAAMAAJ Nonviolence: Twenty-five lessons from the history of a dangerous idea]'', pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; He was jailed for this action, but later released.&lt;ref name="Kurlansky"/&gt;

Since then, many other Christians have made similar stands for [[pacifism]] as the following quotes show:

{{quote|The Scriptures teach that there are two opposing princes and two opposing kingdoms : the one is the Prince of peace ; the other the prince of strife. Each of these princes has his particular kingdom and as the prince is so is also the kingdom.

[[Charles Spurgeon]] did not explicitly identify as a pacifist but expressed very strongly worded anti-war sentiment.&lt;ref name="spurgeon"&gt;Long have I held that war is an enormous crime; long have I regarded all battles as but murder on a large scale. ''India's Ills and England's Sorrows," September 6, 1857''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian pacifist denominations==
{{Main|Peace churches}}

The first [[conscientious objector]] in the modern sense was a [[Quaker]] in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;''The New conscientious objection: from sacred to secular resistance'' Charles C. Moskos, John Whiteclay Chambers - 1993 "The first conscientious objector in the modern sense appeared in 1815. Like all other objectors from then until the 1880s, he was a Quaker.4 The government suggested exempting the pacifist Quakers, but the Storting, the Norwegian "&lt;/ref&gt; The Quakers had originally served in Cromwell's [[New Model Army]] but from the 1800s increasingly became pacifists. A number of Christian denominations have taken pacifist positions institutionally, including the [[Quaker]]s and [[Mennonite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Speicher, Sara and Durnbaugh, Donald F. (2003), Ecumenical Dictionary: [http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/who/dictionary-article8.html ''Historic Peace Churches'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace churches===
[[File:The Deserter.jpg|alt=|thumb|''The Deserter'' (1916) by [[Boardman Robinson]]]]
The term "historical peace churches" refers to three churches—the [[Church of the Brethren]], the [[Mennonites]] and the Quakers—who took part in the first peace church conference, in Kansas in 1935, and who have worked together to represent the view of Christian pacifism.

=== Anabaptist churches ===
Traditionally, [[Anabaptism|Anabaptists]] hold firmly to the their beliefs in [[nonviolence]]. Many of these churches continue to advocate nonviolence, some of which are Mennonites, the [[Amish]], the [[Hutterite]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hutterites.org/our-beliefs/summary-beliefs/|title=Summary of Beliefs|date=2012-03-15|work=Hutterites|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old Order River Brethren]] and the [[Bruderhof Communities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/bruderhof-christians-beliefs-set/2015/05/07/id/643320/|title=5 Beliefs That Set the Bruderhof Apart From Other Christians|work=Newsmax|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quakers and Shakers ===
All denominations of Quakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends, hold peace as a core value, including the refusal to participate in war&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Society-of-Friends|title=Society of Friends {{!}} religion|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; going as far as forming the [[Friends' Ambulance Unit]] with the aim of "co-operating with others to build up a new world rather than fighting to destroy the old", and the [[American Friends Service Committee]] during the two World Wars and subsequent conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Sian|title=Birmingham Remembering 1914–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shakers]], who broke away from the Quakers in 1747, did not believe that it was acceptable to kill or harm others, even in time of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/shaker/shakers.htm|title=Essay on Shaker History -- Shaker Historic Trail -- National Register of Historic Places|website=www.nps.gov|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christadelphians===
Although the group had already separated from the [[Campbellite]]s, a part of the [[Restoration Movement]], after 1848 for theological reasons as the "Royal Assembly of Believers", among other names, the "[[Christadelphians]]" formed as a church formally in 1863 in response to [[conscription]] in the [[American Civil War]]. They are one of the few churches to have been legally formed over the issue of Christian pacifism.&lt;ref&gt;Lippey C. ''The Christadelphians in North America''&lt;/ref&gt; The British and Canadian arms of the group adopted the name "Christadelphian" in the following year, 1864, and also maintained objection to military service during the First and Second World Wars. Unlike Quakers, Christadelphians generally refused all forms of military service, including stretcher bearers and medics, preferring non-uniformed civil hospital service.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan R. Wilson]] ''Sects and Society'' 1961&lt;/ref&gt;

===Churches of God (7th day)===
The different groups evolving under the name [[Church of God (7th day)]] stand opposed to carnal warfare, based on Matthew 26:52; Revelation 13:10; Romans 12:19-21. They believe the weapons of their warfare to not be carnal but spiritual (II Corinthians 10:3-5; Ephesians 6:11-18).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofgod-7thday.org/Publications/Doctrinal%20Points%20Final%20Proof.pdf|title=Doctrinal Points of the Church of God (7th Day)|publisher=|accessdate=October 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cog7day.org/about/index.asp?pgID=11|title=Church of God 7th Day|website=www.cog7day.org|accessdate=October 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doukhobors===
The [[Doukhobors]] are a [[Spiritual Christian]] denomination that advocate pacifism.&lt;ref name="Guides2016"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rough Guide to Canada|date=1 June 2016|publisher=Apa Publications|language=English|isbn=9780241279526|page=957|quote=The Doukhobors were a sect who fled southern Russian in 1899 after being persecuted for their religious and political views.

===Molokans===
The [[Molokan]]s are a [[Spiritual Christian]] denomination that advocate pacifism.&lt;ref name="Hennacy2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hennacy|first=Ammon|title=The Book of Ammon|date=1 May 2010|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781608990535|page=406|quote=Molokan means “Milk Drinker.” This name was given the Molokans in Russia by the Orthodox, because they were dissidents from the regular church, led communal lives, and were pacifists.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have historically been [[persecution of Christians|persecuted]] for failing to bear arms.&lt;ref name="Waters1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Waters|first=Tony|title=Crime and Immigrant Youth|date=31 March 1999|publisher=SAGE Publications|language=English |isbn=9781452263373|page=37|quote=The Molokan Russians were an ascetic religious sect of the Russian Orthodox Church that settled in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1904-1906. Their religious ideals included pacifism; indeed, the demands of the Russian draft for the Russian-Japanese War were cited as the cause of their flight from Russia in the first place.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seventh-day Adventists===
During the American Civil War in 1864, shortly after the formation of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], the Seventh-day Adventists declared, "The denomination of Christians calling themselves Seventh-day Adventists, taking the Bible as their rule of faith and practice, are unanimous in their views that its teaching are contrary to the spirit and practice of war; hence, they have ever been conscientiously opposed to bearing arms."&lt;ref&gt;F.M. Wilcox, Seventh-day Adventists in Time of War, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general Adventist movement from 1867 followed a policy of [[conscientious objection]]. This was confirmed by the Seventh-day Adventist Church in 1914. The official policy allows for military service in [[Non-combatant|non-combative roles]] such as medical corps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apfn.org/thewinds/1998/11/project_whitecoat.html|title=Seventh-day Adventists and Project Whitecoat|publisher=|accessdate=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; much like Seventh-day Adventist [[Desmond Doss]] who was the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor and one of only three so honored, and other supportive roles which do not require to kill or carry a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.adventistreview.org/2003-1535/story5.html|title=Adventist Review: BETWEEN PACIFISM AND PATRIOTISM|publisher=|accessdate=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian pacifism in action==
From the beginning of the [[First World War]], Christian pacifist organizations emerged to support Christians in denominations other than the historic peace churches. The first was the interdenominational [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] ("FoR"), founded in Britain in 1915 but soon joined by sister organizations in the U.S. and other countries. Today pacifist organizations serving specific denominations are more or less closely allied with the FoR: they include the [[Methodist Peace Fellowship]] (established in 1933), the [[Anglican Pacifist Fellowship]] (established in 1937), [[Pax Christi]] ([[Roman Catholic]], established in 1945), and so forth. The Network of Christian Peace Organisations (NCPO) is a UK-based ecumenical peace network of 28 organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ncpo.org.uk/about-the-ncpo |title=Network of Christian Peace Organisations |author= |authorlink= |year= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these organizations do not take strictly pacifist positions, describing themselves instead as advocating [[nonviolence]], and some either have members who would not consider themselves Christians or are explicitly interfaith. However, they share historical and philosophical roots in Christian pacifism.

In some cases Christian churches, even if not necessarily committed to Christian pacifism, have supported particular campaigns of [[nonviolent resistance]], also often called [[civil resistance]]. Examples include the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (a grouping of churches in the southern United States) in supporting the [[Civil Rights Movement]]; the Chilean Catholic Church's support for the civic action against authoritarian rule in [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|Pinochet's Chile]] in the 1980s; and the Polish Catholic Church's support for the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity movement]] in Poland in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present''], Oxford University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-955201-6}}, pp. 58-74, 127-143 and 197-212.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Wink]] writes that "There are three general responses to evil: (1) passivity, (2) violent opposition, and (3) the third way of militant nonviolence articulated by Jesus. Human evolution has conditioned us for only the first two of these responses: fight or flight."&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Wink]], writing in Roger S.

===First World War===
[[Ben Salmon]] was an American Catholic pacifist and outspoken critic of [[just war theory]], as he believed all war to be unjust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=All Saints: Daily Reflections on Saints, Prophets, and Witnesses for Our Time|year=1997|author=Robert Ellsberg|page=77|url=http://www.gratefulness.org/giftpeople/salmon.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[First World War]], Salmon was arrested for refusing to complete a [[Selective Service System|Selective Service]] and report for induction. He was court-martialed at [[Camp Dodge]], Iowa on July 24, 1918, and sentenced to death.

The [[Anglicanism|Episcopal]] bishop [[Paul Jones (bishop)|Paul Jones]], who had associated himself with the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] and had been quite outspoken in his opposition to the war, was forced to resign his Utah see in April 1918.

In 1918, four Hutterite brothers from [[South Dakota]], Jacob Wipf and David, Joseph and Michael Hofer were imprisoned at Alcatraz for refusing to fight in military or put on a military uniform; Joseph and Michael Hofer died in late 1918 at [[Fort Leavenworth]], [[Kansas]], due to the harsh conditions of the imprisonment &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.plough.com/en/topics/faith/anabaptists/the-martyrs-of-alcatraz|title=The Martyrs of Alcatraz|work=Plough|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Remembering Muted Voices symposium  in October 2017, the lives and witness of World War I peace activists, including the four [[Hutterite]] brothers, were remembered.

===Second World War===
The French Christian pacifists [[André and Magda Trocmé]] helped conceal hundreds of Jews fleeing the Nazis in the village of [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon]].&lt;ref name="pph"&gt;''Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed: The Story of Le Chambon and How Goodness Happened There'' Philip P.

In his early years as a writer of ''The Necessity of Pacifism'' (1937) and as editor of the weekly London newspaper, ''[[Peace News]]'', he argued that Nazi Germany, should be allowed retain control of mainland Europe, arguing Nazism was a lesser evil compared to the horrors of a [[total war]].&lt;ref name="jomh"&gt;Richard A.

[[Vera Brittain]] was another British Christian pacifist. She worked as a [[Civil Defence Service|fire warden]] and by travelling around the country raising funds for the [[Peace Pledge Union]]'s food relief campaign. She was vilified for speaking out against the [[area bombardment|saturation bombing]] of German cities through her 1944 booklet ''Massacre by Bombing''. Her principled pacifist position was vindicated somewhat when, in 1945, the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi's]] [[The Black Book|Black Book]] of 2000 people to be immediately arrested in Britain after a [[Operation Sea Lion|German invasion]] was shown to include her name.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Paul and Bostridge, Mark, ''Vera Brittain: A Life'', 1995, {{ISBN|0-7011-2679-5}}  (p. 445).&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Brittain worked for ''[[Peace News]]'' magazine, "writing articles against [[apartheid]] and [[colonialism]] and in favour of [[nuclear disarmament]]" from a Christian perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Loretta Stec, "Pacifism, Vera Brittain, and India".

===War tax resistance===
Opposition to war has led some, like [[Ammon Hennacy]], to a form of [[tax resistance]] in which they reduce their income below the [[Income tax threshold|tax threshold]] by taking up a [[simple living]] lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwtrcc.org/anarchists.php|title=Anarchists and War Tax Resistance|publisher=[[National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee]] (NWTRCC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NWTRCC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwtrcc.org/practical5.php|title=Low Income/Simple Living as War Tax Resistance|publisher=NWTRCC}}&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals believe that their government is engaged in immoral, unethical or destructive activities such as war, and paying taxes inevitably funds these activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwtrcc.org/what_is_wtr.php|title=What is War Tax Resistance?|publisher=NWTRCC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{evolutionary biology}}

In [[phylogenetics]], the '''crown group''' of a collection of [[species]] consists of the living representatives of the collection together with their ancestors back to their [[most recent common ancestor]] as well as all of that ancestor's descendants. It is thus a [[clade]], a group consisting of a species and all its descendants.

The concept was developed by [[Willi Hennig]], the formulator of [[cladistics|phylogenetic systematics]], as a way of classifying living organisms relative to their extinct relatives in his "Die Stammesgeschichte der Insekten",&lt;ref name=Hennig1969&gt;{{citation
 | author = Hennig, W.
 | year = 1969
 | title = Die Stammesgeschichte der Insekten
 |publisher = Waldemar Kramer, Frankfurt am Main
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the "crown" and "stem" group terminology was coined by R. P. S. Jefferies in 1979.&lt;ref name=Jefferies1979&gt;{{Cite book

==Contents of the crown group==
It is not necessary for a species to have living descendants in order for it to be included in the crown group. Extinct side branches on the [[family tree]] that are descended from the most recent common ancestor of living members will still be part of a crown group. For example, if we consider the crown-birds (i.e. all [[Extant taxon|extant]] birds and the rest of the family tree back to their most recent common ancestor), extinct side branches like the [[dodo]] or [[great auk]] are still descended from the most recent common ancestor of all living [[bird]]s, so fall within the bird crown group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DNA yields dodo family secrets|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2002-02-28|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1847431.stm|accessdate=2006-09-07 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; One very simplified cladogram for birds is shown below:&lt;ref name="chiappe2007"&gt;{{Citation|last=Chiappe |first=Luis M. |year=2007 |title=Glorified Dinosaurs: The Origin and Early Evolution of Birds |location=Sydney |publisher=University of New South Wales Press |isbn=978-0-86840-413-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this diagram, the clade labelled "Neornithes" is the crown group of birds: it includes the most recent common ancestor of all living birds and its descendants, living or not. Although considered to be birds (i.e. members of the clade Aves), ''Archaeopteryx'' and other extinct groups are not included in the crown group, as they fall outside the Neornithes clade, being descended from an earlier ancestor.

An alternative definition does not require any members of a crown group to be extant, only to have resulted from a "major cladogenesis event".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=UCMP Glossary: Phylogenetics |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/glossary_1.html |accessdate=2010-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first definition forms the basis of this article.

Often, the crown group is given the designation "crown-", to separate it from the group as commonly defined. Both [[birds]] and [[mammals]] are traditionally defined by their traits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=ed|first=Rob Nagel,|title=U-X-L encyclopedia of science.|year=2001|publisher=U-X-L|location=Detroit|isbn=0787654329|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benton|first=Michael J.|title=Vertebrate palaeontology|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Science|location=Oxford|isbn=0632056371|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contain fossil members that lived before the last common ancestors of the living groups or, like the mammal ''[[Haldanodon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Luo, Zhe-Xi |title=Transformation and diversification in early mammal evolution |journal=Nature |volume=450 |issue=7172 |pages=1011–1019 |year=2007 |pmid=18075580 |doi=10.1038/nature06277 |url=http://carnegiemnh.net/assets/science/vp/Luo%202007%20%28Mesozoic%20mammal%20review%29%5B1%5D.pdf |bibcode=2007Natur.450.1011L |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124020009/http://carnegiemnh.net/assets/science/vp/Luo%202007%20%28Mesozoic%20mammal%20review%29%5B1%5D.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; were not descended from that ancestor although they lived later. Crown-Aves and Crown-Mammalia therefore differ slightly in content from the common definition of Aves and Mammalia. This has caused some confusion in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Jason S.|title=Use of Well-Known Names in Phylogenetic Nomenclature: A Reply to Laurin|journal=Systematic Biology|year=2002|volume=51|issue=5|pages=822–827|doi=10.1080/10635150290102447|url=http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/51/5/822.full.pdf|accessdate=28 December 2011|pmid=12396594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laurin | first1 = M. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = J.S. | year = 2004 | title = Meaning of the Name Tetrapoda in the Scientific Literature: An Exchange | url = http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/1/68.full?ijkey=a1c64aaf1d9e71d364ae3e5f1299f6b4315851c5&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha | journal = Systematic Biology | volume = 53| issue = | pages = 68–80 | doi = 10.1080/10635150490264716 | pmid=14965901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other groups under the crown group concept==
The cladistic idea of strictly using the topology of the [[phylogenetic tree]] to define groups, necessitates other definitions than crown groups to adequately define commonly discussed fossil groups like various [[Burgess Shale]] fauna. Thus, a host of [[prefix]]es have been defined to describe various branches of the phylogenetic tree relative to extant organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Craske, A. J. &amp; Jefferies, R. P. S. (1989): A new mitrate from the Upper Ordovician of Norway, and a new approach to subdividing a plesion. ''Palaeontology'' no 32, pages 69–99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pan-group===
A '''pan-group''' or '''total group''' is the crown group and all organisms more closely related to it than to any other [[extant taxon|extant]] organisms. In a tree analogy, it is the crown group and all branches back to (but not including) the split with the closest branch to have living members. The Pan-Aves thus contain the living birds and all (fossil) organisms more closely related to birds than to [[crocodilian]]s (their closest living relatives). The phylogenetic lineage leading back from [[Neornithes]] to the point where it merges with the crocodilian lineage, along with all side branches, constitutes pan-birds. In addition to non-crown group primitive birds like ''Archaeopteryx'', ''[[Hesperornis]]'' and ''[[Confuciusornis]]'', therefore, pan-group birds would include all [[dinosaur]]s and [[pterosaur]]s as well as an assortment of non-crocodilian animals like ''[[Marasuchus]]''.

Pan-Mammalia consists of all mammals and their fossil ancestors back to the phylogenetic split from the remaining [[amniotes]] (the [[Sauropsida]]). Pan-Mammalia is thus an alternative name for [[Synapsida]].

{{redirect|Stem group|stem groups in mathematics|isoclinism of groups}}
===Stem groups===
A '''stem group''' is a [[paraphyletic]] group composed of a pan-group or total group, above, ''minus'' the crown group itself (and therefore minus all living members of the pan-group). This leaves primitive relatives of the crown groups, back along the phylogenetic line to (but not including) the [[last common ancestor]] of the crown group and their nearest living relatives. It follows from the definition that all members of a stem group are extinct. The "stem group" is the most used and most important of the concepts linked to crown groups, as it offers a purely phylogenetic route to classify fossils that otherwise do not fit into systematics based on living organisms.

While often attributed to Jefferies (1979), Willmann (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Willmann|first=Rainer|title=From Haeckel to Hennig:  the early development of phylogenetics in German-speaking Europe|journal=Cladistics |year=2003|volume=19|pages=449–479|doi=10.1016/j.cladistics.2003.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; traced the origin of the stem group concept to German systematist Othniel Abel (1914)
,&lt;ref name=Abel1914&gt;{{citation
 | author = Abel, O.
 | year = 1914
 | title = Die vorzeitlichen Saugetiere
 |publisher = G. Fischer Verlag, Jena
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was discussed and diagrammed in English as early as 1933 by [[Alfred Romer|A. S. Romer]].&lt;ref name=Romer1933&gt;{{citation
 | author = [[Alfred Romer|Romer, A.S.]]

 |publisher = University of Chicago Press, Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, the term "stem group" is sometimes used in a narrower sense to cover just the members of the traditional taxon falling outside the crown group. Permian synapsids like ''[[Dimetrodon]]'' and ''[[Anteosaurus]]'' are stem mammals in the wider sense but not in the narrower one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Czaplewski|first=Terry A. Vaughan, James M. Ryan, Nicholas J.|title=Mammalogy|year=2000|publisher=Brooks/Cole Thomson Learning|location=Fort Worth|isbn=003025034X|page=61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LD1nDlzXYicC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=Thrinaxodon+jaw+joint&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fyNh_jXDhU&amp;sig=Axq3-lnEd_OjGxTO8DjWU9QWrEs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FCX0UemnEcSm4ATQ-oGIAg&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=Stem%20mammals&amp;f=false|edition=4th|accessdate=27 July 2013|quote=From a [[cynodont]] ancestry, the stem mammals arose in the late Triassic, slightly after the first appearance of dinosaurs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples of stem groups (in the wider sense)====
'''Stem birds''' perhaps constitute the most cited example of a stem group, as the phylogeny of this group is fairly well known.

The crown group here is [[Neornithes]], all modern bird lineages back to their last common ancestor. The closest living relatives of birds are [[crocodilian]]s. If we follow the phylogenetic lineage leading to Neornithes to the left, the line itself and all side branches belong to the stem birds until the lineage merges with that of the crocodilians. In addition to non-crown group primitive birds like ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', ''[[Hesperornis]]'' and ''[[Confuciusornis]]'', stem group birds include the [[dinosaurs]] and the [[pterosaurs]]. The last common ancestor of birds and crocodilians—the first crown group archosaur—was neither bird nor crocodilian and possessed none of the features unique to either. As the bird stem group evolved, distinctive bird features such as feathers and hollow bones appeared. Finally, at the base of the crown group, all traits common to extant birds were present.

'''Stem mammals''' are those in the lineage leading to living mammals, together with side branches, from the divergence of the lineage from the Sauropsida to the last common ancestor of the living mammals. This group includes the [[synapsid]]s as well as [[Mammaliaformes|mammaliaforms]] like the [[Morganucodonta|morganucodonts]] and the [[Docodonta|docodonts]]; the latter groups are traditionally and anatomically been considered mammals even though they fall outside the crown group mammals.&lt;ref name=Romer&gt;[[Alfred Romer|Romer, A.S.]] (1966): Vertebrate Paleontology. University of Chicago Press, Chicago; 3rd edition {{ISBN|0-7167-1822-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Stem Tetrapoda|Stem tetrapods]]''' are the animals belonging to the lineage leading to [[tetrapod]]s from their divergence from the [[lungfish]], our nearest relatives among the fishes. In addition to a series of [[lobe-finned fishes]], they also include some of the early [[labyrinthodontia|labyrinthodonts]]. Exactly what labyrinthodonts are in the stem group tetrapods rather than the corresponding crown group is uncertain, as the phylogeny of early tetrapods is not well understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marjanović|first=David|author2=Laurin, Michel|title=The origin(s) of extant amphibians: a review with emphasis on the "lepospondyl hypothesis"|journal=Geodiversitas|date=1 March 2013|volume=35|issue=1|pages=207–272|doi=10.5252/g2013n1a8|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.5252/g2013n1a8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This example shows that crown and stem group definitions are of limited value when there is no consensus phylogeny.

'''Stem arthropods''' constitute a group that has seen attention in connection with the [[Burgess Shale]] fauna. Several of [[fossils of the Burgess Shale|the finds]], including the enigmatic ''[[Opabinia]]'' and ''[[Anomalocaris]]'' have some, though not all, features associated with [[arthropod]]s, and are thus considered stem arthropods.&lt;ref name="Budd1996"&gt;{{Citation

'''Stem priapulids''' are other early Cambrian to middle Cambrian faunas, appearing in Chengjiang to Burgess Shale. The genus ''[[Ottoia]]'' has more or less the same build as modern [[priapulida|priapulids]], but phylogenetic analysis indicates that it falls outside the crown group, making it a stem priapulid.&lt;ref name=Budd2000/&gt;

===Plesion-group===
The name ''plesion'' has a long history in biological systematics, and '''plesion group''' has acquired several meanings over the years. One use is as "nearby group" (plesion means ''close to'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]), i.e. [[sister group]] to a given [[taxon]], whether that group is a crown group or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patterson|first=C.|author2=Rosen, D.E.|title=Review of ichthyodectiform and other Mesozoic teleost fishes and the theory and practice of classifying fossils|journal=Bulletine of American Natural History|year=1977|volume=158|issue=2|pages=85–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term may also mean a group, possibly [[paraphyletic]], defined by primitive traits (i.e. [[symplesiomorphy|symplesiomorphies]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kluge|first=N.|title=Modern Systematics of Insects. Part I. Principles of Systematics of Living Organisms and General System of Insects, with Classification of Primary Wingless and Paleopterous Insects|year=2000|publisher=Lan'|location=St. Petersburg, Russland|pages=336|url=http://www.insecta.bio.pu.ru/z/syst_I_2.htm|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally taken to mean a side branch splitting off earlier on the phylogenetic tree than the group in question.

==Palaeontological significance of stem and crown groups==
Placing [[fossil]]s in their right order in a stem group allows the order of these acquisitions to be established, and thus the ecological and functional setting of the evolution of the major features of the group in question.  Stem groups thus offer a route to integrate unique palaeontological data into questions of the evolution of living organisms.  Furthermore, they show that fossils that were considered to lie in their own separate group because they did not show all the diagnostic features of a living clade, can nevertheless be related to it by lying in its stem group.  Such fossils have been of particular importance in considering the origins of the [[tetrapods]], [[mammals]], and [[animal]]s.

The application of the stem group concept also influenced the interpretation of the organisms of the [[Burgess shale]]. Their classification in stem groups to extant phyla, rather than in phyla of their own, is thought by some to make the [[Cambrian explosion]] easier to understand without invoking unusual evolutionary mechanisms;&lt;ref name=Brysse2008&gt;{{citation

Overemphasis on the stem group concept threatens to delay or obscure proper recognition of new higher taxa.&lt;ref name="Paramphibia2015"&gt;{{ cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stem groups in systematics==
As originally proposed by [[Karl-Ernst Lauterbach]], stem groups should be given the prefix "stem" (i.e. Stem-Aves, Stem-Arthropoda), however the crown group should have no prefix.&lt;ref&gt;Lauterbach, K-E. (1989): Das Pan-Monophylum – ein Hilfsmittel für die Praxis der Phylogenetischen Systematik. ''Zoologischer Anzeiger'', no 223, pp 139–156.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter has not been universally accepted for known groups. A number of [[Paleontology|paleontologists]] have opted to apply this approach anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Gauthier, J., and de Queiroz, K. (2001). "Feathered dinosaurs, flying dinosaurs, crown dinosaurs, and the name Aves." Pp. 7-41 in ''New perspectives on the origin and early evolution of birds: proceedings of the International Symposium in Honor of John H. Ostrom'' (J. A. Gauthier and L. F. Gall, eds.).

Although dwarfed by other, larger communities, the Druze community played an important role in shaping the history of the [[Levant]], and continues to play a large political role there. As a religious minority in every country they live in, they have frequently experienced [[persecution]], except in [[Lebanon]] and [[Israel]] where Druze judges, parliamentarians, diplomats, and doctors occupy the highest echelons of society. Even though the faith originally developed out of [[Ismaili Islam]], Druze are not considered [[Muslims]], although [[Al Azhar]] of Egypt recognizes them as one of the [[Islamic schools and branches|Islamic sects]] akin to [[Shiite Muslims]].&lt;ref name=mordechai&gt;{{cite book|title=Minorities in the Middle East: A History of Struggle and Self-Expression|last=Nisan|first=Mordechai|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5133-3|date=2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=randa&gt;{{cite book|title=The Arab Americans|last=Kayyali |first=Randa|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33219-7|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=david&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Security Watch-Lebanon: A Reference Handbook: A Reference Handbook|last=Sorenson|first=David|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-36579-9|date=2009-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=muhammed&gt;{{cite book|title=Islam: Questions And Answers — Schools of Thought, Religions and Sects|last=Abdul-Rahman|first=Muhammed Saed|publisher=AMSA Publication Limited|isbn=978-5-551-29049-0|date=December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] Caliph [[Ali az-Zahir]], whose father al-Hakim is a key figure in the Druze faith, was particularly harsh, causing the death of many Druze in [[Antioch]], [[Aleppo]], and northern Syria.

The Druze faith is one of the [[Major religious groups#World Religion Database|major religious groups]] in the Levant, with between 800,000 and a million adherents. They are found primarily in [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Israel]], with small communities in [[Jordan]] and outside Southwestern Asia.

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
The name Druze is derived from the name of [[Ad-Darazi|Muhammad bin Ismail Nashtakin ad-Darazī]] (from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''{{transl|fa|darzi}}'', "seamster") who was an early [[preacher]]. Although the Druze consider ad-Darazī a [[heretic]],&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.druze.ca/AboutDruze.html |title=About the Faith of The Mo'wa'he'doon Druze |first=Moustafa F |last=Moukarim |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426105258/http://www.druze.ca/AboutDruze.html |archivedate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the name has been used to identify them.

Before becoming public, the movement was secretive and held closed meetings in what was known as [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah#Sessions of Wisdom|Sessions of Wisdom]]. During this stage a dispute occurred between ad-Darazi and [[Hamza bin Ali]] mainly concerning ad-Darazi's ''{{transl|ar|[[ghulat|ghuluww]]}}'' ("exaggeration"), which refers to the belief that God was [[incarnation|incarnated]] in human beings (especially '[[Ali]] and his descendants, including [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], who was the [[caliph]] at the time) and to ad-Darazi naming himself "The Sword of the Faith", which led Hamza to write an epistle refuting the need for the sword to spread the faith and several epistles refuting the beliefs of the ''{{transl|ar|[[ghulat]]}}''.

In 1016 ad-Darazi and his followers openly proclaimed their beliefs and called people to join them, causing riots in Cairo against the Unitarian movement including Hamza bin Ali and his followers. This led to the suspension of the movement for one year and the expulsion of ad-Darazi and his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Al-Darazî and Ḥamza in the Origin of the Druze Religion |last=Hodgson |first=Marshall G. S. |journal=[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]] |issn=0003-0279 |volume=82 |issue=1 |year=1962 |pages=5–20 |doi=10.2307/595974 |jstor=595974 |via=[[JSTOR]] |registration=y|bibcode=1964JAOS...84..128H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Druze religious books describe ad-Darazi as the "insolent one" and as the "calf" who is narrow-minded and hasty, the name "Druze" is still used for identification and for historical reasons. In 1018 ad-Darazi was assassinated for his teachings; some sources claim that he was executed by Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;&lt;ref name=samy&gt;{{cite book|title= The Druzes: An Annotated Bibliography |last=Swayd|first=Samy |publisher=ISES Publications|location=Kirkland, WA, USA|year=1998|isbn=978-0-9662932-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authorities see in the name "Druze" a descriptive epithet, derived from Arabic ''{{transl|ar|dārisah}}'' ("she who studies").{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=605}} Others have speculated that the word comes from the Persian word ''{{transl|fa|Darazo}}'' ({{lang|fa|درز}} "bliss") or from [[Shaykh]] Hussayn ad-Darazī, who was one of the early converts to the faith.&lt;ref name = najjar /&gt; In the early stages of the movement, the word "Druze" is rarely mentioned by historians, and in Druze religious texts only the word ''Muwaḥḥidūn'' ("Unitarian") appears. The only early Arab historian who mentions the Druze is the eleventh century Christian scholar [[Yahya of Antioch]], who clearly refers to the heretical group created by ad-Darazī rather than the followers of Hamza ibn 'Alī.&lt;ref name=najjar&gt;{{cite book |last=Al-Najjar |first='Abdullāh |title=Madhhab ad-Durūz wa t-Tawḥīd (The Druze Sect and Unism) |publisher=Dār al-Ma'ārif |location=Egypt |year=1965 |language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for Western sources, [[Benjamin of Tudela]], the Jewish traveler who passed through Lebanon in or around 1165, was one of the first European writers to refer to the Druzes by name. The word ''{{transl|he|Dogziyin}}'' ("Druzes") occurs in an early Hebrew edition of his travels, but it is clear that this is a scribal error. Be that as it may, he described the Druze as "mountain dwellers, monotheists, who believe in 'soul eternity' and [[reincarnation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hitti |first=Philip K |title=Origins of the Druze People and Religion, with Extracts from their Sacred Writings |edition=new |series=Columbia University Oriental Studies |volume=28 |publisher=Saqi |location=London |year=2007 |origyear=1924 |isbn=978-0-86356-690-5 |pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that "they loved the Jews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mordechai Nisan|title=Minorities in the Middle East: A History of Struggle and Self-Expression, 2d ed.|date=1 Jan 2002|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5133-3|page=283}}&lt;!--|accessdate=21 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early history ===
The Druze faith began as a movement in [[Ismailism]] that was opposed to certain religious and philosophical ideologies that were present during that epoch.

The faith was preached by [[Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad|Hamza ibn 'Alī ibn Ahmad]], an [[Ismaili]] mystic and scholar. He came to [[Egypt]] in 1014 and assembled a group of scholars and leaders from across the world to establish the Unitarian movement. The order's meetings were held in the Raydan Mosque, near the [[Al-Hakim Mosque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|format=PDF |url=http://www.druze.com/education/DruzeLuminariesAlHakim-English-level3.pdf |publisher=Druze |title=Luminaries: Al Hakim |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820044553/http://www.druze.com/education/DruzeLuminariesAlHakim-English-level3.pdf |archivedate=20 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1017, Hamza officially revealed the Druze faith and began to preach the Unitarian doctrine. Hamza gained the support of the Fātimid caliph [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-Hakim]], who issued a decree promoting religious freedom prior to the declaration of the [[divine call]].

Al-Hakim became a central figure in the Druze faith even though his own religious position was disputed among scholars. [[John Esposito]] states that al-Hakim believed that "he was not only the divinely appointed religio-political leader but also the [[nous|cosmic intellect]] linking God with creation",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lZXTFCN93kkC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=druze+hakim+John+Esposito#PPA156,M1 |title=Melville's Clarel and the Intersympathy of Creeds |first=William |last=Potter |page=156|isbn=9780873387972 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others like Nissim Dana and [[Mordechai Nisan]] state that he is perceived as the manifestation and the reincarnation of God or presumably the image of God.{{Sfn|Nisan|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=keD9z1XWuNwC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Mordechai+Nisan++druze&amp;ei=IJ5uSLuLMZOkiwHp99SCBg&amp;sig=ACfU3U2QHNki1phQdaWTIOKngGyVPLnTbw#PPA100,M1 95]}}{{Sfn |Dana|2003}}{{Rp|needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

Some Druze and non-Druze scholars like Samy Swayd and [[Sami Makarem]] state that this confusion is due to confusion about the role of the early preacher ad-Darazi, whose teachings the Druze rejected as heretical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=H-k9oc9xsuAC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=The+Druzes:+A+New+Study+of+Their+History,+Faith+and+Society+Al-Hakim#PPA217,M1 |title=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia |first1=Josef W |last1=Meri |first2=Jere L |last2=Bacharach |publisher=Routledge |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-415-96690-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sources assert that al-Hakim rejected ad-Darazi's claims of divinity,&lt;ref name= samy /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kY0oedX32BwC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=Hamza+bin+Ali+druze#PPA127,M1 |title=The Olive and the Tree: The Secret Strength of the Druze |first1=Dr Ruth |last1=Westheimer |first2=Gil |last2=Sedan|isbn=9781590561027 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Swayd|2006}}{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}} and ordered the elimination of his movement while supporting that of Hamza ibn Ali.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url =https://books.google.com/?id=rezD7rvuf9YC&amp;pg=PA921&amp;vq=druze&amp;dq=druze+god+hakim#PPA921,M1 |author1=M. Th. Houtsma |author2=EJ Brill |title=First Encyclopaedia of Islam |year=1913–36|isbn=978-9004097964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Hakim disappeared one night while out on his evening ride – presumably assassinated, perhaps at the behest of his formidable elder sister [[Sitt al-Mulk]]. The Druze believe he went into [[Occultation (Islam)|Occultation]] with Hamza ibn Ali and three other prominent preachers, leaving the care of the "Unitarian missionary movement" to a new leader, [[Al-Muqtana Baha'uddin]] (also spelled Baha' ad-Din).

=== Closing of the faith ===
Al-Hakim was replaced by his underage son, [[Ali az-Zahir|'Alī az-Zahir]]. The Unitarian Druze movement, which existed in the [[Fatimid Caliphate]], acknowledged az-Zahir as the caliph, but followed Hamzah as its [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imam]].&lt;ref name=samy /&gt; The young caliph's regent, [[Sitt al-Mulk]], ordered the army to destroy the movement in 1021.&lt;ref name=about /&gt; At the same time, Bahā'a ad-Dīn as-Samuki was assigned the leadership of the Unitarian Movement by Hamza Bin Ali.&lt;ref name=samy /&gt;

For the next seven years, the Druze faced extreme persecution by the new caliph, al-Zahir, who wanted to eradicate the faith.&lt;ref name=Rebecca&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacredtribesjournal.org/images/Encyclopedia/The_Druze.pdf |title=The Druze |author=Rebecca Erickson |work=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518085757/http://www.sacredtribesjournal.org/images/Encyclopedia/The_Druze.pdf |archivedate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the result of a power struggle inside of the Fatimid empire in which the Druze were viewed with suspicion because of their refusal to recognize the new caliph, [[Ali az-Zahir]], as their Imam. Many spies, mainly the followers of Ad-Darazi, joined the Unitarian movement in order to infiltrate the Druze community. The spies set about agitating trouble and soiling the reputation of the Druze. This resulted in friction with the new caliph who clashed militarily with the Druze community. The clashes ranged from [[Antioch]] to [[Alexandria]], where tens of thousands of Druze were slaughtered by the Fatimid army.&lt;ref name=about /&gt; The largest massacre was at Antioch, where 5,000 Druze religious leaders were killed, followed by that of [[Aleppo]].&lt;ref name=about /&gt; As a result, the faith went underground in hope of survival, as those captured were either forced to renounce their faith or be killed. Druze survivors "were found principally in southern Lebanon and Syria." In 1038, two years after the death of al-Zahir, the Druze movement was able to resume because the new leadership that replaced him had friendly political ties with at least one prominent Druze leader.&lt;ref name=Rebecca /&gt;

=== During the Crusades ===
It was during the period of Crusader rule in Syria (1099–1291) that the Druze first emerged into the full light of history in the Gharb region of the [[Chouf]] Mountains. As powerful warriors serving the Muslim rulers of Damascus against the [[Crusades]], the Druze were given the task of keeping watch over the crusaders in the seaport of Beirut, with the aim of preventing them from making any encroachments inland. Subsequently, the Druze chiefs of the Gharb placed their considerable military experience at the disposal of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] rulers of Egypt (1250–1516); first, to assist them in putting an end to what remained of Crusader rule in coastal Syria, and later to help them safeguard the Syrian coast against Crusader retaliation by sea.&lt;ref name="Druze heritage"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.druzeheritage.org/dhf/Druze_History.asp |publisher=Druze Heritage |title=History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201657/http://www.druzeheritage.org/dhf/Druze_History.asp |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early period of the [[Crusades|Crusader]] era, the Druze feudal power was in the hands of two families, the [[Tanukh]]s and the [[Talal Arslan|Arslans]]. From their fortresses in the Gharb area (now in [[Aley District]]) of southern [[Mount Lebanon Governorate]], the Tanukhs led their incursions into the Phoenician coast and finally succeeded in holding Beirut and the marine plain against the [[Franks]]. Because of their fierce battles with the [[Crusaders]], the Druzes earned the respect of the [[Sunni]] Muslim caliphs and thus gained important political powers. After the middle of the twelfth century, the [[Maan family|Ma'an]] family superseded the [[Tanukhids|Tanukhs]] in Druze leadership. The origin of the family goes back to a Prince Ma'an who made his appearance in the Lebanon in the days of the 'Abbasid caliph [[al-Mustarshid]] (1118–35 AD). The Ma'ans chose for their abode the [[Chouf]] District in south-western Lebanon (southern [[Mount Lebanon Governorate]]), overlooking the maritime plain between [[Beirut]] and [[Sidon]], and made their headquarters in [[Baaqlin]], which is still a leading Druze village. They were invested with feudal authority by Sultan [[Nur ad-Din, atabeg of Aleppo|Nur ad-Din]] and furnished respectable contingents to the Muslim ranks in their struggle against the Crusaders.{{Sfn|Hitti|1924}}{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

=== Persecution during the Mamluk and Ottoman period ===
Having cleared Syria of the Franks, the [[Mamluk]] sultans of Egypt turned their attention to the schismatic Muslims of Syria. In 1305, after the issuing of a [[fatwa]] by the scholar [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] calling for [[jihad]] against all non-[[Sunni]] Muslims like the Druze, [[Alawites]], [[Ismaili]], and [[Twelver]] [[Shia]] Muslims, [[Al-Nasir Muhammad|al-Malik al-Nasir]] inflicted a disastrous defeat on the Druze at [[Keserwan District|Keserwan]] and forced outward compliance on their part to orthodox Sunni Islam. Later, under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], they were severely attacked at [[Saoufar]] in 1585 after the Ottomans claimed that they assaulted their caravans near [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]].{{Sfn | Hitti | 1924}}{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}} As a result of the Ottoman experience with the rebellious Druze, the word ''Durzi'' in Turkish came, and continues, to mean someone who is the ultimate thug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stefan Winter|title=The Shiites of Lebanon under Ottoman Rule, 1516–1788|date=11 Mar 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-48681-1|page=37}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One influential Islamic [[Sage (philosophy)|sage]] of that time{{who|date=October 2017}} labeled them as ''infidels'' and argued that, even though they might behave like Muslims on the outside, this is no more than a pretense.

Consequently, the 16th and 17th centuries were to witness a succession of armed Druze rebellions against the Ottomans, countered by repeated Ottoman punitive expeditions against the Chouf, in which the Druze population of the area was severely depleted and many villages destroyed. These military measures, severe as they were, did not succeed in reducing the local Druze to the required degree of subordination. This led the Ottoman government to agree to an arrangement whereby the different [[nahiyes]] (districts) of the [[Chouf]] would be granted in ''[[iltizam]]'' ("fiscal concession") to one of the region's [[amir]]s, or leading chiefs, leaving the maintenance of law and order and the collection of its taxes in the area in the hands of the appointed amir. This arrangement was to provide the cornerstone for the privileged status which ultimately came to be enjoyed by the whole of Mount Lebanon, Druze and Christian areas alike.&lt;ref name="Druze heritage" /&gt;

=== Ma'an dynasty ===
{{Main|Maan family}}
[[File:fakhreddincastle.jpg|right|frame|[[Palmyra Castle|Fakhreddin Castle]] in [[Palmyra]]]]
With the advent of the Ottoman Turks and the conquest of Syria by [[Selim I|Sultan Selim I]] in 1516, the [[Ma'ans]] were acknowledged by the new rulers as the feudal lords of southern Lebanon. Druze villages spread and prospered in that region, which under Ma'an leadership so flourished that it acquired the generic term of ''Jabal Bayt-Ma'an'' (the mountain home of the Ma'an) or ''Jabal al-Druze''. The latter title has since been usurped by the [[Hawran]] region, which since the middle of the 19th century has proven a haven of refuge to Druze emigrants from Lebanon and has become the headquarters of Druze power.{{Sfn|Hitti|1924}}{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

Under [[Fakhr-al-Din II|Fakhr-al-Dīn II]] (Fakhreddin II), the Druze dominion increased until it included Lebanon-Phoenicia and almost all Syria, extending from the edge of the Antioch plain in the north to [[Safad]] in the south, with a part of the Syrian desert dominated by [[Fakhr-al-Din al-Maani Castle|Fakhr-al-Din's castle]] at Tadmur ([[Palmyra]]), the ancient capital of [[Zenobia]]. The ruins of this castle still stand on a steep hill overlooking the town. Fakhr-al-Din became too strong for his Turkish sovereign in [[Constantinople]]. He went so far in 1608 as to sign a commercial treaty with [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Duke Ferdinand I of Tuscany]] containing secret military clauses. The Sultan then sent a force against him, and he was compelled to flee the land and seek refuge in the courts of [[Tuscany]] and [[Naples]] in 1613 and 1615 respectively.

In 1618 political changes in the Ottoman sultanate had resulted in the removal of many enemies of Fakhr-al-Din from power, signaling the prince's triumphant return to Lebanon soon afterwards. Through a clever policy of bribery and warfare, he extended his domains to cover all of modern Lebanon, some of Syria and northern Galilee.

In 1632 Küçük Ahmet Pasha was named Lord of [[Damascus]]. Küçük Ahmet Pasha was a rival of Fakhr-al-Din and a friend of the sultan [[Murad IV]], who ordered the pasha and the sultanate's navy to attack Lebanon and depose Fakhr-al-Din.

This time the prince decided to remain in Lebanon and resist the offensive, but the death of his son Ali in [[Wadi al-Taym]] was the beginning of his defeat. He later took refuge in [[Jezzine]]'s grotto, closely followed by Küçük Ahmet Pasha who eventually caught up with him and his family.

Fakhr-al-Din was captured, taken to [[Istanbul]], and imprisoned with two of his sons in the infamous Yedi Kule prison.  The Sultan had Fakhr-al-Din and his sons killed on 13 April 1635 in [[Istanbul]], bringing an end to an era in the history of Lebanon, which would not regain its current boundaries until it was proclaimed a mandate state and republic in 1920. One version recounts that the younger son was spared, raised in the harem and went on to become Ottoman Ambassador to India.&lt;ref&gt;TJ Gorton, [http://tjgorton.wordpress.com/prince-of-lebanon-a-druze-emir-at-the-court-of-the-medici/ ''Renaissance Emir: a Druze Warlord at the court of the Medici''] (London: Quartet Books, 2013), pp 167–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fakhr-al-Din II was the first ruler in modern Lebanon to open the doors of his country to foreign Western influences. Under his auspices the French established a khān (hostel) in Sidon, the [[Florence|Florentines]] a consulate, and Christian missionaries were admitted into the country. Beirut and Sidon, which Fakhr-al-Din II beautified, still bear traces of his benign rule. See the new biography of this Prince, based on original sources, by TJ Gorton: ''Renaissance Emir: a Druze Warlord at the Court of the Medici'' (London, Quartet Books, 2013), for an updated view of his life.

Fakhr ad Din II was succeeded in 1635 by his nephew Ahmed [[Mulhim Ma'n|Ma'an]], who ruled through his death in 1658. (Fakhr ad Din's only surviving son, Husayn, lived the rest of his life as a court official in Constantinople.) Emir Mulhim exercised [[Iltizam]] taxation rights in the Shuf, Gharb, Jurd, Matn, and Kisrawan districts of Lebanon. Mulhim's forces battled and defeated those of Mustafa Pasha, [[Beylerbey]] of Damascus, in 1642, but he is reported by historians to have been otherwise loyal to Ottoman rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-1-86064-856-4 |last=Abu-Husayn |first=Abdul-Rahim |title=The View from Istanbul: Lebanon and the Druze Emirate in the Ottoman Chancery Documents, 1546–1711 |year=2004 |pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Mulhim's death, his sons Ahmad and Korkmaz entered into a [[Druze power struggle (1658–1667)|power struggle]] with other Ottoman-backed Druze leaders. In 1660, the Ottoman Empire moved to reorganize the region, placing the [[sanjak]]s (districts) of Sidon-Beirut and Safed in a newly formed [[Sidon Province, Ottoman Empire|province of Sidon]], a move seen by local Druze as an attempt to assert control.&lt;ref name=VI22 /&gt; Contemporary historian Istifan al-Duwayhi reports that Korkmaz was killed in act of treachery by the Beylerbey of Damascus in 1662.&lt;ref name=VI22&gt;{{cite book |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-1-86064-856-4 |last=Abu-Husayn |first=Abdul-Rahim |title=The View from Istanbul: Lebanon and the Druze Emirate in the Ottoman Chancery Documents, 1546–1711 |year=2004 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad however emerged victorious in the [[Druze power struggle (1658–1667)|power struggle]] among the Druze in 1667, but the Maʿnīs lost control of Safad&lt;ref name="VI22-23" /&gt; and retreated to controlling the iltizam of the Shuf mountains and Kisrawan.&lt;ref name=Salibi&gt;{{cite book |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-1-86064-912-7 |last=Salibi |first=Kamal S. |title=A house of many mansions: the history of Lebanon reconsidered |year=2005 |page=66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad continued as local ruler through his death from natural causes, without heir, in 1697.&lt;ref name="VI22-23"&gt;{{cite book |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-1-86064-856-4 |last=Abu-Husayn |first=Abdul-Rahim |title=The view from Istanbul: Lebanon and the Druze Emirate in the Ottoman chancery documents, 1546–1711 |year=2004 |pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Ottoman–Habsburg War (1683–1699)]], Ahmad Ma'n collaborated in a rebellion against the Ottomans which extended beyond his death.&lt;ref name="VI22-23" /&gt; Iltizam rights in Shuf and Kisrawan passed to the rising [[Shihab family]] through female-line inheritance.&lt;ref name=Salibi /&gt;

=== Shihab Dynasty ===
{{Main|Shihab family}}
[[File:Druzewomantantur.jpg|thumb|right|Druze woman wearing a [[tantour]] during the 1870s in [[Chouf]], [[Ottoman Lebanon]]]]
As early as the days of [[Saladin]], and while the Ma'ans were still in complete control over southern Lebanon, the Shihab tribe, originally [[Hijaz]] Arabs but later settled in Ḥawran, advanced from Ḥawran, in 1172, and settled in [[Wadi al-Taym]] at the foot of mount [[Hermon]]. They soon made an alliance with the Ma'ans and were acknowledged as the Druze chiefs in ''Wadi al-Taym''. At the end of the 17th century (1697) the Shihabs succeeded the Ma'ans in the feudal leadership of Druze southern Lebanon, although they reportedly professed Sunni Islam, they showed sympathy with Druzism, the religion of the majority of their subjects.

The Shihab leadership continued until the middle of the 19th century and culminated in the illustrious governorship of [[Bashir Shihab II|Amir Bashir Shihab II]] (1788–1840) who, after Fakhr-al-Din, was the most powerful feudal lord Lebanon produced. Though governor of the Druze Mountain, Bashir was a [[crypto-Christian]], and it was he whose aid [[Napoleon]] solicited in 1799 during his campaign against Syria.

Having consolidated his conquests in Syria (1831–1838), [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], son of the viceroy of Egypt, [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]], made the fatal mistake of trying to disarm the Christians and Druzes of the Lebanon and to draft the latter into his army. This was contrary to the principles of the life of independence which these mountaineers had always lived, and resulted in a general uprising against Egyptian rule. The uprising was encouraged, for political reasons, by the British. The Druzes of Wadi al-Taym and Ḥawran, under the leadership of Shibli al-Aryan, distinguished themselves in their stubborn resistance at their inaccessible headquarters, ''al-Laja'', lying southeast of Damascus.{{Sfn | Hitti | 1924}}{{Rp| needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

=== Qaysites and the Yemenites ===
{{Main|Battle of Ain Darra}}
[[File:DruzeOttomanHakim.jpg|thumb|left|Meeting of Druze and Ottoman leaders in [[Damascus]], about the control of Jebel Druze]]
The conquest of Syria by the Muslim Arabs in the middle of the seventh century introduced into the land two political factions later called the Qaysites and the [[Yemen]]ites. The Qaysite party represented the [[Bedouin]] Arabs who were regarded as inferior by the Yemenites who were earlier and more cultured emigrants into Syria from southern Arabia. Druzes and Christians grouped in political rather than religious parties so the party lines in Lebanon obliterated racial and religious lines and the people grouped themselves regardless of their religious affiliations, into one or the other of these two parties. The sanguinary feuds between these two factions depleted, in course of time, the manhood of the Lebanon and ended in the decisive [[battle of Ain Dara]] in 1711, which resulted in the utter defeat of the Yemenite party. Many Yemenite Druzes thereupon immigrated to the [[Hawran]] region and thus laid the foundation of Druze power there.{{Sfn|Hitti|1924}}{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

=== Civil War of 1860===
{{Main|1860 Lebanon conflict}}
The Druzites and their Christian [[Maronite Christians in Lebanon|Maronite]] neighbors, who had thus far lived as religious communities on friendly terms, entered a period of social disturbance in 1840, which culminated in the [[1860 Lebanon conflict|civil war of 1860]].{{Sfn | Hitti | 1924}}{{Rp| needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

After the [[Shehab dynasty]] converted to Christianity, the Druze community and feudal leaders came under attack from the regime with the collaboration of the Catholic Church, and the Druze lost most of their political and feudal powers. Also, the Druze formed an alliance with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and allowed Protestant missionaries to enter Mount Lebanon, creating tension between them and the Catholic Maronites.

The Maronite-Druze conflict in 1840–60 was an outgrowth of the Maronite Christian independence movement,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} directed against the Druze, Druze feudalism, and the Ottoman-Turks. The civil war was not therefore a religious war,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} except in Damascus, where it spread and where the vastly non-Druze population was anti-Christian.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The movement culminated with the 1859–60 massacre and defeat of the Christians by the Druzes. The civil war of 1860 cost the Christians some ten thousand lives in [[Damascus]], [[Zahlé]], [[Deir al-Qamar]], [[Hasbaya]], and other towns of Lebanon.

The European powers then determined to intervene, and authorized the landing in Beirut of a body of French troops under [[Charles-Marie-Napoléon de Beaufort d'Hautpoul|General Beaufort d'Hautpoul]], whose inscription can still be seen on the historic rock at the mouth of [[Nahr al-Kalb]]. French intervention on behalf of the Maronites did not help the Maronite national movement, since France was restricted in 1860 by Britain, which did not want the [[Ottoman Empire]] dismembered. But European intervention pressured the Turks to treat the Maronites more justly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1977.tb03313.x |last1=Abraham |first1=Antoine |year=1977 |title=Lebanese Communal Relations |journal=Muslim World |volume=67 |issue=2|pages=91–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the recommendations of the powers, the Ottoman Porte granted Lebanon local autonomy, guaranteed by the powers, under a Christian governor.

=== Rebellion in Hauran ===
{{Main|Hauran Druze Rebellion}}
The Hauran rebellion was a violent Druze uprising against Ottoman authority in the Syrian province, which erupted in May 1909. The rebellion was led by [[al-Atrash]] family, originated in local disputes and Druze unwillingness to pay taxes and conscript into the Ottoman Army. The rebellion ended in brutal suppression of the Druze by General Sami Pasha al-Farouqi, significant depopulation of the Hauran region and execution of the Druze leaders in 1910. In the outcome of the revolt, 2,000 Druze were killed, a similar number wounded and hundreds of Druze fighters imprisoned. Al-Farouqi also disarmed the population, extracted significant taxes and launched a census of the region.

Despite their practice of blending with dominant groups to avoid persecution, and because the Druze religion does not endorse separatist sentiments but urges blending with the communities they reside in, the Druze have had a history of resistance to occupying powers, and they have at times enjoyed more freedom than most other groups living in the Levant.&lt;ref name=lexicorient /&gt;

In Syria, most Druzites live in the [[Jebel al-Druze]], a rugged and mountainous region in the southwest of the country, which is more than 90 percent Druze inhabited; some 120 villages are exclusively so.&lt;ref name=landis&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/L/Joshua.M.Landis-1/Joshua_Landis_Druze_and_Shishakli.htm |title=Shishakli and the Druzes: Integration and intransigence |first=Joshua |last=Landis |work=The Syrian Land: Processes of Integration and Fragmentation |location=Stuttgart |publisher=Franz Steiner Verlag |year=1998 |pages=369–96 |editor1-first=T |editor1-last=Philipp |editor2-first=B |editor2-last=Schäbler}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}} Other notable communities live in the [[Harim Mountains]], the Damascus suburb of [[Jaramana]], and on the southeast slopes of [[Mount Hermon]]. A large Syrian Druze community historically lived in the Golan Heights, but following wars with Israel in [[Six-Day War|1967]] and [[Yom Kippur War|1973]], many of these Druze fled to other parts of Syria; most of those who remained live in a handful of villages in the disputed zone, while only a few live in the narrow remnant of [[Quneitra Governorate]] that is still under effective Syrian control.

[[File:Druzeindependance1925.jpg|thumb|right|Druze celebrating their independence in 1925.]]
The Druze always played a far more important role in Syrian politics than its comparatively small population would suggest. With a community of little more than 100,000 in 1949, or roughly three percent of the Syrian population, the Druze of Syria's southwestern mountains constituted a potent force in Syrian politics and played a leading role in the nationalist struggle against the French. Under the military leadership of [[Sultan Pasha al-Atrash]], the Druze provided much of the military force behind the [[Great Syrian Revolt|Syrian Revolution]] of 1925–27. In 1945, Amir Hasan al-Atrash, the paramount political leader of the [[Jabal el Druze (state)|Jebel al-Druze]], led the Druze military units in a successful revolt against the French, making the Jebel al-Druze the first and only region in Syria to liberate itself from French rule without British assistance. At independence the Druze, made confident by their successes, expected that Damascus would reward them for their many sacrifices on the battlefield. They demanded to keep their autonomous administration and many political privileges accorded them by the French and sought generous economic assistance from the newly independent government.&lt;ref name=landis /&gt;{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

[[File:SyrianDouroze.jpg|thumb|left|Druze leaders meeting in [[Jebel al-Druze]], Syria, 1926]]
When a local paper in 1945 reported that President [[Shukri al-Quwatli]] (1943–49) had called the Druzes a "dangerous minority", Sultan Pasha al-Atrash flew into a rage and demanded a public retraction. If it were not forthcoming, he announced, the Druzes would indeed become "dangerous" and a force of 4,000 Druze warriors would "occupy the city of Damascus." Quwwatli could not dismiss Sultan Pasha's threat. The military balance of power in Syria was tilted in favor of the Druzes, at least until the military build up during the 1948 War in Palestine. One advisor to the Syrian Defense Department warned in 1946 that the Syrian army was "useless", and that the Druzes could "take Damascus and capture the present leaders in a breeze."&lt;ref name=landis /&gt;{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

During the four years of [[Adib Shishakli]]'s rule in Syria (December 1949 to February 1954) (on 25 August 1952: [[Adib al-Shishakli]] created the [[Arab Liberation Movement]] (ALM), a progressive party with [[pan-Arabist]] and socialist views),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.syrianhistory.com/node/3379 |title=Syrian History}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Druze community was subjected to a heavy attack by the Syrian government. Shishakli believed that among his many opponents in Syria, the Druzes were the most potentially dangerous, and he was determined to crush them. He frequently proclaimed: "My enemies are like a serpent: the head is the Jebel al-Druze, the stomach [[Homs]], and the tail Aleppo. If I crush the head the serpent will die." Shishakli dispatched 10,000 regular troops to occupy the Jebel al-Druze. Several towns were bombarded with heavy weapons, killing scores of civilians and destroying many houses. According to Druze accounts, Shishakli encouraged neighboring bedouin tribes to plunder the defenseless population and allowed his own troops to run amok.&lt;ref name = landis /&gt;{{Rp|needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

Shishakli launched a brutal campaign to defame the Druzes for their religion and politics. He accused the entire community of treason, at times claiming they were agents of the British and [[Hashemite|Hashimites]], at others that they were fighting for Israel against the Arabs. He even produced a cache of Israeli weapons allegedly discovered in the Jabal. Even more painful for the Druze community was his publication of "falsified Druze religious texts" and false testimonials ascribed to leading Druze sheikhs designed to stir up sectarian hatred. This propaganda also was broadcast in the Arab world, mainly Egypt. Shishakli was assassinated in Brazil on 27 September 1964 by a Druze seeking revenge for Shishakli's bombardment of the Jebel al-Druze.&lt;ref name=landis /&gt;{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

He forcibly integrated minorities into the national [[Syrian]] social structure, his "Syrianization" of [[Alawite]] and Druze territories had to be accomplished in part using violence, he declared: "My enemies are like serpent. The head is the [[Jabal Druze]], if I crush the head the serpent will die" (Seale 1963:132).&lt;ref name=landis /&gt; To this end, al-Shishakli encouraged the stigmatization of minorities. He saw minority demands as tantamount to treason. His increasingly chauvinistic notions of Arab nationalism were predicated on the denial that "minorities" existed in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecTTlytIjswC&amp;pg=PA41 |title=Syria's Kurds: History, Politics and Society |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780203892114 |date=2008-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

On July 25, 2018, a group of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]]-affiliated attackers entered the Druze city of [[As-Suwayda]] and initiated a [[2018 As-Suwayda attacks|series of gunfights and suicide bombings]] on its streets killing at least 258 people, the vast majority of them civilians.&lt;ref name="cbs"/&gt;

=== In Lebanon ===

[[File:Prophet Job Shrine.jpg|thumb|[[Job (Bible)|Prophet Job]] shrine in Lebanon the [[Chouf]] region]]
The Druzite community in Lebanon played an important role in the formation of the modern state of Lebanon, and even though they are a minority they play an important role in the Lebanese political scene. Before and during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975–90), the Druze were in favor of [[Pan-Arabism]] and Palestinian resistance represented by the [[PLO]]. Most of the community supported the [[Progressive Socialist Party]] formed by their leader [[Kamal Jumblatt]] and they fought alongside other leftist and Palestinian parties against the [[Lebanese Front]] that was mainly constituted of Christians. After the assassination of Kamal Jumblatt on 16 March 1977, his son [[Walid Jumblatt]] took the leadership of the party and played an important role in preserving his father's legacy after winning the [[Mountain War]] and sustained the existence of the Druze community during the sectarian bloodshed that lasted until 1990.

In August 2001, [[Maronite Christians in Lebanon|Maronite Catholic]] [[Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir|Patriarch Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir]] toured the predominantly Druze Chouf region of Mount Lebanon and visited [[Mukhtara]], the ancestral stronghold of Druze leader Walid Jumblatt. The tumultuous reception that Sfeir received not only signified a historic reconciliation between Maronites and Druze, who fought a bloody war in 1983–84, but underscored the fact that the banner of Lebanese sovereignty had broad multi-confessional appeal&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publisher=Meib |url=http://www.meib.org/articles/0305_ld.htm |format=dossier |title=Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir |date=May 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030611090352/http://meib.org/articles/0305_ld.htm |archivedate=11 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a cornerstone for the [[Cedar Revolution]] in 2005. Jumblatt's post-2005 position diverged sharply from the tradition of his family. He also accused Damascus of being behind the 1977 assassination of his father, Kamal Jumblatt, expressing for the first time what many knew he privately suspected.

In 1957, the Israeli government designated the Druze a distinct ethnic community at the request of its communal leaders.

{{Main|Druze in Jordan}}

The Druzites form a religious minority in [[Jordan]] of around 32,000, mostly residing in the northwestern part of the country.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== Beliefs ==
=== God ===
The Druze conception of the deity is declared by them to be one of strict and uncompromising unity. The main Druze doctrine states that [[God]] is both [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and [[Immanence|immanent]], in which he is above all attributes but at the same time he is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Druze Faith |first=[[Sami Makarem|Sami Nasib]] |last=[[Sami Makarem|Makarem]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their desire to maintain a rigid confession of unity, they stripped from God all attributes (''[[Tanzih|tanzīh]]''). In God, there are no attributes distinct from his essence. He is wise, mighty, and just, not by wisdom, might and justice, but by his own essence. God is "the whole of existence", rather than "above existence" or on his throne, which would make him "limited". There is neither "how", "when", nor "where" about him; he is incomprehensible.&lt;ref name=swayd&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.eial.org/mesp/Swayd.rtf.rtf |title=Druze Spirituality and Asceticism |first=Dr. Samy |last=Swayd, SDSU |format=an abridged rough draft; [[Rich Text Format|RTF]] |publisher=Eial |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005012522/http://www.eial.org/mesp/Swayd.rtf.rtf |archivedate=5 October 2006 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

In this dogma, they are similar to the semi-philosophical, semi-religious body which flourished under [[Al-Ma'mun]] and was known by the name of [[Mu'tazila]] and the fraternal order of the [[Brethren of Purity]] (''Ikhwan al-Ṣafa'').{{Sfn|Hitti|1924}}{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

Unlike the ''Mu'tazila'', however, and similar to some branches of [[Sufism]], the Druze believe in the concept of ''Tajalli'' (meaning "[[theophany]]").&lt;ref name=swayd /&gt;{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}} ''Tajalli'' is often misunderstood by scholars and writers and is usually confused with the concept of [[incarnation]].

{{quote|[Incarnation] is the core spiritual beliefs in the Druze and some other intellectual and spiritual traditions&amp;nbsp;... In a mystical sense, it refers to the light of God experienced by certain mystics who have reached a high level of purity in their spiritual journey. Thus, God is perceived as the [[Lahut]] [the divine] who manifests His Light in the Station ([[Maqaam]]) of the [[Nasut]] [material realm] without the Nasut becoming Lahut. This is like one's image in the mirror: one is in the mirror but does not become the mirror. The Druze manuscripts are emphatic and warn against the belief that the Nasut is God&amp;nbsp;... Neglecting this warning, individual seekers, scholars, and other spectators have considered al-Hakim and other figures divine.

&amp;nbsp;... In the Druze scriptural view, Tajalli takes a central stage. One author comments that Tajalli occurs when the seeker's humanity is annihilated so that divine attributes and light are experienced by the person.&lt;ref name=swayd /&gt;{{Rp| needed=yes|date=April 2012}}}}

=== Scriptures ===
Druze Sacred texts include the [[Kitab Al Hikma]] (Epistles of Wisdom).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.druze.org.au/religion/ |title=Religion |publisher=Druze |place=AU |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214100847/http://www.druze.org.au/religion/ |archivedate=14 February 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other ancient Druze writings include the ''Rasa'il al-Hind (Epistles of India)'' and the previously lost (or hidden) manuscripts such as ''al-Munfarid bi-Dhatihi'' and ''al-Sharia al-Ruhaniyya'' as well as others including [[didactic]] and [[polemic]] [[treatises]].&lt;ref name="Incorporated1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Grolier Incorporated|title=The Encyclopedia Americana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lm0NAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=17 March 2011|year=1996|publisher=Grolier Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reincarnation ===
{{See also|Reincarnation#Druze}}
Reincarnation is a paramount principle in the Druze faith.&lt;ref&gt;Seabrook, W. B., ''Adventures in Arabia'', Harrap and Sons 1928, (chapters on Druze religion)&lt;/ref&gt; Reincarnations occur instantly at one's death because there is an eternal [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|duality]] of the body and the soul and it is impossible for the soul to exist without the body. A human soul will transfer only to a human body, in contrast to the Hindu and Buddhist belief systems, according to which souls can transfer to any living creature. Furthermore, a male Druze can be reincarnated only as another male Druze and a female Druze only as another female Druze. A Druze cannot be reincarnated in the body of a non-Druze. Additionally, souls cannot be divided and the number of souls existing in the universe is finite.&lt;ref&gt;Dwairy, Marwan (2006) "The Psychosocial Function Of Reincarnation Among Druze In Israel" ''Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry'', page 29–53&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle of rebirth is continuous and the only way to escape is through successive reincarnations. When this occurs, the soul is united with the Cosmic Mind and achieves the ultimate happiness.&lt;ref name="Druze" /&gt;

=== Pact of Time Custodian ===
The Pact of Time Custodian (''{{transl|ar|Mithaq Walley El-Zaman}}'') is considered the entrance to the Druze religion, and they believe that all Druze in their past lives have signed this Charter, and Druze believe that this Charter embodies with human souls after death.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I rely on our Moula Al-Hakim the lonely God, the individual, the eternal, who is out of couples and numbers, (someone) the son of (someone) has approved recognition enjoined on himself and on his soul, in a healthy of his mind and his body, permissibility aversive is obedient and not forced, to repudiate from all creeds, articles and all religions and beliefs on the differences varieties, and he does not know something except obedience of almighty Moulana Al-Hakim, and obedience is worship and that it does not engage in worship anyone ever attended or wait, and that he had handed his soul and his body and his money and all he owns to almighty Maulana Al-Hakim.&lt;ref name="epistles of wisdom"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ḥamza ibn ʻAli ibn Aḥmad and Baha'a El-Din |title=The Druze holy book Epistles of Wisdom – page.47 "Elmithaq" |url=http://www.christoph-heger.de/epistles_wisdom_1.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2011|publisher=[[Christoph Heger]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Druze also use a similar formula, called al-'ahd, when one is initiated into the ʻUqqāl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hanna Batatu|title=Syria's Peasantry, the Descendants of Its Lesser Rural Notables, and Their Politics|date=17 Sep 2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-4584-2|pages=15–16|quote=I&amp;nbsp;... son of&amp;nbsp;... being sane of spirit and body and duly qualified, attest on my soul, without compulsion or constraint, that I renounce all the different cults, religions, and creeds and acknowledge nothing other than obedience to our Lord al-Hakim, revered be his name, and obedience is worship; that in his worship I associate no past, present, or future being; that I commit my soul, my body, my property, and my offspring&amp;nbsp;... to our Lord al-Hakim&amp;nbsp;... and accept all his decrees, be they in my favour or against me&amp;nbsp;...

Hamzah bin 'Ali bin Ahmad, the guide of those who respond [to the divine call] and the avenger on the polytheists with the sword of our Lord.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 January 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sanctuaries ===
The prayer-houses of the Druze are called ''khalwa'' or ''khalwat''. The primary [[sanctuary]] of the Druze is at [[Khalwat al-Bayada]].&lt;ref name="Dānā2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nissîm Dānā|title=The Druze in the Middle East: Their Faith, Leadership, Identity and Status|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2nCWIsyZJxUC&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=11 September 2012|year=2003|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-903900-36-9|pages=38–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Esotericism ===
The Druze believe that many teachings given by prophets, religious leaders and holy books have esoteric meanings preserved for those of intellect, in which some teachings are [[Religious symbolism|symbolic]] and [[allegory|allegorical]] in nature, and divide the understanding of holy books and teachings into three layers.

These layers, according to the Druze, are as follows:
* The obvious or [[exoteric]] ''([[Zahir (Islam)|zahir]])'', accessible to anyone who can read or hear;
* The hidden or [[esoteric]] ''([[Batin (Islam)|batin]])'', accessible to those who are willing to search and learn through the concept of [[exegesis]];
* And the hidden of the hidden, a concept known as ''[[anagoge]]'', inaccessible to all but a few really enlightened individuals who truly understand the nature of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3694809 |contribution=The Druze|title=h2g2 |publisher=BBC |place=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Druze do not believe that the esoteric meaning abrogates or necessarily abolishes the exoteric one. Hamza bin Ali refutes such claims by stating that if the esoteric interpretation of ''[[taharah]]'' (purity) is purity of the heart and soul, it doesn't mean that a person can discard his physical purity, as ''[[salat]]'' (prayer) is useless if a person is untruthful in his speech and that the esoteric and exoteric meanings complement each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |contribution=The Epistle Answering the People of Esotericism ''(batinids)'' |title=Epistles of Wisdom |volume=Second }} (a rough translation from the Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seven Druze precepts ===
{{further|Seven pillars of Ismailism#Druze list}}
The Druze follow seven moral precepts or duties that are considered the core of the faith.&lt;ref name="Druze" /&gt;
The Seven Druze precepts are:{{Sfn|Hitti|1924|p=51}}
# Veracity in speech and the truthfulness of the tongue.
# Protection and mutual aid to the brethren in faith.
# Renunciation of all forms of former worship (specifically, invalid creeds) and false belief.
# Repudiation of the devil ([[Iblis]]), and all forces of evil (translated from Arabic ''Toghyan'', meaning "[[despotism]]").
# Confession of God's unity.
# Acquiescence in God's acts no matter what they be.
# Absolute submission and resignation to God's divine will in both secret and public.

=== Taqiyya ===
Complicating their identity is the custom of ''{{transl|ar|[[taqiyya]]}}''—concealing or disguising their beliefs when necessary—that they adopted from Ismailism and the esoteric nature of the faith, in which many teachings are kept secretive. This is done in order to keep the religion from those who are not yet prepared to accept the teachings and therefore could misunderstand it, as well as to protect the community when it is in danger. Druzes tend to follow the dominant religion of the country where they reside. Some claim to be Muslim or Christian in order to avoid persecution; some do not.&lt;ref name="kais"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of the Druzes, Volume 1|last=Firro|first=Kais|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-09437-6|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Druze in different states can have radically different lifestyles.{{Sfn|Dana|2003|p=18}}

=== Other beliefs ===
The Druze allow divorce, although it is discouraged; circumcision is not necessary; they cannot be reborn as non-Druze; those who purify and perfect their soul ascend to the stars upon death; when al-Hakim returns, all faithful Druze will join him in his march from China and on to conquer the world;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gananath Obeyesekere|title=Karma and Rebirth: A Cross Cultural Study|date=2006|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] Publishe|isbn=9788120826090|pages=311, 313–14|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; apostasy is forbidden,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Farhad Daftary|title=The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines|date=20 Sep 2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-46578-6|page=189|edition=2, illustrated, revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually have religious services on Thursday evenings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Samy S.

== Religious symbol {{anchor|Druze flag|flag|Druze star}} ==
[[File:Druze star.svg|70px|frameless|right]]
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
The Druze strictly avoid [[iconography]] but use five colors ("Five Limits" {{lang|ar|خمس حدود}} ''{{transl|ar|khams ḥudūd}}'') as a religious symbol:{{year needed|date=July 2017}} green, red, yellow, blue, and white. Each color pertains to a metaphysical power called ''{{transl|ar|ḥadd}}'', literally 'a limit', as in the distinctions that separate humans from animals, or the powers that make human the animalistic body. Each ''{{transl|ar|ḥadd}}'' is color-coded in the following manner:
* Green for ''{{transl|ar|ʻAql}}'' "the Universal Mind/Intelligence/[[Nous]]",
* Red for ''{{transl|ar|Nafs}}'' "the Universal Soul/[[Anima mundi]]",
* Yellow for ''{{transl|ar|Kalima}}'' "the Word/[[Logos]]",
* Blue for ''{{transl|ar|Sabiq}}'' "the Potentiality/Cause/Precedent", and
* White for ''{{transl|ar|Tali}}'' "the Future/Effect/[[Immanence]]".

The mind generates [[qualia]] and gives consciousness. The soul embodies the mind and is responsible for transmigration and the character of oneself. The word which is the atom of language communicates qualia between humans and represents the platonic forms in the sensible world. The ''{{transl|ar|Sabq}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|Tali}}'' is the ability to perceive and learn from the past and plan for the future and predict it.

[[File:Flag of Druze.svg|70px|frameless|right]]
The colors can be arranged in vertically descending stripes (as a flag) or a [[five-pointed star]]. The stripes are a diagrammatic cut of the spheres in neoplatonic philosophy, while the five-pointed star embodies the [[golden ratio]], [[phi]], as a symbol of [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] and a life of moderation.

== Prayer houses and holy places ==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 6935 In the holy place of jethro.jpg|thumb|Jethro shrine and temple of Druze in [[Hittin]], northern [[Israel]]]]
Holy places of the Druze are archaeological sites important to the community and associated with religious holidays&lt;ref name=dhp&gt;{{cite web|title=Holy places of the Druze |url=http://www.al-amama.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=848|publisher=Aamama|issue=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; – the most notable example being [[Nabi Shu'ayb]], dedicated to [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]], who is a central figure of the Druze religion. Druze make pilgrimages to this site on the holiday of [[Ziyarat al-Nabi Shu'ayb]].

[[File:DrusischerTempel.jpg|thumb|Druze Prayer house in [[Daliyat al-Karmel|Daliat al-Karmel]], [[Israel]]]]
One of the most important features of the Druze village having a central role in social life is the ''{{transl|ar|[[Khalwat al-Bayada|khalwat]]}}''—a house of prayer, retreat and religious unity. The ''{{transl|ar|khalwat}}'' may be known as ''{{transl|ar|[[majlis]]}}'' in local languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Khalwah the prayer place of the Druze |url=http://www.druzesect.com/?p=184|publisher=Druze sect site|date=2010-08-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203003230/http://www.druzesect.com/?p=184 |archivedate=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second type of religious shrine is one associated with the anniversary of a historic event or death of a prophet. If it is a [[mausoleum]] the Druze call it [[Mazar (mausoleum)|''mazār'']] and if it is a [[shrine]] they call it [[Maqam (shrine)|''maqām'']]. The holy places become more important to the community in times of adversity and calamity. The holy places and [[shrine]]s of the Druze are scattered in various villages, in places where they are protected and cared for. They are found in [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=dhp /&gt;

== Initiates and "ignorant" members ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
[[File:Druze man.jpg|thumb|Druze [[sheikh]] (''{{transl|ar|ʻuqqāl}}'') wearing religious dress]]

The Druzes do not recognize any religious hierarchy. As such, there is no "Druze clergy". Those few initiated in the Druze holy books are called '''ʿuqqāl''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Druze|title=Druze - History, Religion, &amp; Facts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the "ignorant", regular members of the group are called '''juhhāl'''.

{{anchor|al-Juhhāl|Juhhāl|Juhhal|Juhhaal}}
Given the strict religious, intellectual and spiritual requirements, most of the Druzes are not initiated and might be referred to as ''{{transl|ar|al-Juhhāl}}'' ({{lang|ar|جهال}}), literally "the Ignorant", but in practice referring to the non-initiated Druzes; however, that term is seldom used by the Druzes. Those are not granted access to the Druze holy literature or allowed to attend the initiated religious meetings of the ''{{transl|ar|ʻuqqāl}}''. The cohesiveness and frequent inter-community social interaction however makes it in sort that that most Druzes have an idea about their broad ethical requirements and have some sense of what their theology consists of (albeit often flawed).

{{anchor|al-ʻUqqāl|ʻuqqāl|Uqqal|Uqqaal}}
The initiated religious group, which includes both men and women (less than 10% of the population), is called ''{{transl|ar|al-ʻUqqāl}}'' ({{lang|ar|عقال}} "the Knowledgeable Initiates"). They might or might not dress differently, although most wear a costume that was characteristic of mountain people in previous centuries. Women can opt to wear ''{{transl|ar|al-mandīl}}'', a loose white [[veil]], especially in the presence of other people. They wear ''{{transl|ar|al-mandīl}}'' on their heads to cover their hair and wrap it around their mouths. They wear black shirts and long skirts covering their legs to their ankles. Male ''{{transl|ar|ʻuqqāl}}'' often grow mustaches, and wear dark Levantine-Turkish traditional dresses, called the ''{{transl|ar|shirwal}}'', with white turbans that vary according to the seniority of the ''{{transl|ar|ʻuqqāl}}''. Traditionally the Druze women have played an important role both socially and religiously inside the community.

''{{transl|ar|Al-ʻuqqāl}}'' have equal rights to ''{{transl|ar|al-Juhhāl}}'', but establish a hierarchy of respect based on religious service. The most influential of ''{{transl|ar|al-ʻuqqāl}}'' become ''{{transl|ar|Ajawīd}}'', recognized religious leaders, and from this group the spiritual leaders of the Druze are assigned. While the ''{{transl|ar|[[Shaykh]] al-ʻAql}}'', which is an official position in Syria, Lebanon, and Israel, is elected by the local community and serves as the head of the Druze religious council, judges from the Druze religious courts are usually elected for this position. Unlike the spiritual leaders, the authority of the ''{{transl|ar|Shaykh al-ʻAql}}'' is limited to the country he is elected in, though in some instances spiritual leaders are elected to this position.

The Druze believe in the unity of God, and are often known as the "People of Monotheism" or simply "Monotheists". Their [[theology]] has a [[Neo-Platonism|Neo-Platonic]] view about how God interacts with the world through emanations and is similar to some [[gnosticism|gnostic]] and other [[esotericism|esoteric]] sects. Druze philosophy also shows [[Sufi]] influences.

Druze principles focus on honesty, loyalty, [[filial piety]], [[altruism]], patriotic sacrifice, and [[monotheism]]. They reject [[nicotine]], [[alcohol]], and other [[drug]]s, and often the consumption of pork (to those Uqqāl and not necessarily to be required by the Juhhāl). Druze reject [[polygamy]], believe in [[reincarnation]], and are not obliged to observe most of the religious rituals. The Druze believe that rituals are symbolic and have an individualistic effect on the person, for which reason Druze are free to perform them, or not. The community does celebrate [[Eid al-Adha]], however, considered their most significant holiday.

== Culture ==
=== Cuisine ===
[[Mate (beverage)|Matè]] is a popular drink consumed by the Druze brought to the Levant from Syrian migrants from [[Argentina]] in the 19th century. Mate is made by steeping dried leaves of [[yerba mate]] in hot water and is served with a metal straw (''bambija'' or ''masassa'') from a gourd (''finjan/Qar'aa''). Mate is often the first item served when entering a Druze home. It is a social drink and can be shared between multiple participants. After each drinker, the metal straw is cleaned with a lemon rind. Traditional snacks eaten with mate include raisins, nuts, dried figs, biscuits, and chips.&lt;ref name="donald"&gt;{{cite book|title=Medical Toxicology of Drug Abuse: Synthesized Chemicals and Psychoactive Plants|last=Barceloux |first=Donald |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-10605-1|date=2012-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Middle East Online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=64763|title=South American 'mate' tea a long-time Lebanese hit|publisher=Middle East Online|accessdate=11 March 2014|date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
=== Ethnic origins ===
{{disputed section|date=May 2014}}

==== Arabian hypothesis ====
The Druze faith extended to many areas in the Middle East, but most of the modern Druze can trace their origin to the ''[[Wadi al-Taym]]'' in [[South Lebanon]], which is named after an Arab tribe ''Taymour-Allah (formerly Taymour-Allat) '' which, according to Islamic historian, [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], first came from Arabia into the valley of the [[Euphrates]] where they had been Christianized prior to their migration into the Lebanon. Many of the Druze feudal families whose genealogies have been preserved by the two modern Syrian chroniclers Haydar al-Shihabi and [[Ahmad Faris Shidyaq|al-Shidyaq]] seem also to point in the direction of this origin. Arabian tribes emigrated via the [[Persian Gulf]] and stopped in Iraq on the route that was later to lead them to Syria. The first feudal Druze family, the [[Tanukh]] family, which made for itself a name in fighting the Crusaders, was, according to Haydar al-Shihabi, an Arab tribe from [[Mesopotamia]] where it occupied the position of a ruling family and apparently was Christianized.{{Sfn|Hitti|1924}}{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

Travelers like [[Niebuhr]], and scholars like [[Max von Oppenheim]], undoubtedly echoing the popular Druze belief regarding their own origin, have classified them as Arabs. The prevailing idea among the [[Druzes]] themselves today is that they are of Arab stock.

==== Druze as a mixture of Middle Eastern tribes ====
The 1911 edition of [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] states that the Druzes are "a mixture of refugee stocks, in which the Arab largely predominates, grafted on to an original mountain population of Aramaic blood."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=605}}

The Tanukhs must have left [[Arabia]] as early as the second or third century AD. The [[Maan family|Ma'an]] tribe, which superseded the Tanukhs and produced the greatest Druze hero, [[Fakhreddin II|Fakhr-al-Din]], had the same traditional origin. The ''Talhuq'' family and '' 'Abd-al-Malik'', who supplied the later Druze leadership, have the same record as the Tanukhs. The [[Imad]] family is named for ''al-Imadiyyah''—the Kurdish town of [[Amadiya]], northeast of [[Mosul]] inside [[Kurdistan]], and, like the [[Jumblatt]]s, is thought to be of [[Kurds|Kurdish]] tribal origin, the Janpulad ("soul of steel") are still found east of [[Adana]] in Turkey, across the borders from Syria. The leading "Atrash" family also can trace its background to the Kurdish tribe, the Hartush/Atrush, found in northern Iraq and southeastern Turkey today. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The Arsalan family claims descent from the [[Hirah]] Arab kings, but the name ''Arsalan'' (Persian and Turkish for lion) suggests Persian influence, if not origin.{{Sfn |Hitti |1924}}{{Rp|needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

During the 18th century, there were two branches of Druze living in Lebanon: the Yemeni Druze, headed by the "Harmouche" and "Alamuddine" families; and the Kaysi Druze, headed by the [[Jumblatt family|Jumblatt]] and [[Arslan family|Arslan]] families. The Harmouche family was banished from [[Mount Lebanon]] following the [[battle of Ain Dara]] in 1711. The battle was fought between two Druze factions: the Yemeni and the Kaysi. Following their dramatic defeat, the Yemeni faction migrated to Syria in the [[Jebel-Druze]] region and its capital, [[As-Suwayda]]. However, it has been argued that these two factions were of political nature rather than ethnic, and had both Christian and Druze supporters.

==== Iturean hypothesis ====
According to Jewish contemporary literature, the Druze, who were visited and described in 1165 by [[Benjamin of Tudela]], were pictured as descendants of the [[Itureans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hitti|first=P. K. |title=The Origins of the Druze People and Religion: With Extracts from Their Sacred Writings|work=Library of Alexandria|year=1966 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pYgvLf2GE8YC&amp;pg=PT10&amp;dq=druze+benjamin+of+tudela#v=onepage&amp;q=druze%20benjamin%20of%20tudela&amp;f=false|isbn=9781465546623 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Ismaelite]] [[Arab]] tribe, which used to reside in the northern parts of the [[Golan Heights|Golan plateau]] through Hellenistic and Roman periods. The word Druzes, in an early Hebrew edition of his travels, occurs as "Dogziyin", but it is clear that this is a scribal error.

Archaeological assessments of the Druze region have also proposed the possibility of Druze descending from Itureans,&lt;ref&gt;Religious and Theological Abstracts. Vol 34–35. "Heretofore studies of the Ituraeans have been based on historical sources and written history. Archaeological surveys from 1968 to&amp;nbsp;...

=== Genetics ===
In a 2005 study of [[ASPM (gene)|ASPM gene variants]], Mekel-Bobrov et al. found that the [[Israelis|Israeli]] Druze people of the [[Mount Carmel]] region have among the highest rate of the newly evolved ASPM- Haplogroup D, at 52.2% occurrence of the approximately 6,000-year-old allele.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/309/5741/1720 |title=Ongoing Adaptive Evolution of ASPM, a Brain Size Determinant in Homo sapiens |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=9 September 2005 |volume=309 |number=5741 |pages=1720–22 |doi=10.1126/science.1116815 |pmid=16151010|bibcode=2005Sci...309.1720M |last1=Mekel-Bobrov |first1=N |last2=Gilbert |first2=SL |last3=Evans |first3=PD |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is not yet known exactly what selective advantage is provided by this gene variant, the Haplogroup D allele is thought to be positively selected in populations and to confer some substantial advantage that has caused its frequency to rapidly increase.

One small [[DNA]] study has shown that Israeli Druze are remarkable for the high frequency (35%) of males who carry the [[Y-chromosome|Y-chromosomal]] [[Haplogroup L (Y-DNA)|haplogroup L]] (though some [[Afshar, Syria|Afshar]] village{{dubious|word(s) missing, sense probably lost|date=December 2016}} and the [[Raqqa]] Syrians have even more), which is otherwise uncommon in the Mideast (Shen et al. 2004).&lt;ref name="Shen"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reconstruction of Patrilineages and Matrilineages of Samaritans and Other Israeli Populations From Y-Chromosome and Mitochondrial DNA Sequence Variation |author=Peidong Shen |display-authors=etal |journal=Human Mutation |date=2004 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=248–260 |isbn= |url=http://evolutsioon.ut.ee/publications/Shen2004.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2 December 2016 |doi=10.1002/humu.20077|pmid=15300852 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This haplogroup originates from prehistoric [[South Asia]] and has spread from [[Pakistan]] into southern [[Iran]]. However, studies done on larger samples showed that L-M20 averages 5% in Israeli Druze,&lt;ref group=Footnote&gt;12/222 Shlush et al. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 8% in Lebanese Druze,&lt;ref group=Footnote&gt;1/25 Shlush et al. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and it was not found in a sample of 59 Syrian Druze.

Cruciani in 2007 found E1b1b1a2 (E-V13) [a subclade of E1b1b1a (E-M78)] in high levels (&gt;10% of the male population) in Turkish Cypriot and Druze Arab lineages. Recent genetic clustering analyses of ethnic groups are consistent with the close ancestral relationship between the Druze and Cypriots, and also identified similarity to the general Syrian and Lebanese populations, as well as a variety of Jewish groups (Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Iraqi, and Moroccan) (Behar et al. 2010).&lt;ref name="Behar2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Doron M. Behar |author2=Bayazit Yunusbayev |author3=Mait Metspalu |author4=Ene Metspalu |author5=Saharon Rosset |author6=Jüri Parik |author7=Siiri Rootsi |author8=Gyaneshwer Chaubey |author9=Ildus Kutuev |author10=Guennady Yudkovsky |author11=Elza K.

Also, a new study concluded that the Druze harbor a remarkable diversity of [[human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup|mitochondrial DNA]] lineages that appear to have separated from each other thousands of years ago. But instead of dispersing throughout the world after their separation, the full range of lineages can still be found within the Druze population.&lt;ref name=dna&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080508182219.htm |date=12 May 2008|title=Genetics Confirm Oral Traditions of Druze In Israel |journal=ScienceDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers noted that the Druze villages contained a striking range of high frequency and high diversity of the [[Haplogroup X (mtDNA)|X haplogroup]], suggesting that this population provides a glimpse into the past genetic landscape of the [[Near East]] at a time when the X haplogroup was more prevalent.&lt;ref name=dna /&gt;

These findings are consistent with the Druze [[oral tradition]], that claims that the adherents of the faith came from diverse ancestral lineages stretching back tens of thousands of years.&lt;ref name=dna /&gt; The [[Shroud of Turin]] analysis shows significant traces of mitochondrial DNA unique to the Druze community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep14484|title=Uncovering the sources of DNA found on the Turin Shroud|first1=Gianni|last1=Barcaccia|first2=Giulio|last2=Galla|first3=Alessandro|last3=Achilli|first4=Anna|last4=Olivieri|first5=Antonio|last5=Torroni|date=5 October 2015|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|issue=1|pages=14484|doi=10.1038/srep14484|pmid=26434580|pmc=4593049|bibcode=2015NatSR...514484B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study published on the genetic background of Druze communities in Israel showed highly heterogeneous parental origins. A total of 311 Israeli Druze were sampled: 37 from the [[Golan Heights]], 183 from the [[Galilee]], and 35 from [[Mount Carmel]], as well as 27 Druze immigrants from Syria and 29 from Lebanon. The researchers found the following frequencies of Y-chromosomal haplogroups:&lt;ref name=dna1&gt;{{Citation |year=2008|title=The Druze: A Population Genetic Refugium of the Near East |journal=PLOS ONE |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002105 |pmid=18461126 |pmc=2324201 |volume=3 |issue = 5|pages=e2105|bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.2105S |last1=Shlush |first1=LI |last2=Behar |first2=DM |last3=Yudkovsky |first3=G |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|A long list of cryptic data is useless in an encyclopedia for the wider public.

A 2016 study based on testing samples of Druze in the [[Syria (region)]] in comparison with ancient humans (including Anatolian and Armenian), and on Geographic Population Structure (GPS) tool by converting genetic distances into geographic distances, concluded that Druze might hail from the [[Zagros Mountains]] and the surroundings of [[Lake Van]] in eastern [[Anatolia]], then they later migrated south to settle in the mountainous regions in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author1=Scarlett Marshall | author2=Ranajit Das | author3=Mehdi Pirooznia | author4=Eran Elhaik|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep35837 |title=Reconstructing Druze population history | journal=Scientific Reports | volume=6 | pages=35837 |date=16 November 2016 |access-date=30 December 2017| doi=10.1038/srep35837 | pmid=27848937 | pmc=5111078 | bibcode=2016NatSR...635837M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5168">The '''end-of-history illusion''' is a psychological [[illusion]] in which individuals of all ages believe that they have experienced significant [[personal growth]] and changes in [[Taste (sociology)|tastes]] up to the present moment, but will not substantially [[Developmental psychology|grow or mature]] in the future.&lt;ref name="Quoidbach2013" /&gt;  Despite recognizing that their perceptions have evolved, individuals predict that their perceptions will remain roughly the same in the future.

The illusion is based on the fact that at any given developmental stage, an individual can observe a relatively low level of maturity in previous stages. The phenomenon affects teenagers, middle-aged individuals, and seniors. In general, people tend to see significant changes in hindsight, but fail to predict that these changes will continue. For example, a 20-year-old's impression of how great a change they will undergo in the next ten years will not be as extreme as a 30-year-old's recollection of the changes they underwent between the ages of 20 and 30. The same phenomenon is true for people of any age.&lt;ref name="Tierney" /&gt; The reason for the illusion has not been studied, although researchers speculate that a resistance or fear of change may be causal.&lt;ref name="Tierney" /&gt;

Psychologist [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]] gave a [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk about the illusion.&lt;ref name="GilbertTED" /&gt; Gilbert speculates that the phenomenon may occur because of the difficulty of predicting how one will change or a satisfaction with one's current state of being.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2015"/&gt; Gilbert also relates the phenomenon to the way humans perceive time in general.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2015"/&gt;

==Criticism==
The original study that suggested the end-of-history illusion, which was led by Jordi Quoidbach, has been met with criticism for its use of a [[cross-sectional study]] rather than a [[longitudinal study]], which would have lent itself better to the long-term nature of the effect. Critics are also skeptical of the reliability of [[autobiographical memory]].&lt;ref name="Poulsen2013"/&gt;

# Some such propositions are true.
# The truth or falsity of such propositions is ineliminably dependent on the (actual or hypothetical) attitudes of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethical theory; the problems of normative and critical ethics|last=Brandt|first=Richard|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1959|isbn=|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|pages=153|lccn=59010075|quote=[Objectivism and subjectivism] have been used more vaguely, confusedly, and in more different senses than the others we are considering.

This makes ethical subjectivism a form of [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]]. Ethical subjectivism stands in opposition to [[moral realism]], which claims that moral propositions refer to objective facts, independent of human opinion; to [[error theory]], which denies that any moral propositions are true in any sense; and to [[non-cognitivism]], which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all.

The most common forms of ethical subjectivism are also forms of [[moral relativism]], with moral standards held to be relative to each culture or society (c.f. [[cultural relativism]]), or even to every individual. The latter view, as put forward by [[Protagoras]], holds that there are as many distinct scales of good and evil as there are subjects in the world.&lt;ref&gt;"moral subjectivism is that species of moral relativism that relativizes moral value to the individual subject". [http://www.iep.utm.edu/r/relativi.htm Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are also [[moral universalism|universalist]] forms of subjectivism such as [[ideal observer theory]] (which claims that moral propositions are about what attitudes a hypothetical ideal observer would hold). Although [[divine command theory]] is considered to be a form of ethical subjectivism,&lt;ref&gt;"George Hourani is one such philosopher who makes that mistake by misnaming Divine Command theory as 'theistic subjectivism'.".[https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/doi/10.4324/9781315708928.ch25 The Ethics and Metaphysics of Divine Command Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; defenders say it is based on the misunderstanding that divine command proponents claim that moral propositions are about what attitudes God holds, rather than, as [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] claims, if a moral command is or isn't "contrary to the commands of (a loving) God".&lt;ref&gt;"Mark Murphy further explains that a command from God suffices as an 'objective property of actions', as opposed to the attitude within a mind". [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voluntarism-theological/ Theological Voluntarism]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical subjectivism is compatible with [[moral absolutism]], in that the individual or society to whose attitudes moral propositions refer can hold some moral principle to apply regardless of circumstances. (That is, a moral principle can be relative to an individual, but not relative to circumstances). Ethical subjectivism is also compatible with [[moral relativism]] when that is taken to mean the opposite of absolutism, that is, as the claim that moral precepts should be adjusted to circumstances, as in [[consequentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethical theory; the problems of normative and critical ethics|last=Brandt|first=Richard|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1959|isbn=|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|pages=154|lccn=59010075|quote=A subjectivist, clearly, can be either an absolutist or a relativist.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In scholastic [[metaphysics]], a '''formal distinction''' is a distinction intermediate between what is merely conceptual, and what is fully real or mind-independent.  It was made by some realist philosophers of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] period in the thirteenth century, and particularly by [[Duns Scotus]].

== Background ==

Many realist philosophers of the period (such as [[Aquinas]] and [[Henry of Ghent]]), recognised the need for an intermediate distinction that was not merely conceptual, but not fully real or mind-independent either.  Aquinas held that the difference between our concepts arises not just in the mind, but has a foundation in the thing (''fundamentum in re'').  Henry held that there was an 'intentional' distinction (''distinctio intentionalis'') such that 'intentions' (i.e. concepts) that are distinct in the mind, correspond to things which are potentially distinct in reality.

Scotus argued for a formal distinction (''distinctio formalis a parte rei''), which holds between entities which are inseparable and indistinct in reality, but whose definitions are not identical.  For example, the personal properties of the [[Trinity]] are formally distinct from the Divine essence.  Similarly, the distinction between the 'thisness' or ''haecceity'' of a thing and its existence is intermediate between a real and a conceptual distinction.&lt;ref&gt;Honderich p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a formal distinction between the divine attributes and the powers of the soul.

[[William of Ockham|Ockham]] was opposed to the idea, arguing that whenever there is any distinction or non-identity in reality, then two contradictory statements can be made.  But  contradictory statements cannot be truly asserted unless the realities they stand for are either (1) distinct real things (2) distinct concepts or (3) a thing and a concept.  But if they all exist in reality, they are not distinct concepts, nor are they a real thing and a concept.  Therefore, they are distinct in reality.&lt;ref&gt;Ockham, ''Ordinatio'' I. i. q1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Foulsandmisconduct.svg|400px|thumb|right|A [[Venn diagram]] showing the relationship between fouls and misconduct in association football, with examples. The offside offense is an example of a technical rule infraction that is neither a foul nor a misconduct. Note that the referee is given considerable discretion as to the rules' implementation, including deciding which offenses are cautionable "unsportsmanlike" conduct.]]
'''Fouls and misconduct''' in association football are acts committed by players which are deemed by the [[referee (association football)|referee]] to be unfair and are subsequently penalized. An offense may be a foul, misconduct or both depending on the nature of the offence and the circumstances in which it occurs. Fouls and misconduct are addressed in Law 12 of the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]].

A '''foul''' is an unfair act by a player, deemed by the [[referee (association football)|referee]] to contravene the game's laws, that interferes with the active play of the game. Fouls are punished by the award of a free kick (possibly a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]) to the opposing team. A list of specific offences that can be fouls are detailed in Law 12 of the Laws of the Game (other infractions, such as technical infractions at restarts, are not deemed to be fouls); these mostly concern unnecessarily aggressive physical play and the offence of handling the ball. An infringement is classified as a foul when the infringement meets ALL of conditions of: 1) It is committed by a player (not a substitute), 2) on the field of play, 3) while the ball is [[Ball in and out of play|in play]] and 4) committed against an opponent. For example, a player striking the referee or a teammate is not a foul, but is misconduct.&lt;ref name="LOTG2014"&gt;

'''Misconduct''' is any conduct by a player that is deemed by the referee to warrant a disciplinary sanction (caution or dismissal). Misconduct may include acts which are, additionally, fouls. Unlike fouls, misconduct may occur at any time, including when the ball is out of play, during half-time and before and after the game, and both players and [[substitute (football)|substitute]]s may be sanctioned for misconduct.

Misconduct will result in the player either receiving a caution (indicated by a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]]) or being dismissed ("sent off") from the field (indicated by a [[Penalty card#Red card|red card]]).&lt;ref name="LOTG2014"/&gt;{{rp|38}} A dismissed player cannot be replaced; their team is required to play the remainder of the game with one fewer player. A second caution results in the player being dismissed. The referee has considerable discretion in applying the Laws; in particular, the offence of unsporting behavior may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences.&lt;ref name="LOTG2014"/&gt;{{rp|123}}

The system of cautioning and dismissal has existed in the Laws since 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|title=Laws of the Game (1881)|last=|first=|year=|publisher=|page=|wspage=|scan=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Association football was the first major sport to introduce [[penalty card]]s to indicate the referee's decisions; a practice since adopted by many other sports. The first major use of the cards was in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]], but they were not made mandatory at all levels until 1992.&lt;ref name="1992IFAB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Minutes of the Annual General Meeting|url=http://ssbra.solidwebworks.com/lib/IFABarc/pdf/1992/1992min.pdf|website=Soccer South Bay Referee Association|publisher=[[International Football Association Board]]|accessdate=7 January 2015|date=30 May 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories of foul==

===Direct free kick offences===

A [[direct free kick]] is awarded when a player commits any of the following in a manner considered by the referee to be careless, reckless or using excessive force:
 
* Kicks or attempts to kick an opponent
* Trips or attempts to trip an opponent
* Jumps at an opponent 
* Charges an opponent
* Strikes or attempts to strike an opponent
* Pushes an opponent
* Tackles an opponent

Or commits any the following offences:

* Holds an opponent
* Impeding the progress of an opponent with contact
* Spits at an opponent (considered Violent Conduct as the spit is considered an extension of the body)
* Handles the ball deliberately (except for the goalkeeper within their own penalty area).&lt;ref name="LOTG2014" /&gt;{{rp|36}}

In determining whether or not a player deliberately handled the ball, the referee has several considerations:

* Movement of the hand towards the ball (not the ball towards the hand)
* Distance between the opponent and the ball (unexpected ball)
* Position of the hand ('natural' position versus 'unnatural' position) does not necessarily mean that there is an infringement 
* Touching the ball with an object held in the hand (clothing, shinguard, etc.) counts as an infringement (considered an extension of the hand)
* Hitting the ball with a thrown object (boot, shinguard, etc.) counts as an infringement (also considered an extension of the hand)&lt;ref name="LOTG2014" /&gt;{{rp|119}}

If a player commits a direct free kick offence within their own penalty area, a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] is awarded irrespective of the position of the ball, provided the ball is in play.

===Indirect free kick offences===
Infringements punishable by an [[indirect free kick]] are:

*When a goalkeeper, inside their own penalty area:
**controls the ball with their hands for more than six seconds before releasing it from possession
**touches the ball again with their hands after releasing it from possession and before it has touched another player
**touches the ball with their hands after it has been deliberately kicked to them by a teammate, or thrown to them from a throw-in (the [[back-pass rule]])
*When any player in the opinion of the referee:
**plays in a dangerous manner
**impedes the progress of an opponent when the ball is not within playing distance of either player
**prevents the goalkeeper from releasing the ball from their hands
**commits any other offence, not previously mentioned in Law 12, for which play is stopped to caution or send off a player&lt;ref name="LOTG2014" /&gt;{{rp|37}}

Some technical breaches of the rules, such as the [[offside (association football)|offside offence]], result in play being restarted with an indirect free kick, though these are not considered fouls and will never be punished by a caution or dismissal.

===Other offences===
Not all infractions of the Laws are fouls. Non-foul infractions may be dealt with as technical infractions (e.g. as breaching the rules governing the restarts of play) or misconduct (these are punishable by a caution or sending-off). Note that persistent infringement of the Laws is an offence for which the player may be cautioned.&lt;ref name="LOTG2014" /&gt;{{rp|38}}

==Misconduct==
{{anchor|Misconduct Consequences}} &lt;!-- linked from {{TL|Association football laws}} --&gt;
{{see also|Penalty card}}
The referee may consider serious and/or persistent offences to be ''misconduct'' worthy of an official caution or dismissal from the game. Association football was the first sport to use [[penalty cards|coloured cards]] to indicate these actions.&lt;ref name="KenAston"&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/footballdevelopment/technicalsupport/refereeing/news/newsid=80623/index.html | title = Ken Aston - the inventor of yellow and red cards | publisher = fifa.com | accessdate = February 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yellow card (caution)===
[[File:Matt Reis Carlos Ruiz yellow card.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A player is cautioned and shown a yellow card.]]
A yellow card is shown by the [[Referee (association football)|referee]] to indicate that a player has been officially cautioned.&lt;ref name="LOTG2014"/&gt;{{rp|38}} The player's details are then recorded by the referee in a small notebook; hence a caution is also known as a "booking". A player who has been cautioned may continue playing in the game; however, a player who receives a second caution in a match is sent off (shown the yellow card again, and then a red card). Law 12 of the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] lists the types of offences and misconduct that may result in a caution. It also states that "only a player, substitute or substituted player" can be cautioned. A player is cautioned and shown a yellow card if he/she commits any of the following offences:
#[[Unsportsmanlike conduct|Unsporting behaviour]]
#Dissent by word or action
#Persistent infringement of the Laws of the Game
#Delaying the restart of play
#Failure to respect the required distance when play is restarted with a corner kick, throw-in or free kick
#Entering or re-entering the field of play without the referee's permission
#Deliberately leaving the field of play without the referee's permission

What constitutes cautionable unsporting behaviour is generally at the referee's discretion, though the Interpretation and Guidelines which accompany the Laws list a number of examples.&lt;ref name="LOTG2014" /&gt;{{rp|123}} These include [[Diving (association football)|simulation]] intended to deceive the referee, or attempting to score by handling the ball. Fouls which are committed recklessly or fouls which are committed with the intention of breaking up a promising attack are also considered unsporting behaviour and punishable with a yellow card. Fouls which are committed with excessive force, however, or which are deliberately committed to deny an obvious goalscoring opportunity for the player fouled (i.e. a [[professional foul]]),&lt;ref name="BBC_DOGSO_relax" /&gt; are punishable by a red card.

The Laws state that goals may be [[Goal celebration|celebrated]], but that such celebrations should not be "excessive". Removing one's shirt or climbing onto a perimeter fence are listed in the rules as caution-worthy excesses.&lt;ref name="LOTG2014" /&gt;

In most tournaments, the accumulation of a certain number of yellow cards over several matches results in disqualification of the offending player for a certain number of subsequent matches, the exact number of cards and matches varying by jurisdiction. In the [[UEFA Champions League]], for instance, accumulating two yellow cards in a stage of the tournament will lead to a one-game suspension. In such situations players have often been suspected (and occasionally even admitted) to deliberately incur a second booking in a tournament when the following game is of little importance, deliberately resetting their yellow card tally to zero for subsequent games (known as "cleaning cards"). However, while technically within the rules of competition, this is considered unsportsmanlike and UEFA have on occasion threatened additional fines and or suspensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/9244634.stm|title=BBC Sport - Football - Uefa reduces Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho's ban|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/9229485.stm|title=BBC Sport - Football - Uefa investigation into red cards surprises Real Madrid|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 IFAB approved temporary dismissals ([[sin-bin]]s) for cautionable offences similar to that seen in other sports; however, this is only permitted for youth, veterans, disability and grassroots football. Competitions' use of this system—rather than 'normal' yellow cards—is optional, and there are variations in how it can be implemented. For 90-minute games, the length of the temporary dismissal is 10 minutes.&lt;ref name="IFAB-sinbins"&gt;{{cite web|title=GUIDELINES FOR TEMPORARY DISMISSALS (SIN BINS)|url=http://www.theifab.com/laws/modifications-to-the-laws/chapters/guidelines-for-temporary-dismissals-sin-bins|publisher=IFAB|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red card (dismissal)===
[[File:Rote Karte-RB Salzburg crop.png|180px|thumb|A player is shown a red card to indicate his dismissal from the game.]]
A red card is shown by a [[Referee (association football)|referee]] to signify that a player must be sent off.&lt;ref name="LOTG2014"/&gt;{{rp|38}} A player who has been sent off is required to leave the field of play immediately, must take no further part in the game and cannot be replaced by a substitute, forcing their team to play with one less player. Only players, substitutes and substituted players may receive a red card. If a team's goalkeeper receives a red card another player is required to assume goalkeeping duties, so teams usually [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] another goalkeeper for an outfield player if they still have substitutes available.

Law 12 of the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] lists the categories of misconduct for which a player may be sent off. These are:
#Serious foul play
#Violent conduct
#Spitting at an opponent or any other person
#Denying the opposing team a goal or an obvious goalscoring opportunity by deliberately handling the ball (this does not apply to a goalkeeper within their own penalty area)
#Deliberate fouls that deny an obvious goalscoring opportunity to an opponent moving towards the player's goal (D.O.G.S.O.)&lt;ref name=BBC_DOGSO_relax&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36047575 Denying a goalscoring opportunity: Red card rule relaxed by IFAB]. BBC. 14 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
#Using offensive, insulting or abusive language and/or gestures
#Receiving a second caution in the same match&lt;ref name="LOTG2014"/&gt;{{rp|39}}

Serious foul play is a foul committed using excessive force (i.e., "the player...is deliberately or attempting to injuring his/her opponent").&lt;ref name="LOTG2014"/&gt;{{rp|117}} Violent conduct is distinct from serious foul play in that it may be committed by any player, substitute, or substituted player against any person, e.g., teammates, match officials, or spectators.&lt;ref name="LOTG2014"/&gt;{{rp|127}}

Once a player has been sent off, they are not permitted to stay in the team's [[technical area]], but must leave the immediate field or playing area.&lt;ref name="footballbible"&gt;{{cite web |title=Soccer red card rules {{!}} Football red cards, offenses, violations, laws |url=https://www.football-bible.com/soccer-info/soccer-red-card.html |website=www.football-bible.com |accessdate=26 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most tournaments, a single ''direct'' red card (i.e. not one received as a result of two successive yellow ones) results in disqualification of the offending player for one or more subsequent matches, with the exact number of matches varying by the offence committed and by jurisdiction.

Should a team's on-field players receive a total of five red cards, it will be unable to field the required minimum of seven players, resulting in the game being terminated.

===History and origin===
The practice of cautioning and excluding players who make serious breaches of the rules has been part of the Laws of the Game since 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1881)
|wslink=Laws of the Game (1881)|year=1881 |publisher=The Football Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the practice of using [[Penalty card|language-neutral coloured cards]] to indicate these actions did not follow for almost 90 years.

The idea originated with British [[Association football|football]] referee [[Ken Aston]].&lt;ref name="KenAston"/&gt; Aston had been appointed to the [[FIFA]] Referees' Committee and was responsible for all referees at the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]]. In the [[1966 World Cup#Quarter-finals|quarter finals]], [[1966 FIFA World Cup squads#England|England]] met [[1966 FIFA World Cup squads#Argentina|Argentina]] at [[Wembley Stadium]]. After the match, newspaper reports stated that referee [[Rudolf Kreitlein]] had cautioned both [[Bobby Charlton|Bobby]] and [[Jack Charlton]], as well as sending off Argentinian Antonio Rattin. The referee had not made his decision clear during the game, and England manager [[Alf Ramsey]] approached FIFA for post-match clarification. This incident started Aston thinking about ways to make a referee's decisions clearer to both players and spectators. Aston realised that a colour-coding scheme based on the same principle as used on [[traffic lights]] (yellow - caution, red - stop) would traverse language barriers and clarify whether a player had been cautioned or expelled.&lt;ref name=KenAston/&gt; As a result, yellow cards to indicate a caution and red cards to indicate an expulsion were used for the first time in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] in Mexico (though no players were sent off in that tournament). The use of [[penalty card]]s has since been adopted and expanded by several sporting codes, with each sport adapting the idea to its specific set of rules or laws.

==Frequency==
Fouls are fairly common occurrences in games. For example the 2012–13 football season saw fouls-per-game rates in the major European leagues ranging from 23 in the [[2012-13 Premier League]] to 32 in the [[2012-13 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]].&lt;ref name="PL_fouls"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jurejko |first1=Jonathan |title=Fouls in Premier League have dropped by 22% since 2006 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22253531 |accessdate=26 June 2018 |work=BBC Sport |date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yellow cards are less common, though a typical game will feature a few — at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup disciplinary record|2014 FIFA World Cup]] there were, on average, about three cautions per game. Dismissals are much rarer, that same tournament saw an average of 0.2 red cards per match.&lt;ref name="2014WCstats"&gt;{{cite web |title=2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ - Statistics - FIFA.com |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/brazil2014/statistics/index.html |website=FIFA.com |accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Referee's discretion==
The referee has a very large degree of discretion as to the enforcement of the 17 Laws including determining which acts constitute cautionable offences under the very broad categories. For this reason, refereeing decisions are sometimes controversial. Some Laws may specify circumstances under which a caution should or must be given, and numerous directives to referees also provide additional guidance. The encouragement for referees to use their [[common sense]] is known colloquially as "Law 18".&lt;ref name=S4D/&gt;

==Advantage==

According to the principle of advantage, play should be allowed to continue when an offence occurs and the non-offending team will benefit from ongoing play. If the anticipated advantage does not ensue at that time or within a few seconds, the referee penalises the offence. The referee indicates that advantage is being played by extending either one arm or both arms in front of the body (until June 2016, it could only be both arms).&lt;ref name="laws2017-law5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theifab.com/backend/library/doc/laws-of-the-game-201718-english-single-page |work=Laws of the Game 2017-18 |date=2017-05-22 |publisher=[[International Football Association Board]] |location=[[Zurich]] |accessdate= 2017-11-18 |title=Law 5 - The Referee |pages=61–67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some sets of recommendations for referees advise calling "play on!" or "advantage!" when the signal is given but such recommendations are not contained in the Laws of the Game document.&lt;ref name=S4D&gt;{{cite book|author1=United States Soccer Federation Inc.,|author2=Michael Lewis|title=Soccer for dummies|date=2000|publisher=IDG Books Worldwide|location=Foster City, CA|isbn=1118053575|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lp7ZmTfl_ckC|accessdate= 2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IFAB's Practical Guidelines for Match Officials outlines the considerations a referee must make when deciding whether to play advantage; these include the severity and position of the offence, the potential for an immediate promising attack and the atmosphere of the match.&lt;ref name="laws2017-PGMO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theifab.com/backend/library/doc/laws-of-the-game-201718-english-single-page |work=Laws of the Game 2017-18 |date=2017-05-22 |publisher=[[International Football Association Board]] |location=[[Zurich]] |accessdate= 2017-11-18 |title=Practical Guidelines for Match Officials |pages=173–202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|194}}

Advantage can also be applied even if the referee decides to caution the player for an offence. Play is allowed to continue, but at the next stoppage in play the caution must be issued and the yellow card displayed. However, advantage should not be applied in situations involving serious foul play, violent conduct or a second cautionable offence unless there is a clear opportunity to score a goal. In this situation, if the player who committed the offence for which the advantage is being played touches the ball or challenges/interferes with an opponent, the referee will stop play, send off the player and restart with an indirect free kick, unless the player committed a more serious offence.&lt;ref name="laws2017-law12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theifab.com/backend/library/doc/laws-of-the-game-201718-english-single-page |work=Laws of the Game 2017-18 |date=2017-05-22 |publisher=[[International Football Association Board]] |location=[[Zurich]] |accessdate= 2017-11-18 |title=Law 12 - Fouls and Misconduct |pages=96–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restarts==
If the ball is out of play when an infraction of the Laws of the Game occurs, play is restarted according to the reason the ball became out of play before the infraction. (Any infraction of the Laws of the Game that occurs while the ball is out of play can be misconduct, but is not a foul.)

If the misconduct occurs when the ball is in play, play need not be stopped to administer a caution or a dismissal, as these may be done at the next stoppage of play (this is usually the case when the opposing team would gain an advantage in having play continue). When this is the case, play is restarted according to the reason for the ball becoming out of play, e.g. a [[throw-in]] if play stopped due to the ball crossing a touchline.

If play is stopped to administer a caution or dismissal:
* If a foul has occurred as well as misconduct, play is restarted according to the nature of the foul (either an [[indirect free kick]], [[direct free kick]] or [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] to the opposing team)
* If no foul under Law 12 has occurred, play is restarted with an indirect free kick to the opposing team

==Team officials==
Team officials such as managers and coaches are not subject to the cautionable and sending-off offences listed above, as these apply only to players, substitutes, and substituted players. However, according to Law 5 the referee "takes action against team officials who fail to conduct themselves in a responsible manner and may, at his discretion, expel them from the field of play and its immediate surroundings."&lt;ref name="LOTG2014"/&gt;{{rp|24}} No card would be displayed when taking such action.

The league sanction for a sent-off coach or manager is normally a ban from being in the dugout or in the changing room for a certain number of matches thereafter. The particular football association determines the length of the ban and/or other appropriate action(s).

Beginning in 2018, IFAB have authorised trials in which team officials can be cautioned and dismissed with the display of cards in the same manner as players.&lt;ref name="managers_trial"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fisher |first1=Ben |title=Football League managers to be shown yellow and red cards in new regulations |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/31/efl-managers-red-yellow-cards |accessdate=1 August 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=31 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-match penalties==
Many football leagues and federations impose off-field penalties for players who accumulate a certain number of cautions in a season, tournament or phase of a tournament. Typically, these take the form of suspending a player from playing in his team's next game(s) after reaching a particular number of cautions. Such off-field penalties are determined by league rules, and not by the Laws of the Game.

Similarly, a direct red card usually also results in additional sanctions, most commonly in the form of suspensions from playing for a number of future games, although financial fines may also be imposed. The exact punishments are determined by tournament or competition rules, and not by the Laws of the Game. FIFA in particular has been adamant that a red card in any football competition must result in the guilty player being suspended for at least the next game, with the only grounds of appeal being mistaken identity.&lt;ref name=FIFAred&gt;{{cite news|title=Fifa change red card rules|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/sep/24/newsstory.sport8|accessdate=4 October 2014|work=Guardian|date=24 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], any player receiving two yellow cards during the three group stage matches, or two yellow cards in the knockout stage matches had to serve a one-match suspension for the next game. A single yellow card did not carry over from the group stage to the knockout stages. Should the player pick up his second yellow during the team's final group match, he would miss the Round of 16 if his team qualified for it. However, suspensions due to yellow cards do not carry beyond the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup finals]].

For the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], the rules were changed so that any player who received two yellow cards between the beginning of the tournament and the end of the quarterfinal round (instead of the end of the group stage matches) would serve a one-match suspension for the next game. As a result, only players that received a red card (whether directly or after a second booking) in the semifinal game would not be able to play in the final.

In the UEFA Champions League, for instance, accumulating two yellow cards in a stage of the tournament will lead to a one-game suspension. Incidents have been recorded where players intentionally collected a second yellow card so they are suspended for a meaningless final group game, so as to "strategically" reset their tally of yellow cards to zero for the knockout round (known as "clearing cards"), but this is considered unsportsmanlike with UEFA levying fines and/or suspensions.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/9244634.stm ''Uefa reduces Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho's ban''], BBC Sport website, 6 December 2010, also [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/9229485.stm ''Uefa investigation into red cards surprises Real Madrid''], ibid., 26 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In some league/group competitions, a team's fair play record, as measured by the total number of yellow and red cards acquired by a team, may be used as a potential tie-breaking method to determine final table position.&lt;ref name="regulations"&gt;For example [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying#Tiebreakers|in the qualifying stages]] of [[UEFA Euro 2016]]: {{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Regulations/uefaorg/Regulations/02/03/92/81/2039281_DOWNLOAD.pdf|title=Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2014–16|publisher=UEFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Chaos magic}}In [[chaos magic]], "gnosis" or "the gnostic state" refers to an [[altered state of consciousness]] in which a person's mind is focused on [[Samadhi|only one point]], thought, or goal and all other thoughts are thrust out.&lt;ref name=Hine2&gt;[[#refHine2|Hine, Phil. ''Prime Chaos'']]&lt;/ref&gt; The gnostic state is used to bypass the "filter" of the conscious mind – something thought to be necessary for working most forms of magic.&lt;ref name=Carroll2&gt;[[#refCarroll2|Carroll, Peter J. ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it takes years of training to master this sort of Zen-like meditative ability, chaos magicians employ a variety of other ways to attain a "brief 'no-mind' state" in which to work magic.&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;[[#refMorrison|Morrison, Grant. ''Pop Magic!'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
'''Gnosis''' is the common [[Greek language|Greek]] noun for [[knowledge]] ([[wikt:γνῶσις|γνῶσις]], ''gnôsis'', f.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stanley E. Porter|author2=David Yoon|title=Paul and Gnosis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cc0JDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9 |year=2016|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-31669-0 |pages=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A related term is the adjective ''gnostikos'', "cognitive",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=gnwstikos&amp;la=greek#lexicon LSJ entry] '''γνωστ-ικός , ή, όν,'''

Adv. “-κῶς” Procl.Inst.39, Dam.Pr.79, Phlp.in Ph.241.22.&lt;/ref&gt; a reasonably common adjective in Classical Greek.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/wordfreq?lang=greek&amp;lookup=gnwstiko%2Fs In Perseus databank] 10x [[Plato]], Cratylus, Theaetetus, Sophist, Statesman 2x [[Plutarch]], Compendium libri de animae procreatione + De animae procreatione in Timaeo, 2x [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], De musica&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] uses the plural adjective γνωστικοί – ''gnostikoi'' and the singular feminine adjective γνωστικὴ ἐπιστήμη – ''gnostike episteme'' in his ''[[Politikos]]'' where ''Gnostike episteme'' was also used to indicate one's [[aptitude]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper and Hutchinson. "Introduction to Politikos." Cooper, John M. &amp; Hutchinson, D. S. (Eds.) (1997). Plato: Complete Works, Hackett Publishing Co., Inc. {{ISBN|0-87220-349-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Chaos Magic ==

According to [[chaos magic]], successfully executing an act of [[magic_(paranormal)|magic]] is dependent on bypassing the conscious mind. To achieve this, it is necessary to enter into an [[altered state of consciousness]] in which thoughts are stilled, and awareness is held on [[Samadhi|a single point]]. Only then will the [[ritual]], [[Sigil_(magic)|sigil]] or working flow unimpeded into the unconscious, from where it works its effects.&lt;ref name=Carroll2&gt;[[#refCarroll2|Carroll, Peter J. ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherwin1&gt;[[#refSherwin1|Sherwin, Ray. ''The Book of Results'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Without any etymological justification, the earliest texts on chaos magic, ''Liber Null'' (1978) and ''The Book of Results'' (1978), both refer to this state of one-pointedness as "gnosis":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The particular state of mind required has a name in every tradition: No-mind. Stopping the internal dialogue, passing through the eye of the needle, ''ain'' or nothing, ''samadhi'', or onepointedness. In this book it will be known as ''Gnosis''. It is an extension of the magical trance by other means.&lt;ref name=Carroll2&gt;[[#refCarroll2|Carroll, Peter J. ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In asserting the necessity of attaining such a state, the earliest chaos magicians were following the example set by artist and occultist [[Austin Osman Spare]]. In Spare's magical system, magic was thought to operate by using symbols to communicate ''desire'' to something Spare termed "Kia" (a sort of universal mind, of which individual human consciousnesses are aspects) via the "passage" of the unconscious. These desires would then grow, unconsciously, into "obsessions", which would culminate in magical results occurring in reality.&lt;ref name=Spare1&gt;[[#refSpare1|Spare, Austin Osman. ''The Book of Pleasure'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;[[#refBaker|Baker, Phil. ''Austin Osman Spare'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aleister Crowley]] had also argued that the key to magic was an altered state of consciousness, whether attained through [[meditation]], [[Sex_magic|sexual practices]] or the [[Entheogen|use of drugs]].&lt;ref name=Crowley1&gt;[[#refCrowley1|Crowley, Aleister. ''Book 4'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; However, the real breakthrough of the early chaos magicians was the realisation that there are many states of exhaustion, arousal or inhibition that cause consciousness to briefly "blink", sidestepping the need for years of meditative attainment.&lt;ref name=Carroll2&gt;[[#refCarroll2|Carroll, Peter J. ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;[[#refMorrison|Morrison, Grant. ''Pop Magic!'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

Three main types of gnosis are described in chaos magic texts:&lt;ref name=Vitimus&gt;[[#refVitimus|Vitimus, Andrieh. ''Hands-on Chaos Magic'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Inhibitory gnosis]]''' is a form of deep [[meditation]] into a [[trance]] state of [[mind]]. This type of [[gnosis]] uses slow and regular [[breath]]ing techniques, absent thought processes, [[progressive muscle relaxation]], self-induction and [[self-hypnosis]] techniques. Means employed may also include [[fasting]], [[sleeplessness]], [[sensory deprivation]] and [[hypnotic]] or trance-inducing drugs.
* '''Ecstatic gnosis''' describes a mindlessness reached through intense [[arousal]]. It is aimed to be reached through [[sexual arousal|sexual excitation]], intense [[emotion]]s, [[flagellation]], [[dance]], [[drum]]ming, [[chanting]], [[sensory overload]], [[hyperventilation]] and the use of disinhibitory or hallucinogenic drugs.
* '''Indifferent vacuity''' was described by [[Phil Hine]] and [[Jan Fries]] as a third method. Here the intended spell is cast parenthetically, so it does not raise much thought to suppress.&lt;ref name=Fries2&gt;[[#refFries2|Fries, Jan. ''Visual Magick'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hine2&gt;[[#refHine2|Hine, Phil. ''Prime Chaos'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gustav Bergmann''' (May 4, 1906&amp;nbsp;– April 21, 1987) was an Austrian-born American philosopher. He studied at the [[University of Vienna]] and was a member of the [[Vienna Circle]]. Bergmann was influenced by the philosophers [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Friedrich Waismann]], and [[Rudolf Carnap]] who were members of the Circle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://clas.uiowa.edu/philosophy/resources/gustav-bergmann "Gustav Bergmann" (clas.uiowa.edu)]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], he was a professor of [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] at the [[University of Iowa]].

== Biography ==
Bergmann was born in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]]. He earned his Ph.D. in mathematics at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1928. His dissertation, directed by [[Walther Mayer]], was titled ''Zwei Beiträge zur mehrdimensionalen Differentialgeometrie''. While studying for his [[doctorate]], he was invited to join the [[Vienna Circle]], a group of philosophers, mathematicians, scientists, and others committed to a scientific worldview under the name of [[logical positivism]]. In 1930–31, he worked with [[Albert Einstein]] in Berlin. Unable as a Jew to find academic employment, Bergmann obtained a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from the University of Vienna in 1935, and practiced [[corporate law]] until he and his family fled to the United States in 1938. Settling at the [[University of Iowa]] in [[Iowa City]] in 1939, Bergmann eventually became professor of both philosophy and psychology.

He died in Iowa City.

'''Herbert Lionel Adolphus Hart''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] ({{IPAc-en|h|ɑr|t}}; 18 July 1907 – 19 December 1992), usually cited as '''H. L. A. Hart''', was a British [[Jurisprudence|legal philosopher]], and a major figure in political and legal philosophy. He was [[Professor of Jurisprudence (University of Oxford)|Professor of Jurisprudence]] at [[Oxford University]] and the Principal of [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose College]], Oxford. His most famous work is ''[[The Concept of Law]]'' (1961; 3rd edition, 2012), which has been hailed as "the most important work of legal philosophy written in the twentieth century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Concept of Law (Clarendon Law) (Clarendon Law Series)|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Concept-Law-Clarendon/dp/0199644705/ref=dp_ob_title_bk|website=Amazon|publisher=Clarendon Law Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered one of the world's foremost legal philosophers in the twentieth century, alongside [[Hans Kelsen]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew Kramer|Matthew H. Kramer]] and Claire Grant (2008). "Introduction", in Satthew H. Kramer, Claire Grant, Ben Colburn, and Anthony Hatzistavrou (ed.): ''The Legacy of H.L.A. Hart: Legal, Political and Moral Philosophy''. Oxford/New York, Oxford University Press, xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biographical sketch==
Herbert Hart was born in 1907, the son of Rose Samson Hart and Simeon Hart, in [[Harrogate]],&lt;ref&gt;Mullender, Richard: [http://webjcli.ncl.ac.uk/2007/issue5/mullender5.html "Nicola Lacey, ''A Life of H.L.A. Hart: the Nightmare and the Noble Dream'' – H.L.A. Hart in Anglo-American Context"], Web Journal of Current Legal Issues (review 2007). Oxford University Press, (2004). {{ISBN|978-0-19-920277-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which his parents had moved from the [[East End of London]]. His father was a [[Jew]]ish tailor of German and Polish origin; his mother, of Polish origin, daughter of successful retailers in the clothing trade, handled customer relations and the finances of their firm. Hart had an elder brother, Albert, and a younger sister, Sybil.

Hart was educated at [[Cheltenham College]], [[Bradford Grammar School]] and at [[New College, Oxford]]. He took a First in [[Literae Humaniores|Classical Greats]] in 1929.&lt;ref name="Sugarman"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Sugarman|first1= David|last2= Hart|first2= H. L. A.|year= 2005|title= Hart Interviewed: H.L.A. Hart in Conversation with David Sugarman|journal= Journal of Law and Society|volume= 32|issue= 2|pages= 267–293|publisher= Blackwell|jstor= 3557228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart became a [[barrister]] and practised successfully at the Chancery Bar from 1932 to 1940. He was good friends with [[Richard Wilberforce|Richard (later Lord) Wilberforce]], [[Douglas Jay, Baron Jay|Douglas Jay]], and Christopher Cox, among others. He received a Harmsworth Scholarship to the [[Middle Temple]] and also wrote literary journalism for the periodical ''[[John O'London's Weekly]]''.&lt;ref name="Sugarman" /&gt;

During [[World War II]], Hart worked with [[MI5]], a division of British military intelligence concerned with unearthing spies who had penetrated Britain, where he renewed Oxford friendships including working with the philosophers [[Gilbert Ryle]] and [[Stuart Hampshire]]. He worked closely with [[Dick White]], later head of MI5 and then of [[MI6]]. Hart worked at [[Bletchley Park]] and was a colleague of the mathematician and codebreaker [[Alan Turing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X_KOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37 | title=Defending the Genetic Supermarket: The Law and Ethics of Selecting the Next Generation | series=Biomedical Law and Ethics Library | first=Colin | last=Gavaghan | publisher=[[Routledge]] | year=2007 | isbn=978-1135392932 | page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart's war work took him on occasion to MI5 offices at [[Blenheim Palace]], family home of the [[Dukes of Marlborough]] and the place where [[Winston Churchill]] had been born.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}  He enjoyed telling the story that there he was able to read the diaries of [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough]], wife of the founder of the dynasty [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]].  Hart's wit and humanity are demonstrated by the fact that he particularly enjoyed the passage where Sarah tells that John had been away for a long time, had arrived suddenly, and "enjoyed me straight way in his boots".  Another incident of life at Blenheim which Hart enjoyed recounting was that he shared an office with one of the famous Cambridge spies, [[Anthony Blunt]], a fellow member of MI5.  Hart wondered which of the papers on his desk Blunt had managed to read and to pass on to his Soviet controllers.

Hart did not return to his legal practice after the War, preferring instead to accept the offer of a teaching fellowship (in philosophy, not Law) at New College, Oxford. Hart cites [[J. L. Austin]] as particularly influential during this time.&lt;ref name="Sugarman" /&gt; The two jointly taught from 1948 a seminar on 'Legal and Moral Responsibility'. Among Hart's publications at this time were the essays 'A Logician's Fairytale', 'Is There Knowledge by Acquaintance?', 'Law and Fact' and 'The Ascription of Responsibility and Rights'.

In 1952, Hart was elected [[Professor of Jurisprudence (University of Oxford)|Professor of Jurisprudence]] at Oxford and was a Fellow at [[University College, Oxford]] from 1952 to 1973.&lt;ref name="darwall-smith08"&gt;{{cite book| last=Darwall-Smith | first=Robin | title=A History of University College, Oxford | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | date=2008 | isbn=978-0-19-928429-0 | pages=486, 492–4, 501, 504, 513, 536 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in the summer of that year that he began writing his most famous book, ''[[The Concept of Law]]'', though it was not published until 1961. In the interim, he published another major work, ''Causation in the Law'' (with Tony Honoré) (1959). He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1959 to 1960.

Hart married [[Jenifer Hart|Jenifer Fischer Williams]], a civil servant, later a senior civil servant, in the Home Office and, still later, Oxford historian at [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St Anne's College]] (specialising in the history of the police).&lt;ref&gt;[http://spartacus-educational.com/Jenifer_Hart.htm Biography of Jenifer Hart]&lt;/ref&gt; Jenifer Hart was, for some years in the mid-1930s and fading out totally by decade's end, a 'sleeper' member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]. Three decades later she was interviewed by [[Peter Wright]] as having been in a position to have passed information to the Soviets, and to Wright, MI5's official spy hunter, she explained her situation; Wright took no action. In fact her work as civil servant was in fields such as family policy and so would have been of no interest to the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1487412/Jenifer-Hart.html Obituary of Jenifer Hart], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 9 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The person who recruited her, [[Bernard Floud]], interviewed by Wright shortly after, maintained that he was unable to remember ever having done so. Nor was her husband in a position to convey to her information of use, despite vague newspaper suggestions, given the sharp separation of his work from that of foreign affairs and its focus on German spies and British turncoats rather than on matters related to the Soviet ally. In fact, Hart was anticommunist.

The marriage contained "incompatible personalities", though it lasted right to the end of their lives and gave joy to both at times. Hart did joke with his daughter at one point, however, that "[t]he trouble with this marriage is that one of us doesn't like sex and the other doesn't like food".&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Howatson, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jenifer-hart-530553.html Obituary: Jenifer Hart,] ''The Independent'', 31 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Jenifer Hart was believed by her contemporaries to have had an affair of long duration with [[Isaiah Berlin]], a close friend of Hart's. Jenifer published her memoirs under the title ''Ask Me No More'' in 1998. The Harts had four children, including, late in life, a son who was disabled, the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck having deprived his brain of oxygen. The boy was, despite his handicap, capable of remarkable observations on occasion. As a philosopher, Hart had long been interested in the [[mind-body problem]], and he was thus in some sense professionally interested in his son, as well as emotionally invested, if only because his child was first-hand proof of the complex and unpredictable nature of the relationship between mind and body.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Hart's granddaughter [[Mojo Mathers]] became New Zealand's first deaf Member of Parliament in 2011.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

There is a description of the Hart's household by the writer on religion [[Karen Armstrong]], who lodged with them for a time to help take care of their disabled son. The description appears in her book ''The Spiral Staircase''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publisher = HarperPerennial | isbn = 978-0-00-712229-5 | title = The Spiral Staircase | url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL9216389M/The_Spiral_Staircase | first=Karen | last=Armstrong | publication-date = 3 January 2005|id = 0007122292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart retired from the Chair of Jurisprudence in 1969 and was succeeded by [[Ronald Dworkin]]. He subsequently became Principal of [[Brasenose College, Oxford]].

Hart died in Oxford in 1992, aged 85. He is buried there in Wolvercote Cemetery. [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s grave is nearby.

==Hart's students==
Many of Hart's former students became important legal, moral, and political philosophers, including [[Brian Barry]], [[John Finnis]], [[John Gardner (lawyer)|John Gardner]], [[Kent Greenawalt]], [[Neil MacCormick]], [[William Twining]], [[Chin Liew Ten]], [[Joseph Raz]] and [[Ronald Dworkin]]. Hart also had a strong influence on the young [[John Rawls]] in the 1950s, when Rawls was a visiting scholar at Oxford shortly after finishing his PhD. Also, conspicuously, [[Peter Hacker]], who took his D.Phil under Hart's supervision, then went in 1966 at then President J.D. Mabbott's invitation, to be philosophy tutor at St John's, Oxford, where he attained career distinction in providing definitive analytic commentaries on Wittgenstein's writings.

==Philosophical method==
Hart strongly influenced the application of methods in his version of Anglo-American positive law to jurisprudence and the philosophy of law in the English-speaking world. Influenced by [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Hans Kelsen]], Hart brought the tools of analytic, and especially linguistic, philosophy to bear on the central problems of legal theory.

Hart's method combined the careful analysis of twentieth-century analytic philosophy with the jurisprudential tradition of [[Jeremy Bentham]], the great English legal, political, and moral philosopher. Hart's conception of law had parallels to the [[Pure Theory of Law]] formulated by Austrian legal philosopher [[Hans Kelsen]], though Hart rejected several distinctive features of Kelsen's theory.

Significant in the differences between Hart and Kelsen was the emphasis on the British version of positive law theory which Hart was defending as opposed to the Continental version of positive law theory which Kelsen was defending. This was studied in the University of Toronto Law Journal in an article titled "Leaving the Hart-Dworkin Debate" which maintained that Hart insisted in his book ''The Concept of Law'' on the expansive reading of positive law theory to include philosophical and sociological domains of assessment rather than the more focused attention of Kelsen who considered Continental positive law theory as more limited to the domain of jurisprudence itself.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Culver. "Leaving the Hart-Dworkin Debate', University of Toronto Law Journal, pp374-398.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart drew, among others, on [[Glanville Williams]] who had demonstrated his legal philosophy in a five-part article, "Language and the Law" and in a paper, "International Law and the Controversy Concerning the Word 'Law'". In the paper on international law, he sharply attacked the many jurists and international lawyers who had debated whether international law was "really" law. They had been wasting everyone's time, for the question was not a factual one, the many differences between municipal and international law being undeniable, but was simply one of conventional verbal usage, about which individual theorists could please themselves, but had no right to dictate to others.

This approach was to be refined and developed by Hart in the last chapter of ''The Concept of Law'' (1961), which showed how the use in respect of different social phenomena of an abstract word like ''law'' reflected the fact that these phenomena each shared, without necessarily all possessing in common, some distinctive features. Glanville had himself said as much when editing a student text on jurisprudence and he had adopted essentially the same approach to "The Definition of Crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=FcYwm5C4U4IC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=This+approach+was+to+be+refined+and+developed+by+Hart+in+the+last+chapter+of+The+Concept+of+Law+(1961),+which+showed+how+the+use+in+respect+of+different+social+phenomena+of+an+abstract+word+like+law+reflected+the+fact+that+these+phenomena+each+shared,+without+necessarily+all+possessing+in+common,+some+distinctive+features.+Glanville+had+himself+said+as+much+when+editing+a+student+text+on+jurisprudence+and+he+had+adopted+essentially+the+same+approach+to+%22The+Definition+of+Crime%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zDQNuvAPdX&amp;sig=BEhsvWQ-0bXNcPv01HFRdbubw00&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjfzJ-cgu7eAhWM0VQKHejpDkgQ6AEwAXoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=This%20approach%20was%20to%20be%20refined%20and%20developed%20by%20Hart%20in%20the%20last%20chapter%20of%20The%20Concept%20of%20Law%20(1961),%20which%20showed%20how%20the%20use%20in%20respect%20of%20different%20social%20phenomena%20of%20an%20abstract%20word%20like%20law%20reflected%20the%20fact%20that%20these%20phenomena%20each%20shared,%20without%20necessarily%20all%20possessing%20in%20common,%20some%20distinctive%20features.%20Glanville%20had%20himself%20said%20as%20much%20when%20editing%20a%20student%20text%20on%20jurisprudence%20and%20he%20had%20adopted%20essentially%20the%20same%20approach%20to%20%22The%20Definition%20of%20Crime%22&amp;f=false|title=The Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law: The Legacy of Glanville Williams|last=Baker|first=Dennis J.|last2=Horder|first2=Jeremy|date=2013-02-14|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107020474|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Concept of Law''==
{{Main article|The Concept of Law}}
Hart's most famous work is ''The Concept of Law'', first published in 1961, and with a second edition (including a new postscript) published posthumously in 1994. The book emerged from a set of lectures that Hart began to deliver in 1952, and it is presaged by his Holmes lecture, ''Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals'', delivered at Harvard Law School. ''The Concept of Law'' developed a sophisticated view of legal positivism. Among the many ideas developed in this book are:
* A critique of [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin's]] theory that law is the command of the sovereign backed by the threat of punishment.
* A distinction between primary and secondary legal rules, such that a primary rule governs conduct, such as criminal law, and secondary rules govern the procedural methods by which primary rules are enforced, prosecuted and so on. Hart specifically enumerates three secondary rules; they are:
:* The [[Rule of Recognition]], the rule by which any member of society may check to discover what the primary rules of the society are. In a simple society, Hart states, the recognition rule might only be what is written in a sacred book or what is said by a ruler. Hart claimed the concept of rule of recognition as an evolution from [[Hans Kelsen]]'s "''[[Grundnorm]]''", or "basic norm".
:* The Rule of Change, the rule by which existing primary rules might be created, altered or deleted.
:* The Rule of Adjudication, the rule by which the society might determine when a rule has been violated and prescribe a remedy.
* A distinction between the internal and external points of view of law and rules, close to (and influenced by) [[Max Weber]]'s distinction between legal and sociological perspectives in description of law.
* A concept of "open-textured" terms in law, along the lines of Wittgenstein and Waisman, and "defeasible" terms (later famously disavowed):  both are ideas popular in [[Artificial intelligence and law]]
* A late reply (published as a postscript to the second edition) to [[Ronald Dworkin]], a rights-oriented legal philosopher (and Hart's successor at Oxford) who criticised Hart's version of legal positivism in ''[[Taking Rights Seriously]]'' (1977), ''A Matter of Principle'' (1985) and ''[[Law's Empire]]'' (1986).

==Other work==
With [[Tony Honoré]], Hart wrote and published ''Causation in the Law'' (1959, second edition 1985), which is regarded as one of the important academic discussions of causation in the legal context. The early chapters deal philosophically with the concept of cause and are clearly the work of Hart, while later chapters deal with individual cases in English law and are clearly his co-author's.

As a result of his famous debate with [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin]], on the role of the criminal law in enforcing moral norms, Hart wrote ''Law, Liberty and Morality'' (1963), which consisted of three lectures he gave at [[Stanford University]]. He also wrote ''The Morality of the Criminal Law'' (1965). Hart said that he believed Devlin's view of Mill's harm principle as it related to the decriminalisation of homosexuality was "perverse".&lt;ref&gt;Hart. H. L. A. "Immorality and Treason·, The Listener (July 30, 1959). 162-63. Reprinted in Wasserstrom, Richard A. (ed.). Morality and the Law. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; He later stated that he believed the reforms to the law regarding homosexuality that followed the [[Wolfenden report]] "didn't go far enough". Despite this, Hart reported later that he got on well personally with Devlin.&lt;ref name="Sugarman" /&gt;

Hart gave lectures to the Labour Party on closing tax loopholes which were being used by the "[[ultra high-net-worth individual|super-rich]]". Hart considered himself to be "on the Left, the non-communist Left", and expressed animosity towards [[Margaret Thatcher]].&lt;ref name="Sugarman" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2080">'''Harold Foster Hallet''' (1886 - 1966), - British philosopher, was born in 1886.

From 1904 to 1908 - shipyard of Messrs Young and Co at Poplar.

1908 - BSc in Engineering from the University of London.

In 1912 he gained an MA in Mental Philosophy from the University of Edinburgh.

In 1912-1916 - Lecturer in Logic, and Assistant in Logic and Metaphysics.

In 1915-1916 - Assistant in Moral Philosophy.

In 1919-1922 - Assistant Lecturer at the [[University of Leeds]].

In 1922-1931 - Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Leeds.

From 1931 to 1951 - Professor of Philosophy at [[King's College London]].

In 1929-1935 Hallett - British Secretary of the [[Societas Spinoza]].

In 1935-1945 - Chairman of the Board of Philosophical Studies at the [[University of London]].

He is the author of numerous books and articles on philosophy. Most noteworty is his seminal work in the philosophy of Baruch Spinoza. His "Spinoza The Elements of His Philosophy" stands as the most comprehensive and erudite analysis of Spinoza's system in the entire extant.
The book employs an extremely sophisticated philosophical language, much which appears to be usages uniquely employed to capture in intricate detail all of the interrelationships or 'potency in act' among Substance, Attribute and the Modalities. This detail allows Hallett to display the complete unity and self-evident truth value in the "Ethics" and related Spinoza writings.
Spinoza's tersely stated propositions, corollaries, demonstrations, definitions and scholia, along with the dearth of illustrations or examples have left many of those lacking in imaginative or expansionary thinking to surmise and explicate much useless commentary. Professor Hallett sets this sorry situation to rights. His work is written for trained students of philosophy, but the intelligent and capable non-philosopher can glean new learnings through diligent study and deep reflection on elegance of Hallett's wisdom and tutelage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9841">'''Henry Johnstone Jr.''' (1920–2000) was an American [[philosopher]] and [[rhetoric]]ian known especially for his notion of the "rhetorical wedge" and his re-evaluation of the ''[[ad hominem]]'' [[fallacy]]. He was Professor of Philosophy at [[Pennsylvania State University]] (1952–1984) and began studying Classics in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="Mifsud2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mifsud |first=Mari Lee |date=January 2000 |title=In memoriam: Henry W. Johnstone, Jr., 1920–2000 |journal=Informal Logic |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=205–206 |doi=10.22329/il.v20i2.2275 |url=http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/article/view/2275}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the founder and longtime editor of the journal ''Philosophy and Rhetoric''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Enos |first=Richard Leo |date=Autumn 2000 |title=Always ... an epitaphios to Henry W. Johnstone, Jr. (1920–2000) |journal=Rhetoric Review |volume=19 |issue=1–2 |pages=6–6 |doi=10.1080/07350190009359273 |jstor=466049}}&lt;/ref&gt; and edited the ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy''.&lt;ref name="Mifsud2000"/&gt;

==Ad hominem==

Ad hominem is Latin for "to the person". According to Johnstone this means arguing from the perspective of the other person one is arguing with, not from one's own perspective. This is not to be confused with the ad hominem fallacy. Ad hominem essentially allows an individual to critique from the inside out, making it easier to show the fallacies or contradictions in the other's argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Snider |first=Alfred |date=25 October 2009 |title=Henry Johnstone and ad hominem argument |url=https://vimeo.com/7247519 |website=vimeo.com |publisher=Video lecture for the class "Argument &amp; Decision" taught by Alfred Snider at the [[University of Vermont]] |accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnstone states that by using ad hominem "the clear mind can exploit the inconsistencies of the confused one. The force of this exploitation is to invite the latter to abandon ambiguity and incoherence."&lt;ref name="Ad hominem"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnstone |first=Henry W. |date=January 1952 |title=Philosophy and argumentum ad hominem |journal=[[The Journal of Philosophy]] |volume=49 |issue=15 |pages=489--498 |doi=10.2307/2021667 |jstor=2021667}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|496}}

==Connection between philosophy and rhetoric==

Early in his career, Johnstone viewed rhetoric as simply a means of deceiving the audience into believing a certain assertion made by the orator.{{cn|date=December 2016}} He viewed philosophy in a more noble and truth-seeking light: "No philosopher worthy of the name would wish to secure assent to his position through techniques concealed from his audience."&lt;ref name="Relevance"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnstone |first=Henry W. |date=February 1966 |title=The relevance of rhetoric to philosophy and of philosophy to rhetoric |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Speech]] |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=41–46 |doi=10.1080/00335636609382756}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43}} He believed that arguments must be tested by the criticism of colleagues, not by concealing the truth: "The philosopher is obligated to tell the truth."&lt;ref name="Relevance"/&gt;{{rp|45}} A few years later, he wrote that "rhetoric is relevant—highly relevant—to philosophy."&lt;ref name="Relevance"/&gt;{{rp|46}} Johnstone held that if man is in fact a persuading and persuadable animal, not merely a communicating one, that not using rhetoric would be similar to treating man as a computer. He stated that it could plausibly be argued that communication is likewise a degenerate form of persuasion—a form in which we report not in order to incite people to action but merely for the sake of reporting.{{cn|date=December 2016}} His argument is that rhetoric is relevant to philosophy because rhetoric is a condition of human existence and that philosophy is a means by which one may be able to clarify that condition.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

==Rhetoric as a wedge==

Johnstone advanced and discussed the notion of rhetoric as "a wedge," in the sense that it serves as a tool to open a gap between the input of data and its acceptance. He wrote: "By 'a wedge', I simply mean whatever introduces such a gap."&lt;ref name="Wedge"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnstone |first=Henry W. |date=Autumn 1990 |title=Rhetoric as a wedge: a reformulation |journal=[[Rhetoric Society Quarterly]] |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=333–338 |doi=10.1080/02773949009390895 |jstor=3885611}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|333}} Rhetoric serves as a wedge, because it helps individuals better understand, rationalize, and make judgments. Therefore, if individuals already knew everything, there would be no need for rhetoric as a means of interpreting data. This process proceeds by a bilateral exchange of responses. Although one may not respond to the orator, one does in one's own mind and perhaps writes a critique.&lt;ref name="Wedge"/&gt;{{rp|336}} Johnstone makes a distinction between rhetoric as a wedge and rhetoric in a degenerate sense in the form of a command or threat. Once rhetoric degenerates to the level of commands or threats, it is no longer bilateral but unilateral, no longer making it a wedge by which one can interpret data.&lt;ref name="Wedge"/&gt;{{rp|335}}

Prior to his death, Johnstone, along with Mari Lee Mifsud, attempted to "supplement the notion of rhetoric as a 'wedge' by suggesting the ways in which it is, and also must be, a 'bridge'."&lt;ref name="Bridge"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnstone |first1=Henry W. |last2=Mifsud |first2=Mari Lee |date=Spring 1999 |title=Wedge and bridge: a note on rhetoric as distinction and as identification |journal=[[Rhetoric Society Quarterly]] |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=75–78 |doi=10.1080/02773949909391145 |jstor=3886087}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|75}} They state that rhetoric serves as a wedge in deliberative and forensic speech, but not in epideictic. Mentioning Aristotle's advice that when the audience and speaker are already aligned in terms of a particular consciousness, the speaker need only to amplify and celebrate this consciousness, they conclude: "While this celebration is not a wedge, since it calls attention to nothing the audience did not already believe, it is a bridge."&lt;ref name="Bridge"/&gt;{{rp|76}}

==Impact==

Johnstone's discussion of rhetorical and dialectical argument was viewed as being highly original, and at odds with the prevailing [[logical empiricism]] of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walton |first=Douglas N. |authorlink=Doug Walton |date=January 2001 |title=Johnstone's view of rhetorical and dialectical argument |journal=Informal Logic |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=51–60 |doi=10.22329/il.v21i1.2235 |url=http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/article/view/2235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars in both the fields of philosophy and rhetoric attribute to Johnstone significant advances in [[argumentation]]:&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the issue of the journal ''Informal Logic'' posthumously dedicated to Johnstone's work: {{cite journal |date=January 2001 |title=Special issue in honour of Henry W. Johnstone, Jr. |journal=Informal Logic |volume=21 |issue=1 |url=http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/issue/view/273 |doi=10.22329/il.v21i1.2233}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Johnstone's focus on the transaction of arguing had an immediate impact within the U.S. argumentation and debate community, directing attention to the normative aspects of controversy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goodwin |first=Jean |date=January 2001 |title=Henry Johnstone, Jr.'s still-unacknowledged contributions to contemporary argumentation theory |journal=Informal Logic |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=41–50 |doi=10.22329/il.v21i1.2234 |url=http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/article/view/2234}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}} His extensive work on ad hominem argumentation provoked a serious reexamination among philosophers. Many accredit him for adequately showing that ad hominem argumentation was quite typical surrounding philosophical writings, and had much broader use than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Walton |first=Douglas N. |authorlink=Doug Walton |date=2001 |chapter=Ad hominem argument |editor-last=Sloane |editor-first=Thomas O. |title=Encyclopedia of rhetoric |location=Oxford; New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |pages=1–4 |isbn=0195125959 |oclc=45282993 |doi=10.1093/acref/9780195125955.001.0001 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=eslMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8114">[[File:DE Büdingen Herrnhaag 1835 1.jpg|thumb|Herrnhaag as it looked in 1750.]]

'''Herrnhaag''' (Lord's Grove) was a communal spiritual centre for the [[Moravian Church|Moravian Unity]], an early form of Protestantism. It and Marienborn, a nearby sister community, are located in the [[Wetterau]], an area of [[Hesse]], north of [[Frankfurt am Main]] in [[Germany]].

== Spiritual purpose as the home of Christ ==
“Herrnhaag was designed to express the Moravian ideal before it was built” &lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Arthur. (1998) ''An Ecumenical Theology of the Heart: The Theology of Count Nicolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf. Bethlehem: The Moravian Church in America''. pp 271. {{ISBN|978-1-878422-38-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served a unique purpose: it was planned as the House of God. There were to be twelve gates following the description of New Jerusalem in Revelation. In the center was the well of the water of life also recalling Revelation: “Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city” (Revelation 22:1).

According to church leader [[Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf|Nicolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf]], who planned the community, the Moravian Unity anticipated “the end time when the heavenly reality would become the total reality.”&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Living in that end time was the purpose of Herrnhaag, which was designed to be the residence of Christ. According to Zinzendorf, “We have [the Holy Spirit’s] care to thank for the fact that we are brought here together, that we dwell in a Mother-city.”&lt;ref&gt;Atwood, Craig D. (1995) Blood, Sex, and Death: Life and Liturgy in Zinzendorf’s Bethlehem, Ph.D. diss., Princeton Theological Seminary. pp.33.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation and organization as a community living in Christ ==
[[File:Marienborn compressed.jpg|thumb|Marienborn as it looked in the mid-18th century.]]
During exile from the family estates in [[Saxony]], Zinzendorf began negotiating for Marienborn as a residence for what was called the Pilgrim Congregation. Before it was available, he brought his family to stay at the [[Ronneburg, Hesse|Ronneburg]], a dilapidated castle in the area. Eventually the Zinzendorfs moved into Marienborn and construction of Herrnhaag began in 1738. The community was unfinished at the time of its abandonment in the early 1750s.

Community members lived under the direct rule of Christ as the community’s chief elder and shepherd. Herrnhaag was the church’s fastest growing settlement and the one most criticized for heresy.

The community’s focal point was the great hall, the Saal, the place of ritual and worship. The Saal was built on two levels, with a balcony overlooking the main floor, representing earthly reality below and the heaven reality above. The festivals held in the Saal provided a multimedia effect on worshippers resulting from the combination of illuminations, music, ritual, paintings and pageantry. 
[[File:Herrnhaag saal compressed.jpg|thumb|The Saal or hall, scene of festivals and religious ceremonies.]]

The cantata written for the dedication of Herrnhaag’s Single Brethren’s House in 1739 shows how community residents looked upon their lives as dedicated to Christ “You know how much we cherish you, most magnificent of all gifts! Precious offering of grace from above! Bless the sacred marriage. Bless the sacred virginity . . . the young men’s strength will be gathered for knighthood in your service . . . This house shall become, and those that live therein, your glorification here on earth!”&lt;ref&gt;Erbe, Hans-Walter. (1982) “Die Herrnhaag-Kantate von 1739,” 11, Unitas Fratrum: 11. pp. 29-34. Translation by Edward Quinter.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other Moravian communities, living arrangements were based on the separation of members according to age, marital status and gender into so-called choirs. Each choir had its own festivals. The festival of the Single Brothers at Herrnhaag in 1748 included the glorification of Christ's sidehole wound, considered sacred because it represented Christ's compassionate, sacrificing love. Christian Renatus von Zinzendorf, Nicolaus Ludwig's son, led the ceremony making it clear that he literally had become the sidehole of Christ and when he embraced the men, they were embraced by the sidehole.&lt;ref&gt;Peucker, Paul. (2006) “Inspired by Flames of Love”: Homosexuality, Mysticism and Moravian Brothers around 1750, ''Journal of the History of Sexuality''. 15(1):48.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a pictorial representation of the sidehole large enough that each man could enter and pass through it. In this way the men understood they were becoming one with Christ.

== Scandal, dispersal and abandonment ==
What was condemned as heretical by many towards events at Herrnhaag was the blending of the sexual and the spiritual, the human and the divine. Based on writings of Christian Zinzendorf proclaiming all souls to be female, the brothers were proclaimed by Christian Renatus to actually be female and therefore eligible to be brides of Christ who could be entered and filled. There is some evidence that they practiced this literally among themselves and perhaps between the genders as well, though one should be careful to make conclusions, as the times of Count Zinzendorf were immersed in slander and defamatory libels, of whose it is difficult to ascertain truth and false (a famous example is Voltaire's "Vie privée du roi de Prusse"). Original sources should be a primary source of citation (not given underneath).

Many within and without the church were scandalized by rumors of such behavior and Ludwig von Zinzendorf finally decided to take action, threatening to whip those involved.&lt;ref&gt;Hergemöller, Bernd-Ulrich. (1999) "Nikolaus Ludwig von and Christian Renatus von Zinzendorf," in: ''Mann für Mann: biographisches Lexikon zur Geschichte von Freundesliebe und mannmännlicher Sexualität im deutschen Sprachraum'', Hamburg: [[Männerschwarm]]. pp 765, {{ISBN|3-928983-65-2}}. Translated by Hilke Kuhlmann.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian and others were called to [[Lindsey House]] outside London where Nicholas was living. 

The residents of Herrnhaag began dispersing after this. In addition to the bad publicity, Herrnhaag and its festivals were a financial drain on the church. But the decision to actually close the settlement was the result of the new local ruler, Gustav Friedrich Count of Ysenburg-Büdingen, who demanded that the Moravians abjure Nicolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf and swear fealty only to himself. Every one of the residents refused to comply, and began to emigrate in 1750, and the community was abandoned by 1753.

== Modern Moravian community ==
[[File:Buedingen Herrnhaag 1.jpg|thumb|The Sisters' House to the left and the Lichtenburg on the right.]]
In the latter twentieth-century Herrnhaag was resettled as a Moravian commune and restoration work was begun on the Lichtenburg, the "Fortress of Light", containing the Saal worship hall and the rooms where Count Nicolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf had lived, and the Sisters' House. As of 2009, other buildings are privately owned such as the Single Brethren's House, where Christian Renatus lived, which is now a farm house. The community well remains in the center of the property.

'''''Hunminjeongeum''''' (lit. ''The Correct/Proper Sounds for the Instruction of the People'') is a document describing an entirely new and native [[writing system|script]] for the [[Korean language]].  The script was initially named after the publication, but later came to be known as [[hangul]]. It was created so that the common people illiterate in [[hanja]] could accurately and easily read and write the Korean language. It was announced in Volume 102 of the ''Annals of King Sejong'', and its formal supposed publication date, October 9, 1446, is now [[Hangul Day]] in South Korea. The Annals place its invention to the 25th year of Sejong's reign, corresponding to 1443–1444.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Iksop|title=The Korean language|year=2000|publisher=State Univ. of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=0791448312|pages=31–32|author2=Ramsey, S. Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The publication is written in [[Classical Chinese]] and contains a preface, the alphabet letters ''(jamo),'' and brief descriptions of their corresponding sounds. It is later supplemented by a longer document called ''[[Hunminjeongeum Haerye]]'' that is designated as a national treasure No. 70. To distinguish it from its supplement, ''Hunminjeongeum'' is sometimes called the "Samples and Significance Edition of ''Hunminjeongeum''" ({{lang|ko|훈민정음예의본; 訓民正音例義本}}).

The Classical Chinese (漢文/hanmun) of the ''Hunminjeongeum'' has been partly translated into Middle Korean. This translation is found together with ''Worinseokbo,'' and is called the ''Hunminjeongeum Eonhaebon''.

The first paragraph of the document reveals [[Sejong the Great|King Sejong]]'s motivation for creating hangul:
*[[Classical Chinese]] (Original):
:&lt;big&gt;{{lang|zh|國之語音&lt;br&gt;異乎中國&lt;br&gt;與文字不相流通&lt;br&gt;故愚民 有所欲言&lt;br&gt;而終不得伸其情者多矣&lt;br&gt;予爲此憫然&lt;br&gt;新制二十八字&lt;br&gt;欲使人人易習便於日用"耳"(矣)}}&lt;/big&gt;
*Mix of [[hanja]] (Chinese characters) and Hangul (Eonhaebon):&lt;ref name="eonhaebon" /&gt;
:[[Image:Hunmin Jeongeum mixed.svg]]
*Rendered into written Korean (Eonhaebon):&lt;ref name="eonhaebon"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faq.ktug.or.kr/wiki/uploads/hunmin.uni|title=Hunminjeongeum Eonhaebon|accessdate=July 14, 2006|author=KTUG.or.kr}} Linked from KTUG's [http://faq.ktug.or.kr/faq/HanyangPuaTableProject Hanyang PUA Table Project]. Based on data from [http://www.sejong.or.kr/ The 21st Century Sejong Project]&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[Image:Hunmin Jeongeum.svg]]
*Translation (metaphrase):{{quote|Because the speech of this country is different from that of China, it [the spoken language] does not match the [Chinese] letters. Therefore, even if the ignorant want to communicate, many of them in the end cannot state their concerns. Saddened by this, I have [had] 28 letters newly made. It is my wish that all the people may easily learn these letters and that [they] be convenient for daily use.}}
*Translation (paraphrase):{{quote|The language of [our] people is different from that of the nation of China and thus cannot be expressed by the written language of Chinese people. Because of this reason, the cries of illiterate peasants are not properly understood by the many [in the position of privilege]. I [feel the plight of the peasants and the difficulties faced by the public servants and] am saddened by the situation.&lt;p&gt;Therefore, twenty eight [written] characters have been newly created. [My desire is] such that, each [Korean] person may become familiar [with the newly created written language of Korean] and use them daily in an intuitive way.

** The one included in ''Sejongsillok'' (세종실록; 世宗實錄; "''The [[Sejong]] Chronicles''"), Volume 113.
* The ''Eonhaebon'', 36 pages, extensively annotated in hangul, with all hanja transcribed with small hangul to their lower right. The Hangul were written in both ink-brush and geometric styles. Four copies are left:
** At the beginning of ''Worinseokbo'' (월인석보; 月印釋譜), an annotated [[Buddhist]] scripture
** One preserved by Park Seungbin
** One preserved by Kanazawa, a Japanese person

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20330">'''Ignatian spirituality''', also known as '''Jesuit spirituality''', is a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[spirituality]] founded on the experiences of the sixteenth-century [[Theology|theologian]] [[Ignatius of Loyola]], founder of the [[Jesuit order]]. The main idea of this form of spirituality comes from Ignatius's ''[[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]]'', the aim of which is to help one "conquer oneself and to regulate one's life in such a way that no decision is made under the influence of any inordinate attachment." The ''Exercises'' are intended to give the person undertaking them a greater degree of freedom from his or her own likes and dislikes, that they may choose based solely on what they discern God's will is for them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bustedhalo.com/questionbox/what-does-st-ignatius-mean-when-he-calls-us-to-indifference ''Busted Halo''.

==Development==
[[File:LaMorenetaVirginOfMontserrat.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Upon his recovery from battle wounds, St. [[Ignatius of Loyola]] hung his military accoutrements before the image of the [[Virgin of Montserrat]].]]
After recovering from a leg wound incurred during the [[List of battles of the Italian Wars#Pampeluna|Siege of Pamplona]] in 1521, Ignatius made a retreat with the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictines]] of [[Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey|Montserrat]]. They introduced him to the "Ejercitatoria de la vida espiritual" of Garcia de Cisneros, based in large part on the teachings of the [[Brothers of the Common Life]], promoters of the "[[devotio moderna]]." From there, he spent ten months at [[Manresa]], where he discovered ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'' of [[Thomas à Kempis]].&lt;ref name=Pinard/&gt; Parts of the ''Exercises'' were completed later while he was a student in Paris.

==General principles==
Ignatian spirituality has been described as a spirituality of finding [[God's will]] for better decision making.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ignatianspirituality.com/making-good-decisions/an-approach-to-good-choices/an-ignatian-framework-for-making-a-decision/ Manney, Jim. "An Ignatian Framework for Making a Decision", Ignation Spirituality, Loyala Press]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], "choice" is the center of the ''Exercises''.&lt;ref name=Schindler&gt; Löser S.J., Werner.  "The Ignatian ''Exercises'' in the Work of Hans Urs von Balthasar", ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=QTK8zhja1v4C&amp;pg=PT64 Hans Urs Von Balthasar: His Life and Work]'', (David L. Schindler, ed.) Ignatius Press, 1991, {{ISBN|9780898703788}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their original objective was the question of the choice of a state of life.&lt;ref name=Pinard/&gt;

The Ignatian process of making good decisions acknowledges that decisions are often between two goods, understanding that the better good, or "the more" (lat. ''magis''), is what we instinctively want, and what God wants for us. "In all things, to love and to serve" (Spanish: ''en todo amar y servir'') was a motto of St Ignatius, who wanted to "be like [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]] and [[Saint Dominic|St. Dominic]]", though better.&lt;ref name=john/&gt;{{rp|24  }}

==Aspects of Ignatian spirituality==
Ignatian spirituality has the following characteristics:&lt;ref name=Pinard&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/SPIRIT/IGNASPIR.TXT De La Boullaye, Pinard. ''Ignatian Spirituality''].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Ad maiorem Dei gloriam|God's greater glory]]:''' St Ignatius of Loyola—"a man who gave the first place of his life to God" said [[Benedict XVI]]—stressed that "Man is created to praise, reverence, and serve God Our Lord and by this means to save his soul." This is the "First Principle and Foundation" of the ''Exercises''. Ignatius declares: "The goal of our life is to live with God forever. God who loves us, gave us life. Our own response of love allows God's life to flow into us without limit.... Our only desire and our one choice should be this: I want and I choose what better leads to the deepening of God's life in me."

'''Union with [[Jesus]]:''' Ignatius emphasized an ardent love for the Saviour. In his month-long ''Exercises'', he devoted the last three weeks to the contemplation of Jesus: from infancy and public ministry, to his passion, and lastly his risen life. To achieve empathy with Jesus and a closer following of him, Ignatius proposed a form of contemplation that he called  "application of the senses" to the scenes in the life of Jesus.&lt;ref name="spirex" /&gt;{{rp|121ff}} The ''Spiritual Exercises'', in 104, sum this up in a prayer that I may "love him more and follow him more closely." There is a considerable emphasis on the emotions in Ignatius' methods, and a call for one to be sensitive to emotional movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://areyouaware.wordpress.com/2008/08/23|title=23 {{!}} August {{!}} 2008 {{!}} Are You Aware?|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-awareness:''' Ignatius recommends the twice-daily ''examen'' (examination). This is a guided method of prayerfully reviewing the events of the day, to awaken one's inner sensitivity to one's ''own'' actions, desires, and spiritual state, through each moment reviewed. The goals are to see where God is challenging the person to change and to growth, where God is calling the person to deeper reflection (especially apt when discerning if one has a Jesuit vocation in life), to where sinful or imperfect attitudes or blind spots are found. The general ''examen'', often at the end of the day, is, as the name implies, a general review. The particular ''examen'', often in the middle of the day, focuses on a particular fault—identified by the person—to be worked upon in the course of some days or weeks. Since the 1970s there have been numerous in-depth studies and adaptations of the examen to contemporary needs. This is explained below under the title "Examen of Consciousness."&lt;ref name="examen"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ignatianspirituality.com/ignatian-prayer/the-examen|title=The Daily Examen - IgnatianSpirituality.com|work=Ignatian Spirituality|access-date=2017-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Spiritual direction]]:''' Meditation and contemplation, and for instance the aforementioned examen, are best guided, Ignatius says, by an experienced person. Jesuits, and those following Ignatian spirituality, meet with their spiritual director (traditionally a priest, though in recent years many laypersons have undertaken this role) on a regular basis (weekly or monthly) to discuss the fruits of their prayer life and be offered guidance. Ignatius sees the director as someone who can rein in impulsiveness or excesses, goad the complacent, and keep people honest with themselves. But the director should not so much explain but simply present the exercises, to not get in the way of God who "communicates himself with the well-disposed person."&lt;ref name="spirex" /&gt;{{rp|2,15}} If the director is a priest, spiritual direction may or may not be connected with the Sacrament of Reconciliation.&lt;!--Ignatius counseled frequent use of sacrament and while some directors see them as integrally linked, others hold them to be two separate relationships.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}--&gt;

'''Effective love:''' The founder of the Society of Jesus emphasized effective love (love shown in deeds) over affective love (love based on feelings). He usually ended his most important letters with "I implore God to grant us all the grace to know His holy will and to accomplish it perfectly." This love which leads us to a perfect correspondence with God's will demands self-sacrifice—renunciation of personal feelings and preferences. This is expressed in Ignatius' prayer in the last exercise of his ''Spiritual Exercises'', which remains popular among Jesuits: "Take Lord and receive, all my liberty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Maureen Ward|title=Take Lord Receive by John Foley S.J.|date=2013-04-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ngqSG0RMWM|accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Detachment:''' Where [[Francis of Assisi]]'s concept of poverty emphasized the spiritual benefits of simplicity and dependency, Ignatius emphasized detachment, or "indifference." This figures prominently into what Ignatius called the "First Principle and Foundation" of the ''Exercises''.&lt;ref name="spirex" /&gt;{{rp|23}} For Ignatius, whether one was rich or poor, healthy or sick, in an assignment one enjoyed or one didn't, was comfortable in a culture or not, etc., should be a matter of spiritual indifference—a modern phrasing might put it as serene acceptance. Hence, a Jesuit (or one following Ignatian spirituality) placed in a comfortable, wealthy neighborhood should continue to live the Gospel life without anxiety or possessiveness, and if plucked from that situation to be placed in a poor area and subjected to hardships should with a sense of spiritual joy accept that as well, looking only to do God's will.

'''Prayer and efforts at self-conquest:''' Ignatius's book The ''Spiritual Exercises'' is a fruit of months of [[prayer]].&lt;ref name=john&gt;O'Malley, John W. ''The First Jesuits'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard, 1993. {{ISBN|978-0674303133}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}} Prayer, In Ignatian spirituality, is fundamental since it was at the foundation of Jesus' life, but it does not dispense from "helping oneself", a phrase frequently used by Ignatius. Thus, he also speaks of [[mortification (theology)|mortification]] and of amendment.

'''Devotion to the Sacred Heart, the Eucharist, and Our Lady:''' The Society of Jesus has a relationship with the [[Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary]] in a commitment to spread the devotion to the [[Sacred Heart]]. Though the concept of devotion to Christ's mercy, as symbolized in the image of the Sacred Heart, goes further back, its modern origins can be traced to St. [[Marie Alacoque]], a Visitation nun, whose spiritual director was the Jesuit St. [[Claude de la Colombière]]. The Jesuits promoted this devotion to emphasize the compassion and overwhelming love of Christ for people, and to counteract the rigorism and spiritual pessimism of the [[Jansenists]].

St. Ignatius counselled people to receive the [[Eucharist]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ic bread more often, and from the order's earliest days the Jesuits were promoters of "frequent communion". It should be noted that it was the custom for many Catholics at that time to receive Holy Communion perhaps once or twice a year, out of what Catholic theologians considered an exaggerated respect for the sacrament. Ignatius and others advocated receiving the sacrament even weekly,&lt;ref name="spirex" /&gt;{{rp|18}} emphasizing Holy Communion not as reward but as spiritual food. By the time of Pope St. [[Pius X]] (1903–1914), "frequent communion" had come to mean weekly, even daily reception.

Ignatius made his initial commitment to a new way of life by leaving his soldier's weapons (and symbolically, his old values) on an altar before an image of the Christ child seated on the lap of [[Our Lady of Montserrat]]. Also, the Jesuits were long promoters of the [[Sodality of Our Lady]], their primary organization for their students until the 1960s, which they used to encourage frequent attendance at Mass, reception of Communion, recitation of the [[Rosary]], and attendance at retreats in the Ignatian tradition of the ''Spiritual Exercises''. Since the [[Second Vatican Council]], Marian Sodalities have been largely replaced by small [[Sodality of Our Lady#Post-Vatican II and the advent of the Christian Life Communities|Christian Life Community]] (CLC) cells which emphasize the [[Justice in the World|service of justice]] thrust that grew in the Catholic church after [[Vatican II]]. The [[Christian Life Community|CLC]] secretariat is at the Jesuit headquarters in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cvx-clc.net/l-en/secretariat.php|title=CLC World Secretariat|website=www.cvx-clc.net|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zeal for souls:''' The purpose of the Society of Jesus, says the ''Summary of the Constitutions'', is "not only to apply one's self to one's own salvation and to perfection with the help of divine grace, but to employ all one's strength for the salvation and perfection of one's neighbor."

'''Finding God in All Things:''' The vision that Ignatius places at the beginning of the ''Exercises'' keeps sight of both the Creator and the creature, the One and the other swept along in the same movement of love. In it, God offers himself to humankind in an absolute way through the Son, and humankind responds in an absolute way by a total self-donation. There is no longer sacred or profane, natural or supernatural, mortification or prayer—because it is one and the same Spirit who brings it about that the Christian will see and "love God in all things—and all things in God."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ignatianspirituality.com/what-is-ignatian-spirituality/god-in-all-things-video|title=God in All Things Video - IgnatianSpirituality.com|work=Ignatian Spirituality|access-date=2017-03-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Jesuits have always been active in the graphic and dramatic arts, literature, and the [[List of Jesuit scientists|sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://publications.ias.edu/sites/default/files/Lavin_BerniniImageIdealChristianMonarch_1999.pdf|title=The Jesuits: Cultures, Sciences, and the Arts, 1540-1773|last=O'Malley et al.|first=John W.|publisher=University of Toronto|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Examen of Consciousness:''' The Examen of Consciousness is a simple prayer directed toward developing a spiritual sensitivity to the special ways God approaches, invites, and calls. Ignatius recommends that the examen be done at least twice, and suggests five points of prayer:
* Recalling that one is in the presence of God
* Thanking God for all the blessings one has received
* Examining how one has lived the day
* Asking God for forgiveness
* Resolution and offering a prayer of hopeful recommitment

It is important, however, that the person feels free to structure the Examen in a way that is personally most helpful. There is no right way to do it; nor is there a need to go through all of the five points each time. A person might, for instance, find oneself spending the entire time on only one or two points. The basic rule is: Go wherever God draws you. And this touches upon an important point: the Examen of Consciousness is primarily a time of prayer; it is a "being with God." It focuses on one's consciousness of God, not necessarily one's conscience regarding sins and mistakes.&lt;ref name=examen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ignatianspirituality.com/ignatian-prayer/the-examen/consciousness-examen|title=Consciousness Examen by George Aschenbrenner, SJ - IgnatianSpirituality.com|work=Ignatian Spirituality|access-date=2017-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Discernment:''' Discernment is rooted in the understanding that God is ever at work in one's life, "inviting, directing, guiding, and drawing" one "into the fullness of life." Its central action is reflection on the ordinary events of one's life. It presupposes an ability to reflect, a habit of personal prayer, self-knowledge, knowledge of one's deepest desires, and openness to God's direction and guidance. Discernment is a prayerful "pondering" or "mulling over" the choices a person wishes to consider. In discernment, the person's focus should be on a quiet attentiveness to God and sensing rather than thinking. The goal is to understand the choices in one's heart, to see them, as it were, as God might see them. In one sense, there is no limit to how long one might wish to continue in this. Discernment is a repetitive process, yet as the person continues some choices {{not a typo|shoul|d of}} their own accord fall by the wayside while others should gain clarity and focus. It is a process that should move inexorably toward a decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ignatianspirituality.com/making-good-decisions/discernment-of-spirits|title=Discernment of Spirits - IgnatianSpirituality.com|work=Ignatian Spirituality|access-date=2017-03-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Service and humility:''' Ignatius emphasized the active expression of God's love in life and the need to be self-forgetful in humility. Part of Jesuit formation is the undertaking of service specifically to the poor and sick in the most humble ways: Ignatius wanted Jesuits in training to serve part of their time as [[Novice|novices]] and in [[tertianship]] as the equivalent of orderlies in hospitals, for instance emptying bed pans and washing patients, to learn humility and loving service. Jesuit educational institutions often adopt mottoes and mission statements that include the idea of making students "men and women for others",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onlineministries.creighton.edu/CollaborativeMinistry/men-for-others.html|title=Men for Others|website=onlineministries.creighton.edu|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the like. Jesuit missions have generally included medical clinics, schools, and agricultural development projects as ways to serve the poor or needy while preaching the Gospel.

Some groups who find the Ignatian "way of proceeding" helpful include the [[Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus]] (RSCJ), the [[Faithful Companions of Jesus]] (FCJ), the [[Loreto Sisters]] (IBVM), the [[Religious Sisters of Charity]] (RSC), the [[Oblates of the Virgin Mary]], and the [[Christian life community|Christian Life Communities]] (CLC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/PRIESTS/socjesus.htm EWTN on Ignatian influence. Accessed 2 November 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Spiritual Exercises'' ===
{{See also| Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola}} 
According to St Ignatius, the purpose of the ''Exercises'' is "to conquer oneself and to regulate one's life in such a way that no decision is made under the influence of any inordinate attachment."&lt;ref name="spirex" /&gt; In other words, the ''Exercises'' are intended, in Ignatius' view, to give the exercitant (the person undertaking them) a greater degree of freedom from his or her own likes, dislikes, comforts, wants, needs, drives, appetites, and passions that they may choose based solely on what they discern God's will is for them. [[Peter Hans Kolvenbach]], while Superior General of the Jesuits, said that the ''Exercises'' "try to unite two apparently incompatible realities: ''exercises ''and ''spiritual.''" It invites to "unlimited generosity" in [[Christian contemplation#Acquired contemplation|contemplating]] God, yet going down to the level of many details.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjweb.info/spirituality/2003consult_frgen_show.cfm Discourse given to the Rome Consultation, 16 February 2003].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}

'''Indefinite Monism''' is a philosophical conception of [[reality]] that asserts that only [[Awareness]] is real and that the wholeness of [[Reality]] can be conceptually thought of in terms of [[immanent]] and [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] aspects.  The immanent aspect is denominated simply as [[Awareness]], while the [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] aspect is  referred to as ''Omnific Awareness''.  

[[Awareness]] in this system is not equivalent to [[consciousness]].  Rather, Awareness is the venue for consciousness, and the transcendent aspect of [[Reality]], ''Omnific Awareness'', is what [[consciousness]] is of.  

In this system, what is real is distinguished from that which exists by showing that everything that we are conscious of exists but is not real since it is contingent upon awareness for its existence.  Awareness is the source of its own energetic display -- its omneity.  Rather than leading to a solipsistic account of reality, it is claimed through an analysis of consciousness that it is an error on our part to conceive of individuated awareness.  That error being found in a conflation of the objects of consciousness with the subject of consciousness within an assumed form of reality of separate physical things.  Proceeding from the one [[logical truth|necessarily true]] and unquestionable fact – that we are present to our experiences – an understanding of reality is developed that is neither a [[materialist]] nor an [[idealist]] conceptualization.  This way of viewing the world is referred to as [[surjective]], a metaphorical use of a concept found in mathematical set theory that means a function that works upon every member of a set, where Awareness is the function and ''Omnific Awareness'' is the set, in order to distinguish this position from both subjectivity and objectivity.

Within this system anything whatsoever can arise from ''Omnific Awareness'', thus the use of the term “indefinite” in labeling this monism.  What does arise as the existents that we are conscious of is conditioned by the affections of Awareness for its display.  Thus this system does away with the idea of an active, creative force called Free Will and replaces it with an active volitional component known as affections, that does not itself create anything, whether movement or structure, but instead, constrains the possibilities of what arises naturally.  Arguably, the concept of [[Free Will]] necessitates a world of separation as it implies an actor and that which is acted upon.  In this conception there is no such separation.  Yet our intuitive modeling of the existents of reality as arising from natural processes, as well as our intuitive understanding that we can ‘cause’ things to happen by our ‘will’, are both cleanly supported.

The distinction between physical phenomena and mental phenomena is also removed by this system.  ''Omnific Awareness'' gives rise to everything – thus the use of the term ''omnific'' – and this includes thoughts that phenomenally arise in brains as well as existents that arise phenomenally as things in the world.  By removing this distinction this system cuts off the inevitable paradoxes that otherwise arise in philosophical systems.  The implications of this move create a number of novel, but necessary, modifications in current categorizations of ideas about reality and our study of it.  For instance, [[ontology]] – the study of being – is necessitated by the assumption of a physical world of separate things, but when viewed surjectively ontology collapses into [[epistemology]] – the study of the methods or grounds of knowledge.  Similarly, by removing the distinction between mental and physical phenomena the tensions created in dualist understandings of reality of how the mental and physical interact with one another are dispelled.  Surprisingly, the removal of this distinction also completely removes the need for claims of metaphysical realms of being or metaphysical processes, thus collapsing all of reality into this reality.

The implications of this view of Reality are carried as far as [[ethics]], where the lack of separation between Awareness and that which it gives rise to necessitate a far-reaching adjustment in our ethical beliefs.  One such difference that is highlighted for instance is that all conscious beings, which are called “knowings” in deference to this new conception of reality, are qualitatively the same; thus our current distinction between “human beings” and “animals” is based upon a [[false dichotomy]], and this new understanding will necessitate an adjustment in our ideas of who or what can be “property” and who or what can be a “person.”

[[File:Frauenberg 030.jpg|thumb|[[Fresco]] of the Judgment of Solomon, {{Interlanguage link multi|Wallfahrtskirche Frauenberg|de}} [[Frauenberg, Styria]]]]

The '''Judgment of Solomon''' is a story from the [[Hebrew Bible]] in which [[Solomon|King Solomon of Israel]] ruled between two women both claiming to be the mother of a child. Solomon revealed their true feelings and relationship to the child by suggesting to cut the baby in two, with each woman to receive half. With this strategy,  he was able to discern the non-mother as the woman who entirely approved of this proposal, while the actual mother begged that the sword might be sheathed and the child committed to the care of her rival. Some consider this approach to justice an [[archetype|archetypal]] example of an impartial judge displaying wisdom in making a ruling.

==Biblical narrative==
[[File:Giorgione Salomone.jpg|thumb|''[[The Judgement of Solomon (Giorgione)|The Judgement of Solomon]]'' (School of [[Giorgione]], 1500)]]

{{bibleverse|1|Kings|3:16–28|HE}} recounts that two mothers living in the same house, each the mother of an infant son, came to Solomon. One of the babies [[Overlaying|had been smothered]], and each claimed the remaining boy as her own. Calling for a sword, Solomon declared his judgment: the baby would be cut in two, each woman to receive half. One mother did not contest the ruling, declaring that if she could not have the baby then neither of them could, but the other begged Solomon, "Give the baby to her, just don't kill him!"

The king declared the second woman the true mother, as a mother would even give up her baby if that was necessary to save its life. This judgment became known throughout all of Israel and was considered an example of profound wisdom.

==Classification and parallels==
The story is commonly viewed in scholarship as an instance or a reworking of a [[Folklore|folktale]]. Its folkloristic nature is apparent, among other things, in the dominance of [[direct speech]] which moves the plot on and contributes to the [[characterization]].&lt;ref name="Mordechai Cogan 2001, p. 196"&gt;Mordechai Cogan, ''I Kings'' (Anchor Bible), New York: Doubleday, 2001, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; The story is classified as [[Aarne-Thompson]] tale type 926, and many parallel stories have been found in world [[folklore]]. In Uther's edition of the Aarne-Thompson index,&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Jörg Uther, ''The Types of International Folktales: A Classification and Bibliography, Based on the System of Antii Aarne and Stith Thompson'', I, Helsinki: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; this tale type is classified as a [[Novella (folklore)|folk novella]], and belongs to a subgroup designated: "Clever Acts and Words". Eli Yassif defines the folk novella as "a realistic story whose time and place are determined&amp;nbsp;... The novella emphasizes such human traits as cleverness, eroticism, loyalty, and wiliness, that drive the plot forward more than any other element".&lt;ref&gt;Eli Yassif, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LbZPv-2LO6YC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Hebrew Folktale: History, Genre, Meaning''] (Folklore Studies in Translation), Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1999, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hugo Gressmann]] has found 22 similar stories in world folklore and literature, especially in India and the far east.&lt;ref&gt;See Hugo Gressmann, [https://archive.org/stream/deutscherundsch130stutuoft#page/212/mode/2up "Das salomonische Urteil"], ''Deutsche Rundschau'' 130 (1907), pp. 212–28&lt;/ref&gt; One Indian version is a [[Jataka]] story dealing with [[Buddha]] in one of his previous incarnations as the sage Mahosadha, who arbitrates between a mother and a [[Yakshini]] who is in the shape of a woman, who kidnapped the mother's baby and claimed he was hers. The sage announced a [[tug war]]: He drew a line on the ground and asked the two to stand on opposite sides of the line, one holding his feet and the other his hands – The one who would pull the baby's whole body beyond the line would get him. The mother, seeing how the baby suffers, released him and let the Yakshini take him, weeping. When the sage saw that, he turned the baby back to the hands of the true mother, exposed the identity of the Yakshini and expelled her.&lt;ref&gt;See E. B. Cowell (ed.), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/j6/j6012.htm#page_163 ''The Jātaka, or Stories of the Buddha's Former Births''], VI, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1907, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; In other Indian versions the two women are widows of one husband.&lt;ref&gt;See for example G.

Frazer's Folklore in the Old Testament'', II, New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1969, p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt; which has been widespread all over the world and many versions and reworkings were made after it, among them [[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]], a play by [[Bertolt Brecht]].

The common motif in those different parallels is that the wise judge announces an absurd procedure, which is reasonable in some perverse way: Splitting the baby, according to the principle of compromise; Or a tug war, in which one can possibly assume that the true mother will be motivated to pull harder. But this procedure is actually a concealed emotional test, designed to force each woman to decide whether her compassion to the baby overpowers her will to win.&lt;ref name="William Hansen 2002, p. 228"&gt;William Hansen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ezDlXl7gP9oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA228#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature''], Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2002, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is indirect evidence that the story was widespread in ancient times in the western world too. A Greek [[papyrus]] fragment, dating from the beginning of the second century AD, includes a fragmented reference to an ancient legal case which is similar to the judgment of Solomon. The writer ascribes the story to Phliliskos of [[Miletos]], living in the fourth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;William Hansen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ezDlXl7gP9oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA229#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature''], Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2002, pp. 229–30.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[fresco]] found in the "House of the Physician" in [[Pompeii]] depicts [[pygmies]] introducing a scene similar to the biblical story.&lt;ref name="Hansen: fresco"&gt;William Hansen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ezDlXl7gP9oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA231#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature''], Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2002, pp. 231–32. [http://www.flickriver.com/photos/16472880@N06/2218609158/ A picture of the fresco].&lt;/ref&gt; Some think that the fresco relates directly to the biblical story,&lt;ref&gt;Frederick E. Brenk, "Greek, Greeks; C. Religion", ''Encyclopedia of the Bible and its Reception'', v. 10, 2015, p. 889.&lt;/ref&gt; while according to others it represents a parallel tradition.&lt;ref name="Hansen: fresco" /&gt;

Several suggestions for the genre of the biblical story have been raised, beyond its characterization as a folktale of a known type. [[Edward Lipinski (orientalist)|Edward Lipinski]] suggests that the story is an example of "king's bench tales", a subgenre of the [[wisdom literature]] to which he finds parallels in [[Sumerian literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lipinski, "Ancient Types of Wisdom Literature in Biblical Narrative", in Alexander Rofé and Yair Zakovitch (eds.), ''Isac Leo Seeligmann Volume'', Jerusalem: E. Rubenstein, 1983, pp. 51–55&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have pointed out that the story resembles the modern [[Detective fiction|detective story]] genre. Both king Solomon and the reader are confronted with some kind of a juridical-detective riddle. [[Meir Sternberg]] notes that two genres merge in the story: A riddle and a test; The juridical dilemma, which is the riddle, also constitutes a test for the young king: If he will solve it he will be acknowledged to possess divine wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Meir Sternberg, ''The Poetics of Biblical Narrative: Ideological Literature and the Drama of Reading'' (Indiana Studies in Biblical Literature), Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1985, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart Lasine classifies the story as a law-court riddle.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Lasine, "The Riddle of Solomon’s Judgment and the Riddle of Human Nature in the Hebrew Bible", ''Journal for the Study of the Old Testament'' 45 (1989), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Raymond Westbrook]], the story is essentially a hypothetical problem, introduced to the recipient as a pure intellectual challenge and not as a concrete juridical case. In such problems, any unnecessary detail is usually omitted, and this is the reason why the characters in the story have no distinctive characteristics. Also, the description of the case eliminates the possibility to obtain circumstantial evidence, thereby forcing the recipient to confront the dilemma directly and not seek for indirect ways to solve it.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Westbrook, "Law in Kings", in [[André Lemaire]], Baruch Halpern, and Matthew J. Adams (eds.), ''The Book of Kings: Sources, Composition, Historiography and Reception'' (Supplements to Vetus Testamentum 129), Leiden: Brill, 2010, pp. 446–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars think that the original folk story underwent significant literary reworking so that in its biblical crystallization it can no longer be defined as a folktale. Jacob Liver notes the absence of any "local coloring" in the story, and concludes that the story is "not an actual folk tale but a scholarly reworking of a folk tale (apparently from a non-Israelite source) which in some way reached the court circles of Jerusalem in the times of Solomon".&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Liver, "The Book of the Acts of Solomon", ''Biblica'' 48 (1967), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Jeev Weisman characterizes it as "a [[Wisdom literature|wisdom]] [[anecdote]] which originated in the court circles".&lt;ref&gt;Translation from the Hebrew original: "אנקדוטה חכמתית שמוצאה מחוגי החצר" (Jeev Weisman, ''Political Satire in the Bible'' [The Biblical Encyclopaedia Library 13], Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1996, p. 213). George W. Coats also characterizes it as an anecdote ("Parable, Fable, and Anecdote: Storytelling in the Succession Narrative", ''Interpretation'' 35 [1981], p. 379)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The story has a number of parallels in folktales from various cultures. All of the known parallels, among them several from [[India]], have been recorded in later periods than the biblical story; nevertheless, it is unclear as to whether they reflect earlier or later traditions. [[Hermann Gunkel]] rules out the possibility that such a sophisticated motif had developed independently in different places.&lt;ref name="Hermann Gunkel 1987, p. 156"&gt;Hermann Gunkel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CC_bBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Folktale in the Old Testament''] (Historic Texts and Interpreters in Biblical Scholarship), translated by Michael D. Rutter, Sheffield, UK: Almond, 1987, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars are of the opinion that the source of the story is untraceable.&lt;ref name="MontgomeryGehman"&gt;James A. Montgomery and Henry Snyder Gehman, [https://archive.org/stream/criticalexegetic10montuoft#page/108/mode/2up ''Kings''] (International Critical Commentary), Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1951, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gwilym H. Jones, ''1 and 2 Kings'' (New Century Bible), I, Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1984, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the biblical version, the two women are identified as prostitutes, as opposed to some Indian versions in which they are widows of one husband. Some scholars have inferred from this difference as to the origin of the story. Following Gressmann,&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Gressmann, [https://archive.org/stream/deutscherundsch130stutuoft#page/218/mode/2up "Das salomonische Urteil"], ''Deutsche Rundschau'' 130 (1907), pp. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Gunkel speculates a possible Indian origin, on the basis that "[s]uch stories of wise judgments are the real life stuff of the Indian people", and that, in his view, "a prostitute has no reason to value a child which was not born to her"; he acknowledges, however, that the Indian versions "belong to a later period".&lt;ref name="Hermann Gunkel 1987, p. 156"/&gt; On the other hand, Lasine opines that the Hebrew story is better motivated than the Indian one, for it is the only one in which the motivation for the behavior of both women is rooted in typical motherly feelings: compassion for the true mother, and jealousy for the impostor.&lt;ref name="Lasine"&gt;Stuart Lasine, "The Riddle of Solomon’s Judgment and the Riddle of Human Nature in the Hebrew Bible", ''Journal for the Study of the Old Testament'' 45 (1989), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars point out that such a travelling folktale might become, in its various forms, more or less coherent; the assertion that one version is more coherent than the other does not compel the conclusion that the first is more original.&lt;ref name="William Hansen 2002, p. 228"/&gt; Consequently, the argument as to which version's women had more compelling reasons to fight over the child would be irrelevant.

==Composition and editorial framing==
The story is considered to be literarily unified, without significant editorial intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Mulder, ''1 Kings'' (Historical Commentary on the Old Testament), translated by John Vriend, Leuven: Peeters, 1998, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burke O. Long 1984, p. 68"&gt;Burke O. Long, [https://books.google.co.il/books?id=o3Vxhco6ItcC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''1 Kings''] (Forms of the Old Testament Literature 9), Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1984, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The ending of the story, noting the wisdom of Solomon, is considered to be a [[Deuteronomist]]ic addition to the text.&lt;ref name="Mordechai Cogan 2001, p. 196"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Volkmar Fritz, ''1 &amp; 2 Kings'' (Continental Commentary), translated by Anselm Hagedorn, Minneapolis: Fortress, 2003, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars consider the story an originally independent unit, integrated into its present context by an editor.&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Cogan, ''I Kings'' (Anchor Bible), New York: Doubleday, 2001, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon J. DeVries, ''1 Kings'' (Word Biblical Commentary 12), Waco, TX: Word Books, 1985, pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon's name is not mentioned in the story, and he is simply called "the king". Considered out of context, the story leaves the king anonymous just like the other characters. Some scholars think that the original tale was not necessarily about Solomon, and perhaps dealt with a typical unnamed king. A different opinion is held by Eli Yassif, who thinks that the author of the Book of Kings did not attribute the story to Solomon on his own behalf, but the attribution to Solomon had already developed in preliterary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Yassif, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LbZPv-2LO6YC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Hebrew Folktale: History, Genre, Meaning''] (Folklore Studies in Translation), Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1999, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars point out that the story is linked to the preceding account of Solomon's dream in Gibeon, by the common pattern of prophetic dream and its subsequent fulfillment. Some think this proximity of the stories results from the work of a [[Redaction|redactor]]. Others, such as Saul Zalewski, consider the two accounts to be inseparable and to form a literarily unified unit.&lt;ref&gt;Saul Zalewski, ''Solomon's Ascension to the Throne: Studies in the Books of Kings and Chronicles'', Jerusalem: Y. Marcus, 1981, pp. 188–92 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

In its broader context, the Judgment of Solomon forms part of the account of Solomon's reign, generally conceived as a distinct segment in the Book of Kings, compassing chapters 3–11 in 1 Kings; Some include in it also chapters 1–2, while others think that these chapters originally ended the account of David's reign in 2 Samuel. According to Liver, the source for the Judgment of Solomon story, as well as other parts of the account of Solomon's reign, is in the speculated book of the [[Acts of Solomon]], which he proposes to be a wisdom work which originated in the court circles shortly after the split of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|united monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Liver, "The Book of the Acts of Solomon", ''Biblica'' 48 (1967), pp. 75–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==

===General description===
The story may be divided to two parts similar in length, matching the trial's sequence. In the first part (verses 16–22) the case is described: The two women introduce their arguments, and at this point, no response from the king is recorded. In the second part (23–28) the decision is described: the king is the major speaker and the one who directs the plot. Apart from this clear twofold division, suggestions have been raised as to the plot structure and the literary structure of the story and its internal relations.&lt;ref&gt;For the plot structure see the commentaries, and also Bezalel Porten, "The Structure and Theme of the Solomon Narrative (I Kings 3-11)", ''Hebrew Union College Annual'' 38 (1967), pp. 99–100. For the literary structure see Willem A. M. Beuken, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BDlCAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "No Wise King without a Wise Woman (I Kings III 16–28)"], in A. S. van der Woude (ed.), ''New Avenues in the Study of the Old Testament: A Collection of Old Testament Studies, Published on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Oudtestamentisch Werkgezelschap and the Retirement of Prof. Dr. M. J. Mulder'' (Oudtestamentische Studiën 25), Leiden: Brill, 1989, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

As stated before, most of the story is reported by [[direct speech]] of the women and Solomon, with a few sentences and utterance verbs by the narrator. The dialogues move the plot forward.&lt;ref name="Burke O. Long 1984, p. 68"/&gt; The women's contradictory testimonies create the initial conflict necessary to build up the [[dramatic tension]]. The king's request to bring him a sword enhances the tension, as the reader wonders why it is needed. The story comes to its climax with the shocking royal order to cut the boy, which for a moment casts doubt on the king's judgment. But what seems to be the verdict turns out to be a clever trick which achieves its goal, and results in the recognition of the true mother and the resolution.

===Purpose===
The major overt purpose of the account of Solomon's reign, to which the Judgment of Solomon belongs as stated above, is to glorify King Solomon, and his wisdom is one of the account's dominant themes. The exceptions are: The first two chapters (1 Kings 1–2), which according to many scholars portray a dubious image of Solomon, and as stated above, are sometimes ascribed to a separate work; And the last chapter in the account (11), which describes Solomon's sins in his old age. Nevertheless, many scholars point out to elements in the account that criticize Solomon, anticipating his downfall in chapter 11.&lt;ref&gt;See in detail: Daniel J. Hays, "Has the Narrator Come to Praise Solomon or to Bury Him? Narrative Subtlety in 1 Kings 1–11", ''Journal for the Study of the Old Testament'' 28/2 (2003), pp. 149–74; And the literature cited at pp. 151–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its immediate context, the story follows the account of Solomon's dream at [[Gibeon (ancient city)|Gibeon]], in which he was promised by God to be given unprecedented wisdom. Most scholars read the story at face value, and conclude that its major purpose is to demonstrate the fulfillment of the divine promise and to illustrate Solomon's wisdom expressed in a juridical form. Yet some scholars recognize in this story too, as in other parts of the account of Solomon's reign, ironic elements which are not consistent with the story's overt purpose to glorify Solomon.

Some scholars assume, as mentioned, that the story had existed independently before it was integrated into its current context. Willem Beuken think that the original tale was not about the king's wisdom – the concluding note about Solomon's wisdom is considered secondary – but about a woman who, by listening to her motherly instinct, helped the king to break through the legal impasse. Beuken notes additional biblical stories which share the motif of the woman who influenced the king: [[Bathsheba]], the [[woman of Tekoa]], and Solomon's foreign wives who seduced him into idolatry.&lt;ref&gt;Willem A. M. Beuken, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BDlCAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "No Wise King without a Wise Woman (I Kings III 16–28)"], in A. S. van der Woude (ed.), ''New Avenues in the Study of the Old Testament: A Collection of Old Testament Studies, Published on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Oudtestamentisch Werkgezelschap and the Retirement of Prof. Dr. M. J. Mulder'' (Oudtestamentische Studiën 25), Leiden: Brill, 1989, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Beuken concludes that the true mother exemplifies the biblical character type of the wise woman.&lt;ref&gt;Willem A. M. Beuken, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BDlCAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "No Wise King without a Wise Woman (I Kings III 16–28)"], in A. S. van der Woude (ed.), ''New Avenues in the Study of the Old Testament: A Collection of Old Testament Studies, Published on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Oudtestamentisch Werkgezelschap and the Retirement of Prof. Dr. M. J. Mulder'' (Oudtestamentische Studiën 25), Leiden: Brill, 1989, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposes an analysis of the literary structure of the story, according to which the section that notes the compassion of the true mother (verse 26b) constitutes one of the two climaxes of the story, along with the section that announces Solomon's divine wisdom (verse 28b). According to this analysis, the story in its current context gives equal weight to the compassion of the true mother and to the godly wisdom that guided Solomon in the trial.&lt;ref&gt;Willem A. M. Beuken, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BDlCAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "No Wise King without a Wise Woman (I Kings III 16–28)"], in A. S. van der Woude (ed.), ''New Avenues in the Study of the Old Testament: A Collection of Old Testament Studies, Published on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Oudtestamentisch Werkgezelschap and the Retirement of Prof. Dr. M. J. Mulder'' (Oudtestamentische Studiën 25), Leiden: Brill, 1989, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Marvin A. Sweeney|Marvin Sweeney]], in its original context, as part of the [[Deuteronomistic history]], the story exalted Solomon as a wise ruler and presented him as a model to [[Hezekiah]]. Later, the narrative context of the story has undergone another Deuteronomistic redaction that has undermined Solomon's figure in comparison to [[Josiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Marvin A. Sweeney, [https://books.google.co.il/books?id=d4jn8uj49RIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''I &amp; II Kings''] (Old Testament Library), Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox, 2007, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In its current context, the story implicitly criticizes Solomon for violating the biblical law that sets the [[Priesthood (Ancient Israel)|priests]] and [[Levite]]s on top of the judicial hierarchy (Deuteronomy 17:8–13).&lt;ref&gt;Marvin A. Sweeney, ''I &amp; II Kings'' (Old Testament Library), Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox, 2007, pp. [https://books.google.co.il/books?id=d4jn8uj49RIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 73], [https://books.google.co.il/books?id=d4jn8uj49RIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 82].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intra-biblical allusions===
Several stories in the Hebrew Bible bear similarity to the Judgment of Solomon, and scholars think they allude to it.

The most similar story is that of the two cannibal mothers in 2 Kings 6:24–33, which forms part of the [[Elisha]] cycle. The background is a famine in [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]], caused by a siege on the city. As the king passes through the city, a woman calls him and asks him to decide in a quarrel between her and another woman: The two women had agreed to cook and eat the son of one woman, and on the other day to do the same with the son of the other woman; but after they ate the first woman's son, the other woman hid her own son. The king, shocked from the description of the case, tore up his royal cloth and revealed that he was wearing sackcloth beneath it. He blamed Elisha for the circumstances and went on to chase him.

There are some striking similarities between this story and the Judgment of Solomon. Both deal with nameless women who gave birth to a son. One of the son dies, and a quarrel erupts as to the fate of the other one. The case is brought before the king to decide. According to Lasine, the comparison between the stories emphasize the absurdity of the situation in the story of the cannibal mothers: While in the Judgment of Solomon, the king depend on his knowledge of maternal nature to decide the case, the story of the cannibal women describe a "topsy-turvy" world in which maternal nature does not work as expected, thus leaving the king helpless.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Lasine, "Jehoram and the Cannibal Mothers (2 Kings 6.24–33): Solomon’s Judgment in an Inverted World", ''Journal for the Study of the Old Testament'' 50 (1991), pp. 27–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The women's characters===
Like many other women in the Hebrew Bible, the two women in this story are anonymous. Perhaps their names have not been mentioned so that they would not overshadow Solomon's wisdom, which is the main theme of the story. The women seem to be poor. They live alone in a shared residence, without servants. As prostitutes, they lack male patronage and have to take care of themselves in a patriarchal society.&lt;ref&gt;Athalya Brenner, ''The Israelite Woman: Social Role and Literary Type in Biblical Narrative'' (The Biblical Seminar 2), Sheffield, UK: JSOT Press, 1985, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The women's designation as prostitutes is necessary as background to the plot: It clarifies why the women live alone, gave birth alone and were alone during the alleged switch of the babies;&lt;ref name="Simon J. DeVries 1985, p. 61"&gt;Simon J. DeVries, ''1 Kings'' (Word Biblical Commentary), Waco, TX: Word Books, 1985, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of witnesses seems to create a legal impasse that only the wise king can solve. It also clarifies why the women are not represented by their husbands, as is customary in biblical society.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Ann Bird, "The Harlot as Heroine: Narrative Art and Social Presupposition in Three Old Testament Texts", ''Semeia'' 46 (1989), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon is depicted as a king accessible to all of his subjects, even those in the margins of society.&lt;ref name="Simon J. DeVries 1985, p. 61"/&gt; The women's designation as prostitutes links the story to the common biblical theme of God as the protector of the weak, "A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows" (Psalms 68:5). Prostitutes in biblical society are considered functional widows, for they have no male patron to represent them in court, and their sons are considered fatherless. They also bear similarity to the [[proselyte]], who is sometimes mentioned in the Hebrew Bible with the widow and the fatherless, in that they are socially marginalized and deprived of the right to advocacy. They can only seek justice from one place: God, embodied in the story as the source of Solomon's wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Carole R. Fontaine, "The Bearing of Wisdom on the Shape of 2 Samuel 11-12 and 1 Kings 3", ''Journal for the Study of the Old Testament'' 34 (1986), pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gina Hens-Piazza, ''Of Methods, Monarchs, and Meanings: A Sociorhetorical Approach to Exegesis'' (Studies in Old Testament Interpretation 3), Macon, GA: Mercer University Press, 1996, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

The women are not explicitly condemned for their occupation,&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Cogan, ''I Kings'' (Anchor Bible), New York: Doubleday, 2001, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; and some think that the narrator does not intend to discredit them for being prostitutes, and their conduct should be judged against universal human standards.&lt;ref&gt;Volkmar Fritz, ''1 &amp; 2 Kings'' (Continental Commentary), translated by Anselm Hagedorn, Minneapolis: Fortress, 2003, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Phyllis Bird]] thinks that the story presupposes the stereotypical biblical image of the prostitute as a selfish liar. The true mother is revealed when her motherly essence – which is also stereotypical – surpasses her selfish essence.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Ann Bird, "The Harlot as Heroine: Narrative Art and Social Presupposition in Three Old Testament Texts", ''Semeia'' 46 (1989), pp. 132–33&lt;/ref&gt; [[Athalya Brenner]] notes that both women's maternal instinct is intact: For the true mother it is manifested, as mentioned, in the compassion and devotion that she shows for her son; And for the impostor it is manifested in her desire for a son, which makes her steal the other mother's son when her own son dies. According to Brenner, one of the lessons of the story is that "true maternal feelings&amp;nbsp;... may exist even in the bosom of the lowliest woman".&lt;ref&gt;Athalya Brenner, ''The Israelite Woman: Social Role and Literary Type in Biblical Narrative'' (The Biblical Seminar 2), Sheffield, UK: JSOT Press, 1985, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The women are designated in the Hebrew text as ''zōnōṯ'' (זוֹנוֹת), which is the plural form of the adjective ''zōnâ'' (זוֹנָה), prostitute. However, some propose a different meaning for this word in the context of the story, such as "tavern owner" or "innkeeper". These proposals are usually dismissed as apologetic.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Mordechai Cogan, ''I Kings'' (Anchor Bible), New York: Doubleday, 2001, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Jerome T. Walsh combines the two meanings, and suggests that in ancient Near East, some prostitutes also provided lodging services (cf. the story of [[Rahab]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jerome T. Walsh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=B7vv5v76kVUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''1 Kings''] (Berit Olam), Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1996, p. 80 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison to detective literature===
As mentioned before, many scholars have compared the story to the modern genre of [[Detective fiction|detective story]]. A striking feature in the biblical story, untypical to its parallels,&lt;ref&gt;William Hansen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ezDlXl7gP9oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA229#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature''], Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2002, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; is that it does not begin with a credible report of the [[omniscient narrator]] about the events that took place before the trial; It immediately opens with the women's testimonies. Thus, the reader is unable to determine whether the account given by the plaintiff is true or false, and he confronts, along with Solomon, a juridical-detective riddle. According to Sternberg, the basic convention shared by the Judgment of Solomon and the detective story genre is the "fair-play rule", which states that both the reader and the detective figure are exposed to the same relevant data.&lt;ref&gt;Meir Sternberg, ''The Poetics of Biblical Narrative: Ideological Literature and the Drama of Reading'' (Indiana Studies in Biblical Literature), Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1985, pp. 167–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lasine, dealing with the story from a sociological perspective, points out that like the detective story, the Judgment of Solomon story deals with human "epistemological anxiety" deriving from the fact that man, as opposed to God, is generally unable to know what is in the mind of other men. The detective story, as well as this biblical story, provides a comfort to this anxiety with the figure of the detective, or Solomon in this case: A master of human nature, a man who can see into the depths of one's soul and extract the truth from within it. This capability is conceived as a superhuman quality, inasmuch as Solomon's wisdom in judgment is described as a gift from God. There is an ambiguity concerning the question whether such a capability may serve as a model for others, or it is unavailable to ordinary men.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Lasine, [http://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/58746/HAR_v11_247.pdf?sequence=1 "Solomon, Daniel, and the Detective Story: The Social Function of a Literary Genre"], ''Hebrew Annual Review'' 11 (1987), pp. 247–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the story, Solomon reveals the identity of the true mother. But according to the Hebrew text, while the king solves the riddle, the reader is not exposed to the solution; Literally translated from the Hebrew text, Solomon command reads: "Give her the living child...". One cannot infer from this wording whether the word "her" refers to the plaintiff or to the defendant, as the narrator remains silent on the matter.

==Jewish interpretation==

According to the [[Midrash]], the two women were mother- and daughter-in-law, both of whom had borne sons and whose husbands had died. The lying daughter-in-law was obligated by the laws of [[Yibbum]] to marry her brother-in-law unless released from the arrangement through a formal ceremony. As her brother-in-law was the living child, she was required to marry him when he came of age or wait the same amount of time to be released and remarry. When Solomon suggested splitting the infant in half, the lying woman, wishing to escape the constraints of Yibbum in the eyes of God, agreed. Thus was Solomon able to know who the real mother was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jlaw.com/Commentary/solomon.html|title=Jewish Law – Commentary/Opinion – The Brilliant Wisdom of King Solomon|work=jlaw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representations in art==
If the above-mentioned [[Pompei|Pompean]] fresco indeed depicts the Judgment of Solomon, it is the first known painting of a biblical story (presently moved to the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|''Museo Nazionale'' in Naples]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/ancient-cultures/solomon-socrates-and-aristotle/|title=Solomon, Socrates and Aristotle|work=Biblical Archaeology Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theme has long been a popular subject for artists and is often chosen for the decoration of courthouses. In the Netherlands, many 17th century courthouses (''Vierschaar'' rooms) contain a painting or relief of this scene. Elsewhere in Europe, celebrated examples include:
* Fresco by [[Raphael]]
* The Judgement of Solomon by [[William Blake]]
* Etching by [[Gustave Doré]]
* Woodcut by the school of [[Michael Wolgemut]] in the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]]
* Paintings by [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Poussin]] and [[Franz Caucig]]
* Relief sculpture on the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] in Venice by an unknown artist (near the exit into St. Mark's Square)
* Stained glass window by Jean Chastellain in [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]] church of Paris

===Other media===
The scene has been the subject of television episodes of ''[[Dinosaurs (TV series)|Dinosaurs]]'', ''[[Recess (TV series)|Recess]]'', ''[[The Simpsons (TV series)|The Simpsons]]'' (where a pie was substituted for the baby), the [[Netflix]] animated series,  [[All Hail King Julien]], where a pineapple is cut in two to settle a dispute, the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode [[The Seven]], and ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]''. It has influenced other artistic disciplines, e.g. [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s play [[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]] and Ronnie snatching Kat's baby in ''[[EastEnders]]''.

The [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]] song "Shatter Me With Hope" includes the line "We'll tear this baby apart, wise like Solomon".

=="Splitting the baby"==
The expressions "splitting the baby" or "cutting the baby in half" can be used to describe a split award (usually accompanied by a split costs award) in the most for a heavy-handed, costs-insensitive suit (such as entailing multiple hearings and disproportionate spending on both sides) for a relatively simple compromise.  The analogy reminds litigants to keep their costs down in cases where [[judge]] may well divide fault, i.e. may "split the difference" in terms of [[Damages|damage awards]] or other [[Legal remedy|remedies]] between the two [[Party (law)|parties]] (a very common example is in a [[comparative negligence]] case also known as contributory negligence scenario).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eba-net.org/adrblog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/splitting-the-baby-article-by-naimark.pdf Stephanie E.

{{lang|la|'''Novum Testamentum Graece'''}} (''The New Testament in Greek'') is a [[critical edition]] of the [[New Testament]] in its original [[Koine Greek]], forming the basis of most modern [[Bible translations]] and [[biblical criticism]]. It is also known as the '''Nestle-Aland''' edition after its most influential editors, [[Eberhard Nestle]] and [[Kurt Aland]]. The text, edited by the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research]], is currently in its 28th edition, abbreviated '''NA28'''.

The title is sometimes applied to the [[United Bible Societies]] (UBS) edition, which contains the same text (its fifth edition, "UBS5", contains the text from NA28). The latter edition is aimed at translators and so focuses on variants that are important for the meaning whereas the NA includes more variants.

== Methodology ==

The Greek text as presented is what biblical [[scholars]] refer to as the [[Textual criticism|"critical text"]]. The critical text is an [[Textual criticism#Eclecticism|eclectic]] text compiled by a committee that compares readings from a large number of [[manuscript]]s in order to determine which reading is most likely to be closest to the original. They use a number of factors to help determine probable readings, such as the date of the witness (earlier is usually better), the geographical distribution of a reading, and the likelihood of accidental or intentional corruptions. In the book, a large number of textual variants, or differences between manuscripts, are noted in the [[critical apparatus]]—the extensive footnotes that distinguish the ''Novum Testamentum Graece'' from other Greek New Testaments.

Most scholars view [[List of New Testament uncials|uncial]] text as the most accurate; however, a few authors, such as New Testament scholar [[Maurice A. Robinson]]&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Maurice A. and William G. Pierpont (2005). ''The New Testament in the Original Greek: Byzantine Textform''. Southborough: Chilton.&lt;/ref&gt; and linguist Wilbur Pickering,&lt;ref&gt;Pickering, Wilbur (2012). ''The Identity of the New Testament Text III''. Eugene: Wipf and Stock.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Farstad]] and [[Zane C. Hodges]] claim that the [[List of New Testament minuscules|minuscule]] texts (the [[Byzantine text-type]]) more accurately reflect the "autographs" or original texts than an eclectic text like NA28 that relies heavily on manuscripts of the [[Alexandrian text-type]]. This view has been criticized by [[Gordon Fee]]&lt;ref&gt;Fee, Gordon (1979). "A Critique of W. N. Pickering's The Identity of the New Testament Text" ''[[Westminster Theological Journal]]'', 41. 397-423.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bruce Metzger]]&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, Bruce (1992). ''The Text of the New Testament''. 3rd ed. New York: Oxford University Press. 290-293.&lt;/ref&gt; among others. Since the majority of old manuscripts in existence are minuscules, they are often referred to as the [[Majority Text]]. It is worth noting, though, that the Majority Text as a whole is classified by the editors of the NA28 (of whom Metzger is one) as a "consistently cited witness of the first order," meaning that whenever the text presented differs from the majority text this is recorded in the apparatus along with the alternate reading.&lt;ref name="Novum Testamentum Graece 1993"&gt;''Novum Testamentum Graece'' (1993) Barbara and Kurt Aland, eds. Stuttgart: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft. 12*.&lt;/ref&gt; Other consistently cited references include the full corpus of papyrus manuscripts available to the authors as well as a wide range of other manuscripts including a selection of both minuscules and uncials.&lt;ref name="Novum Testamentum Graece 1993"/&gt;

The ''Novum Testamentum Graece'' apparatus summarizes the evidence (from manuscripts and versions) for, and sometimes against, a selection of the most important variants for the study of the text of the New Testament. While eschewing completeness (in the range of variants and in the citation of witnesses), this edition does provide informed readers with a basis by which they can judge for themselves which readings more accurately reflect the originals. The Greek text of the 28th edition is the same as that of the 5th edition of the [[United Bible Societies]] ''The Greek New Testament'' (abbreviated UBS5) although there are a few differences between them in paragraphing, capitalization, punctuation and spelling.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, J. K. (1996). "A Comparison of Two Recent Greek New Testaments", The Expository Times, Volume 107, Number 4, pages 105-106.&lt;/ref&gt; The critical apparatus is different in the two editions; the UBS4 edition is prepared for the use of translators, and includes fewer textual variants, but adds extra material helpful for translators.

== Editions ==

===History===
The first edition published by [[Eberhard Nestle]] in 1898 combined the readings of the editions of [[Constantin von Tischendorf#Works|Tischendorf]], [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott and Hort]] and [[Richard Francis Weymouth|Weymouth]], placing the majority reading of these in the text and the third reading in the apparatus. In 1901, he replaced the [[Weymouth New Testament]] with [[Bernhard Weiss]]'s text. In later editions, Nestle began noting the attestation of certain important manuscripts in his apparatus.

Eberhard's son [[Erwin Nestle]] took over after his father's death and issued the 13th edition in 1927. This edition introduced a separate critical apparatus and finally introduced consistency to the majority reading principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Text of the New Testament|last=Aland|first=Kurt and Barbara|publisher=Eerdmans|year=1989|isbn=9780802840981|location=Grand Rapids|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the apparatus only a few minuscules were included.&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Holmes, ''From Nestle to the `Editio Critica Maior`'', in: ''The Bible as Book: The Transmission of the Greek Text'', London 2003, p. 127. {{ISBN|0-7123-4727-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kurt Aland]] became the associate editor of the 21st edition in 1952. At Erwin Nestle's request, he reviewed and expanded the critical apparatus, adding many more manuscripts. This eventually led to the 25th edition of 1963. The most important Papyri and newly discovered Uncials, as [[Uncial 0189|0189]], a few Minuscules ([[Minuscule 33|33]], [[Minuscule 614|614]], [[Minuscule 2814|2814]]), occasionally also lectionaries were taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Holmes, ''From Nestle to the `Editio Critica Maior`'', in: ''The Bible as Book: The Transmission of the Greek Text'', London 2003, p. 128. {{ISBN|0-7123-4727-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great manuscript discoveries of the 20th century had also made a revision of the text necessary and, with Nestle's permission, Aland set out to revise the text of ''Novum Testamentum Graece''. Aland submitted his work on NA to the editorial committee of the United Bible Societies ''Greek New Testament'' (of which he was also a member) and it became the basic text of their third edition (UBS3) in 1975, four years before it was published as the 26th edition of Nestle-Aland.

: [[Kurt Aland]], [[Matthew Black]], [[Bruce Metzger]], [[Allen Wikgren]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academic-bible.com/en/home/scholarly-editions/greek-new-testament/greek-new-testament/&lt;/ref&gt;
* UBS2, 1968
: [[Kurt Aland]], [[Matthew Black]], [[Bruce Metzger]], [[Allen Wikgren]].
* UBS3, 1975
: [[Kurt Aland]], [[Matthew Black]], [[Carlo Maria Martini]], [[Bruce Metzger]], [[Allen Wikgren]].
* UBS4, 1993
: [[Barbara Aland]], [[Kurt Aland]], [[Johannes Karavidopoulos]], [[Carlo Maria Martini]], [[Bruce Metzger]]
* UBS5, 2014
: [[Barbara Aland]], [[Kurt Aland]], [[Johannes Karavidopoulos]], [[Carlo Maria Martini]], [[Bruce Metzger]] in co-operation with the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research]], Münster&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academic-bible.com/en/home/scholarly-editions/greek-new-testament/vergleich-na28-ubs5/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the Global Board of the [[United Bible Societies]] appointed a new editorial committee that will prepare future editions of the ''Nestle-Aland Novum Testamentum Graece'' as well as of the ''Greek New Testament''. The committee consists of [[Christos Karakolis]] (University of Athens, Greece), [[David C Parker|David Parker]] (University of Birmingham, United Kingdom), Stephen Pisano (Pontifical Biblical Institute, Italy, a university of the [[Holy See]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblico.it/storia.html&lt;/ref&gt;), Holger Strutwolf (University Münster, Germany), [[David Trobisch]] ([[Museum of the Bible (Washington, D.C.)|Museum of the Bible]]/[[Green Collection]] Oklahoma City, USA) and Klaus Wachtel (University Münster, Germany).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academic-bible.com/en/home/scholarly-editions/greek-new-testament/new-editorial-committee/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In all but the Catholic Epistles, the 28th edition of Nestle-Aland reproduces the text of NA27 (the same text used in UBS4 and UBS5) and presents a revised critical apparatus and a rewritten introduction and appendices. In the Catholic Epistles, the text has been edited in line with the ''[[Editio Critica Maior]]'' and its use of the Coherence-Based Genealogical Method (CBGM). The result is a change in just over 30 places.

A more complete set of variants is listed in the multiple volume ''Novum Testamentum Graecum – [[Editio Critica Maior]]''. A small number of textual changes in the most current edition were incorporated in the 28th edition of the Nestle-Aland,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/ECM/ECM-index.html University of Bremen list of textual updates for Nestle-Aland 28] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424062451/http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/ECM/ECM-index.html |date=2008-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2012. Papyri [[Papyrus 117|117]]-[[Papyrus 127|127]] were used in this edition.

== Accuracy of manuscripts ==

In ''The Text of the New Testament'', [[Kurt Aland]] and [[Barbara Aland]] compare the total number of variant-free verses, and the number of variants per page (excluding [[Orthography|orthographic]] errors), among the seven major editions of the Greek NT ([[Editio Octava Critica Maior|Tischendorf]], [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott-Hort]], [[Hermann, Freiherr von Soden|von Soden]], Vogels, Merk, Bover, and Nestle-Aland) concluding 62.9%, or 4999/7947, agreement.&lt;ref name=Aland&gt;K. Aland and B. Aland, ''The Text of the New Testament: An Introduction to the Critical Editions &amp; to the Theory &amp; Practice of Modern Textual Criticism'', 1995, op. cit., p. 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded, "Thus in nearly two-thirds of the New Testament text, the seven editions of the Greek New Testament which we have reviewed are in complete accord, with no differences other than in orthographical details (e.g., the spelling of names, etc.). Verses in which any one of the seven editions differs by a single word are not counted. This result is quite amazing, demonstrating a far greater agreement among the Greek texts of the New Testament during the past century than [[Textual criticism|textual scholars]] would have suspected […]. In the [[Gospels]], [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] the agreement is less, while in the [[Epistles|letters]] it is much greater."&lt;ref name=Aland /&gt;  For over 250 years, New Testament scholars have argued that no textual variant affects key Christian doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Daniel|title=The Majority Text and the Original Text: Are They Identical?|url=https://bible.org/article/majority-text-and-original-text-are-they-identical|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==

Earlier translations of the Bible, including the [[Authorized King James Version]], tended to rely on [[Byzantine text-type|Byzantine type texts]], such as the [[Textus Receptus]]. A number of translations began to use critical Greek editions, beginning with the translation of the [[Revised Version]] in England in 1881-1885 (using Westcott and Hort's Greek Text). English translations produced during the twentieth century increasingly reflected the work of textual criticism, although even new translations are often influenced by earlier translation efforts.

A comparison of the textual and stylistic choices of twenty translations against 15,000 variant readings shows the following rank of agreement with the Nestle-Aland 27th edition:&lt;ref&gt;T.E. Clontz (2008), ''The Comprehensive New Testament''. Clewiston: Cornerstone Publications. ii, iii, vii; graphs on iii and back cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Panait Cerna''' ({{IPA-ro|panaˈit ˈt͡ʃerna}}; [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: Панайот Черна, ''Panayot Cherna'', born '''Panayot Stanchov''' or '''Panait Staciov'''; August 26 or September 25, 1881&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.651. The second date is reported to have been once communicated by Cerna himself&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; March 26, 1913) was a [[Romania]]n poet, philosopher, literary critic and translator. A native speaker of Bulgarian, Cerna nonetheless wrote in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and developed a traditionalist style which was connected with [[Classicism]] and [[Neoclassicism]]. Praised by the [[Conservatism|conservative]] literary society ''[[Junimea]]'', he was promoted by its leader [[Titu Maiorescu]], as well as by Maiorescu's disciples [[Mihail Dragomirescu]] and [[Simion Mehedinţi]]. Cerna became the group's main representative during its decline, contributing to both major Junimist magazines, ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' and ''[[Convorbiri Critice]]''. He also contributed pieces to the traditionalist magazine ''[[Sămănătorul]]'', and was briefly affiliated with other literary journals.

A graduate of the [[University of Bucharest]], Cerna completed his studies in the [[German Empire]]. There, he attended the [[University of Berlin]] and the [[University of Leipzig]], befriending the self-exiled Romanian dramatist [[Ion Luca Caragiale]] and the literary critic [[Paul Zarifopol]]. Cerna died in [[Leipzig]] at the age of thirty-one, after a long battle with [[tuberculosis]].

Along with various love poems, Panait Cerna's writings also evince his intellectual pursuits. This intellectual characteristic earned him a dedicated following, but was criticized by many of his peers, who found it artificial and outdated.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Cerna's early name, rendered in Bulgarian as Панайот Станчов, was commonly [[Romanization of Bulgarian|transliterated]] into Romanian as ''Panait Stanciov'', ''Stancov'', ''Stanciof'' or ''Stancioff''. The poet's preferred name alluded to [[Cerna, Tulcea|Cerna]], his birthplace in [[Tulcea County]], [[Northern Dobruja]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu"&gt;Călinescu, p.651&lt;/ref&gt;

Panait Cerna's father was an [[Bulgarians|ethnic Bulgarian]] schoolteacher, also named Panayot Stachov (Panait Stanciov).&lt;ref name="Călinescu"/&gt; He settled in Cerna and married Maria Taşcu. The daughter of local peasants,&lt;ref name="Călinescu"/&gt; she was of [[Aromanians|Aromanian]]&lt;ref name="msdobr"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mirela Stîngă, [http://www.ziuaconstanta.ro/rubrici/cultura/panait-cerna,-poetul-meleagurilor-dobrogene.html "Panait Cerna, poetul meleagurilor dobrogene"], in ''[[Ziua|Ziua de Constanţa]]'', April 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; or of Bulgarian origin.&lt;ref&gt;Petar Karchev, ''През прозореца на едно полустолетие (1900–1950)'', Iztok-Zapad, Sofia, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;449–450. {{ISBN|954-321-056-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before Maria gave birth to their son, Romanian administration began taking over in previously [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-ruled Northern Dobruja. Stanchov, who was a Bulgarian [[Nationalism|nationalist]], refused to accept this change and left for the [[Principality of Bulgaria]], leaving his family behind. Consequently, Cerna never met his father.&lt;ref name="Călinescu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Călinescu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="msdobr"/&gt; By Cerna's own account, his childhood was marked by acute poverty and social isolation: "[I was] told to tutor and learn in cold, unfriendly rooms. For a long time, we lived in a house on the outskirts, which was avoided by other men, since a rumor had spread that ghosts haunted its rooms. Can you imagine living in the middle of winter, without a fire on, with doors that barely close, with windows that are glued with paper? A person made of iron would still feel cold down to the bone."&lt;ref name="msdobr"/&gt;

Although his links to [[Culture of Bulgaria|Bulgarian culture]] were weakened by his father's departure, Cerna, who was baptized in the [[Bulgarian Greek Catholic Church]], became fluent in Bulgarian.&lt;ref name="Călinescu"/&gt; According to literary critic [[George Călinescu]], he always had some difficulties conversing in Romanian, but could write it with ease.&lt;ref name="Călinescu_2"&gt;Călinescu, p.651, 652&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing primary school in his native village, he graduated from a high school in the [[Danube]] port of [[Brăila]], then enrolled at the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy in [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="msdobr"/&gt; He was also attending lectures at the Faculty of Chemistry and Physics.&lt;ref name="msdobr"/&gt; Cerna debuted as a poet in 1897, at the age of sixteen, when his ''Trecutul'' ("The Past")—an adaptation of a piece by [[Nikolaus Lenau]]—was published in [[George Coşbuc]]'s ''Foaia Interesantă'' magazine.&lt;ref name="msdobr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcunifi"&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.unifi.it/letrum/CMpro-v-p-1001.html "Panait Cerna"], biographical note in [http://www.unifi.it/letrum/ ''Cronologia della letteratura rumena moderna (1780–1914)'' database], at the [[University of Florence]]'s Department of Neo-Latin Languages and Literatures; retrieved April 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; His first original poem, ''Orientale'' ("Orientals"), saw print two years later in the magazine ''Carmen''.&lt;ref name="msdobr"/&gt;

===''Junimea'' years===
Soon after reaching the capital, Cerna became involved in political debates and the literary environment. These early activities are recorded in a 1904 series of articles in the student paper ''Tipuri şi Ticuri'', where a ''P. Stanciov'' is the object of [[satire]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu"/&gt; By that time, he was discovered by ''Junimea'', and began collaborating with ''Convorbiri Literare'', a magazine led by [[Simion Mehedinţi]].&lt;ref name="Ornea"&gt;Ornea, p.78; Vianu, Vol.II, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; After 1903, Cerna contributed  to ''[[Sămănătorul]]'',&lt;ref name="msdobr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; and his poems also appeared sporadically in other publications, including ''Floare Albastră'' and ''Revista Modernă''.&lt;ref name="msdobr"/&gt;

Despite ongoing financial difficulties, Cerna graduated from university in 1906.&lt;ref name="Călinescu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="msdobr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcunifi"/&gt; His thesis was passed with a ''[[Latin honors|Magna cum laude]]'' qualifier.&lt;ref name="msdobr"/&gt; He was by then seriously ill with tuberculosis, and sought a change in climate.&lt;ref name="Călinescu_3"&gt;Călinescu, p.652&lt;/ref&gt; Cerna spent much of this period traveling through the [[Romanian Old Kingdom|Old Kingdom]], and several times visited regions of the [[Southern Carpathians]], in particular the area of [[Rucăr]], the [[Bucegi Mountains]], and the [[Jiu Valley]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu_3"/&gt; As Călinescu notes, he had bought himself a horse from a Rucăr local on credit, and failed to deliver the promised sum on time.&lt;ref name="Călinescu_3"/&gt;

Cerna's love of rural life, together with what Călinescu describes as a "social preoccupation", made him an outspoken opponent of the way in which the authorities handled the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|peasant uprising of 1907]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu_3"/&gt; That year, as [[Mihail Dragomirescu]] parted with Mehedinţi to establish ''Convorbiri Critice'', which advertised a ''Junimist'' agenda while standing against ''Convorbiri Literare'', Cerna became one of his main collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.&amp;nbsp;136–137&lt;/ref&gt; The group of ''Convorbiri Critice'' writers also included [[D. Nanu]], [[Corneliu Moldovanu]], [[Emil Gârleanu]], [[I. Dragoslav]] and [[Gheorghe Vâlsan]].&lt;ref name="Ornea_2"&gt;Ornea, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, he decided to continue his studies in the [[German Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.602, 651&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was influenced and encouraged by ''Junimea'' and its leader [[Titu Maiorescu]],&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.602; Vianu, Vol.II, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; who, as [[Minister of Education, Research and Youth (Romania)|Minister of Education]] granted him a [[scholarship]].&lt;ref name="msdobr"/&gt; Călinescu describes this as a sign of late ''Junimist'' [[elitism]], a view which implied that all literary men should be academics.&lt;ref name="Călinescu_4"&gt;Călinescu, p.602&lt;/ref&gt; This, he argues, was one of the few areas in which ''Junimea'' still differed from ''Sămănătorul'', which was more open to less elitist environments.&lt;ref name="Călinescu_4"/&gt;

Cerna visited the [[University of Heidelberg]], but, following the advice of Maiorescu, decided in favor of the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], where he studied Philosophy, [[English literature|English]] and [[German language literature]] (1908–1910).&lt;ref name="Călinescu"/&gt; Around 1909, he first came into contact with the Caragiales, and, according to the dramatist's own testimony, tutored his son, the future poet [[Luca Caragiale]], providing his "scientific education".&lt;ref name="Călinescu"/&gt; Ion Luca Caragiale described Cerna as "a distinguished scientist and a great lover of music".&lt;ref name="Călinescu"/&gt; The two writers met a second time in [[Leipzig]], in 1910, when Cerna declared himself captivated by Caragiale, whom he described as "one of the richest intelligent minds to have ever been produced by our nation."&lt;ref name="Călinescu"/&gt; Two years later, Cerna enthusiastically welcomed the literary debut of Caragiale's other son, [[Mateiu Caragiale|Mateiu]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.898&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies abroad and death===
From late 1910 to early 1912, Cerna was at the [[University of Leipzig]], where he attended courses held by the philosophers and psychologists [[Wilhelm Wundt]], [[Eduard Spranger]] and [[Hans Volkelt]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu_2"/&gt; Wundt left an enduring impression on his Romanian student. In a letter home, Cerna described his modest appearance, which he claimed recalled that of "decrepit" [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] members of the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jewish community]], adding: "But I do love this decrepit exterior beyond measure&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="Călinescu_3"/&gt; Volkelt guided Cerna's research in the scientific field, and coordinated his [[PhD]] thesis of 1913, ''Die Gedankenlyrik'' ([[German language|German]] for "Contemplative Poetry").&lt;ref name="Călinescu"/&gt; According to Călinescu, Cerna's work stated the primacy of "natural ideas" over [[reasoning]], and concluded that "ideas have the purpose of signaling the problematic tensions of the soul."&lt;ref name="Călinescu"/&gt; Zarifopol wrote that Cerna was upset over having himself parted with writing poetry, and came to be preoccupied by Maiorescu's German-language dictum: ''In der Poesie ist der Gedanke ein verfluchtes Ding'' ("An idea is a damned thing when it comes to poetry").&lt;ref name="zarifartisti"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Zarifopol]], [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Arti%C5%9Fti_%C5%9Fi_idei_literare_rom%C3%A2ne:Poezie_filozofic%C4%83 ''Artişti şi idei literare române: Poezie filozofică''] (wikisource)&lt;/ref&gt; Panait Cerna's first volume of collected poetry was published at home in 1910, and, two years later, resulted in the author being made a co-recipient of the [[Romanian Academy]]'s [[Vasile Adamachi]] Award.&lt;ref name="msdobr"/&gt; Some of his new poems were still being published by ''Convorbiri Literare'' in 1911.&lt;ref name="icvieata"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ilarie Chendi]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/luceafarul/1912/BCUCLUJ_FP_280091_1912_011_003.pdf "Vieaţa literară în 1911 (o privire generală)"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 3/1912, p.62 (digitized by the [[Babeş-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

Panait Cerna died in Leipzig, shortly after receiving his diploma.&lt;ref name="msdobr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Călinescu_3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zarifartisti"/&gt; Zarifopol was present when Cerna succumbed, and recorded that Maiorescu's views on poetry where preoccupied his friend even on his deathbed.&lt;ref name="zarifartisti"/&gt; The poet was buried in the German city, and later exhumed for burial in Bucharest's [[Bellu Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="msdobr"/&gt;

==Literary contribution==
Cerna was a traditionalist poet, listed by Călinescu among the contributors to [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] whose work "steers toward [[Classicism]]", as do those of Dragomirescu, Mehedinţi, [[Henri Sanielevici]], [[D. Nanu]], [[Ion Trivale]], [[Cincinat Pavelescu]], [[Corneliu Moldovanu]], [[Mihail Codreanu]], [[Alexandru Davila]] and [[George Murnu]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;641–660&lt;/ref&gt; In this account, Cerna is one in a group of "conceptual" poets, all of whom were connected with Dragomirescu.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.652, 657&lt;/ref&gt; For part of his life, Cerna was also formally committed to [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|local Symbolist movement]], whose aesthetic ideals he merged with his lyrical style, and sought to recover part of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] legacy.&lt;ref name="pcunifi"/&gt; He was thus known as the translator of works by Romantic poets, as well as for adopting a [[Messianism|Messianic]] and [[Humanism|Humanist]] perspective on life (notably present in his poems ''Floare şi genune'', "Flower and Chasm"; ''Zile de durere'', "Days of Sorrow"; and ''Plânsetul lui Adam'', "[[Adam]]'s Sobbing").&lt;ref name="pcunifi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovinescu"&gt;Lovinescu, p.84&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary historian [[Tudor Vianu]] notes the influence exercised on Cerna and other traditionalists by [[Mihai Eminescu]], Romania's major mid-19th century Classicist and ''Junimist'' poet.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.213; Vol.III, p.322&lt;/ref&gt; [[Modernism|modernist]] theorist [[Eugen Lovinescu]] also believes that the "matter in which [Cerna] worked" was largely "dominated by Eminescu."&lt;ref name="Lovinescu"/&gt; He also cautions that there is a major difference between the two: Cerna is an [[Optimism|optimist]], while Eminescu most often projected a [[Pessimism|pessimistic]] attitude.&lt;ref name="Lovinescu_2"&gt;Lovinescu, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zarifopol, the poet considered himself an "improved follower" of Eminescu.&lt;ref name="zarifgeniul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Zarifopol]], [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Arti%C5%9Fti_%C5%9Fi_idei_literare_rom%C3%A2ne:Geniul_neprih%C4%83nit ''Artişti şi idei literare române: Geniul neprihănit''] (wikisource)&lt;/ref&gt; Cerna was also a late admirer of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], a main figure of [[England|English]] Romanticism, and translated from his ''[[Childe Harold]]''.&lt;ref name="etetudes"&gt;[[Emil Turdeanu|Émile Turdeanu]], ''Études de littérature roumaine et d'écrits slaves et grecs des principautés roumaines'', [[Brill Publishers]], Leiden, New York &amp; Köln, 1985, p.397. {{ISBN|90-04-07098-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Cerna's poems was an [[Epic poetry|epic]] piece inspired by the [[Book of Genesis]], where Adam confronts God. Titled ''Plânsetul lui Adam'', it builds on themes which recalled Byron's 1821 play ''[[Cain (play)|Cain]]'', and constituted an interrogation of [[divine law]]s.&lt;ref name="etetudes"/&gt;

In ''Plânsetul lui Adam'' and various other pieces, Panait Cerna (called a "reflexive poet" by contemporary critic [[Ilarie Chendi]])&lt;ref name="icvieata"/&gt; sought to reconcile poetry and philosophy, thus creating a hybrid form of conceptual poetry. Eugen Lovinescu proposed that, although praised by Cerna's contemporaries, this goal was "mediocre", and that the literature it produced "does not express and does not suggest profound spiritual states, but, on the contrary, it expresses by means of [[rhetoric]]al [[dialectic]] not only that which can be expressed, but also that which can be proven."&lt;ref name="Lovinescu"/&gt; Paul Zarifopol, who notes that Cerna particularly treasured the Classicist poets [[Friedrich Schiller]], [[Louise-Victorine Ackermann]] and [[Jean-Marie Guyau]], as well as the [[Parnassianism|Parnassian]] [[Sully Prudhomme]],&lt;ref name="zarifartisti"/&gt; recounted their disagreement when it came to Caragiale, whom Cerna enjoyed only for his power of "observation", but whom he argued lacked "concepts".&lt;ref name="zarifgeniul"/&gt; For Zarifopol, this statement, made with "a fanatical and dogmatic pathos", evidenced a moment of "academic foolishness" in Cerna's career.&lt;ref name="zarifgeniul"/&gt;

Călinescu, who criticizes the poet for his difficulties with the language, describes him as "not accomplished".&lt;ref name="Călinescu_3"/&gt; Elaborating on this, he states: "[Cerna is] declamatory, banal and dry in his use of metaphors, although he displays a touch of the sublime here and there."&lt;ref name="Călinescu_3"/&gt; Lovinescu thought many of the expressions Cerna used in his poetry to be "unacceptable", and argued that they were characterized by banality.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;805–806; Lovinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;84–85&lt;/ref&gt; This assessment was itself contested by Călinescu, who argued that the lyrics in questions are "actually the acceptable ones", and that the awkward wordings "are entirely lost in lyrical fluency."&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;805–806&lt;/ref&gt; Among the writings forming the subject of this disagreement was Cerna's ''Din depărtare'' ("From Far Away"), which Lovinescu believed was marked by the use of repetitive and banal poetic images:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Nu ţi-am vorbit vrodată,&lt;!-- sic --&gt; şi pe fereşti deschise
Nu ţi-am trimis buchete, stăpâna mea din vise,
Ci numai de departe te-am urmărit adese,
Iluminat de gânduri nespuse, ne-nţelese&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;ref name="Lovinescu_2"/&gt;
|
I never spoke with you, and through open windows
I never sent you bouquets, mistress of my dreams, 
But merely have been often watching you from afar,
Illuminated by untold, unknown words}}

The subject of [[unrequited love]] was one of the major ones in Cerna's [[Lyric poetry|lyric poems]] and, Călinescu argues, it evoked his actual experience with women, as "the regret of not having lived through the great mystery of love."&lt;ref name="Călinescu_3"/&gt; These pieces, the critic notes, point to the influence of Classicist authors such as Eminescu, [[Dante Aligheri]], and [[Giacomo Leopardi]] (the latter poet had also been quoted in Cerna's ''Die Gedankenlyrik'').&lt;ref name="Călinescu_3"/&gt; One of the pieces, written from the perspective of a man who has once failed to gain the object of his affection, features the lyrics:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Cărarea mea subţire se umple de lumină,
Încât mă-mpac cu viaţa-mi şi uit că-mi eşti străină.
Ce vrea şi unde merge un fulger? Cui ce-i pasă!&amp;nbsp;... 
Destul că face noaptea, o clipă, mai frumoasă.}}&lt;ref name="Călinescu_3"/&gt;
|
My thin path is being flooded in light, 
So that I reconcile with my life and forget you are a stranger.
What does a bolt want, and where does it go? Who should even care!&amp;nbsp;... 
It is enough that, for a moment, it makes the night more beautiful.}}

While rejecting Cerna's conceptual approach, Lovinescu admired his style, for "the amplitude through which [the sentiment] is laid out in vast chimes and compact constructions of rhetorical stanzas."&lt;ref name="Lovinescu_2"/&gt; Such features, he concluded, surpassed "everything ever written in our country".&lt;ref name="Lovinescu_2"/&gt; For George Călinescu, Cerna's "euphoric thirst for life" recalled the work of Parnassian and Symbolist author [[Alexandru Macedonski]], but was tempered by "the mellow [[anemia]] of the phthisic."&lt;ref name="Călinescu_3"/&gt; One of his better-known pieces from the series of love poems read:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Noi ne-am cuprins de-o flacără curată,
Ce niciodată n-are să apuie -
Şi nu furăm norocul nimănuie,
Ci în iubire tânără, bogată,
Îmbrăţişăm pământul, lumea toată.}}&lt;ref name="Călinescu_3"/&gt;
|
We were brought together by a clear flame,
Which shall never damp down—
And we steal luck away from no one,
But in young, rich love,
We embrace the Earth, the whole world.}}

Cerna's protest over the violent repression of the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|1907 revolt]] was lyricized in several contexts. In one such indignant piece, Cerna called on Peace not to arrive until the social issue would be solved.&lt;ref name="Călinescu_3"/&gt; In ''Zile de durere'', he appeals to the Sun to wash out the blood of peasant victims:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Usucă iute câmpurile roşii,
Să nu priceapă-n groapa lor strămoşii
Al cui a fost - şi cine l-a vărsat.}}&lt;ref name="Călinescu_3"/&gt;
|
Be quick to dry the red fields,
So that the ancestors in their graves could not grasp
Whose it was—and who it was that shed it.}}

==Legacy==
Panait Cerna's lifetime success and literary fame made him the target of adulation among his fellow traditionalists, a camp which united various ''Junimea'' affiliates and ''Sămănătorul'' contributors. According to Călinescu, this group saw him as Romania's answer to Schiller and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu_3"/&gt; ''Junimea'' saw in him one of its most important members of the early 20th century, while several historians note that he was so only because, at that stage, the literary society was declining.&lt;ref name="Ornea"/&gt; Mehedinţi's 1914 account of the ''Junimist'' promotion of the "original manifestations of Romanian culture" listed Cerna alongside [[Alexandru G. Florescu]] and other minor writers.&lt;ref name="Ornea_3"&gt;Ornea, p.78&lt;/ref&gt; Literary historian [[Z. Ornea]] argues that this evidenced not just a decline in standards, but also Mehedinţi's "tastelessness".&lt;ref name="Ornea_3"/&gt; Also according to Ornea, the association with Dragomirescu was also characteristic for the ''Junimist'' twilight, given that this circle had failed to impose "a new literary direction", and was tributary to the legacy of various traditionalist groups.&lt;ref name="Ornea_2"/&gt; At the same time, both Dragomirescu and his disciple [[Ion Trivale]] upheld him as a model to follow, equating him with the mid-19th century Classicist [[Grigore Alexandrescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;31–32, 84&lt;/ref&gt; Zarifopol deplores Cerna's submission to traditionalist and Classicist goals, arguing that it eventually ruined Cerna as a poet and made him unhappy.&lt;ref name="zarifartisti"/&gt;

The poet's adoption of a mainstream approach to poetry also pleased his public, and, Călinescu notes, schoolbooks of the day celebrated him as a Romanian classic while completely ignoring more controversial [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] such as Macedonski and [[Dimitrie Anghel]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu_3"/&gt; His contributions have helped shaped the style of 20th-century poets with traditionalist tendencies from different schools. Among them are the [[Socialism|socialist]] [[Alexandru Toma]],&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu, p.87&lt;/ref&gt; later known as an official poet of [[Communist Romania]], and ''Sămănătorul'' 's [[Ion Sân-Giorgiu]],&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu, p.67&lt;/ref&gt; whose career later took him through an [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] stage and eventually to [[Fascism|fascist]] politics. [[Demostene Botez]], another author to have been influenced by Cerna's style, dedicated his mentor a poem which read:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Un gigant ai fost pe-o lume plină numai cu pitici,
Un luceafăr singuratic între-atâţia licurici.}}&lt;ref name="Călinescu_3"/&gt;
|
A giant you have been in a world filled only with dwarfs,
A lonely evening star among so many fire flies.}}

In his essay ''Din registrul ideilor gingaşe'' ("From the Register of Gentle Ideas"), where he satirizes the Romanian public's reception of literature, Zarifopol looks into the problems faced by Cerna in satisfying his readers. Using one of Cerna's own accounts as the basis for this analysis, he notes that a group of his young "female admirers" where unpleasantly surprised to find out that their idol was "short, pudgy, wide-necked and ruddy-faced."&lt;ref name="zarifneint"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Zarifopol]], [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Din_registrul_ideilor_ginga%C5%9Fe:Ne%C3%AEn%C5%A3elegeri_inocente_%C3%AEntre_public_%C5%9Fi_arti%C5%9Fti ''Din registrul ideilor gingaşe: Neînţelegeri inocente între public şi artişti''] (wikisource)&lt;/ref&gt; He writes: "the girls&amp;nbsp;... were thus in full agreement with the philosophical tradition which, since the old days, has set as a supreme ideal a mosaic of perfections that is naive and unlikely."&lt;ref name="zarifneint"/&gt;

Like Lovinescu, other advocates of [[modernist literature]] rejected most of Cerna's contributions. One of the first to have done so is [[Ovid Densusianu]], who stated his belief that an artist's work should be separated from his life. Lovinescu, who commented on Densusianu and his thoughts on Cerna, opined that Densusianu had a tendency to reject all poets who registered popular success, and that he treated Dimitrie Anghel's work in much the same way.&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet's house in Cerna is presently a museum, dedicated in part to his memory, and also housing a permanent exhibit dedicated to the traditional arts and crafts of [[Tulcea County]].&lt;ref name="msdobr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcicemt"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://icem.romclub.ro/cerna.php ''Casa memorială Panait Cerna''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114000155/http://icem.romclub.ro/cerna.php |date=2007-11-14 }}, at the  [http://icem.romclub.ro/ Tulcea Institute for Environmental Studies and Museology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414200116/http://icem.romclub.ro/ |date=2008-04-14 }}; retrieved April 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It also features a bust of the poet.&lt;ref name="pcicemt"/&gt; The county library in [[Tulcea]] city is named after him,&lt;ref name="msdobr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjtulcea.ro/en/inst_subord/biblioteca.html ''"Panait Cerna" County Library''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201081601/http://www.cjtulcea.ro/en/inst_subord/biblioteca.html |date=2007-12-01 }}, official site; retrieved April 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; as are a high school in [[Brăila]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://harta.bdne.edu.ro/harta/unitate.html?idUnitateInvatamant=10013821&amp;limba=en The Panait Cerna High School], [http://rural.edu.ro/harta/?limba=en ''School Map'']{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} entry; hosted by the [[Minister of Education, Research and Youth (Romania)|Romanian Ministry of Education, Research and Youth]]; retrieved April 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and streets in Bucharest, Brăila, [[Bistriţa]], [[Hunedoara]], [[Lugoj]] and [[Petroşani]].

The '''Peripatetic axiom''' is: "Nothing is in the intellect that was not first in the senses"  (Latin: "''Nihil est in intellectu quod non sit prius in sensu''"). It is found in [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s ''De veritate, q. 2 a. 3 arg. 19''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas |title=Quaestiones disputatae de veritate|url=http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/qdv02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas adopted this principle from the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] school of [[Greek philosophy]], established by [[Aristotle]].

The '''Pontifical Academy of Archaeology''' (''Pontificia Accademia Romana di Archeologia'') is an academic [[Learned society|honorary society]] established in [[Rome]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] for the advancement of [[Christian]] [[archaeological]] study. It is one of the ten such [[Pontifical Academy|Pontifical Academies]] established by the [[Holy See]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/organizations/a10.htm GCath]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In the 17th century, [[Pope Benedict XIV]] responded to public and [[Catholic Church|Church]] interest in archaeology by establishing an association of students of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] archaeology. [[Antonio Bosio]]'s work on the [[catacombs]] had drawn the attention of international archaeologists to the early [[history of Christianity]]. 

In 1816 [[Pius VII]], on the recommendation of [[Cardinal Consalvi]], gave official recognition to the ''Accademia Romana di Archeologia'' and the academy became an important international centre of archaeological study. Its foreign members and lecturers included [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]], [[Johan David Åkerblad]], [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], as well as sovereigns [[Frederick William IV]] of [[Prussia]] and [[Charles Albert]] of [[Sardinia]]. [[Pope Pius VIII]] gave the Academy the title of "Pontifical Academy".

In 1833 an attempt was made to remove the tomb of [[Raphael]], but the Academy protested to [[Pope Gregory XVI]] and was successful. Later through the efforts of one of its members, the Academy was responsible for the restoration of the [[Tabularium]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]]. 
In the mid-19th century, the Academy became involved in a series of [[property rights]] disputes, as it hoped to prevent damage to monuments by restricting the rights of residents in low-cost housing near the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]]. It succeeded in obtaining from [[Pope Pius IX]] a decree for the demolition of the houses on the left side of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]; it also protested against the digging of new holes in the walls.

==Modern operations==

The Academy operates with the guidance and direction of the [[Pontifical Commission of Sacred Archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_commissions/archeo/inglese/documents/rc_com_archeo_pro_20011010_pcas_en.html Vatican, Pontifical Commission of Sacred Archaeology]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]] is the Academy's "protector" and overseer. It has a membership of 130 ordinary members, with further honorary, corresponding, and associate members. Its meetings are held in the palace of the [[Cancelleria Apostolica]]. The seal of the Academy represents the ruins of a classical temple, with the motto ''"In apricum proferet"'' – "It will bring to light." 

In July 2010 the Academy celebrated its 200th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romereports.com/palio/The-Pontifical-Academy-of-Archaeology-celebrates-its-200th-anniversary-english-2432.html Rome Reports – The Pontifical Academy of Archaeology celebrates its 200th anniversary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715203009/http://www.romereports.com/palio/The-Pontifical-Academy-of-Archaeology-celebrates-its-200th-anniversary-english-2432.html |date=2011-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public relations''' ('''PR''') is the practice of managing the spread of [[information]] between an individual or an [[organization]] (such as a business, government agency, or a nonprofit organization) and the [[General public|public]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Grunig|first1=James E|last2=Hunt|first2=Todd|title=Managing Public Relations|location=Orlando, FL|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|year=1984|edition= 6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public relations may include an organization or [[individual]] gaining [[publicity|exposure]] to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Seitel|first=Fraser P.|title=The Practice of Public Relations. |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|publisher= Pearson Prentice Hall|year= 2007|edition= 10th}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differentiates it from [[advertising]] as a form of [[marketing communications]]. Public relations is the idea of creating coverage for clients for free, rather than [[marketing]] or advertising. But now advertising is also a part of greater PR Activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/306758|title=#10 Important Trends in PR that You Can't Afford to Ignore|last=Singh|first=Honey|date=2017-12-29|work=Entrepreneur|access-date=2018-08-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of good public relations would be generating an article featuring a client, rather than paying for the client to be advertised next to the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = What You Need to Get a Job in Public Relations After College - AfterCollege|url = http://blog.aftercollege.com/2014/need-get-job-public-relations-college/#sthash.m6uq8xLi.dpuf|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of public relations is to inform the public, prospective customers, investors, partners, employees, and other stakeholders and ultimately persuade them to maintain a positive or favorable view about the organization, its [[leadership]], products, or political decisions. Public relations professionals typically work for PR and marketing firms, [[businesses]] and [[companies]], [[government]], and [[official|public officials]] as [[public information officer|PIOs]] and [[nongovernmental organizations]], and [[nonprofit organizations]]. Jobs central to public relations include account coordinator, account executive, account supervisor, and media relations manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Career Overview: Public Relations - Wetfeet.com|url = https://www.wetfeet.com/articles/career-overview-public-relations|accessdate = 2015-09-28|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150929184702/https://www.wetfeet.com/articles/career-overview-public-relations|archive-date = 29 September 2015|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public relations specialists establish and maintain relationships with an organisation's target [[audience]], the [[mass media|media]], relevant trade media, and other [[opinion leadership|opinion leaders]]. Common responsibilities include designing communications campaigns, writing [[press release|news releases]] and other content for [[news]], working with the [[News media|press]], arranging interviews for company spokespeople, writing [[speech]]es for company leaders, acting as an organisation's [[spokesperson]], preparing clients for [[press conferences]], media interviews and speeches, writing [[website]] and [[social media]] content, managing company reputation ([[crisis management]]), managing [[internal communications]],  and marketing activities like brand awareness and event management &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last= Rubel|first= Gina F.|title= Everyday Public Relations for Lawyers|location=Doylestown, PA|edition=  1st|year= 2007|isbn= 978-0-9801719-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Success in the field of public relations requires a deep understanding of the interests and concerns of each of the company's many stakeholders. The public relations professional must know how to effectively address those concerns using the most powerful tool of the public relations trade, which is publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Roos, Dave. "What Is Public Relations?" HowStuffWorks. N.p., 5 Apr. 2008. Web. 25 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
[[Ivy Lee]], the man who turned around the [[Rockefeller]] name and image, and his friend, [[Edward Bernays|Edward Louis Bernays]], established the first definition of public relations in the early 1900s as follows: "a management function, which tabulates public attitudes, defines the policies, procedures and interests of an organization... followed by executing a program of action to earn public understanding and acceptance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdhyJ_n1HFkC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;lpg=PR17&amp;dq=a+management+function,+which+tabulates+public+attitudes,+defines+the+policies,+procedures+and+interests+of+an+organization...+followed+by+executing+a+program+of+action+to+earn+public+understanding+and+acceptance.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tyoaqRfdcA&amp;sig=fyUEmNuDbztwXb891AgOkadYm3U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi71fbm2fTRAhVDylQKHajTAggQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20management%20function,%20which%20tabulates%20public%20attitudes,%20defines%20the%20policies,%20procedures%20and%20interests%20of%20an%20organization...%20followed%20by%20executing%20a%20program%20of%20action%20to%20earn%20public%20understanding%20and%20acceptance.&amp;f=false|title=PR 2.0: New Media, New Tools, New Audiences|last=Breakenridge|first=Deirdre|date=2008-03-26|publisher=FT Press|isbn=9780132703970|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when Lee was later asked about his role in a hearing with the [[United Transit Commission]], he said "I have never been able to find a satisfactory phrase to describe what I do."&lt;ref name="twoway"/&gt; In 1948, historian Eric Goldman noted that the definition of public relations in Webster's would be "disputed by both practitioners and critics in the field."&lt;ref name="twoway"&gt;{{cite book

According to Bernays, the public relations counsel is the agent working with both modern media of communications and group formations of society in order to provide ideas to the public’s consciousness. Furthermore, he is also concerned with ideologies and courses of actions as well as material goods and services and public utilities and industrial associations and large trade groups for which it secures popular support.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bernays, "The New Propagandists," in Propaganda, (New York: H. Liverlight, 1928), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1978, the World Assembly of Public Relations Associations defined the field as &lt;blockquote&gt;"the art and [[social science]] of analyzing [[fad|trends]], predicting their consequences, counseling organizational leaders and implementing planned programs of action, which will serve both the organization and the [[public interest]]."&lt;ref&gt;Jensen Zhao. Encyclopedia of Business, 2nd. Ed. Retrieved from  [https://archive.is/20120713012953/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5209/is_1999/ai_n19125848/ findarticles.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Public Relations Society of America]], a professional trade association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-470-14492-3|title=Special Events: The Roots and Wings of Celebration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0yxPHPj5CPMC&amp;pg=PA436}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined public relations in 1982 as: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Public relations helps an organization and its publics adapt mutually to each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prsa.org/AboutPRSA/PublicRelationsDefined/Old%20Definition|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304145356/http://www.prsa.org/AboutPRSA/PublicRelationsDefined/Old%20Definition|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-03-04|title=PRSA's Old Definition of Public Relations|first=Keith|last=Trivitt|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2011 and 2012, the PRSA solicited crowd supplied definitions for the term and allowed the public to vote on one of three finalists. The winning definition stated that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Public relations is a strategic communication process that builds mutually beneficial relationships between organizations and their publics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/business/media/public-relations-a-topic-that-is-tricky-to-define.html |author= Stuart Elliot| title=Public Relations Defined, After an Energetic Public Discussion|date=March 1, 2012|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Public relations can also be defined as the practice of managing [[communication]] between an organization and its publics.&lt;ref&gt;Grunig, James E. and Hunt, Todd. Managing Public Relations. (Orlando, FL: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1984), 6e. Public relations is what you do with what you know and what other think about what you say.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public relations is to speak out its advocacy  in public, and it builds up a talking platform to achieve its goals and protect the interests of people.&lt;ref name="good"&gt;{{cite web|last1=CPRS|title=CPRS {{!}} What is Public Relations?|url=http://www.cprs.ca/Aboutus/whatisPR.aspx|website=www.cprs.ca|accessdate=16 April 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417072546/http://www.cprs.ca/Aboutus/whatisPR.aspx|archive-date=17 April 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of public relations}}
Public relations is not a phenomenon of the 20th century, but rather has historical roots. Most textbooks consider the establishment of the Publicity Bureau in 1900 to be the founding of the public relations profession. However, academics have found early forms of public influence and communications management in ancient civilizations, during the settling of the [[New World]] and during the movement to abolish slavery in England. Basil Clark is considered the founder of public relations in the [[United Kingdom]] for his establishment of Editorial Services in 1924.

Propaganda was used by the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and others to rally for domestic support and demonize enemies during the World Wars, which led to more sophisticated commercial publicity efforts as public relations talent entered the private sector. Most historians believe public relations became established first in the US by [[Ivy Lee]] or [[Edward Bernays]], then spread internationally. Many American companies with PR departments spread the practice to Europe when they created European subsidiaries as a result of the [[Marshall plan]].

The second half of the 1900s is considered the professional development building era of public relations. Trade associations, PR news magazines, international PR agencies, and academic principles for the profession were established. In the early 2000s, press release services began offering social media press releases. [[The Cluetrain Manifesto]], which predicted the effect of social media in 1999, was controversial in its time, but by 2006, the effect of social media and new internet technologies became broadly accepted.

== Occupational Prospective ==
Public relations specialist is a job with potential as this specific sector is gauged to increase by 9% from 2016 to 2026, especially as social media usage increases and the need to react quickly after crises occur to continue to create and maintain a favorable public image for the organization they represent. Each sector, state, and job is paid and utilized differently which is why the United States Department of Labor broke down national estimates at each level for people to get a better idea of the job outlooks. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes273031.htm|title=Public Relations Specialists|website=www.bls.gov|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tactics ==
Public relations professionals present the face of an organization or individual, usually to articulate its objectives and official views on issues of relevance, primarily to the media. Public relations contributes to the way an organization is perceived by influencing the media and maintaining relationships with stakeholders. According to Dr. Jacquie L’Etang from Queen Margaret University, public relations professionals can be viewed as "discourse workers specializing in communication and the presentation of argument and employing [[rhetorical]] strategies to achieve managerial aims."&lt;ref name="L'Etang2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jacquie|last=L'Etang|title=Public Relations in Britain: A History of Professional Practice in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hEuTTo4lpTYC|accessdate=22 May 2013|date=2 September 2004|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-4106-1081-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific public relations disciplines include:
* Financial public relations – communicating financial results and business strategy
* [[Consumer]]/[[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] public relations – gaining publicity for a particular product or service
* [[Crisis communication]] – responding in a crisis
* [[Internal communications]] – communicating within the company itself
* [[Government relations]] – engaging government departments to influence public policy
* [[Media relations]] – a public relations function that involves building and maintaining close relationships with the news media so that they can sell and promote a business.
*Celebrity public relations− promotion of a celebrity to various media publications and outlets 
*In-house public relations – maintaining communication between entertainment networks/production companies and the media
* Food-centric relations – communicating specific information centered on foods, beverages and wine.

Building and managing relationships with those who influence an organization or individual’s audiences has a central role in doing public relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David|last=Phillips|year=2006|title=Towards relationship management: Public relations at the core of organizational development|journal=Journal of Communication Management|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kamau, C. (2009) [http://www.igi-global.com/bookstore/Chapter.aspx?TitleId=36662 Strategising impression management in corporations: cultural knowledge as capital]. In D. Harorimana (Ed) Cultural implications of knowledge sharing, management and transfer: identifying competitive advantage. Chapter 4. Information Science Reference. {{ISBN|978-1-60566-790-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a public relations practitioner has been working in the field, they accumulate a list of relationships that become an asset, especially for those in media relations.

Within each discipline, typical activities include [[pseudo-event|publicity events]], speaking opportunities, [[press releases]], [[newsletters]], [[blog]]s, [[social media]], press kits, and outbound communication to members of the press. Video and audio news releases (VNRs and ANRs) are often produced and distributed to TV outlets in hopes they will be used as regular program content.

=== Audience targeting ===
A fundamental technique used in public relations is to identify the [[target audience]] and to tailor messages to be relevant to each audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Target audience|title=Key concepts in public relations|page=227|first1=Bob|last1=Franklin|first2=Mike|last2=Hogan|first3=Quentin|last3=Langley|first4=Nick|last4=Mosdell|first5=Elliot|last5=Pill|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-2318-7|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the interests of differing audiences and stakeholders common to a public relations effort necessitate the creation of several distinct but complementary messages. These messages however should be relevant to each other, thus creating a consistency to the overall message and theme. Audience targeting tactics are important for public relations practitioners because they face all kinds of problems: low visibility, lack of public understanding, opposition from critics, and insufficient support from funding sources.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Ronald D. Strategic Planning for Public Relations. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] theory identifies people who have a stake in a given institution or issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Stakeholder Approach Revisited|first=R Edward|last=Freeman|year=2004|publisher=Rainer Hampp Verlag|volume=5|issue=3|journal=Zeitschrift für Wirtschafts- und Unternehmensethik}}&lt;/ref&gt; All audiences are stakeholders (or presumptive stakeholders), but not all stakeholders are audiences. For example, if a charity commissions a public relations agency to create an advertising campaign to raise money to find a cure for a disease, the [[charitable organization|charity]] and the people with the disease are stakeholders, but the audience is anyone who is likely to donate money. Public relations experts possess deep skills in media relations, market positioning, and branding. They are powerful agents that help clients deliver clear, unambiguous information to a target audience that matters to them.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Mark. "Climate Change and Public Relations." StarTribune.com: News, Weather, Sports from Minneapolis, St. Paul and Minnesota. Livefyre, 11 Aug. 2014. Web. 25 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Publics in Public Relations ===
The public is any group whose members have a common interest or common values in a particular subject, such as political party. Those members would then be considered stakeholders, which are people who have a stake or an interest in an organization or issue that potentially involves the organization or group they're interested in. The Publics in Public Relations are:

-'''''Traditional Publics''''': Groups with which you have an on-going and long term relationship with, this may include; Employees, Media, Governments, Investors, and Customers&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/660088137|title=Public relations : a values-driven approach|last=David.|first=Guth,|date=2012|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|others=Marsh, Charles, 1955-|isbn=9780205811809|edition= 5th|location=Boston|oclc=660088137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

-'''''Non-Traditional Publics''''': Groups that are typically unfamiliar with your organization and you have not had a relationship with but may become traditional publics due to changes in the organization, in society or if a group changing event occurs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Latent Publics''''': A group whose values have come into contact with the values of your organization but whose members haven't yet realized it; the members of that public are not yet aware of the relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Aware Publics''''': A group of members who are aware of the existence of a commonality of values or interests with your organization, but have not organized or attempted to respond to that commonality.

-'''''Intervening Publics''''': Any public that helps you send a message to another public, could be the media or someone with stature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Primary Publics:''''' If a public can directly affect your organization's pursuit of its values-driven goals. This publics would include media, employees, government, shareholder, financial institutions, and the immediate community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Secondary Publics''''': Have high interest in the company such as the primary publics but will not be directly affected by decisions of the organization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Internal Publics''''': People within your organization&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''External Publics''''': People outside of your organization&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Domestic Publics''''': Those within your country&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''-International Publics''''': Those outside of your country and when communicating with this publics you must be weary of that areas culture, beliefs, values, ethic, and other valuable cultural difference as to not offend anyone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Messaging ===
Messaging is the process of creating a consistent story around: a product, person, company, or service. Messaging aims to avoid having readers receive contradictory or confusing information that will instill doubt in their purchasing choices, or other decisions that affect the company. Brands aim to have the same problem statement, industry viewpoint, or brand perception shared across sources and media.

=== Social media marketing ===
{{Main|Digital marketing}}
Digital marketing is the use of [[Internet]] tools and technologies such as [[search engines]], Web 2.0 social bookmarking, [[new media]] relations, [[blogging]], and [[social media marketing]]. Interactive PR allows companies and organizations to disseminate information without relying solely on mainstream publications and communicate directly with the public, customers and prospects.

PR practitioners have always relied on the media  such as TV, radio, and magazines, to promote their ideas and messages tailored specifically to a target audience. Social media marketing is not only a new way to achieve that goal, it is also a continuation of a strategy that existed for decades. Lister et al. said that "Digital media can be seen as a continuation and extension of a principal or technique that was already in place".&lt;ref&gt;Lister, M., Dovey, J., Giddings, S., Grant, I., &amp; Kelly, K. (2009). New media: A critical introduction. (2nd ed.). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
PR professionals are well aware of the fact that digital technology is used in a practically different way than before. For instance, cellphones are no longer just devices we use to talk to one another. They are also used for online shopping, dating, learning and getting the most up to date news around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Tapscott, D. (2009). Grown up digital: How the net generation is changing your world. New York: McGraw hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

As digital technology has evolved, the methods to measure effective online public relations effectiveness have improved. The Public Relations Society of America, which has been developing PR strategies since 1947, identified 5 steps to measure online public relations effectiveness. 
# ''Engagement'': Measure the number of people who engaged with an item (social shares, likes and comments). 
# ''Impressions'': Measure the number of people who may have viewed an item.
# ''Items'': Measure any content (blog posts, articles, etc.) that originally appeared as digital media.
# ''Mentions'': Measure how many online items mention the brand, organization, or product.
# ''Reach'': Measure how far the PR campaign managed to penetrate overall and in terms of a particular audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prsa.org/Intelligence/BusinessCase/MeasurementStandarization/#.VdZtN1WrTmE|title=PR Measurement Standardization: Moving Toward Industry Agreement: PRSA|first=Arthur|last=Yann|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other techniques ===
[[Litigation public relations]] is the management of the communication process during the course of any legal dispute or adjudicatory processing so as to affect the outcome or its effect on the client’s overall [[reputation]] (Haggerty, 2003).

== Ethics ==
Public relations professionals both serve the public's interest and private interests of businesses, associations, non-profit organizations, and governments. This dual obligation gave rise to heated debates among scholars of the discipline and practitioners over its fundamental values. This conflict represents the main ethical predicament of public relations.&lt;ref name="Carolyn Bronstein 2006"&gt;Kathy Fitzpatrick and Carolyn Bronstein, " Introduction: Towards a Definitional Framework for Responsible Advocacy," in Ethics in Public Relations, Responsible Advocacy, ed. Kathy Fitzpatrick and Carolyn Bronstein (USA: Sage Publications, Inc. 2006), ix.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the [[Public Relations Society of America]] (PRSA) responded to the controversy by acknowledging in its new code of ethics "advocacy" – for the first time – as a core value of the discipline.&lt;ref name="Carolyn Bronstein 2006"/&gt;

The field of public relations is generally highly un-regulated, but many professionals voluntarily adhere to the code of conduct of one or more professional bodies to avoid exposure for ethical violations.&lt;ref name="Marshall2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=Tim|title=Ethics – Who needs them?|journal=Journal of Communication Management|volume=7|issue=2|year=2002|pages=107–112|issn=1363-254X|doi=10.1108/13632540310807313}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chartered Institute of Public Relations]], the Public Relations Society of America, and The Institute of Public Relations are a few organizations that publish an ethical code. Still, [[Edelman (firm)|Edelman]]'s 2003 semi-annual trust survey found that only 20 percent of survey respondents from the public believed paid communicators within a company were credible.&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1108/13632540510621498|title = Can the professionalisation of the UK public relations industry make it more trustworthy?| journal=Journal of Communication Management| volume=9| pages=56–64|year = 2005|last1 = Tobin|first1 = Natasha}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public relations people are growing increasingly concerned with their company’s marketing practices, questioning whether they agree with the company’s social responsibility. They seek more influence over marketing and more of a counseling and policy-making role. On the other hand, marketing people are increasingly interested in incorporating publicity as a tool within the realm marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Kermani, Faiz and Alan Needham. Marketing and Public Relations. Marlow: Institute of Clinical Research, 2006. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Scott Cutlip, the social justification for public relations is the right for an organization to have a fair hearing of their point of view in the public forum, but to obtain such a hearing for their ideas requires a skilled advocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Scott|last=Cutlip|author-link=Scott Cutlip|year=1994|title=The Unseen Power: Public Relations: A History|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|isbn=978-0-8058-1464-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public Relation Code of Ethics: ===
The Public Relation Student Society of America has established a set of fundamental guidelines that people within the public relations professions should practice and use in their business atmosphere. These values are:

'''''Advocacy''''': Serving the public interest by acting as responsible advocates for the clientele. This can occur by displaying the marketplace of ideas, facts, and viewpoints to aid informed public debate.

'''''Honesty''''': Standing by the truth and accuracy of all facts in the case and advancing those statements to the public.

'''''Expertise''''': To become and stay informed of the specialized knowledge needed in the field of Public Relations. Taking that knowledge and improving the field through development, research, and education. Meanwhile professionals also build their understanding, credibility, and relationships to understand various audiences and industries.

'''''Independence''''': Provide unbiased work to those that are represented while being accountable for all actions.

'''''Loyalty''''': Stay devoted to your client while remembering you have a duty to still serve the public interest.

'''''Fairness''''': Honorably conduct business with any and all clients, employers, competitors, peers, vendors, media, and general public. Respecting all opinions and right of free expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prsa.org/ethics/code-of-ethics/|title=Code of Ethics - Public Relations Society of America|work=Public Relations Society of America|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spin ===
{{Main|Spin (public relations)}}
Spin has been interpreted historically to mean overt deceit that is meant to manipulate the public, but since the 1990s has shifted to describing a "polishing of the truth."&lt;ref name="Safire96"/&gt; Today, spin refers to providing a certain interpretation of information meant to sway public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/spin|title=spin|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies may use spin to create the appearance of the company or other events are going in a slightly different direction than they actually are.&lt;ref name="Safire96"&gt;Safire, William
(1996) [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/22/magazine/the-spinner-spun.html?scp=19&amp;sq=spin%20definition&amp;st=cse ''The Spinner Spun'']&lt;/ref&gt; Within the field of public relations, spin is seen as a derogatory term, interpreted by professionals as meaning blatant deceit and manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://donhalepr.com/?p=163 Spin Doctor a Derogatory Term That Needs to Go, Dilenschneider Says]. Don Hale PR. Retrieved on 2013-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.prnewswire.com/2012/02/17/dear-gracie-is-flack-a-four-letter-word/ Dear Gracie: Is ‘Flack’ a Four-Letter Word? | Beyond PR]. Blog.prnewswire.com (2012-02-17). Retrieved on 2013-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Skilled practitioners of spin are sometimes called "spin doctors."

In Stuart Ewen’s ''PR! A Social History of Spin'', he argues that public relations can be a real menace to democracy as it renders the public discourse powerless. Corporations are able to hire public relations professionals and transmit their messages through the media channels and exercise a huge amount of influence upon the individual who is defenseless against such a powerful force. He claims that public relations is a weapon for capitalist deception and the best way to resist is to become media literate and use critical thinking when interpreting the various mediated messages.&lt;ref&gt;W. Timothy Coombs and Sherry J. Holladay, "Does Society Need Public Relations? Criticisms of Public Relations" in It’s Not Just PR: Public Relations in Society, (Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2007), 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The techniques of spin include selectively presenting facts and quotes that support ideal positions ([[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]]), the so-called "[[non-denial denial]]," phrasing that in a way presumes unproven truths, [[euphemism]]s for drawing attention away from items considered distasteful, and ambiguity in public statements. Another spin technique involves careful choice of timing in the release of certain news so it can take advantage of prominent events in the news.

=== Negative ===
{{see also|Negative campaigning}}
Negative public relations, also called dark public relations (DPR) and in some earlier writing "Black PR", is a process of destroying the target's reputation and/or [[corporate identity]]. The objective in DPR is to discredit someone else, who may pose a threat to the client's business or be a political rival. DPR may rely on [[IT security]], [[industrial espionage]], [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]], and [[competitive intelligence]]. Common techniques include using dirty secrets from the target, producing misleading facts to fool a competitor.&lt;ref&gt;Wattenberg, Martin P. (22 Aug. 1996). Negative Campaign Advertising: Demobilizer or Mobilizer. eScholarship Repository. UC Irvine, Department of Politics and Society. Retrieved on 29 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bike, William S.

Public relations are frequently just recycled information used by a plethora of sources, thus giving way to minimal perspectives regarding events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uk-engage.org/2013/08/what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-using-a-proportional-representation-pr-electoral-system/|title=Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of A PR Electoral System {{!}} UK Engage|website=www.uk-engage.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-04|date=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics and civil society ===
In ''Propaganda'' (1928), Bernays argued that the manipulation of public opinion was a necessary part of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/EdwardLBernays-Propaganda Edward Bernays ''Propaganda'' (1928) p. 10]&lt;/ref&gt; In public relations, [[lobby groups]] are created to influence government policy, corporate policy or [[public opinion]], typically in a way that benefits the sponsoring organization.

In fact, Bernays stresses that we are in fact dominated in almost every aspect of our lives, by a relatively small number of persons who have mastered the ‘mental processes and social patterns of the masses,’ which include our behavior, political and economic spheres or our morals.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bernays, "Organizing Chaos," in Propaganda, (New York: H. Liverlight, 1928), 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, each individual chooses his own opinion on behavior and public issues. However, in practice, it is impossible for one to study all variables and approaches of a particular question and come to a conclusion without any external influence. This is the reason why the society has agreed upon an ‘invisible government’ to interpret on our behalf information and narrow the choice field to a more practical scale.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bernays, "Organizing Chaos," in Propaganda, (New York: H. Liverlight, 1928), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

When a lobby group hides its true purpose and support base, it is known as a [[front group]].&lt;ref&gt;See Peter Viggo Jakobsen, ''Focus on the CNN Effect Misses the Point: The Real Media Impact on Conflict Management is Invisible and Indirect'', Journal of Peace Research, vol.37, no.2. Institute of Political Science, University of Copenhagen (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Front groups are a form of [[astroturfing]], because they intend to sway the public or the government without disclosing their financial connection to corporate or political interests. They create a fake grass-roots movement by giving the appearance of a trusted organization that serves the public, when they actually serve their sponsors.

Politicians also employ public relations professionals to help project their views, policies, and even personalities to their best advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=On the Record: Politics, Politicians and Power|first=Laurie|last=Oakes|page=191|year=2010|publisher=Hachette Australia|isbn=978-0-7336-2700-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purana taught a theory of "non-action" ([[Pāli]], [[Sanskrit|Skt.]]: ''akiriyāvāda'') whereby the body acts independent of the soul, merit or demerit.&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskar (1972).  [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:558.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 215, entry for "Kiriya"] succinctly defines ''akiriyavāda'' as: "denying the difference between merit &amp; demerit."&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Pali Canon]], Purana (along with the ascetic [[Makkhali Gosala]]) is identified as an ''ahetuvadin'', "denier of a cause" (of [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskar (1972).  See [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.4:1:708.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 733, entry for "Hetu"] for a translation of ''ahetu-vādin'' as: "denier of a cause."&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of Purana's beliefs, in the [[Samannaphala Sutta]] ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 2) it is reported that Purana said:
:"...[I]n acting or getting others to act, in mutilating or getting others to mutilate, in torturing or getting others to torture, in inflicting sorrow or in getting others to inflict sorrow, in tormenting or getting others to torment, in intimidating or getting others to intimidate, in taking life, taking what is not given, breaking into houses, plundering wealth, committing burglary, ambushing highways, committing adultery, speaking falsehood — one does no evil. If with a razor-edged disk one were to turn all the living beings on this earth to a single heap of flesh, a single pile of flesh, there would be no evil from that cause, no coming of evil. Even if one were to go along the right bank of the Ganges, killing and getting others to kill, mutilating and getting others to mutilate, torturing and getting others to torture, there would be no evil from that cause, no coming of evil. Even if one were to go along the left bank of the Ganges, giving and getting others to give, making sacrifices and getting others to make sacrifices, there would be no merit from that cause, no coming of merit. Through generosity, self-control, restraint, and truthful speech there is no merit from that cause, no coming of merit.'&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anguttara Nikaya]] also reports that Purana claimed to be omniscient.  The [[Dhammapada]] commentary claims that Purana committed suicide by drowning.&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskar (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pythagorean.Hammers.png|thumb|right|Pythagorean hammers.]]
According to legend, [[Pythagoras]] discovered the foundations of [[musical tuning]] by listening to the sounds of four [[blacksmith]]'s hammers, which produced [[consonance and dissonance]] when they were struck simultaneously. According to [[Nicomachus]] in his 2nd century CE ''[[Enchiridion harmonices]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Piero, and Richard Taruskin, eds. ''Music in the Western World: A History in Documents''. 2nd ed. N.p.: Thomson Schirmer, 1984. 3. {{ISBN|9780534585990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Pythagoras noticed that hammer A produced consonance with hammer B when they were struck together, and hammer C produced consonance with hammer A, but hammers B and C produced dissonance with each other. Hammer D produced such perfect consonance with hammer A that they seemed to be "singing" the same note. Pythagoras rushed into the blacksmith shop to discover why, and found that the explanation was in the weight ratios. The hammers weighed 12, 9, 8, and 6 pounds respectively. Hammers A and D were in a ratio of 2:1, which is the ratio of the [[octave]]. Hammers B and C weighed 9 and 8 pounds. Their ratios with hammer A were (12:9 = 4:3 = [[perfect fourth]]) and (12:8 = 3:2 = [[perfect fifth]]). The space between B and C is a ratio of 9:8, which is equal to the musical [[major second|whole tone]], or whole step [[interval (music)|interval]] ({{audio-nohelp|Major tone on C.mid|Play 9/8}}).

The legend is, at least with respect to the hammers, demonstrably false. It is probably a Middle Eastern folk tale.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Sylvan Guthrie, David R. Fideler (1987). ''The Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library: An Anthology of Ancient Writings which Relate to Pythagoras and Pythagorean Philosophy'', p.24. Red Wheel/Weiser. {{ISBN|9780933999510}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These proportions are indeed relevant to [[strings (music)|string]] length (e.g. that of a [[monochord]]) — using these founding intervals, it is possible to construct the [[chromatic scale]] and the basic seven-tone [[diatonic scale]] used in modern music, and Pythagoras might well have been influential in the discovery of these proportions  (hence, sometimes referred to as [[Pythagorean tuning]]) — but the proportions do not have the same relationship to hammer weight and the tones produced by them.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, Thomas, ed. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ioa9uW2t7AQC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=pythagoras+hammers+myth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wtLXShWfVQ&amp;sig=LlyPLjIoE0O25ieAj9-2h7J1Qq8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=itsgTduSB8L7lwf6os3UCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=pythagoras%20hammers%20myth&amp;f=false The Cambridge history of Western music theory]''.

Cited in Christensen 2002, p.143.&lt;/ref&gt; However, hammer-driven [[chisel]]s with equal cross-section, show an exact proportion between length or weight and [[Eigenfrequency]].&lt;ref&gt;Markus Bautsch: [http://www.mater-dolorosa-lankwitz.de/wiki/doku.php/musik:ueber_die_pythagoreischen_wurzeln_der_gregorianischen_moden Über die pythagoreischen Wurzeln der gregorianischen Modi], English: ''About the Pythagorean roots of the [[Gregorian modes]]'', [[Mater Dolorosa (Berlin-Lankwitz)]], March 2012, retrieved on 31 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier sources mention Pythagoras' interest in harmony and ratio. [[Xenocrates]] (4th century BCE), while not as far as we know mentioning the blacksmith story, described Pythagoras' interest in general terms: "Pythagoras discovered also that the intervals in music do not come into being apart from number; for they are an interrelation of quantity with quantity. So he set out to investigate under what conditions concordant intervals come about, and discordant ones, and everything well-attuned and ill-tuned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barker|first=|editor=Andrew|title=Greek musical writings|date=2004|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-61697-3|page=30|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the details of the discovery of the relationship between music and ratio, it is regarded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lucas N.H.

''The Jewish Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt; Attributed or dedicated to [[Asaph the Jew|Asaph the Physician]] (also known as Asaph ben Berechiah; possibly a [[History of the Jews in the Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Jew]]&lt;ref&gt;Holo, J. Byzantine Jewry in the Mediterranean Economy 2009, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;; or possibly identifiable with [[Asif ibn Barkhiya]], a legendary mystical polymath vizier in Arabic folklore, associated with [[King Solomon]]) and one Yoḥanan ben Zabda, who may have lived in [[History of Palestine#Byzantine period|Byzantine Palestine]] or [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]] between the 3rd and 6th Centuries CE (though this is very uncertain, and some have suggested that Asaph and Yoḥanan were both legendary sages in Jewish tradition, to whom the text was dedicated; not its literal authors)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/sfhm/hsm/HSMx1982x017xspec1/HSMx1982x017xspec1x0248.pdf|&lt;i&gt;The Hebrew "Book of Medicines" attributed to Asaf the physician: an early mediaeval encyclopaedia of Greek medicine based on an Indian model.&lt;/i&gt; Lieber E. Hist Sci Med. 1982&lt;/ref&gt;. The date of the text is uncertain, with most manuscripts coming from the late medieval era; though the lack of Arabian medical knowledge in the book implies it may have originally been written much earlier.

==Content==
Sefer Refuot discusses [[illness]]es, treatments and prevention. It shows great interest in general fitness and wellbeing through regimens of regular exercise, eating healthy food, and personal hygiene. The book shows concern for providing medicine for the poor and an interest in fostering medicine as a distinct profession. It gives a theory of blood vessels and circulation. The book also prescribes different remedies for each month of the year, based on the believed effects that astrology had upon the body's [[Humorism|humors]]. The introduction to the book is in the form of the later Midrash, and ascribes the origin of medicine to [[Shem]], who received it from [[Angels in Judaism|angels]].

The work notably includes the ''Oath of Asaph'', a [[code of conduct]] for [[Jewish]] [[physician]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www1.umn.edu/phrm/oaths/oath5.html | title = Oath of Asaph | accessdate = 2007-06-19 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042841/http://www1.umn.edu/phrm/oaths/oath5.html | archivedate = 2016-03-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; strongly resembling the [[Hippocratic Oath]].&lt;ref name="Rosner1995"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.si/books?id=SL34EWxAJfYC&amp;pg=PA183 |chapter=Oath of Asaph |title=Medicine in the Bible and the Talmud: Selections from Classical Jewish Sources |first=Fred |last=Rosner |publisher=KTAV Publishing House |year=1995 |isbn=9780881255065 |pages=182–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was taken by medical students at their graduation.&lt;ref name="Bioethics2004"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3402500546/oath-asaph.html |title=Oath of Asaph |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Bioethics |year=2004 |publisher=The Gale Group Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Oath of Asaph'' text==

# This is the pact which Asaph ben Berakhyahu and Yoḥanan ben Zabda made with their pupils, and they adjured them with the following words:
# Do not attempt to kill any soul by means of a potion of herbs, 
# Do not make a woman [who is] pregnant [as a result] of whoring take a drink with a view to causing abortion, 
# Do not covet beauty of form in women with a view to fornicating with them, 
# Do not divulge the secret of a man who has trusted you, 
# Do not take any reward [which may be offered in order to induce you]  to destroy and to ruin, 
# Do not harden your heart [and turn it away] from pitying the poor and healing the needy, 
# Do not say of [what is] good; it is bad, nor of [what is] bad: it is good, 
# Do not adopt the ways of the sorcerers using [as they do] charms, augury and sorcery in order to separate a man from the wife of his bosom or a woman from the companion of her youth, 
# You shall not covet any wealth or reward [which may be offered in order to induce you]  to help in a lustful desire, 
# You shall not seek help in any idolatrous [worship] so as to heal through [a recourse to idols], and you shall not heal with anything [pertaining] to their worship, 
# But on the contrary detest and abhor and hate all those who worship them, put their trust in them, and give assurance [referring] to them, 
# For they are all naught, useless, for they are nothing, demons, spirits of the dead; they cannot help their own corpses, how then could they help those who live? 
# Now [then] put your trust in the Lord, your God, [who is] a true God, a living God, 
# For [it is] He who kills and makes alive, who wounds and heals, 
# Who teaches men knowledge and also to profit, 
# Who wounds with justice and righteousness, and who heals with pity and compassion, 
# No designs of [His] sagacity are beyond His [power] 
# And nothing is hidden from His eyes. 
# Who causes curative plants to grow, 
# Who puts sagacity into the hearts of the wise in order that they should heal through the abundance of His loving-kindness, and that they should recount wonders in the congregation of many; so that every living [being] knows that He made him and that there is no saviour [other] than He. 
# For the nations trust in their idols, who [are supposed] to save them from their distress and will not deliver them from their misfortunes 
# For their trust and hope is in the dead. 
# For this [reason] it is fitting to keep yourselves separate from them; to remove yourselves and keep far away from all the abominations of their idols, 
# And to cleave to the name of the Lord God of spirits for all flesh, 
# And the soul of every living being is in His hand to kill and to make live, 
# And there is none that can deliver out of His hand. 
# Remember Him always and seek Him in truth, in righteousness in an upright way, in order that you should prosper in all your works 
# And He will give you help to make you prosper in [what you are doing], and you shall be [said to be] happy in the mouth of all flesh. 
# And the nations will abandon their idols and images and will desire to worship God like you, 
# For they will know that their trust is in vain and their endeavor fruitless, 
# For they implore a god, who will not do good [to them], who will not save [them]. 
# As for you, be strong, do not let your hands be weak, for your work shall be rewarded, 
# The Lord is with you, while you are with Him, 
# If you keep His pact, follow His commandments, cleaving to them, 
# You will be regarded as His saints in the eyes of all flesh, and they will say: 
# Happy the people whose [lot] is such, happy the people whose God is the Lord. 
# Their pupils answered saying: 
# We will do all that you exhorted and ordered us [to do], 
# For it is a commandment of the Torah, 
# And we must do it with all our heart, with all our soul and with all our might, To do and to obey 
# Not to swerve or turn aside to the right hand or the left 
# And they [Asaph and Yohanan] blessed them in the name of God most high, maker of heaven and earth. 
# And they continued to charge them, and said: 
# The Lord God, His saints and His Torah [bear] witness, that you should fear Him, that you should not turn aside from His commandments, and that you should follow His laws with an upright heart, 
# You shall not incline after lucre [so as] to help a godless [man in shedding] innocent blood. 
# You shall not mix a deadly drug for any man or woman so that he [or she] should kill their fellow-man. 
# You shall not speak of the herbs [out of which such drugs are made]. You shall not hand them over to any man, 
# And you shall not talk about any matter [connected] with this, 
# You shall not use blood in any work of medicine, 
# You shall not attempt to provoke an ailment in a human soul through [the use of] iron instruments or searing with fire before making an examination two or three times; then [only] should you give your advice. 
# You shall not be ruled - your eyes and your heart being lifted up - by a haughty spirit. 
# Do not keep [in your hearts] the vindictiveness of hatred with regard to a sick man, 
# You shall not change your words in anything, 
# The Lord our God hates [?] [this?] being done, 
# But keep His orders and commandments, and follow all His ways, in order to please Him, [and] to be pure, true and upright. 
# Thus did Asaph and Yohanan exhort and adjure their pupils.

{{Zen Buddhism}}

{{nihongo|'''''Shōbōgenzō'''''|正法眼蔵||extra=lit. "Treasury of the True Dharma Eye"}} is the title most commonly used to refer to the collection of works written in Japanese by the 13th century Japanese Buddhist monk and founder of the Japanese [[Sōtō]] Zen school, [[Eihei Dōgen]]. Several other works exist with the same title (see above), and it is sometimes called the '''''Kana Shōbōgenzō''''' in order to differentiate it from those. The term shōbōgenzō can also more generally as a synonym for the [[Buddha Dharma]] as viewed from the perspective of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism.

==Source of the Title==

===Shōbōgenzō as a General Term===
In [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]] the term ''True Dharma Eye Treasury'' ({{CJKV|j=Shōbōgenzō}}) refers generally to the Buddha Dharma, and in [[Zen]] Buddhism, it specifically refers to the realization of Buddha's awakening that is not contained in the written words of the [[Sūtra|sutras]].

In general Buddhist usage, the term "treasury of the Dharma" refers to the written words of the Buddha's teaching collected in the Sutras as the middle of the [[Three Jewels|Three Treasures]] of the Buddha, Dharma, and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]. In Zen, however, the real treasure of the Dharma is not to be found in books but in one's own [[Buddha Nature]] and the ability to see this [[Right view|Correct View]] (first of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]) of the treasure of Dharma is called the "Treasure of the Correct Dharma Eye".

In the legends of the Zen tradition, the Shōbōgenzō has been handed down from teacher to student going all the way back to the Buddha when he transmitted the Shobogenzo to his disciple [[Mahākāśyapa]] thus beginning the Zen lineage that [[Bodhidharma]] brought to China.

The legend of the transmission of the Shōbōgenzō to Mahākāśyapa is found in several Zen texts and is one of the most referred to legends in all the writings of Zen.  Among the famous koan collections, it appears as Case 6 in the [[Wumenguan]] (''The Gateless Checkpoint'') and Case 2 in the [[Denkoroku]] (''Transmission of Light'').  In the legend as told in the Wumenguan, the Buddha holds up a flower and no one in the assembly responds except for [[Arya]] [[Mahākāśyapa|Kashyapa]] who gives a broad smile and laughs a little. Seeing Mahākāśyapa's smile the Buddha said, &lt;blockquote&gt;
''I possess the Treasury of the Correct Dharma Eye, the wonderful heart-mind of Nirvana, the formless true form, the subtle Dharma gate, not established by written words, transmitted separately outside the teaching.  I hand it over and entrust these encouraging words to Kashyapa.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Dahui's Shōbōgenzō and Dōgen's Shinji Shōbōgenzō===
[[Dahui Zonggao]], the famous 12th century popularizer of koans in [[Song Dynasty]] China, wrote a collection of kōans with the Chinese title ''[[Zhengfa Yanzang]]'' (正法眼藏). In Japanese this is read as ''Shōbōgenzō'', using the same [[kanji]] for its title as Dōgen's later work. When Dōgen visited China in 1223, he first studied under [[Wuji Lepai]], a disciple of Dahui, which is where he probably first came into contact with Dahui's ''Zhengfa Yanzang''. In his book ''Dogen's Manuals of Zen Meditation'', the modern scholar [[Carl Bielefeldt]] acknowledges that Dōgen likely took the title from Dahui for his own kōan collection, known now as the [[Shinji Shōbōgenzō]]. He later used the same title again for what is now his most well known work, the Kana Shōbōgenzō (now almost always referred to simply as "the Shōbōgenzō"): &lt;blockquote&gt; Indeed the fact that Dōgen styled his effort "Shōbō genzō" suggests that he had as his model a similar compilation of the same title by the most famous of Sung masters, Ta-Hui Tsung-kao [Dahui Zonggao]. Unlike the latter, Dōgen was content here simply to record the stories without interjecting his own remarks. A few years later, however, he embarked on a major project to develop extended commentaries on many of these and other passages from the Ch'an literature. The fruit of this project was his masterpiece--the remarkable collection of essays known as the kana, or "vernacular", Shōbō genzō.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Dogen's Manuals of Zen Meditation|last=Bielefeldt|first=Carl|page=46|publisher=University of California Press|place=Berkeley, Los Angeles, London|ISBN=0-520-06835-1|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Compilation of the Shōbōgenzō==

The different component texts&amp;mdash;referred to as fascicles&amp;mdash;of the Kana Shōbōgenzō were written between 1231 and 1253&amp;mdash;the year of Dōgen's death (Dōgen, 2002, p. xi). Unlike most Zen writings originating in [[Japan]] at that time, including Dōgen's own [[Shinji Shōbōgenzō]] and [[Eihei Koroku]], which were written in [[Classical Chinese]], the ''Kana Shōbōgenzō'' was written in Japanese. The essays in Shōbōgenzō were delivered as [[sermon]]s in a less formal style than the Chinese language sermons of the [[Eihei Koroku]]. Some of the fascicles were recorded by Dōgen, while others were recorded by his [[Śrāvaka|disciples]].

Dōgen rearranged the order of the fascicles that make up the Shōbōgenzō several times during his own lifetime, and also edited the content of individual fascicles. After his death, various editors added and removed fascicles to make different versions of the Shōbōgenzō. In pre-modern times there were four major versions that consisted of 60, 75, 12, and 28 fascicles, with the 60 fascicle version being the earliest and the 28 fascicle version the latest. The first two were arranged by Dōgen himself, with the 75 fascicle version containing several fascicles that had been edited from the earlier 60 fascicle version. Several copies of both the 60 and 75 fascicle versions exist, including one containing Dōgen's handwriting and that of his student, [[Koun Ejō]]. On the other hand, the 12 fascicle version, also known as the Yōkōji manuscript after the temple where it was found in 1936, is known from only two examples, one copied in 1420 and the other recopied from that in 1446. This version contains 5 fascicles not found in the older versions, including the only surviving manuscript of ''Ippyakuhachi Hōmyō Mon'''. It also contains a note at the end  of ''Hachi Dainin Gaku'' written by Koun Ejō indicating that it was to be the last fascicle of a 100 fascicle version; this was never completed due to Dōgen's illness near the end of his life. It is unclear which chapters this 100 fascicle version would have included and in what order. Finally, the 28 fascicle version, also known as the [[Eihei-ji]] manuscript or the "Secret Shōbōgenzō" ({{CJKV|j=Himitsu Shōbōgenzō}}), dates from the mid-1300's and actually only contains 26 fascicle because ''Shin Fukatoku'' appears twice and ''Butsudō'' is included twice in two different versions. The fascicles of the Eihei-ji manuscript were taken from the 75 and 12 fascicle versions and still retain the numbering system used from their source collections. ''Yoibutsu Yobutsu'' is an exception and is numbered as fascicle 38, which does not correspond to any extant version.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bodiford|first=William M.|editor-last=Heine|editor-first=Steven|isbn=9780199754472|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Dogen: Textual and Historical Studies|contribution=Textual Genealogies of Dōgen|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other pre-modern versions of the Shōbōgenzō exist, all of which were rearrangements of the four main versions discussed above, often with additional material from Dōgen that he did not intend to include. [[Bonsei]], who died in the early 15th century, created an 84 fascicle version consisting of the 75 fascicle version plus 9 books from the 60 fascicle version. Four copies of Bonsei's collection survive, with the oldest dating from 1644. An 89 fascicle version called the Daijōji manuscript was put together in 1689 by [[Manzan Dōhaku]] based on Bonsei's version of 84 plus 5 additional fascicles, including ''[[Bendōwa]]'', ''Jūundō Shiki'', and ''Jikuin Mon'', which were not previously considered part of the Shōbōgenzō. He also ordered the books based on the date they were written and not on the order Dōgen intended, suggest he likely believed the ordering was a later decision not made by Dōgen himself. [[Hangyo Kōzen]], aiming to make the most comprehensive version of the Shōbōgenzō, compiled a 96 fascicle version called the [[Komazawa University]] Library manuscript containing every known book from previous versions except ''Ippyakuhachi Hōmyō Mon''. It also included more additional writings, including the [[apocryphal]] ''Chinzo'' and several variant versions of other chapters. Kōzen's version became the basis for the first printed version of the Shōbōgenzō, the Honzan edition. Finally, a 78 book version was made by Tenkei Denson while he was preparing his commentary, ''Benchū'', on the text. He thought that the 60 fascicle version was compiled by [[Giun]] and was the oldest, most correct version, and as result his version is identical for the first 59 fascicles except for two replacements from other versions and one combination of two fascicles into one. The remainder is added from the 12 and 75 fascicle versions with 10 fascicles from those being specifically excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bodiford|first=William M.|editor-last=Heine|editor-first=Steven|isbn=9780199754472|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Dogen: Textual and Historical Studies|contribution=Textual Genealogies of Dōgen|pages=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern editions of Shōbōgenzō contain 95 fascicles based on the late 17th century 96 fascicle version of Hangyo Kozen, the 35th abbot of Dōgen's monastery [[Eihei-ji]]. This began as a 90 fascicle version, the first to be printed on woodblocks rather than hand copied, beginning in 1815 and known as the ''Honzan'' edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Dōgen|editor-last=Tanahashi|editor-first=Kazuaki|title=Moon in a Dewdrop: Writings of Zen Master Dogen|publisher=North Point Press|place=San Francisco|ISBN=0-86547-185-1|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six fascicles that were removed included the inauthentic ''Chinzo'' as well as five chapters regarded as secrets of the Sōtō School.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bodiford|first=William M.|editor-last=Heine|editor-first=Steven|isbn=9780199754472|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Dogen: Textual and Historical Studies|contribution=Textual Genealogies of Dōgen|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original woodblocks are now stored at [[Eihei-ji]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Dogen|editor-last=Nishijima|editor-first=Gudo Wafu|editor2-last=Cross|editor2-first=Chodo|title=Master Dogen's Shobogenzo|publisher=Windbell Publications|place=London|ISBN= 0-9523002-1-4|year=1994|volume=1|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906 the revised Honzan version of 95 fascicles including the five "secret" chapters was published. The only chapter originally intended to be part of the Shōbōgenzō missing from the revised Honzan version at this stage was ''Ippyakuhachi Hōmyō Mon'' because it was not discovered until 1936. In 1929, the ''Sōtōshū Zensho'' edition was released adding back ''Chinzo''. It was removed again in a revised edition in 1970, and then added again in the 1974 ''Zoku Sōtōshū Zensho'' along with ''Ippyakuhachi Hōmyō Mon''. Many other versions were made in the 20th century, some of which indiscriminately combined sections from different manuscripts. Today, arguably the most faithful printed version in Japanese is the 1988 edition compiled by Kōdō Kawamura consisting of the original 75 fascicle version from the single 1547 Ryūmonji manuscript, the 12 fascicle 1446 Yōkōji manuscript, nine uncollected works not originally intended for the Shōbōgenzō, and initial drafts of seven chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bodiford|first=William M.|editor-last=Heine|editor-first=Steven|isbn=9780199754472|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Dogen: Textual and Historical Studies|contribution=Textual Genealogies of Dōgen|pages=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Textual Analysis==
For centuries, all of Dōgen's work, including the Shōbōgenzō, was known only to a very small number of monks. Beginning in the 1700s, a movement began to reform the [[Sōtō]] school of Zen that Dōgen had founded half a millennium earlier. Specifically, monks such as Manzan Dōhaku sought to remove influences from other Zen schools and return practice back to the way they believed it would have been during Dōgen's time. One of the earliest commentaries on the Shōbōgenzō was in opposition to the movement by Tenkei. Using the 60 fascicle version, he harshly criticized the text and made his own revisions. This version was soon denounced by the [[Sōtō]] School. Around the same time [[Menzan Zuihō]] was dedicating much of his life to analyzing the Shōbōgenzō in order to uncover Dōgen's source material. Menzan's student Fuzan and his students put this extensive study into writing in the 1770s. Within a few years the monk Honkō made a commentary on the text and translated it into what was at the time the more respectable language of Classical Chinese. Commentaries were also made by the monks Zōkai and Rōran. An abridged collection of a variety of Dōgen's work appeared at this time called ''The Record of Eihei Dogen'', which the famous poet [[Ryōkan]] wrote a verse on.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Dōgen|editor-last=Tanahashi|editor-first=Kazuaki|title=Moon in a Dewdrop: Writings of Zen Master Dogen|publisher=North Point Press|place=San Francisco|ISBN=0-86547-185-1|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English Translations==
The ''Dōgen Zenji Zenshu'' contains all 95 Japanese fascicles, untranslated. There are now four complete [[English language|English]] translations of the ''Kana Shobogenzo''. A translation by [[Gudo Wafu Nishijima|Gudo Nishijima]] and Chodo Cross is available under two titles, ''Master Dogen's Shobogenzo'' and ''Shōbōgenzō: The True Dharma-Eye Treasury''. The latter is freely distributed digitally by Bukkyo Dendo Kyokai (BDK) with many other [[Mahāyāna]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Texts|url=http://www.bdk.or.jp/bdk/digitaldl.html|publisher=Bukkyo Dendo Kyokai (BDK)|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kosen Nishiyama and John Stevens have a translation titled ''Shobogenzo (The Eye and Treasury of the True Law)''. [[Shasta Abbey]] has a free digital translation of the Shobogenzo and offers other Soto Zen works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SHOBOGENZO The Treasure House of the Eye of the True Teaching|url=http://www.shastaabbey.org/shobogenzo1.htm|publisher=[[Shasta Abbey]]|accessdate=September 25, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111032704/http://www.shastaabbey.org/shobogenzo1.htm|archivedate=January 11, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A translation by a "team of translators that represent a Who’s Who of American Zen" and edited by [[Kazuaki Tanahashi]], ''Treasury of the True Dharma Eye: Zen Master Dogen's Shobo Genzo'', was released in mid-2011. Additionally, the Stanford-based Soto Zen Text Project, a project to translate Dōgen and other [[Sōtō]] texts, has completed several fascicles, freely distributed in digital format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Shōbōgenzō Treasury of the Eye of the True Dharma |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/shobogenzo/index.html|publisher=Soto Zen Text Project|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stopping thought''' is a term in [[Zen]] referring to the achievement of the mental state of [[samādhi]], where the normal mental chatter slows and then stops for brief or longer periods, allowing the practitioner to experience the peace of liberation.  This is normally first done during [[zazen]] [[meditation]], but should ideally be mastered, so that it can be done regularly.

Paradoxically, Zen teaches that the attainment of this state is not through the normal method of intent and application of skill or technique.  As stated in the Zen poem [[Hsin Hsin Ming]]:

:''"When you try to stop activity to achieve passivity your very effort fills you with activity. As long as you remain in one extreme or the other you will never know [[Henosis|oneness]]."'' - Hsin Hsin Ming

In other words, the process is a combination of acceptance and returning to or focusing on a familiar state, rather than a state achieved through pure force of will.

His academic interests cut across diverse philosophical and literary subjects, including [[ethics]], [[political philosophy]], [[philosophy of law]], [[Hermeneutics|cultural hermeneutics]], and [[Chinese philosophy|ancient Chinese philosophy]].

He is the Jesse H. Jones Professor in Liberal Arts, at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref name="Plato Rediscovered 1996 p. 327"&gt;''Plato Rediscovered: Human Value and Social Order'' (Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1996), p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2018|Source is from 1996}}

==Background==

Seung was born on September 20, 1930, the eldest of three children, near the city of [[Chongju]] in [[North Pyongan Province]].  He attended Chongju Middle School, where he was exposed to Western-style education. In 1947, he escaped from [[North Korea]], crossing the 38th parallel with a few friends. He settled in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], where he studied at [[Seoul High School]] for three years. He attended [[Yonsei University]] for only one month before the [[Korean War]] broke out in June 1950, subsequently fleeing south to [[Busan]] ahead of the advancing North Korean army.

After the end of the [[Korean War]], on the personal recommendation of President [[Syngman Rhee]], Seung enrolled at [[Yale University]] on a full scholarship under the sponsorship of the American-Korean Foundation and resumed his undergraduate studies in 1954. As resident of [[Timothy Dwight College]] and a student in the [http://directedstudies.yale.edu  Directed Studies] program, he discovered the history of Western culture. He was introduced to the latest schools of thought such as [[existentialism]], [[New Criticism]], and other intellectual movements. At Yale he was mentored by a number of famous professors, including [[Thomas G. Bergin]], [[Cleanth Brooks]], [[Brand Blanshard]], and [[F.S.C. Northrop]]. He graduated [[summa cum laude]] in 1958 with a bachelor's degree in [[philosophy]]. He entered [[Yale Law School]], but quit after one academic year, deciding instead to pursue doctoral studies in philosophy. Around this time he wrote his first book, ''The Fragile Leaves of the Sibyl: Dante's Master Plan'', which proposed a new, "trinitarian" interpretation of the [[Divine Comedy]]. His Ph.D. thesis was later published as a book, ''Kant's Transcendental Logic''.

In 1965, he received his Ph.D. and also married Kwihwan Hahn, a graduate of [[Juilliard]] in piano performance.  They have three children. His son, [[Sebastian Seung]], is Professor at the [[Princeton University]] Neuroscience Institute and Department of Computer Science.  His second son, KJ Seung, is Professor at the Harvard Medical School and the medical director at the Eugene Bell Foundation. His daughter, Florence Seung, is a psychiatrist. After teaching for a year at [[Fordham University]], Seung joined the philosophy department of the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1966, where he is the [[Jesse H. Jones]] Professor in Liberal Arts, Professor of Philosophy, Government, and Law.&lt;ref name="Plato Rediscovered 1996 p. 327"/&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2018|Source is from 1996}} In 1988, he was awarded the highest honor of Yale's graduate school alumni association—the [[Wilbur Cross Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aya.yale.edu/content/medalists-department#sechum&lt;/ref&gt;  Other winners have included [[John Silber]], [[Richard Rorty]], [[Robert Putnam]], [[Robert Dahl]], [[Bartlett Giamatti]], and [[Stanley Fish]].

==The Fragile Leaves of the Sibyl: Dante's Master Plan (1962)==

Seung's first book, ''The Fragile Leaves of the Sibyl: Dante’s Master Plan'', is a highly original reading of [[Dante]]’s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', which is crucial for understanding Seung's development as a philosopher. He articulates and illustrates his method of interpretation in his trilogy on hermeneutics, ''Cultural Thematics: The Formation of the Faustian Ethos'' (1976), ''Structuralism and Hermeneutics'' (1982), and ''Semiotics and Thematic in Hermeneutics'' (1982). These three volumes contain Seung's contribution to literary and philosophical hermeneutics and constitute the methodological groundwork for his study of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Plato]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Spinoza]], [[Goethe]], [[Wagner]], and normative political theory.

''The Fragile Leaves of the Sibyl'' grew out of a term paper Seung wrote during the first year of his graduate studies at Yale University. The subject is the most central issue in Dante Studies: the thematic unity of the ''Commedia'', which many Dante scholars still regard as either unsolved or unsolvable. For centuries, Dante readers have pondered about the relation between Dante's construction of the three realms of the afterworld (Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise) and Dante's journey through those three realms. It is not easy to say what Dante's main concern is – to describe a journey through the afterworld or to unfold a vision of the universal order?  At least, obviously, journey and order are two interdependent themes in Dante's poem. The account of the journey presupposes a cosmic order, and the order can be understood only through the account of a cosmic journey.

In ''The Fragile Leaves'', Seung says, we know that the ''Commedia'' has three parts (''Inferno'', ''Purgatorio'', and ''Paradiso''), but we do not know how these three parts constitute one poem. We learn that the three parts describe three worlds, but we do not see how the three worlds are unified into one cosmos. We find many themes and scenes in Dante's narrative, but we do not understand how those themes and scenes are woven into the central plot of Dante's text.&lt;ref&gt;''The Fragile Leaves of the Sibyl: Dante's Master Plan'' (Westminster, MD: Newman Press, 1962), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In an article, "The Metaphysics of the Commedia" published twenty five years after ''The Fragile Leaves of the Sibyl'', Seung restates his approach to ''Commedia'' as the problem of unity and division in Dante's vision: "What is the principle of unity that holds together the nine circles of Hell, the seven terraces of Purgatory, and the ten spheres of Paradise," and "What is the principle that divides Hell into nine circles, Purgatory into seven circles, and Paradise into ten spheres?"&lt;ref&gt;"The Metaphysics of the ''Commedia'' in ''the Divine Comedy and the Encyclopedia of Arts and Sciences''," ed. G.C. Scipio and A. Scaglione (Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Co., 1988), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seung elucidates the poem's thematic unity by using three principles essential to medieval Christian thinking. The first principle is the medieval classification of virtues and sins. It provides the framework for understanding the formal structures of the three realms. Seung shows that Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise are structured in accordance with the medieval table of seven natural virtues and three supernatural virtues, which are implicitly celebrated in the ten spheres of Paradiso. The natural virtues are humility, mercy, meekness, fortitude, liberality, temperance, and chastity, and the supernatural virtues are the three theological virtues of faith, hope, and love. The contraries to the natural virtues are the seven deadly sins of pride, envy, wrath, sloth, avarice, gluttony, and lust, and they are condemned as sinful acts in the various sections of Inferno, and on the seven terraces of Purgatorio they appear as vicious dispositions being purged into their virtuous opposites. Moreover, in the beginning of Inferno the supernatural virtues are thematized as being absent; in the beginning of Purgatorio they appear as distorted; near the end of Purgatorio they are celebrated as regained; and finally in the last cantos of Paradiso they are presented in full display.

Seung then shows that Dante's first principle of construction (the classification of virtues and sins) is based on his second principle, the tripartite theory of the human soul (vegetative, sensitive, and spiritual) and their powers (concupiscible, irascible, and intellectual). The natural and supernatural virtues and their contraries reflect the powers of the tripartite soul in virtuous and vicious dispositions or in virtuous and sinful acts. Dante's third and final principle of construction is the Holy Trinity. Since the human soul is created in the image of God, Seung holds, the triadic structure of the human soul resembles the trinitarian structure of divine nature, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. By establishing a systematic connection between the three parts of the human soul and the Three Persons of the Holy Trinity, Seung demonstrates that everything Dante witnesses in his epic journey is meant to be an allegorical reflection of the Holy Trinity and their activities. Because Dante scholars have failed to recognize this systematic allegorical function of Dante's epic, Seung maintains, they have reduced it to a grand Human Comedy, in which the mass of humanity Dante encounters in his journey can hardly leave any room for the presence of God. By his trinitarian reading, Seung securely installs the Holy Trinity as the epic hero of Dante poem. Apart from this interpretation, Seung says, his poem is an epic without an epic hero. Many Dante scholars have tried to cope with this poetic anomaly by exalting Dante the traveler as the epic heror. But he is only a traveling reporter, who cannot take a single step in his journey without the aid of his three guides. He never shows a heroic stature in any of his numerous actions.

Seung's trinitarian reading is best exemplified in his allegorical interpretation of Dante's three guides. Traditionally, Dante studies have focused on two guides: [[Virgil]] leads Dante through Hell and Purgatory, and Beatrice appears in the Terrestrial Paradise near the end of Purgatorio, where she replaces Virgil and becomes Dante's guide through the spheres of Paradiso. The former has commonly been interpreted as representing Reason and the latter as representing Faith. However, Seung points out that this traditional account has committed the inexcusable mistake of completely ignoring Dante's third and final guide [[Saint Bernard of Clairvaux]], who appears at the end of Dante's ascent to the highest heaven. Only through Saint Bernard's prayer to Virgin Mary is Dante granted the beatific vision of the Holy Trinity. The final guide consummates Dante's long journey, which has been initiated and sustained by his first and second guides. Therefore, the role of the former is far more important than the roles of the latter. But the most important guide could not be accommodated within the traditional Dante studies, because they have operated with the dyadic Thomistic schema of natural and supernatural orders. Virgil and Beatrice have represented these two orders and left no room for Saint Bernard. According to Seung's trinitirian reading, Dante's three guides allegorically represent the Three Persons of the Holy Trinity: Saint Bernard is Dante's ultimate and third guide. Virgil represents the Son, Beatrice represents the Holy Spirit, and Saint Bernard represents the Father.

Since the Three Persons of the Holy Trinity are the ultimate point of reference for every action of Dante's narrative and every component of his universal vision, Seung argues that the central theme of the Commedia is the Holy Trinity and its governance of the entire universe. This is his trinitarian reading of Dante's epic, which is ultimately simple and systematic. But he admits that the trinitarian meaning of the poem is not easily discovered. In order to discover it we should make a systematic parallel reading of the poem's three parts. When we focus on an episode or segment of Inferno, we should try to relate its thematic content systematically to the corresponding episode or segment of Purgatorio and Paradiso. This method of reading can be described as connectionist reading, and it stands in contrast to the prevalent method of reading in Dante studies, which commonly interpret the different episodes, segments, and parts of the poem as self-contained entities and not as thematic particulars of one cosmic theme.

Jesper Hede ([[University of Copenhagen]] in Denmark) has published an extensive defense and elaboration of Seung's Dante interpretation in comparison with Cogan's interpretation and the prevalent methods of reading in Dante studies.&lt;ref&gt;''Reading Dante: the Pursuit of Meaning'' (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural Thematics: The Formation of the Faustian Ethos (1976)==

In ''Cultural Thematics'', Seung says that his trinitarian reading of the ''Commedia'' was originally inspired by two major movements in the humanities at the time. One was the formalistic program of New Criticism with its preference for close reading under the slogan "Back to the text," and the other was European phenomenology with its motto "Let the object reveal itself instead of imposing one’s preconception upon it." Though never abandoning the phenomenological motto, Seung came to have serious doubts about the formalistic approach to textual interpretation. The outcome of these misgivings is presented in his trilogy, ''Cultural Thematics'', ''Structuralism and Hermeneutics'', and ''Semiotics and Thematics in Hermeneutics''. In the first book Seung constructively demonstrates the role of cultural context in the explication of textual meaning. In the second book he systematically examines the danger of misinterpretation inherent in the formalist and post-structuralist programs of textual interpretation, due to their disregard of contextual considerations. In the third book he takes into account the theoretical assumptions and methodological commitments that the first two books presuppose, and presents a fully elaborate theory of how to combine the phenomenological approach to textual meaning with the hermeneutic assertion that cultural contextualism is the prerequisite for adequate textual understanding and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;''Semiotics and Thematics in Hermeneutics'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1982),  p. x-xi&lt;/ref&gt;

Seung substantiates his trinitarian reading of the ''Commedia'' with a cultural contextualist examination of the intellectual development of medieval thinkers and writers during the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries. He focuses on two pairs of triads in this development: on the one hand, the intellectual differences encountered in the works of the Franciscan [[Bonaventure]], the Dominican [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the Franciscan [[Duns Scotus]], and on the other hand, the literary differences displayed in the works of the three writers that constitute the Italian [[Trecento]] literature: Dante, [[Francesco Petrarca]], and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]. Seung argues that these two triads, though not entirely corresponding in time and place, unfold some of the crucial premises for understanding the emergence of the modern secular ethos during the late Middle Ages. Seung speaks of the formation of the [[Faustian]] ethos with reference to [[Oswald Spengler]], who, in the ''[[Decline of the West]]'', speaks of the Faustian man as a medieval invention.

In demarcating the intellectual differences between the three philosophers and the three writers, Seung uses the term "sensibility." The term is carefully chosen as an alternative to the term "idea," which is often used in historicist studies of intellectual developments and changes. Sensibility refers to the way in which human beings conceive their being in the world without necessarily formulating a specific ideological system or a rigid pattern of ideas. In this regard, Seung's theory of cultural contextualism has some affinity with [[Eric Voegelin]]’s approach to historical phenomena in that the latter came to regard the term "idea" as a misconception when we try to understand how human beings experience their being in the world and act out their experiential conceptions in their every day life as well as in political and judicial forums and social institutions.

The book generated positive reviews, including one from Frank J. Warnke from the University of Georgia: "one cannot question the subtlety and intellectual rigor of his study, the quality of excitement that permeates it, and the illumination it sheds on a great and complex period of Western culture."&lt;ref&gt;''Renaissance Quarterly'', Vol. 32, No. 3 (Autumn, 1979), p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;  The noted historian of modern philosophy, A. P. Martinich, wrote, "It is a work of intelligence and imagination; it deals subtly and originally with a complex and difficult topic; and, in characterizing the modern sensibility, it also addresses the crisis of contemporary  philosophy. We who "are living in the waning days of the Faustian culture" (p. xi) experience anomie. We sense that something new is almost upon us, and we do not know what it is. Perhaps understanding what we were will help us through the change." &lt;ref&gt;"''Journal of the History of Philosophy'', Vol. 16, No. 3, p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semiotics and Thematics in Hermeneutics (1982)==

The interpretive principles of Seung’s theory of cultural thematics are most clearly stated in his article "Thematic Dialectic: A Revision of Hegelian Dialectic",&lt;ref&gt;''International Philosophical Quarterly'', Vol. 20 (1980), pp. 417-32&lt;/ref&gt; which makes up the last chapter of his book ''Semiotics and Thematics in Hermeneutics''.&lt;ref&gt;''Semiotics and Thematics in Hermeneutics'', pp. 192-217&lt;/ref&gt; Seung defines this theory as thematic dialectic, since it formally involves a revision of Hegel's [[dialectic]] as often identified with the triadic formula of thesis-antithesis-synthesis. Various scholars have argued that Hegel does not explicate this formula systematically or apply it consistently in his work. The triad is mentioned only a few times in his writings and mainly in his polemic against the logical formalism of Kant's critical idealism. For that reason, Hegelian scholars sometimes maintain that the formula is neither Hegel's invention nor the constituting pattern of his philosophy. This discussion, however, is not important for understanding the theory of thematic dialectic. The theory departs from the assertion that Hegel's system is meant to be a systematic account of how every dialectical conflict is reconciled through the synthesis of thesis and antithesis. The classical example of this pattern of thought, as stated in Hegel's ''Science of Logic'' (I.1.1), is that the concept of being and the concept of non-being are reconciled in the concept of becoming.

The theory of thematic dialectic is not an attempt to restate Hegel's theory, nor its Marxian offspring in the form of [[dialectical materialism]]. Though adapting the Hegelian logic of "both-and" in combination with the [[Kierkegaard]]ian logic of "either-or" as well as the Buddhist logic of "neither-nor," the theory breaks open the narrow perimeter that has been set by [[Hegel]], [[Marx]], and [[Kierkegaard]] in that it transforms the rigidity of the Hegelian system into flexibility, its uniformity into diversity, and its [[logical truth|logical necessity]] into existential contingency.&lt;ref&gt;"Thematic Dialectic: A Revision of Hegelian Dialectic," p. 432&lt;/ref&gt; The theory adapts Hegel's notion of historical dialectic in that it departs from Hegel's inexhaustible idea that every cultural theme has its dialectical opposite:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"For example, the cultural theme of regarding nature as an object of contempt and defilement is dialectically opposed to that of adoring it as an object of beauty and sanctity. These two cultural themes are incompatible with each other, because they are contraries. That is, if one of them is to be realized, the other must be rejected. The opposition of these two cultural themes may be called thematic exclusion or contrariety. Theirs is the dialectic of incompatible or incommensurate themes."&lt;ref&gt;''Semiotics and Thematics in Hermeneutics'', p. 203-204&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This type of opposition resembles the Kantian notion of [[antinomy]]. However, we are not dealing with pure concepts but with propositions. One proposition can say that nature is adorable, and another proposition can say that nature is contemptuous. Thematic exclusion is the classical form of "either-or."

The theory of thematic dialectic is resourceful in outlining the ways in which the problem of opposition can be resolved. In this respect, it deviates from Hegel's historicism in that it gives a systematic account of the interplay of cultural themes that does not rely on a rigid conception of synthesis. Cultural themes are cultural ideals. For example, the atheist ideal of rejecting the existence of God is a cultural theme, and the theist ideal of believing in the existence of God is another cultural theme. These two ideals exclude each other. But in some cases, their mutual exclusion is not fully sustained. Seung argues that thematic exclusion should be distinguished from thematic tension or competition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"For example, the cultural theme of being concerned with the other world is not necessarily incompatible with the cultural theme of being concerned with this world, because one does not logically exclude the other. That is, it is possible for someone to be concerned with both worlds. But these two cultural themes can be in competition with each other, and their competition can create tension. Nevertheless, theirs is the dialectic of compatible or commensurate themes."&lt;ref name="Hermeneutics p. 204"&gt;''Semiotics and Thematics in Hermeneutics'', p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The dialectic of cultural themes is their tension, conflict, and interaction. But thematic tension can be resolved in different ways. The Hegelian way of synthesis or "both-and" is one way to resolve it. The Kierkegaardian way of exclusion or "either-or" is another way—that is, given the two cultural ideals it resolves their conflict by rejecting one of them. A third way is to reject both ideals, which has been the Buddhist approach. This is the way of "neither-nor" in contrast to the way of "either-or", which, in turn, is contrasted to the way of "both-and." However, these three ways do not cover all types of resolution.

According to the theory of thematic dialectic, the forms of thematic tension fall in two principal groups, each of which is divided into three main positions. On the one hand, we have the group of dualistic resolutions, and on the other hand, we have the group of monistic resolutions. The former are dualistic in that they accept the existence of two competing themes, and the latter are monistic in that they do not accept the existence of two competing themes. The dualistic group consists of (1) resolution by equilibrium, (2) resolution by suppression, and (3) resolution by subordination. The monistic group consists of (4) resolution by fusion, (5) resolution by elimination, and (6) resolution by absorption. If we add to these six forms of resolution the form of exclusion, the theory of thematic dialectic denotes, in all, seven ways in which the interplay of dialectical opposites can take place. The systematic quality of the theory is manifest, for example, in the fact that the resolution by equilibrium is the dualistic counterpart to the monistic resolution by fusion, the resolution by suppression is the dualistic counterpart to the monistic resolution by elimination, and the resolution by subordination is the dualistic counterpart to the monistic resolution by absorption.

The resolution by equilibrium is to keep two conflicting themes in balance. It can be used for achieving a balance between two competing interests, for example, "the conflict between the private interests of individuals and the public interests of their community can be resolved in this manner. Both interests can be regarded as equally important, and their conflict can be resolved by maintaining a proper balance between them."&lt;ref name="Hermeneutics p. 204"/&gt; Resolution by suppression denotes that one theme suppresses another, and resolution by subordination denotes that one theme is subordinated to another. In explaining their difference, Seung takes the medieval ideal of ''[[contemptus mundi]]'' as the example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Concern for this world was to be totally suppressed for the sake of concern for the other world. By the twelfth century, this resolution was being replaced by another: secular concern was not to be suppressed but only to be subordinated to religious concern. This is resolution by subordination. Resolution by suppression was acceptable, as long as the medieval Christians took no strong interest in the natural order. Once they started taking a positive attitude toward nature, this resolution became difficult to maintain and had to be superseded by the resolution by subordination."&lt;ref&gt;''Semiotics and Thematics in Hermeneutics'', pp. 204-205&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Resolutions by equilibrium, suppression, and subordination are well known phenomena in our time. But it is most often the resolutions by suppression and subordination that make the headlines because they involve an uneven relationship between two ideals that often disturbs the culturally contingent sense of democracy and equality in Western societies. However, although these dualistic forms of resolution are prominent, they do not cover the whole spectrum of thematic dialectic.

The resolution by fusion means to fuse two conflicting themes into one. For example, the idea of a supernatural order can be fused with the idea of a natural order by making the former immanent in the latter, as it was advocated in the Romantic idea of natural supernaturalism or supernatural naturalism. Resolution by elimination denotes that one theme eliminates another. Extreme scientism is an example of this type of resolution. By looking upon physical things from a strictly positivistic and materialist point of view, the scientistic position eradicates every spiritual experience and reduces all things to physical matter. Scientific materialism is reductive; it reduces mind to matter. The opposite reduction is also possible; it is to reduce matter to mind. This is also a resolution by elimination. Unlike these reductive methods, the resolution by fusion rejects reduction. But all of them produce a monistic result. The last type of resolution is the resolution by absorption, which denotes that one theme absorbs another. This type of resolution is perhaps the most difficult to comprehend because it can easily get mistaken for the resolution by fusion. In Seung's words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Although both modes produce monistic results, they differ in one important respect. In resolution by fusion, the two competing cultural themes operate as equals; both lose their original identities in the process of fusion and gain a joint identity. In resolution by absorption, the two competing themes operate as unequals; only one can retain its original identity and integrity, while the other must lose them."&lt;ref name="Hermeneutics p. 208"&gt;''Semiotics and Thematics in Hermeneutics'', p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Seung explains the resolution by absorption as it was used for resolving the conflict between individual and communal interests. This conflict can be resolved in different ways. For example, it can be resolved by the resolution by equilibrium. But Seung points out that this resolution became impossible with the emergence of the sovereign individual in the late [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"because the sovereign will of the individual could not be retained and preserved in such an equilibrium. It dictated the subordination of communal interests to the individual will, but even this resolution was not quite perfect from the standpoint of individual sovereignty, because it could not fully eliminate the thematic tension between the individual and the communal interests."&lt;ref&gt;''Semiotics and Thematics in Hermeneutics'', p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This tension, however, was resolved by making the one absorb the other. The political idea that people can form a commonwealth if they subject their wills to the will of one individual is an example of individual absorption of communal interests. This is the idea of absolute monarchy and [[enlightened absolutism]], which governed European politics from the 17th to 19th century. The political idea that the interests of the individuals cannot be distinguished from the interests of the state is an example of communal absorption of individual interests. This idea was pervasive in the communist states of the 20th century. Moreover, Seung points out that these two types of absorption can be joined. [[Nazism]] is a case in point: "the individual interests of all citizens were absorbed into the interests of the state or the race, which in turn were absorbed into the interests of the Führer."&lt;ref name="Hermeneutics p. 208"/&gt; The cults of [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Mao Zedong]] are other examples, although they might differ in formal terms from that of [[Adolf Hitler]] in that the General Secretary did not have officially the same status as that of the Nazi leader.

Besides being a systematic account of the various types of resolution, the theory of thematic dialectic is also a systematic theory of how to deal with the problem of consequence in considering the interplay of dialectical opposites. Seung argues that "the resolution of a thematic conflict establishes the dominance of some cultural theme or themes, which can produce certain thematic consequences. These consequences can also take various forms."&lt;ref&gt;''Semiotics and Thematics in Hermeneutics'', p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; He outlines six forms of thematic consequence: (1) continuance: a cultural theme maintains its dominance over another cultural theme; (2) expansion: a cultural theme expands its dominance over another cultural theme; (3) reaction: a cultural theme reacts against the dominance of another cultural theme; (4) reversal: the dominance of a cultural theme over another is reversed; (5) repression: one cultural theme represses another cultural theme; and (6) deterioration: a cultural theme deteriorates and is replaced by another cultural theme.

These cultural events can take place in various historical contexts. There is no simple schema for causally linking one of these events to another. Seung stresses the variety of possibilities in his discussion of thematic conflicts, their resolutions, and their consequences. In short, his account of thematic dialectic is highly existential and contingent, whereas Hegel's account was logical and necessatarian. Though critical of Hegel's logical necessitarianism that every dialectical conflict can be resolved only by way of synthesis, Seung does not reject the assertion that thematic resolutions may be determined by historical causes and conditions operating on the thematic conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;''Semiotics and Thematics in Hermeneutics'', p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the historical determinism that governs Hegel's historical dialectic is integrated as one option among several others in the theory of thematic dialectic.

==Plato Rediscovered: Human Value and Social Order (1996)==

Seung's [[Plato]] book is distinctive for several reasons – most notably, it is his only substantial work on an ancient or pre-Christian philosopher.  But it is not difficult to discern how it fits into his greater corpus. Indeed, ''Plato Rediscovered'' marks a high point in the development of Seung's methodological and substantive interests.  Methodologically, he employs his cultural thematics to construct a comprehensive reading of a philosopher central to the entire Western tradition.  That is, he seeks out the most pressing questions of Plato's time and tries to understand how Plato responded to them.  Substantively, the book addresses the question of eternal or transcendent norms (or "Platonism") versus what he calls "positive norms".

Seung's study of [[Plato]] is the third volume of his trilogy on normative philosophy, which began in 1993 with his ''Intuition and Construction'' (Yale University Press).  Seung's concern there was to identify the normative foundations for [[John Rawls]]’s theory of justice.  He found two Rawlses – roughly correlating to the early and later works.  The early Rawls of ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' presented his normative philosophy as transcendentally true of all cultures. But the later Rawls of the Dewey Lectures and ''[[Political Liberalism]]'' backed off from this lofty perspective and took the modest position that his theory of justice was based on the values embedded in his own culture (viz., liberty and equality). The problem with the latter approach on which Rawls eventually settles is that it is wide open to charges of moral or cultural relativism – charges that continued to trouble Rawls throughout his career.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} In his personal reply to Seung's critique on this point, Rawls confided his frustration in finding a satisfactory foundation for his theory of justice.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

For his earlier transcendental perspective, Rawls claims to have drawn his inspiration from [[Immanuel Kant]], but openly disdains his formalistic ethics for its vacuity. In his own Kantian interpretation of justice as fairness, Rawls notes that Kant's formalistic ethics advocates no more than the generality and universality of moral principles, the formal requirement for any moral theory. In his view, no substantive theory of justice can be constructed on such a slender basis. He goes on to say, "The real force of his [Kant's] view lies elsewhere." But he does not specify the indefinite expression "elsewhere". This became an enigma in Rawls scholarship. Seung tries to solve this enigma by investigating Kant's entire works in normative philosophy. His efforts have appeared in two books, ''Kant’s Platonic Revolution in Moral and Political Philosophy'' (Johns Hopkins, 1994), and ''Kant: A Guide for the Perplexed'' (Continuum, 2007).

According to Seung's investigation, it has been the most grievous long-standing mistake in the study of Kant's ethics to assume that he has espoused no other moral theory than his formalistic ethics and that the ''Groundwork'' is his most important work in ethics. Prior to the ''Groundwork'', according to Seung, Kant had embraced Platonic Ideas as the foundation of his ethics in his Inaugural Dissertation of 1770 and reaffirmed his Platonic allegiance in the ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (1781).&lt;ref&gt;''Kant's Platonic Revolution'', pp. 30-32, 61-68&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''Groundwork'', Kant had to abandon his Platonic ethics because he designed his ethical formalism as a Copernican revolution in ethics.&lt;ref&gt;''Kant's Platonic Revolution'', pp. 96-101&lt;/ref&gt;  In distinction from this new position, Seung labels Kant's Platonic ethics his ethical Platonism. This version of his ethics had never been recognized until it was uncovered by Seung.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} He has further shown that Kant did not sustain his ethical formalism very long after the ''Groundwork''. In ''Critique of Practical Reason'', Kant may appear to retain his formalistic framework, but he injects Platonic content into this framework.&lt;ref&gt;''Kant'', pp. 123-126&lt;/ref&gt;  That was only three years later than the ''Groundwork''.

In ''Metaphysics of Morals'', which is supposed to be his crowning work in ethics, Kant does not even retain this formalistic framework and reverts to the traditional substantive ethics.&lt;ref&gt;''Kant'', pp. 137-143&lt;/ref&gt;  He divides this work into two Parts: (1) the theory of justice and (2) the theory of virtue. Neither of these two topics was even mentioned in the ''Groundwork''. This is the checkered career of Kant's ethical theory from the Inaugural Dissertation through the first two ''Critiques'' and the ''Groundwork'' to the ''Metaphysics of Morals''. Seung does not only trace this checkered career, but also clearly exposes the vacuity of Kant's ethical formalism, thereby vindicating Ralws's dismissal of it. Seung concludes his study of Kant's ethical works by declaring that Rawls's theory of justice was inspired not by ''Groundwork'', but by the theory of justice in the ''Metaphysics of Morals''. He further explains that this theory in turn had been inspired by the Platonic Idea of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;''Kant'', pp. 142-143&lt;/ref&gt;  So he calls it Kant's Platonic Revolution.

These works on Rawls and Kant eventually led Seung to Plato, the first political philosopher of the West. He opens the preface of his Plato book by saying, "Political philosophy is one of the great inventions by Plato's genius." But this invention took a long intellectual journey, and Seung reconstructs the itinerary of this journey by thematically connecting twenty-two of Plato's dialogues. The point of departure for this journey was the ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'', and the ''Republic'' and the ''Laws'' turned out to be its two destinations. Through the mouth of [[Callicles]], the ''Gorgias'' presents the challenge of power politics, as it was practiced in Athenian imperialism and as it was depicted in [[Thucydides]]’s account of the [[Peloponnesian War]].&lt;ref&gt;''Plato Rediscovered'', pp. 30-32&lt;/ref&gt;  In the domain of power politics, power is the ultimate foundation of all normative principles because it alone dictates and sustains all positive norms and refuses to recognize any other normative standards. Callicles maintains that only power should rule because that is the law of nature and that all constraints on power are the chains cunningly devised by the weak to control the strong. Seung claims that in this dialogue, Plato's Socrates tries to prove that Callicles's theory of power politics is wrong, but fails to deliver a substantial argument. Hence the dialogue ends without a decisive resolution. From then on, Seung holds, Plato took upon himself the task of finding an effective response to Callecles's political philosophy of power.&lt;ref&gt;''Plato Rediscovered'', pp. xv-xviii&lt;/ref&gt;  This task became his lifelong mission and his philosophical journey.

It is Seung's thesis that Plato set out to overcome Callicles's challenge by formulating his own political philosophy on the basis of eternal normative standards. Without appealing to such eternal norms, it was impossible to talk about the justice or injustice of any positive norms because every positive norm is just by its own standard.&lt;ref&gt;''Plato Rediscovered'', pp. 293-308&lt;/ref&gt;  But it is not easy to recognize such eternal norms, nor is it any easier to use them in constructing a political institution. Hence Plato had to write a long series of dialogues, which paved his way to the ''[[Republic]]'', where he constructed his ideal state, the Kallipolis. This was the first half of his long journey. But he soon recognized two fatal defects in the ''Republic''.&lt;ref&gt;''Plato Rediscovered'', pp. 145, 252&lt;/ref&gt;  First, the standard for being a philosopher-ruler for this ideal state was too high because the ruler was supposed to be absolutely intelligent and totally incorruptible. It was a superhuman standard well beyond all mortals. In formulating this superhuman ideal, Plato had completely ignored the empirical human nature.&lt;ref&gt;''Plato Rediscovered'', p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;  He had made the same mistake in advocating that the members of the governing class should be allowed to have neither their own families and children, nor their own properties. This was to free them from the chain of private interests in order to make them perfect public servants. Plato came to realize that such a drastic measure went against the most basic human nature.

The second fatal defect of the ''Republic'' was Plato's conception of knowledge and intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;''Plato Rediscovered'', pp. 286-288&lt;/ref&gt;  This was an important topic because the Kallipolis was to be governed by the philosopher-ruler's intelligence and knowledge. The ''Republic'' had emphatically demarcated knowledge (or wisdom) from opinion (or conjecture). Although this demarcation sounds commonplace, it is based on Plato's metaphysical demarcation between the eternal realm of Forms and the temporal realm of phenomena. Knowledge is infallible; opinion is fallible. The scope of knowledge is restricted to the domain of eternal Forms or Platonic Ideas because only they are truly intelligible. One can become a philosopher by gaining the knowledge of eternal Forms. But the temporal phenomena can never be the objects of knowledge because they are ever mutable and unintelligible.&lt;ref&gt;''Plato Rediscovered'', p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;  They can be only the objects of opinion or fallible conjecture even for philosophers. But the knowledge of Forms is insufficient for governing the Kallipolis. Because it is situated in the phenomenal world, its proper government requires the knowledge of phenomena. Since the philosopher-rulers have no knowledge of phenomena, they have to govern by their opinion. This surely undermines Plato's ideal of government by knowledge and wisdom.

The importance of understanding phenomena is indirectly acknowledged at least once in the ''Republic''. When Socrates begins to recount the degeneration of the Kallipolis at the beginning of Book 8, he says that its deterioration is most likely to be caused by its leaders' mistakes in handling the eugenics of future rulers by sense perception and calculation. Without the knowledge of phenomena, it would indeed be impossible to avoid mistakes in breeding because eugenics takes place in the phenomenal world. The understanding of phenomena is even more critical for the construction of the Kallipolis because it is based on the tripartite theory of the soul. The three classes of the Kallipolis are modeled after the three parts of the soul. Since there is no Form of the soul, the tripartite theory can never be knowledge, but only an opinion. Thus Plato's ideal state is built on opinion rather than on knowledge. This is the second fatal defect of the ''Republic''. The Kallipolis turned out to be a product of opinion although it was presented as a product of philosophical wisdom.

Plato had to mend these two fatal defects of the Kallipolis and reconstruct his political philosophy. Thus began the second half of Plato's long journey, according to Seung, and it was finally concluded in the ''[[Laws]]'', where he constructed a constitution for the city of Magnesia.&lt;ref&gt;''Plato Rediscovered'', pp. 229-235&lt;/ref&gt;  In this reconstruction, Plato eliminates the first fatal defect—the superhuman ruler—by replacing the rule of man by the rule of law. Magnesia is a legal state, whose function does not totally depend on the perfect wisdom and virtue of rulers. All citizens of Magnesia participate in the governance of their state through an intricate system of councils on many different levels. Unlike the Kallipolis, Magnasia does not demand the total dedication of citizens and their rulers to the well-being of the state. They are allowed to have their own families and even private properties although the state sets the upper and lower limits to private possessions. This is Plato's acceptance of human nature in the phenomenal world.

The 'Statesman' presents the myth of two ages: the age of Kronos and the age of Zeus. In the first age, the world rolls forward; in the second age, the world reverses its motion and rolls backward. In the age of Kronos, the divine rulers govern the world by their wisdom. In the age of Zeus, the human rulers  govern their social order by laws. This myth has been interpreted as Plato's philosophy of history or his metaphysical cosmology. But Seung interprets it as Plato's explanation for his shift from the government by virtues in the ''Republic'' to the government by laws in the ''Laws''. By the myth of two ages, Seung says, Plato expresses his realization that the Kallipois is unfit for our age because we are living in the age of Zeus rather than in the age of Kronos.&lt;ref&gt;''Plato Rediscovered'', pp. 255-258&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato cannot eliminate the second fatal defect of the Kallipolis by institutional reforms. He tries to overcome it by devising a scientific way of understanding phenomena. He begins this project in ''Theaetetus'' by introducing two elements of perceptual knowledge: (1) knowing the sameness and (2) knowing the difference. Plato now believes that these two methods of perception can deliver the knowledge of phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;''Plato Rediscovered'', PP. 152-154&lt;/ref&gt;  He substantiates this possibility by defining the sophist in ''Sophist'' and the statesman in ''Statesman''. Since the objects of these definitions belong to the domain of phenomena, Seung points out, they are entirely different from the definitions of Forms.&lt;ref&gt;''Plato Rediscovered'', pp. 172-181&lt;/ref&gt;  They are the descriptions of phenomena that can deliver knowledge if they are rigorous enough. To be sure, they cannot be as rigorous as the definition of mathematical Forms. The difference of these two types of definition is like the difference between the square root of a square number such as 4 or 9 and that of an oblong number such as 2 or 3. The former is a rational number; the latter is an irrational number. Unlike the former, the computation of the latter can never be completed. Although it is only an approximation of its true value, it is qualitatively different from a mere guess or opinion. Since its method of approximation is scientific, it should be regarded as knowledge rather than as opinion. Likewise, our definition (or description) of phenomena such as sophists and statesman can never be completed, but it can ever approximate the ultimate nature of phenomena closer and closer. This is Plato's revised view of how we can gain the knowledge of phenomena, according to Seung's interpretation of his later dialogues.&lt;ref&gt;''Plato Rediscovered'', pp. 179-180&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato's revised view of knowledge goes together with his revised view of Forms.&lt;ref&gt;''Plato Rediscovered'', pp. 185-216&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a long series of discussions on the question whether or not Plato retained his theory of Forms in his late dialogues. But Seung is the only scholar to advocate the thesis that Plato revised his theory of Forms. He explains this revision by distinguishing between simple and complex Forms. Complex Forms are definable; simple Forms are indefinable. Although Plato was obsessed with definition for a long time, Seung holds, he eventually realized that only complex Forms can be defined and that simple Forms are required for their definitions. Simple Forms can also be called primitive or ultimate Forms (or arche in Greek). They cannot be known by definition; they can be known only by direct intuition.&lt;ref&gt;''Plato Rediscovered'', pp. 218-219&lt;/ref&gt;  The indefinable primitive Forms are already encountered in the ''Republic'', for example, the Form of the Good. Socrates admits its indefinability and explains its nature by the analogy of the sun. In the second part of ''Parmenides'', Seung says, Plato examines eight possible systems of primitive Forms as eight hypotheses. In ''Sophist'', he joins Hypotheses 5 and 7 into his final system of ultimate Forms. He counts Being, Identity, Difference, Motion, and Rest as the most important ones. In his late dialogues, Seung holds, Plato retains only the simple Forms. This is his revised theory of Forms. In his original theory of Forms, he had never clearly recognized the distinction between simple and complex Forms. Hence Platonic Heaven contained all Forms, simple or complex.

Seung has labeled Plato's old theory of Forms as the Skyscraper version and his new theory as the Bedrock version.&lt;ref&gt;''Plato Rediscovered'', pp. 241-242&lt;/ref&gt;  The eidetic population of Platonic Heaven has changed from the fully loaded Skyscraper version to the sparsely loaded Bedrock version. In the Skyscraper version, Forms are conceived as fully determinate, and they are the objects of definition. In the Bedrock version, they are conceived as highly indeterminate, and they are the basic elements for the construction of complex Forms. For this reason, Seung says, Plato changed his conception of definition. In the Skyscraper version, definition was the art of describing the nature of eternal Forms. In the Bedrock version, definition became the art of constructing complex Forms by using primitive Forms, as demonstrated in the definitions of sophist and statesman. Seung regards the construction of the Kallipolis as the watershed of this change because it can be seen as the construction of a new Form or as the description of an eternal Form. Although it is obviously a product of construction by Socrates and his interlocutors, he says that it is a model laid in heaven for anyone to see (''Rep'', 592b). If so, he was only describing it. So the Kallipolis can be viewed in two ways.&lt;ref&gt;''Plato Rediscovered'', p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

The art of construction is the most continuous theme in Plato's late dialogues, according to Seung. In ''Sophist'', it is called the art of weaving Forms into a proposition. In ''Philebus'', it is called a gift of the gods to human beings or the divine method.&lt;ref&gt;''Plato Rediscovered'', pp. 223-226&lt;/ref&gt;  Socrates illustrates it by the art of dividing vocal sounds into vowels and consonants for the construction of language and by the art of dividing musical sounds and organizing them into a system of intervals and harmonic scales. Seung calls this divine art the art of Pythagorean construction because it is based on Pythagoreanism.&lt;ref&gt;''Plato Rediscovered'', p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;  By using this art, Plato constructs Magnesia as a rational state in the ''Laws'' and then the entire universe as a rational cosmos in ''Timaeus''. By locating a rational state in a rational cosmos, Seung holds, Plato finally perfected his response to Callicles.&lt;ref&gt;''Plato Rediscovered'', pp. 236-240&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Gorgias'', Callicles had maintained that only power had the right to rule because it was the law of nature and that any other kind of social order was a futile struggle against the power of natural order. Plato now can say that the natural order is not beastly but rational and that a rational state is a natural extension of the cosmic order.&lt;ref&gt;''Plato Rediscovered'', pp. 264-275&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus he has concluded his lifelong mission and his epic journey.

This is Seung's outline of Plato's epic journey. For this outline, Seung has devised a new way of reading Plato's dialogues. The traditional method is to read each of them as a self-contained work, but Seung's unique way is to find their thematic interconnections and read them as a continuing series. He says that his connectionist approach was inspired by Plato's peculiar way of naming his dialogues. Except for the ''Republic'' and the ''Laws'', none of them bear the titles that indicate their subject matters. ''Sophist'' and ''Statesman'' may appear exceptions. But the real topics of these two dialogues are not the sophist and the statesman, but the problems in the art of defining them. Why are only the ''Republic'' and the ''Laws'' named after their topics? Moreover, only these two works are extended dialogues. The former is divided into ten Books and the latter into twelve Books. None of the other dialogues are long enough to require such a division. On the basis of these bibliographical data, Seung has formed the hypothesis that the two long dialogues were the two destinations for Plato's epic journey and that all other dialogues were his stepping stones leading up to those end points. Every dialogue Plato writes usually generates new problems, and he writes another dialogue to take up those new problems. So Seung says that the dialogues themselves generate their own thematic interconnections.&lt;ref&gt;''Plato Rediscovered'', pp. xvi-xvii&lt;/ref&gt;  By articulating these interconnections, Seung has revealed the complex itinerary of Plato's philosophical journey.

Seung's book has been received well in reviews, notably being identified by Thomas J. Lewis of McMaster University as a "scholarly tour de force".&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Journal of Political Science'', Vol. 29, No. 4 (Dec. 1996), p. 823.&lt;/ref&gt;  The renowned scholar of Plato's political theory{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}, George Klosko (University of Virginia), called Seung's interpretation a "dazzling synthesis", marked by its "glittering intellectuality."&lt;ref&gt;''American Political Science Review'', Vol. 91, No. 2 (June 1997), p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seung's interpretation of Plato has proved influential in the work of [[Jack Balkin|J.M. Balkin]]&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, his "Transcendental Deconstruction, Transcendent Justice," in the ''Michigan Law Review'', Vol. 92 (1994): 1131-86 and ''Cultural Software: A Theory of Ideology'', (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998), especially chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://las.depaul.edu/departments/political-science/faculty/Pages/david-lay-williams.aspx David Lay Williams],&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, his ''Rousseau's Platonic Enlightenment'' (University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; who have made much of the Bedrock theory of the Forms in modern and contemporary political philosophy.

==Nietzsche's Epic of the Soul (2005)==

In ''Nietzsche’s Epic of the Soul: Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', Seung develops an innovative reading of [[Nietzsche]]’s most abstruse work, ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''. Seung’s primary contention is that Nietzsche’s readers have not paid sufficient attention to the narrative unity of ''Zarathustra''. Indeed, many readers have treated the work as nothing more than a collection of disjointed aphorisms, speeches, and parables. The most generous interpretations prior to Seung’s have allowed that the first three Parts of Zarathustra do, in fact, constitute a coherent narrative. However, Seung finds troubling the tendency of these interpretations to view the fourth and final Part of Zarathustra either as an embarrassing addition to the first three Parts or as a low comedy following a tragedy, after the manner of ancient Greek theater. Seung maintains that Part IV, rather than constituting a burlesque that is irrelevant to what precedes it, actually depicts the fulfillment of Zarathustra’s previously unrealized ambitions. Hence, Part IV represents the epic conclusion to a spiritual journey, the trajectory of which spans from Part I to Part IV of ''Zarathustra''.

Seung accomplishes his reading of ''Zarathustra'' by decoding the distinctive meaning and role of each Part of the narrative. In Part I of ''Zarathustra'', Seung argues, the protagonist sets out an agenda to spiritualize the secular world. Seung is careful to point out that Nietzsche’s opposition to [[Christianity]] should not be mistaken for antagonism to all things spiritual. Zarathustra harangues the [[bourgeois]] ethos of [[secular humanism]], embodied by the townspeople in the marketplace in "Zarathustra’s Prologue," for neglecting the soul. The secular humanists are too readily satiated by material prosperity and other petty forms of comfort. In an effort to save humanity from the pitfalls of secular humanism in the wake of [[God is dead|God's death]], Zarathustra erects an ideal which Seung dubs the "Faustian superman." The [[Faustian]] ideal, so Zarathustra hopes, will serve as a viable replacement for the old Judeo-Christian God. Whereas God formerly functioned as the guarantor of the world's value, now it is up to the Faustian superman to endow the world with meaning through the power of his creative will. Seung refers to this Faustian ideal as the ideal of the "sovereign individual."

Zarathustra's notion of a sovereign, or autonomous, individual is linked inextricably to the traditional Western notion of an ego, or agent, situated outside the chain of natural causes and effects. The agent is a sort of unmoved mover, capable of willing events into existence without itself being the effect of causes beyond its control. Passages in Part I accordingly show Zarathustra exulting in the power of the creative individual who successfully inscribes the edicts of his sovereign will in the raw material of the cosmos. Many of Nietzsche's commentators have seen no more in Zarathustra, or in Nietzsche for that matter, than the elevation of the Faustian ideal.&lt;ref&gt;For a strong Faustian reading of Nietzsche, see [[Alexander Nehamas]], ''Nietzsche: Life as Literature'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;  Seung, however, does not see the ideal propounded by Zarathustra in Part I as the considered view either of Zarathustra or of Nietzsche. In fact, Part II sets the Faustian ideal in conflict with another ideal, that of the Spinozan hero.

The Spinozan hero, unlike the Faustian hero, accepts that he belongs to the inexorable knot of cosmic causes and effects. He acknowledges his lack of agent causal (i.e. metaphysical) power and affirms his physical/animal being. Seung refers to the Spinozan self as the cosmic self, that is, as the self that is coextensive with cosmic necessity. Whereas the Faustian hero wishes to be positioned outside of Nature and necessity and to assert his will against them, the Spinozan hero knows he lacks the power to combat necessity. Although Nietzsche expresses his admiration for [[Spinoza]] on multiple occasions, Nietzsche scholars have been remiss to draw any link between the two thinkers. But as Seung perspicaciously notes, "The problem of being trapped in the inexorable web of causal chains…was Spinoza’s central problem."

The connection between Spinoza and Nietzsche, then, is that both are concerned with preserving spiritual meaning in a deterministic cosmos. Zarathustra, however, in Part II is unable to stomach his being no more than the sum effect of causes beyond his autonomous control. Lacking free will means he cannot realize the Faustian ideal, because he lacks the autonomous will which was to stamp itself upon the yielding cosmos. Rather than molding the cosmos, he must be helplessly molded by it. Consequently, the spiritual agenda laid out in Part I is doomed to fail, much to Zarathustra's chagrin. Thus, Part II of ''Zarathustra'' chronicles the suffering of the human will that aspires to autonomy under the onus of cosmic necessity. Indeed, the central struggle of the book is the antagonism between the Faustian conception of the self and the Spinozan conception of the self. Nietzsche has, in essence, turned the problem of free will and determinism into the existential struggle of his hero, Zarathustra.

Part III stages the battle between Zarathustra's Faustian ideal and the Spinozan ideal, represented by a dwarf. Most readers of ''Zarathustra'' posit the dwarf of Part III as a force which Zarathustra must overcome if he is to affirm eternal recurrence. Seung, on the other hand, forcefully argues that the dwarf, not Zarathustra, is the custodian of the thought of eternal recurrence in Part III. Zarathustra reacts violently against the dwarf's rendition of eternal recurrence, because it seemingly reduces humans to nothing but puppets whose every action has already been decided by the cycles of eternal recurrence. The dwarf's version of eternal recurrence, Seung contends, functions as a poetic metaphor for determinism. If time is a circle, as the dwarf proclaims, and each life has already been lived innumerable times before, then nothing new can happen this time around.

Concerning every action I will perform, I lack the freedom to bring about a result different from what has happened in previous cycles and what must happen again. But this lack of human freedom and the consequent absence of alternate possibilities is precisely what is entailed by a deterministic view of the cosmos, given Nietzsche's metaphysical commitments. So Zarathustra must affirm the dwarf's doctrine of [[eternal recurrence]] if he is to come to terms with what it means to live in a deterministic universe. And to accept living in a deterministic universe is just to accept being a fully natural being—that is, a being that lacks the metaphysical power of free will. Coming to terms with eternal recurrence thus will force Zarathustra to give up his pretense to being a Faustian superman. Instead, he will be forced to acknowledge his belonging to cosmic necessity. However, by the end of Part III, Zarathustra still has not acknowledged his cosmic self. When Nietzsche expresses his longing for Eternity (the cosmic knot of necessity) at the end of Part III in "The Seven Seals," Seung observes that Eternity is nowhere to be found. Hence, Zarathustra's purported love for Eternity cannot be consummated in Part III.

Seung's groundbreaking reading, as already mentioned, centers on Part IV of ''Zarathustra''. He contests that in "The Drunken Song" Zarathustra finally embraces his Spinozan self. Ceasing to aspire to autonomy, Zarathustra instead envisions himself as coextensive with cosmic necessity. As Seung puts it, Zarathustra becomes infused with the power of Mother Nature, which is interchangeable with cosmic necessity. Seung's conclusion is borne out by the highly comical section of Part IV entitled "The Ass Festival." Seung argues that the ass represents [[Dionysus]] and that Zarathustra and his followers are actually involved in a sort of [[Dionysian]] nature worship. Zarathustra has finally learned to love the deterministic forces of Mother Nature and to love his animal self—or, his self as nothing more than part of the cosmic chain of causes and effects. The zenith of Zarathustra's spiritual journey is, in the final analysis, religious. He has conceded that the autonomous will is illusory and has accepted that his life, like all lives, is directed by Mother Nature. His power thus consists not in his ability to assert his autonomous will against the cosmos, but rather in his giving himself over to Mother Nature. This relinquishing of autonomous will and subsequent acquiescence to necessity seems, so Seung argues, to culminate in a highly religious experience of Mother Nature for Zarathustra.

It might seem ironic that Nietzsche's answer to the death of God is itself religious. Seung confesses that this is the last thing he expected to discover when he embarked on his work. But Nietzsche's Dionysian religion, unlike the Judeo-Christian religious tradition which preceded it, is a naturalized form of religion. It repudiates the metaphysical view of human agency that girds the Judeo-Christian tradition, substituting a naturalized vision of the self and of what it means to be human. Seung, however, issues a final warning against taking Zarathustra's Dionysian transformation for the end of Zarathustra's travails. At the end of ''Zarathustra'', it appears that the hero's Faustian self might make a resurgence. Seung explains this by contending that part of what it means to be human, at least at this stage in human history according to Nietzsche, is to be torn between what our Western tradition teaches us about ourselves and what science teaches us about ourselves.

Tradition would have us believe in the existence of our autonomous wills, and subsequently in our power to become Faustian ideals. Science would have us believe that we are no different from Mother Nature's other children, which are subject to the deterministic mechanisms governing the cosmos. Nietzsche may not think us capable of resolving this conflict, and Seung is reluctant to draw any hard conclusions about Nietzsche's final views. But Seung's work does open up interesting questions about Nietzsche's commitment to naturalism; and perhaps most importantly to Nietzsche scholars, his reading of eternal recurrence is highly provocative. While Seung's contention that eternal recurrence is a metaphor for determinism is not original, his argument that Nietzsche galvanizes eternal recurrence to make us rethink what it means to be human in a deterministic world is highly original. Nietzsche's readers might profit from reconsidering the trend in Nietzsche studies to see Nietzsche as the herald of a purely Faustian ideal. The Spinozan themes in Nietzsche's work might deserve more attention.

Although only relatively recently published, it has attracted much positive attention.  Robert Gooding Williams (University of Chicago, Political Science) wrote in a review for ''Ethics'' that Seung's book constitutes a "major addition to the philosophical study of ''Also Sprach Zarathustra''".&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics'', Vol. 117, No. 1 (October, 2006), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert Weldon Whalen (Queens University of Charlotte) wrote that "Neither ''Zarathustra'' nor Seung's ''Nietzsche's Epic of the Soul'' are for the timid, but the rewards each offers justifies the work demanded.  Seung's argument may not convince everyone, but no one could deny his argument's power, creativity, and wisdom.  ''Nietzsche's Epic of the Soul'' is a groundbreaking contribution to Nietzsche scholarship".&lt;ref&gt;''German Studies Review'', Vol. 29, No. 3 (2006), p. 653&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the work has served as inspiration to at least one study of Nietzsche, Kyle Evan Mask's 2008 MA thesis in Philosophy at Texas A&amp;M University, "Eternal Recurrence and Nature," which applies Seung's Spinozistic reading of Nietzsche to texts beyond ''Zarathustra''.

==Goethe, Nietzsche, and Wagner: Their Spinozan Epics of Love and Power (2006)==

In ''Goethe, Nietzsche, and Wagner: Their Spinozan Epics of Love and Power'', T. K. Seung develops his novel theory of Spinozan epics as first presented in ''Nietzsche’s Epic of the Soul''. In the latter book he systematically examines Nietzsche's text, defining its thematic content as an epic of the soul. He substantiates the theory with historical knowledge of main currents and undercurrents in European philosophy and literature, identifying the Faustian themes in Nietzsche's epic and associating it with Spinozan naturalism.

In a comparative examination of the thematic content of [[Goethe]]’s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', [[Nietzsche]]’s ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra|Zarathustra]]'', and [[Wagner]]’s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'', Seung elucidates how the understanding of Spinoza's pantheistic naturalism, its inspirational background and influences on European philosophy and literature, is indispensable for the understanding of the development and conditions of modern times. The book is the culmination of a lifelong study of the Faustian roots of Western culture. The first step was taken in his study of Dante's ''Divina Commedia'' as an epic of the Trinity as presented in ''The Fragile Leaves of the Sibyl: Dante’s Master Plan'' (1962). In ''Cultural Thematics: The Formation of the Faustian Ethos'' (1976), he showed how the 13th and 14th centuries, in European philosophy and literature, constitute the formative period in the transition of the medieval outlook of Dante's epic to the Faustian view of the Renaissance. The theory was further substantiated in ''Semiotics and Thematics in Hermeneutics'' (1982) and ''Intuition and Construction: The Foundation Normative Theory'' (1993). Now, with his book on the Spinozan epics, Seung brings further clarity to the complex development and conditions of modern times.

==Seung’s Interpretation of Kant’s Philosophy (1969–2007)==

Seung published three books on Kant over the span of thirty-eight years (1969–2007). In ''Kant’s Transcendental Logic'' (1969), he examines Kant's claim that [[transcendental logic]] can generate a priori [[synthetic proposition]]s. He views Kant's transcendental logic as an extension of formal logic. This extension was made by joining formal logic to the pure intuitions of space and time and the pure concepts of understanding. Although his theory of pure intuitions has been discredited by the emergence of non-Euclidean physical geometry, his theory of pure concepts has remained relatively intact. But Seung has exposed a fatal flaw in this theory.

In the Metaphysical Deduction, Kant claims to derive logically his twelve categories from the twelve forms of judgment. It has long been a standard practice to dismiss the Metaphysical Deduction as one of Kant's typical opaque passages and move on to the Transcendental Deduction. Seung argues that this practice leads to a serious misreading of the first ''Critique''. If Kant were to assemble the categories empirically, they could not be distinguished from empirical concepts. For this reason, he openly disdains Aristotle's empirical method of collecting his categories.  By his logical derivation of the categories, Kant believes, he can prove their a priori origin because logic is a priori. With their a priori origin thus proven, Kant intends to use them as the logical premise for the Transcendental Deduction. But Seung shows that Kant's derivation scheme was ill-conceived. The forms of judgment are syntactic elements; the categories are semantic elements. To derive the latter from the former was to derive semantic elements from syntactic elements. Although this was a logically impossible operation, Kant proudly flaunted it as his ingenious invention. Unfortunately, his ingenuity thrived only in exploiting his logical fantasy. Seung has dissected a series of fraudulent maneuvers in his derivation of the categories. But the fraud was recognized neither by the performer nor by the audience because it was executed in an obscure tricky language.

Kant's [[apriorism]] has generally been taken as the central theme of his philosophy. But Seung has discovered one more enduring theme alongside it.  This is the topic of ''Kant’s Platonic Revolution in Moral and Political Philosophy'' (1994), in which Seung explores the importance of [[Platonism]] for Kant. In his Inaugural Dissertation, Seung says, Kant expressed his enthusiasm over Platonic Ideas for the first time in his life. Although Kant launched his project of [[Critical Philosophy]] in the first ''Critique'', he reaffirmed his earlier allegiance to normative Platonism in the Transcendental Dialectic, where he included Platonic Ideas in the pure concepts of reason.  He emphatically distinguished the pure concepts of reason from the categories of understanding. Although the categories were indispensable for understanding phenomena, he maintained, they were useless for practical reason because they provided no normative standards. In the practical domain, he says, one cannot take a single step without appealing to Platonic Ideas as the ultimate normative principles.

By the time Kant wrote the ''Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals'', he appeared to have completely disowned his normative Platonism. He does not even mention Platonic Ideas and tries to spin out moral rules by purely formal principles, which can have no connection with any transcendent entities such as Platonic Ideas. Consequently, Kant scholars have rarely recognized the relevance of Platonism for his ethics. Against this prevailing tradition, Seung has textually demonstrated that Platonism was an essential element in ''Critique of Practical Reason'' and ''Metaphysics of Morals'', Kant's two ethical treatises after the ''Groundwork''. Plato's influence is not limited to his ethical writings. Seung has shown that Platonic Ideas also play a critical role in the third ''Critique'' and in Kant's philosophy of history. He finally concludes that the entire tradition of [[German Idealism]] has grown out of Kant's enthusiasm with Platonic Ideas.

''Kant: A Guide for the Perplexed'' (2007) provides an overview of Kant's philosophical development. This development has been understood as his struggle to reconcile [[continental rationalism]] and [[British empiricism]], which has produced his a priori formalism. But this is only one half of the story, according to Seung; the other half is Kant's normative Platonism. In Kant's own language, Seung says, his philosophy consists of two types of elements: transcendent and transcendental. The transcendental elements are a priori and innate to the subject of experience. The transcendent elements transcend the world of experience. The former was Kant's appropriation of the Cartesian legacy; the latter was his adaptation of the Platonic legacy.

To reconcile these two legacies turned out to be a far more difficult task for Kant than the task of reconciling empiricism and rationalism. In his general scheme of synthesis, empiricism and rationalism complements each other like two sides of a single body, but the Platonic and the Cartesian legacies behave like two bodies of conjoined twins. Their harmonious union was so intractable that Kant had to revise it many times over and yet never achieved a satisfactory resolution. Seung supports this verdict by solid textual evidence. Although his three ''Critiques'' have traditionally been taken as three interlocking segments of his architectonic system, he points out, their interconnection is rarely, if ever, discussed in Kant scholarship. In fact, he says, Kant scholarship has been divided into three tightly segregated compartments, each of which clusters around one of the three ''Critiques'' and conducts its business without even considering the business of the other two. Obviously, there is no way to fit those three pieces together into a single edifice.

Seung has suggested that the most sensible way to read the three ''Critiques'' is to take them as Kant's three attempts to bring together his a priori formalism and his normative Platonism. In fact, to write more than one ''Critique'' was not his original design. He had assumed that ''Critique of Pure Reason'' was sufficient for laying the foundation for his Critical Philosophy because there was only one pure reason. On the basis of this foundation, he was planning to write two metaphysical treatises: Metaphysics of Nature and Metaphysics of Morals. Instead of writing these two treatises, he changed his mind about the first ''Critique'' and wrote the second ''Critique''. But he did not stop there. He changed his mind once more and wrote the third ''Critique''. Even the first ''Critique'' marked a huge change of heart, which had terminated his dogmatic slumber in the Inaugural Dissertation. Seung textually substantiates these three revolutions in the development of Kant's philosophy.

Seung concludes the preface to his Kant with the following observation: "Thus the three Critiques stand as the milestones for marking the three successive philosophical revisions. Therefore, it is a grievous error to regard them as three segments of a single unified architecture, as is conventionally understood in Kant scholarship. These three pieces can never be joined together in a single edifice because they are structurally incompatible with each other. Their connection can be understood only thematically because they mark the thematic development of Kant’s transcendental philosophy." Thus Seung has launched a revolution in Kant scholarship by highlighting the hitherto neglected Kant's normative Platonism and elucidating its dialectical tension with his a priori formalism. This was the irresolvable conflict between his own transcendentalism and Plato's ancient transcendentism. He had to abandon one of them for the integrity of the other. Ironically, this has been accomplished by Kant scholars by blithely closing their eyes to the Platonic dimension of his philosophy. But he could not muster the courage to make the decisive move on his own. So he was destined to struggle with the two-headed monster of his own creation to the end of his life. This is Seung's startling account of Kant's profound epic struggle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8360">{{Nihongo|'''Takaaki Yoshimoto'''|吉本 隆明|''Yoshimoto Takaaki''|extra=25 November 1924&amp;nbsp;– 16 March 2012}} also known as ''Ryūmei Yoshimoto'', was a [[Japanese poet]], [[literary critic]], and [[philosopher]] from Tokyo. He is the father of Japanese writer [[Banana Yoshimoto]] and of cartoonist [[Yoiko Haruno]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kyodo-2012|Kyodo News (2012)]], second-to-last paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}

Yoshimoto was born in 1924, in Tsukishima, Tokyo. His family were boatmakers who had moved from Amakusa, [[Kumamoto]] prefecture, making small rental boats. In his teens Yoshimoto came under the influence of literature while receiving private tutoring, and began to write poetry in his teens. He was influenced by the work of [[Takamura Kotaro]] and [[Miyazawa Kenji]]. He was a 'militarist youth' during the war, but experienced the end of the war while mobilized for manual labor, and thereon became fascinated by [[Marxism]].

Yoshimoto attended Tashima Elementary School in the Kyobashi Ward of Tokyo, Yonezawa Engineering School (Now [[Yamagata University]]), and graduated in 1947 from the Engineering Division of [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]] with a degree in Electrochemistry. During his studies, he became acquainted with the Mathematician Toyama Hiraku.

After graduation, Yoshimoto moved to industry, became a research student in 1950, and in 1952 took a position at [[Tokyo Ink Manufacturing Company Ltd.]] He continued his poetic output, writing his first representative works, ''Dialogue with Particularity'' and ''Ten Works for a Change in Position'', and won the [[Arechi]] prize for new poets. He published a work of criticism, On [[Takamura Kotaro]].

==As a father figure to the New Left==

Yoshimoto, who had pursued a theory of war responsibility of the literati, supported the movement against the 1960 [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|Anpo treaty]] as an expression of the contradictions of the postwar order fifteen years after the end of the war. He was an "enthusiastic supporter" of the [[Zengakuren]], and gave a lecture at the June 15, 1960 resistance assembly inside the National Diet.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cassegard|Cassegard]], section "Maruyama Masao", final paragraph&lt;/ref&gt; Yoshimoto was arrested in the incident which followed,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cassegard|Cassegard]], section "Maruyama Masao", final paragraph&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in deaths from clashes with the police who had arrived to suppress it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Afterward, Yoshimoto founded the magazine ''Shikkou'' with the like-minded Tanigawa Gan and Murakami Ichiro. The journal published articles by Miura Tsutomu, who had been expelled from the Communist Party after the [[critique of Stalin]], his disciple Takimura Ryuichi, Nango Tsugumasa, and others. Edazawa Shunsuke and others made their debuts as critics in Shikkou. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Yoshimoto developed a positive theoretical discourse in the midst of the collapse of the Communist Party's heroic status and splits in the new left. Yoshimoto was widely read and supported by students and intellectuals, for his work in ''The Decline of a False System'' (1962), which developed an independent theory of the arts in the face of criticisms of the Communist Party and sectarian literary theories, emphasizing the aesthetics of language and psychological phenomena, and his concept of {{nihongo||共同幻想|kyoudou gensou|"communal fantasy"}}, describing how the propaganda and militarism of the wartime era "swept away virtually the entire population in a wave of war frenzy".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cassegard|Cassegard]], section "Yoshimoto Takaaki and the celebration of privatization", first paragraph&lt;/ref&gt; This became a refuge for students and intellectuals exasperated by the then-current sectarian and bureaucratic Marxism. Yoshimoto's collected works were published beginning in 1968.

As a result, Yoshimoto's anti-sectarian philosophy of independence became a major influence and theoretical resource in the 1960s and 1970s for the Zengakuren, Zenkyoto, and other 'non-sect' New Leftists, and Yoshimoto came to be seen as an ancestor for some New Left activists.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cassegard|Cassegard]], section "Yoshimoto Takaaki and the celebration of privatization", first paragraph&lt;/ref&gt; This was in spite of his critical stance in relation to the protest and activism movement of the 60's, a stance which is a consequence of his aversion to sectarianism and party-driven movements, which he may have considered a form of {{nihongo||共同幻想|kyoudou gensou|"communal fantasy"}} similar to that which had led Japan to war in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cassegard|Cassegard]], section "Yoshimoto Takaaki and the celebration of privatization", first paragraph.  Yoshimoto's status as an influential figure to the New Left is contrasted with his criticisms of the activism of the era&lt;/ref&gt;  Yoshimoto gave qualified support to the activities of Zenkyoto.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==From the 1980s==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}

Beginning in the 1980s, Yoshimoto published a theory of the masses, ''The Mass Image'', and particular a theory of the city in ''The High Image I-III''. At this time, Yoshimoto appeared in the women's magazine ''[[AnAn]]'' wearing clothing by [[Comme des Garçons]].  Criticized by Haniya Yutaka as "wearing capitalism itself", Yoshimoto was criticized for turning right. Indeed, afterwards Yoshimoto did become more politically conservative, becoming a supporter of [[Ichirō Ozawa]].

In the latter part of the 1980s, Yoshimoto criticized the anti-nuclear power and anti-nuclear weapons movements started by intellectual advocates of postwar democracy such as [[Kenzaburō Ōe]] as 'Anti-Nuclear Fascism".

In the 1990s, after characterizing the yoga practices of [[Asahara Shoko]] of [[Aum Shinrikyo]] as expressing the inner core of early Buddhist asceticism, Yoshimoto was criticized along with [[Nakazawa Shin'ichi]] as a defender of Aum following the [[Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway]].

In August 1996, Yoshimoto was in critical condition after falling unconscious while swimming in Toicho, Shizuoka Prefecture, but survived. After the mid-1990s, his work tended towards informal essays.

In 2003, he won the [[Kobayashi Hideo]] Prize for his book ''Reading [[Natsume Sōseki]]'' (夏目漱石を読む), and his collected works received the Fujimura Memorial prize.

==Philosophy and reception==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}

Yoshimoto was a wide-ranging author who wrote on literature, [[subculture]], politics, society, and religion (including [[Shinran]] and the [[New Testament]]).

Yoshimoto is known as a giant of postwar thought, and had an enormous influence in the 1960s and 1970s in Japan. He published many dialogues with overseas intellectuals visiting Japan, such as [[Michel Foucault]], [[Félix Guattari]], [[Ivan Illich]], and [[Jean Baudrillard]].

Yoshimoto, who did not hold an academic pedigree, supported intellectuals who have devoted themselves to solitary study.
He has also engaged in a number of belligerent exchanges. Famous among these have been his dispute with Hanada Kiyoteru, with [[New Testament]] scholar Tagawa Kenzo, and his former friend and critic Haniya Yutaka.

{{Avicenna sidebar}}
'''''The Incoherence of the Philosophers''''' (تهافت الفلاسفة ''Tahāfut al-Falāsifaʰ'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) is the title of a landmark 11th-century work by the Persian theologian [[Al-Ghazali]] and a student of the [[Ash'ari|Asharite]] school of [[Islamic theology]] criticizing the [[Avicennism|Avicennian]] school of [[early Islamic philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;{{Citation|last= |first= | authorlink= | title=Avicenna |year=| encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica | accessdate=2007-12-30|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-i}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Muslim philosophers|Muslim philosophers]] such as [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna) and [[Al-Farabi]] (Alpharabius) are denounced in this book. The belief that all causal events and interactions are not the product of material conjunctions but rather the immediate and present Will of God, underlies the work.{{cn|date=June 2016}} The text was dramatically successful, and marked a milestone in the ascendance of the Asharite school within [[Islamic philosophy]] and theological discourse.

The book favors [[faith]] over [[philosophy]] in matters specifically concerning [[metaphysics]] or knowledge of the divine.

==Background==
This book was preceded by a summary of [[Islamic philosophy|Muslim philosophical]] thought titled: [[The Aims of the Philosophers|Aims of the philosophers]] (''[[Maqasid al Falasifa]]''). This book is the summary of [[Avicennism|Avicenna's philosophical doctrine]].&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; [[Al-Ghazali]] stated that one must be well versed in the ideas of the philosophers before setting out to refute their ideas.

[[Al-Ghazali]] also stated that he did not find other branches of philosophy including physics, logic, astronomy or mathematics problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ghazali|first=Al|title=The Incoherence of the Philosophers|year=2000|publisher=Brigham Young UP|isbn=0-8425-2466-5 |pages=5–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; His only dispute was with metaphysics, in which he claimed that the philosophers did not use the same tools, namely logic, which they used for other sciences. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Contents==
The work is organized into 20 chapters in which al-Ghazali attempts to refute Avicenna's doctrines.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

He states that Avicenna and his followers have erred in seventeen points (each one of which he addresses in detail in a chapter, for a total of 17 chapters) by committing heresy. But in three other chapters, he accuses them of being utterly irreligious. Among the charges that he leveled against the philosophers is their inability to prove the existence of God and inability to prove the impossibility of the existence of two gods.

The twenty points are as follows:
#Refuting the doctrine of the world's pre-eternity.
#Refuting the doctrine of the world's post-eternity.
#Showing their equivocation of the following two statements: God is the creator of the world vs. the world is God's creation.
#The inability of philosophers to prove the existence of the Creator. 
#The inability of philosophers to prove the impossibility of the existence of two gods.
#The philosopher's doctrine of denying the existence of God's attributes.
#Refutation of their statement: "the essence of the First is not divisible into genus and species".
#Refutation of their statement: "the First is simple existent without quiddity".
#Their inability to demonstrate that the First is not a body.
#Discussing their materialist doctrine necessitates a denial of the maker. 
#Their inability to show that the First knows others.
#Their inability to show that the First knows Himself.
#Refuting that the First does not know the Particulars.
#Refuting their doctrine that states: "the heavens are an animal that moves on its own volition".
#Refuting what they say regarding the reason that the heavens move.
#Refuting their doctrine that the heavens are souls that know the particulars.
#Refuting their doctrine that disruption of causality is impossible.
#Refuting their statement that the human soul is a self-sustaining substance that is neither a body nor an accident.
#Refuting their assertion of the impossibility of the annihilation of the human soul.
#Refuting their denial of bodily resurrection and the accompanying pleasures of Paradise or the pains of Hellfire.

===Beyond heresy===
Among the twenty points, al-Ghazali called out three which he charges not only constitute heresy, but also disbelief in Islam.&lt;ref name="Leaman2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaman|first=Oliver |title=An Introduction to Classical Islamic Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=em9zwASotOkC|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-79757-3|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The theory of a pre-eternal world. Ghazali wrote that God created the world in time and just like everything in this world time will cease to exist as well, but God will continue on existing.
# God only knows the universal characteristics of particulars - namely Platonic forms.
# Bodily resurrection will not take place in the hereafter, only human souls are resurrected.

===Occasionalism===
''The Incoherence of the Philosophers'' propounds the [[Ash'ari|Asharite]] theory of [[occasionalism]]. Al-Ghazali wrote that when fire and cotton are placed in contact, the cotton is burned directly by God rather than by the fire, a claim which he defended using [[logic in Islamic philosophy]].

He explained that because God is usually seen as rational, rather than arbitrary, his behavior in normally causing events in the same sequence (i.e., what appears to us to be efficient causation) can be understood as a natural outworking of that principle of reason, which we then describe as the [[Physical law|laws of nature]]. Properly speaking, however, these are not laws of nature but laws by which God chooses to govern his own behaviour (his autonomy, in the strict sense) – in other words, his rational will.

===Cosmology and astronomy===
{{see also|Islamic cosmology|Astronomy in medieval Islam}}

Al-Ghazali expresses his support for a [[scientific method]]ology based on [[Scientific demonstration|demonstration]] and [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]], while discussing astronomy. After describing the [[solar eclipse]] and the [[lunar eclipse]], he writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Anwar|first=Sabieh|date=October 2008|title=Is Ghazālī really the Halagu of Science in Islam?|journal=[[Al-Mawrid|Monthly Renaissance]]|volume=18|issue=10|url=http://www.monthly-renaissance.com/issue/content.aspx?id=1016|accessdate=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Whosoever thinks that to engage in a [[disputation]] for refuting such a theory is a religious duty harms religion and weakens it. For these matters rest on demonstrations, geometrical and arithmetical, that leave no room for doubt.}}

In his defense of the Asharite doctrine of a [[Islamic creationism|created universe]] that is [[Temporal finitism|temporally finite]], against the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] doctrine of an eternal universe, Al-Ghazali proposed the [[Modal realism|modal]] theory of [[possible world]]s, arguing that their actual world is the [[best of all possible worlds]] from among all the [[alternate timeline]]s and [[World history|world histories]] that God could have possibly created. His theory parallels that of [[Duns Scotus]] in the 14th century. While it is uncertain whether Al-Ghazali had any influence on Scotus, they both may have derived their theory from their readings of [[Avicenna]]'s ''Metaphysics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Possible Worlds in the Tahâfut al-Falâsifa: Al-Ghazâlî on Creation and Contingency|author=Taneli Kukkonen|journal=[[Journal of the History of Philosophy]]|volume=38|issue=4|year=2000|pages=479–502|doi=10.1353/hph.2005.0033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
{{Main|The Incoherence of the Incoherence|Hayy ibn Yaqdhan}}

[[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes) wrote a refutation of Al-Ghazali's work entitled ''[[The Incoherence of the Incoherence]]'' (''Tahāfut al-Tahāfut'') in which he defends the doctrines of the philosophers and criticizes al-Ghazali's own arguments.  It is written as a sort of dialogue: Averroes quotes passages by al-Ghazali and then responds to them.  This text was not as well received by the wider Islamic audience.{{clarification needed|date=July 2016}} In the 15th century, a refutation of Ibn Rushd’s arguments in ''Tahāfut al-Tahāfut'' was written by a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] scholar [[Mustafā Ibn Yūsuf al-Bursawī]], also known as Khwājah Zādā (d. 1487), who defended al-Ghazali's views. This once again indicated to Islamic scholars the weakness of human understanding and the strength of faith.&lt;ref name=Ahmad&gt;{{citation|last=Ahmad|first=Jamil|date=September 1994|title=Ibn Rushd|journal=[[Al-Mawrid|Monthly Renaissance]]|volume=4|issue=9|url=http://www.monthly-renaissance.com/issue/content.aspx?id=744|accessdate=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another less critical response to Al-Ghazali's arguments was written by Ibn Rushd's predecessor [[Ibn Tufail]] (Abubacer) as part of his [[Arabic literature|Arabic philosophical novel]], ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqzan]]'' (later translated into [[Latin]] and [[English language|English]] as ''Philosophus Autodidactus''). Ibn Tufail cites al-Ghazali as an influence on his novel, especially his views on Sufism, but was critical of his views against Avicennism. [[Ibn al-Nafis]] later wrote another novel, ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]'', as a response to Ibn Tufail's ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', defending some of al-Ghazali's views.

==Legacy==
Al-Ghazali's insistence on a radical divine [[immanence]] in the natural world has been posited&lt;ref&gt;"Myth 4. That Medieval Islamic Culture was Inhospitable to Science" in Ronald L. Numbers (ed.): ''Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion'', Harvard University Press, 2009, esp. pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the reasons that the spirit of [[Models of scientific inquiry|scientific inquiry]] later withered in Islamic lands.  If "Allah's hand is not chained", then there was no point in discovering the alleged laws of nature.  For example:

{{Quote | ...our opponent claims that the agent of the burning is the fire exclusively; this is a natural, not a voluntary agent, and cannot abstain from what is in its nature when it is brought into contact with a receptive substratum. This we deny, saying: The agent of the burning is God, through His creating the black in the cotton and the disconnexion of its parts, and it is God who made the cotton burn and made it ashes either through the intermediation of angels or without intermediation.  For fire is a dead body which has no action, and what is the proof that it is the agent? Indeed, the philosophers have no other proof than the observation of the occurrence of the burning, when there is contact with fire, but observation proves only a simultaneity, not a causation, and, in reality, there is no other cause but God.}}

The Ottoman sultan [[Mehmed II]] (a.k.a. ''el-Fatih'') once commissioned two of the realm's scholars to write a book summarizing the ideas of the two great philosophers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Learman|first=Oliver|title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Islamic Philosophy|year=2006|publisher=Thoemmes|isbn=1843711486 |pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; as to who won the debate across time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Islam And Scientific Debate: Searching For Legitimacy | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7U2mS6QHVkkC&amp;lpg=PA29 | publisher = Global Vision | first =Sakir | last = Kocabas|authorlink=Islam and Science |location=India|page=29|year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ștefan Zeletin''' (born '''Ștefan Motăș'''; June 19, 1882 &amp;ndash; July 20, 1934) was a [[Romania]]n [[philosopher]], sociologist, liberal economist and political theorist.

==Biography==

Born in [[Răchitoasa|Burdusaci]], [[Bacău County]], his mother Catinca Motăș (''née'' Chiriac) was the daughter of Ștefanache Chiriac, a local official of Greek origin from the nearby village of [[Motoșeni|Ursa]]. Her husband, the ''[[postelnic]]'' Dumitrache Motăș, died sixteen years before Zeletin's birth. The latter's father is unknown (one possibility is the local mayor and well-off landowner Neculache Brăescu), and he remained sensitive to the fact of his illegitimate birth, adopting a pseudonym (after the [[Zeletin River (Berheci)|Zeletin River]] that passes through Burdusaci) to distance himself from his mother's husband. He grew up in a peasant family of the bourgeoisie, which he would later analyze in his work.&lt;ref name="radu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Sorin Rădulescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/o_carte_despre_tefan_zeletin "O carte despre Ștefan Zeletin"], in ''România Literară'', Nr. 39/2002&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended [[Gheorghe Roșca Codreanu National College|Codreanu High School]] in [[Bârlad]] and the theological seminary in [[Roman, Romania|Roman]]. His tertiary studies took place at the [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza University|University of Iași]] (1906), [[Humboldt University of Berlin|of Berlin]] (1907–1908), [[University of Paris|Paris]] (1909–1910), [[Leipzig University|Leipzig]] (1910), Berlin (1910–1911) and [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen]] (1911).&lt;ref name="radu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="e198"/&gt; After taking his doctorate from the latter university in 1912, on the subject of idealism in contemporary English philosophy and advised by [[Richard Falckenberg]],&lt;ref name="radu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="e198"/&gt;&lt;ref name="constandache"&gt;Constandache, p.289&lt;/ref&gt; he returned to Romania and taught German at Codreanu. He started publishing soon after, with ''Evanghelia naturii'' ("The Gospel of Nature") coming out at Iași in 1915, and ''Din țara măgarilor'' ("From the Country of the Donkeys") appearing in 1916.&lt;ref name="e198"/&gt; An allegorical work about a population of "donkeys" that borders the Bulgarians, it drew an angry response from [[Nicolae Iorga]], who signed his review "someone who is not a donkey"; others praised the pamphlet for its insightful analysis of Romanian society.&lt;ref&gt;Ersoy, p.199&lt;/ref&gt; One scope of the work was to ridicule Romanian pretensions over [[Southern Dobruja]], which the country had gained as a result of the [[Second Balkan War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} George Ungureanu, [http://www.centrul-cultural-pitesti.ro/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=828:file-de-istorie&amp;catid=254:restituiri-3-2007&amp;Itemid=118 "Problema Cadrilaterului - Diferendum territorial și repere imagologice (1913-1940)"], ''Restituiri'', 3/2007&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to the national capital [[Bucharest]] in 1920, continuing to work as a German teacher,&lt;ref name="e198"/&gt; at [[Mihai Viteazul National College (Bucharest)|Mihai Viteazul High School]].&lt;ref name="radu"/&gt;

His most important volume of sociology, ''[[Burghezia română]]'' ("The Romanian Bourgeoisie"), was published in 1925. Two years later, he became a philosophy professor at the University of Iași.&lt;ref name="e198"/&gt; His last book, ''Nirvana'' (1928), deals with his understanding of philosophy as correlated with poetry, with philosophy's influence on his outlook and its being a source of inspiration for him. The work revisited themes found in the earlier ''Evanghelia naturii''.&lt;ref&gt;Constandache, p.290&lt;/ref&gt; A sympathizer of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]], with leading member [[Vintilă Brătianu]] a backer of his theories, Zeletin nevertheless joined the [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's Party]].&lt;ref name="e198"/&gt; He carried on a correspondence with several prominent intellectuals, including Iorga, [[Vasile Bogrea]], [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]], [[Gheorghe I. Brătianu]], [[Nicolae Bagdasar]], and his close friend [[Cezar Papacostea]].&lt;ref name="radu"/&gt; He became gravely ill in 1930 and died four years later.&lt;ref name="e198"/&gt; He was buried in Bucharest's Sfânta Vineri Cemetery by his brother Dimitrie Motăș, aided by Papacostea and Bagdasar. He never married and had no children.&lt;ref&gt;Zeletin, p.47&lt;/ref&gt; A popular theorist of [[neoliberalism]] in the 1930s and 1940s, his ideas were shunned after the onset of [[Communist Romania|the Communist regime]] in 1947. His works again began to see publication as part of anthologies in the 1970s, when his work on social development theory was re-evaluated. Following the [[Romanian Revolution|1989 fall of communism]], his work reappeared in proper form and his ideas reentered debates about political ideology and national identity.&lt;ref name="e198"&gt;Ersoy, p.198&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

Intellectual debates in [[interwar]] Romania were dominated by "traditionalists", who argued that the country should look to its past for its road to development; and "Europeanists", who said the industrialized and urbanized West pointed the economic and social way forward. Among the latter camp, while [[Eugen Lovinescu]] wrote about the transformative power of ideas, Zeletin focused on the importance of economics in ''Burghezia română''.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins 2013, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; There, he argued that the 1829 [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] had loosened the [[Danubian Principalities]] from the constricting influence of long [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] domination, producing the fundamental economic changes that gave rise to modern Romania.&lt;ref name="h162"&gt;Hitchins 2014, p.162&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out how, following the 1859 [[United Principalities|Union of the Principalities]], massive Western investment had led to the emergence of a bourgeois middle class composed of ''[[boyar]]s'' who had turned to trade, and of a capitalist economy. Moreover, he argued that continued industrialization and adoption of European technology, guided by this class, were necessary for Romania to avoid retrenchment.&lt;ref name="h162"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p.88-89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="m44"/&gt;

He drew on the theories of [[Werner Sombart]], who posited that foreigners bring capitalism to countries embarking on a course of modernization, which at a later stage rebel against perceived foreign domination.&lt;ref&gt;Petreu, p.193&lt;/ref&gt; Zeletin placed early-1920s Romania at this second stage, thus explaining the "nationalism of reaction" that was "xenophobic, in particular anti-Semitic", directed against [[Romanian Jews|the country's Jewish community]].&lt;ref&gt;Petreu, p.194&lt;/ref&gt; Prophetically, he suggested that Romanians would "attempt to emancipate themselves from foreign patronage, in order to live on their own strength"; he died before the worst of the country's xenophobic and anti-Semitic reaction had displayed itself.&lt;ref&gt;Petreu, p.194-95&lt;/ref&gt;

He saw the liberal forms the country had adopted as being not artificial, but well-adapted to his society's current stage of development. Adopting a semi-[[Marxist]] discourse, Zeletin held that modern capitalism was a "historical necessity" both unavoidable and not subject to criticism.&lt;ref name="m44"&gt;Mishkova and Daskalov, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, he viewed traditional Romanian culture as reactionary.&lt;ref&gt;Mishkova and Daskalov, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; Among ''Burghezia română'''s admirers were Ibrăileanu, [[Tudor Vianu]], [[Alexandru Claudian]] and [[Constantin Noica]].&lt;ref name="constandache"/&gt;

In ''Neoliberalismul'' (1927), he proposed a scientific definition of neoliberalism, enumerated its effects and identified the impediments to its gaining political currency in Romania&amp;mdash;popular prejudice on the one hand, and on the other, doctrines such as [[Junimea|Junimism]], nationalism, [[Poporanism]] and socialism. [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]], [[Nae Ionescu]], [[Virgil Madgearu]] and [[Nicolae Roșu]] accused him of holding materialist, Marxist or socialist views.&lt;ref name="constandache"/&gt;
