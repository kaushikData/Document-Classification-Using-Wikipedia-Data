'''''Active Exploits''''' is a [[diceless role-playing game|diceless]] set of role-playing game rules by [[Precis Intermedia Gaming]]. The core rules (which contain no setting) are distributed for free as a [[pdf]] file, or for a fee as a printed book. There are a number of published game settings and official game conversions which use these rules.

The system is considered innovative, but more in common with [[GURPS]] and [[Unisystem]], rather than other diceless games such as [[Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game|Amber]] and [[Nobilis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| accessdate = 2007-10-27
| url = http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/11/11964.phtml
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game has options for [[freeform role-playing|freeform]] and [[live action role-playing]], as well as for converting the game to other systems.  Ample conversion rules allow the adaptation of the engine to a number of commercial systems.

== Published Settings and Official Conversions ==
Active Exploit has converted other published RPGs into diceless versions.

{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2014}}
'''Assemblage''' refers to a text "built primarily and explicitly from existing texts to solve a writing or communication problem in a new context".&lt;ref&gt;Selber and Johnson-Eilola, Plagiarism, Originality, Assemblage, Computers and Composition, Vol. 24, No. 4. (2007), pp. 375–403&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was first proposed by Johndan Johnson-Eilola (author of ''[[Datacloud]]'') and Stuart Selber in the [[Academic journal|journal]] ''Computers &amp; Composition'' in 2007.  The notion of assemblages builds on [[remix]] and remix practices, which blur distinctions between invented and borrowed [[Literature|work]].

==In composition==
Johnson-Eilola and Selber write that assemblage is influenced by [[intertextuality]] and [[postmodernism]].  The authors discuss the intertextual nature of writing and assert that participation in existing [[discourse]] necessarily means that [[composition (language)|composition]] cannot occur separate from that discourse.  They state that "productive participation involves appropriation and re-appropriation of the familiar" in a manner that conforms to existing discourse and audience expectations.  In reference to intertextuality, Johnson-Eilola and Selber cite ''[[The Social Life of Information]]'' by [[John Seely Brown]] and [[Paul Duguid]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, John Seely, &amp; Duguid, Paul. (2000). The social life of information. Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this book Brown and Duguid state that the meaning of and use for a text is directly influenced both by its source texts and the broader textual context in which it participates.  Building upon this notion, Johnson-Eilola and Selber position assemblage as a style of composition situated within postmodernism.  They state that "in a general sense, postmodern theories, and following them, [[cultural studies]], offer a useful way of understanding assemblages (and the related process of remixing) as simultaneously social and textual structures."  Johnson-Eilola and Selber suggest that texts should always be treated as assemblages since composition is often highly intertextual.

Johnson-Eilola and Selber believe that composition should be undertaken as a problem solving activity rather than a demonstration of original ideas. They write that "writing situations are, at base, problem-solving situations in one way or another," and offer assemblage as a form of problem solving that can be used alongside the creation of original text.  Michael J. Michaud writes that "assemblages are ubiquitous in contemporary workplaces" where problem solving is paramount because assemblage allows authors to "meet discursive needs and to get work done."&lt;ref&gt;Michaud, Michael J, The 'Reverse Commute: Adult Students and the Transition from Professional to Academic Literacy, Teaching English in the Two Year College, Vol. 38, No. 4. (2011), pp. 244–257.&lt;/ref&gt; He further argues that students with workplace experience often transfer assemblage writing into the composition classroom.  Assemblage allows such authors to alter existing texts and combine them with original work in order to meet the demands of a writing situation or problem.

==Assemblage and remix==
The idea of assemblages is closely tied to the practice of remix.  Remix, originally referring to a reworked song, has been extended to describe any significant alteration of media, most commonly film and literature.  Johnson-Eilola and Selber claim that remix "can aid invention, leverage intellectual and physical resources, and dramatize the social dimensions of composing."  However, they also recognize that "remixing as a form of composition inhabits a contested terrain of creativity, intellectual property, authorship, corporate ownership, and power."  While the practice of remixing is often marked by [[copyright|legal]] issues, the authors acknowledge that remix is nevertheless becoming an increasingly common creative form.

While assemblage is closely tied to remix, there are distinctions between the two.  In discussing models of writing, Liane Robertson, Kara Taczak, and Kathleen Blake Yancey describe remix models of writing as "prior knowledge revised synthetically to ''incorporate'' new concepts and practices into the prior model of writing."&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Liane, Kara Taczak, and Kathleen Blake Yancey, Notes Towards a Theory of Prior Knowledge and Its Role in College Composers' Transfer of Knowledge and Practice, Composition Forum, Vol. 26. (2012), np. http://compositionforum.com/issue/26/prior-knowledge-transfer.php&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, they define assemblage models as “grafting...isolated ‘bits’ of learning onto [a] prior structure without either recognition of differences between prior and current writing conceptions and tasks or synthesis of them."  While a remix is a [[wikt:synthesis|synthesis]] or incorporation of elements, an assemblage is a combination in which there are recognizable boundaries between elements.

Assemblage and remix are also related to [[articulation (sociology)|articulation]].  The sociological practice of articulation, as described by [[Antonio Gramsci]] and [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], among others, refers to the [[appropriation (sociology)|appropriation]] of elements of culture by various social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Stuart. (1986). On postmodernism and articulation: An interview with Stuart Hall (Lawrence Grossberg, Ed.) Journal of Communication Inquiry, 5, 35–60. Rpt. in Stuart Hall: Critical dialogues in cultural studies. (1996). David Morley &amp; Kuan-Hsing Chen (Eds.). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson-Eilola and Selber connect assemblage, remix, and articulation as examples of meaning being situated in a specific material and social context.

==Assemblage and plagiarism==
A central characteristic of assemblages is the challenge to established notions of [[originality]]. Johnson-Eilola and Selber claim that the traditional distinction between original and [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] work is that original work is superior in terms of creative effort and is not [[derivative work|derivative.]] They further assert that such a distinction is based upon outdated notions of "the lone genius" and is no longer practical in an academic setting. While they concede that "teachers no longer evaluate writing completely as an isolated, decontextualized artifact," Johnson-Eilola and Selber maintain "at least one set of social forces suggests to students that using citations and quotations from source materials will be valued less than their own original text, a situation that may encourage them to conceal their sources."  While the current system of academic evaluation allows, and actually calls, for citation of source materials, Johnson-Eilola and Selber find that the placement of value on original work encourages students to hide sources in an attempt to demonstrate original thought. The emphasis on original work, according to Johnson-Eilola and Selber, may actually contribute to plagiarism. The authors believe that the emphasis on original work is unnecessary because "rhetorical purposes can be addressed in context by either original or borrowed/quoted texts without a hierarchy of distinction between the two."

Johnson-Eilola and Selber assert that despite shifting attitudes in academia, work produced by students at the scholastic and collegiate level is still evaluated in terms of its originality. They find fault with the current evaluative process for two reasons. First, the authors find that evaluating students for their originality is "increasingly unrealistic in our postmodern age" as this method is based on antiquated ideas of creativity. Second, they treat the idea of isolating a student's unique composition from the inspiring source materials as unrealistic and futile.  For Johnson-Eilola and Selber, the ability to effectively contribute to academic or social discourse is what makes an assemblage valuable, not its "originality." Rather than claiming originality is not to be valued, the authors see it as fundamentally problematic and misleading as an evaluative concept. They suggest that academic evaluation be reconsidered with a new emphasis on affect: "What if the 'final' product a student produces—a text—is not concerned with original words or images on a page or screen but concerned primarily with assemblages of parts? Importantly, in this reconception, the assemblages do not distinguish primarily between which parts are supposed to be original and which have been found and gathered from someplace else; assemblages are interested in what works, what has social effects." In this model, the role of intertextuality is recognized as central to the composition of "new" material.

In support for their argument against the traditional view of plagiarism, Johnson-Eilola and Selber cite current critiques from other scholars. They refer to Price, who argued that plagiarism cannot be defined as a single concept, but is dependent upon the cultural practice and conventions in a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Margaret. (2002). Beyond ‘gotcha!’: Situating plagiarism in policy and pedagogy. College Composition and Communication, 54, 88–115.&lt;/ref&gt;  They also acknowledge a presentation given by James Porter in 2006 at [[Conference on College Composition and Communication|CCCC]]. In his presentation Porter described how plagiarism is sometimes encouraged in the academic community, offering examples of "ways teachers plagiarize all the time—among them, sharing syllabi (with plagiarized plagiarism statements!), using [[boilerplate (text)|boilerplate]] text for administrative documents, and failing to acknowledge the [[bibliography|bibliographic]] work of others."&lt;ref&gt;Porter, James E. (2006). Forget plagiarism, teach filesharing and fair use. Paper presented at the convention of the Conference on College Composition and Communication, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson-Eilola and Selber also refer to a 1993 article by Rebecca Moore Howard on "patchwriting," which describes a technique used by new authors. Patchwriting "involves copying from a source text then deleting some words, altering grammatical structures, or plugging in one-to-one synonym-substitutes."&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Rebecca Moore. (2000). Sexuality, textuality: The cultural work of plagiarism. College English, 62, 37–55&lt;/ref&gt; This technique can traditionally be viewed as a form of plagiarism, but it is also considered useful for learning how to communicate within expert discourse. Johson-Eilola and Selber reference patchwriting in an attempt to demonstrate the practical uses of otherwise "plagiaristic" practices, not to establish a connection between patchwriting and assemblage. While patchwriting can be a useful learning tool, it is completely distinct from assemblage. Assemblage is more than the systematic replacement of like terms and is closer to the artistic style of [[collage]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4217">In [[mathematical logic]], an '''axiom schema''' (plural: '''axiom schemata''' or '''axiom schemas''') generalizes the notion of [[axiom]].

==Formal definition==
An axiom schema is a [[well-formed formula|formula]] in the [[metalanguage]] of an [[axiomatic system]], in which one or more [[schematic variable]]s appear. These variables, which are metalinguistic constructs, stand for any [[First-order logic#Formation rules|term]] or [[first-order logic|subformula]] of the system, which may or may not be required to satisfy certain conditions. Often, such conditions require that certain variables be [[free variable|free]], or that certain variables not appear in the subformula or term{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}.

==Finite axiomatization==
Given that the number of possible subformulas or terms that can be inserted in place of a schematic variable is [[countably infinite]], an axiom schema stands for a countably infinite set of axioms. This set can usually be [[recursive definition|defined recursively]]. A theory that can be axiomatized without schemata is said to be ''finitely axiomatized''. Theories that can be finitely axiomatized are seen as a bit more metamathematically elegant, even if they are less practical for deductive work.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Examples==
Two very well known instances of axiom schemata are the:
* [[mathematical induction|induction]] schema that is part of [[Peano's axioms]] for the arithmetic of the [[natural number]]s;
* [[axiom schema of replacement]] that is part of the standard [[ZFC]] axiomatization of [[set theory]].
[[Czesław Ryll-Nardzewski]] proved that Peano arithmetic cannot be finitely axiomatized and [[Richard Montague]] proved that ZFC cannot be finitely axiomatized.&lt;ref&gt;Czesław Ryll-Nardzewski 1952; Richard Montague 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the axiom schemata cannot be eliminated from these theories. This is also the case for quite a few other axiomatic theories in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, etc.

==Finitely axiomatized theories==
All theorems of [[ZFC]] are also theorems of [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], but the latter can be finitely axiomatized. The set theory [[New Foundations]] can be finitely axiomatized, but only with some loss of elegance.

==In higher-order logic==
Schematic variables in [[first-order logic]] are usually trivially eliminable in [[second-order logic]], because a schematic variable is often a placeholder for any [[property]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] over the individuals of the theory. This is the case with the schemata of ''Induction'' and ''Replacement'' mentioned above. Higher-order logic allows quantified variables to range over all possible properties or relations.

[[File:BDN for social networking.jpg|thumb|Shows a network of cause and effect; in response to drivers, to work towards desired outcomes, enablers and capabilities support various beneficial changes.]]
A '''benefit dependency network''' (BDN) is a diagram drawn according to a specific structure that visualizes multiple cause-effect relationships organized into capabilities, changes and benefits.  It can be considered a business-oriented method of what engineers would call [[goal modeling]] and is usually read from right to left to provide a one-page overview of how a business generates value, starting with the high level drivers for change, such as found with Digital Initiatives&lt;ref&gt;Joe Peppard Harvard Business Review https://hbr.org/2016/06/a-tool-to-map-your-next-digital-initiative&lt;/ref&gt; or cross-organizational ERP management.&lt;ref&gt;Eckartz Daneva Wieringa van Hillegersberg SAC 09 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1529641&lt;/ref&gt; First proposed by Cranfield School of Management as part of a Benefits Management approach &lt;ref&gt;Benefits Management Best Practice Guidelines by John Ward, Peter Murray and Elizabeth Daniel, Cranfield School of Management, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; the original model has developed to encompass all the domains required for Benefits Management &lt;ref&gt;A look at existing methods by Torsten Langner, LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/look-existing-methods-torsten-langner&lt;/ref&gt; namely Why, What, Who and How.  Recent development has added weights to the connections to create a [[weighted graph]] so that causal analysis, sometimes referred to as [[causality]], is possible on the represented [[value chain]]s so different strategies can be compared according to value and outcome. These chains provide a way to construct a compelling story or message that shows how the benefits proposed can be realized from the changes being considered.

'''Bradley's Regress''' is a philosophical problem concerning the nature of [[Relation (philosophy)|relations]].  It is named after [[F. H. Bradley]] who discussed the problem in his 1893 book ''Appearance and Reality''.  It bears a close kinship to the issue of the [[unity of the proposition]].

== Description==

Bradley raises the problem while discussing the [[bundle theory]] of objects, according to which an [[Object (philosophy)|object]] is merely a "bundle" of [[property|properties]].  This theory raises the question of how the various properties that together comprise an object are related when they in fact comprise an object.  More generally, the question that arises is what has to be the case for any two things to be related. Bradley's Regress appears to show that the notion of two things being related generates an [[infinite regress]].  

Suppose, for example, that ''a'' respects ''b''.  This [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] seems to involve three things: ''a'', ''b'', and the relation of respecting.  For the state of affairs of ''a'' respecting ''b'' to obtain, it doesn't, however, suffice that these three things (''a'', ''b'', and the relation of respecting) exist.  They must also be related in some way.  What is required, we might say, is that ''a'' and ''b'' "stand in" the relation of respecting.  But now we seem to have another state of affairs: the state of affairs of ''a'' and ''b'' standing in the relation of respecting.  This state of affairs in turn seems to involve four things: ''a'', ''b'', the relation of respecting, and the relation of standing in.  Again, however, for it to be the case that ''a'' and ''b'' stand in the relation of respecting, it doesn't suffice that these four items exist.  They must also be related in some way.  What is required, we might now say, is that ''a'', ''b'', and the relation of respecting stand in the relation of standing in. And so on, [[ad infinitum]].

== Responses ==

In ''Appearance and Reality'', Bradley seems to conclude that the regress should lead us to abandon the idea that relations are "independently real".  One way to take this suggestion is as recommending that in the case of a respecting b, we are dealing with a state of affairs that has only two constituents: a and b.  It does not, in addition, involve a third item, "the relation of respecting", to which a and b must then bear some further relation ("standing in").

A different option is to accept that the regress is real, but to deny that it is a [[infinite regress|vicious regress]].

[[File:BetteMidler90cropped.jpg|thumb|Singer, actress and comedian [[Bette Midler]] is known for her camp stage shows and film characters.]]
'''Camp''' is an [[aesthetic]] style and sensibility that regards something as appealing because of its bad [[taste (sociology)|taste]] and [[irony|ironic]] value.&lt;ref&gt;Babuscio (1993, 20), Feil (2005, 478), Morrill (1994, 110), Shugart and Waggoner (2008, 33), and Van Leer (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  Camp aesthetics disrupt many of [[modernism]]'s notions of what art is and what can be classified as [[high art]] by inverting aesthetic attributes such as beauty, value, and taste through an invitation of a different kind of apprehension and consumption.&lt;ref name="Mallan, Kerry 2005"&gt;Mallan, Kerry, McGills, Roderick (2005) "Between a Frock and a Hard Place: Camp Aesthetics and Children's Culture", ''Canadian Review of American Studies'' Vol.35 №1 pp. 1–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Camp can also be a social practice. For many it is considered a style and performance identity for several types of entertainment including film, cabaret, and [[pantomime]].&lt;ref&gt;Mallan, Kerry, McGills, Roderick. "Between a Frock and a Hard Place: Camp Aesthetics and Children's Culture". ''Canadian Review of American Studies'' (2005) 35:1 (1)&lt;/ref&gt; Where high art necessarily incorporates beauty and value, camp necessarily needs to be lively, audacious and dynamic. "Camp aesthetics delights in impertinence." Camp opposes satisfaction and seeks to challenge.&lt;ref name="Mallan, Kerry 2005" /&gt;

Camp art is related to—and often confused with—[[kitsch]], and things with camp appeal may also be described as "cheesy". When the usage appeared in 1909, it denoted "ostentatious, exaggerated, affected, theatrical", or "[[effeminate]]" behaviour, and by the middle of the 1970s, the definition comprised "banality, mediocrity, artifice, [and] ostentation ... so extreme as to amuse or have a perversely sophisticated appeal".&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language, 1976 edition, sense 6, [Slang, orig., homosexual jargon, Americanism] banality, mediocrity, artifice, ostentation, etc. so extreme as to amuse or have a perversely sophisticated appeal&lt;/ref&gt; The American writer [[Susan Sontag]]'s essay "[[Notes on 'Camp']]" (1964) emphasized its key elements as: artifice, frivolity, naïve middle-class pretentiousness, and 'shocking' ''excess''. Camp as an aesthetic has been popular from the 1960s to the present.

Camp aesthetics were popularized by filmmakers [[George Kuchar|George]] and [[Mike Kuchar]], [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] and his film ''[[Flaming Creatures]]'', and later [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], including the last's ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'', and ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]''. Celebrities that are associated with camp personas include [[drag queen]]s and performers such as [[Dame Edna Everage]], [[Divine (performer)|Divine]], [[RuPaul]], [[Paul Lynde]], and [[Liberace]]. Camp was a part of the anti-academic defence of [[popular culture]] in the 1960s and gained popularity in the 1980s with the widespread adoption of [[postmodernism|postmodern]] views on art and culture. Television programs as varied as ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]'', and ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' have been described as camp.

== Origins and development ==
In 1909, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' gave the first print citation of ''camp'' as
{{quote|ostentatious, exaggerated, affected, theatrical; effeminate or homosexual; pertaining to, characteristic of, homosexuals. So as a noun, 'camp' behaviour, mannerisms, et cetera. (cf. quot. 1909); a man exhibiting such behaviour.}}

[[File:Carmen Miranda in The Gang's All Here trailer.jpg|thumb|[[Carmen Miranda]] in the trailer for ''[[The Gang's All Here (1943 film)|The Gang's All Here]]'' (1943)]]

According to the dictionary, this sense is "etymologically obscure". ''Camp'' in this sense has been suggested to have possibly derived from the French term ''se camper'', meaning "to pose in an exaggerated fashion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|title=camp (adj.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=camp|website=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://atilf.atilf.fr/academie9.htm Entry "camper"], in: ''[[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française]]'', ninth edition (1992). "'''2.''' Fam: Placer avec fermeté, avec insolence ou selon ses aises.] ''Il me parlait, le chapeau campé sur la tête.'' Surtout pron. ''Se camper solidement dans son fauteuil. Se camper à la meilleure place. Il se campa devant son adversaire.'' '''3.''' En parlant d'un acteur, d'un artiste: Figurer avec force et relief. ''Camper son personnage sur la scène. Camper une figure dans un tableau, des caractères dans un roman''." ('''Familiar:''' To assume a defiant, insolent or [[wiktionary:devil-may-care|devil-may-care]] attitude. '''Theatre:''' To perform with forcefulness and exaggeration; [[wiktionary:overact|to overact]].{{indent|12}}To impose one's character assertively into a scene; [[wiktionary:upstage|to upstage]].)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it evolved into a general description of the aesthetic choices and behaviour of working-class homosexual men.&lt;ref name=newton&gt;Esther Newton (1978): ''Mother Camp: Female Impersonators in America'', University Of Chicago Press. {{worldcat|name=''Mother Camp: Female Impersonators in America''|oclc=257048012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it was made mainstream, and [[adjective|adjectivized]], by [[Susan Sontag]] in a landmark essay (see below).

The rise of post-modernism made ''camp'' a common perspective on aesthetics, which was not identified with any specific group. The attitude was originally a distinctive factor in pre-[[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] [[gay]] male communities, where it was the dominant cultural pattern. It originated from the acceptance of gayness as [[effeminacy]].&lt;ref name=newton /&gt; Two key components of camp were originally feminine performances: [[Swish (slang)|swish]] and [[drag (clothing)|drag]]. With swish featuring extensive use of superlatives, and drag being exaggerated female impersonation, camp became extended to all things "over the top", including women posing as female impersonators ([[faux queen]]s), as in the exaggerated Hollywood version of [[Carmen Miranda]]. It was this version of the concept that was adopted by literary and art critics and became a part of the conceptual array of 1960s culture. Moe Meyer still defines ''camp'' as "queer parody".&lt;ref&gt;Moe Meyer (2010): ''An Archaeology of Posing: Essays on Camp, Drag, and Sexuality'', Macater Press, {{ISBN|978-0-9814924-5-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moe Meyer (2011): ''The Politics and Poetics of Camp'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-51489-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary culture ==
=== Television ===
Much of the cult following of camp today grew rapidly during the transition from black-and-white to [[colour television]] in the early 1960s. Network programming during that time sought entertainment content that would display the new medium with the use of bright colours and high stylization. The concept of the comicbook [[superhero]] (an individual in a highly stylized, outlandish and possibly impractical costume avenging otherwise serious matters such as murder) could be interpreted as camp. However, since it was aimed initially at children, it is camp only in a secondary perspective. It was not until the 1960s television version of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' (one of the more famous examples of camp in popular culture, 1966–1968) that the link was made explicit, with the inherent ridiculousness of the concept exposed as a vehicle for comedy. The villains of series as divergent as ''Batman'' and ''[[The Mod Squad]]'' (1968–1973) were costumed as to take advantage of new colours and changing fashion styles, in ways that took advantage of camp. 

Ironically, even ''Batman'' fell victim to contemporaneous parodies, with the release of ''[[Captain Nice]]'' and ''[[Mister Terrific (TV series)|Mr. Terrific]]'', which layered extra camp onto the already overladen superhero concept. The stylized content of ''Batman'' may have possibly jump-started television campiness, to circumvent the strict censorship of comics at this time (after Dr. [[Fredric Wertham]]'s essay ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' which led to the comics' industry-sponsored [[Comics Code]]), as the ''Batman'' comic books were very dark and [[Film noir|noirish]] until the 1950s and from the 1970s onwards.

Television series such as ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' (1961–1969), ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'', ''[[The Munsters]]'' (both 1964–1966), ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' (1964–1967), ''[[Lost in Space]]'' (1965–1968), ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' (1965–1969), ''[[Get Smart (TV series)|Get Smart]]'' (1965–1970), ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' (1972–1985), ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (1976–1981), ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' (1977–1984) and ''[[CHiPs]]'' (1977–1983) are enjoyed into the 21st century for what are interpreted as their "camp" aspects. Some of these series were developed 'tongue-in-cheek' by their producers.

In a ''[[Monty Python]]'' sketch of their [[Monty Python's Flying Circus|television show]] (Episode 22, "Camp Square-Bashing", repeated in their film ''[[And Now for Something Completely Different]]'', 1971), the British Army's 2nd Armoured Division has a Military "Swanning About" Precision Drill unit in which soldiers "camp it up" in unison.

TV soap operas, especially those that air in primetime, are often considered camp. The over-the-top excess of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' (1978–1991)  and ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' (1981–1989) were popular in the 1980s. The Channel 4 series ''[[Eurotrash (TV series)|Eurotrash]]'' (1993–2004) was a television programme produced using the inherent ridiculousness of its subject matter for comedic effect, often using camp dubbing in regional accents and overexaggerated stereotypical characterisations (such as an aristocratic artist based on [[Brian Sewell]]) to puncture the interviewees' pretence of seriousness. However, an obituary to [[Lolo Ferrari]] was given straight dubbing as a mark of respect at odds with its irreverence. However, the subject matter would have offended many British viewers and fallen foul of [[OFCOM]] if it was done with any seriousness. Again, this is an example of doing a programme in a camp manner to get around the likelihood of censorship. [[Mentos]] television commercials during the 1990s developed a [[cult following]] due to their camp "[[Eurotrash (term)|Eurotrash]]" humour. In the [[The Simpsons (season 8)|Season 8]] episode "[[Homer's Phobia]]" (1997) of the American [[animated comedy]] series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', gay secondary character John (played by gay director [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]) defines to [[Homer Simpson]] the meaning of the word ''camp'' to be "tragically ludicrous", or "ludicrously tragic": Homer gives a misinterpreted example of ''camp'' as "when a clown dies".

The [[Comedy Central]] television show ''[[Strangers with Candy]]'' (1999–2000), starring comedian [[Amy Sedaris]], was a camp spoof of the ''[[ABC Afterschool Special]]'' genre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-PAURpOlB8C&amp;pg=PA328&amp;dq=%22strangers+with+candy+which+was%22+camp&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGsYeZ8sHVAhVl_IMKHVcbAyAQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22strangers%20with%20candy%20which%20was%22%20camp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocregister.com/2006/07/06/strangers-with-candy-after-school-special-sedaris-style/]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ESPN Classic]] show ''[[Cheap Seats without Ron Parker]]'' (2004–2006) featured two Generation-X, real-life brothers making humorous observations while watching televised camp sporting events, which had often been featured on ''[[ABC's Wide World of Sports]]'' during the 1970s. Examples include a 1970s sport that attempted to combine [[ballet]] with skiing ([[ski ballet]]), the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] holding a televised exhibition game at the notorious [[Attica State Prison]] in upstate New York, small-time regional [[professional wrestling]] and [[roller derby]]. The television series ''[[Tim &amp; Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' (2007–2010) is a current example of camp, using inspiration from [[Public-access television]] productions, early morning [[infomercial]]s, and the use of celebrity status in [[telethon]]s and other televised charity appeals.

=== Film ===
[[File:Coca Sarli 1960s.jpg|thumb|upright|Argentine [[pop icon]] and [[sex symbol]] [[Isabel Sarli]], whose [[sexploitation film]]s made alongside [[Armando Bó]] are celebrated for their camp tone.]]
Some classic films noted for their camp tone include:
* [[John Huston]]'s ''[[Beat the Devil (1953 film)|Beat the Devil]]'' (1953, starring [[Humphrey Bogart]]), an exaggerated ''film noir'' send-up.
* Filmmaker [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] directed a number of camp films such as ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (1972), ''[[Female Trouble]]'' (1974), ''[[Desperate Living]]'' (1977), ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]'' (1981), ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'' (1988), ''[[Cry-Baby]]'' (1990), ''[[Cecil B. Demented]]'' (2000) and ''[[A Dirty Shame]]'' (2004).
* Filmmaker [[Todd Solondz]] uses camp music to illustrate the absurdity and banality of bourgeois, suburban existence. In Solondz's [[cult film]] ''[[Welcome to the Dollhouse]]'' (1995), the eleven-year-old girl protagonist kisses a boy while [[Deborah Gibson]]'s "[[Lost in Your Eyes]]" plays on a [[Fisher-Price]] tape recorder.

Films such as ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]'' (1967), ''[[Mommie Dearest (film)|Mommie Dearest]]'' (1981), ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995), and ''[[Burlesque (2010 musical film)|Burlesque]]'' (2010) gained camp status primarily due to the filmmakers' attempting to produce a serious film that wound up unintentionally comedic. Award-winning actresses, like [[Patty Duke]] in ''Valley of the Dolls'' and [[Faye Dunaway]] in ''Mommie Dearest'', gave such over-the-top performances that the films became camp classics, especially attracting fanfare from gay, male audiences.

The second part of the 1978 movie ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' set in fictional Metropolis takes on a campy [[Screwball comedy film|screwball]] tone after the seriousness of the origin story.

Educational and industrial films form an entire subgenre of camp films, with the most famous being the much-spoofed 1950s ''[[Duck and Cover (film)|Duck and Cover]]'' film, in which an anthropomorphic, cartoon turtle explains how one can survive a nuclear attack by hiding under a school desk. Its British counterpart ''[[Protect and Survive]]'' could be seen as [[kitsch]], even though it is very chilling to watch (it was never shown on grounds of [[national security]] and would only be broadcast if an attack was deemed likely within 72 hours). Many British [[Public Information Film]]s gained a camp cult following, such as the famous [[Charley Says]] series. Charley's voice is performed by the camp surrealist comedian and Radio DJ [[Kenny Everett]], who came from an [[advertising]] background as a [[copywriter]].

Some films are intentionally and consciously camp, such as ''[[The Toxic Avenger (film)|The Toxic Avenger]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'' (1994). [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s black comedy crime film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994) has also fallen into this category, with film critic [[Nicholas Christopher]] calling it "more gangland Camp than neo-noir". In [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British cinema]] the archetypal camp film cult is the outrageous long-running, 30-film [[Carry On (film series)|''Carry On'' series]] (1958–1978). Another cult is built around ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975). ''[[Preaching to the Perverted (film)|Preaching to the Perverted]]'' (1997), written and directed by [[Stuart Urban]], broke out of traditional British comedy style to portray the fetish and [[BDSM]] scene under assault from Christian crusaders and the authorities. It portrayed both the fetish scene and the Establishment in a cartoon, stylized visual manner. Lambasted by most traditional critics, lauded by gay, music and fashion press, it went on to build a lasting cult reputation.

Movie versions of camp TV shows in recent years have made the camp nature of these shows a running gag throughout the films. In ''[[Grizzly Man]]'' (2005), a documentary by Werner Herzog, the protagonist, Timothy Treadwell, describes the wild life of bears with camp mannerisms. Inspired by the work of [[George Kuchar]] and his brother [[Mike Kuchar]], [[ASS Studios]], launched in 2011 by Courtney Fathom Sell and [[Jen Miller]], began making a series of short, no-budget camp films. Their feature film ''[[Satan, Hold My Hand]]'' (2013) features many elements recognized in camp pictures.&lt;ref&gt;filmmakermagazine.com/27295-courtney-fathom-sells-hi-8-hi...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/29016-so-you-wanna-be-an-underground-filmmaker/|title=COURTNEY FATHOM SELL: SO YOU WANNA BE AN UNDERGROUND FILMMAKER?|work=Filmmaker Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retro-camp fashion is an example of modern [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]] employing camp styles for the sake of humour. Yard decorations, popular in some parts of suburban and rural America, are examples of kitsch and are sometimes displayed as camp expressions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The classic camp yard ornament is the pink [[plastic flamingo]]. The [[yard globe]], [[garden gnome]], wooden cut-out of a fat lady bending over, the statue of a small black man holding a lantern (called a [[lawn jockey]]) and ceramic statues of [[white-tailed deer]] are also prevalent camp lawn decorations.

The [[Carvel (restaurant)|Carvel]] chain of soft-serve ice cream stores is famous for its camp style, camp low-budget TV commercials and camp ice-cream cakes such as [[Cookie Puss]] and [[Fudgie The Whale]].

== Distinguishing between kitsch and camp ==
The words "camp" and "[[kitsch]]" are often used interchangeably; both may relate to art, literature, music, or any object that carries an aesthetic value. However, "kitsch" refers specifically to the work itself, whereas "camp" is a mode of performance. Thus, a person may consume kitsch intentionally or unintentionally. Camp, as Susan Sontag observed, is always a way of consuming or performing culture "in quotation marks."&lt;ref name="Sontag2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Sontag|title=Against Interpretation and Other Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HLdQPwAACAAJ|accessdate=6 September 2011|date=2 July 2009|publisher=Penguin Modern Classics|isbn=978-0-14-119006-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Sontag also distinguishes the difference between "naive" and "deliberate" camp. Kitsch, as a form or style, certainly falls under the category "naive camp" as it is unaware that it is tasteless; "deliberate camp", on the other hand, can be seen as a subversive form of kitsch which deliberately exploits the whole notions of what it is to be kitsch. (Sontag, 1964)

== Around the world ==
[[File:Mika Glastonbury.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Pop singer [[Mika (singer)|Mika]] is known for his camp-styled performances]]

Thomas Hine identified 1954–1964 as the campiest period in modern US history. During this time, Americans had more money to spend, thanks to the post-war economic boom; but they often exercised poor taste. In the UK, on the other hand, camp is an adjective, often associated with a stereotypical view of [[Femininity|feminine]] gay men. The term has been in common use for many decades. Gay comedian [[Kenneth Williams]] wrote in a diary entry for 1 January 1947: "Went to Singapore with Stan—very camp evening, was followed, but tatty types so didn't bother to make overtures."&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell Davies]] (1993) ''The Kenneth Williams Diaries'', Harper-Collins Publishers {{ISBN|978-0-00-255023-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it applies to gay men, it is a specific adjective used to describe a man that openly promotes the fact that he is gay by being outwardly garish or eccentric, for example, the character [[Daffyd Thomas]] in the English comedy skit show ''[[Little Britain]]''. "Camp" forms a strong element in UK culture, and many so-called gay-icons and objects are chosen as such because they are camp. People like [[Kylie Minogue]], [[John Inman]], [[Lawrence Llewelyn Bowen]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Graham Norton]], [[Mika (singer)|Mika]], [[Lesley Joseph]], [[Ruby Wax]], [[Dale Winton]], [[Cilla Black]], and the [[music hall]] tradition of the [[pantomime]] are camp elements in popular culture.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The British tradition of the "[[Last Night of the Proms]]" has been said to glory in nostalgia, camp, and pastiche.&lt;ref&gt;Compare:

The Australian theatre and opera director [[Barrie Kosky]] is renowned for his use of camp in interpreting the works of the [[Western canon]] including [[Shakespeare]], [[Wagner]], [[Molière]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Kafka]] and his 2006 eight-hour production for the Sydney Theatre Company ''The Lost Echo'', based on [[Ovid]]'s ''Metamorphoses'' and [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Bacchae]]''. In the first act ("The Song of Phaeton"), for instance, the goddess Juno takes the form of a highly stylized [[Marlene Dietrich]], and the musical arrangements feature [[Noël Coward]] and [[Cole Porter]]. Kosky's use of camp is also effectively employed to satirize the pretensions, manners, and cultural vacuity of Australia's suburban [[middle class]], which is suggestive of the style of [[Dame Edna Everage]]. For example, in ''The Lost Echo'' Kosky employs a chorus of [[Secondary school|high school]] girls and boys: one girl in the chorus takes leave from the goddess Diana, and begins to rehearse a dance routine, muttering to herself in a broad Australian accent, "Mum says I have to practise if I want to be on ''[[Australian Idol]]''." See also the works of Australian writer/director Baz Luhrmann, in particular "Strictly Ballroom".

Since 2000, the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], an annually televised competition of song performers from different countries, has shown an increased element of camp—since the contest has shown an increasing attraction within the gay communities—in their stage performances, especially during the televised finale, which is screened live across Europe. As it is a visual show, many [[Eurovision]] performances attempt to attract the attention of the voters through means other than the music, which sometimes leads to bizarre onstage gimmicks, and what some critics have called "the Eurovision kitsch drive", with almost cartoonish novelty acts performing.

== Literature ==
The first post-World War II use of the word in print, marginally mentioned in the Sontag essay, may be [[Christopher Isherwood]]'s 1954 novel ''The World in the Evening'', where he comments: "You can't camp about something you don't take seriously. You're not making fun of it; you're making fun ''out'' of it. You're expressing what's basically serious to you in terms of fun and artifice and elegance."  In the American writer [[Susan Sontag]]'s 1964 essay "[[Notes on "Camp"|Notes on 'Camp']]", Sontag emphasized artifice, frivolity, naïve middle-class pretentiousness, and shocking excess as key elements of camp. Examples cited by Sontag included [[Tiffany lamp]]s, the drawings of [[Aubrey Beardsley]], Tchaikovsky's ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'', and Japanese science fiction films such as [[Rodan (film)|''Rodan'']], and ''[[The Mysterians]]'' of the 1950s.

In Mark Booth's 1983 book ''Camp'' he defines camp as "to present oneself as being committed to the marginal with a commitment greater than the marginal merits." He carefully discerns the distinction between genuine camp, and ''camp fads and fancies'', things that are not intrinsically camp, but display artificiality, stylization, theatricality, naivety, sexual ambiguity, tackiness, poor taste, stylishness, or portray camp people, and thus appeal to them. He considers Sontag's definition problematical because it lacks this distinction.

==Analysis==
As a cultural challenge, camp can also receive a political meaning, when minorities appropriate and ridicule the images of the dominant group, the kind of activism associated with [[multiculturalism]] and the [[New Left]]. The best known instance of this is the [[gay liberation]] movement, which used camp to confront society with its own preconceptions and their historicity.  The first positive portrayal of a gay secret agent in fiction appears in a series, ''[[The Man from C.A.M.P.]]'' in which the protagonist is, paradoxically, effeminate yet physically tough. Female camp actresses such as [[Mae West]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Greta Garbo]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], and [[Joan Crawford]] also had an important influence on the development of feminist consciousness: by exaggerating certain stereotyped features of femininity, such as fragility, open emotionality or moodiness, they attempted to undermine the credibility of those preconceptions. The multiculturalist stance in cultural studies therefore presents camp as political and critical.

As a part of its adoption by the mainstream, camp has undergone a softening of its original subversive tone, and is often little more than the recognition that popular culture can also be enjoyed by a sophisticated sensibility.  Mainstream [[comic books]] and B [[Western (genre)|Western]]s, for example, have become standard subjects for academic analysis. The normalisation of the outrageous, common to many [[avant-garde|Vanguardist]] movements—has led some critics to argue the notion has lost its usefulness for critical art discourse.

According to the sociologist [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]], camp engages in a redefinition of cultural meaning through a juxtaposition of an outmoded past alongside that which is technologically, stylistically, and sartorially contemporary. Often characterized by the reappropriation of a "throwaway Pop aesthetic", camp works to intermingle the categories of "high" and "low" culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects may become camp objects because of their historical association with a power now in decline. As opposed to kitsch, camp reappropriates culture in an ironic fashion, whereas kitsch is indelibly sincere. Additionally, kitsch may be seen as a quality of an object, while camp, "tends to refer to a subjective process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who identify objects as “camp” commemorate the distance mirrored in the process through which, "unexpected value can be located in some obscure or exorbitant object."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of camp's irony is problematic, insofar as the agents of cultural redefinition are often of upper- or middle-class standing who could, "afford, literally, to redefine the life of consumerism and material affluence as a life of spiritual poverty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camp-style performances may allow certain prejudices to be perpetuated by thinly veiling them as irony. Some feminist critics argue that drag queens are misogynistic because they make women seem ridiculous and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. This criticism posits that drag queens are the gay equivalent of the black and white minstrel. Some critics claim that camp comedians like Larry Grayson, Kenny Everett, Duncan Norvelle and Julian Clary perpetuate gay stereotypes and pander to homophobia. This sign of a privileged cultural position left the lower-class standing incapable of any cultural redefinition, thereby relegating them to a static position which could then only be lifted by those with enough capital.

Camp aesthetics became the curious site of personal liberation from the stranglehold of the corporate, capitalist state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the capitalist environment of constant consumption, camp rediscovers history's waste, bringing back objects thought of as refuse or of bad taste. Camp liberates objects from the landfills of history and reinvokes them with a new charisma. In doing so camp creates an economy separate from that of the state. In Ross's words, camp, "is the re-creation of surplus value from forgotten forms of labor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This is perhaps why camp often faces criticism from other political and aesthetic perspectives. For example, the most obvious argument is that camp is just an excuse for poor quality work and allows the tacky and vulgar to be recognized as valid art. In doing so, camp celebrates the trivial and superficial and form over content. This could be called the "yuck factor". The power of the camp object may be found in its ability to induce this reaction. In a sense objects that fill their beholders with disgust fulfill Sontag's definition of the ultimate camp statement, "it's good because it's awful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From flea markets to thrift stores, the 'bad taste' of camp has been increasingly reinculcated with the cultural capital that it had intended to break away from. In an attempt to "present a challenge to the mechanisms of control and containment that operate in the name of good taste", the camp aesthetic has fallen flat on its face and has been appropriated by artists such as [[Macklemore]] with his hit single "[[Thrift Shop]]".&lt;ref name="Ross 1989 153"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, his fame is only enjoyed at the expense of others, as Ross writes, "it [the pleasure of camp] is the result of the (hard) work of a producer of taste and 'taste' is only possible through exclusion and depreciation."&lt;ref name="Ross 1989 153" /&gt;

The '''Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education''' is a framework for classifying colleges and universities in the [[United States]]. The framework primarily serves educational and research purposes, where it is often important to identify groups of roughly comparable institutions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/|title=About Carnegie Classification|last=|first=|date=n.d.|website=The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|publisher=Indiana University Center for Postsecondary Research|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classification includes all [[School accreditation|accredited]], [[academic degree|degree]]-granting colleges and universities in the United States that are represented in the National Center for Education Statistics [[Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System]] (IPEDS).

The Carnegie Classification was created by the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie Commission on Higher Education]] in 1970. The classification was first published in 1973 with updates in 1976, 1987, 1994, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To ensure continuity of the classification framework and to allow comparison across years, the 2015 Classification update retains the same structure of six parallel classifications, initially adopted in 2005.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The 2005 report substantially reworked the classification system, based on data from the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 school years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Basic Classification Technical Details | publisher = Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching | year=  2005 | url = http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=805 | accessdate = 24 September 2008 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 2014, the Carnegie Foundation transferred responsibility for the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education to the Center for Postsecondary Research of the [[Indiana University School of Education]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], [[Indiana]]. The classification retained the Carnegie name after the Center for Postsecondary Research took over on January 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.carnegiefoundation.org/newsroom/news-releases/iu-research-center-house-carnegie-classification-institutions-higher-education|title=IU research Center to House Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|last=|first=|date=2014-10-08|work=Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|access-date=2017-06-02|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctorate-granting Universities===
''Doctorate-granting Universities'' are institutions that awarded at least 20 research/scholarly doctorates in 2013–14. Professional doctorates (M.D., J.D., etc.) are not included in this count. The framework further classifies these universities by their level of research activity, as measured by research expenditures, number of research doctorates awarded, number of research-focused faculty, and other factors.&lt;ref name=BasicTechnical&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005).

===Special Focus Institutions===
''Special Focus Institutions'' were classified "based on the concentration of degrees in a single field or set of related fields, at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Institutions were determined to have a special focus with concentrations of at least 80 percent of undergraduate and graduate degrees. In some cases this percentage criterion was relaxed if an institution identified a special focus on the [[College Board]]'s Annual Survey of Colleges, or if an institution's only accreditation was from a body related to the special focus categories".&lt;ref name=BasicTechnical /&gt;

===Not classified===
The Basic Classification omits 26 institutions.

==Undergraduate Instructional Program==
The ''Undergraduate Instructional Program'' classification combines (a) the ratio of Arts and sciences and professional fields (as defined in the [http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2002165 Classification of Instructional Programs] (CIP)) and (b) the coexistence of programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels (again using the CIP).&lt;ref name=UIPTechnical&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=793 Technical Details &gt; Undergraduate Instructional Program].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts and sciences and professional fields===
The framework categorizes institutions based on the proportion of undergraduate majors in arts and sciences or professional fields, based on their two-digit CIP.&lt;ref name=UIPTechnical /&gt;

* ''Associates Only (Assoc)'' only award associate degrees.
* ''Associates Dominant (Assoc-Dom)'' award some bachelor's degrees, but award more associates's degrees.
* ''Arts &amp; Sciences Focus (A&amp;S-F)'' award least 80 percent of undergraduate degrees in the arts and sciences.
* ''Arts &amp; Sciences + Professions (A&amp;S+Prof)'' award between 80 and 59 percent of undergraduate degrees in the arts and sciences.
* ''Balanced Arts &amp; Sciences/Professions (Bal)'' award 41 to 59 percent of undergraduate degrees in each domain.
* ''Professions + Arts &amp; Sciences (Prof+A&amp;S)'' award between 80 and 59 percent of undergraduate degrees in a professional field.
* ''Professions Focus (Prof-F)'' award at least 80 percent of undergraduate degrees in a professional field.

===Graduate coexistence===
The framework categorizes institutions based on the proportion of undergraduate and graduate programs (defined by their 4-digit CIP) that coexist.&lt;ref name=UIPTechnical /&gt;

* ''No coexistence (NGC)''—no programs coexist.
* ''Some coexistence (SGC)''—some graduate programs coexist with undergraduate programs but fewer than half.
* ''High coexistence (HGC)''—at least half of the graduate programs coexist with undergraduate programs.

==Graduate instructional program==
The ''Graduate Instructional Program'' classification indicates (a) if the institution awards just master's degrees or master's degrees and doctoral degrees, and (b) in what general categories they  predominantly award graduate degrees. Institutions that do not award graduate degrees are not classified by this scheme.&lt;ref name=GIPTechnical&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=794 "Technical Details &gt; Graduate Instructional Program"].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postbaccalaureate graduate programs===
Institutions that offer graduate and professional programs (such as law schools) but do not award the doctorate are classified as having ''Postbaccalaureate'' graduate programs.&lt;ref name=GIPTechnical /&gt; These programs are classified by the fields in which the degrees are awarded.

*Single postbaccalaureate (education) (S-PostBac/Ed)''—only offer graduate training in education.
*''Single postbaccalaureate (business) (S-PostBac/Bus)''—only offer graduate training in business.
*''Single postbaccalaureate (other field) (S-PostBac/Other)''—only offer graduate training in a field other than education or business.
*''Postbaccalaureate comprehensive (PostBac-Comp)''—offer graduate training in the humanities, social sciences, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Medicine (STEM), and one or more professional fields.
*''Postbaccalaureate, arts &amp; sciences dominant (PostBac-A&amp;S)''—only offer graduate training in the arts and sciences.

*''Doctoral, [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] dominant (Doc/STEM)'' award most of their doctorates in STEM fields.
*''Doctoral, professional dominant (Doc/Prof)'' award most of their doctorates are awarded in professional fields other than engineering.

==Enrollment profile==
The Enrollment Profile of institutions are classified according to (a) the level of the highest degree awarded and (b) the ratio of undergraduate to graduate students.&lt;ref name=EPTechnical&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=795 Technical Details &gt; Enrollment Profile Program].&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Exclusively undergraduate two-year (ExU2)''—students are not awarded bachelor's or higher degrees.
*''Exclusively undergraduate four-year (ExU4)''—students are only awarded bachelor's degrees.
*''Very high undergraduate (VHU)''—fewer than 10 percent of students are graduate students.
*''High undergraduate (HU)''—more than 10 percent, but fewer than 25 percent of students are graduate students.
*''Majority undergraduate (MU)''—more than 24 percent, but fewer than 50 percent of students are graduate students.
*''Majority graduate/professional (MGP)''—fewer than 50 percent of students are undergraduates.
*''Exclusively graduate/professional (ExGP)—''students are only awarded degrees higher than bachelor's.

==Undergraduate profile==
The framework classifies institutions' ''Undergraduate Profile'' according to (a) the proportion of part-time undergraduate students to full-time students, (b) the institutions selectivity in admitting undergraduate students, and (c) the percentage of students who transfer into the university.&lt;ref name=UPTechnical&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=796 Technical Details &gt; Undergraduate Profile].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enrollment status===
The framework classifies ''Enrollment Status'' according to the ratio of part-time to full-time students (degree seeking students in four-year institutions).&lt;ref name=UPFlowchart&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/dynamic/downloads/file_1_338.pdf Undergraduate Profile] classification flow chart.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''PT2'': Higher part-time two-year—more than 60 percent of students at this 2-year institution are part-time.
*''Mix2'': Mixed part/full-time two-year—between 39 and 60 percent of students at this 2-year institution are part-time.
*''MFT2'': Medium full-time two-year—more than 60 but fewer than 91 percent of students at this 2-year institution are full-time.
*''FT2'': Higher full-time two-year—more than 90 percent of students at this 2-year institution are full-time.
*''PT4'': Higher part-time four-year—more than 39 percent of students at this 4-year or higher institution are part-time.
*''MFT4'': Medium full-time four-year—more than 60 percent but fewer than 80 percent of students at this 4-year or higher institution are full-time.
*''FT4'': Full-time four-year—more than 79 percent of students at this 4-year or higher institution are full-time.

===Achievement characteristics/selectivity===
''Selectivity'' is classified according to the [[SAT]] and [[ACT (examination)|ACT]] scores of first-time first-year students. This classification only applies to four-year or higher institutions.  As of the 2010 edition the criteria were as follows (http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/methodology/ugrad_profile.php)&lt;ref name=UPTechnical /&gt;
*''Inclusive (I)''—students had a 25th percentile ACT-equivalent score below 18.
*''Selective (S)''—students had a 25th percentile ACT-equivalent score from 18 to 21.
*''More Selective (MS)''—students had a 25th percentile ACT-equivalent score greater than 21.

===Transfer origin===
''Transfer origin'' characterizes the percentage of students who transfer to the institution, and only applies to four-year or higher institutions.&lt;ref name=UPTechnical /&gt;
*''Lower transfer-in (LTI)''—fewer than 20 percent of students transfer into the institution.
*''Higher transfer-in (HTI)''—more than 19 percent of students transfer into the institution.

==Size and setting==
''Size and Setting'' classifies institutions according to (a) size of their student body and (b) percentage of student who reside on campus. This does not apply to exclusively graduate and professional institutions and special-focus institutions.&lt;ref name=SSTechnical&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=797 Technical Details &gt; Size &amp; Setting].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size===
The ''size'' of institutions is based on their ''full-time equivalent (FTE)'' enrollment. FTEs are calculated by adding the number of full-time students to one-third the number of part-time students.  Two-year colleges are classified using a different scale than four-year and higher institutions.&lt;ref name=SSTechnical /&gt;

*''Very small two-year (VS2)''—fewer than 500 FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*''Small two-year (S2)''—at least 500 but fewer than 2000 FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*''Medium two-year (M2)''—at least 2000 but fewer than 5000 FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*''Large two-year (L2)''—at least 5000 but fewer than 10000 FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*''Very large two-year (VL2)''—10000 or more FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*''Very small four-year (VS4)''—fewer than 1000 FTEs attend this four-year institution.
*''Small four-year (S4)''—at least 1000 but fewer than 3000 FTEs attend this four-year institution.
*''Medium four-year (M4)''—at least 3000 but fewer than 10000 FTEs attend this four-year institution.
*''Large four-year (L4)''—more than 10000 FTEs attend this four-year institution.

===Setting===
''Setting'' is based on the percentage of full-time undergraduates who live in institutionally-managed housing.&lt;ref name=SSTechnical /&gt; Two-year institutions are not classified by setting.&lt;ref name=SSFlowchart&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/dynamic/downloads/file_1_373.pdf Size and Setting] classification flow chart.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Primarily nonresidential (NR)''—fewer than 25 percent of degree-seeking undergraduates or fewer than 50 percent enrolled full-time live on campus.&lt;ref name=SSTechnical /&gt;
*''Primarily residential (R): (a)''—at least 25 percent of degree-seeking undergraduates live on campus and (b) at least 50 percent but fewer than 80 percent attend full-time.
*''Highly residential (HR)''—at least half of degree-seeking undergraduates live on campus and at least 80 percent attend full-time.&lt;ref name=SSTechnical /&gt;

==2005 edition==
In contrast to previous classifications, the 2005 classification scheme provides a "...set of multiple, parallel classifications."&lt;ref name=MainWebsite&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/ The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822000000/http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/ |date=22 August 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alexander C. McCormick, Senior Scholar at The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and director of the classifications project, "The five new classifications are organized around three central questions: 1) What is taught, 2) to whom, and 3) in what setting?"&lt;ref name=McCormickPerspective&gt;McCormick, Alexander C. (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/perspectives/sub.asp?key=245&amp;subkey=882 A New Set of Lenses for Looking at Colleges and Universities], [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/perspectives/index.asp?key=532 Carnegie Perspectives], November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the new classification categories, the previously used classification scheme ("Basic classification") has been revised.

The Carnegie Foundation is also developing one or more voluntary classification schemes that rely on data submitted by institutions.&lt;ref name=MainWebsite /&gt; The first focuses on outreach and community engagement, and the second on "...how institutions seek to analyze, understand, and improve undergraduate education."&lt;ref name=McCormickPerspective /&gt;

The Carnegie Foundation has no plans to issue printed editions of the classifications. Their [https://web.archive.org/web/20080822012422/http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/ website] has several tools that let researchers and administrators view classifications.&lt;ref name=PrintFAQ&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/about/sub.asp?key=18&amp;subkey=405#13 Carnegie Classification FAQs: Will the classifications be available in print?].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revisions in the basic classification===
The "basic classification" is an update of the original classification scheme. In addition to changing names of some categories, the 2005 revision differs from previous editions in that it:&lt;ref name=BasicTechnical /&gt;

# Splits Associates colleges into subcategories. This is based on the work of Stephen Katsinas, Vincent Lacey, and David Hardy at the [[University of Alabama]] and is an update of work funded in the 1990s by the [[Ford Foundation]].
# Categorizes doctorate-granting institutions according to their level of research activity. This level is calculated using multiple measures, financial and otherwise.
# Simplifies the measurement of doctorate degrees awarded.
# Divides Master's colleges and universities into three categories based on the number of [[Master's degrees]] awarded.
# Deprecates "[[Liberal Arts]]" terminology.{{Request quotation|date=May 2014}}
# Modified the criteria separating Master's and Baccalaureate institutions. Institutions formerly classified as Master's Colleges and Universities are now classified as Baccalaureate Colleges.
# Requires institutions to have higher levels of single-field or related-field concentration for designation as special-focus institutions and utilizes more sources of information to identify special-focus institutions.
# Splits the "Schools of engineering and technology" category into two categories and eliminates the "Teacher's colleges" category.
# Measures and classifies service academies using to the same criteria as other institutions.

==Previous editions==
Prior to the 2000 edition, the Carnegie Foundation categorized doctorate-granting institutions according to the amount of [[Federal Government of the United States|federal]] funding they received.  The 2005 edition categorizes doctoral-institutions according to their research support but uses a more complex formula than used in previous editions.  Despite the fact that it is no longer used by the Carnegie Foundation, the descriptor ''[[Research I university|Research&amp;nbsp;I]]'' is still commonly used in reference to universities with the largest research budgets, often by the institutions themselves in their promotional materials.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The study of the '''causes of transsexuality''' investigates [[Gender identity#Factors influencing formation|gender identity formation]] of [[transgender]] people, especially those who are [[transsexual]]. Transsexual people have a gender identity that does not match their [[assigned sex]], often resulting in [[gender dysphoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transgender experiences – Information and support|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_097168.pdf|publisher=NHS|accessdate=2012-07-01|author=Curtis, R.|pages=12|format=PDF|date=March 2009|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--this is used to transclude content into [[Transsexual]], [[Transgender]] and potentially other articles--&gt;&lt;section begin="factors" /&gt; The causes of transsexuality have been studied for decades.  The most studied factors are biological. Certain brain structures in trans women have been found to be similar to [[cisgender]] women's as opposed to cis men's, and trans men's have been found to be similar to cis men's, even controlling for [[Hormone therapy|hormone use]], which can also cause trans people's brains to become closer to those of cis people of the same gender. However, these studies are limited as they include a small number of tested individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4158/EP14351.RA |pmid=25667367 |title=Evidence Supporting the Biologic Nature of Gender Identity |journal=Endocrine Practice |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=199–204 |year=2015 |last1=Saraswat |first1=Aruna |last2=Weinand |first2=Jamie |last3=Safer |first3=Joshua }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brain structure differences have also been noted between [[gay]] and [[heterosexual]] men, as well as [[lesbian]] and heterosexual women as part of extensive research on [[biology and sexual orientation]]. Studies have also found that both [[androphilic and gynephilic]] trans women's brain function and responses are like cis women's and unlike cis men's, or are intermediate between the two. Likewise, studies such as Rametti's have found that trans men have male-like white matter patterns (even before using hormones), regardless of sexual orientation.

With regard to genetic factors, a study by Hare reported that trans women have a longer androgen receptor gene than cis men, which is less effective at binding testosterone, potentially preventing complete masculinization of the brain (prenatal androgen exposure or sensitivity, or lack thereof, is an often cited mechanism to explain observed brain-structure differences).&lt;ref name="Hare"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.08.033 |pmid=18962445 |pmc=3402034 |title=Androgen Receptor Repeat Length Polymorphism Associated with Male-to-Female Transsexualism |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=93–6 |year=2009 |last1=Hare |first1=Lauren |last2=Bernard |first2=Pascal |last3=Sánchez |first3=Francisco J |last4=Baird |first4=Paul N |last5=Vilain |first5=Eric |last6=Kennedy |first6=Trudy |last7=Harley |first7=Vincent R }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Bentz found that trans men have a [[CYP17]] allele distribution like cis men and unlike cis women.&lt;ref name="Bentz"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bentz |first1=E |last2=Hefler |first2=L |last3=Kaufmann |first3=U |last4=Huber |first4=J |last5=Kolbus |first5=A |last6=Tempfer|first6=C |title=A polymorphism of the CYP17 gene related to sex steroid metabolism is associated with female-to-male but not male-to-female transsexualism |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=56–9 |year=2008 |pmid=17765230 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.05.056}}&lt;/ref&gt; A twin study published in the ''International Journal of Transgenderism'' found that 33%&lt;!--[[WP:CALC]]: 13+8 / 39+25--&gt; of identical twin pairs were both trans, compared to only 2.6% of non-identical twins who were raised in the same family at the same time, but were not genetically identical.&lt;ref name="TwinH"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2010to2014/2013-transsexuality.html|title = Transsexuality Among Twins: Identity Concordance, Transition, Rearing, and Orientation|last = Diamond|first = Milton|date = May 2013|journal = International Journal of Transgenderism|doi =10.1080/15532739.2013.750222 |pmid = |access-date = 14 June 2015|volume=14|issue=1|pages=24–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental factors have also been proposed. The failure of an attempt to raise [[David Reimer]] from infancy through adolescence as a girl after his genitals were accidentally mutilated is cited as disproving the theory that gender identity is determined by upbringing. [[Ray Blanchard]] developed [[Blanchard's transsexualism typology|a taxonomy of male-to-female transsexualism]] that proposes two distinct etiologies for androphilic and gynephilic individuals that has become highly controversial, supported by [[J. Michael Bailey]], [[Anne Lawrence]], [[James Cantor]], [[Richard F. Docter]] and others, but opposed by [[Charles Allen Moser]], [[Larry Nuttbrock]], [[Julia Serano]], and the [[World Professional Association for Transgender Health]].&lt;section end="factors" /&gt;&lt;!--this is used to transclude content into [[Transsexual]], [[Transgender]] and potentially other articles--&gt;

==Biological factors==

===Genetics===
A 2008 study compared 112 male-to-female transsexuals (both androphilic and gynephilic), mostly already undergoing hormone treatment, with 258 cisgender male controls. Male-to-female transsexuals were more likely than cisgender males to have a longer version of a receptor gene (longer repetitions of the gene) for the sex hormone androgen or testosterone, which reduced its effectiveness at binding [[testosterone]].&lt;ref name="Hare"/&gt; The [[androgen receptor]] (NR3C4) is activated by the binding of [[testosterone]] or [[dihydrotestosterone]], where it plays a critical role in the forming of [[primary sexual characteristics|primary]] and [[secondary sexual characteristics|secondary]] male sex characteristics. The research suggests reduced androgen and androgen signaling contributes to the female gender identity of male-to-female transsexuals. The authors say that a decrease in testosterone levels in the brain during development might prevent complete masculinization of the brain in male-to-female transsexuals and thereby cause a more feminized brain and a female gender identity.&lt;ref name="Hare"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/10/27/2401941.htm|title=Transsexual study reveals genetic link|work=abc.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant genotype for a gene called [[CYP17A1|CYP17]], which acts on the sex hormones [[pregnenolone]] and [[progesterone]], has been found to be linked to [[female-to-male transsexual|female-to-male]] transsexuality but not MtF transsexuality.  Most notably, the FtM subjects not only had the variant genotype more frequently, but had an allele distribution equivalent to male controls, unlike the female controls. The paper concluded that the loss of a female-specific CYP17 T -34C allele distribution pattern is associated with FtM transsexuality.&lt;ref name="Bentz"/&gt;

===Transsexuality among twins===
In 2013, a [[twin study]] combined a survey of pairs of twins where one or both had undergone, or had plans and medical approval to undergo, gender transition, with a literature review of published reports of transgender twins. The study found that one third of identical twin pairs in the sample were both transgender: 13 of 39 (33%) monozygotic or identical pairs of [[assigned sex|assigned males]] and 8 of 35 (22.8%) pairs of assigned females. Among dizygotic or genetically non-identical twin pairs, there was only 1 of 38 (2.6%) pairs where both twins were trans.&lt;ref name="TwinH"/&gt; The significant percent of identical twin pairs in which both twins are trans and the virtual absence of dizygotic twins (raised in the same family at the same time) in which both were trans would provide evidence that transgender identity is significantly influenced by genetics if both sets were raised in different families.&lt;ref name="TwinH" /&gt;

===Brain structure===
Several studies have found a correlation between gender identity and brain structure.&lt;ref&gt;For a survey, see Swaab, Dick F.; Castellanos-Cruz, L.; Bao, A.-M. "The Human Brain and Gender: Sexual Differentiation of Our Brains." In: Schreiber, Gerhard. ''Transsexuality in Theology and Neuroscience. Findings, Controversies, and Perspectives.'' Berlin and Boston: Walter de Gruyter 2016 ({{ISBN|978-3-11-044080-5}}), pp. 23-42.&lt;/ref&gt; A first-of-its-kind study by Zhou ''et al.'' (1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the [[stria terminalis]] (BSTc), a region which is known for sex and [[anxiety response]]s (and which is affected by prenatal androgens),&lt;ref&gt;Neil R. Carlson, ''Psychology: The Science of Behavior'', Pearson Education, p. 418{{year missing|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; cadavers of six persons who were described as having been male-to-female transsexual or transgender persons in life had female-normal BSTc size, similar to the study's cadavers of [[cisgender]] women. While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including cadavers of non-transsexual male and female controls who, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still had sizes typical for their gender. No relationship to sexual orientation was found.&lt;ref name="Zhou/Gooren"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhou |first1=Jiang-Ning |last2=Hofman |first2=Michel A. |last3=Gooren |first3=Louis J. G. |last4=Swaab |first4=Dick F. |title=A sex difference in the human brain and its relation to transsexuality |journal=Nature |volume=378 |issue=6552 |pages=68–70 |year=1995 |pmid=7477289 |doi=10.1038/378068a0|bibcode=1995Natur.378...68Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a follow-up study, Kruijver ''et al.'' (2000) looked at the number of neurons in BSTc instead of volumes. They found the same results as Zhou ''et al.'' (1995), but with even more dramatic differences. One MtF subject, who had never gone on hormones, was also included and matched up with the female neuron counts nonetheless.&lt;ref name="Kruijver"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kruijver |first1=F. P. M. |last2=Zhou |first2=JN |last3=Pool |first3=CW |last4=Hofman |first4=MA |last5=Gooren |first5=LJ |last6=Swaab |first6=DF |title=Male-to-Female Transsexuals Have Female Neuron Numbers in a Limbic Nucleus |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=2034–41 |year=2000 |doi=10.1210/jcem.85.5.6564 |pmid=10843193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a follow-up study by Chung ''et al.'' found that significant sexual dimorphism (variation between sexes) in BSTc did not become established until adulthood.  Chung ''et al.'' theorized that either changes in fetal hormone levels produce changes in BSTc synaptic density, neuronal activity, or neurochemical content which later lead to size and neuron count changes in BSTc, or that the size of BSTc is affected by the generation of a gender identity inconsistent with one's assigned sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chung |first1=WC |last2=De Vries |first2=GJ |last3=Swaab |first3=DF |title=Sexual differentiation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in humans may extend into adulthood |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=1027–33 |year=2002 |pmid=11826131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of the evidence in 2006, Gooren confirmed the earlier research as supporting the concept of transsexuality as a sexual differentiation disorder of the sex dimorphic brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gooren |first1=L |title=The biology of human psychosexual differentiation |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=589–601 |year=2006 |pmid=16870186 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2006.06.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dick Swaab]] (2004) concurs.&lt;ref name="number11"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Swaab |first1=DF |title=Sexual differentiation of the human brain: relevance for gender identity, transsexualism and sexual orientation |journal=Gynecological Endocrinology |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=301–12 |year=2004 |pmid=15724806 |doi=10.1080/09513590400018231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a new region with properties similar to that of BSTc in regards to transsexuality was found by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab: the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou ''et al.'' (1995) and Kruijver ''et al.'' (2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MtF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FtM transsexual within the male range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garcia-Falgueras |first1=A. |last2=Swaab |first2=D. F. |title=A sex difference in the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus: relationship to gender identity |journal=Brain |volume=131 |issue=Pt 12 |pages=3132–46 |year=2008 |pmid=18980961 |doi=10.1093/brain/awn276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 [[MRI]] study by Luders et al. of 24 MtF transsexuals not yet treated with cross-sex hormones found that regional [[gray matter]] concentrations were more similar to those of cisgender men than to those of cisgender women, but there was a significantly larger volume of gray matter in the right [[putamen]] compared to cisgender men. Like earlier studies, it concluded that transsexuality was associated with a distinct cerebral pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luders |first1=Eileen |last2=Sánchez |first2=Francisco J. |last3=Gaser |first3=Christian |last4=Toga |first4=Arthur W. |last5=Narr |first5=Katherine L. |last6=Hamilton |first6=Liberty S. |last7=Vilain |first7=Eric |title=Regional gray matter variation in male-to-female transsexualism |journal=NeuroImage |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=904–7 |year=2009 |pmid=19341803 |pmc=2754583 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.03.048}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[MRI]] allows easier study of larger brain structures, but independent nuclei are not visible due to lack of contrast between different neurological tissue types, hence other studies on e.g. BSTc were done by dissecting brains post-mortem.)

An additional feature was studied in a group of FtM transsexuals who had not yet received cross-sex hormones: [[fractional anisotropy]] values for [[white matter]] in the medial and posterior parts of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), the forceps minor, and the corticospinal tract. Rametti ''et al.'' (2010) discovered that, "Compared to control females, FtM showed higher FA values in posterior part of the right SLF, the forceps minor and corticospinal tract. Compared to control males, FtM showed only lower FA values in the corticospinal tract."&lt;ref name=pmid20562024&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.05.006 |pmid=20562024 |title=White matter microstructure in female to male transsexuals before cross-sex hormonal treatment.

Hulshoff Pol ''et al.'' (2006) studied the gross brain volume of 8 male-to-female transsexuals and in 6 female-to-male transsexuals undergoing hormone treatment. They found that hormones changed the sizes of the hypothalamus in a gender consistent manner: treatment with male hormones shifted the hypothalamus towards the male direction in the same way as in male controls, and treatment with female hormones shifted the hypothalamus towards the female direction in the same way as female controls. They concluded: "The findings suggest that, throughout life, gonadal hormones remain essential for maintaining aspects of sex-specific differences in the human brain."&lt;ref name="CSCB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pol |first1=H.

Brain-based research has repeatedly shown that female-to-male transsexuals have several male-like characteristics in neuroanatomy. In 2010, a team of neuroscientists compared 18 female-to-male transsexuals with 24 male and 19 female gynephilic controls, using an MRI technique called [[diffusion tensor imaging]] or DTI.&lt;ref name=pmid20562024/&gt; DTI is a specialized technique for visualizing [[white matter]] of the brain, and white matter structure is one of the differences in neuroanatomy between men and women. The study found that the white matter pattern in female-to-male transsexuals was shifted in the direction of biological males, even before the female-to-male transsexuals started taking male hormones (which can also modify brain structure).

Similar [[Biology and sexual orientation#Studies of brain structure|brain structure differences]] have been noted between gay and heterosexual men, and between lesbian and heterosexual women.&lt;ref name="LeVay 1991"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=LeVay S |title=A difference in hypothalamic structure between heterosexual and homosexual men |journal=Science |volume=253 |issue=5023 |pages=1034–7 |date=August 1991 |pmid=1887219 |doi=10.1126/science.1887219 |bibcode=1991Sci...253.1034L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Byne 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Byne W, Tobet S, Mattiace LA |title=The interstitial nuclei of the human anterior hypothalamus: an investigation of variation with sex, sexual orientation, and HIV status |journal=Horm Behav |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=86–92 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11534967 |doi=10.1006/hbeh.2001.1680 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also found that circumstance and repeated activities such as [[Research on meditation|meditation]] modify brain structures in a process called brain plasticity or [[neuroplasticity]]. In May 2014, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported that parenting "rewires the male brain" for fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1402569111 |pmid=24912146 |pmc=4103311 |title=Father's brain is sensitive to childcare experiences |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=111 |issue=27 |pages=9792–7 |year=2014 |last1=Abraham |first1=Eyal |last2=Hendler |first2=Talma |last3=Shapira-Lichter |first3=Irit |last4=Kanat-Maymon |first4=Yaniv |last5=Zagoory-Sharon |first5=Orna |last6=Feldman |first6=Ruth |bibcode=2014PNAS..111.9792A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brain function===

====Androphilic male-to-female transsexuals====
Studies have shown that  [[androphilic]] male-to-female transsexuals show a shift towards the female direction in brain anatomy. In 2009, a German team of radiologists led by Gizewski compared 12 androphilic transsexuals with 12 cisgender males and 12 cisgender females. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), they found that when shown erotica, the cisgender men responded in several brain regions that the cisgender women did not, and that the sample of androphilic transsexuals was shifted towards the female direction in brain responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gizewski |first1 = E.

In another study, Rametti and colleagues used [[diffusion tensor imaging]] (DTI) to compare 18 androphilic male-to-female transsexuals with 19 gynephilic males and 19 androphilic cisgender females. The androphilic transsexuals differed from both control groups in multiple brain areas, including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the right anterior cingulum, the right forceps minor, and the right corticospinal tract. The study authors concluded that androphilic transsexuals were halfway between the patterns exhibited by male and female controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rametti | first1 = G. | last2 = Carrillo | first2 = B. | last3 = Gómez-Gil | first3 = E. | last4 = Junque | first4 = C. | last5 = Zubiarre-Elorza | first5 = L. | last6 = Segovia | first6 = S. | last7 = Gomez | first7 = Á. | last8 = Guillamon | first8 = A. | year = 2010 | title = The microstructure of white matter in male to female transsexuals before cross-sex hormonal treatment: A DTI study | url = | journal = Journal of Psychiatric Research | volume =  45| issue = | pages =  949–954| doi = 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gynephilic male-to-female transsexuals====
While MRI taken on [[gynephilic]] male-to-female transsexuals have likewise shown differences in the brain from non-transsexuals, no feminization of the brain's structure have however been identified.
Researchers of the [[Karolinska Institute]] of [[Stockholm]] used MRI to compare 24 gynephilic male-to-female transsexuals with 24 cisgender male and 24 cisgender female controls. None of the study participants were on hormone treatment. The researchers found sex-typical differentiation between the MtF transsexuals and cisgender males, and the cisgender females; but the gynephilic transsexuals "displayed also singular features and differed from both control groups by having reduced [[thalamus]] and [[putamen]] volumes and elevated GM volumes in the [[Insular cortex|right insular]] and [[Inferior frontal gyrus|inferior frontal cortex]] and an area covering the right [[angular gyrus]]".

These researchers concluded that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Contrary to the primary hypothesis, no sex-atypical features with signs of 'feminization' were detected in the transsexual group ... The present study does not support the dogma that [male-to-female transsexuals] have atypical sex dimorphism in the brain but confirms the previously reported sex differences. The observed differences between MtF-TR and controls raise the question as to whether gender dysphoria may be associated with changes in multiple structures and involve a network (rather than a single nodal area).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Savic | first1 = I. | last2 = Arver | first2 = S. | year = 2011 | title = Sex dimorphism of the brain in male-to-female transsexuals | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume =  21| issue = | pages =  2525–2533| doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhr032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Berglund ''et al.'' (2008) tested the response of [[gynephilia|gynephilic]] MtF transsexuals to two sex pheromones: the progestin-like 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and the estrogen-like 1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST). Despite the difference in sexual orientation, the MtFs' hypothalamic networks activated in response to the AND pheromone, like the [[androphilia|androphilic]] female control groups. Both groups experienced amygdala activation in response to EST. Gynephilic male control groups experienced hypothalamic activation in response to EST. However, the MtF subjects also experienced limited hypothalamic activation to EST. The researchers concluded that in terms of pheromone activation, MtFs occupy an intermediate position with predominantly female features.&lt;ref name=pmid18056697&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhm216 |pmid=18056697 |title=Male-to-Female Transsexuals Show Sex-Atypical Hypothalamus Activation when Smelling Odorous Steroids |journal=Cerebral Cortex |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=1900–8 |year=2007 |last1=Berglund |first1=H |last2=Lindstrom |first2=P |last3=Dhejne-Helmy |first3=C |last4=Savic |first4=I }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MtF transsexual subjects had not undergone any hormonal treatment at the time of the study, according to their own declaration beforehand, and confirmed by repeated tests of hormonal levels.&lt;ref name=pmid18056697/&gt;

====Gynephilic female-to-male transsexuals====
Another team of neuroscientists, led by Nawata in Japan, used a technique called [[single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) to compare the regional [[cerebral blood flow]] (rCBF) of 11 gynephilic FtM transsexuals with that of 9 androphilic cis females. Although the study did not include a sample of biological males so that a conclusion of "male shift" could be made, the study did reveal that the gynephilic FtM transsexuals showed significant decrease in blood flow in the left anterior cingulate cortex and a significant increase in the right [[Insular cortex|insula]], two brain regions known to respond during sexual arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.2009.02059.x |pmid=20132527 |title=Regional cerebral blood flow changes in female to male gender identity disorder |journal=Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=157–61 |year=2010 |last1=Nawata |first1=Hideyuki |last2=Ogomori |first2=Koji |last3=Tanaka |first3=Mariko |last4=Nishimura |first4=Ryoji |last5=Urashima |first5=Hajime |last6=Yano |first6=Rika |last7=Takano |first7=Koichi |last8=Kuwabara |first8=Yasuo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phantom limb syndrome====
[[Phantom limb syndrome]] is a common, often painful experience after the loss of an external organ. Ramachandran (2008) found that while nearly two thirds of non-transsexual males who have a penis surgically removed experience the sensation of a phantom penis, only one third of MtF transsexuals do so after [[male-to-female sex reassignment surgery|sex reassignment surgery]]. However, this study overlooks differences between an amputation, where nerves connecting the penis and brain are severed, and reassignment surgery, where some of the penis and scrotum may be reused to create a vaginal canal, labia and a clitoris. In this case, some nerves connecting the genitalia to the brain remain intact. Two thirds of FtM transsexuals reported the sensation of a phantom penis from childhood onwards, complete with phantom erections and other phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ramachandran |first=V. S. |title=Phantom Penises In Transsexuals |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=5–16 |year=2008 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&amp;issn=1355-8250&amp;volume=15&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=5&amp;epage=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prenatal androgen exposure===
Prenatal androgen exposure, the lack thereof, or poor sensitivity to prenatal androgens are commonly cited mechanisms to explain the above discoveries. Schneider, Pickel, and Stalla (2006) found a correlation between [[digit ratio]] (a generally accepted marker for prenatal androgen exposure) and male-to-female transsexuality. MtF transsexuals were found to have a higher digit ratio than control males, but one that was comparable to control females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schneider |first1=H |last2=Pickel |first2=J |last3=Stalla |first3=G |title=Typical female 2nd–4th finger length (2D:4D) ratios in male-to-female transsexuals—possible implications for prenatal androgen exposure |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=265–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16140461 |doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2005.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] in persons with XX sex chromosomes results in what is considered to be excess exposure to prenatal [[androgen]]s, resulting in masculinization of the genitalia and, typically, [[Intersex human rights|controversial]] prenatal hormone treatment&lt;ref name="dreger2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11673-012-9384-9 |pmid=22904609 |pmc=3416978 |title=Prenatal Dexamethasone for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia |journal=Journal of Bioethical Inquiry |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=277–294 |year=2012 |last1=Dreger |first1=Alice |last2=Feder |first2=Ellen K |last3=Tamar-Mattis |first3=Anne }}&lt;/ref&gt; and postnatal surgical interventions.&lt;ref name="clayton"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000065490 |pmid=12324718 |title=Consensus Statement on 21-Hydroxylase Deficiency from the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society |journal=Hormone Research in Paediatrics |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=188–95 |year=2002 |author1=Clayton |first1=P.

Research has shown that people with CAH and XX chromosomes will be more likely to be same sex attracted,&lt;ref name="dreger2012" /&gt; and at least 5.2% of these individuals develop serious gender dysphoria.&lt;ref name="erickson-schroth"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erickson-Schroth | first1 = Laura | year = 2013 | title = Update on the Biology of Transgender Identity | url = | journal = Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Mental Health | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 150–74 | doi = 10.1080/19359705.2013.753393 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In males with [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency]], conversion of [[testosterone]] to [[dihydrotestosterone]] is disrupted, decreasing the masculinization of genitalia. Individuals with this condition are typically raised as females due to their feminine appearance at a young age. However, more than half of males with this condition raised as females become males later in their life. Scientists speculate that the definition of masculine characteristics during puberty and the increased social status afforded to men are two possible motivations for a female-to-male transition.&lt;ref name="erickson-schroth"/&gt;

===Blanchard's theories about sexuality===

By contrast, a 2009 study found that over 90% of cis women are also attracted to the thought of themselves as women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last1=Moser |first1=Charles |title=Autogynephilia in women |year=2009 |pmid=7073469 |doi=10.1080/00918360903005212}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The theory has gained support from [[J.

The [[DSM-5]] ''Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders'' workgroup, of which Blanchard is a member, has said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In contemporary clinical practice, sexual orientation per se plays only a minor role in treatment protocols or decisions. Also, changes as to the preferred gender of sex partner occur during or after treatment (DeCuypere, Janes, &amp; Rubens, 2005; Lawrence, 2005; Schroder &amp; Carroll, 1999). It can be difficult to assess sexual orientation in individuals with a GI diagnosis, as they preoperatively might give incorrect information in order to be approved for hormonal and surgical treatment (Lawrence, 1999). Because sexual orientation subtyping is of interest to researchers in the field, it is recommended that reference to it be addressed in the text, but not as a specifier. It should also be assessed as a dimensional construct.&lt;ref name="DSM V Workgroup"&gt;from DSM5.org rationale bullet 18.

'''Criticism''' is the practice of judging the merits and faults of something. 
[[File:Julio Ruelas - Criticism - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Crítica'', engraving by [[Julio Ruelas]], ca. 1907]] 
*The judger is called a ''[[critic]]''. 
*To engage in criticism is to ''criticise'' (in British English – see [[American and British English spelling differences#aise, -ize (-isation, -ization)|American and British English spelling differences]].) 
*One specific item of criticism is called a ''criticism'' or ''[[critique]]''.

Criticism is an evaluative or corrective exercise that can occur in any area of human life. Criticism can therefore take many different forms (see below). How people go about criticizing, can vary a great deal. In specific areas of human endeavour, the form of criticism can be highly specialized and technical; it often requires professional knowledge to appreciate the criticism. For subject-specific information, see the [[Varieties of criticism]] page.

To criticize does not necessarily imply "to find fault", but the word is often taken to mean the simple expression of an object against [[prejudice]], no matter positive or negative. Often criticism involves active disagreement, but it may only mean "taking sides". Constructive criticism will often involve an exploration of the different sides of an issue. 

Criticism is often presented as something unpleasant, but there are friendly criticisms, amicably discussed, and some people find great pleasure in criticism ("keeping people sharp", "providing the critical edge"). The [[Pulitzer Prize for Criticism]] has been presented since 1970 to a newspaper writer who has demonstrated 'distinguished criticism'.

When criticism involves a [[dialogue]] of some kind, direct or indirect, it is an intrinsically social activity. &lt;!--Even if one is only criticizing a book or an idea in private, it is usually assumed there is someone who will be made aware of the criticism being expressed at some point, although who exactly will hear it, may also remain unknown. One is still engaging with the ideas of others, even if only indirectly. One can also keep a criticism to oneself, rather than express or communicate it, but in general the intention is, that someone else ought to be aware of it, however that may occur. Self-criticism, even if wholly private, still mentally takes the concerns of others into account.  &lt;&lt;   ??  --&gt;

Criticism is also the study, evaluation, and interpretation of literature, artwork, film, and social trends (see the article links below). The goal is to understand the possible meanings of cultural phenomena, and the context in which they take shape. In so doing, it is often evaluated how cultural productions relate to other cultural productions, and what their place is within a particular genre, or a particular cultural tradition.

==Etymology==
This section is about the origin and evolution of the meanings of the expression "criticism".

===Early English meaning===
*The English word criticism is derived from the French ''critique'', which dates back to at least the 14th century. 
*The words "critic" and "critical" existed in the English language from the mid-16th century, and the word "criticism" first made its appearance in English in the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Williams]], ''Keywords: a vocabulary of culture and society.'' Fontana, 1976, pp. 74–76.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In turn, the French expression ''critique'' has roots in Latin ("''criticus''" – a judger, decider, or critic), and, even earlier, classical Greek language ("''krites''" means judge, and "''kritikos''" means able to make judgements, or the critic). Related Greek terms are ''krinein'' (separating out, deciding), ''krei-'' (to sieve, discriminate, or distinguish) and ''krisis'' (literally, the judgement, the result of a trial, or a selection resulting from a choice or decision). ''[[Crito]]'' is also the name of a pupil and friend of the Greek philosopher [[Socrates]], as well as the name of an imaginary dialogue about justice written by the philosopher [[Plato]] in the context of the execution of Socrates.

The early English meaning of criticism was primarily [[literary criticism]], that of judging and interpreting literature.  [[Samuel Johnson]] is often held as the prime example of criticism in the English language, and his contemporary [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''Essay on Criticism'' is a significant landmark.  In the course of the 17th century, it acquired the more general sense of [[censure]], as well as the more specialized meaning of the "discernment of taste", i.e. the art of estimating the qualities and character of literary or artistic works, implicitly from the point of view of a consumer.

To be critical meant, positively, to have good, informed judgement about matters of culture (to be cultivated, to be a man or woman of distinction), but negatively it could also refer to the (unreasonable) rejection or (unfair) treatment of some outside group ("to be critical of them"). Derivatively, "a criticism" also referred to a nice point or a distinction, a tiny detail, a pedantic nicety, a subtlety, or a quibble (the sense of what today is called a "minor criticism"). Often criticism was governed by very strict cultural rules of politeness, propriety and decency, and there could be immediate penalties if the wrong words were said or written down (in 17th century England, more than half of men and about three-quarters of women could not read or write).

In the 19th century, criticism also gained the philosophical meaning of "a critical examination of the faculty of knowledge", particularly in the sense used by [[Immanuel Kant]]. (See [[Oxford English Dictionary]]). Such criticism was carried out mainly by academic authorities, businessmen and men of property with the leisure to devote themselves to the pursuit of knowledge.

===20th century===
In the 20th century, all these meanings continued, but criticism acquired the more general connotation of voicing an objection, or of appraising the pros and cons of something.

*The shape and meanings of criticism were influenced considerably by wars (including two world wars) occurring almost continuously somewhere in the world. 
*With the growth of specializations in the [[division of labour]], and the growth of [[tertiary education]], innumerable different branches of criticism emerged with their own rules and specialized technical meanings. 
*Philosophers such as [[Karl Popper]] and [[Imre Lakatos]] have popularized the idea that criticism is a ''normal'' part of scientific activity. Relatedly, "scientific criticism" has become a standard expression, just as much as "literary criticism". 
*Gradually it was accepted that criticism is a ''normal'' process in a democratic society, rather than a sign of inadequacy, or something that should be strictly controlled or repressed.

From the 1970s onward, under the influence of [[neo-Marxism]], [[critical theory]] and [[Michel Foucault]], it became fashionable in the English-speaking academic social sciences and humanities to use the French word "''[[critique]]''", instead of the ordinary "criticism". The suggestion is that there is a ''difference'' between the two terms, but what exactly it is, is often not altogether clear. Often the connotation is that if a deliberation is a "critique" and not just a "criticism", then there is "a lot of extra thought and profound meaning" behind what is being said. A "critique" in the modern sense is normally understood as a ''systematic'' criticism, a critical essay, or the critical appraisal of a [[discourse]] (or parts of a discourse). Thus, many academic papers came to be titled or subtitled "a critique". From the 1970s, English-speaking academics and journalists also began to use the word "critique" not only as a [[noun]], but as a [[verb]] (e.g. "I have critiqued the idea", instead of "I have criticized the idea"). What is often implied is, that "critiqueing" goes deeper into the issue, or is more complete, than "criticizing", possibly because the specialist criteria of a particular discipline are being applied.

===21st century===
*From the 1990s, the popular meanings of the word criticism have started to evolve more strongly toward "having an objection", "expressing dissent", "stating a dislike", "wanting to dissociate from something", or "rejecting something" ("If you liked it, you would not be criticizing it"). In the contemporary sense, criticism is often more the expression of an attitude, where the object of criticism may only be vaguely defined. For example, somebody "unlikes" something on [[Facebook]] or "unfriends" somebody.
*In general, there is less money in literary criticism, while it has become easier for anyone to publish anything at a very low cost on the Internet – without necessarily being vetted through critically by others.
*Professionally, "what it means to criticize" has become a much more ''specialized'' and ''technical'' matter, where "inside knowledge" is required to understand the criticism truly; this development is linked to the circumstance, that the ''right'' to criticize, or the ''propriety'' (appropriate use) of criticism, is regarded nowadays much more as depending on one's ''position'', or on the context of the situation ("I would like to say something, but I am not in a position to criticize"). 
*Because many more people are able to travel to, or have contact with, worlds completely different from their own, new problems are created of how to ''relativize'' criticisms and their limitations, how to put everything into meaningful proportion. This affects what a criticism is understood to be, or to mean, and what its overall significance is thought to be.
*Digital information technology and telecommunications have begun to change drastically the ways people have for getting attention, or for being taken seriously. In turn, this has begun to change the ways people have for ''going about'' criticizing, and what criticism ''means'' for people. 
*With more possibilities for sophisticated expression, criticism has tended to become more "layered". Beneath the observable surface presentation of criticism, which is freely advertised, there are often additional layers of deeper criticism. These are not directly accessible, because they require additional information, or insight into additional meanings. To gain access to the "whole story" about a criticism, and not just "part of the story", may be conditional on fulfilling certain entry requirements ("if you don't have the ticket, you don't get the knowledge"). 
*Together with the ability to make finer distinctions of meaning with the aid of digital equipment, the possibilities for [[ambiguity]] in criticism have increased: is a criticism being implied, or is it not, and if so, what exactly is the criticism? It can take more effort to unravel the full story.

==Classifications==
Criticism can be:
*directed toward a person or an animal; at a group, authority or organization; at a specific behaviour; or at an object of some kind (an idea, a relationship, a condition, a process, or a thing). 
*personal (delivered directly from one person to another, in a personal capacity), or impersonal (expressing the view of an organization, and not aimed at anyone personally). 
*highly specific and detailed, or very abstract and general.
*verbal (expressed in language) or non-verbal (expressed symbolically, or expressed through an action or a way of behaving).
*explicit (the criticism is clearly stated) or implicit (a criticism is implied by what is being said, but it is not stated openly).
*the result of [[critical thinking]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.hku.hk/think/critical/ |title=Module: Critical thinking |publisher=Philosophy.hku.hk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; or spontaneous impulse.

Different kinds of criticisms can be distinguished as types using the following criteria:
*'''Point of view''' from which the criticism is made ("in what framework", "from what angle or perspective" is the criticism made).
*'''Content''' of criticism, what it consists of ("what" is the criticism).
*'''Purpose''', motive, use or function of criticism ("why" is the criticism being raised, what is its aim).
*'''Form''' of criticism, language used or medium of expression (in what "style" or format is the criticism presented). 
*'''Method of delivery''', transmission or communication for the criticism ("how", or by what means, is the criticism conveyed).
*'''Type of critic''' or the source making the criticism ("from whom" criticism originates). 
*'''Target''' or object of the criticism (criticism "of whom" or criticism "of what").
*'''Context''', place, setting or situation for the criticism ("where" is the criticism being made).
*'''Recipients''' or audience of the criticism, intended or unintended (criticism directed or addressed "to where" or "to whom"). 

In dealing with criticisms, usually the most important aspects are who makes the criticism, what the criticism is about, and what or whom it is aimed at. It can also make a big difference though whether a criticism is e.g. communicated in person, or whether it is communicated with a letter or telephone message.

For an overview of criticisms from particular political or philosophical perspectives, see [[Varieties of criticism]]. For subject-specific information, see the critical pages on [[Art criticism|art]], [[Film criticism|film]], [[Literary criticism|literature]], [[Theatre criticism|theatre]], or [[Architecture criticism|architecture]].

==Psychology==
In general, the psychology of criticism studies the cognitive and emotional effects of criticism, the behavioral characteristics of criticism, and its influence on how people are reacting.

===Area of study===
The psychology of criticism is primarily concerned with: 
*the '''motivation''', purpose or intent which people have for making criticisms – healthy or unhealthy.
*the '''meaning''' of criticism for the self, and for others – positive or negative.
*the '''effect''' which criticism has on other people – good or bad.
*how people '''respond''' to criticisms, or cope with them – negatively or positively.
*the '''quantity and quality''' of criticism required to achieve the desired effect or outcome.
*the '''form''' in which criticisms are delivered – effective or ineffective.
*how people '''learn''' to give and receive criticism successfully.
*the '''[[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]''', '''[[Psychological repression|repression]]''' or '''[[denial]]''' of criticism.

Parents, teachers, lawyers, managers and politicians are often concerned with these issues, because it can make a great deal of difference to how problems are tackled and resolved.

The motivation as well as the effect of criticism may be rational, or it may be non-rational or arbitrary; it may be healthy or unhealthy.

When psychologists study criticism as a type of human behavior, they do not usually study it "in general" – such a general study is often considered to be more a ''philosophical'' concern. Psychologists usually study it in specific contexts and situations. The reason is partly technical (it is difficult to construct and prove universal generalizations about criticism as a human behavior) and partly practical (it is more useful to understand particular behaviors which are of direct practical concern).

===The most basic rule===

The most basic "rule-of-thumb" of criticism which psychologists usually recommend is:

:"'''Respect the individual, focus the criticism on the ''behavior'' that needs changing – on what people ''actually do'' or ''actually say''.'''"{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

====Rationale====
The thought behind this basic norm for criticism is: 
*If individuals are attacked for their personal characteristics (for "being who they are") it may be impossible for them to change, therefore making the criticism useless. 
*If it is not actually clear what the person ''does'', or what they are ''really saying'', the criticism may miss the mark. By concentrating clearly and only on observation of what the individual as a matter of fact ''does'' or ''says'', it is less likely, that the criticism will be misplaced, confused or misinterpreted; it is less likely, that the person being criticized is being misunderstood. It would be unfair and unjust, not to say irrelevant, to criticize people for something they have not actually done. It would be a false accusation.
*Inversely, if the individuals are respected with a bit of humor, and due credit is given to their positive intentions as human beings, it is vastly more likely that the criticism will be understood, and taken seriously. And if the criticism is clearly directed only to "what people actually do" that is wrong, instead of "who they are", it creates possibilities, options and choices for doing something different and better. They can't change who they are, but they can change their actions. Because people's sense of dignity is secure in this case, they are better able to respond to the criticism, and indeed do something about it.

The critics may just want to provoke or vent a bit of hostility, but it might backfire, because the people criticized may make a nasty response. The nasty response may "prove" to the critics, that the criticism was justified, but the critics have brought this on themselves, they have produced their own nastiness. It is easy to do, but may be difficult to live with. In the process, the whole point of the criticism may be lost – all that happens is, that there is a quarrel between people who just vent their hostility. This is very unlikely to produce any solution that all concerned can live with.

The basic psychological rule of criticism assumes that people want to use criticism to achieve an '''improvement''', usually "in good faith" ([[bona fide]]). It assumes the critic has a positive intention in making the criticism. The rule may not make much sense if there is an all-out war going on, where the opposition is just trying to destroy and discredit the target as much as possible, using almost any means they can find. Nevertheless, psychologists recommend to respond by attacking what the opponents actually ''do'', not ''who they are''. That way, the critic cannot be accused of unfair or prejudiced treatment of others.

====Application====
The basic rule is not always easy to apply.

*It may be difficult to have respect for somebody who is the target of criticism, especially if there is a history of grievances. 
*It may be that it ''seems'' as though people are being respected, but in reality (if you understand the full meaning) they are being ''disrespected''. It might look formally like they are treated as equals, but in reality (informally speaking, practically and substantively) they are being denigrated. 
*It may be difficult to consider the action which is being criticized, in its own right, ''separately'' from the person ("only you could do something awful like this to me").

Consequently, psychologists often recommend that before a criticism is being stated to a person, the critic should try to get into [[rapport]] with the person being criticized ("get in sync" with the other person, "on the same wavelength"). If that is not possible (because they are enemies), the best thing may be not to express the criticism at all, or get a mediator. It may take considerable strategy in order to find a way of making a criticism, so that it "really hits home". Rather than "shooting their mouth off", it may be wise if people say nothing, until the right time and place arrives to make the criticism.

One problem at the ''receiving'' end is that a criticism may be taken more seriously than it really merits, or that it is taken "too personally", even though that was not the intention of the critic. Criticisms are often voiced without knowing exactly what the response will be. It may be that this problem cannot be entirely removed; the best one can do is to judge, on the basis of experience, what would be the most likely effect of the criticism, and communicate the criticism as well as one can.

Another sort of problem is the limited [[attention span]] of individuals. To express a criticism may require detailed explanation or clarification; it presupposes that the knowledge exists to understand what it is about, and that people are willing to listen. That takes time, and the time may not be available, or people are reluctant to take the time. This can get in the way of the mutual respect required. It may be possible to overcome this problem only by formulating the criticism as briefly as possible, and communicate it in a form which takes the least time to understand it. Failing that, people must "make time" to discuss the criticism. It can take considerable effort to create the situation in which the criticism will be "heard".

====Exception to the rule====
The '''exception''' to the basic psychological rule consists of cases where, it is argued, the individuals and their behaviors ''cannot be distinguished''. This would be the case, for example, if the criticism itself consisted of "being there" (intruding, trespassing, causing property damage), or "not being there" (non-response).

In some cases people deliberately seek "loopholes" in the ordinary rules and channels for criticism, in order to make a criticism which, although strictly not illegal, may have a malicious intention, or offends the target of the criticism. That can cause the ordinary consideration which people have for others to be abandoned. What is legitimate and illegitimate criticism is not always easy to establish, and there may be "grey areas" in the law. It is rarely possible to make rules for every detail of what people may or may not do. The law itself can also be contested with criticism, if it is perceived as unfair. Nevertheless, the courts usually draw the line somewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Andale Gross and Tammy Webber, "Prosecutor faces new criticism over Ferguson case." ''The Seattle Times'', 26 November 2014.[http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2025102712_apxfergusonprosecutorscrutiny.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning to criticize===
The ability to criticize is something which rarely occurs naturally; it must be learnt. Good critics exhibit several kinds of qualities:
*'''Insight''': critics should clearly understand ''why'' they are criticizing.
*'''Attitude''': critics should be emotionally confident and morally comfortable, both about making a criticism, and about dealing with the response to criticism. 
*'''Inquiry''': critics should be willing to question authority, popular opinion, and assumptions.
*'''Knowledge''': critics should research the subject of their criticism to maintain the factual integrity of their criticism.
*'''Skills''': critics should choose and apply the correct kind of criticism to an issue, so that the criticism will be balanced, complete and persuasive. Critics require adequate skills in reasoning, research, and communication.
*'''Integrity''': critics should remain consistent and honest before, during, and after a criticism is expressed.

These qualities are learned through practical experience in which people have a dialogue or debate and give each other feedback. Often, teachers can design assignments specifically to stimulate students to acquire these qualities. But the facility for critical thought usually requires some personal initiative. There are plenty of "lazy critics", but one must work hard to be a good critic. The lazy critic is soon forgotten, but a good critic is remembered for years.

===Balance===

With criticism it is always important to keep things in proportion, neither overdoing things, nor being too timid.

*People can be too critical, but they can also be insufficiently critical. It is important to strike a good balance: to be neither excessively critical nor completely uncritical.
*People who are ''too critical'' and focus only on the downside or limitation of things run into the problem that others perceive them as being "too negative", and lacking a "constructive attitude". If there is too much criticism, it gets in the way of getting anything done – people are just "anti", but "it does not lead anywhere".
*People who are ''uncritical'', however, are often regarded as naive and superficial ("suckers"); they lack discernment, they are prone to being deceived and tricked, because they readily believe all kinds of things, which they should not accept just like that, for their own good. If they thought more critically, they would not give in so easily to what others say or do. The idea here is that "one should not be so open-minded that one's brains fall out."

An important reason why balanced criticism is desirable is, that if things get totally out of proportion, the critics or their targets can lose their balance themselves. Criticism can wreak havoc, and therefore people have to know how to handle it from both ends. If the criticism is balanced, it is more likely to be successful, or, at any rate, it has more credibility.

===Effect on others===
When psychologists analyze the effect of criticism on others, they are concerned with how people respond to criticism (cognitively and emotionally), and how criticism influences the recipient's behavior.

====Positive and negative effects====
When people criticize, it can have a fruitful, enriching and constructive effect on the recipient, because new ideas and viewpoints may be generated in trying to solve a problem.

People can also be hurt by criticisms, when they experience the criticism as a personal attack. Psychologists concerned with human communication, such as therapists, therefore often recommend that people should choose the right words to express their criticism.  The same criticism can be raised in different ways, some more successful than others.

====Formulation====
If people formulate their criticism in the right way, it is more likely that other people will accept it. If the criticism is badly expressed, people might reject it, not because it is wrong in itself, but because they do not like being talked to in that way. Even if the content of a criticism is quite valid, the form in which it is expressed may be so [[wikt: counterproductive|counter-productive]], that the criticism is not accepted. The ''content'' may be something that people can work out on their own, but the ''form'' concerns the social relationship between people.

====Feedback fallacy====
{{main|Feedback#Social_sciences}}
 
The term "[[feedback]]" is often used instead of criticism, because "feedback" may sound more neutral, while criticism may seem to be about "finding fault". A more polite language may be used when there are issues of [[authority]] and [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] ("who has to follow whom"), as well as the need for cooperative teamwork to get a job done ("constructive collegial attitude"). The question is often "who controls the feedback", "who is allowed to criticize", "who owns the problem" and "who is to do something about the problem". It may be that managers educate employees to employ a more positive and professional language, in order to get them to see things in a way that is [[Feedback#Social sciences|more productive]] for the enterprise.

===Quality===

Especially educators, but also e.g. lawyers, managers and politicians are very concerned with the ''quality'' of criticisms. People might raise all kinds of objections and criticisms, but how good are they? Criticisms can be just "noise". They can also be a nuisance if they are misdirected, they get in the way of getting things done.

====Good====
Ideally, a criticism should be:
*'''timely''', not too early nor too late.
*'''brief and succinct''', with a clear start and a finish, not endless.
*'''relevant and to the point''', not misplaced.
*'''clear, specific and precise''', not vague.
*'''well-researched''', not based on hear-say or speculative thought.
*'''sincere and positively intended''', not malicious.
*'''articulate, persuasive and ''[[Action item|actionable]]''''', so that the recipient can both understand the criticism and be motivated to ''act'' on the message.&lt;ref name=HackmanOldham1980&gt;J.R. Hackman and G.R. Oldham. Work Redesign. Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Pearson Education, Inc, 1980; pp. 78–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RalphKatz2013&gt;Katz, Ralph. Motivating Technical Professionals Today. ''[[IEEE Technology Management Council|IEEE Engineering Management Review]]'', Vol. 41, No. 1, March 2013, pp. 28–38&lt;/ref&gt;  

Not all criticisms have all these features, but if one or more of them is missing, the criticism is less likely to achieve its goal. Almost all guidelines for criticism mention these seven points, although in particular contexts their meaning may be more exactly specified (for example, what it means to be "articulate and persuasive" can vary according to the circumstances).

===={{Visible anchor|Lousy|Lousy criticism}}====
Logically, there are just as many ways to get a criticism wrong as to get the criticism right. 
*Criticism is made at the '''wrong time and place''': people might accept that the critic has a point, but "they can't do anything about it now."
*Criticism is '''too long''': people get confused over what it is all about, they get lost in it, and become disoriented. 
*Criticism is '''vague''': people are likely to say, "so what"?
*Criticism is '''inappropriate''', or the critic is not really in a position to make it: people will say "you're way out of line".
*Criticism has '''no clear target''': people are likely just to conclude that "so-and-so is in a bad mood right now" or "he's had too much of it."
*Criticism '''assigns blame or states problems without suggesting solutions''' ("empty criticism"): people are likely to conclude this information is not very useful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edgar H. Schein]] (with Peter S. DeLisi, Paul J. Kampas and Michael Sonduck), ''DEC is Dead, Long Live DEC – The Lasting Legacy of [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (Lessons on Innovation, Technology and the Business Gene)'', [[Berrett-Koehler Publishers]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Critic did '''no research before making the criticism''': people will say, "very interesting, but this cuts no ice."
*Criticism has '''no clear motivation''': "why are you telling me this, and why are you telling me about it now?". 
*Critic makes '''bad criticisms regularly''': it discredits the critic. 

The main effect of lousy criticism is usually that, rather than clarifying things, it becomes disorienting or confusing to people. Therefore, lousy criticism is usually regarded as unhelpful, or as an unwanted distraction getting in the way of things. The only thing a lousy criticism achieves is to make it clear that somebody has an objection (although the objection is not well-taken).

===Techniques of constructive criticism===
Techniques of constructive criticism aim to improve the behavior or the behavioral results of a person, while consciously avoiding personal attacks and blaming. This kind of criticism is carefully framed in language acceptable to the target person, often acknowledging that the critics themselves could be wrong. Insulting language and hostile language are avoided, and phrases are used like "I feel..." and "It's my understanding that..." and so on. Constructive critics try to stand in the shoes of the person  criticized, and consider what things would look like from their perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ross Bonander |url=http://www.askmen.com/money/how_to_250/275_how_to.html |title=AskMen How to: Give Constructive Criticism |publisher=Askmen.com |date=2008-10-19 |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Giving and receiving the message====

Some people are not open to any criticism at all, even constructive criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-constructive-criticism.htm |title=WiseGeek What is Constructive Criticism? |publisher=Wisegeek.com |date=2013-10-19 |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there is an art to truly constructive criticism: being well-intentioned is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for constructively criticizing, since one can have good intentions but poor delivery ("I don't know why my girlfriend keeps getting mad when I tell her to stop with the fries already; I'm just concerned about her weight"), or egocentric intentions but appropriate delivery ("I'm sick of my subordinate coming in late for work, so I took her aside and we had a long, compassionate talk about her work-life balance. I think she bought it."). As the name suggests, the consistent and central notion is that the criticism must have the aim of constructing, scaffolding, or improving a situation, something which is generally obstructed by hostile language or personal attacks.

People can sometimes be afraid to express a criticism, or afraid to be criticized. Criticism can "press all the wrong buttons." The threat of criticism can be sufficient to silence people, or cause them to stay away. So self-confidence can play a big role in criticism – the confidence to criticize, and the confidence to face criticism. If people's emotions are not properly considered, criticism can fail to succeed, even although it is well-intentioned, or perfectly sensible. Hence criticism is often considered an "art", because it involves human insight into "what one can say and cannot say" in the given situation.

====Hamburger method====

One style of constructive criticism employs the "hamburger method",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://n8tip.com/the-hamburger-method-of-constructive-criticism-works-for-vegetarians-too |title=The Hamburger Method of Constructive Criticism |publisher=N8tip.com |date=2007-09-05 |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which each potentially harsh criticism (the "meat") is surrounded by compliments (the "buns"). The idea is to help the person being criticized feel more comfortable, and assure the person that the critic's perspective is not entirely negative. This is a specific application of the more general principle that criticism should be focused on maintaining healthy relationships, and be mindful of the positive as well as the negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/articles/2001/08/23257.html |title=The 4-1-1 On Constructive Criticism |publisher=Inc.com |date=2001-08-03 |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychopathology===

The psychopathology of criticism refers to the study of unhealthy forms of criticism, and of unhealthy kinds of response to criticism. Psychologists often associate these with particular categories of mental disorders, especially personality disorders, as classified in the U.S. [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (this manual is also used in other countries, although the forms of personality disorders can be somewhat different in different countries, reflecting ethnic differences and differences in social systems).
*'''Low [[self-esteem]]''': emotionally vulnerable individuals that are often excessively sensitive to criticism, or to being defeated, they can't handle it. 
*'''[[Narcissistic personality disorder]]''': although they may not show it outwardly, criticism may "haunt" or leave them feeling [[humiliated]], degraded, hollow, and empty. They may react with disdain, [[revenge]], [[narcissistic rage]], or defiance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalhealth.com/dis/p20-pe07.html |title=Internet Mental Health |publisher=Mentalhealth.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narcissists]] are extremely sensitive to personal criticism and extremely critical of other people. They think they must be seen as [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfect]] or superior or infallible or else they are worthless. There's no middle ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.halcyon.com/jmashmun/npd/traits.html#critic |title=Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) : How to Recognize a Narcissist |publisher=Halcyon.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Paranoid personality disorder]]''': these people are often rigidly critical of others, but have great difficulty accepting criticism themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalhealth.com/dis/p20-pe01.html |title=Internet Mental Health – paranoid personality disorder |publisher=Mentalhealth.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Avoidant personality disorder]]''': these people are hypersensitive to criticism or rejection. They build up a defensive shell. If the criticism seems to imply something bad about them, a defensive shell immediately snaps into place.
*'''[[Dependent personality disorder]]''': individuals that will often apologize and "self-correct" in response to criticism at the drop of a hat.
*'''Hypercriticism''': these people are often regarded as [[anal retentive]] or nitpickers (see [[nagging]]). Nitpickers engage in minute, trivial, and unjustified faultfinding to excess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nitpicking |title=nitpicking - definition of nitpicking by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nagging means endless scolding, complaints, and faultfinding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nagging |title=nagging – definition of nagging by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Hypocriticism''': these individuals are [[hypocrites]] who criticize and accuse others about the vice that they are guilty of themselves.&lt;ref name="dictdotcom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hypocrite |title=Definition of "Hypocrite" on dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hypocrisy]] contains some kind of deception, and therefore involves a kind of lying.&lt;ref name="dictdotcom" /&gt; 

To understand pathological criticism and pathological responses to criticism, it is often not sufficient to see the individuals concerned in isolation – they should be placed in the total context in which the criticism or the response to it occurs. Particular situations can "bring out" the "bad side" of people, which in the normal run of events would not occur. Pathological criticism occurs especially in situations of intense conflict or competition, where the normal internal and external controls on people's behaviour begin to break down. Not just personal change but also a "change of scene" may be required to get rid of the disorder.

A term describing pathologic criticism may be used as [[ad hominem|argumentum ad hominem]] without proven diagnosis (see also ''anti-psychiatry movement'').

===Anti-psychiatry movement===
{{main|Anti-psychiatry|Political abuse of psychiatry}}
The anti-psychiatry movement opposes labeling persons who engage in criticism as having a "disease" (or "abuse" or "addiction"). 
*The medicalization of criticism rejects the criticism as a disease. The critics are '''silenced''', and their viewpoint is denied. They are regarded as incapable of sensible criticism, but their disease often cannot be proved – other than saying that voicing a criticism in a certain way is proof of a disease.
*''Why'' exactly a criticism is "unhealthy" can be '''difficult to prove''', nevermind its rights or wrongs – it could be subjective interpretation, a matter of personal likes and dislikes, or a matter of point of view. What is "healthy" or "unhealthy" might depend on the context, or on how it is understood. 
*People labelled as "ill" cannot be held morally '''responsible''' for their critical utterances, but people can often choose their own behaviour with regard to criticism, and they should take responsibility for their own behaviour, if they can practically do so.
*Even if it is possible to kill the criticism with a pill, the cause or the target of the criticism may '''not go away'''. A bad situation may remain; the only difference is that somebody is doped sufficiently, so that no overt criticism is made or received. 

Confronted with unhealthy criticism or unhealthy responses to criticism, it may be unwise to get scared, and it may be unnecessary to run to the doctor straightaway. It may be sufficient to talk it out, even if it is not the most pleasant discussion. If people are simply labelled "ill", they get away with behaviour{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} that, arguably, they ought to be taking responsibility for, themselves. It should not be too easily assumed that people are incapable of making conscious choices about their own behaviour, unless they are deranged (crazy), in great pain, extraordinarily confused, heavily intoxicated, or in some way trapped or locked down.

===Authority issues===
Criticism can cause harm as well as good things. Criticism can hurt or people can feel offended. It can “upset the apple cart”, cause chaos, or do real damage. For these reasons, people often try to keep the flow of criticism under control with rules.  Such rules often state:
*Who has the right to criticize, and who isn’t allowed to criticize.
*Who or what can be criticized, and who or what cannot be criticized.
*What sorts of criticism are acceptable.
*When and how the criticism may be made (the appropriate situations and formats for criticism). 
*What counts as an appropriate motivation for criticism.
These rules can be successful if people accept them, and work with them. But it can also happen that a criticism can only be made “against the rules.” In that case, a conflict can develop between the critics and the people in charge, where the authorities  try to enforce the rules, and the critics try to make their criticism regardless. The conflict could be ended in many different ways; but usually it is difficult to suppress a valid criticism altogether, permanently. A lot of critical activity may consist simply of a battle to get one’s ideas taken seriously.

==Purpose==
Here the purpose of criticism and its relative merits in particular situations are discussed.

===Negative arguments===
Criticism may not be a positive response to an individual, action, or belief in all circumstances. There are two reasons that this might be the case:

*The recipient of the critique may be hurt by it. This is particularly true when the object of criticism is personal (a political or religious belief, for example) or when the critique is composed in a malicious way, rather than in an attempt to improve the recipient.
*The critique may not result in any positive change. If the critique is not written in a persuasive manner, if the recipient of the criticism isn't willing to acknowledge their faults, or if the recipient lacks the resources needed for change, then the critique will not have an impact.

===Affirmative arguments===

However, there are also significant reasons why a critique may be necessary or desirable in particular situations.

*Diagnosis and error correction: critiques identify the limitations of the object of criticism. A film critic, for example, might discuss the extent to which a particular film was able to communicate a theme. Criticisms also identify prejudices, biases, and hidden assumptions.
*Improvement: by evaluating the ability of an individual, action, or idea to accomplish a given objective, critiques identify possible improvement areas. Criticisms may also present alternative perspectives or suggestions, both of which facilitate improvement.
*Ethical implications: critiques of societal norms or public policies have the potential to effect a large number of people in a profound way and are thus ethically desirable{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}.

Research on the dark triad is used in [[applied psychology]], especially within the fields of [[law enforcement]], [[clinical psychology]], and [[business management]]. People scoring high on these traits are more likely to commit crimes, cause social distress and create severe problems for an organization, especially if they are in leadership positions (for more information, see [[Psychopathy in the workplace|psychopathy]], [[Narcissism in the workplace|narcissism]], and [[Machiavellianism in the workplace]]).

All three dark triad traits are conceptually distinct although empirical evidence shows them to be overlapping. They are associated with a callous-manipulative interpersonal style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jones, D. N., Paulhus, D.

* [[Narcissism]] is characterized by [[grandiosity]], [[pride]], [[egotism]], and a lack of [[empathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kohut, H. |title=The Restoration of the Self |publisher=International Universities Press |location=New York |year=1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Machiavellianism]] is characterized by [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] and exploitation of others, a cynical disregard for [[morality]], and a focus on [[self-interest]] and [[deception]].&lt;ref name=Jakobwitz&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jakobwitz, S. |author2=Egan, V. |title=The 'dark triad' and normal personality traits |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=40 |pages=331–39 |year=2006 |url=https://leicester.academia.edu/VincentEgan/Papers/45043/The_dark_triad_and_personality |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.07.006 |issue=2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929002632/http://leicester.academia.edu/VincentEgan/Papers/45043/The_dark_triad_and_personality |archivedate=2012-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[factor analysis]] carried out at the [[Glasgow Caledonian University]] found that among the [[big five personality traits]], low [[agreeableness]] is the strongest correlate of the dark triad, while [[neuroticism]] and a lack of [[conscientiousness]] were associated with some of the dark triad members.&lt;ref name=Jakobwitz/&gt;

==History==
{{See also|History of narcissism|History of psychopathy}}
In 1998, McHoskey, Worzel, and Szyarto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=McHoskey J. W.|author2=Worzel W.|author3=Szyarto C.| year = 1998| title = Machiavellianism and psychopathy| url =| journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology| volume = 74| issue = 1| pages = 192–210| doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.74.1.192| pmid = 9457782 }}&lt;/ref&gt; provoked a controversy by claiming that narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy are more or less interchangeable in normal samples. [[Delroy L. Paulhus]] and McHoskey debated these perspectives at a subsequent [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) conference, inspiring a body of research that continues to grow in the published literature. Paulhus and Williams found enough behavioral, personality, and cognitive differences between the traits to suggest that they were distinct constructs; however, they concluded that further research was needed to elucidate how and why they overlap.&lt;ref name="Paulhus &amp; Williams 2002"/&gt;

==Origins==
The long-debated "[[nature versus nurture]]" issue has been applied to the dark triad. Research has begun to investigate the origins of the dark triad traits. In a similar manner to research on the [[Big Five personality traits]], empirical studies have been conducted in an effort to understand the relative contributions of biology (nature) and environmental factors (nurture) in the development of dark triad traits.

One of the ways in which researchers attempt to dissect the relative influence of genetic and environmental factors on personality (and individual differences more generally) is a broad investigative technique loosely grouped under the heading of "twin studies". For example, in one approach to twin studies,&lt;ref name="Petrides, Vernon, Schermer, Veselka 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Petrides |first1=K. V. |last2=Vernon |first2=Philip A. |last3=Schermer |first3=Julie Aitken |last4=Veselka |first4=Livia |title=Trait Emotional Intelligence and the Dark Triad Traits of Personality |journal=Twin Research and Human Genetics |date=February 2011 |volume=14 |issue=01 |pages=35–41 |doi=10.1375/twin.14.1.35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vernon, Martin, Schermer, Mackie 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vernon |first1=Philip A. |last2=Martin |first2=Rod A. |last3=Schermer |first3=Julie Aitken |last4=Mackie |first4=Ashley |title=A behavioral genetic investigation of humor styles and their correlations with the Big-5 personality dimensions |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=April 2008 |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=1116–1125 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name = "Vernon, Villani, Vickers, Harris 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vernon|first1=P.A.|last2=Villani|first2=V.C.|last3=Vickers|first3=L.C.|last4=Harris|first4=J.A.|title=A behavioral genetic investigation of the Dark Triad and the Big 5|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=2008|volume=44|issue=2|pages=445–452|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers compare the personality scores of monozygotic (MZ) or identical twins reared together to dizygotic (DZ) or fraternal twins reared together. Because both types of twins in this design are reared together, all twin pairs are regarded as having shared a 100% common environment. In contrast, the monozygotic twins share 100% of their genes whereas the dizygotic twins only share about 50% of their genes. Therefore, for any given personality trait, it is possible to parcel out genetic influences by first obtaining the MZ correlation (reflecting 100% common environment and 100% shared genes) and subtracting the DZ correlation (reflecting 100% common environment and 50% shared genes). This difference represents 50% of the genetic influence; doubled, this number is said to account for 100% of the genetic influence, and is one way to derive an index of heritability (sometimes called the heritability coefficient and represented as h&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Similarly, MZ - h&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; may be regarded as an estimate of the influence of the common environment. Finally, because individual differences and the environment are supposed to account for the totality of behavior, it is said that subtracting the sum of h&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the common environment influence from 1 is equal to the influence of unique or non-shared environments.

===Biological===
All three traits of the dark triad have been
found to have substantial genetic components.&lt;ref name="Petrides, Vernon, Schermer, Veselka 2011"/&gt; It has also been found that the observed relationships among the dark triad, and among the dark triad and the Big Five, are strongly driven by individual differences in genes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Furnham|first1=A.|last2=Richards|first2=S.C.|last3=Paulhus|first3=D.L.|title=The Dark Triad of personality: A 10 year review|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|date=2013|volume=7|issue=3|pages=199–216|doi=10.1111/spc3.12018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while psychopathy (h&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.64) and narcissism (h&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.59) both have a relatively large heritable component, Machiavellianism (h&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.31) has been found to be less heritable.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Vernon, Villani, Vickers, Harris 2008"/&gt;

===Environmental===
Compared to biological factors, the influence of environmental factors seem to be more subtle and account for less—yet still significant—variation in individual differences as related to the development of dark triad traits.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The influence of non-shared or unique environmental factors (definition and mathematical derivation included above at the end of the "Origins" subsection) accounts for a significant amount of the variance in all 3 dark triad traits (narcissism = 0.41, Machiavellianism = 0.30, psychopathy = 0.32), whereas only Machiavellianism (r = 0.39) has been found to be significantly related to a shared environmental factor.&lt;ref name="Vernon, Martin, Schermer, Mackie 2008"/&gt; Although it requires substantiation, some researchers have interpreted this latter finding (along with the comparatively lower heritability noted in the section above) to mean that Machiavellianism is the most likely dark triad trait to be influenced by experience.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Daniel N. |last2=Paulhus |first2=Delroy L. |title=The role of impulsivity in the Dark Triad of personality |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=October 2011 |volume=51 |issue=5 |pages=679–682 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.04.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the very least, this notion about the modifiability of Machiavellianism does make some sense insofar as that the less variance there is attributable to genetic factors, the more variance there must be attributable to other factors, and "other" factors have traditionally been synopsized as environmental or experiential in nature.

===Evolutionary===
[[Evolutionary theory|Evolutionary]] [[Scientific theory|theory]] may also explain the development of dark triad traits. It has been argued that evolutionary behavior predicts not only the development of dark triad personalities, but also the flourishing of such personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mealey|first1=L.|title=The sociobiology of sociopathy: An integrated evolutionary model|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=1995|volume=18|issue=03|pages=523–541|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00039595}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it has been found that individuals demonstrating dark triad personality can be highly successful in society.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, this success is typically short-lived.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The main evolutionary argument behind the dark triad traits emphasizes mating strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jonason|first1=P.K.|last2=Webster|first2=G.D.|last3=Schmitt|first3=D.P.|title=The dark triad: Facilitating a short-term mating strategy in men|journal=European Journal of Personality|date=2009|volume=23|issue=1|pages=5–18|doi=10.1002/per.698}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brumbach|first1=B.H.|last2=Figueredo|first2=A.J.|last3=Ellis|first3=B.J.|title=Effects of harsh and unpredictable environments in adolescence on development of life history strategies|journal=Human Nature|date=2009|volume=20|issue=1|pages=25–51|doi=10.1007/s12110-009-9059-3|pmc=2903759}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument focuses on the notion of life history strategy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rushton|first1=J.P.|title=Differential K theory: The sociobiology of individual and group differences|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=1985|volume=6|issue=4|pages=441–452|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(85)90137-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Life history strategy proposes that individuals differ in reproductive strategies; an emphasis on mating is termed a "fast life" strategy, while an emphasis on parenting is termed a "slow reproductive" strategy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; There is some evidence &lt;ref name="Jonason, Tost 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jonason |first1=Peter K. |last2=Tost |first2=Jeremy |title=I just cannot control myself: The Dark Triad and self-control |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=October 2010 |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=611–615 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2010.05.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jonason, Koenig, Tost 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jonason |first1=Peter K. |last2=Koenig |first2=Bryan L. |last3=Tost |first3=Jeremy |title=Living a fast life: The Dark Triad and Life History Theory |journal=Human Nature |date=19 November 2010 |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=428–442 |doi=10.1007/s12110-010-9102-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the dark triad traits are related to fast life history strategies; however, there have been some mixed results, and not all three dark triad traits have been related to this strategy. A more detailed approach&lt;ref name="McDonald, Donnellan, Navarrete 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McDonald |first1=Melissa M. |last2=Donnellan |first2=M. Brent |last3=Navarrete |first3=Carlos David |title=A life history approach to understanding the Dark Triad |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=April 2012 |volume=52 |issue=5 |pages=601–605 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; has attempted to account for some of these mixed results by analyzing the traits at a finer level of detail. These researchers found that while some components of the dark triad are related to a fast life strategy, other components are related to slow reproductive strategies.&lt;ref name="McDonald, Donnellan, Navarrete 2012"/&gt;

===Sub-clinical dimensions vs. disorders===
{{See also|Personality disorder}}
In general, clinicians treat these traits as [[pathological]], something that needs to be treated, and inherently undesirable, e.g. socially condemned or personally counter-productive. However, others argue that adaptive qualities may accompany the maladaptive ones. The evolutionary perspective (above) considers the dark triad to represent different mating strategies. Their frequency in the gene pool requires at least some local adaptation.

The everyday versions of these traits appear in student and community samples, where even high levels can be observed among individuals who manage to get along in daily life. Even in these samples, research indicates correlations with [[aggression]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jones D.N.|author2=Paulhus D. L.| year = 2010| title = Different provocations trigger aggression in narcissists and psychopaths|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|volume = 1|pages =12–18|doi=10.1177/1948550609347591}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[racism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Hodson| first1 = G.

Narcissism was discussed in the writings of [[Sigmund Freud]], and psychopathy as a clinical diagnosis was addressed in the early writings of [[Hervey Cleckley]] in 1941 with the publication of ''[[The Mask of Sanity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cleckly, H.&amp;nbsp;C. (1941). The Mask of Sanity: An Attempt to Reinterpret the So-Called Psychopathic Personality. St.&amp;nbsp;Louis, MO: Mosby.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the dimensional model of narcissism and psychopathy, complemented by self-report assessments that are appropriate for the general population, these traits can now be studied at the subclinical level.&lt;ref&gt;LeBreton, J. M., Binning, J. F., &amp; Adorno, A. J. (2005). Sub-clinical psychopaths. In D. L. Segal &amp; J. C. Thomas (Eds.), Comprehensive handbook of personality and psychopathology: Vol. 1. Personality and everyday functioning (pp. 388–411). New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; In the general population, the prevalence rates for sub-clinical and clinical psychopathy are estimated at around 1% and 0.2%, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Babiak| first1 = P.| last2 = Neumann| first2 = C.

With respect to empirical research, psychopathy was not formally studied until the 1970s with the pioneering efforts of [[Robert D. Hare|Robert Hare]], his [[Psychopathy Checklist]] (PCL), and its revision (PCL-R).&lt;ref&gt;Hare, R.D., (1991). The Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised. Toronto: Multi-Health Systems.&lt;/ref&gt; Hare notes in his book, ''Without Conscience'' &lt;ref&gt;Hare, R. D. (1999). ''Without conscience: The disturbing world of the psychopaths among us''. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; that asking psychopaths to self-report on psychologically important matters does not necessarily provide accurate or unbiased data. However, recent efforts have been made to study psychopathy in the dimensional realm using self-reported instruments, as with the Levenson Primary and Secondary Psychopathy Scales,&lt;ref name="Levenson M. R., Kiehl K. A., Fitzpatrick C. M. 1995 151–58"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Levenson M. R.|author2=Kiehl K. A.|author3=Fitzpatrick C.

(2015). Manual for the Self-Report Psychopathy scales (4th ed.). Toronto, Canada: Multi-Health Systems.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, assessment of narcissism required clinical interviews, until the popular "[[Narcissistic Personality Inventory]]" was created by Raskin and Hall in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Raskin R.|author2=Hall C.

Machiavellianism has never been referenced in any version of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) for psychological disorders. It has been treated as strictly a personality construct. The original published version of the Mach-IV &lt;ref&gt;Christie, R., &amp; Geis, F.&amp;nbsp;L. (1970). Studies in Machiavellianism. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; is still the most widely used in empirical research.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, D.&amp;nbsp;N., &amp; Paulhus, D.&amp;nbsp;L. (2009). Machiavellianism. In M.&amp;nbsp;R.

As noted previously, there is a good deal of conceptual and empirical overlap between the dark triad traits. For example, researchers have noted that all three traits share characteristics such as a lack of empathy,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; interpersonal hostility,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lynam|first1=D.R.|last2=Gaughan|first2=E.T.|title=Assessing the basic traits associated with psychopathy: Development and validation of the Elemental Psychopathy Assessment|journal=Psychological Assessment|date=2011|volume=23|issue=1|doi=10.1037/a0021146}}&lt;/ref&gt; and interpersonal offensiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Egan|first1=V.|last2=McCorkindale|first2=C.|title=Narcissism, vanity, personality and mating effort|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=2007|volume=43|issue=8|pages=2105–2115|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.06.034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likely due in part to this overlap, a number of measures have recently been developed that attempt to measure all three dark triad traits simultaneously, such as the Dirty Dozen &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jonason |first1=Peter K. |last2=Webster |first2=Gregory D. |title=The dirty dozen: A concise measure of the dark triad. |journal=Psychological Assessment |date=2010 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=420–432 |doi=10.1037/a0019265}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the short dark triad (SD3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=D.N.|last2=Paulhus|first2=D.L.|title=Introducing the Short Dark Triad (SD3) A Brief Measure of Dark Personality Traits|journal=Assessment|date=2014|volume=21|issue=1|pages=28–41|doi=10.1177/1073191113514105}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
At their root, however, most of these measures are questionnaire-style and require either self-response or observer-response (e.g., ratings from supervisors or coworkers). Both methods can prove problematic when attempting to measure any socially aversive trait as self-responders may be motivated to deceive.&lt;ref name="social exchange perspective 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Boyle|first1=E.H.|last2=Forsyth|first2=D.R.|last3=Banks|first3=G.C.|last4=McDaniel|first4=M.A.|title=A meta-analysis of the dark triad and work behavior: A social exchange perspective|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=2012|volume=97|issue=3|pages=557–79|doi=10.1037/a0025679|pmid=22023075|url=https://zenodo.org/record/850152|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827205904/https://zenodo.org/record/850152|archivedate=2017-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more specific confound might also exist for dark triad traits and Machiavellianism in particular: individuals who are skilled at deceiving and manipulating others should be perceived as low in deceptiveness and manipulation by others, and are therefore likely to receive inaccurate ratings.&lt;ref name="social exchange perspective 2012"/&gt;
	
Despite these criticisms and the acknowledged commonalities among the dark triad traits, there is evidence that the constructs are related yet distinct.

===Machiavellianism===
Named after the philosophy espoused by Niccolò Machiavelli in ''[[The Prince]]'', people who score high on this trait are cynical (in an amoral self-interest sense, not in a doubtful or skeptical sense), unprincipled, believe in interpersonal manipulation as the key for life success, and behave accordingly.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Scores on measures of [[Machiavellianism]] correlate negatively with [[agreeableness]] (r= -.47) and [[conscientiousness]] (r=-.34).&lt;ref name="Paulhus &amp; Williams 2002"/&gt; Machiavellianism is also significantly correlated with [[psychopathy]].&lt;ref name="Vernon, Villani, Vickers, Harris 2008"/&gt;

===Narcissism===
Individuals who score high on [[narcissism]] display grandiosity, entitlement, dominance, and superiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corry|first1=N.|last2=Merritt|first2=R.D.|last3=Mrug|first3=S.|last4=Pamp|first4=B.|title=The factor structure of the Narcissistic Personality Inventory|journal=Journal of Personality Assessment|date=2008|volume=90|issue=6|pages=593–600|doi=10.1080/00223890802388590}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narcissism has been found to correlate positively with [[extraversion]] (r = .42) and [[openness]] (r = .38) and negatively with [[agreeableness]] (r = -.36).&lt;ref name="Paulhus &amp; Williams 2002"/&gt; Narcissism has also been found to have a significant correlation with [[psychopathy]].&lt;ref name="Vernon, Villani, Vickers, Harris 2008"/&gt;

===Psychopathy===
Considered the most malevolent of the dark triad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rauthmann|first1=J.F.|title=The Dark Triad and interpersonal perception: Similarities and differences in the social consequences of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|date=2012|volume=3|issue=4|pages=487–496|doi=10.1177/1948550611427608}}&lt;/ref&gt; individuals who score high on [[psychopathy]] show low levels of empathy combined with high levels of impulsivity and thrill-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hare|first1=R.D.|title=Comparison of procedures for the assessment of psychopathy|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|date=1985|volume=53|issue=1|pages=7–16|doi=10.1037/0022-006x.53.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The similarity between psychopathy and [[antisocial personality disorder]] have been noted by some researchers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Psychopathy has been found to correlate with all of the Big Five personality factors: [[extraversion]] (r = .34), [[agreeableness]] (r = -.25), [[conscientiousness]] (r = -.24), [[neuroticism]] (r = -.34) and [[openness]] (r = .24).&lt;ref name="Vernon, Villani, Vickers, Harris 2008"/&gt;

==Group differences==
The most pronounced group difference is in gender: numerous studies have shown that men tend to score higher than women on narcissism,&lt;ref name="Egos inflating over time 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Twenge |first1=Jean M. |last2=Konrath |first2=Sara |last3=Foster |first3=Joshua D. |last4=Keith Campbell |first4=W. |last5=Bushman |first5=Brad J. |title=Egos Inflating Over Time: A Cross-Temporal Meta-Analysis of the Narcissistic Personality Inventory |journal=Journal of Personality |date=August 2008 |volume=76 |issue=4 |pages=875–902 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2008.00507.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machiavellianism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chonko|first1=L.B.|title=).

R., Kiehl K. A., Fitzpatrick C. M. 1995 151–58"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld S. O., Andrews B. P. 1996 488–524"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cale|first1=E.M.|last2=Lilienfeld|first2=S.O.|title=Sex differences in psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder: A review and integration|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|date=2002|volume=22|issue=8|pages=1179–1207|doi=10.1016/s0272-7358(01)00125-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zagon|first1=I.K.|last2=Jackson|first2=H.J.|title=Construct validity of a psychopathy measure|journal=Journal of Personality and Individual Differences|date=1994|pages=125–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the magnitude of the difference varies across traits and the measurement instruments used. One interesting finding related to narcissism—albeit one based on non-representative samples—is that while men continue to score higher than women, it seems that the gender gap has shrunk considerably when comparing cohort data from 1992 and 2006. More specifically, the aforementioned findings indicate that there has been a general increase in levels of narcissism over time among college students of both sexes, but comparatively, the average level of narcissism in women has increased more than the average level of narcissism in men.&lt;ref name="Egos inflating over time 2008"/&gt;
 
There is far less information available on race differences in dark triad traits, and the data that is available is not representative of the population at-large. For instance, a 2008 research study using undergraduate participants found that Caucasians reported higher levels of narcissism relative to Asians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trzesniewski|first1=K.H.|last2=Donnellan|first2=M.B.|title=Do today's young people really think they are so extraordinary? An examination of secular trends in narcissism and self-enhancement|journal=Psychological Science|date=2008|volume=19|issue=2|pages=181–188|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02065.x|pmid=18271867}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Twenge|first1=J.M.|last2=Foster|first2=J.D.|title=Mapping the scale of the narcissism epidemic: Increases in narcissism 2002–2007 within ethnic groups|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|date=2008|volume=42|issue=6|pages=1619–1622|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2008.06.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, another 2008 study using undergraduate participants found that Caucasians tended to score slightly higher than non-Caucasians on Machiavellianism.&lt;ref name="new Machiavellianism scale"/&gt; When attempting to discern whether there are ethnic differences in psychopathy, researchers have addressed the issue using different measurement instruments (e.g., the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale and The Psychopathic Personality Inventory), but no race differences have been found regardless of the measure used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epstein|first1=M.K.|last2=Poythress|first2=N.G.|last3=Brandon|first3=K.O.|title=The Self-Report Psychopathy Scale and Passive Avoidance Learning A Validation Study of Race and Gender Effects|journal=Assessment|date=2006|volume=13|issue=2|pages=197–207|doi=10.1177/1073191105284992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lander|first1=G.C.|last2=Lutz-ZOis|first2=C.J.|last3=Rye|first3=M.S.|last4=Goodnight|first4=J.A.|title=The differential association between alexithymia and primary versus secondary psychopathy|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=2012|volume=52|issue=1|pages=45–50|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.08.027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, when comparing Caucasians and African Americans from correctional, substance abuse, and psychiatric samples—groups with typically high prevalence rates of psychopathy—researchers again failed to find any meaningful group differences in psychopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skeem|first1=J.L.|last2=Edens|first2=J.F.|last3=Camp|first3=J.|last4=Colwell|first4=L.H.|title=Are there ethnic differences in levels of psychopathy?

Lynn proposes "that there are racial and ethnic differences in psychopathic personality conceptualised as a continuously distributed trait, such that high values of the trait are present in blacks and Native Americans, intermediate values in Hispanics, lower values in whites and the lowest values in East Asians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http:// https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222191018_Racial_and_ethnic_differences_in_psychopathic_personality|title=Racial and ethnic differences in psychopathic personality
|website=Research Gate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The focal variable when analyzing generational or cohort differences in dark triad traits has tended to be narcissism, arising from the hypothesis that so-called “[[Generation Me]]” or “Generation Entitlement” would exhibit higher levels of narcissism than previous generations. Indeed, based on analyses of responses to the [[Narcissistic Personality Inventory]] collected from over 16,000 U.S. undergraduate students between 1979 and 2006, it was concluded that average levels of narcissism had increased over time.&lt;ref name="Egos inflating over time 2008"/&gt; Similar results were obtained in a follow-up study that analyzed the changes within each college campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Twenge|first1=J.M.|last2=Campbell|first2=W.K.|title=Birth Cohort Differences in the Monitoring the Future Dataset and Elsewhere Further Evidence for Generation Me—Commentary on Trzesniewski &amp; Donnellan|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|date=2010|volume=5|issue=1|pages=81–88|doi=10.1177/1745691609357015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trzesniewski &amp; Donnellan (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trzesniewski|first1=K.H.|last2=Donnellan|first2=M.B.|title=Rethinking "Generation Me" a study of cohort effects from 1976–2006|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|date=2010|volume=5|issue=1|pages=58–75|doi=10.1177/1745691609356789}}&lt;/ref&gt; present conflicting evidence and argue that there have not been large changes in disposition or behavioral strategies across generations, although they do note that the current generation is less trusting and more cynical, which are both changes that might be indicative of an increase in Machiavellianism.

==Perspectives==

===In the workplace===
[[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]] identifies each of the three dark triadic personality traits as typically being prevalent in the [[workplace]] (see also [[Machiavellianism in the workplace]], [[narcissism in the workplace]] and [[psychopathy in the workplace]]).&lt;ref&gt;James O Office Politics: How to Thrive in a World of Lying, Backstabbing and Dirty Tricks (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Furnham &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The dark triad of personality: A ten year review|last = Furnham|first = Adrian|date = 2010|journal = Social and personality psychology compass|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2010) has identified that the dark triad is related to the acquisition of leadership positions and interpersonal influence. In a meta-analysis of dark triad and workplace outcomes, Jonason and colleagues (2012) found that each of the dark triad traits were related to manipulation in the workplace, but each via unique mechanisms. Specifically, Machiavellianism was related with the use of excessive charm in manipulation, narcissism was related with the use of physical appearance, and psychopathy was related with physical threats.&lt;ref name="Jonason, Slomski, Partyka 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jonason |first1=Peter K. |last2=Slomski |first2=Sarah |last3=Partyka |first3=Jamie |title=The Dark Triad at work: How toxic employees get their way |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=February 2012 |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=449–453 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.11.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonason and colleagues also found that the dark triad traits fully mediated the relationship between gender and workplace manipulation. The dark triad traits have also been found to be fairly well-represented in upper-level management and CEOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Accounting as a facilitator of extreme narcissism|last = Amernic|first = J.|date = 2010|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet trolls===
{{Main article|Troll (Internet)}}
Recent studies have found that people who are identified as trolls tend to have dark personality traits and show signs of [[Antisocial personality disorder|sadism]], [[antisocial behavior]], psychopathy, and Machiavellianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buckels | first1 = E.E. | last2 = Trapnell | first2 = P.D. | last3 = Paulhus | first3 = D.L. | year = 2013 | title = Trolls Just Want to Have Fun | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences| doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2014.01.016 | volume=67 | pages=97–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/your-online-secrets/201409/internet-trolls-are-narcissists-psychopaths-and-sadists | title = Internet Trolls Are Narcissists, Psychopaths, and Sadists}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/science/2014/02/science-confirms-online-trolls-are-horrible-people-also-sadists/ | title = Science confirms: Online trolls are horrible people (also, sadists!) | date = 20 February 2014 | accessdate = 2 November 2016 | publisher = ''Ars Technica'' | author = Nate Anderson | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161104004119/http://arstechnica.com/science/2014/02/science-confirms-online-trolls-are-horrible-people-also-sadists/ | archivedate = 4 November 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 case study suggested that there are a number of similarities between anti-social and [[Flaming (Internet)|flame]] trolling activities and the 2014 survey indicated that trolling is an Internet manifestation of [[Sadistic personality disorder|everyday sadism]]. Both studies suggest that this trolling may be linked to [[bullying]] in both adolescents and adults.

===As a mating strategy===
Studies have suggested that on average, those who exhibit the dark triad of personality traits have an [[r/K selection theory|accelerated mating strategy]], reporting more sex partners, more favorable attitudes towards casual sex,&lt;ref name="short-term mating"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jonason |first1=Peter K. |last2=Li |first2=Norman P. |last3=Webster |first3=Gregory D. |last4=Schmitt |first4=David P. |title=The dark triad: Facilitating a short-term mating strategy in men |journal=European Journal of Personality |date=February 2009 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=5–18 |doi=10.1002/per.698}}&lt;/ref&gt; lowered standards in their short-term mates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jonason |first1=Peter K. |last2=Valentine |first2=Katherine A. |last3=Li |first3=Norman P. |last4=Harbeson |first4=Carmelita L. |title=Mate-selection and the Dark Triad: Facilitating a short-term mating strategy and creating a volatile environment |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=October 2011 |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=759–763 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.06.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; a tendency to steal or poach mates from others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jonason |first1=Peter K. |last2=Li |first2=Norman P. |last3=Buss |first3=David M. |title=The costs and benefits of the Dark Triad: Implications for mate poaching and mate retention tactics |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=March 2010 |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=373–378 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2009.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; more risk-taking in the form of substance abuse,&lt;ref name="Jonason, Koenig, Tost 2010"/&gt; a tendency to prefer immediate but smaller amounts of money over delayed but larger amounts of money,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jonason | first1 = P.

The evidence is mixed regarding the exact link between the dark triad and reproductive success. For example, there is a lack of empirical evidence for reproductive success in the case of psychopathy.&lt;ref name="gap"/&gt; Additionally, these traits are not universally short-term-oriented&lt;ref name="Jonason, Tost 2010"/&gt; nor are they all impulsive.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Furthermore, much of the research reported pertaining to the dark triad cited in the above paragraph is based on statistical procedures that assume the dark triad are a single construct, in spite of genetic &lt;ref name = "Vernon, Villani, Vickers, Harris 2008"/&gt; and meta-analytic evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref name="social exchange perspective 2012"/&gt;

==Related concepts==

=== Big Five ===
The [[Big Five personality traits|five factor model of personality]] has significant relationships with the dark triad combined and with each of the dark triad’s traits. The dark triad overall is negatively related to both [[agreeableness]] and [[conscientiousness]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; More specifically, Machiavellianism captures a suspicious versus trusting view of human nature which is also captured by the Trust sub-scale on the agreeableness trait.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Machiavellian beliefs and personality: Construct invalidity of the Machiavellianism dimension|last = Hunter|first = J.

Psychopathy has the strongest correlations with low dutifulness and deliberation aspects of Conscientiousness.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Honesty-humility ===
The [[Honesty-humility factor of the HEXACO model of personality|honesty-humility]] factor from the [[HEXACO model of personality structure|HEXACO]] model of personality is used to measure sincerity, fairness, greed avoidance, and modesty. Honesty-Humility has been found to be strongly, negatively correlated to the dark triad traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aghababaei | first1 = N. | last2 = Mohammadtabar | first2 = S. | last3 = Saffarinia | first3 = M. | year = 2014 | title = Dirty Dozen vs. the H factor: Comparison of the Dark Triad and Honesty–Humility in prosociality, religiosity, and happiness | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 6–10 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2014.03.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, all three dark triad traits are strongly negatively correlated with Honesty-Humility.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The conceptual overlap of the three traits which represents a tendency to manipulate and exploit others for personal gain defines the negative pole of the honesty-humility factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = K. | last2 = Ashton | first2 = M.

===Dark tetrad===
Several researchers have suggested expanding the dark triad to contain a fourth dark trait. Everyday sadism, defined as the enjoyment of cruelty, is the most common addition.&lt;ref name="apa-sadism"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/everyday-sadists-take-pleasure-in-others-pain.html|title=Everyday Sadists Take Pleasure In Others’ Pain|work=Association for Psychological Science|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180527025804/https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/everyday-sadists-take-pleasure-in-others-pain.html|archivedate=2018-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While sadism is highly correlated with the dark triad, researchers have shown that sadism predicts [[anti-social behavior]] beyond the dark triad.&lt;ref name="Contributions to juvenile delinquency"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buckels | first1 = E.E. | last2 = Jones | first2 = D.

===Vulnerable dark triad===
The vulnerable dark triad (VDT) comprises three related and similar constructs: vulnerable narcissism, factor 2 psychopathy, and [[borderline personality disorder]]. A study found that these three constructs are significantly related to one another and manifest similar [[nomological]] networks. Although the VDT members are related to negative emotionality and antagonistic interpersonal styles, they are also related to [[introversion]] and [[disinhibition]]. The study does note however that its findings are based largely on the self-reports of parents of White undergrad students rather than information gleaned from clinical evaluation.&lt;ref name="vdt"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://wkeithcampbell.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/VulnerableDarkTriad.pdf | title=Searching for a Vulnerable Dark Triad: Comparing Factor 2 Psychopathy, Vulnerable Narcissism, and Borderline Personality Disorder | author1=Miller, JD. | author2=Dir, A. | author3=Gentile, B. | author4=Wilson, L. | author5=Pryor, LR. | author6=Campbell, K. | journal=Journal of Personality | date=October 2010 | volume=78 | issue=5 | pages=1529–1564 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2010.00660.x | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913131007/http://wkeithcampbell.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/VulnerableDarkTriad.pdf | archivedate=2014-09-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malignant narcissism ===
Within the clinical/pathological realm, narcissism can manifest itself in a particularly severe form known as [[malignant narcissism]]. Malignant narcissism presents not only with signs and symptoms of grandiose narcissism, but also includes features of paranoia, sadism, aggression, and psychopathy (particularly antisocial behaviors).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/492228 Lenzenweger] M.F., Clarkin J.F., Caligor E., Cain N.M., &amp; Kernberg O.F.

The '''doctrine of exoneration of liens''' (sometimes simply referred to as "'''doctrine of exoneration'''") refers to a [[common law]] rule. The rule says that encumbrances (i.e. a [[mortgage law|mortgage]]) of a property conveyed by a [[Will (law)|will]] is discharged with funds from the originating [[Estate (law)|estate]], not from the property itself.&lt;ref name=WT&amp;E&gt;

In [[religious studies]] and [[folkloristics]], '''folk religion''', '''popular religion''', or '''vernacular religion''' comprises various forms and expressions of [[religion]] that are distinct from the official doctrines and practices of [[organized religion]]. The precise definition of folk religion varies among scholars. Sometimes also termed '''popular belief''', it consists of [[ethnic]] or regional [[religion|religious]] customs under the umbrella of a [[religion]], but outside official [[doctrine]] and practices.&lt;ref name="Bowman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowman | first=Marion |editor-first=Steven| editor-last=Sutcliffe |title=Religion: empirical studies |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year=2004 |pages=3–4 |chapter=Chapter 1: Phenomenology, Fieldwork, and Folk Religion |isbn=0-7546-4158-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BU2BSj4dcHMC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22folk+religion%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "folk religion" is generally held to encompass two related but separate subjects.  The first is the religious dimension of [[folk culture]], or the folk-cultural dimensions of religion. The second refers to the study of [[syncretism]]s between two cultures with different stages of formal expression, such as the melange of African folk beliefs and [[Roman Catholicism]] that led to the development of [[Vodun]] and [[Santería]], and similar mixtures of formal religions with folk cultures.

[[Chinese folk religion]], folk Christianity, folk Hinduism, and folk Islam are examples of folk religion associated with major religions. The term is also used, especially by the [[clergy]] of the faiths involved, to describe the desire of people who otherwise infrequently attend religious [[worship]], do not belong to a [[church body|church]] or similar religious society, and who have not made a formal profession of [[faith]] in a particular [[creed]], to have religious weddings or funerals, or (among Christians) to have their children [[baptism|baptised]].&lt;ref name="Bowman"/&gt;

==Definition==
In ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions'', [[John Bowker (theologian)|John Bowker]] characterized "folk religion" as either "religion which occurs in small, local communities which does not adhere to the norms of large systems" or "the appropriation of religious beliefs and practices at a popular level."{{sfn|Bowker|2003}}

[[Don Yoder]] argued that there were five separate ways of defining folk religion.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=12}} The first was a perspective rooted in a [[cultural evolution]]ary framework which understood folk religion as representing the survivals of older forms of religion; in this, it would constitute "the survivals, in an official religious context, of beliefs and behavior inherited from earlier stages of the culture's development".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=12}} This definition would view folk religion in Catholic Europe as the survivals of pre-Christian religion and the folk religion in Protestant Europe as the survivals of Medieval Catholicism.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=12}} The second definition identified by Yoder was the view that folk religion represented the mixture of an official religion with forms of ethnic religion; this was employed to explain the place of folk religion in the syncretic belief systems of the Americas, where Christianity had blended with the religions of [[indigenous American]] and [[indigenous African|African]] communities.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=12&amp;ndash;13}}

Yoder's third definition was that often employed within folkloristics, which held that folk religion was "the interaction of belief, ritual, custom, and mythology in traditional societies", representing that which was often pejoratively characterised as [[superstition]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=13}} The fourth definition provided by Yoder stated that folk religion represented the "folk interpretation and expression of religion". Noting that this definition would not encompass beliefs that were largely unconnected from organised religion, such as in [[witchcraft]], he therefore altered this definition by including the concept of "folk [[religiosity]]", thereby defining folk religion as "the deposit in culture of folk religiosity, the full range of folk attitudes to religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=13&amp;ndash;14}} His fifth and final definition represented a "practical working definition" that combined elements from these various other definitions. Thus, he summarized folk religion as "the totality of all those views and practices of religion that exist among the people apart from and alongside the strictly theological and liturgical forms of the official religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=14}}

Yoder described "folk religion" as existing "in a complex society in relation to and in tension with the organized religion(s) of that society. Its relatively unorganized character differentiates it from organized religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=11}}

Alternately, the sociologist of religion [[Matthias Zic Varul]] defined "folk religion" as "the relatively un-reflected aspect of ordinary practices and beliefs that are oriented towards, or productive of, something beyond the immediate here-and-now: everyday transcendence".{{sfn|Varul|2015|p=449}}

===Historical development===

In Europe the study of "folk religion" emerged from the study of ''religiöse Volkskund'', a German term which was used in reference to "the religious dimension of folk-culture, or the folk-cultural dimension of religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=2}} This term was first employed by a German [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] preacher, [[Paul Drews]], in a 1901 article that he published which was titled "''Religiöse Volkskunde, eine Aufgabe der praktischen Theologie''". This article was designed to be read by young Lutheran preachers leaving the seminary, to equip them for the popular variants of Lutheranism that they would encounter among their congregations and which would differ from the official, doctrinal Lutheranism that they had been accustomed to.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=2&amp;ndash;3}} Although developing within a religious environment, the term came to be adopted by German academics in the field of [[folkloristics]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=3}} During the 1920s and 1930s, theoretical studies of ''religiöse Volkskund'' had been produced by the folklorists [[Josef Weigert]], [[Werner Boette]], and [[Max Rumpf]], all of whom had focused on religiosity within German peasant communities.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=3}} Over the coming decades, [[Georg Schreiber]] established an Institut für religiöse Volkskund in [[Munich]] while a similar department was established in [[Salzburg]] by [[Hanns Koren]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=3&amp;ndash;4}} Other prominent academics involved in the study of the phenomenon were [[Heinrich Schauert]] and [[Rudolf Kriss]], the latter of whom collected one of the largest collections of folk-religious art and material culture in Europe, later housed in Munich's [[Bayerisches Nationalmuseum]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=3&amp;ndash;4}} Throughout the 20th century, many studies were made of folk religion in Europe, paying particular attention to such subjects as [[pilgrimage]] and the use of [[shrines]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=3}}

In the Americas, the study of folk religion developed among [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] studying the syncretistic cultures of the Caribbean and Latin America.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} The pioneer in this field was Redfield, whose 1930 book ''Tepoztlán: A Mexican Village'' contrasted and examined the relationship between "folk religion" and "official religion" in a peasant community.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} Yoder later noted that although the earliest known usage of the term "folk religion" in the English language was unknown, it probably developed as a translation of the German ''Volksreligion''.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} One of the earliest prominent usages of the term was in the title of [[Joshua Trachtenberg]]'s 1939 work ''Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion''.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} The term also gained increasing usage within the academic field of [[comparative religion]], appearing in the titles of [[Ichiro Hori]]'s ''Folk Religion in Japan'', [[Martin Nilsson]]'s ''Greek Folk Religion'', and [[Charles Miller Leslie|Charles Leslie]]'s reader, the ''Anthropology of Folk Religion''.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} Courses on the study of folk religion came to be taught at various universities in the United States, such as [[John Messenger]]'s at [[Indiana University]] and [[Don Yoder]]'s at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}}
Although the subject of folk religion fell within the remit of scholars operating in both folkloristics and religious studies, by 1974 Yoder noted that U.S.-based academics in the latter continued to largely ignore it, instead focusing on the study of [[theology]] and institutionalised religion; he contrasted this with the situation in Europe, where historians of religion had devoted much time to studying folk religiosity.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=6}} He also lamented that many U.S.-based folklorists also neglected the subject of religion because it did not fit within the standard genre-based system for cataloguing folklore.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=9}}

The term "folk religion" came to be increasingly rejected in the 1990s and 2000s by scholars seeking more precise terminology.{{sfn|Kapaló|2013|p=4}}

===Problems and critique===

Yoder noted that one problem with the use of the term "folk religion" was that it did not fit into the work of those scholars who used the term "religion" in reference solely to [[organized religion]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=10}} He highlighted the example of the prominent sociologist of religion [[Émile Durkheim]], who insisted that "religion" was organized in order to contrast it with "[[magic (paranormal)|magic]]".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=10}} Yoder noted that scholars adopting these perspectives often preferred the term "folk belief" over "folk religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=10}}

A second problem with the use of "folk religion" that Yoder highlighted was that some scholars, particularly those operating in the [[sociology of religion]], used the term as a synonym for [[ethnic religion]] (which is alternately known as national religion or tribal religion), meaning a religion closely tied to a particular ethnic or national group and is thus contrasted with a "universal religion" which cuts across ethnic and national boundaries.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=10&amp;ndash;11}} Among the scholars to have adopted this use of terminology are E. Wilbur Bock.{{sfn|Bock|1966|p=204}}

The folklorist Leonard Norman Primiano argued that the use of "folk religion", as well as related terms like "popular religion" and "unofficial religion", by scholars, does "an extreme disservice" to the forms of religiosity that scholarship is examining, because &amp;ndash; in his opinion &amp;ndash; such terms are "residualistic, [and] derogatory".{{sfn|Primiano|1995|p=38}} He argued that using such terminology implies that there is "a pure element" to religion "which is in some way transformed, even contaminated, by its exposure to human communities".{{sfn|Primiano|1995|p=39}} As a corrective, he suggested that scholars use "vernacular religion" as an alternative.{{sfn|Primiano|1995|pp=41&amp;ndash;42}} Defining this term, Primiano stated that "vernacular religion" is, "by definition, religion as it is lived: as human beings encounter, understand, interpret, and practice it. Since religion inherently involves interpretation, it is impossible for the religion of an individual not to be vernacular".{{sfn|Primiano|1995|p=44}}

Kapaló was critical of this approach, deeming it "mistaken" and arguing that switching from "folk religion" to "vernacular religion" results in the scholar "picking up a different selection of things from the world".{{sfn|Kapaló|2013|p=9}} He cautioned that both terms were "ideological and semantic load[ed]" and warned scholars to pay attention to the associations that each word had.{{sfn|Kapaló|2013|pp=15&amp;ndash;16}}

==Chinese folk religion==
[[Chinese folk religion]] or Shenism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GBdX2ELnkXQC&amp;pg=PA21 |title= Reinventing Chinese Syncretic Religion: Shenism |publisher= Google |date = 2007-02-23 |accessdate= 2011-11-20|isbn= 9789812308658 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.straitstimes.com/2009/9/7/how-we-came-to-pai-shen | title = How we came to ‘pai shen’ | publisher = Straits times | date = 2009-09-07 | accessdate = 2011-11-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111207225051/http://blogs.straitstimes.com/2009/9/7/how-we-came-to-pai-shen/ | archivedate = 2011-12-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9MmNaNebFD8C&amp;pg=PA198 |title = Religious Diversity in Singapore |publisher = Google |date = 2001-09-11 | accessdate =2011-11-20|isbn = 9789812307545 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are labels used to describe the collection of [[ethnic religion|ethnic religious]] traditions which have historically comprised the predominant belief system in [[China]] and among [[Han Chinese]] ethnic groups up to the present day. Shenism describes [[Chinese mythology]] and includes the worship of ''[[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'' ([[spirit]], [[Deity|god]], [[awareness]], [[consciousness]]) which can be [[nature god|nature deities]], [[Taizu (disambiguation)|Taizu]] or clan deities, [[city god]]s, [[national god|national deities]], [[culture hero]]es and [[demigod]]s, [[Chinese dragon|dragons]] and [[veneration of the dead|ancestors]]. "Shenism" as a term was first published by AJA Elliot in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = High beam | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-126163460.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese folk religion is sometimes categorized with [[Taoism]], since over the centuries institutional Taoism has been attempting to assimilate or administrate local religions. More accurately, Taoism can be defined as a branch of Shenism, since it sprang out of folk religion and [[Chinese philosophy]]. Chinese folk religion is sometimes seen as a constituent part of Chinese traditional religion, but more often, the two are regarded as synonymous.  With around 454 million adherents, or about 6.6% of the world population,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Religion | year = 2011 | title = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese folk religion is one of the [[major religious groups|major religious traditions in the world]]. In [[People's Republic of China|China]] more than 30% of the population adheres to Shenism or Taoism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://chartsbin.com/view/sgx |title=Chinese Folk Religion Adherents by Country |publisher=Charts bin |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate = 2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folk Islam==
{{further |Islamic mythology|Druze|Alevi|Alawi|Kebatinan|Abangan|Adat}}
Folk Islam is an [[umbrella term]] used to collectively describe forms of [[Islam]] that incorporate native folk beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook|first= Chris|title = Spirituality and Psychiatry| publisher= [[RCPsych]] Publications | year = 2009 | page = 242 | isbn = 978-1-904671-71-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Folk Islam has been described as the Islam of the "urban poor, country people, and tribes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ridgeon | first = Lloyd | title =Major World Religions: From Their Origins To The Present | publisher =[[Routledge]]|year=2003|page=280|isbn = 978-0-415-29796-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] or "High" Islam (Gellner, 1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author-link = Sinisa Malesevic | last= Malešević| first = Siniša | title = Ernest Gellner and Contemporary Social Thought|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2007|page=189|isbn = 978-0-521-70941-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sufism]] and Sufi concepts are often integrated into Folk Islam.

Various practices and beliefs have been identified with the concept of "folk Islam". They include the following:
* belief in traditional magic systems and [[Religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] rituals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Masud| first= Muhammad Khalid |title = Islam and Modernity: Key Issues and Debates| publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|year= 2009 | page = 138 | isbn = 978-0-7486-3793-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Makris | first =JP |title= Islam in the Middle East: A Living Tradition |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|year=2006|page=49|isbn = 978-1-4051-1603-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folk Judaism==
In one of the first major academic works on the subject, titled ''Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion'', Joshua Trachtenberg provided a definition of Jewish folk religion as consisting of ideas and practices that whilst not meeting with the approval of religious leaders enjoyed wide popularity such that they must be included in what he termed the field of religion.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion'', Joshua Trachtenberg, 1939, Forgotten Books, Preface, pg xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; This included unorthodox beliefs about demons and angels, and magical practices.

Later studies have emphasized the significance of the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] to the many Jewish folk customs linked to mourning and in particular to the belief in ''hibbut ha-qever''  (torture of the grave) a belief that the dead are tortured in their grave for three days after burial by demons until they remember their names. This idea began with early eschatalogical [[aggadah]] and was then further developed by the kabbalists.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion'', Edited by Adele Berlin,  Oxford University Press, 2011, pg 344,&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Raphael Patai has been acknowledged as one of the first to utilize anthropology to study Jewish folk religion.&lt;ref&gt;''Fields of Offerings: Studies in Honor of Raphael Patai'',
by Victor D. Sanua, pg 28&lt;/ref&gt; In particular he has drawn attention to the important role of the female divine element,&lt;ref&gt;''Fields of Offerings: Studies in Honor of Raphael Patai'', by Victor D. Sanua, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1983, pg 27&lt;/ref&gt; which he sees in the goddess [[Asherah]], the [[Shekhinah]], the [[Matronit]], and [[Lilith]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fields of Offerings: Studies in Honor of Raphael Patai'', by Victor D. Sanua, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1983, pg 2&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Writer Stephen Sharot has stated that Jewish popular religion in common with other forms of folk religion, has a focus on the [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]], or [[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturgical]], i.e. it is used to assist in protecting the individual from sickness, and misfortune.  He emphasizes that while Rabbinical Judaism dealt with orthodox Jewish ritual, and [[halakah]], magicians claimed to use unorthodox magical rituals to help people in everyday life.  He points to the example of a relatively professionalised type of magician being the [[Baal Shem|ba'al shem]] of Poland, who beginning in the 16th century thrived with the popularity of practical kabbalah in the 18th century.  These ba'al shem promised to use their knowledge of the names of god, and the angels, along with exorcism, chiromancy, and [[herbal medicine]] to bring harm to enemies, and  success in areas of social life such as marriage, and childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;''Comparative Perspectives on Judaisms and Jewish Identities'', By Stephen Sharot, Wayne State University Press, 2011, pg 58&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Liebman]] has written that the essence of the folk religion of American Jews is their social ties to one another, illustrated by the finding  that religious practices that would prevent social integration -such as a strict interpretation of  dietary laws and the Sabbath- have been abandoned, whilst the practices that are followed -such as the [[Passover seder]], social rites of passage, and the High Holy Days- are ones that strengthen Jewish family and community integration.&lt;ref&gt;''Comparative Perspectives on Judaisms and Jewish Identities'', By Stephen Sharot, Wayne State University Press, 2011, pg 152&lt;/ref&gt; Liebman described the rituals and beliefs of contemporary Jewish folk religion in his works, ''The Ambivalent American Jew'' (1973) and ''American Jewry: Identity and Affiliation''.

==In sociology==
In [[sociology]], folk religion is often contrasted with [[elite religion]]. Folk religion is defined as the beliefs, practices, rituals and symbols originating from sources other than the religion's leadership. Folk religion in many instances is tolerated by the religion's leadership, although they may consider it an error.&lt;ref&gt;Leibman, Charles. "The Religion of the American Jew". ''The Ambivalent American Jew''. Jewish Publication Society. 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar concept is [[lived religion]], the study of religion as practiced by believers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12955">'''Golden City''' is a fictional city that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Dark Horse Comics]], and is part of the [[Comics Greatest World]] imprint.
It was created by [[Team CGW]].
Golden City first appeared in ''Comics' Greatest World: Golden City'' Week 1, in 1993.  It is the home and base of operations for [[Catalyst: Agents of Change]].

== Location ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;A small West Coast town turned burgeoning superhero Utopia; transformed by a young superwoman's extraordinary vision.  No crime, no poverty, no pollution.  An exclusive community; progressive, clean, and efficiently run.  Golden City is the best of humanity personified; home to the gods.

But there is trouble in this paradise: dreamers, the homeless, the hopeless, and the dying all see Golden City as their personal panacea.  Roads are backed up for miles in all directions with those who want to move to Golden City.{{ref|[1]}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Golden City is located in northwestern California. 
In the Comics' Greatest World Sourcebook, it is said to be on West Coast of the United States. 
The Titan Special confirmed this and showed it to be near the Oregon border.

== History ==
This character history covers the entire published history of the Dark Horse Comics and Comics' Greatest World environ Golden City.

=== Grace ===
{{main|Grace (Dark Horse Comics)}}
'''Golden City''' was originally just another small American town on the California coast, but that was before the woman called '''Grace''' arrived. 
Becoming the town's mayor and "founding mother," Grace turned Golden City into a "megalopolis" and "a contemporary utopia" {{ref|[2]}}.

At one point it is said Grace was one of the first "magick people," rising out of "their midst to lead them" {{ref|[3]}}.
However, this is stated in a fairy tale being told by a woman to her son.
On a side note, if the information in the fairy tale can be taken at face value, Titan was not the first hero to join Grace in Golden City.

=== Titan and Golden Boy ===
{{main|Titan (Dark Horse Comics)}}
Frank Wells, a teenage runaway and metahuman, finds his way to Golden City and is trained by Grace to become '''Titan'''.
He was eventually given a boy sidekick named Elmore Meyer AKA '''Golden Boy'''.

Golden Boy was a public relations tool and having no apparent powers, he was more of a liability than an aid to Titan. 
On Golden Boy's first solo mission he was captured and tortured, resulting in the loss of an eye. 
Grace then retired the boy, having his mind erased by her aide '''Madison'''.

Over the next few years, Titan proved himself, but as he saw it "in the end, Grace betrayed me... betrayed Titan!" {{ref|[4]}}. 
The betrayal came with Grace's announcement to the world of a hero for the new age of Golden City, '''Rebel'''.

===Catalyst===
{{main|Catalyst: Agents of Change}}
'''Warmaker''', a former United States soldier turned supervillain, is sent by the government to be imprisoned in The Vault, a super-prison located in Golden City. 
He escapes (or is allowed to escape by Grace) and begins a rampage.

He faces the heroes of Golden City, including newcomers '''Mecha''' and '''Ruby''', causing massive amounts of destruction to the city, until Grace arrives to face him. 
She easily defeats Warmaker, but Titan attacks him for no reason. 
Warmaker strikes Titan knocking him into '''Rhapsody''', the local healer, who falls into a crater and is killed.

Grace uses Warmaker's escape and the death of Rhapsody as a rallying point and announces Golden City’s secession from the United States.

=== War of Secession ===
After Grace refuses to kill '''Vortex''', the US Army attacks.  
The heroes of Golden City, now officially teamed together as '''Catalyst''', battle both ground troops and aircraft while simultaneously protecting the city and its citizens from debris and fallout from the radioactive weapons being used by the army.

An armored super-soldier called Grenade is sent in by the army. 
He battles and is defeated by Titan, Warmaker, and Ruby, before self destructing releasing radiation into the wheat field battleground. 
Negative media coverage forces the government to reach a settlement with Grace.

=== Will To Power ===
{{main|Will to Power (comics)}}
Titan leaves the team to work for the government. 
This begins a downward spiral for him and he becomes progressively more and more demented. 
Grace takes the command of the situation placing Titan in the Vault. 
He escapes and confronts the Catalyst team.

Realizing they are outgunned, Grace sends Titan to face down the man from the '''Vortex'''. 
Then, she teleports to Cinnabar Flats to warn Vortex of Titan’s impending arrival. 
Vortex kills Titan as vengeance for the death of Lt. Anderson, his friend. 
Taking Anderson’s body, he reenters the vortex, leaving Grace to safeguard his base.

=== Law ===
{{main|Law (comics)}}
Having faked the death of Grace, the villain '''Law''' manipulates his way into power as Golden City's new ruler. He slowly weeds out Grace loyalists, killing Madison and driving Mecha and Warmaker out of Golden City.

Law then has a large gate built at the entrance to Golden City, this '''Judgment Gate''' is powered by "the essence of the Maelstrom" and will mutate, enhance or kill all that pass through it {{ref|[5]}}. Less than 10% of those who pass through the gate are enhanced.

He then has the President of the United States kidnapped and imprisoned in The Vault, as well as annexed the state of California as a refuge for all those enhanced by the Maelstrom.

Before the full extent of Law's plans is revealed he is killed by a [[Predator (alien)|Predator]], commonly known as one of the aliens from the Predator movies. 
Grace and her allies then begin the task of "putting Golden City back together" {{ref|[6]}}.

== The Judgment Gate ==
A mechanical device created by scientists working for Law, it is powered by energies from '''The Maelstrom''' and has one of three effects on all who pass through it: "enhancement, mutation, or death as the Maelstrom energy decides" {{ref|[3]}}.
It is the gateway from the outside world into Golden City open for all who deem themselves worthy to pass through. Only 7.6% of those who pass through the gate gain abilities and of those, most are "insignificant abilities." The rest are killed or mutated, with the mutates executed by Law's troops, "and still they come." {{ref|[7]}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11881">In [[agriculture]], '''green manure''' is created by leaving uprooted or sown crop parts to wither on a field so that they serve as a [[mulch]] and [[soil amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/green+manure|title=Green manure - Define Green manure at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plants used for green manure are often [[cover crop]]s grown primarily for this purpose. Typically, they are ploughed under and incorporated into the [[soil]] while green or shortly after flowering. Green manure is commonly associated with [[organic farming]] and can play an important role in sustainable annual cropping systems.

==Functions==
Green manures usually perform multiple functions that include soil improvement and soil protection:

* [[Leguminous]] green manures such as [[clover]] and [[vetch]] contain [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] [[symbiotic]] [[bacteria]] in [[root nodules]] that fix atmospheric nitrogen in a form that plants can use. This performs the vital function of fertilization.  If desired, [[animal]] manures may also be added.

:Depending on the species of cover crop grown, the amount of nitrogen released into the soil lies between 40 and 200 pounds per acre. With green manure use, the amount of nitrogen that is available to the succeeding crop is usually in the range of 40-60% of the total amount of nitrogen that is contained within the green manure crop.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

* Green manure acts mainly as [[Soil acidification|soil-acidifying]] matter to decrease the alkalinity/pH of [[alkali soils]] by generating [[humic acid]] and [[acetic acid]].
* Incorporation of [[cover crops]] into the soil allows the nutrients held within the green manure to be released and made available to the succeeding crops. This results immediately from an increase in abundance of soil microorganisms from the degradation of plant material that aid in the decomposition of this fresh material.  This additional decomposition also allows for the re-incorporation of nutrients that are found in the soil in a particular form such as [[nitrogen]] (N), [[potassium]] (K), [[phosphorus]] (P), [[calcium]] (Ca), [[magnesium]] (Mg), and [[sulfur]] (S).
* Microbial activity from incorporation of cover crops into the soil leads to the formation of [[mycelium]] and viscous materials which benefit the health of the soil by increasing its [[soil structure]] (i.e. by aggregation).&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;
:The increased percentage of organic matter ([[biomass]]) improves [[water]] infiltration and retention, aeration, and other soil characteristics. The soil is more easily turned or tilled than non-aggregated soil. Further aeration of the soil results from the ability of the root systems of many green manure crops to efficiently penetrate compact soils. The amount of [[humus]] found in the soil also increases with higher rates of decomposition, which is beneficial for the growth of the crop succeeding the green manure crop. Non-leguminous crops are primarily used to increase biomass.
*The [[root]] systems of some varieties of green manure grow deep in the soil and bring up nutrient resources unavailable to shallower-rooted crops.
* Common [[Cover crop#Weed management|cover crop functions of weed suppression]]. Non-leguminous crops are primarily used (e.g. [[buckwheat]])&lt;ref name="Lawrence 1980 145"/&gt; The deep rooting properties of many green manure crops make them efficient at suppressing [[weed]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vasilakoglou, Ioannis, Dhima, Kico, Anastassopoulos, Elias, Lithourgidis, Anastasios, Gougoulias, Nikolaos, and Chouliaras, Nikolaos. 2011. Oregano green manure for weed suppression in sustainable cotton and corn fields. Weed Biology and Management 11:38-48.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some green manure crops, when allowed to [[flower]], provide [[Forage (honeybee)|forage]] for pollinating [[insect]]s. Green manure crops also often provide habitat for predatory beneficial insects, which allow for a reduction in the application of insecticides where cover crops are planted.
* Some green manure crops (e.g. [[winter wheat]] and [[winter rye]]) can also be used for grazing.&lt;ref name="Lawrence 1980 145"/&gt;
* [[Erosion control]] is often also taken into account when selecting which green manure cover crop to plant.
* Some [[Cover crop#Pest management|green crops reduce plant insect pests]] and [[Cover crop#Disease management|diseases]]. [[Verticillium wilt]] is especially reduced in potato plants.&lt;ref&gt;Larkin, Robert P., Honeycutt, Wayne, and Olanya Modesto, O. 2011.  Management of Verticillium Wilt of Potato with Disease-Suppressive Green Manures and as Affected by Previous Cropping History. Plant Dis. 95:568-576.&lt;/ref&gt;

Incorporation of green manures into a farming system can drastically reduce the need for additional products such as supplemental fertilizers and pesticides.

Limitations to consider in the use of green manure are time, energy, and resources (monetary and natural) required to successfully grow and utilize these cover crops. Consequently, it is important to choose green manure crops based on the growing region and annual precipitation amounts to ensure efficient growth and use of the cover crop(s).

==Nutrient creation==
Green manure is broken down into plant nutrient components by [[heterotrophic]] bacteria that consumes organic matter. Warmth and moisture contribute to this process, similar to creating [[compost]] fertilizer. The plant matter releases large amounts of carbon dioxide and weak acids that react with insoluble soil minerals to release beneficial nutrients. Soils that are high in [[calcium]] minerals, for example, can be given green manure to generate a higher [[phosphate]] content in the soil, which in turn acts as a fertilizer.&lt;ref name="Lawrence 1980 145"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawrence|first=James|title=The Harrowsmith Reader, Volume II|year=1980|publisher=Camden House Publishing Ltd.|isbn=0920656102|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratio of carbon to [[nitrogen]] in a plant is a crucial factor to consider, since it will impact the nutrient content of the soil and may starve a crop of nitrogen, if the incorrect plants are used to make green manure. The ratio of carbon to nitrogen will differ from species to species, and depending upon the age of the plant. The ratio is referred to as C:N. The value of N is always one, whereas the value of carbon or carbohydrates is expressed in a value of about 10 up to 90; the ratio must be less than 30:1 to prevent the manure bacteria from depleting existing nitrogen in the soil. [[Rhizobium]] are soil organisms that interact with green manure to retain atmospheric nitrogen in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawrence|first=James|title=The Harrowsmith Reader, Volume II|year=1980|publisher=Camden House Publishing Ltd.|isbn=0920656102|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Legume]]s, such as beans, alfalfa, clover and lupines, have root systems rich in rhizobium, often making them the preferred source of green manure material.

==Crops==
Late-summer and fall green manure crops are [[oat]]s and [[rye]].&lt;ref name="mofga"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association| url=http://www.mofga.org/portals/2/Fact%20Sheets/FS%2010%20Green%20Manures%20web.pdf| format=PDF| website=mofga.org|date=November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The value of green manure was recognized by farmers in India for thousands of years, as mentioned in treatises like Vrikshayurveda. In Ancient Greece too, farmers ploughed broad bean plants into the soil. Chinese agricultural texts dating back hundreds of years refer to the importance of grasses and weeds in providing nutrients for farm soil. It was also known to early North American colonists arriving from Europe. Common colonial green manure crops were rye, buckwheat and oats.&lt;ref name="Lawrence 1980 145"/&gt; Traditionally, the incorporation of green manure into the soil is known as the [[fallow]] cycle of [[crop rotation]], which was used to allow the soil to regain its fertility after the harvest.

===Drawings of real-life objects===
[[File:A Bird in Flight by Hamid Naderi Yeganeh 2016.jpg|300px|thumb|left|''[[A Bird in Flight]]'', by Hamid Naderi Yeganeh is an example of drawing real-life objects with math.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ams.org/mathimagery/displayimage.php?album=40&amp;pid=684#top_display_media|title="A Bird in Flight (2016)," by Hamid Naderi Yeganeh|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] |date=March 23, 2016 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Naderi Yeganeh has introduced two methods to draw real-life objects with mathematical formulas.&lt;ref name="articlecosmos"/&gt; In the first method, he creates tens of thousands of computer-generated mathematical figures to find a few interesting shapes accidentally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Math Is Beautiful |url= http://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/math-is-beautiful/ |date=January 19, 2016 |first=Lauren |last=Young   |work=[[Science Friday]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, by using this method, he found some shapes that resemble  birds, fishes and sailing boats.&lt;ref name="articleguardian"&gt;{{cite news |title=Catch of the day: mathematician nets weird, complex fish |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2015/feb/24/catch-of-the-day-mathematician-nets-weird-complex-fish |date= February 24, 2015 |first=Alex |last=Bellos   |work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mathematically Precise Crosshatching |url= http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/symbiartic/mathematically-precise-crosshatching/ |date=August 6, 2015 |first=Glendon |last=Mellow   |work=[[Scientific American]] (blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://plus.maths.org/content/not-bird|title=This is not a bird (or a moustache) |publisher=[[Plus Magazine]] |date= January 8, 2015|accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second method, he draws a real life object with a step-by-step process. In each step, he tries to find out which mathematical formulas will produce the drawing.&lt;ref  name="sciamblog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="articlecosmos"/&gt; For example, by using this method, he drew birds in flight, butterflies, human faces and plants using [[trigonometric functions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Drawing Birds in Flight With Mathematics |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/hamid-naderi-yeganeh/mathematical-birds_b_8876904.html |date=January 12, 2016 |first=Hamid |last=Naderi Yeganeh |work=[[Huffington Post]] (blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/mathimagery/displayimage.php?album=40&amp;pid=678#top_display_media |title="Butterfly (1)," by Hamid Naderi Yeganeh|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] |date=March 23, 2016 |accessdate=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Drawing Human Faces With Mathematics |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/hamid-naderi-yeganeh/human-faces_b_9274054.html |date=March 8, 2016 |first=Hamid |last=Naderi Yeganeh |work=[[Huffington Post]] (blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name="sciamblog"/&gt;

===Fractals and tessellations===
He has designed some fractals and tessellations inspired by the [[continents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Tax Collector |url= http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/finkel-4/ |date=April 13, 2015 |first=Gary |last=Antonick   |work=[[The New York Times]] (blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathmunch.org/2015/04/15/continents-math-explorers-club-and-i-use-math-for/|title=Continents, Math Explorers’ Club, and "I use math for…" |publisher=mathmunch.org |date=April 2015 |accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2015, he described the fractal Africa with an Africa-like octagon and its lateral inversion.&lt;ref name="articleguardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://education.lms.ac.uk/2016/08/hamid-naderi-yeganeh-fractal-africa/|title=Hamid Naderi Yeganeh: Fractal Africa |publisher=The De Morgan Forum – [[London Mathematical Society]] |date=September 21, 2016 |accessdate=October 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the [[Cadet Honor Code]]s of the [[United States Military Academy]] and [[United States Air Force Academy]], the Concept formalizes the requirement for midshipmen to demonstrate integrity while refusing to lie, cheat or steal.&lt;ref name=USNAConcept&gt;''Honor Concept'', USNA Brigade Honor Program website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Treatise adopts the use of first-person point of view, becoming a personal call to obey the letter and spirit of the Concept amongst midshipmen of the brigade.&lt;ref name=USNATreatise&gt;''Honor Treatise'', USNA Brigade Honor Program website&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Coast Guard Academy]] utilizes a similar Honor Concept to impart the same call to integrity for its corps of cadets.&lt;ref name=USCGAConcept&gt;''Honor Concept'', USCGA website, Cadet Life section&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the other service academies' honor codes, the Honor Concept allows a midshipman to confront someone committing an honor violation without formally reporting it.  At the other academies, failure to formally report an honor violation is construed as tolerating it, which is itself a violation of the code.

Penalties for violating the Honor Concept can be severe, up to and including expulsion from the Academy.

{{quote|Midshipmen are persons of integrity: We stand for that which is right.

We tell the truth and ensure that the full truth is known. We do not lie.

We embrace fairness in all actions. We ensure that work submitted as our own is our own, and that assistance received from any source is authorized and properly documented. We do not cheat.

We respect the property of others and ensure that others are able to benefit from the use of their own property. We do not steal.|Honor Concept|USNA Brigade Honor Program&lt;ref name=USNAConcept/&gt;}}

==History==
The principles of the Honor Concept are as old as the Academy itself, revolving around the principle that an officer's word is his bond.  However, examination of the past academy honor practices by 1953 USNA class president [[Ross Perot]] discovered "no uniform policy for dealing with midshipmen who had violated their class's conception of honor."&lt;ref name=Gelfand191&gt;Gelfand, ''Sea change at Annapolis'', p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; While admitting to ''irreverence'' as an "inescapable trait of midshipmen," brigade leaders like Perot, [[William P. Lawrence]] and [[James Sagerholm]] worked with Brigade Captain [[Charles Dobony]] and academy superintendent [[Harry W. Hill]] to create the Honor Concept.&lt;ref name=Gelfand192&gt;Gelfand, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Independent media''' refers to any form of [[media (communication)|media]], such as [[radio]], [[television]], [[newspaper]]s or the [[Internet]], that is free of influence by government or corporate interests. The term has varied applications. Within the [[United States]] and other [[developed country|developed countries]], it is often used synonymously with [[alternative media]] to refer to media that specifically distinguish themselves in relation to the [[mainstream media]]. In international development, the term independent media is used in relation to the development of new media outlets, particularly in areas where there is little to no existing media presence.

==Alternative media==
{{Main|Alternative media}}
In developed countries, alternative media are media that are alternatives to the business or [[state media|government-owned]] [[mass media]]. Proponents of alternative media argue that the mainstream media are [[bias]]ed. While sources of alternative media can also be biased (sometimes proudly so), the bias tends to be significantly different than that of the mainstream media, hence "alternative". As such, [[advocacy journalism]] tends to be a component of many alternative outlets. Because the term "alternative" has connotations of self-marginalization, some media outlets now prefer the term "independent" over "alternative". An independent media means that no one should control and influence its coverage of news.

==In developing countries==
In many [[developing country|developing countries]], the only media available, particularly at the national level, are government-controlled radio and television stations and newspapers. Even if not overtly controlled by the state, outlets may have strong ties to or be influenced by the government. In such situations, it is often difficult to distinguish those outlets that are truly independent from those that are influenced by the government. For example, a newspaper may provide quality, unbiased coverage of the [[economy]], [[health]], and other issues, but still avoid reporting on the government. This issue is particularly compounded by issues of [[self-censorship]], soft censorship, and other subtle government influences.

===Self-censorship===
{{Main|Self-censorship}}
Self-censorship is the act of [[censorship|censoring]] or [[classified information|classifying]] one's own work out of fear of or deference to the sensibilities of others without an authority directly pressuring one to do so. Self-censorship is often practiced by [[film producer]]s, [[film director]]s, [[publisher]]s, [[news anchor]]s, [[journalist]]s, [[musician]]s, and other kinds of [[author]]s. In [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries, creators of artworks may remove material that their government might find controversial for fear of sanction by their governments. In [[cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] [[capitalism|capitalist]] countries, self-censorship can also occur, particularly in order to conform to the expectations of the [[Market (economics)|market]]. For example, the editor of a periodical may consciously or unconsciously avoid topics that will anger [[advertiser]]s or the publication's [[parent company]] in order to protect their livelihood.

===Soft censorship===
Soft, or indirect, censorship is the practice of influencing news coverage by applying financial pressure on media companies that are deemed critical of a government or its policies and rewarding media outlets and individual journalists who are seen as friendly to the government.&lt;ref&gt;Center for International Media Assistance, ''Soft Censorship: How Governments Around the Globe Use Money to Manipulate the Media'', http://cima.ned.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/cima-soft_censorship-report.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem goes largely unnoticed, yet can have a dramatic impact on the reporting of media outlets that can otherwise be considered independent.

==Development==
{{Main|Media development}}
Many organizations engage in efforts to help the development of free and independent media in countries around the world. These efforts can take many forms, from funding the establishment of an entirely new media outlet to assisting an existing outlet in improving its [[Journalism#Professional_and_ethical_standards|professional capacity]]. Common efforts at independent media development include: journalist training and education; improving the legal environment for media; efforts to improve the sustainability of existing outlets; [[media literacy]] training; [[digital media]] training and integration; [[Infrastructure#Communications infrastructure|infrastructure]] development; and monitoring and evaluation efforts.

===Media development vs. media for development===
Some development organizations and experts make a distinction between media development and media for development. "Media development" refers to efforts to directly improve the media in a society through the means mentioned above. "Media for development" refers to more indirect efforts at using existing media to convey messages about specific development issues. Such efforts include many [[ICT4D|ICT for Development (ICT4D)]] projects. Media for development has been applied to education, healthcare, business, disaster relief, corruption, minority empowerment, and local community engagement, among other development goals.

===Media development organizations===
While development of the media sector is a common activity of many development organizations, there are a small number that engage in direct media development as their primary purpose. In the U.S., the three main media development implementers are [[Internews]], [[International Center for Journalists]] (ICFJ), and [[International Research &amp; Exchanges Board]] (IREX). In addition, organizations like the [[Center for International Media Assistance]], [[Reporters Without Borders]], [[Article 19]], and others monitor media development efforts and [[freedom of the press]] around the world.

'''Information visualization''' or '''information visualisation''' is the study of (interactive) visual representations of abstract data to reinforce human cognition. The abstract data include both numerical and non-numerical data, such as text and geographic information. However, information visualization differs from [[scientific visualization]]: "it’s infovis [information visualization] when the spatial representation is chosen, and it’s scivis [scientific visualization] when the spatial representation is given".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/imager/tr/2008/pitfalls/|title=Process and Pitfalls in Writing Information Visualization Research Papers|author=[[Tamara Munzner]]|date=|website=www.cs.ubc.ca|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|240px|Partial map of the Internet early 2005, each line represents two [[IP addresses]], and some delay between those two nodes.]]

The field of information visualization has emerged "from research in [[human-computer interaction]], [[computer science]], [[graphics]], [[visual design]], [[psychology]], and [[business methods]]. It is increasingly applied as a critical component in scientific research, [[digital libraries]], [[data mining]], financial data analysis, market studies, manufacturing [[production control]], and [[drug discovery]]".&lt;ref name = "BBB03"&gt;Benjamin B. Bederson and [[Ben Shneiderman]] (2003). [http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/pubs/books/craft.shtml ''The Craft of Information Visualization: Readings and Reflections''], Morgan Kaufmann {{ISBN|1-55860-915-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Information visualization presumes that "visual representations and interaction techniques take advantage of the human eye’s broad bandwidth pathway into the mind to allow users to see, explore, and understand large amounts of information at once. Information visualization focused on the creation of approaches for conveying abstract information in intuitive ways."&lt;ref&gt;James J. Thomas and Kristin A. Cook (Ed.) (2005). [http://nvac.pnl.gov/agenda.stm ''Illuminating the Path: The R&amp;D Agenda for Visual Analytics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929155753/http://nvac.pnl.gov/agenda.stm |date=2008-09-29 }}. National Visualization and Analytics Center. p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

Data analysis is an indispensable part of all applied research and problem solving in industry. The most fundamental data analysis approaches are visualization (histograms, scatter plots, surface plots, tree maps, parallel coordinate plots, etc.), [[statistics]] ([[hypothesis test]], [[regression analysis|regression]], [[Principal component analysis|PCA]], etc.), [[data mining]] ([[Association rule learning|association mining]], etc.), and [[machine learning]] methods ([[cluster analysis|clustering]], [[Statistical classification|classification]], [[decision trees]], etc.). Among these approaches,  information visualization, or visual data analysis, is the most reliant on the cognitive skills of human analysts, and allows the discovery of unstructured actionable insights that are limited only by human imagination and creativity. The analyst does not have to learn any sophisticated methods to be able to interpret the visualizations of the data. Information visualization is also a hypothesis generation scheme, which can be, and is typically followed by more analytical or formal analysis, such as statistical hypothesis testing.

== History ==
The modern study of visualization started with [[computer graphics]], which "has from its beginning been used to study scientific problems. However, in its early days the lack of graphics power often limited its usefulness. The recent emphasis on visualization started in 1987 with the special issue of Computer Graphics on Visualization in ''[[Scientific Computing (magazine)|Scientific Computing]]''. Since then there have been several conferences and workshops, co-sponsored by the [[IEEE Computer Society]] and [[ACM SIGGRAPH]]".&lt;ref&gt;G. Scott Owen (1999). [http://www.siggraph.org/education/materials/HyperVis/visgoals/visgoal3.htm History of Visualization]. Accessed Jan 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They have been devoted to the general topics of [[data visualisation]], information visualization and [[scientific visualisation]], and more specific areas such as [[volume visualization]].

An '''interactive movie''', also known as a '''movie game''', is a [[video game]] that presents its [[gameplay]] in a cinematic, scripted manner, often through the use of [[full-motion video]] of either [[animation|animated]] or [[live-action]] footage. In modern times,{{when?|date=July 2018}} the term also refers to games that have a larger emphasis on story/presentation than on gameplay, often used{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} in a [[pejorative]] way.

==Design==
This genre came about with the invention of [[laserdisc]]s and laserdisc players, the first [[nonlinear]] or [[random access]] video play devices. The fact that a laserdisc player could jump to and play any chapter instantaneously (rather than proceed in a linear path from start to finish like [[videotape]]) meant that games with branching plotlines could be constructed from out-of-order video chapters in much the same way as ''[[Choose Your Own Adventure]]'' books could be constructed from out-of-order pages, or the way an interactive film is constructed by choosing from a web of linked narratives.

Thus, interactive movies were animated or filmed with real actors like movies (or in some later cases, rendered with [[3D computer graphics|3D]] models), and followed a main storyline. Alternative scenes were filmed to be triggered after wrong (or alternate allowable) actions of the player (such as '[[Game Over]]' scenes).

A popular example of a commercial interactive movie was the 1983 [[arcade game]] ''[[Dragon's Lair (1983 video game)|Dragon's Lair]]'', featuring a [[full motion video]] (FMV) [[cartoon]] by ex-[[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animator [[Don Bluth]], where the player controlled some of the moves of the main character. When in danger, the player was to decide which move or action, or combination to choose. If they chose the wrong move, they would see a 'lose a life' scene, until they found the correct one which would allow them to see the rest of the story. There was only one possible successful storyline in ''Dragon's Lair''; the only activity the user had was to choose or guess the move the designers intended them to make. Despite the lack of interactivity, ''Dragon's Lair'' was very popular.

The hardware for these games consisted of a laserdisc player linked to a [[central processing unit|processor]] configured with interface software that assigned a jump-to-chapter function to each of the controller buttons at each decision point. Much as a ''Choose Your Own Adventure'' book might say "If you turn left, go to page 7. If you turn right, go to page 8", the controller for ''Dragon's Lair'' or ''[[Cliff Hanger (video game)|Cliff Hanger]]'' would be programmed to go to the next chapter in the successful story if a player pressed the right button, or to go to the death chapter if he pressed the wrong one. Because laserdisc players of the day were not robust enough to handle the constant wear placed on them by constant arcade use, they required frequent replacement. The laserdiscs that contained the footage were ordinary laserdiscs with nothing special about them save for the order of their chapters, and if removed from the arcade console would readily display their video on standard, non-interactive laserdisc players.

Later advances in technology allowed interactive movies to overlay multiple fields of FMV, called "vites", in much the same way as [[polygonal modeling|polygonal models]] and [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] are overlaid on top of backgrounds in traditional video game graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z: Vite|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first example of [[interactive cinema]] was ''[[Kinoautomat]]'' (1967), which was written and directed by [[Radúz Činčera]].  This movie was first screened at [[Expo '67]] in Montreal.  This film was produced before the invention of the laserdisc or similar technology, so a live moderator appeared on stage at certain points to ask the audience to choose between two scenes.  The chosen scene would play following an audience vote.

The first interactive movie game was [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Wild Gunman]]'', a 1974 [[Electronic game|electro-mechanical]] [[arcade game]] that used film reel projection to display live-action [[full-motion video]] (FMV) footage of Wild West gunslingers.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Therrien, [http://gamestudies.org/1502/articles/therrien Inspecting Video Game Historiography Through Critical Lens: Etymology of the First-Person Shooter Genre], ''Game Studies: The International Journal of Computer Game Research'', Volume 15, issue 2, December 2015, ISSN 1604-7982&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, Kasco (Kansei Seiki Seisakusho) released a hit electro-mechanical arcade game with live-action FMV, projecting car footage filmed by [[Toei Company|Toei]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://shmuplations.com/kasco/ Kasco and the Electro-Mechanical Golden Age] (Interview), ''Classic Videogame Station ODYSSEY'', 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

An early attempt to combine random access video with computer games was ''Rollercoaster'', written in BASIC for the Apple II by [[David Lubar]] for [[David H. Ahl]], editor of ''[[Creative Computing]]''.  This was a text adventure that could trigger a laserdisc player to play portions of the feature film ''[[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|Rollercoaster]]'' (1977).  The program was conceived and written in 1981, and published in the January 1982 issue of ''Creative Computing'', along with an article by Lubar detailing its creation, an article by Ahl claiming that ''Rollercoaster'' is the first video/computer game hybrid and proposing a theory of video/computer interactivity, and other articles reviewing hardware necessary to run the game and do further experiments.

The first arcade [[laserdisc video game]] was [[Sega]]'s ''[[Astron Belt]]'', an early [[Third-person shooter|third-person]] [[Space flight simulator game|space combat]] [[rail shooter]] featuring live-action [[Full motion video based game|full-motion video]] footage (largely borrowed from a [[Japanese science fiction]] film) over which the player/enemy ships and laser fire are superimposed.&lt;ref name="allgame"&gt;{{allgame|9550|Astron Belt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AtariHQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=ASTRON BELT|publisher=Atari HQ|url=http://www.atarihq.com/coinops/laser/astbelt.html|accessdate=2011-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed in 1982,&lt;ref name="Mark Isaacson 2002"&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Sega: From Service Games to Master Systems|author=Mark Isaacson|year=2002|url=http://www.mobygames.com/featured_article/feature,16/section,93/|accessdate=2011-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was unveiled at the 1982 AMOA show in Chicago and released the following year. However, the game that popularized the genre in the United States was ''[[Dragon's Lair (1983 video game)|Dragon's Lair]]'', animated by Don Bluth and released by [[Cinematronics]] shortly after.&lt;ref name="AtariHQ"/&gt; Around the same time, the laserdisc games ''[[Bega's Battle]]'' and ''[[Cliff Hanger (video game)|Cliff Hanger]]'' were also released.

Several laserdisc games added their own innovations to the genre. ''Bega's Battle'', released by [[Data East]] in 1983, introduced "[[Nonlinear gameplay|branching paths]]", in which there were multiple "correct moves" at certain points in the animation, and the move the player chose would affect the order of later scenes. ''[[Space Ace]]'', another Don Bluth animated game released by Cinematronics the following year, also featured a similar branching formula.&lt;ref name="Wolf-100"&gt;{{citation|title=The video game explosion: a history from PONG to Playstation and beyond|author=Mark J. P. Wolf|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2008|isbn=0-313-33868-X|page=100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XiM0ntMybNwC&amp;pg=PA100|accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, ''[[Super Don Quix-ote]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{KLOV game|9890|Super Don Quix-ote}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Esh's Aurunmilla'' and ''[[Ninja Hayate]]'' overlaid crude computer graphics on top of the animation to indicate the correct input to the player, which the 1985 games ''[[Time Gal]]'' and ''[[Road Blaster]]'' also featured.

Because ''Dragon's Lair'' and ''Space Ace'' were immensely popular, they spawned a deluge of sequels and similar laserdisc games, despite the astronomical cost of the animation. To cut costs, several companies simply hacked together scenes from [[anime]] that were obscure to American audiences of the day. One such early example was [[Stern (game company)|Stern]]'s ''[[Cliff Hanger (video game)|Cliff Hanger]]'', a 1983 game released around the same time which used footage from the ''[[Lupin III]]'' movies ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro|Castle of Cagliostro]]'' (directed by [[Hayao Miyazaki]]) and ''[[Mystery of Mamo]]''. Another example released around that time was ''Bega's Battle'', which used footage from ''[[Harmagedon (1983 film)|Harmagedon]]'', though it used a different approach, introducing a new form of video game storytelling: using brief full-motion video [[cutscene]]s to develop a story between the game's [[Shooter game|shooting]] stages. Years later, this would become the standard approach to video game storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lives and Deaths of the Interactive Movie|author=Travis Fahs|publisher=IGN|date=3 March 2008|url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/856/856379p2.html|accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bega's Battle'' also featured a branching storyline.&lt;ref name="Wolf-100"/&gt; ''[[Time Gal]]'' (1985) added a time-stopping feature, where specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time; during these moments, players are presented with a list of three options and have seven seconds to choose the one which will save the character.&lt;ref name="GP-45"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine= [[GamePro]]| publisher = Bob Huseby| title = Overseas Prospects: Time Gal| author = Captain Pachinko| issue = 45| page =138|date=April 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the game ''[[Night Trap]]'', featuring full-motion video, was created for [[Hasbro]]'s [[Control-Vision]] video game system (originally codenamed "NEMO"), which used [[VHS]] tapes. When Hasbro discontinued production of Control-Vision, the footage was placed into archive until it was purchased in 1991 by the founders of [[Digital Pictures]]. Digital Pictures ported Night Trap to the [[Sega CD]] platform, releasing it in 1992.

In 1988, [[Epyx]] announced three VCR games including one based on its video game ''[[California Games]]''. They combined videotape footage with a board game.&lt;ref name="keizer198805"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-05-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_096_1988_May#page/n9/mode/2up | title=Computer Games Go VCR; Teenage Boys Hit the Couch | work=Compute! | date=May 1988 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | author=Keizer, Gregg |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s, [[American Laser Games]] started to produce a wide variety of live-action [[light gun]] laserdisc video games, which played much like the early cartoon games, but used a light gun instead of a joystick to affect the action. Meanwhile, [[Digital Pictures]] started to produce a variety of interactive movies for [[home console]]s. When [[CD-ROM]]s were embedded in home computers, games with live action and full motion video featuring actors were considered cutting-edge, and some interactive movies were made. Some notable [[adventure game]]s from this era are ''[[Under a Killing Moon]]'', ''[[The Pandora Directive]]'', ''[[Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast Within]]'', ''[[Voyeur (video game)|Voyeur]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Klingon]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Borg]]'', ''[[Ripper (computer game)|Ripper]]'', ''[[Snatcher (video game)|Snatcher]]'', ''[[Black Dahlia (computer game)|Black Dahlia]]'', ''[[The X-Files Game]]'', ''[[Phantasmagoria (computer game)|Phantasmagoria]]'', ''[[Bad Day on the Midway]]'' and ''[[The Dark Eye (video game)|The Dark Eye]]''. Others in the [[action game|action]] genre are ''[[Brain Dead 13]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Rebel Assault]]''.

Due to the limitation of memory and disk space, as well as the lengthy timeframes and high costs required for the production, not many variations and alternative scenes for possible player moves were filmed, so the games tended not to allow much freedom and variety of gameplay. Thus, interactive movie games were not usually very replayable after being completed once.

From the time of its original introduction, the DVD format specification has included the ability to use an ordinary DVD player to play interactive games, such as ''Dragon's Lair'' (which was reissued on DVD), the ''[[Scene It?]]'' and other series of DVD games, or games that are included as bonus material on movie DVDs. Aftermath Media (founded by [[Rob Landeros]] of [[Trilobyte (company)|Trilobyte]]) released the interactive movies ''[[Tender Loving Care (video game)|Tender Loving Care]]'' and ''[[Point of View (video game)|Point of View]]'' (P.O.V) for the DVD platform.  Such games have appeared on DVDs aimed at younger target audiences, such as the special features discs of the ''[[Harry Potter (film)|Harry Potter]]'' film series.

Later video games used this approach using fully animated computer generated scenes, including various adventure games such as the ''[[Sound novel|Sound Novel]]'' series by [[Chunsoft]], ''[[Shenmue (series)|Shenmue]]'' series by Sega, ''[[Shadow of Memories]]'' by [[Konami]], ''[[Time Travelers (2012 video game)|Time Travelers]]'' by [[Level-5 (video game company)|Level 5]], and ''[[Fahrenheit (2005 video game)|Fahrenheit]]'' by [[Quantic Dream]]. During many scenes, the player has limited control of the character and chooses certain actions to progress the story. Other scenes are [[quick time event]] action sequences, requiring the player to [[Context sensitive user interface|hit appropriate buttons]] at the right time to succeed. Some of these games, such as the ''Sound Novel'' series, ''Shadow of Memories'', ''Time Travelers'', ''[[Heavy Rain]]'', ''[[Beyond: Two Souls]]'' and ''[[Detroit: Become Human]]'', have numerous branching storylines that result from what actions the player takes or fails to complete properly, which can include the death of major characters or failure to solve the mystery.  This idea was even further realized in [[Telltale Games|Telltale]]'s ''[[The Walking Dead (video game)|The Walking Dead]]'' series, where player actions can drastically change future games, for example, different characters may be alive in the end depending on choices made by the player in The Walking Dead season 1, but those same characters affect ''[[The Walking Dead: Season Two]]''.

Cast members' work during the 1990s on interactive movies' [[chroma key]] sets was different from traditional filmmaking: They performed multiple possible actions players choose in a game, usually looked into the camera to react to the player, and usually did not react to others on the set.&lt;ref name="wilson199408"&gt;{{Cite magazine

As the first CD-based consoles capable of displaying smooth and textured 3D graphics appeared, the full-FMV game had vanished from the mainstream circles around 1995, although it remained an option for PC adventure games for a couple more years. One of the last titles released was the 1998 PC and PlayStation adventure ''[[The X-Files: The Game]]'', packed in 7 CDs. That same year, ''[[Tex Murphy: Overseer]]'' became the first game developed specifically for [[DVD-ROM]], and one of the last "interactive movies" to make heavy use of live-action FMV. In 2014, the Tex Murphy series continued with a new FMV game, ''[[Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure]]''.

===LaserDisc games {{anchor|Laserdisc games}}===
A LaserDisc video game is a video game that uses pre-recorded video (either live-action or animation) played from a [[LaserDisc]], either as the entirety of the graphics, or as part of the graphics. The first arcade laserdisc game was [[Sega]]'s ''[[Astron Belt]]'', an early [[Third-person shooter|third-person]] [[Space flight simulator game|space combat]] [[rail shooter]] featuring live-action [[Full motion video based game|full-motion video]] footage (largely borrowed from a [[Japanese science fiction]] film) over which the player/enemy ships and laser fire are superimposed.&lt;ref name="allgame"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AtariHQ"/&gt; Developed in 1982,&lt;ref name="Mark Isaacson 2002"/&gt; the game's unveiling at the 1982 AMOA show in Chicago marked the beginning of LaserDisc fever in the videogame industry, and its release in Japan the following year marked the first commercial release of a LaserDisc game. However, its release in the United States was delayed due to several hardware and software bugs, by which time ''Dragon's Lair'' had beaten it to public release there.&lt;ref name="AtariHQ"/&gt;

The first LaserDisc game to gain popularity in the United States was ''Dragon's Lair'' in 1983.&lt;ref name="AtariHQ"/&gt; It contained animated scenes, much like a [[cartoon]]. The scenes would be played back and at certain points during playback the player would have to press a specific direction on the [[joystick]] or the button to advance the game to the next scene, like a [[quick time event]]. For instance, a scene begins with the hero falling through a hole in a drawbridge and being attacked by tentacles. If the player presses the button at this point, the hero fends off the tentacles with his sword, and pulls himself back up out of the hole. If the player fails to press the sword button at the right time, or instead presses a direction on the joystick, the hero is attacked by the tentacles and crushed. Each move of the joystick, however, would produce a few moments of black screen, when the graphics switched between either a successful outcome or the death of the character, which interrupted the continuous flow of gameplay found in other videogame graphic systems of the time; this was a common criticism of some players and critics.

Despite the high cost of the animation, a deluge of similar LaserDisc video games followed ''Dragon's Lair'' because of its immense popularity.  To cut costs, several companies simply hacked together scenes from several Japanese [[anime]] movies that were obscure in America at the time, creating games like ''[[Cliff Hanger (video game)|Cliff Hanger]]'' (from [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Castle of Cagliostro]]'' and from ''[[Mystery of Mamo]]'') and ''[[Bega's Battle]]'' (from ''Harmagedon''), both of which were released roughly around the same time as ''Dragon's Lair''. Later arcade LaserDisc games include ''Freedom Fighter'', ''[[Badlands (laserdisc video game)|Badlands]]'', ''[[Space Ace]]'', and ''[[Road Blaster]]''.

Other LaserDisc video games followed the lead of ''Astron Belt'' by integrating more and more computer graphics with the pre-recorded video. For example, [[Funai]]'s ''Inter Stellar'' in 1983 was a forward-scrolling [[Third-person shooter|third-person]] [[rail shooter]] that used computer graphics for the ships and full-motion video for the backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{KLOV game|8196|Interstellar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ''[[M.A.C.H. 3]]'' and ''[[Cube Quest]]'' were vertical [[scrolling shooter]]s that used the LaserDisc video for the background and computer graphics for the ships. The ''[[Firefox (arcade game)|Firefox]]'' arcade game included a Philips LaserDisc player to combine live action video and sound from the ''[[Firefox (film)|Firefox]]'' film with computer generated graphics and sound. The game used a special [[constant angular velocity|CAV]] LaserDisc containing multiple storylines stored in very short, interleaved segments on the disc. The player would seek the short distance to the next segment of a storyline during the [[vertical retrace interval]] by adjusting the tracking mirror, allowing perfectly continuous video even as the player switched storylines under control of the game's computer. This method of seeking was noted for being extremely strenuous on the player and frequently led to the machines breaking, slightly hindering the appeal of LaserDisc arcade games. In the 1990s, [[American Laser Games]] produced a wide variety of live-action [[light gun]] LaserDisc video games, which played much like the early LaserDisc games, but used a [[light gun]] instead of a joystick to affect the action.

''Bega's Battle'', released by Data East in 1983, took a different approach and introduced a new form of video game storytelling: using brief full-motion video [[cut scene]]s to develop a story between the game's shooting stages. Years later, this would become the standard approach to video game storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lives and Deaths of the Interactive Movie|author=Travis Fahs|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=3 March 2008|url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/856/856379p2.html|accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bega's Battle'' also featured a [[Nonlinear gameplay|branching storyline]].&lt;ref name="Wolf-100"/&gt;

===DVD games===
A DVD game (sometimes called '''DVDi''', "DVD interactive") is a standalone game that can be played on a set-top [[DVD player]]. The game takes advantage of technology built into the DVD format to create an interactive gaming environment compatible with most DVD players without requiring additional hardware. DVD TV games were first developed in the late 1990s. They were poorly received and understood as an entertainment medium.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}  However, DVD-based game consoles like the [[PlayStation 2]] popularized DVD-based gaming, and also functioned as a DVD video player. In addition, the format has been used to import some video games to the DVD format, allowing them to be played with a standard DVD player rather than requiring a PC. Examples include ''Dragon's Lair'' and ''[[Who Shot Johnny Rock?]]''. The [[Personal computer|PC]]/console game ''[[Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness]]'' was released in 2006 as a DVD game entitled ''[[Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Action Adventure]]''.
Japanese games such as [[visual novel]]s and [[eroge]] that were originally made for PC are commonly ported to DVDPG (a term that stands for ''DVD Players Game''). Instead of standard save methods, DVDPGs use [[password save]] systems. Similar game types include BDPG ([[Blu-ray Disc]] Players Game) and UMDPG ([[Universal Media Disc]] Players Game).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.getchu.com/dvdpg/ | title = PlayersGame(DVD-PG/UMD-PG/BD-PG) - Getchu.com | accessdate = 2013-02-18 |publisher=[[Getchu]]| language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.illusion.jp/dvdpg/dvdpg.html | title = DVD-PG（DVDPG） とは？ | trans-title = What is "DVD-PG" (DVDPG)? | accessdate = 2013-02-18 | publisher = [[Illusion (company)|Illusion]] | language = Japanese | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130313133038/http://www.illusion.jp/dvdpg/dvdpg.html | archivedate = 13 March 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blueberry-soft.com/html_hp/whatpg.htm | script-title = ja:ぶる～べり～そふと　ＤＶＤＰＧとは | trans-title = Blueberry Soft: What is DVDPG? | accessdate = 2013-02-18 | publisher = [[Blueberry Soft]] | language = Japanese | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130121133522/http://blueberry-soft.com/html_hp/whatpg.htm | archivedate = 21 January 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Live Interactive movies ===
The world's first live interactive movie was ''My One Demand''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blasttheory.co.uk/projects/my-one-demand/|title=My One Demand {{!}} Blast Theory|website=www.blasttheory.co.uk|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; filmed and premiered on 25 June 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/live-film-my-one-demand-blurs-reality-and-fiction-at-toronto-s-luminato-1.2438176|title=Live film 'My One Demand' blurs reality and fiction at Toronto's Luminato|last=Szklarski|first=Cassandra|newspaper=CTVNews|language=en-CA|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created by Blast Theory, the film was streamed live to the TIFF Lightbox&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tiff.net/|title=Toronto International Film Festival|website=www.tiff.net|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; on three successive nights.

==Reception==
Although interactive movies had a filmic quality that sprite-based games could not duplicate at the time, they were a niche market— the limited amount of direct interactivity put off many gamers.&lt;ref name="NGen10"&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Is This the End of FMV as We Know It?|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=10|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=October 1995|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of FMV games declined during 1995, as [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time 3D graphics]] gained increasing attention.&lt;ref name="NGen10op"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramshaw |first=Mark James |title=Generator|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=10|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=October 1995|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative response to FMV-based games was so common that it was even acknowledged in game marketing; a print advertisement for the interactive movie ''[[Psychic Detective (video game)|Psychic Detective]]'' stated, "Yeah, we know full-motion video games in the past sucked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Advertisement|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=12|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=December 1995|pages=136–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cost was also an issue, as live action video with decent production values is expensive to film, while video shot on a low budget damages the overall image of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Is Your Favorite Game Company Ripping You Off? |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=30|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=June 1997 |pages=38-39 |url=https://archive.org/stream/NextGeneration30Jun1997/Next_Generation_30_Jun_1997#page/n39}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ground Zero: Texas]]'' cost [[Sega]] around US$3 million, about the same as a low-budget movie would cost in 1994.

Though not as crucial an issue as the limited interactivity, another issue that drew criticism was the quality of the video itself.&lt;ref name="NGen10op"/&gt; While the video was often relatively smooth, it was not actually full-motion as it was not of 24 frames per second or higher. In addition to this, the hardware it was displayed on, particularly in the case of the [[Sega CD]], had a limited color palette (of which a maximum of 64 colors were displayable simultaneously), resulting in notably inferior image quality due to the requirement of [[Dithering#Digital photography and image processing|dithering]]. Game designer [[Chris Crawford (game designer)|Chris Crawford]] disparages the concept of interactive movies, except those aimed at elementary-school-age children, in his book ''[[Chris Crawford on Game Design]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=[[Chris Crawford on Game Design]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that since the player must process what is known and explore the options, choosing a path at a branch-point is every bit as demanding as making a decision in a conventional game, but with much less reward since the result can only be one of a small number of branches.

Defenders of the genre have argued that, by allowing the player to interact with real people rather than animated characters, interactive full-motion video can produce emotional and visceral reactions that are not possible with either movies or traditional video games.&lt;ref name="NGen10"/&gt;

==Other uses==
Some studios hybridized ordinary computer game play with interactive movie play; the earliest examples of this were the entries in the [[Origin Systems]] ''[[Wing Commander (franchise)|Wing Commander]]'' series starting with ''Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger''.  Between combat missions, ''Wing Commander III'' featured [[cut-scene]]s with live actors; the game offered limited storyline branching based on whether missions were won or lost and on choices made at decision points during the cut-scenes.

Other games like ''[[BioForge]]'' would, perhaps erroneously, use the term for a game that has rich action and plot of cinematic proportions&amp;mdash;but, in terms of gameplay, has no relation to FMV movies.

The term is an ambiguous one since many video games follow a storyline similar to the way movies would.

The '''International Center on Nonviolent Conflict''' is an independent, nonprofit educational foundation, founded by [[Jack DuVall]] and [[Peter Ackerman]]&lt;ref&gt;"Peter Ackerman - Founding Chair". International Center on Nonviolent Conflict. 2009. Archived from the original on 2010-10-12. Retrieved 2010-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002. It promotes the study and utilization of nonmilitary strategies by civilian-based movements to establish and defend [[human rights]], [[social justice]] and democracy.

==Aims==
Based in Washington, DC, ICNC works with educational institutions and [[Non-governmental organization|nongovernmental organizations]] in the United States and around the world to educate the global public and to influence policies and media coverage of the growing phenomenon of strategic nonviolent action.

==History==
The ICNC was founded by [[Peter Ackerman]] and [[Jack DuVall]] in 2002. Jack DuVall serves as ICNC’s president and Founding Director, while Peter Ackerman serves as ICNC's Founding Chair.&lt;ref&gt;"Peter Ackerman - Founding Chair". International Center on Nonviolent Conflict. 2009. Archived from the original on 2010-10-12. Retrieved 2010-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; A writer, former military intelligence officer, and former [[public television]] executive, Jack DuVall was the executive producer of a television series, "A Force More Powerful", on the television station [[PBS]] and is co-author of the companion book of the same name (Palgrave/St. Martin’s Press 2001), both of which explore major 20th century nonviolent action campaigns. Peter Ackerman, a venture capitalist who was a highly-paid associate of Michael Milken at Drexel Burham Lambert in the 1980s specializing in leveraged buyouts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1992-06-07/the-drexel-debacles-teflon-guy |title=The Drexel Debacle's Teflon Guy |last1=Bianco |first1=Anthony |publisher=Bloomberg |date=1992-06-08 |accessdate=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; received his PhD. from Tufts University’s Fletcher School for Law and Diplomacy, and  has written a series of scholarly books on strategic nonviolent action, has served on the board of Freedom House (including as chair between 2005-2009&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. Peter Ackerman Becomes New Chairman of Freedom House". Freedom House. 2005-09-08. Archived from the original on 2010-10-12. Retrieved 2010-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Freedom House Welcomes William H. Taft IV as New Chairman". Freedom House. 2009-01-08. Archived from the original on 2010-10-12. Retrieved 2010-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;) and is a member of Council on Foreign Relations.[1] In raising public awareness of the history and ideas of nonviolent conflict in both democratic and autocratic societies, ICNC has disseminated books, articles, broadcast media, video programming, computer games and other learning materials. Staff members and associated scholars have led seminars in North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East for journalists, activists, educators and NGO leaders on the history and dynamics of strategic nonviolent action.

ICNC involvement in seminars and workshops involving activists in human rights, pro-democracy and social justice campaigns overseas have led to charges from some governments of foreign intervention, though ICNC policy prohibits its presenters from giving specific advice regarding any particular struggle. Such workshops, according to ICNC policy, come only in response to specific requests from activist groups themselves and are not initiated by ICNC. ICNC also maintains a strictly apolitical posture, in that it works with groups challenging autocratic governments regardless of a given regime's ideological orientation or relations with the United States.

However, ICNC allegedly maintains connections with the "US-based 'democracy promoting' establishment groups of USAID and Reagan's National Endowment for Democracy as well as links to the CIA."&lt;ref&gt;Marty Branagan (2013). Global Warming, Militarism and Nonviolence: The Art of Active Resistance, pp. 167-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

ICNC has cooperated with other independent non-profit groups concerned with strategic nonviolent action, including the [[Albert Einstein Institution]], Nonviolence International, and the Serbian-based Center for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies (CANVAS). ICNC is funded exclusively through a private family endowment and maintains a strict policy of not accepting funding from nor collaborating with any government or government-funded entities.

Hardy Merriman who is president of the ICNC&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/about/who-we-are/&lt;/ref&gt; worked for the Albert Einstein Institution from 2002-2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://hardymerriman.com/hardy-merriman/&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Ackerman funded the Albert Einstein Institution from its founding in 1983 until 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122127204268531319/|title=American Revolutionary Quiet Boston Scholar Inspires Rebels Around the World|last1=Shishkin |first1=Philip|publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=2008-09-13 |accessdate=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged ICNC intervention in Venezuelan politics===
ICNC has been criticized for involvement in US-backed regime change operations.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Gowans (2010). "The Revolution Will Not Be Assisted By The ICNC (The Counter-Revolution Is Another Matter)." https://gowans.wordpress.com/2010/03/12/the-revolution-will-not-be-assisted-by-the-icnc-the-counter-revolution-is-another-matter/.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, American-Venezuelan lawyer Eva Golinger alleged that during 2005 and 2006, the ICNC trained Venezuelan youths to try to reverse the government of Hugo Chávez, through "[impeding] the electoral process and [creating] a scenario of fraud,"&lt;ref&gt;Golinger, Eva (2010-02-07). "Colored Revolutions: A New Form of Regime Change, Made in USA". Archived from the original on 2010-10-12. Retrieved 2010-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that the ICNC did this together with USAID and NED as part of a systemic plan of implementing United States foreign policy aims in democratic countries.&lt;ref&gt;Golinger, Eva (2010-02-07). "Colored Revolutions: A New Form of Regime Change, Made in USA". Archived from the original on 2010-10-12. Retrieved 2010-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;   ICNC denies it ever engaged in such trainings,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/38024&lt;/ref&gt; which are a violation of its charter. Jack Duvall has claimed that the only time ICNC was ever involved in Venezuela was in 2006 when it supported the travel of two nonviolent activists to the World Social Forum in Caracas, at which they met with Chavez supporters to discuss methods of resisting any possible coup attempt.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/38024&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response to Criticisms==
In response to criticisms made by Michael Barker, Stephen Zunes, who acts as the chair of the ICNC's advisory board wrote that the...

:"...ICNC does not 'work closely' with the Albert Einstein Institution, does not 'provide its theoretical underpinnings' and has never had a single operational meeting with anyone representing them. The primary connection between the two independent non-profit institutes has been ICNC's support for foreign-language translations of their literature, which have been used by nonviolent activists struggling for freedom and justice in dozens of countries." &lt;ref&gt;Stephen Zunes, [http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/38238 Inaccurate and unfair attacks on the ICNC], ''Green Left Weekly'', August 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interpretive bias''' or '''interpretation bias''' is an [[cognitive bias|information-processing bias]], the tendency to inappropriately analyze ambiguous stimuli, scenarios and events.&lt;ref name="undefined"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Mathews, A.|author2=MacLeod, C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2005|title=Cognitive vulnerability to emotional disorders|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume=1|pp=167–195|doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.1.102803.143916|pmid=17716086}}&lt;/ref&gt; One type of interpretive bias is [[hostile attribution bias]], wherein individuals perceive benign or ambiguous behaviors as hostile. For example, a situation in which one friend walks past another without acknowledgement. The individual may interpret this behavior to mean that their friend is angry with them.

==Anxiety==

It has been hypothesized that individuals with [[anxiety]] are more likely to experience interpretive bias.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Yoon, K.L.|author2=Zinbarg, R.E.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2008|title=Interpreting neutral faces as threatening is a default mode for social anxious individuals|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|volume=117|issue=3|pp=680–685|doi=10.1037/0021-843X.117.3.680|pmid=18729619|url=http://www.psychology.northwestern.edu/documents/zinbarg-faces.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study considered the interpretation of neutral facial expressions in individuals with high and low [[social anxiety]] and found that socially anxious participants perceived neutral faces as negative regardless of the context.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In contrast, the study found that non-anxious participants only showed interpretive bias in situations that created anxiety, rather than as a function of their [[personality]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Homographs==

Another studied considered how anxiety influenced which meaning of [[homograph]]s was chosen. Homographs are words with at least two meanings.&lt;ref name="undefined"/&gt; They found that anxious personalities are more likely to produce threatening interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Grey, S. J.|author2=Mathews, A.M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=Cognitive bias modification – Priming with an ambiguous homograph is necessary to detect an interpretation training effect|journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry|volume=4|issue=2|pp=338–343|doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2009.01.003|pmid=19249014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that interpretive bias depends on subsequent controlled processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Calvo, M.G.|author2=Castillo, M.D.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1996|title=Predictive inferences occur on-line, but with delay: Convergence of naming and reading times|journal=Discourse Processes|volume=22|issue=1|pp=57–78|doi=10.1080/01638539609544966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ishta-Deva''' or '''Ishta Devata''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ईष्ट देवता, ''{{IAST|iṣṭa-deva(tā)}}'', literally "cherished [[Deva (Hinduism)|divinity]]" from ''iṣṭa''
"desired, liked, cherished, preferred" and ''[[devatā]]'' "godhead, divinity, [[tutelary deity]]" or ''[[deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'' "deity") is a term denoting a worshipper's favourite deity within [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;V. S. Apte, ''A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary'', p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is especially significant to both the [[Smarta]] and [[Bhakti]] schools wherein practitioners choose to worship the form of God that inspires them. Within [[Smartism]], one of [[Ishta-Deva#Formal Smarta worship|five chief deities]] are selected. Even in denominations that focus on a singular concept of God, such as [[Vaishnavism]], the Ishta Deva concept exists. For example, in [[Vaishnavism]], special focus is given to a particular form of [[Lord Vishnu]] or one of his [[Avatar]]s (i.e. [[Krishna]] or [[Rama]]), and similarly within [[Shaktism]], focus is given to a particular form of the Goddess such as [[Parvati]] or [[Lakshmi]].  The [[Swaminarayan]] sect of Vaishnavism has a similar concept, but notably holds that Vishnu and [[Shiva]] are different aspects of the same God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swaminarayansatsang.com/library/scriptures/scriptureexplanation.asp?IDProduct%3D726%26idcategory%3D2 |accessdate=25 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317164651/http://www.swaminarayansatsang.com/library/scriptures/scriptureexplanation.asp?IDProduct=726&amp;idcategory=2 |archivedate=17 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smarta worship==
The "worship of the five forms" ({{IAST|[[pañcāyatana pūjā]]}}) system, which was popularized by philosopher [[Adi Shankara|{{IAST|Śaṅkarācārya}}]] among orthodox Brahmins of the [[Smartism|Smārta]] tradition, invokes the five deities [[Ganesha]], [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], [[Devī]], and [[Surya|Sūrya]].&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, John A. Ganapati: Song of the Self. (State University of New York Press: Albany, 1995) p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dating for the pañcāyatana pūjā and its connection with Smārta Brahmins is from p. 163, Courtright, Paul B. {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}: Lord of Obstacles, Lord of Beginnings. (Oxford University Press: New York, 1985). {{ISBN|0-19-505742-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This system was instituted by {{IAST|Śaṅkarācārya}} primarily to unite the principal deities of the five major sects ({{IAST|Gāṇapatya, Śaiva, Vaiṣṇava, Shakta and Saura}}) on an equal status.  The [[Monism|monistic]] philosophy preached by {{IAST|Śaṅkarācārya}} made it possible to choose one of these as a preferred principal deity and at the same time worship the other four deities as different forms of the same all-pervading [[Brahman]].

==Worship forms==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
[[File:Jhulelal hindu deity.jpg|x216px|right|thumb|[[Murti]] of Ishta Dev of Sindhi people [[Jhulelal (Hinduism)|Jhulelal]]]]
Typically a practitioner worships their Ishta-Deva through the form of a [[murti]]. This worship may involve offering items to their chosen divinity such as [[incense]] or flowers, reciting [[mantra]]s, [[bhajan|singing their names]] and offering [[prayer]]s.

Remembering the deity and internally building a relationship with (or through) them is considered essential to the practise. Within the [[Advaita]] schools it is believed that the [[human]] [[mind]] needs a concrete form to understand the divine that ultimately can never be defined. Just as one can understand the abstract concept of a [[color]] only after one has seen a concrete form, one can only realize the deity through a form of [[murti]]. In contrast, the [[Dvaita]] schools believe the Supreme Being to possess a divine form, and offer worship to their Ishta-Deva as either a representation or direct expansion of the Supreme Person. For example, [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] schools offer worship exclusively to murtis of Vishnu, or his associated avatars such as [[Krishna]] or [[Rama]].

[[Shaivism|Shaivites]] worship Shiva, either figuratively, or through his [[Lingam]] murti. As Shaivism contains both monistic and dualistic traditions either (or both) of the above approaches may be applicable.

'''Legislative violence''' broadly refers to any [[violence|violent]] clashes between members of a [[legislature]], often physically, inside the legislature and triggered by divisive issues and tight votes. Such clashes have occurred in many countries across time, and notable incidents still regularly occur.

Although the sight of brawling politicians is incongruous with a legislature's stately image, its occupants, like in any other workplace, are still prone to [[stress (biology)|stress]] and [[anger]]. The confrontational nature of politics, regardless of their location, and the high stakes involved often add to the simmering tensions.&lt;ref name="bbc 2004"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3560977.stm "When politicians attack..."], [[BBC News]], March 23, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

All that is needed is an excuse, and that is too often found.}}

[[File:Vincenzo Camuccini - La morte di Cesare.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|''Morte de Césare'' (Death of Caesar) by [[Vincenzo Camuccini]]]]
Roman general and [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Julius Caesar]] was famously [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]] by a group of senators on the [[Ides of March]], 44 BC during a meeting of the [[Roman Senate]]. The senators, led by [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] and [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and calling themselves [[Liberatores]], had conspired in secret to kill Caesar and considered various ways to do so. Ultimately, they decided to kill him during a meeting of the senate, since only senators would be allowed in the meeting and Caesar would be alone. The senators drafted a fake petition requesting that Caesar hand over power to senate; Caesar called a meeting of the senate to read it. When Caesar met the senators at the [[Theatre of Pompey]], they stabbed him repeatedly with daggers concealed under their [[toga]]s, killing him. Caesar's assassination led to a [[civil war]] for control of the [[Roman Republic|republic]], ending ultimately with the rise of [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]] and the founding of the [[Roman Empire]].

In January 1988, there was a riot in the [[Tamil Nadu]] state legislative assembly over a vote of majority for [[Janaki Ramachandran]], who was serving as [[Chief Minister (India)|Chief Minister]] following the death in December 1987 of her husband [[MGR]]. The [[ADMK]] party had split, with most [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLAs]] supporting her and some supporting [[Jayalalithaa]]'s bid to become Chief Minister instead. The [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] party with its 60 MLAs was able to play "kingmaker".&lt;ref name="businessline"&gt;[http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/rasheeda-bhagat/pepper-spray-pales-against-past-tn-assembly-events/article5690057.ece Both riots]&lt;/ref&gt; While the Congress-led Central Government in New Delhi ordered them to vote against Janaki, some Congress MLAs chose to resign instead, allowing the Janaki government to survive the majority vote. A riot ensued in the legislature, with members clubbing each other with microphone stands and footwear, which was finally ended by riot police who stormed the legislature and beat up everybody with their batons.&lt;ref name="businessline" /&gt; The Janaki faction was however dismissed by the Central Government under [[Article 356]] of the Indian Constitution, having survived just 24 days in office. The state was placed under [[President's rule]] for a year, until the next scheduled state assembly elections in January 1989.

During a dispute over the conduct of British soldiers on [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] on the day before, Independent Socialist MP [[Bernadette Devlin]] punched the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Home Secretary [[Reginald Maudling]]. Her aggression was in response to the comments made by Maudling, who was maintaining that the British Army had fired at Bloody Sunday protesters in self-defence, contrary to the testimonies of civilian eyewitnesses (including Devlin herself). She argued that she was being denied the right to speak. Her actions resulted in her being banned from the House of Commons for six months.

[[File:Lyon-griswold-brawl.jpg|thumb|''Congressional Pugilists'', a 1798 political cartoon depicting the fight between Griswold and Lyon.]]
Federalist Congressman [[Roger Griswold]] of [[Connecticut]] attacked [[Vermont]] Representative [[Matthew Lyon]] with a [[hickory]] walking stick in the chambers of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Griswold struck Lyon repeatedly about the head, shoulders and arms, while Lyon attempted to shield himself from the blows. Lyon then turned and ran to the fireplace, took up a pair of metal tongs, and having armed himself thus returned to the engagement. Griswold then tripped Lyon and struck him in the face while he lay on the ground, at which point the two were separated. After a break of several minutes, however, Lyon unexpectedly pursued Griswold again with the tongs, and the brawl was re-ignited.

The two men had a prior history of conflict. On January 30 of that year, Griswold had publicly insulted Lyon by calling him a coward, and Lyon had retaliated by spitting in Griswold's face. As a result of Lyon's actions in that case, he became the first Congressman to have charges filed against him with that body's ethics committee, although he escaped censure through a vote in the House.

Congressman [[Preston Brooks]] of [[South Carolina]] famously assaulted [[Charles Sumner]] of [[Massachusetts]] for a previous speech of his, saying his uncle [[Andrew Butler]] took "a mistress who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight—I mean, the harlot, Slavery."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Brooks (accompanied by Keitt), approached and confronted Sumner as he sat writing at his desk in the almost empty Senate chamber. As Sumner began to stand up, Brooks began beating Sumner severely on the head with a thick [[gutta-percha]] cane with a gold head before he could reach his feet. Sumner was knocked down and trapped under the heavy desk (which was bolted to the floor), but Brooks continued to bash Sumner until he ripped the desk from the floor. By this time, Sumner was blinded by his own blood, and he staggered up the aisle and collapsed, lapsing into unconsciousness. Brooks continued to beat the motionless Sumner until he broke his cane, then quietly left the chamber. Several other senators attempted to help Sumner, but were blocked by Keitt, who had jumped into the aisle, brandishing a pistol and shouting, "Let them be!"&lt;ref&gt;Donald, David Herbert ''Charles Sumner and the Coming Civil War'' New York: Alfred A.

Congressman Laurence Keitt of South Carolina was involved in another incident of legislative violence less than two years later, starting a massive brawl on the House floor during a tense late-night debate. Keitt became offended when [[Pennsylvania]] Congressman (and later [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]) [[Galusha A. Grow]] stepped over to the Democratic side of the House chamber while delivering an anti-slavery speech. Keitt dismissively interrupted Grow's speech to demand he sit down, calling him a "black [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] puppy". Grow indignantly responded by telling Keitt that “No negro-driver shall crack his whip over me.” Keitt became enraged and went for Grow's throat, shouting that he would "choke him for that". A large brawl involving approximately 50 representatives erupted on the House floor, ending only when a missed punch from Rep. [[Cadwallader Washburn]] of [[Wisconsin]] upended the [[hairpiece]] of Rep. [[William Barksdale]] of [[Mississippi]]. The embarrassed Barksdale accidentally replaced the wig backwards, causing both sides to erupt in spontaneous laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Filibuster | author=Allan L.

During an anti-slavery speech by Illinois Republican [[Owen Lovejoy]] on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on April 5, 1860, Lovejoy condemned the Democratic Party for its racist views and steadfast support of slavery. As Lovejoy gave his speech condemning the evils of slavery, several of the Democrats present in the audience, such as [[Roger Atkinson Pryor]], grew irate and incensed over Lovejoy's anti-slavery remarks and threatened him with physical harm, brandishing pistols and canes, with several Republicans rushing to Lovejoy's defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMEv8DNXVbIC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=%22The+principle+of+enslaving+human+beings+because+they+are+inferior%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YA6W9JoaPr&amp;sig=aO15r4OJEVD8bQUIjM34u42GjXg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiM9vuXwsrLAhWJeD4KHWvpAUcQ6AEIHjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20principle%20of%20enslaving%20human%20beings%20because%20they%20are%20inferior%22&amp;f=false|title=His Brother's Blood: Speeches and Writings, 1838–64|first1=Owen|last1=Lovejoy|first2=William Frederick|last2=Moore|first3=Jane Ann|last3=Moore|first4=Paul|last4=Simon|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Illinois|chapter=Debate on Slavery, Conducted under Hostile Conditions in Congress, April 5, 1860|pages=191–200|isbn=0-252-02919-4|date=2004|accessdate=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 24 February 1887 ===
The [[Indiana General Assembly]] experienced [[Black Day of the Indiana General Assembly|a massive brawl]] between Democrats and Republicans in the [[Indiana Senate]] and [[Indiana House of Representatives]]. The event began as an attempt by Democratic Governor [[Isaac P. Gray]] to be elected to the United States Senate and his own party’s attempt to thwart him. Gray was a former Republican who had been elected Governor by popular vote but was scorned as a turncoat by his new party, who maneuvered desperately (and unsuccessfully) to try to prevent his eligibility for the Senate seat. When Gray went over the head of the Democrats in arranging a [[midterm election]] for a new Lieutenant Governor, Republican Robert S. Robertson was elected with a majority of the popular vote, a situation the Democrats refused to accept despite a ruling from the [[Indiana Supreme Court]]. The matter came to a head when Robertson attempted to enter the Senate chamber to be sworn in and take his seat presiding over the session; he was attacked, beaten, and thrown bodily from the chamber by the Democrats, who then locked the chamber door, beginning four hours of intermittent mass brawling that spread throughout the [[Indiana Statehouse]]. The fight ended only after Republicans and Democrats began brandishing pistols and threatening to kill each other and the Governor was forced to deploy the [[Indianapolis Police Department]] to restore order. Subsequently, the Republican controlled House of Representatives refused to communicate with the Democratic Senate, ending the legislative session and leading to calls for United States Senators to be [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|elected by popular vote]].

=== 20 February 1902 ===
During a debate on a bill dealing with the [[Philippines|Philippine Islands]], Senator [[Benjamin Tillman]] of [[South Carolina]] accused Senator [[John L. McLaurin]] of South Carolina of "treachery" for siding with the Republicans in support of Philippine annexation, and alleged that McLaurin had been granted control of government patronage in South Carolina. Upon receiving word of this statement, McLaurin entered the Senate Chamber and denounced Tillman, upon which Tillman attacked him. During the fight, other senators were hit by the punches. As a result, the Senate went into closed session to debate the matter. Both senators apologized to the Senate, but almost came to blows immediately thereafter. On February 28, the Senate voted 54 to 12, with 22 abstentions, to [[Censure]] both Tillman and McLaurin. McLaurin did not seek reelection, while Tillman served in the Senate until 1918.

=== 4 March 1985 ===
On the House of Representatives chamber floor, Democrat [[Thomas Downey]] of New York confronted [[Robert Dornan]], a California Republican, and Dornan grabbed Downey's tie in response. Downey approached Dornan in response to a speech Downey had given two days earlier before the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]], in which he called Downey a "[[Draft evasion|draft-dodging]] wimp" because of Downey's repeated denouncement of US-backed antigovernment [[Contras]] rebels in [[Nicaragua]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], Downey received a medical deferment from the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] because of a [[perforated eardrum]]. Downey had also been active in protesting the war. The Dornan-Downey beef originated two years earlier, when Downey spoke against Dornan's nomination for a position at the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/03/06/duel-on-the-hill/a66a3746-68c3-471a-8314-c9a30390dd46/|title=Duel on the Hill|last=Romano|first=Lois|date=1985-03-06|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Downey speech was made on Saturday, 2 March. On Monday afternoon, 4 March, Downey confronted Dornan, attracting dozens of viewers. Dornan claims Downey grabbed him by the shoulder and turned him around, asking if he had actually called him a wimp. Dornan answered "I did and you are." The exchange became heated, and at some point Dornan accused Downey of having cost him the job two years earlier. According to Downey, as he began to walk away, Dornan grabbed him by the tie and collar and threatened him with "bodily harm." Dornan claimed he was just straightening Downey's tie knot, saying later, "I like all the members to look elegant on the floor, you know." Dornan, according to himself and other witnesses, then told Downey to "get out of my face." After, Downey went to the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Tip O'Neill]] to tell him what had happened.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After the incident, Downey released a statement and stated through a spokesman that he would not speak to reporters "until Dornan apologizes." His spokesman also said that Downey was considering filing a complaint with the [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States House of Representatives|House Sergeant at Arms]]. Several witnesses spoke about the incident. Democratic Congressman [[Mike Lowry]] said, "Dornan grabbed Downey roughly by the collar, and I mean aggressively. None of this straighten-the-tie baloney. And he told Downey, 'Don't let me catch you off the floor, where you are protected by the sergeant at arms.' I really think Downey restrained himself." Republican Representative [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] of New Jersey, who witnessed the altercation, said, "I found it humorous that Downey had to run up to the Speaker when it was over to tell all. It was like a little classroom act . . . Very childish . . . I think he's made much to-do about nothing."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The day after the incident, House Speaker Tip O'Neill condemned the behavior, and said he told Dornan, "You can settle it on the street, but don't settle it on the House floor." He also told reporters that "discipline" would ensue if "anything like that" happened again. That day, Downey stated again, "Congressman Dornan owes me and the House of Representatives an apology." Dornan responded, "Apologize for what? For calling him a wimp? I am willing to concede that perhaps he just walks, talks and acts like a little arrogant wimp. But maybe it's disinformation. Maybe he really wears a black leather jacket by night that I don't know about."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[aerodynamics]], the '''lift-to-drag ratio''', or '''L/D ratio''', is the amount of [[Lift (force)|lift]] generated by a [[wing]] or vehicle, divided by the [[aerodynamic drag]] it creates by moving through the air. A higher or more favorable L/D ratio is typically one of the major goals in aircraft design; since a particular aircraft's required lift is set by its weight, delivering that lift with lower drag leads directly to better [[fuel economy in aircraft]], climb performance, and [[glide ratio]].

The term is calculated for any particular [[airspeed]] by measuring the lift generated, then dividing by the drag at that speed. These vary with speed, so the results are typically plotted on a 2D graph. In almost all cases the graph forms a U-shape, due to the two main components of drag.

Lift-to-drag ratios can be determined by flight test, by [[computational fluid dynamics|calculation]] or by testing in a wind tunnel.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Drag==
[[Lift-induced drag]] is a component of [[Drag (aerodynamics)|total drag]] that arises whenever a finite span wing generates lift. At low speeds an aircraft has to generate lift with a higher [[angle of attack]], thereby leading to greater induced drag. This term dominates the low-speed side of the lift versus velocity graph.
[[File:Drag curves for aircraft in flight.svg|thumb|The drag curve]]
[[File:DargPolarAL.png|thumb|350px|right|Drag polar for light aircraft. The tangent gives the maximum {{math|L/D}} point.]]
[[Form drag]] is caused by movement of the aircraft through the air. This type of drag, also known as [[air resistance]] or [[profile drag]] varies with the square of speed (see [[drag equation]]). For this reason profile drag is more pronounced at higher speeds, forming the right side of the lift/velocity graph's U shape. Profile drag is lowered primarily by streamlining and reducing cross section.

Lift, like drag, increases as the square of the velocity and the ratio of lift to drag is often plotted in terms of the [[lift coefficient|lift]] and [[drag coefficient]]s C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;. Such graphs are referred to as [[drag polar]]s. Speed increases from left to right.  The lift/drag ratio is given by the slope from the origin to some point on this curve and so the peak L/D ratio does not occur at the point of least drag, the leftmost point. Instead it occurs at a slightly higher speed.  Designers will typically select a wing design which produces an L/D peak at the chosen [[cruising speed]] for a powered fixed-wing aircraft, thereby maximizing economy. Like all things in [[aeronautical engineering]], the lift-to-drag ratio is not the only consideration for wing design. Performance at high angle of attack and a gentle [[Stall (flight)|stall]] are also important.

==Glide ratio==
As the aircraft [[fuselage]] and control surfaces will also add drag and possibly some lift, it is fair to consider the L/D of the aircraft as a whole. As it turns out, the [[Gliding (flight)#Glide ratio|glide ratio]], which is the ratio of an (unpowered) aircraft's forward motion to its descent, is (when flown at constant speed) numerically equal to the aircraft's L/D. This is especially of interest in the design and operation of high performance [[sailplane]]s, which can have glide ratios approaching 60 to 1 (60 units of distance forward for each unit of descent) in the best cases, but with 30:1 being considered good performance for general recreational use. Achieving a glider's best L/D in practice requires precise control of airspeed and smooth and restrained operation of the controls to reduce drag from deflected control surfaces. In zero wind conditions, L/D will equal distance traveled divided by altitude lost. Achieving the maximum distance for altitude lost in wind conditions requires further modification of the best airspeed, as does alternating cruising and thermaling.  To achieve high speed across country, glider pilots anticipating strong thermals often load their gliders (sailplanes) with [[Gliding competitions#Water ballast|water ballast]]: the increased [[wing loading]] means optimum glide ratio at higher airspeed, but at the cost of climbing more slowly in thermals.  As noted below, the maximum L/D is not dependent on weight or wing loading, but with higher wing loading the maximum L/D occurs at a faster airspeed.  Also, the faster airspeed means the aircraft will fly at higher [[Reynolds number]] and this will usually bring about a lower [[zero-lift drag coefficient]].

==Theory==
Mathematically, the maximum lift-to-drag ratio can be estimated as:

:&lt;math&gt;(L/D)_{max} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi \epsilon AR}{C_{D,0}}}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Loftin, LK, Jr.|title=Quest for performance: The evolution of modern aircraft. NASA SP-468|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-468/cover.htm|accessdate=2006-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where ''AR'' is the [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]], &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; the [[span efficiency factor]], a number less than but close to unity for long, straight edged wings, and &lt;math&gt;C_{D,0}&lt;/math&gt; the [[zero-lift drag coefficient]].

Most importantly, the maximum lift-to-drag ratio is independent of the weight of the aircraft, the area of the wing, or the wing loading.

It can be shown that two main drivers of maximum lift-to-drag ratio for a fixed wing aircraft are wingspan and total wetted area. One method for estimating the zero-lift drag coefficient of an aircraft is the equivalent skin-friction method. For a well designed aircraft, zero-lift drag (or parasite drag) is mostly made up of skin friction drag plus a small percentage of pressure drag caused by flow separation. The method uses the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;C_{D,0}=C_{fe}\frac{S_{wet}}{S_{ref}}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raymer|first1=Daniel|title=Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach|date=2012|publisher=AIAA|location=New York|edition=5th|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C_{fe}&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent skin friction coefficient, &lt;math&gt;S_{wet}&lt;/math&gt; is the wetted area and &lt;math&gt;S_{ref}&lt;/math&gt; is the wing reference area. The equivalent skin friction coefficient accounts for both separation drag and skin friction drag and is a fairly consistent value for aircraft types of the same class. Substituting this into the equation for maximum lift-to-drag ratio, along with the equation for aspect ratio (&lt;math&gt;b^2/S_{ref}&lt;/math&gt;), yields the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;(L/D)_{max}=\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi \epsilon}{C_{fe}}\frac{b^2}{S_{wet}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''b'' is wingspan. The term &lt;math&gt;b^2/S_{wet}&lt;/math&gt; is known as the wetted aspect ratio. The equation demonstrates the importance of wetted aspect ratio in achieving an aerodynamically efficient design.

==Supersonic/hypersonic lift to drag ratios==
At very high speeds, lift to drag ratios tend to be lower. [[Concorde]] had a lift/drag ratio of around 7 at Mach 2, whereas a 747 is around 17 at about mach 0.85.

[[Dietrich Küchemann]] developed an empirical relationship for predicting L/D ratio for high Mach:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerospaceweb.org/design/waverider/design.shtml Aerospaceweb.org Hypersonic Vehicle Design]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L/D_{max}=\frac{4(M+3)}{M}&lt;/math&gt;

where M is the Mach number. Windtunnel tests have shown this to be roughly accurate.

He became disciple of Buddha and  is one of the five hundred Arahants who will be born as future [[Buddha]]s, according to the [[Buddhist]] beliefs. The reference to Kapphina is found in  the Jatakas, ''Manorathapurani'', the commentary on [[Dhammapada]],&lt;ref&gt;Book VI. The Wise man, Pandita Vagga, 4=79.&lt;/ref&gt; Visuddh magga, Samyutta Saratthappakasini Commentary, Simuutta Nikaya, [[Anguttara Nikaya]], Vinaya Pitaka,  Theragāthā, Theragāthā Commentary etc., as well as in  the [[Sanskrit]] ''Avadanashatika''.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Savants of Kashmir, 1987, p 87, Advaitavadini Kaul.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Kapphina was born in a city called Kukkata (Kukkutavati according to some accounts) in a [[Monarchy|kingdom]], three hundred yojanas in extent.&lt;ref&gt;See: Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, pp 614, 613, and see also p 473, G. P. Malalasekera.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to G. P. Malalasekera, Kukkuta was probably the name of the kingdom and Kukkatavati that of its capital (See: Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, pp 614, G. P. Malalasekera).&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[frontier]] kingdom,&lt;ref name="Pali Proper Names 2003, p 473"&gt;Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, p 473, G. P. Malalasekera.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A History of Pāli Literature, 2000, p 497, B. C. Law.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Northern India According to the Shui-ching-chu, 1950, p 66, Luciano Petech, Daoyuan Li.&lt;/ref&gt; located near Himavanta or ''[[Himalaya]]''&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, p 613, G. P. Malalasekera.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Himalaya of the ancient texts and traditions extended from eastern ocean to western ocean and, thus included Hindukush and Karakoram ranges as well (Ref: Sumangavilasini,I.1; Geographical Data in Early Puranas, 1972, p 65).&lt;/ref&gt; and was ruled by his father on whose death, he became its ruler under the name  Maha Kapphina—Kapphina or Kappina being probably his appellative rather than a given name. His chief queen ''Anoja'' was a [[princess]] from ''Sagala'' of the [[Madra]] kingdom.
Soon after ascending the throne, Kappina got attracted towards [[Buddhism]] through the medium of traders from Savatthi (Sarasvati in eastern [[Uttar Pradesh|UP]])&lt;ref&gt;Ancient capital of Kosala.&lt;/ref&gt; who had visited Kukkatavati and told him about of the appearance in the world of Buddha, the Law, and the Sangha. Immediately on hearing this news, King Maha Kapphina and his thousand courtiers and [[Queen Anoja]] and her thousand ladies-in-waiting had given splendid gifts and set out to visit and see the Buddha in person. In this manner they crossed three rivers on dry foot: the Aravacchā, the Nilavāhana, and the Chandrabhaga on making Acts of Truth. The Buddha perceived them coming with his divine eye, and after he had eaten at Savatthi, went through the air to the banks of river Chandrabhaga ([[Chenab]]) and sat down under the great [[banyan]] tree facing the landing stage of the river. Maha Kapphina and his men saw the Buddha and prostrated themselves before him. The Buddha taught them the Doctrine and they all retired from the world, became arahants and joined the Order. Maha Kapphina exclaims wherever he goes:  ''"aho sukham!, aho sukham"!!'' (''Oh happiness!'', ''Oh happiness!!''!).  The [[monk]]s conclude that Kapphina has in mind the happiness of ruling. The Buddha informs that Kapphina refers to the happiness of Nibhana.&lt;ref&gt;Book VI, Pandita Vagga, The Wiseman, 4=79; [[Harvard Oriental Series]], 1921, p 101, Harvard University - Sanskrit literature.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, p 474, G. P. Malalasekera.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Country of origin==
Nothing definite is known about Maha Kapphina. He is mentioned both in the [[Buddhist]]&lt;ref&gt;''Manorathapurani'' and in the commentary on [[Dhammapada]] (Book VI. The Wise man, Pandita Vagga, 4=79) etc.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[Sanskrit]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;Kapphinabhuyudaya in Avadanashatika by Sivaswami, XVIII.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="All-India Oriental Conference 1933, p 117"&gt;Proceedings and Transactions of the All-India Oriental Conference, 1933, p 117, All-India Oriental Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indian Linguistics 1966, p 499"&gt;Indian Linguistics, 1966, p 499,  Linguistic Society of India.&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhist literature, he is stated to be king of Kukkatavati located  beyond river [[Indus]] either in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]] (NWFP) of Pakistan, in North-east [[Afghanistan]]&lt;ref name="AC"/&gt; or in [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;Śivasvāmin's Kapphiṇābhyudaya, or, Exaltation of King Kapphiṇa: or, Exaltation of King Kapphiṇa, 1989, Gauri Shankar, Michael Hahn; Proceedings and Transactions of the All-India Oriental Conference, 1933, p 118, All-India Oriental Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; But Medieval age Buddhist writer Śivasvāmin, the court poet of Avantivarman (855 AD - 883 AD), in his poetical composition (Avadanashatika) refers to Maha Kapphina as the king of ''Lilavati'', the lord of [[Vindhya]] as well as king of ''Daksinatya'' etc.&lt;ref&gt;Kapphinabhuyudaya in Avadanashatika by Sivaswami, XVIII.104; XX.1;  Cf: Indian Kavya Literature, 1988, p 175,  A. K. Warder; Cf: A History of Indian Literature, 500-1399: From Courtly to the Popular, 2005, p 81,  Sisir Kumar Das.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Śivasvāmin is a very belated author (9th century AD), the scholar community does not give much credence to his version of Maha Kapphina legend compared to that from the ancient Buddhist texts.

The internal evidence of Kapphina legend  tends to locate Kukkatavati somewhere near Pukkhlavati or Mashkavati in NWFP.  It is notable that several similar ending names such as ''Utpalavati, Hamsavati, Oghavati (Apaga), Pokkharavatī'' ([[Sanskrit]] ''Pushkavati'') and [[Pāṇini]]an ''Mashkavati'' (i.e. Massaga of [[Arrian]]) are documented in the NWFP.

[[Divyavadana]] attests a city called Utpalavati located in Uttarapatha.&lt;ref&gt;Divyavadana, p 470; Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, p 363, G. P. Malalasekera.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient name of Sanskrit Pushkalavati, Pali Pokkharavati or Pushkaravati is said to have been Utpalavati&lt;ref&gt;The geographical dictionary of ancient and mediaeval India, 1979, pp  163, 200, Nundo Lal Dey;  India as Described in Early Texts of Buddhism and Jainism, 1980, p 87, B. C. Law; A History of Indian Civilization, 1958, pp 62, 462,  Radhakamal Mukerjee;  Foreign Influence on Ancient India, 1992, p 309, Krishna Chandra Sagar; Gandhara and Its Art Tradition, 1978, p 15,  Ajit Ghose; Buddhist Remains in Afghanistan, 1991, p 25,  R. B. Narain - Buddhism; The Society of the Ramayana, 1991, p 79,  Ananda W. P. Guruge; The Sanskrit Buddhist Literature of Nepal, 1882, p 316,  Rājendralāla Mitra, Asiatic Society (Calcutta, India). Library, Asiatic Society of Bengal, Asiatic Society of Bengal Oriental Library;  History of Buddhism in Afghanistan, 1990, p 207, Buddhism; Bhāratī: Bulletin of the College of Indology, 1983, p 92, Banaras Hindu University College of Indology, Banaras Hindu University Dept. of Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology.&lt;/ref&gt; and was located above the confluence of [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]] and [[Kabul]] river, modern Charasadda. The story of Rupavati (''Rupavatyavadana'') specifically equates this ''Utpalavati'' to  the ''Pushkalavati'' (modern [[Charasaddha]], north of [[Peshawar]]). Thus, it has been conjectured that city of Kukkatavati may have been in NWFP of Pakistan or somewhere near Pushkalavati or Mashkavati (Massaga), or in north-east [[Afghanistan]], in the land of [[Ashvaka]] [[Kambojas]]. The marriage of king Kapphina to Anoja, the princess  of Madda ([[Madra]]) kingdom also points to this direction.

==Kapphina related to Kapin/Kipin/Kophene (Kabul/Kapisa or Kamboja)==
It has been suggested that the very name Kapphina or Kappina may be related to [[China|Chinese]] ''Kipin or Kapin or  [[greece|Greek]] Kophene''. Kipin of Chinese is the same as Kophene of the Greek writings and  the Kubha  and/or Kapisa of the [[Sanskrit]] literature.&lt;ref name="All-India Oriental Conference 1933, p 117"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Indian Linguistics 1966, p 499"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Śivasvāmin's Kapphiṇābhyudaya, or, Exaltation of King Kapphiṇa: or, Exaltation of King Kapphiṇa, 1989,  Gauri Shankar, Michael Hahn; Northern India According to the Shui-ching-chu, 1950, p 66-67, Luciano Petech, Daoyuan Li.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ancient Geography of India: By Alexander Cunningham. New Enl. Ed. / Foreword by B. Ch. Chhabra ; Introd. by Asim Kumar Chatterjee ; Additional Notes by Jamna Das Akhtar, 1975, p xxvii, Alexander Cunningham.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pāṇini]] teaches that  the name of the Kamboja king could be same as the name of his kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Ashtadhyayi IV.1.175.&lt;/ref&gt;  It therefore looks quite probable that name Kapphina was not a proper name but an appellation of its ruler and likewise may be related to name Kipin, Kapin and Kophene which are the [[China|Chinese]] and the [[Greek language|Greek]] versions of the Sanskrit Kubha (Kabul) and [[Kingdom of Kapisa|Kapisa]] respectively.  Equivalence of [[Kabul]] and  Kapisa with Kamboja has also been accepted by scholar community.&lt;ref&gt;For Kabul = Kamboj equivalence, see refs: Ethnologische Forschungen und Sammlung von Material für dieselben, 1871, p 244, Adolf Bastian – Ethnology; The People of India: A Series of Photographic Illustrations, with Descriptive Letterpress, of the Races and Tribes of Hindustan, Originally Prepared Under the Authority of the Government of India, and Reproduced by Order of the Secretary of State for India in Council, 1868, p 155, John William Kaye, Meadows Taylor, Great Britain India Office – Ethnology; Supplementary Glossary, p. 304, H.

[[Alexander Cunningham]] writes: ''"Kipin is one of the most famous but also most puzzling terms of the Chinese geography of north-western India (now Pakistan). As a geographical term the word 'Kipin' is not to be found in Indian literature. We come acrorss King Maha Kapphina or Maha Kaphina, the hero of the many [[Buddhist]] legends. He is described as ruling in Kukutavati, a frontier region and this region is definitely localized in the extreme north-west of India (now Pakistan).  According to Buddhist traditions, Kaphina was a [[Brahman]]. He met the [[Buddha]] during the latter's journey to the north-west. Kukatagiri, as mentioned by [[Pāṇini]] (V. 4. 147) seems to represent some low peaks of [[Hindukush]] in [[Afghanistan]]. Thus, Kipin or Kukutawati was situated in Afghanistan near the borders of Pakistan. It is probably Huphina of [[Hiuen Tsang]] or Huppian which is Kophen (=the kingdom of Kabul). King Kapphina of the Buddhist legends was the king of this region"''.&lt;ref name="AC"&gt;The Ancient Geography of India: 1975, p xxvii, Alexander Cunningham.&lt;/ref&gt;

King Maha Kapphina was, in all probability a powerful ruler whose kingdom besides Kabul (Kophene), probably also included parts of [[Gandhara]]. Kipin described in the Hou Han-shu may represent the region NWFP (now in Pakistan) dominated in turn by the [[Greeks]],  the [[Sakas]],  the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] and the [[Kushana]]s''.&lt;ref name="AC"/&gt;

Maha Kapphina is said to have met Buddha after crossing three northern rivers&lt;ref name="Pali Proper Names 2003, p 473"/&gt;  i.e. river Aravacchā (probably ''Swat?''), the Nīlavāhana and the Chandrabhaga.  This shows that he must have come from north/north-west as river Chandrabhaga is identified with  river [[Chenab]] and Nīlavāhana with river [[Indus]] (Nilab).

According to scholars like D. D. Kosambi, Kapphina was of a [[Kshatriya]] varna&lt;ref&gt;The Culture and Civilization of Ancient India in Historical Outline,  2000, p 120; Ancient India: A History of Its Culture and Civilization, 1965, Damodar Dharmanand Kosambi.&lt;/ref&gt; but according to Alexander Cunningham, Kapphina was of a [[Brahman]] varna.&lt;ref&gt;The Ancient Geography of India: By Alexander Cunningham. New Enl. Ed. / Foreword by B. Ch. Chhabra; Introd. by Asim Kumar Chatterjee ; Additional Notes by Jamna Das Akhtar, 1975, p xxvii, Alexander Cunningham.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ānanda: Papers on Buddhism and Indology: a Felicitation Volume Presented to Ananda Weihena Palliya Guruge on His Sixtieth Birthday, 1990, p 175, Ananda W. P. Guruge, [[Y Karunadasa]] - Buddhism.&lt;/ref&gt; But these conflicting views are least problematic here since Kambojas in ancient times  were given to both [[Kshatrya]] as well as [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanical]] pursuits. Pali texts' legend of Maha Kapphina however, does not specify anywhere that Kapphina was a Brahmin or a Kshatriya.&lt;ref&gt;See: Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, p 473 seq, G. P. Malalasekera.&lt;/ref&gt; But internal evidence of Kapphina legend points to his belonging to the Kshatriya varna.

Maha Kapphina is described by Buddha as pale (or white) (''? odata''), thin and having a characteristic thin and prominent nose (''tanukam tunganasikam'').&lt;ref&gt;Jataka ii. 284; Kindered Sayings II, pp 193-94; Proceedings and Transactions of the All-India Oriental Conference, Item notes: 7th 1933, p 118, Published by Bihar and Orissa Research Society; The Culture and Civilization of Ancient India in Historical Outline,  2000, p 120, D. D. Kosambi; Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, p 475, G. P. Malalasekera.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the personal features, especially the [[Aryan]] nose also resemble that of a man from the North/north-west&lt;ref&gt;Indian Linguistics, 1966, p 499,  Linguistic Society of India; Proceedings and Transactions of the All-India Oriental Conference, 1933, p 118, All-India Oriental Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore the Kambojas/Gandharas.

==Pukkusati of Gandhara vs Maha Kapphina of Kukkutavati==
[[Anguttara Nikaya]] mentions sixteen great countries that flourished during Buddha's time of which only two i.e.  the ‘Gandhara–[[Kashmira]]’ and the ‘[[Kambojas|Kamboja]]’ were located in [[Uttarapatha]].&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, pp 363,  526,  G. P. Malalasekera. See also entry under Mahajanapada.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Culla-Niddesa'' adds the [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] to the sixteen and substitutes [[Yona]] for the Gandhāra&lt;ref&gt;Culla-Niddesa, (P.T.S.), p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; thus showing that when Chulla-Niddesa was composed, Kamboja Mahajanapada in the Uttarapatha was more important than even the Gandhara and further indicates that Gandhara may have formed part of the Kamboja Mahajanapada at this time. ''In Buddha's time, Gandhāra and Kasmira formed one country since the two countries are always mentioned together in one expression as "Kasmīra-Gandhāra" in the [[Pali]] texts''.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, pp 543, 749,  G. P. Malalasekera; See also: Asoka and His Inscriptions, 1968, p 93, Beni Madhab Barua, Ishwar Nath Topa.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf: "Some Pali texts mention Kasmira and Gandhara as one country ruled by one king" (Asoka and His Inscriptions, 1968, p 93, [[Dr. Benimadhab Barua]], Ishwar Nath Topa).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gandhara Jataka]], Kasmira was included in Gandhara.&lt;ref&gt;Jataka No 406.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asoka and His Inscriptions, 1968, p 93, [[Dr. Benimadhab Barua]], Ishwar Nath Topa.&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddha's time, Pukkusāti, contemporary of the Buddha was the king of Gandhara i.e. '' 'Gandhara-Kasmira' ''. As he learnt about the appearance of Buddha, his Dharama and Sangha from his friend king [[Bimbisara]], Pukkusati immediately decided to become a Buddha follower, ordained himself as a [[monk]], renounced his kingdom and traveled all the way to ''Sāvatthi'' to see the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;See: Papañca Sūdanī, Majjhima Commentary, (Aluvihāa Series, Colombo), ii.979ff); See also: Gandhara in: Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, pp 749,  G. P. Malalasekera.&lt;/ref&gt; Pali texts refer to Maha Kapphina as a great king of the frontier kingdom of Kukkutavati, 300 Yojana in extent, (in Uttarapatha) and also make him contemporary of the Buddha and Pukkusati. Immediately on hearing of the appearance of Buddha and his Law and Sangha, king Maha Kapphina of Kukkatavati renounced the throne, set forth towards Savatthi to see the Buddha, and like king Pukkusati, he too became a Buddha follower and a monk.&lt;ref&gt;See: Maha Kappina Thera in: Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, 2003, p 473 seq, G. P. Malalasekera.&lt;/ref&gt; The above Buddhist evidence makes it quite clear that Pukkusati and Maha Kapphina were contemporary rulers, both belonged to the ''Uttarapatha'', both abnegated the throne and both had become monks and Buddha followers soon after the appearance of Buddha's Law and Sangha. Since according to Pali textual evidence, Pukkusati was king of ‘Gandhara-Kasmira’, hence his contemporary king Maha Kapphina, said to be a great ruler of a frontier country (hence also from Uttarapatha), could not have been a king either of Gandhara or of Kasmira, as D. D. Kosambi speculates. This clearly means that Maha Kapphina could only have been a king of Kamboja alone (''the only other [[Mahajanapadas|Mahajanapada]] or great country located in the Uttarapatha division). And being immediate neighbor to Gandhara, king Maha Kapphina had followed king Pukkusati or vice versa and embraced the Buddhist faith.

==Conclusion==
General Alexander Cunningham has identified Kukkatavati kingdom of Maha Kapphina with Chinese Kipin (=Pāṇinian  [[Kingdom of Kapisa|Kapisa]]) or Greek ''Kophene'' and the ''Kukatagiri'' with some low peak of Hindukush region, which obviously refers to the land of ancient Kambojas. D . D. Kosambi has located Kukkatavati of king Maha Kapphina  near [[Kambojas|Kamboja]] (or [[Kashmir]]).&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to the Study of Indian History, 1996, p 150,  D. D. Kosambi; The Culture and Civilisation of Ancient India in Historical Outline: In Historical Outline, 1965, p 120, D. D. Kosambi.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars like Gauri Shankar and Michael Hahn&lt;ref&gt;Śivasvāmin's Kapphiṇābhyudaya, or, Exaltation of King Kapphiṇa: or, Exaltation of King Kapphiṇa, 1989, Gauri Shankar, Michael Hahn.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the authors of ''Proceedings and Transactions of the All-India Oriental Conference'' and  of ''Indian Linguistics'' also connect Kipin of the Chinese records with Buddhist name Kapphina but identify Kipin with Kashmir.&lt;ref name="All-India Oriental Conference 1933, p 117"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Indian Linguistics, 1966, p 499, Linguistic Society of India - India.&lt;/ref&gt; But it is generally accepted among the scholar community that  the Chinese name Kipin is applied to Kapisa country which was a part of ancient [[Kambojas|Kamboja]]&lt;ref&gt;History and Culture of Indian People, Vol III, pp 122, 617, Dr [[R. C. Majumdar]], Dr A. D. Pusalkar, Dr. K. M. Munshi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Indian Antiquaries, 52, part 2, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pre Aryan and Pre Dravidian in India, 1993 edition, p 121, Dr Sylvain Lévi, Dr Jules Bloch, Dr Jean Przyluski, Asian Educational Services.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geographical and Economic Studies in the Mahābhārata: Upāyana Parva, 1945, p 43, Dr Moti Chandra - India.&lt;/ref&gt; (See: [[Kapisa Province]]). Hence Kapphina and Kapin/Kipin must be related not to [[Kashmir]] but to the [[Kingdom of Kapisa|Kapisa]] (''[[Kafiristan]]/[[Kohistan District, Pakistan|Kohistan]]'') and to Kophene (Kabul) and therefore, to the [[Kambojas|Kamboja]]. Since [[Ashvakas]] of Mashkavati (Massaga) and Kunar valleys were merely a specialized branch (i.e. ''Ashva-Yuddha-Kushalah'') of the more general ethnic term Kamboja, hence D. D.Kosambi's views also reinforce the conclusion that Maha Kaphina was probably a ruler of the Ashvaka country of the Kambojas which around the time of Buddha was only a provincial district of the bigger Kamboja [[Mahajanapada]]. ''It is also not very insignificant to note that there still exists among the modern [[Kamboj]] a clan name known as Kukkar (&lt; Kukkad/Kukkat) who claim to have come to Punjab from north-west across the [[Indus]]''.

'''Maris Bustamante''' (born November 10, 1949) is a Mexican interdisciplinary artist who has presented her work in 21 solo exhibitions and over 400 group shows in Mexico and internationally. She has conceived, written, produced and executed more than 250 performances, installations, environments and two big “contraespectáculos” (anti-shows). She has presented performance art pieces through television broadcasts, which she called "social performances" involving the non-arts public. She also designs sets, costumes, and props for theatre, television, and cinema.

== Education ==
She studied at Escuela Nacional de Pintura Y Escultura "La Esmeralda," one of the two top art schools in Mexico, from 1968 to 1973.&lt;ref name="The Banff Center"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maris Bustamante|url=http://www.banffcentre.ca/faculty/faculty-member/2007/maris-bustamante/|website=The Banff Center|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Archivo Virtual de Artes Escénicas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maris Bustamante (México - 1949 )|url=http://artesescenicas.uclm.es/index.php?sec=artis&amp;id=54|website=Archivo Virtual de Artes Escénicas|accessdate=7 March 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artwork and performance ==
In the 1970s, she began working as a conceptual artist, participating in the Groups ("Los Grupos") Movement in México City. She worked with the group [[NO GRUPO]] since its founding in 1979, until its dissolution six years later. SInce producing her first happening in 1971, she has researched non-traditional narratives.&lt;ref name="Archivo Virtual de Artes Escénicas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Banff Center" /&gt;

From 1977 to 1983, No Grupo staged several performances each year. In 1979, Bustamante spearheaded their extremely satirical ''Patente del Taco'' (1984'')''. The piece primarily consisted of Bustamante’s application for and reception of a patent for the taco, an indigenous Mexican food. The taco and patent were photographed in erotic ways, with the food arranged vertically and decorated with slogans such as “Atrévase a cometer un acto erótico cómase un taco” (commit an erotic act: eat a taco). The images were then blown up to a cartoonish side to symbolize the inflated role of machismo in Mexican culture.&lt;ref&gt;McCaughan, Edward J. ''Art and Social Movements: Cultural Politics in Mexico and Aztaln.'' Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, with [[Mónica Mayer]], she founded the first feminist art collective in Mexico, [[Polvo de Gallina Negra]] (Black Hen Powder).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polvo de Gallina Negra on pintomiraya.com|url=http://www.pintomiraya.com/pmr/gallina-negra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bustamante and Mayer's work combined radical social criticism and humour, exemplified by the group’s name: “Black Hen Powder – to protect us from the patriarchal magic which makes women disappear.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Re.Act.Feminism|publisher=Live Art Development Agency - Verlag fur Modern Kunst|isbn=978-3-86984-460-2|pages=290|url=http://www.thisisliveart.co.uk/publishing/reactfeminism-2-a-performing-archive/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stambaugh|first1=Antonio Prieto|title=Holy Terrors: Latin American Women Perform|date=2003|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3240-X|page=249|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5gIK7DPAzMC&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=Maris%20Bustamante&amp;pg=PA249#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Wrestling the Phallus, Resisting Amnesia: The Body Politics of Chilanga Performance Artists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For one performance, ¡MADRES! (1984), Bustamante and Mayer became pregnant at the same time so they could experience the conditions of pregnancy in Mexico. One element of the performance was a television series on Canal 2 de Televisa Mexico called “Mother for a Day,” in which Bustamante and Mayer “impregnated” famous men like anchorman Guillermo Ochoa (1987). A key discussion topic on the show was domestic life, with a focus on the massive amount of labor that goes into motherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Brooklyn Museum. ''Brooklyn Museum: Monica P. Mayer.'' &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/feminist_art_base/monica-p-mayer&lt;/nowiki&gt; (accessed February 10, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCaughan, Edward J.

In some instances a wrongful conviction is not overturned for several decades, or until after the innocent person has been [[wrongful execution|executed]], released from custody, or has died.

"Miscarriage of justice" is sometimes synonymous with wrongful conviction, referring to a conviction reached in an unfair or disputed [[trial (law)|trial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Miscarriage of Justice Law and Legal Definition |url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/m/miscarriage-of-justice/ |accessdate=2018-11-05 |publisher=definitions.uslegal.com |quote=The term 'miscarriage of justice' refers to a legal act or verdict that is clearly mistaken, unfair, or improper. Primarily, a miscarriage of justice is the [[conviction]] and [[punishment]] of a person for a crime they did not commit.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wrongful convictions are frequently cited by death penalty opponents as cause to eliminate death penalties to avoid executing innocent persons. In recent years, [[genetic fingerprinting|DNA evidence]] has been used to clear many people falsely convicted.

The [[Scandinavian language]]s (viz. Danish, Norwegian and Swedish) have a word, the Swedish variant of which is ''justitiemord'', which literally translates as "justice murder." The term exists in several languages and was originally used for cases where the accused was convicted, executed, and later cleared after death. While a miscarriage of justice is a [[Type I error]] for falsely identifying culpability, an [[error of impunity]] would be a [[Type II error]] of failing to find a culpable person guilty. However, the term "miscarriage of justice" is often used to describe the latter type as well.

With capital punishment decreasing, the expression has acquired an extended meaning, namely any conviction for a crime not committed by the convicted. The retention of the term "murder" represents both universal abhorrence against wrongful convictions and awareness of how destructive wrongful convictions are. Some [[Slavic language]]s have also the word (''justičná vražda'' in Slovak, ''justiční vražda'' in Czech) which literally translates as "justice murder", but it is used for [[Judicial murder]], while miscarriage of justice is "justiční omyl" in Czech, implying an error of the justice system, not a deliberate manipulation.

The term '''{{vanchor|travesty of justice}}''' is sometimes used for a gross, deliberate miscarriage of justice. [[Show trial]]s (not in the sense of high publicity, but in the sense of lack of regard to the actual legal procedure and fairness), due to their character, often lead to such travesties.

The concept of miscarriage of justice has important implications for [[standard of review]], in that an [[appellate court]] will often only exercise its discretion to correct plain error when a miscarriage of justice (or "manifest injustice") would otherwise occur.

==General issues==
Causes of miscarriages of justice include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Safety from False Convictions|last=Sangero|first=Boaz|publisher=CreateSpace|year=2016|isbn=978-1536823738|location=United States|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Plea bargain]]s that offer incentives for the innocent to plead guilty, sometimes called an [[innocent prisoner's dilemma]]
* [[Confirmation bias]] on the part of investigators
* Withholding or [[destruction of evidence]] by police or [[prosecutor|prosecution]]
* Fabrication of evidence or outright [[perjury]] by police (see [[testilying]]), or prosecution witnesses (e.g., [[Charles Randal Smith]])
* Biased editing of evidence
* Prejudice against the class of people to which the defendant belongs
* [[Mistaken identity|Misidentification]] of the perpetrator by witnesses and/or victims
* Overestimation/underestimation of the evidential value of [[expert witness|expert testimony]]
* [[Contaminated evidence]]
* Faulty [[forensic science|forensic]] tests
* [[False confession]]s due to police pressure or psychological weakness
* Misdirection of a jury by a judge during trial
* [[perjury|Perjured]] evidence by the real guilty party or their accomplices ([[frameup]])
* Perjured evidence by the alleged victim or their accomplices
* Conspiracy between court of appeal judges and prosecutors to uphold conviction of the innocent

A risk of miscarriages of justice is one of the main arguments against the death penalty. Where condemned persons are executed promptly after conviction, the most significant effect of a miscarriage of justice is irreversible. Wrongly executed people nevertheless occasionally receive posthumous [[pardon]]s—which essentially [[void (law)|void]] the conviction—or have their convictions quashed. Many death penalty states hold condemned persons for ten or more years before execution, so that any new evidence that might acquit them (or, at least, provide [[reasonable doubt]]) will have had time to surface.

Even when a wrongly convicted person is not executed, years in prison can have a substantial, irreversible effect on the person and their family. The risk of miscarriage of justice is therefore also an argument against long sentences, like a life sentence, and cruel prison conditions.

The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] requires the victims of miscarriage of justice to be compensated.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], Article 14, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rate of occurrence== 
Various studies estimate that in the United States, between 2.3 and 5% of all prisoners are innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How many innocent people are there in prison? |publisher=[[The Innocence Project]] |url=http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/How_many_innocent_people_are_there_in_prison.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110182624/http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/How_many_innocent_people_are_there_in_prison.php |dead-url=true |archivedate=2014-11-10 |accessdate=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study estimated that up to 10,000 people may be wrongfully convicted of serious crimes each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/ronhuff.htm|title=10,000 INNOCENT PEOPLE CONVICTED EACH YEAR, STUDY ESTIMATES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study estimated that 4.1% of inmates awaiting execution on death row in the United States are innocent, and that at least 340 innocent people may have been executed since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/many-prisoners-on-death-row-are-wrongfully-convicted/|title=Many Prisoners on Death Row are Wrongfully Convicted|author=Dina Fine Maron|work=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Professor Boaz Sangero of the College of Law and Business in [[Ramat Gan]] in Israel, most wrongful convictions are for crimes less serious than major felonies such as rape and murder, as judicial systems are less careful in dealing with those cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.589646|title=How You Could Land in Jail for Committing No Crime|work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural consequences===
Wrongful convictions appear at first to be "rightful" arrests and subsequent convictions, and also include a public statement about a particular crime having occurred, as well as a particular individual or individuals having committed that crime. If the conviction turns out to be a miscarriage of justice, then one or both of these statements is ultimately deemed to be false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edmond|first=G.|title=Constructing Miscarriages of Justice: Misunderstanding Scientific Evidence in High Profile Criminal Appeals|journal=Oxford Journal of Legal Studies|year=2002|volume=22|issue=1|pages=53–89|doi=10.1093/ojls/22.1.53}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time between the miscarriage of justice and its correction, the public holds false beliefs about the occurrence of a crime, the perpetrator of a crime, or both. While the public audience of a miscarriage of justice certainly varies, they may in some cases be as large as an entire nation or multitude of nations.

In cases where a large-scale audience is unknowingly witness to a miscarriage of justice, the news-consuming public may develop false beliefs about the nature of crime itself. It may also cause the public to falsely believe that certain types of crime exist, or that certain types of people tend to commit these crimes, or that certain crimes are more commonly prevalent than they actually are. Thus, wrongful convictions can ultimately mold a society's popular beliefs about crime. Because our understanding of crime is socially constructed, it has been shaped by many factors other than its actual occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rafter|first=N.|title=The Social Construction of Crime and Crime Control|journal=Journal of Research on Crime and Delinquency|year=1990|volume=27|issue=4|pages=376–389|doi=10.1177/0022427890027004004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass media may also be faulted for distorting the public perception of crime by over-representing certain races and genders as criminals and victims, and for highlighting more sensational and invigorating types of crimes as being more newsworthy. The way a media presents crime-related issues may have an influence not only on a society's fear of crime but also on its beliefs about the causes of criminal behavior and desirability of one or another approach to crime control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haney|first=C.|title=Death by Design: Capital Punishment as a Social Psychological System|year=2005|publisher=Oxford: Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, this may have a significant impact on critical public beliefs about emerging forms of crime such as cybercrime, global crime, and terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first=P.K.|title=Policing Contingencies|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are unfavorable psychological effects, even in the absence of any public knowledge. In an experiment, participants significantly reduced their pro-social behavior after being wrongfully sanctioned. As a consequence there were negative effects for the entire group.&lt;ref&gt;Grechenig, Nicklisch &amp; Thoeni, Punishment Despite Reasonable Doubt – A Public Goods Experiment with Sanctions under Uncertainty, Journal of Empirical Legal Studies (JELS) 2010, vol. 7 (4), p. 847-867 [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1733792 (ssrn).]&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of wrongful sanctions varies between societies.&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann, Benedikt, Christian Thöni, and Simon Gächter.

==Cases in specific countries==
{{main article|List of miscarriage of justice cases}}

===Canada===
In 1959, 14-year-old [[Steven Truscott]] was convicted of raping and murdering a 12-year-old girl. Originally sentenced to death by [[hanging]], his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He was released on parole in 1969, and was freed from his parole restrictions in 1974. In 2007, the [[Ontario Court of Appeal]] overturned Truscott's conviction, based on a reexamination of forensic evidence.&lt;ref name="Truscott"&gt;{{cite journal|last=The Associated Press|title=Canadian Court Overturns 1959 Murder Verdict|journal=The New York Times|date=August 29, 2007|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Ontario awarded him [[Canadian dollar|$]]6.5&amp;nbsp;million in compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/news/2008/20080707-truscott-nr.asp|title=Newsroom : Results|website=attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, [[Donald Marshall Jr.]], a [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] man, was wrongly convicted of murder. Marshall spent 11 years in jail before being acquitted in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Acquitted in killing, Marshall is jubilant|work=The Globe and Mail|date=May 11, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case inspired a number of questions about the fairness of the Canadian justice system, especially given that Marshall was an [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]]: as the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] put it, "The name Donald Marshall is almost synonymous with 'wrongful conviction' and the fight for native justice in Canada."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/lifeandtimes/marshall.html Reluctant Hero: The Donald Marshall Story] Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Retrieved January 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall received a lifetime pension of [[Canadian dollar|$]]1.5&amp;nbsp;million in compensation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Donald Marshall Jr|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/donald-marshall-jr/|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Canada|accessdate=2016-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his conviction resulted in changes to the [[Canada Evidence Act]] so that any evidence obtained by the prosecution must be presented to the defence on disclosure.

In 1970, [[David Milgaard]] was wrongfully convicted for the rape and murder of [[Gail Miller (murder victim)|Gail Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.sk.ca/milgaard/pubdocs/10312005/TDRCaldwell/054461.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618040216/http://www.justice.gov.sk.ca/milgaard/pubdocs/10312005/TDRCaldwell/054461.pdf |archivedate=2015-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released in 1992 and compensated [[Canadian dollar|$]]10&amp;nbsp;million by the Saskatchewan government after having spent 23 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Milgaard will get $10&amp;nbsp;million compensation|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/milgaard-will-get-10-million-compensation-1.174896|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=2016-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being tied to it by DNA evidence, serial rapist [[Larry Fisher (murderer)]] was convicted of the murder in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/larry-fisher-killer-behind-david-milgaard-s-wrongful-conviction-dies-in-prison-1.3108684|title=Killer behind David Milgaard's wrongful conviction dies in prison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, [[Guy Paul Morin]] was convicted of the 1984 rape and murder of an 8-year-old girl and was sentenced to life imprisonment. In 1995, new testing of DNA evidence showed Morin could not have been the murderer, and the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned his conviction.&lt;ref name=canenc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/guy-paul-morin-case/|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Canada|accessdate=2016-02-26|title=Guy Paul Morin Case}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case has been described as "a compendium of official error – from inaccurate eyewitness testimony and police tunnel vision, to scientific bungling and the suppression of evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Makin|first1=Kirk|title=Guy Paul Morin Case|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/guy-paul-morin-case/|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Canada|accessdate=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morin received [[Canadian dollar|$]]1.25&amp;nbsp;million in compensation from the Ontario government.&lt;ref name=canenc/&gt;

===Italy===
[[Enzo Tortora]], a TV host on national RAI television, was accused of being a member of the Camorra and drug trafficking.  He was arrested in 1983, and sentenced to ten years in jail in 1985, but acquitted of all charges on appeal in 1986.&lt;ref name=flo301008&gt;[http://www.theflorentine.net/articles/article-view.asp?issuetocId=3705 Enzo Tortora: When justice miscarries], The Florentine, October 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Raffaele Sollecito and American [[Amanda Knox]] were sentenced to 26 years imprisonment for the 2007 [[Murder of Meredith Kercher]].  They were released in 2011 after an appeal court found there was no credible evidence against them.  Petty burglar Rudy Guede has been convicted of murder and sexual assault in connection with the death of Ms. Kercher.

===The Netherlands===
The Schiedammerpark murder case, as well as the similarly overturned case of the Putten murder, led to the installation of the "Posthumus I committee", which analyzed what had gone wrong in the Schiedammerpark Murder case, and came to the conclusion that [[confirmation bias]] led the police to ignore and misinterpret scientific evidence (DNA). Subsequently, the so-called Posthumus II committee investigated whether other such cases might have occurred. The committee received 25 applications from concerned and involved scientists, and decided to consider three of them further: the [[Lucia de Berk]] case, the Ina Post case, and the Enschede incest case. In these three cases, independent researchers (professors [[Willem Albert Wagenaar|Wagenaar]], van Koppen, Israëls, Crombag, and Derksen) claim confirmation bias and misuse of complex scientific evidence led to miscarriages of justice.

===Norway===
Norwegian police, courts, and prison authorities have been criticized and convicted on several occasions by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] for breaking the principle of [[innocent until proven guilty]]. However, the maximum penalty in Norway is normally no longer than 21 years. Thereby, most of the victims have been acquitted after their release from prison.

===Poland===
On December 31, 1996 in Miłoszyce, Poland, a 15-year-old girl was brutally raped and murdered. Tomasz Komenda, then 21, was arrested. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment. Komenda was regularly abused by fellow prisoners and guards, he tried to commit suicide 3 times. In 2018 when new evidence came out, Komenda was paroled and in May 2018 his conviction was overturned and Komenda was oficially exonerated by the [[Supreme Court of Poland]]. He and his barrister stated, that they would demand 18 000 000 PLN compensation.

===Spain===
The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution of Spain]] guarantees compensation in cases of miscarriage of justice.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom a jailed person, whose conviction is quashed, might be paid [[Damages|compensation]] for the time they were incarcerated. This is currently limited by statute to a maximum sum of £1,000,000 for those who have been incarcerated for more than ten years and £500,000 for any other cases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/23/britain-refusing-compensate-victims-miscarriage-justice|title=Why is Britain refusing to compensate victims of miscarriage of justice?|publisher=Duncan Campbell, The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with deductions for the cost of food and prison cell during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/man-wrongly-jailed-for-three-years-charged-7000-by-home-office-for-board-and-lodging-6585803.html|title=Man wrongly jailed for three years charged £7,000 by Home Office for 'board and lodging'|work=London Evening Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[:Category:Overturned convictions in the United Kingdom|Overturned convictions in the United Kingdom]].

Richard Foster, the Chairman of the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]] (CCRC), reported in October 2018 that the single biggest cause of miscarriage of justice was the failure to disclose vital evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/oct/11/failure-disclose-evidence-miscarriage-justice-warning-criminal-cases-review-commission|title=Failure to disclose vital evidence in criminal cases growing, says watchdog|last=Bowcott|first=Owen|date=2018-10-11|website=The Guardian|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====England, Wales and Northern Ireland====
Until 2005, the parole system assumed all convicted persons were guilty, and poorly handled those who were not. To be paroled, a convicted person had to sign a document in which, among other things, they confessed to the crime for which they were convicted. Someone who refused to sign this declaration spent longer in jail than someone who signed it. Some wrongly convicted people, such as the [[Birmingham Six]], were refused parole for this reason. In 2005 the system changed, and began to parole prisoners who never admitted guilt.

English law has no official means of correcting a "perverse" verdict (conviction of a defendant on the basis of insufficient evidence). Appeals are based exclusively on new evidence or errors by the judge or prosecution (but not the defence), or jury irregularities. A reversal occurred, however, in the 1930s when [[William Herbert Wallace]] was exonerated of the murder of his wife. There is no right to a trial ''without'' jury (except during the troubles in Northern Ireland or in the case where there is a significant risk of jury-tampering, such as organised crime cases, when a judge or judges presided without a jury).

During the early 1990s, a series of high-profile cases turned out to be miscarriages of justice. Many resulted from police fabricating evidence to convict people they thought were guilty, or simply to get a high conviction rate. The [[West Midlands Serious Crime Squad]] became notorious for such practices, and was disbanded in 1989. In 1997 the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccrc.gov.uk|title=Criminal Cases Review Commission|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|accessdate=2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established specifically to examine possible miscarriages of justice. However, it still requires either strong new evidence of innocence, or new proof of a legal error by the judge or prosecution. For example, merely insisting you are innocent and the jury made an error, or stating there was not enough evidence to prove guilt, is not enough. It is not possible to question the jury's decision or query on what matters it was based. The waiting list for cases to be considered for review is at least two years on average.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In 2002, the NI Court of Appeal made an exception to who could avail of the right to a fair trial in R v Walsh: ''"... if a defendant has been denied a fair trial it will almost be inevitable that the conviction will be regarded unsafe, the present case in our view constitutes an exception to the general rule. ... the conviction is to be regarded as safe, even if a breach of Article 6(1) were held to have occurred in the present case."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial+Decisions/JanJune02/j_j_car3538final.htm|title=Appeal Court Judgment}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Christy Walsh (Case)]].)

====Scotland====
The [[Criminal Appeal (Scotland) Act 1927]] increased the jurisdiction of the [[Scottish Court of Criminal Appeal]] following the miscarriage of justice surrounding the [[Trial of Oscar Slater]].

Reflecting [[Scots law|Scotland's own legal system]], which differs from that of the rest of the United Kingdom, the [[Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission]] (SCCRC) was established in April 1999. All cases accepted by the SCCRC are subjected to a robust and thoroughly impartial review before a decision on whether or not to refer to the [[High Court of Justiciary]] is taken.

===United States===
: ''For a list of exonerations after death sentences, see [[List of exonerated death row inmates]].''

In June 2012, the [[National Registry of Exonerations]], a joint project of the University of Michigan Law School and Northwestern University Law School, initially reported 873 individual exonerations in the U.S. from January 1989 through February 2012; the report called this number "tiny" in a country with [[United States incarceration rate|2.3&amp;nbsp;million people in prisons and jails]], but asserted that there are far more false convictions than exonerations.&lt;ref name=UMichLaw20120622&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/exonerations_us_1989_2012_full_report.pdf |title=Exonerations in the United States, 1989 – 2012 / Report by the National Registry of Exonerations |last1=Gross |first1=Samuel R. |last2=Shaffer |first2=Michael |date=June 22, 2012 |publisher=University of Michigan Law School |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LfYUz1vy?url=http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/exonerations_us_1989_2012_full_report.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-06 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, the number of individual exonerations was reported as 1,733, with 2015 having the highest annual number of exonerations since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/13/opinion/prisoners-exonerated-prosecutors-exposed.html|title=Prisoners Exonerated, Prosecutors Exposed|last=The Editorial Board|date=2016-02-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-10|issn=0362-4331|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6twgj2OlI?url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/13/opinion/prisoners-exonerated-prosecutors-exposed.html|archivedate=2017-10-03|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of Joseph Roger O'Dell III, executed in Virginia in 1997 for a rape and murder, a prosecuting attorney bluntly argued in court in 1998 that if posthumous DNA results exonerated O'Dell, "it would be shouted from the rooftops that ... Virginia executed an innocent man." The state prevailed, and the evidence was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Lois Romano, "[http://www.truthinjustice.org/DNA-DP.htm When DNA Meets Death Row, It's the System That's Tested]", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', December 12, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, in [[Massachusetts]], a chemist admitted tampering with evidence and falsifying results regarding over 21,000 drug convictions from 2004 to 2013 by not undertaking tests and stating untested results were positive for illegal drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/21000-drug-convictions-set-to-be-quashed-after-massachusetts-chemist-tampered-with-evidence-10842765 |title=21,000 drug convictions set to be quashed after Massachusetts chemist tampered with evidence |publisher=Sky News |date=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Urban League Young Professionals''' ('''NULYP'''),  is a [[National Urban League]] [[Volunteering|volunteer]], member, auxiliary that targets [[professional]]s ages 21–40 to empower their communities and change lives through the Urban League Movement.  Its current president is Carlos Clanton.
[[File:Google NULYP Logo.png|right|thumb|320x320px]]

==History==

In the late 1980s, several Urban League affiliates recognized the need to prepare a new generation of young leaders to take the mantle of [[leadership]] of the [[Civil rights in the United States|civil rights]] movement. Young [[African Americans|African American]] men and women, between the ages of 20-40, were invited to participate in and take an active leadership role in their local Affiliate Urban League programs and activities.

These auxiliary groups actively supported the Urban League movement by educating other young professionals about the movement, recruiting new members, volunteering, sponsoring educational initiatives like [[youth mentoring]] and [[tutor]]ing programs, coordinating [[Fundraising|fundraisers]] for [[scholarship]]s, and delivering [[Personal development|personal]] and [[professional development]] and networking opportunities to young professionals in their local communities.

As these auxiliaries began to grow, the Affiliate leadership took note of their success and began to ponder the power of a national movement of young professionals across the country.  Hugh Price, then president and CEO of the National Urban League, realized the need to make this potential national movement into a reality. He held a historic "Young Professionals Dialog Session" with over 200 [[young professional]]s in the [[New York metropolitan area|New York area]] in April 1998. This dialog session, in addition to a [[white paper]] submitted by Marcus Mitchell, ignited the spark that led to the formation of a [[working group]], tasked with establishing the framework and foundation for the National Urban League Young Professionals.
Under the direction of Annelle Lewis, senior vice president of affiliate development and programs, the working group again convened in [[New York City|New York]] in September 1998.

The National Urban League Young Professionals (NULYP) was unveiled at the 1999 National Urban League Annual Conference in [[Houston|Houston, TX]].  Marcus Mitchell assumed the role of president and under his leadership, the organization began to define itself and to carve out its role in the National Urban League movement. The leadership team met on regularly to refine the structure of the organization as well as to develop its first draft of by-laws. Soon thereafter, a special election was held to fill the open positions on the newly established NULYP executive board.

==Current status==
Today, there are over 62 chapters and 5,500 members supporting Urban League affiliate offices located in 35 states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]].

In October 2014, the National Urban League Young Professionals announced a partnership with the Alabama Power Foundation to present the "LEAD [YP]" Conference, January 15–18, 2015 at the [[Birmingham–Jefferson Convention Complex|Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Center]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]].  It was designed to equip today's diverse [[Millennials]] and [[Generation X|Gen-Xers]] from across the [[United States|nation]] with training and tools to be leaders in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=NULYP Hosts "LEAD [YP] Conference: Preparing the Next Generation of Leaders |publisher=National Urban League Young Professionals |date=October 7, 2014 |url= http://www.prlog.org/12380240-nulyp-hosts-lead-yp-conference-preparing-the-next-generation-of-leaders.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3454">A native system of weights and measures was used by [[Tatars]] until 1924, but became obsolete when the [[Soviet Union]] adopted the [[metric system]].

The Tatar system shares many units with the [[Obsolete Russian weights and measures|Russian system]] (e.g. ''sajın'' and ''disätinä''), which is close to the English (The [[Obsolete Russian weights and measures|Russian system]] existed since [[ancient Rus']], but under [[Peter the Great]], the Russian units were redefined relative to the [[English unit|English system]].), therefore a ''duym'' is relatively equal to an inch.  This list includes their [[Tatar language]] names.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8020">In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], '''Penrose graphical notation''' or '''tensor diagram notation''' is a (usually handwritten) visual depiction of [[multilinear function]]s or [[tensor]]s proposed by [[Roger Penrose]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Penrose]], "Applications of negative dimensional tensors," in ''Combinatorial Mathematics and its Applications'', Academic Press (1971). See Vladimir Turaev, ''Quantum invariants of knots and 3-manifolds'' (1994), De Gruyter, p. 71 for a brief commentary.&lt;/ref&gt; A diagram in the notation consists of several shapes linked together by lines. The notation has been studied extensively by [[Predrag Cvitanović]], who used it to classify the [[classical Lie groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Predrag Cvitanović]] |year=2008 |title=Group Theory: Birdtracks, Lie's, and Exceptional Groups | publisher=Princeton University Press | url=http://birdtracks.eu/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been generalized using [[representation theory]] to [[spin network]]s in physics, and with the presence of [[matrix group]]s to [[trace diagram]]s in [[linear algebra]].

== Interpretations ==

=== Multilinear algebra ===

In the language of [[multilinear algebra]], each shape represents a [[multilinear function]]. The lines attached to shapes represent the inputs or outputs of a function, and attaching shapes together in some way is essentially the [[composition of functions]].

=== Tensors ===

In the language of [[tensor|tensor algebra]], a particular tensor is associated with a particular shape with many lines projecting upwards and downwards, corresponding to [[abstract index notation|abstract]] [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|upper and lower]] indices of tensors respectively. Connecting lines between two shapes corresponds to [[tensor contraction|contraction of indices]]. One advantage of this [[Mathematical notation|notation]] is that one does not have to invent new letters for new indices. This notation is also explicitly [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]-independent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Penrose]], ''[[The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe]]'', 2005, {{isbn|0-09-944068-7}}, Chapter ''Manifolds of n dimensions''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Matrices ===
Each shape represents a matrix, and [[tensor product|tensor multiplication]] is done horizontally, and [[matrix multiplication]] is done vertically.

== Representation of special tensors ==

=== Metric tensor ===
The [[metric tensor]] is represented by a U-shaped loop or an upside-down U-shaped loop, depending on the type of tensor that is used.
{|
|[[File:Penrose g.svg|framed|metric tensor &lt;math&gt;g^{ab}&lt;/math&gt;]]
|[[File:Penrose g ab.svg|framed|metric tensor &lt;math&gt;g_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;]]
|}

=== Levi-Civita tensor ===
The [[Levi-Civita tensor|Levi-Civita antisymmetric tensor]] is represented by a thick horizontal bar with sticks pointing downwards or upwards, depending on the type of tensor that is used.
{|
|valign="top"|[[File:Penrose varepsilon a-n.svg|framed|&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ab\ldots n}&lt;/math&gt;]]
|valign="top"|[[File:Penrose epsilon^a-n.svg|framed|&lt;math&gt;\epsilon^{ab\ldots n}&lt;/math&gt;]]
|valign="top"|[[File:Penrose varepsilon a-n epsilon^a-n.svg|framed|&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ab\ldots n}\,\epsilon^{ab\ldots n}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= n!&lt;/math&gt;]]
|}

=== Structure constant ===
&lt;!-- {| 
| --&gt; [[File:Penrose gamma ab^c.svg|thumb|x120px|structure constant &lt;math&gt;{\gamma_{\alpha\beta}}^\chi = -{\gamma_{\beta\alpha}}^\chi&lt;/math&gt;]]
&lt;!-- |[[File:Penrose killing form.svg|thumb|x150px|[[Killing form]] &lt;math&gt;\kappa_{\alpha\beta}=\kappa_{\beta\alpha}=\gamma_{\alpha\zeta}^{\ \ \xi}\,\gamma_{\beta\xi}^{\ \ \zeta}&lt;/math&gt;]]
|}  --&gt;
The structure constants (&lt;math&gt;{\gamma_{ab}}^c&lt;/math&gt;) of a [[Lie algebra]] are represented by a small triangle with one line pointing upwards and two lines pointing downwards.

== Tensor operations ==

=== Contraction of indices ===

[[Tensor contraction|Contraction]] of indices is represented by joining the index lines together.
{|
|[[File:Penrose delta^a b.svg|thumb|x120px|[[Kronecker delta]] &lt;math&gt;\delta^a_b&lt;/math&gt;]]
|[[File:Penrose beta a xi^a.svg|thumb|x120px|[[Dot product]] &lt;math&gt;\beta_a\,\xi^a&lt;/math&gt;]]
|[[File:Penrose g ab g^bc-d^c a-g^cb g ba.svg|thumb|x120px|&lt;math&gt;g_{ab}\,g^{bc} = \delta_a^c = g^{cb}\,g_{ba}&lt;/math&gt;]]
|}

=== Symmetrization ===

[[Symmetric tensor|Symmetrization]] of indices is represented by a thick zig-zag or wavy bar crossing the index lines horizontally.
{|
|[[File:Penrose asymmetric Q^a-n.svg|thumb|x120px|Symmetrization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;Q^{(ab\ldots n)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(with &lt;math&gt;{}_{Q^{ab}=Q^{[ab]}+Q^{(ab)}}&lt;/math&gt;)]]
|}

=== Antisymmetrization ===

[[Antisymmetric tensor|Antisymmetrization]] of indices is represented by a thick straight line crossing the index lines horizontally.
{|
|[[File:Penrose symmetric E a-n.svg|thumb|x120px|Antisymmetrization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;E_{[ab\ldots n]}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(with &lt;math&gt;{}_{E_{ab}=E_{[ab]}+E_{(ab)}}&lt;/math&gt;)]]
|}

==Determinant==

The determinant is formed by applying antisymmetrization to the indices.
{|
|[[File:Penrose det T.svg|thumb|x120px|[[Determinant]] &lt;math&gt;\det\mathbf{T} = \det\left(T^a_{\ b}\right)&lt;/math&gt;]]
|[[File:Penrose T^-1.svg|thumb|x120px|Inverse of matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}^{-1} = \left(T^a_{\ b}\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;]]
|}

=== Covariant derivative ===

The [[covariant derivative]] (&lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;) is represented by a circle around the tensor(s) to be differentiated and a line joined from the circle pointing downwards to represent the lower index of the derivative.
{|
|[[File:Penrose covariant derivate.svg|framed|covariant derivative &lt;math&gt;
12\nabla_a\left( \xi^f\,\lambda^{(d}_{fb[c}\,D^{e)b}_{gh]} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;= 12\left(  \xi^f (\nabla_a \lambda^{(d}_{fb[c}) \, D^{e)b}_{gh]} + (\nabla_a \xi^f) \lambda^{(d}_{fb[c}\,D^{e)b}_{gh]} + \xi^f \lambda^{(d}_{fb[c} \, (\nabla_a D^{e)b}_{gh]} ) \right)
&lt;/math&gt;]]
|}

== Tensor manipulation ==

The diagrammatic notation is useful in manipulating tensor algebra. It usually involves a few simple "[[Identity (mathematics)|identities]]" of tensor manipulations.

For example, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{a...c} \epsilon^{a...c} = n!&lt;/math&gt;, where ''n'' is the number of dimensions, is a common "identity".

===Riemann curvature tensor===

The Ricci and Bianchi identities given in terms of the Riemann curvature tensor illustrate the power of the notation

{|
|[[File:Penrose riemann curvature tensor.svg|thumb|x120px|Notation for the [[Riemann curvature tensor]]]]
|[[File:Penrose ricci tensor.svg|thumb|x120px|[[Ricci tensor]] &lt;math&gt;R_{ab} = R_{acb}^{\ \ \ c}&lt;/math&gt;]]
|[[File:Penrose ricci identity.svg|thumb|x120px|Ricci identity &lt;math&gt;(\nabla_a\,\nabla_b -\nabla_b\,\nabla_a)\,\mathbf{\xi}^d&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= R_{abc}^{\ \ \ d}\,\mathbf{\xi}^c&lt;/math&gt;]]
|[[File:Penrose bianchi identity.svg|thumb|120px|[[Bianchi identity]] &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{[a} R_{bc]d}^{\ \ \ e} = 0&lt;/math&gt;]]
|}

==Extensions==

The notation has been extended with support for [[spinor]]s and [[Twistor theory|twistor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Spinors and Space-Time: Vol I, Two-Spinor Calculus and Relativistic Fields |last1=Penrose |first1=R. |last2=Rindler |first2=W. |pages=424–434 |year=1984 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-24527-3 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CzhhKkf1xJUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Spinors and Space-Time: Vol. II, Spinor and Twistor Methods in Space-Time Geometry  |last1=Penrose |first1=R. |last2=Rindler |first2=W. |year=1986 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-25267-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0mgGmtx0GEC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perceptual learning''' is [[learning]] better [[perception]] skills such as differentiating two [[musical tone]]s from one another or categorizations of spatial and temporal patterns relevant to real-world expertise 
as in [[Reading (process)|reading]], seeing relations among [[chess]] pieces, knowing whether or not an [[X-ray]] image shows a tumor.

[[Sensory modalities]] may include [[visual]], auditory, tactile, olfactory, and taste. Perceptual learning forms important foundations of complex [[cognitive]] processes (i.e., language) and interacts with other kinds of learning to produce perceptual expertise.&lt;ref name ="Kellman2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kellman|first=P. J.|year=2002|chapter=Perceptual learning|editors=Pashler, H., Gallistel, R.|title=Stevens' Handbook of Experimental Psychology|volume=3: Learning, Motivation, and Emotion|edition=3rd|place=New York|publisher=Wiley|doi=10.1002/0471214426.pas0307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldstone, R.

The ability for perceptual learning is retained throughout life.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karni | first1 = A | last2 = Sagi | first2 = D | year = 1993 | title = The time course of learning a visual skill | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 365 | issue = 6443| pages = 250–252 | doi = 10.1038/365250a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Basic sensory discriminations===
Laboratory studies reported many examples of dramatic improvements in sensitivities from appropriately structured perceptual [[learning]] tasks. In visual [[Vernier acuity]] tasks, observers judge whether one line is displaced above or below a second line. Untrained observers are often already very good with this task, but after training, observers' [[absolute threshold|threshold]] has been shown to improve as much as 6 fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Westheimer | first1 = G | last2 = McKee | first2 = SP | year = 1978 | title = Stereoscopic acuity for moving retinal images | url = | journal = Journal of the Optical Society of America | volume = 68 | issue = 4| pages = 450–455 | doi = 10.1364/JOSA.68.000450 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saarinen | first1 = J | last2 = Levi | first2 = DM | year = 1995 | title = Perceptual learning in vernier acuity: What is learned? | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 35 | issue = 4| pages = 519–527 | doi = 10.1016/0042-6989(94)00141-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Poggio | first1 = T. | last2 = Fahle | first2 = M. | last3 = Edelman | first3 = S | year = 1992 | title = Fast perceptual learning in visual hyperacuity | url = | journal = Science | volume = 256 | issue = | pages = 1018–21 | doi = 10.1126/science.1589770 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar improvements have been found for visual motion discrimination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ball | first1 = K | last2 = Sekuler | first2 = R | year = 1982 | title = A specific and enduring improvement in visual motion discrimination | url = | journal = Science | volume = 218 | issue = 4573| pages = 697–698 | doi = 10.1126/science.7134968 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and orientation sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shiu | first1 = LP | last2 = Pashler | first2 = H | year = 1992 | title = Improvement in line orientation discrimination is retinally local but dependent on cognitive set | url = | journal = Percept Psychophysics | volume = 52 | issue = 5| pages = 582–588 | doi = 10.3758/BF03206720 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vogels | first1 = R | last2 = Orban | first2 = GA | year = 1985 | title = The effect of practice on the oblique effect in line orientation judgments | url = | journal = Vision Res | volume = 25 | issue = 11| pages = 1679–1687 | doi = 10.1016/0042-6989(85)90140-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[visual search]] tasks, observers are asked to find a target object hidden among distractors or in noise. Studies of perceptual [[learning]] with visual search show that experience leads to great gains in sensitivity and speed. In one study by Karni and Sagi,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; the time it took for subjects to search for an oblique line among a field of horizontal lines was found to improve dramatically, from about 200ms in one session to about 50ms in a later session. With appropriate practice, visual search can become automatic and very efficient, such that observers do not need more time to search when there are more items present on the search field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schneider | first1 = W. | last2 = Shiffrin | first2 = R.M. | year = 1977 | title = Controlled and automatic human information processing: I.

===In the natural world===
Perceptual learning is prevalent and occurs continuously in everyday life. As our perceptual system adapts to the natural world, we become better at discriminating between different stimuli when they belong to different categories than when they belong to the same category. We also tend to become less sensitive to the differences between two instances of the same category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldstone | first1 = R.L. | last2 = Hendrickson | first2 = A. | year = 2010 | title = Categorical perception | url = | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 69–78 | doi = 10.1002/wcs.26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These effects are described as the result of [[Category learning|categorical perception]]. Categorical perception effects do not transfer across domains.

In chess, expert chess players encode larger chunks of positions and relations on the board and require fewer exposures to fully recreate a chess board.

In speech phonemes, observers who listen to a continuum of equally spaced consonant-vowel syllables going from /be/ to /de/ are much quicker to indicate that two syllables are different when they belonged to different phonemic categories than when they were two variants of the same phoneme, even when physical differences were equated between each pair of syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liberman | first1 = A.M. | last2 = Harris | first2 = K.S. | last3 = Hoffman | first3 = H.S. | last4 = Griffith | first4 = B.C. | year = 1957 | title = The discrimination of speech sounds within and across phonemes boundaries | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 54 | issue = 5| pages = 358–368 | doi=10.1037/h0044417 | pmid=13481283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief history==
The fact that with huge amounts of practice, individuals can reach impressive perceptual expertise, whether in wine tasting, fabric evaluation or musical preference, has been well acknowledged for centuries, along with the prevalent idiom that "practice makes perfect". The first documented report, dating to the mid-19th century, is the earliest example of tactile training aimed at decreasing the minimal distance at which individuals can discriminate whether one or two points on their skin have been touched. It was found that this distance ([[JND]], Just Noticeable Difference) decreases dramatically with practice, and that this improvement is at least partially retained on subsequent days. Moreover, this improvement is at least partially specific to the trained skin area. A particularly dramatic improvement was found for skin positions at which initial discrimination was very crude (e.g. on the back), though training could not bring the JND of initially crude areas down to that of initially accurate ones (e.g. finger tips).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Volkman | first1 = A. W. | year = 1858 | title = Über den Einfluss der Übung | url = | journal = Leipzig Ber Math-Phys Classe | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 38–69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William James]] devoted a section in his Principles of Psychology (1890/1950) to "the improvement in discrimination by practice".&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=W|year=1890|title=The principles of psychology|volume=I|place=New York|publisher=Dover Publications Inc.|page=509|doi=10.1037/11059-000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted examples and emphasized the importance of perceptual learning for expertise. In 1918, [[Clark L. Hull]], a noted learning theorist, trained human participants to learn to categorize deformed Chinese characters into categories. For each category, he used 6 instances that shared some invariant structural property. People learned to associate a sound as the name of each category, and more importantly, they were able to classify novel characters accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hull|first=C.L.|year=1920|chapter=Quantitative aspects of evolution of concepts|title=Psychological monographs|volume=XXVIII|issue=1.123|pages=1–86|pmc=1362740}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ability to extract invariances from instances and apply them to classify new instances marked this study as a perceptual learning experiment. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:EleanorGibson1.jpg|thumb|Eleanor Gibson]] --&gt;
It was not until 1969, however, that [[Eleanor Gibson]] published her seminal book ''The Principles of Perceptual learning and Development'' and defined the modern field of perceptual learning. She established the study of perceptual learning as an inquiry into the behavior and mechanism of perceptual change. By the mid-1970s, however, this area was in a state of dormancy due to a shift in focus to perceptual and cognitive development in infancy. Much of the scientific community tended to underestimate the impact of learning compared with innate mechanisms. Thus, most of this research focused on characterizing basic perceptual capacities of young infants rather than on perceptual learning processes.

Since the mid-1980s, there has been a new wave of interest in perceptual learning due to findings of cortical plasticity at the lowest sensory levels of sensory systems. Our increased understanding of the physiology and anatomy of our cortical systems has been used to connect the behavioral improvement to the underlying cortical areas. This trend began with earlier findings of [[David H. Hubel|Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel|Wiesel]] that perceptual representations at sensory areas of the cortex are substantially modified during a short ("critical") period immediately following birth. Merzenich, Kaas and colleagues showed that though [[neuroplasticity]] is diminished, it is not eliminated when the critical period ends.&lt;ref name="Merzenich1983"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Merzenich MM, Kaas JH, Wall JT, Sur M, Nelson RJ, Felleman DJ |year=1983 |title=Progression of change following median nerve section in the cortical representation of the hand in areas 3b and 1 in adult owl and squirrel monkeys |journal=Neuroscience |pmid=6646426 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=639–65 |doi=10.1016/0306-4522(83)90208-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when the external pattern of stimulation is substantially modified, neuronal representations in lower-level (e.g. [[primary sensory areas|primary]]) sensory areas are also modified. Research in this period centered on basic sensory discriminations, where remarkable improvements were found on almost any sensory task through discrimination practice. Following training, subjects were tested with novel conditions and learning transfer was assessed. This work departed from earlier work on perceptual learning, which spanned different tasks and levels.

A question still debated today is to what extent improvements from perceptual learning stems from peripheral modifications compared with improvement in higher-level readout stages. Early interpretations, such as that suggested by [[William James]], attributed it to higher-level categorization mechanisms whereby initially blurred differences are gradually associated with distinctively different labels. The work focused on basic sensory discrimination, however, suggests that the effects of perceptual learning are specific to changes in low-levels of the sensory nervous system (i.e., primary sensory cortices).&lt;ref&gt;Fahle Manfred  (Editor), and Tomaso Poggio (Editor), ''Perceptual Learning''. The MIT Press (2002: p. xiv){{ISBN|0262062216}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, research suggest that perceptual learning processes are multilevel and flexible.&lt;ref name ="Petrov"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petrov | first1 = A. A. | last2 = Dosher | first2 = B. A. | last3 = Lu | first3 = Z.-L. | year = 2005 | title = The Dynamics of Perceptual Learning: An Incremental Reweighting Model | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 112 | issue = 4| pages = 715–743 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.112.4.715 | pmid=16262466}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cycles back to the earlier Gibsonian view that low-level learning effects are modulated by high-level factors, and suggests that improvement in information extraction may not involve only low-level sensory coding but also apprehension of relatively abstract structure and relations in time and space.

Within the past decade, researchers have sought a more unified understanding of perceptual learning and worked to apply these principles to improve perceptual learning in applied domains.

==Characteristics==

===Discovery and fluency effects===
Perceptual learning effects can be organized into two broad categories: discovery effects and fluency effects.&lt;ref name ="Kellman2002" /&gt; Discovery effects involve some change in the bases of response such as in selecting new information relevant for the task, amplifying relevant information or suppressing irrelevant information. Experts extract larger "chunks" of information and discover high-order relations and structures in their domains of expertise that are invisible to novices. Fluency effects involve changes in the ease of extraction. Not only can experts process high-order information, they do so with great speed and low [[cognitive load|attentional load]]. Discovery and fluency effects work together so that as the discovery structures becomes more automatic, attentional resources are conserved for discovery of new relations and for high-level thinking and problem-solving.

===The role of attention===
[[William James]] (''Principles of Psychology'', 1890) asserted that "My experience is what I agree to attend to. Only those items which I notice shape my mind - without selective interest, experience is an utter chaos.".&lt;ref name="James" /&gt; His view was extreme, yet its gist was largely supported by subsequent [[behavioral]] and [[physiological]] studies. Mere exposure does not seem to suffice for acquiring expertise.

Indeed, a relevant signal in a given [[behavioral]] condition may be considered noise in another. For example, when presented with two similar stimuli, one might endeavor to study the differences between their representations in order to improve one's ability to discriminate between them, or one may instead concentrate on the similarities to improve one's ability to identify both as belonging to the same category. A specific difference between them could be considered 'signal' in the first case and 'noise' in the second case. Thus, as we adapt to tasks and environments, we pay increasingly more attention to the perceptual features that are relevant and important for the task at hand, and at the same time, less attention to the irrelevant features. This mechanism is called attentional weighting.&lt;ref name ="Petrov" /&gt;

However, recent studies suggest that perceptual learning occurs without selective attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watanabe | first1 = T. | last2 = Nanez | first2 = J.E. | last3 = Sasaki | first3 = Y. | year = 2001 | title = Perceptual learning without perception | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 413 | issue = 6858| pages = 844–848 | doi=10.1038/35101601 | pmid=11677607}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of such task-irrelevant perceptual learning (TIPL) show that the degree of TIPL is similar to that found through direct training procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seitz | first1 =  | last2 = Watanabe | year = 2009 | title = The Phenomenon of Task-Irrelevant Perceptual Learning | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 49 | issue = 21| pages = 2604–2610 | doi=10.1016/j.visres.2009.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; TIPL for a stimulus depends on the relationship between that stimulus and important task events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seitz | first1 =  | last2 = Watanabe | year = 2003 | title = Is subliminal learning really passive? | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 422 | issue = 6927| page = 36 | doi=10.1038/422036a | pmid=12621425}}&lt;/ref&gt; or upon stimulus reward contingencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seitz | first1 = Kim | last2 = Watanabe | year = 2009 | title = Rewards Evoke Learning of Unconsciously Processed Visual Stimuli in Adult Humans | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 61 | issue = | pages = 700–7 | doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2009.01.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has thus been suggested that learning (of task irrelevant stimuli) is contingent upon spatially diffusive learning signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seitz | first1 =  | last2 = Watanabe | year = 2005 | title = A unified model of task-irrelevant and task-relevant perceptual learning | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 9 | issue = 7 | pages = 329–334 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2005.05.010 | pmid = 15955722}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar effects, but upon a shorter time scale, have been found for memory processes and  in some cases is called attentional boosting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swallow|first1=KM|last2=Jiang|first2=YV|title=The Attentional Boost Effect: Transient increases in attention to one task enhance performance in a second task.|journal=Cognition|date=April 2010|volume=115|issue=1|pages=118–32|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2009.12.003|pmid=20080232|pmc=2830300}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when an important (alerting) event occurs, learning may also affect concurrent, non-attended and non-salient stimuli.&lt;ref name="Jiang2001"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Y Jiang |author2=MM Chun |year=2001|title=Selective attention modulates implicit learning |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology A |citeseerx = 10.1.1.24.8668 |doi=10.1080/713756001 |pmid=11765735 |volume=54 |pages=1105–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time course of perceptual learning===
The time course of perceptual [[learning]] varies from one participant to another.&lt;ref name="Wong, Peters, Goldreich" /&gt; Perceptual learning occurs not only within the first training session but also between sessions.&lt;ref name="Karni, A. 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karni | first1 = A. | last2 = Sagi | first2 = D. | year = 1993 | title = The time course of learning a visual skill | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 365 | issue = 6443| pages = 250–252 | doi = 10.1038/365250a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fast learning (i.e., within-first-session learning) and slow learning (i.e., between-session learning) involves different changes in the human adult [[brain]]. While the fast learning effects can only be retained for a short term of several days, the slow [[learning]] effects can be preserved for a long term over several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Qu | first1 = Z.

==Explanations and Models==

===Receptive field modification===
Research on basic [[Sense|sensory]] discriminations often show that perceptual [[learning]] effects are specific to the trained task or [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]].&lt;ref&gt;Fahle, M., Poggio, T. (2002) Perceptual learning. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers take this to suggest that perceptual learning may work by modifying the [[receptive field]]s of the cells (e.g., [[visual cortex|V1]] and V2 cells) that initially encode the stimulus. For example, individual cells could adapt to become more sensitive to important features, effectively recruiting more cells for a particular purpose, making some cells more specifically tuned for the task at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fahle | first1 = M. | last2 = Edelman | first2 = S. | year = 1993 | title = Long-term learning in vernier acuity: Effects of stimulus orientation, range and of feedback | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 397–412 | doi=10.1016/0042-6989(93)90094-d}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for receptive field change has been found using single-cell recording techniques in [[primates]] in both tactile and auditory domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Recanzone | first1 = G.H. | last2 = Schreiner | first2 = C.E. | last3 = Merzenich | first3 = M.M. | year = 1993 | title = Plasticity in the frequency representation of primary auditory cortex following discrimination training in adult owl monkeys | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 87–103 | pmid = 8423485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all perceptual [[learning]] tasks are specific to the trained stimuli or tasks. Sireteanu and Rettenback&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leonards | first1 = U. | last2 = Rettenback | first2 = R. | last3 = Nase | first3 = G. | last4 = Sireteanu | first4 = R. | year = 2002 | title = Perceptual learning of highly demanding visual search tasks | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 42 | issue = 18| pages = 2193–204 | doi=10.1016/s0042-6989(02)00134-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; discussed discrimination learning effects that generalize across eyes, retinal locations and tasks. Ahissar and Hochstein&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ahissar | first1 = M. | last2 = Hochstein | first2 = S. | year = 2000 | title = Learning pop-out detection: The spread of attention and learning in feature search: effects of target distribution and task difficulty | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 1349–64 | doi=10.1016/s0042-6989(00)00002-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; used visual search to show that learning to detect a single line element hidden in an array of differently-oriented line segments could generalize to positions at which the target was never presented. In human vision, not enough receptive field modification has been found in early visual areas to explain perceptual learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schoups | first1 = A. | last2 = Vogels | first2 = R. | last3 = Qian | first3 = N. | last4 = Orban | first4 = G. | year = 2001 | title = Practising orientation identification improves orientation coding in V1 neurons | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 412 | issue = 6846| pages = 549–53 | doi=10.1038/35087601 | pmid=11484056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training that produces large behavioral changes such as improvements in discrimination does not produce changes in receptive fields. In studies where changes have been found, the changes are too small to explain changes in behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ghose | first1 = G.M. | last2 = Yang | first2 = T. | last3 = Maunsell | first3 = J.H. | year = 2002 | title = Physiological correlates of perceptual learning in monkey v1 and v2 | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | volume = 87 | issue = 4 | pages = 1867–88 | doi = 10.1152/jn.00690.2001 | pmid = 11929908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reverse hierarchy theory===
The Reverse Hierarchy Theory (RHT), proposed by Ahissar &amp; Hochstein, aims to link between learning dynamics and specificity and the underlying neuronal sites.&lt;ref name="RHT2004"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=M. Ahissar |author2=S. Hochstein |year=2004 |pages=457–64 |title=The reverse hierarchy theory of visual perceptual learning |volume=8|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2004.08.011 |pmid=15450510 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; RHT proposes that naïve performance is based on responses at high-level cortical areas, where crude, categorical level representations of the environment are represented. Hence initial learning stages involve understanding global aspects of the task. Subsequent practice may yield better perceptual resolution as a consequence of accessing lower-level information via the feedback connections going from high to low levels. Accessing the relevant low-level representations requires a backward search during which informative input populations of neurons in the low level are allocated. Hence, subsequent learning and its specificity reflect the resolution of lower levels. RHT thus proposes that initial performance is limited by the high-level resolution whereas post-training performance is limited by the resolution at low levels. Since high-level representations of different individuals differ due to their prior experience, their initial learning patterns may differ. Several imaging studies are in line with this interpretation, finding that initial performance is correlated with average (BOLD) responses at higher-level areas whereas subsequent performance is more correlated with activity at lower-level areas{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}. RHT proposes that modifications at low levels will occur only when the backward search (from high to low levels of processing) is successful. Such success requires that the backward search will "know" which neurons in the lower level are informative. This "knowledge" is gained by training repeatedly on a limited set of stimuli, such that the same lower-level neuronal populations are informative during several trials. Recent studies found that mixing a broad range of stimuli may also yield effective learning if these stimuli are clearly perceived as different, or are explicitly tagged as different. These findings further support the requirement for top-down guidance in order to obtain effective learning.

===Enrichment versus differentiation===
In some complex perceptual tasks, all [[human]]s are experts. We are all very sophisticated, but not infallible at scene identification, face identification and speech [[perception]]. Traditional explanations attribute this expertise to some holistic, somewhat specialized, mechanisms. Perhaps such quick identifications are achieved by more specific and complex perceptual detectors which gradually "chunk" (i.e., unitize) features that tend to concur, making it easier to pull a whole set of information. Whether any concurrence of features can gradually be chunked with practice or chunking can only be obtained with some pre-disposition (e.g. faces, phonological categories) is an open question. Current findings suggest that such expertise is correlated with a significant increase in the cortical volume involved in these processes. Thus, we all have somewhat specialized face areas, which may reveal an innate property, but we also develop somewhat specialized areas for written words as opposed to single letters or strings of letter-like symbols. Moreover, special experts in a given domain have larger cortical areas involved in that domain. Thus, expert musicians have larger auditory areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Draganski | first1 = B | last2 = May | first2 = A | year = 2008 | title = Training-induced structural changes in the adult human brain | url = | journal = Behav Brain Res | volume = 192 | issue = | pages = 137–142 | doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2008.02.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These observations are in line with traditional theories of enrichment proposing that improved performance involves an increase in cortical representation. For this expertise, basic categorical identification may be based on enriched and detailed representations, located to some extent in specialized brain areas. [[Physiological]] evidence suggests that training for refined discrimination along basic dimensions (e.g. frequency in the auditory modality) also increases the representation of the trained parameters, though in these cases the increase may mainly involve lower-level sensory areas.&lt;ref name = "Gibson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gibson | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Gibson | first2 = E.J. | year = 1955 | title = Perceptual learning: Differentiation or enrichment? | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 32–41 | doi=10.1037/h0048826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selective reweighting===
In 2005, Petrov, Dosher and Lu pointed out that perceptual [[learning]] may be explained in terms of the selection of which analyzers best perform the classification, even in simple discrimination tasks. They explain that the some part of the neural system responsible for particular decisions have specificity, while low-level perceptual units do not.&lt;ref name ="Petrov" /&gt; In their model, encodings at the lowest level do not change. Rather, changes that occur in perceptual learning arise from changes in higher-level, abstract representations of the relevant stimuli. Because specificity can come from differentially selecting information, this "selective reweighting theory" allows for learning of complex, abstract representation. This corresponds to Gibson's earlier account of perceptual learning as selection and [[learning]] of distinguishing features. Selection may be the unifying principles of perceptual learning at all levels.&lt;ref name ="KellmanGarrigan2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kellman | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Garrigan | first2 = P. | year = 2009 | title = Perceptual learning and human expertise | url = | journal = Physics of Life Reviews | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 53–84 | doi =  10.1016/j.plrev.2008.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The impact of training protocol and the dynamics of learning==
[[Ivan Pavlov]] discovered [[classical conditioning|conditioning]]. He found that when a stimulus (e.g. sound) is immediately followed by food several times, the mere presentation of this stimulus would subsequently elicit saliva in a dog's mouth. He further found that when he used a differential protocol, by consistently presenting food after one stimulus while not presenting food after another stimulus, dogs were quickly conditioned to selectively salivate in response to the rewarded one. He then asked whether this protocol could be used to increase perceptual discrimination, by differentially rewarding two very similar stimuli (e.g. tones with similar frequency). However, he found that differential conditioning was not effective.

Pavlov's studies were followed by many training studies which found that an effective way to increase perceptual resolution is to begin with a large difference along the required dimension and gradually proceed to small differences along this dimension. This easy-to-difficult transfer was termed "transfer along a continuum".

These studies showed that the dynamics of learning depend on the training protocol, rather than on the total amount of practice. Moreover, it seems that the strategy implicitly chosen for learning is highly sensitive to the choice of the first few trials during which the system tries to identify the relevant cues.

===Consolidation and sleep===
Several studies asked whether [[learning]] takes place during practice sessions or in between, for example, during subsequent sleep. The dynamics of [[learning]] are hard to evaluate since the directly measured parameter is performance, which is affected by both [[learning]], inducing improvement, and fatigue, which hampers performance. Current studies suggest that sleep contributes to improved and durable [[learning]] effects, by further strengthening connections in the absence of continued practice.&lt;ref name="Karni, A. 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stickgold | first1 = R. | last2 = LaTanya | first2 = J. | last3 = Hobson | first3 = J.A. | year = 2000 | title = Visual discrimination learning requires sleep after training | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 3 | issue = 12| pages = 1237–1238 | doi = 10.1038/81756 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Shiu"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shiu | first1 = L. | last2 = Pashler | first2 = H. | year = 1992 | title = Improvement in line orientation discrimination is retinally local but dependent on cognitive set | url = | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 582–588 | doi=10.3758/bf03206720}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[slow-wave sleep|slow-wave]] and [[REM sleep|REM]] (rapid eye movement) stages of sleep may contribute to this process, via not-yet-understood mechanisms.

===Comparison and contrast===
Practice with comparison and contrast of instances that belong to the same or different categories allow for the pick-up of the distinguishing features—features that are important for the classification task—and the filter of the irrelevant features.&lt;ref name="GibsonEleanor"&gt;Gibson, Eleanor (1969) Principles of Perceptual Learning and Development. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt;

===Task difficulty===
[[Learning]] easy examples first may lead to better transfer and better [[learning]] of more difficult cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ahissar | first1 = M. | last2 = Hochstein | first2 = S. | year = 1997 | title = Task difficulty and [[learning]] specificity | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 387 | issue = | pages = 401–406 | doi = 10.1038/387401a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
By recording ERPs from human adults, Ding and Colleagues investigated the influence of task difficulty on the brain mechanisms of visual perceptual learning. Results showed that difficult task training affected earlier visual processing stage and broader visual cortical regions than easy task training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Y. | last2 = Song | first2 = Y. | last3 = Qu | first3 = Z. | last4 = Ding | first4 = Y.L. | year = 2010 | title = Task difficulty modulates electrophysiological correlates of perceptual learning | url = | journal = International Journal of Psychophysiology | volume = 75 | issue = | pages = 234–240 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2009.11.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Active classification and attention===
Active classification effort and attention are often necessary to produce perceptual learning effects.&lt;ref name="Shiu"/&gt; However, in some cases, mere exposure to certain stimulus variations can produce improved discriminations.

===Feedback===
In many cases, perceptual learning does not require feedback (whether or not the classification is correct).&lt;ref name = "Gibson" /&gt; Other studies suggest that block feedback (feedback only after a block of trials) produces more learning effects than no feedback at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herzog | first1 = M.H. | last2 = Fahle | first2 = M. | year = 1998 | title = Modeling perceptual learning: Difficulties and how they can be overcome | url = | journal = Biological Cybernetics | volume = 78 | issue = 2| pages = 107–117 | doi = 10.1007/s004220050418 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limits===
Despite the marked perceptual learning demonstrated in different sensory systems and under varied training paradigms, it is clear that perceptual learning must face certain unsurpassable limits imposed by the physical characteristics of the sensory system. For instance, in tactile spatial acuity tasks, experiments suggest that the extent of learning is limited by fingertip surface area, which may constrain the underlying density of [[mechanoreceptor]]s.&lt;ref name="Wong, Peters, Goldreich" /&gt;

==Relations to other forms of learning==

===Declarative &amp; procedural learning===
In many domains of expertise in the real world, perceptual learning interacts with other forms of learning. [[Declarative learning|Declarative knowledge]] tends to occur with perceptual learning. As we learn to distinguish between an array of wine flavors, we also develop a wide range of vocabularies to describe the intricacy of each flavor.

Similarly, perceptual learning also interacts flexibly with [[procedural knowledge]]. For example, the perceptual expertise of a baseball player at bat can detect early in the ball's flight whether the pitcher threw a curveball. However, the perceptual differentiation of the feel of swinging the bat in various ways may also have been involved in learning the motor commands that produce the required swing.&lt;ref name ="Kellman2002"/&gt;

===Implicit learning===
Perceptual [[learning]] is often said to be [[implicit learning|implicit]], such that [[learning]] occurs without awareness. It is not at all clear whether perceptual [[learning]] is always implicit. Changes in sensitivity that arise are often not conscious and do not involve conscious procedures, but perceptual information can be mapped onto various responses.&lt;ref name ="Kellman2002" /&gt;

In complex perceptual learning tasks (e.g., sorting of newborn chicks by sex, playing chess), experts are often unable to explain what stimulus relationships they are using in classification. However, in less complex perceptual [[learning]] tasks, people can point out what information they're using to make classifications.

==Applications==

===Improving perceptual skills===
An important potential application of perceptual [[learning]] is the acquisition of skill for practical purposes. Thus it is important to understand whether training for increased resolution in lab conditions induces a general upgrade which transfers to other environmental contexts, or results from mechanisms which are context specific. Improving complex skills is typically gained by training under complex simulation conditions rather than one component at a time. Recent lab-based training protocols with complex action computer games have shown that such practice indeed modifies [[visual]] skills in a general way, which transfers to new visual contexts. In 2010, Achtman, Green, and Bavelier reviewed the research on video games to train visual skills.&lt;ref name="RHT2008"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=R.L. Achtman |author2=C.S. Green |author3=D.

(2006) The Cognitive Neuroscience of Video Games. In: Messaris P, Humphrey L, editors. Digital Media: Transformations in Human Communication. New York: Peter Lang&lt;/ref&gt; on using video games to enhance perceptual and cognitive abilities. A variety of skills were upgraded in video game players, including "improved hand-eye coordination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Griffith | first1 = J.L. | last2 = Voloschin | first2 = P. | last3 = Gibb | first3 = G.D. | last4 = Bailey | first4 = J.R. | year = 1983 | title = Differences in eye-hand motor coordination of video-game users and non-users | url = | journal = Percept Mot Skills | volume = 57 | issue = 1| pages = 155–158 | doi = 10.2466/pms.1983.57.1.155 }}&lt;/ref&gt; increased processing in the periphery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Green | first1 = C.S. | last2 = Bavelier | first2 = D. | year = 2006 | title = Effect of action video games on the spatial distribution of visuospatial attention | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance | volume = 32 | issue = 6| pages = 1465–1478 | doi = 10.1037/0096-1523.32.6.1465 | pmid=17154785 | pmc=2896828}}&lt;/ref&gt; enhanced mental rotation skills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sims | first1 = V.K. | last2 = Mayer | first2 = R.E. | year = 2000 | title = Domain specificity of spatial expertise: The case of video game players | url = | journal = Applied Cognitive Psychology | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 97–115 | doi = 10.1002/acp.759 }}&lt;/ref&gt; greater divided attention abilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenfield | first1 = P.M. | last2 = DeWinstanley | first2 = P. | last3 = Kilpatrick | first3 = H. | last4 = Kaye | first4 = D. | year = 1994 | title = Action video games and informal education: effects on strategies for dividing visual attention | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Devevelopmental Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 105–123 | doi = 10.1016/0193-3973(94)90008-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and faster reaction times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Castel | first1 = A.D. | last2 = Pratt | first2 = J. | last3 = Drummond | first3 = E. | year = 2005 | title = The effects of action video game experience on the time course of inhibition of return and the efficiency of visual search | url = | journal = Ada Psychol (Amst) | volume = 119 | issue = 2| pages = 217–230 | doi = 10.1016/j.actpsy.2005.02.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to name a few". An important characteristic is the functional increase in the size of the effective visual field (within which viewers can identify objects), which is trained in action games and transfers to new settings. Whether learning of simple discriminations, which are trained in separation, transfers to new stimulus contexts (e.g. complex stimulus conditions) is still an open question.

Like experimental procedures, other attempts to apply perceptual [[learning]] methods to basic and complex skills use training situations in which the learner receives many short classification trials. Tallal, Merzenich and their colleagues have successfully adapted auditory discrimination paradigms to address speech and language difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Merzenich | last2 = Jenkins | first2 = W.M. | last3 = Johnstone | first3 = P. | last4 = Schreiner | first4 = C. | last5 = Miller | first5 = S. | last6 = Tallal | first6 = P. | year = 1996 | title = Temporal processing deficits of language impaired children ameliorated by training | url = | journal = Science | volume = 271 | issue = 5245| pages = 77–81 | doi = 10.1126/science.271.5245.77 | pmid=8539603}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tallal | first1 = P. | last2 = Merzenich | first2 = M. | last3 = Miller | first3 = S. | last4 = Jenkins | first4 = W. | year = 1998 | title = Language learning impairment: Integrating research and remediation | url = | journal = [[Scandinavian Journal of Psychology]] | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 197–199 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9450.393079 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They reported improvements in language learning-impaired children using specially enhanced and extended speech signals. The results applied not only to auditory discrimination performance but speech and language comprehension as well.

===Technologies for perceptual learning===
In educational domains, recent efforts by [[Philip Kellman]] and colleagues showed that perceptual learning can be systematically produced and accelerated using specific, computer-based technology. Their approach to perceptual learning methods take the form of perceptual learning modules (PLMs): sets of short, interactive trials that develop, in a particular domain, learners' pattern recognition, classification abilities, and their abilities to map across multiple representations. As a result of practice with mapping across transformations (e.g., algebra, fractions) and across multiple representations (e.g., graphs, equations, and word problems), students show dramatic gains in their structure recognition in fraction learning and algebra. They also demonstrated that when students practice classifying algebraic transformations using PLMs, the results show remarkable improvements in fluency at algebra problem solving.&lt;ref name="KellmanGarrigan2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kellman | first1 = P.

Similar results have also been replicated in other domains with PLMs, including anatomic recognition in medical and surgical training,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guerlain | first1 = S. | last2 = La Follette | first2 = M. | last3 = Mersch | first3 = T.C. | last4 = Mitchell | first4 = B.A. | last5 = Poole | first5 = G.R. | last6 = Calland | first6 = J.F. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2004 | title = Improving surgical pattern recognition through repetitive viewing of video clips | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetic – Part A: Systems and Humans | volume = 34 | issue = 6| pages = 699–707 | doi=10.1109/tsmca.2004.836793}}&lt;/ref&gt; reading instrumental flight displays,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kellman | first1 = P.J. | last2 = Kaiser | first2 = M.K. | year = 1994 | title = Extracting object motion during observer motion: Combining constraints from optic flow and binocular disparity | url = | journal = Journal of the Optical Society of America, A, Optics, Image Science and Vision | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 623–5 | doi = 10.1364/JOSAA.12.000623 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and apprehending molecular structures in chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Wise, J., Kubose, T., Chang, N., Russell, A., &amp; Kellman, P.

Pluralistic ignorance may help to explain the [[bystander effect]].&lt;ref name="kitts2003"/&gt; If no-one acts, onlookers may believe others believe action is incorrect, and may therefore themselves refrain from acting.

==Research==
[[Deborah Prentice|Prentice]] and Miller found that, on average, private levels of comfort with drinking practices on campus were much lower than the perceived average. In the case of men, they found a shifting of private attitudes toward this perceived norm, a form of [[cognitive dissonance]]. Women, on the other hand, were found to have an increased sense of alienation on the campus but lacked the attitude change detected in men, presumably because norms related to alcohol consumption on campus are much more central for men than for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prentice|first1=Deborah A.|last2=Miller|first2=Dale T.|title=Pluralistic ignorance and alcohol use on campus: Some consequences of misperceiving the social norm.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1993|volume=64|issue=2|pages=243–256|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.2.243|pmid=8433272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that pluralistic ignorance plagues not only those who indulge, but also those who abstain: from gambling, smoking and drinking and among some who follow vegetarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schanck|first1=Richard Louis|title=A study of a community and its groups and institutions conceived of as behaviors of individuals.|journal=Psychological Monographs|date=1932|volume=43|issue=2|pages=i–133|doi=10.1037/h0093296}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter has found that pluralistic ignorance can be caused by the structure of the underlying social network, not cognitive dissonance.

The theory of pluralistic ignorance was studied by [[Floyd Henry Allport]] and his students [[Daniel Katz (psychologist)|Daniel Katz]] and [[Richard Schanck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Gorman |first1=Hubert J. |title=The discovery of pluralistic ignorance: An ironic lesson |journal=Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences |date=October 1986 |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=333-347 |doi=10.1002/1520-6696(198610)22:4&lt;333::AID-JHBS2300220405&gt;3.0.CO;2-X |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He produced studies of racial stereotyping and prejudice, and attitude change, and his pursuit of the connections between individual psychology and social systems helped to found the field of [[Industrial and organizational psychology|organizational psychology]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} [[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]], in her [[spiral of silence]] theory, argued that media biases lead to pluralistic ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;Noelle-Neumann, Elisabeth (1993) ''The Spiral of Silence: Public Opinion – Our Social Skin'' (2nd ed.). Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Pluralistic ignorance was blamed for exacerbating support for [[racial segregation in the United States]]. It has also been named a reason for the illusory popular support that kept the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in power, as many opposed the regime but assumed that others were supporters of it. Thus, most people were afraid to voice their opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Gorman|first1=Hubert J.|title=Pluralistic Ignorance and White Estimates of White Support for Racial Segregation|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|date=1975|volume=39|issue=3|pages=313|doi=10.1086/268231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another case of pluralistic ignorance concerns drinking on campus in countries where alcohol use is prevalent at colleges and universities. Students drink at weekend parties and sometimes at evening study breaks. Many drink to excess, some on a routine basis. The high visibility of heavy drinking on campus, combined with reluctance by students to show any public signs of concern or disapproval, gives rise to pluralistic ignorance: Students believe that their peers are much more comfortable with this behavior than they themselves feel.&lt;ref name="Berkowitz chapter"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=TL |last2=Laker |first2=J |title=How College Men Feel about Being Men and "Doing the Right Thing." |publisher=Routledge, Kegan &amp; Paul Publishers |location=Masculinities in Higher Education: Theoretical and Practical Implications. |pages=Ch. 10 |url=http://alanberkowitz.com/articles/college_men.pdf |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s fairy tale  "[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]"&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, H.C. (1837). Andersen's Fairy Tales. Children's Classics.&lt;/ref&gt; is a famous fictional case of pluralistic ignorance. In this story two con artists come into the Emperor's kingdom and convince him that they make the finest clothes in all of the land that can only be seen by anyone who was not stupid. The con artists continued to steal gold, silk and other precious items for their "unique creation". Out of fear for being seen as stupid, all of the emperor's men and townspeople kept silent about the fact they could not see the emperor's clothes until finally a small child comes forth and says that the emperor isn't wearing any clothes. Once the child is willing to admit that he cannot see any clothes on the emperor, the emperor and townspeople finally admit that the emperor has been tricked and that there was never an outfit being made.

Pluralistic ignorance has also been blamed for large majorities of the public remaining silent on climate change — while 'solid majorities' of the American and UK public are concerned about climate change, most erroneously believe they are in the minority with their concern.&lt;ref name="Climate of Silence"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Geiger |first1=Nathaniel |last2=Swim |first2=Janet K |title=Climate of silence: Pluralistic ignorance as a barrier to climate change discussion |journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology |date=September 2016 |volume=47 |pages=79-90 |doi=10.1016/j.jenvp.2016.05.002 |url=https://climateaccess.org/sites/default/files/Climate%20of%20silence-%20Pluralistic%20ignorance%20as%20a%20barrier%20tClimate%20of%20silence-%20Pluralistic%20ignorance%20as%20a%20barrier%20to%20climate%20change%20discussiono%20climate%20change%20discussion.pdf |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's been suggested that pollution-intensive industries have contributed to the public's underestimation of public support for climate solutions.&lt;ref name="Second-Order Opinions for Climate Politics"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mildenberger |first1=Matto |last2=Tingley |first2=Dustin |title=Beliefs about Climate Beliefs: The Importance of Second-Order Opinions for Climate Politics |journal=British journal of political science |date=December 2017 |pages=1-29 |doi=10.1017/S0007123417000321 |url=https://climateadvocacylab.org/system/files/mildenbergertingley_bjps.pdf |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the U.S., support for pollution pricing is high,&lt;ref name="Politics and Global Warming, March 2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Leiserowitz |first1=A |last2=Maibach |first2=E |last3=Roser-Renouf |first3=C |last4=Cutler |first4=M |last5=Kotcher |first5=J |title=Politics and Global Warming, March 2018 |url=http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf |publisher=Yale University and George Mason University |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yale Climate Opinion Maps"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marlon |first1=Jennifer |last2=Howe |first2=Peter |last3=Mildenberger |first3=Matto |last4=Leiserowitz |first4=Anthony |last5=Wang |first5=Xinran |title=Yale Climate Opinion Maps 2018 |url=http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2018/?est=reducetax&amp;type=value&amp;geo=cd |website=Yale Program on Climate Change Communication |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet public perception of public support is much lower.&lt;ref name="Second-Order Opinions for Climate Politics"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mildenberger |first1=Matto |last2=Tingley |first2=Dustin |title=Beliefs about Climate Beliefs: The Importance of Second-Order Opinions for Climate Politics |journal=British journal of political science |date=December 2017 |pages=1-29 |doi=10.1017/S0007123417000321 |url=https://climateadvocacylab.org/system/files/mildenbergertingley_bjps.pdf |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some{{who|date=November 2018}} will argue that pluralistic ignorance is why public concern for climate change exists at all.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Men's conceptions of how they are expected to conform to norms of masculinity present additional examples of pluralistic ignorance. Specifically, most men are uncomfortable with other men "bragging about sexual acts and giving details," but erroneously believe themselves to be in the minority for their discomfort. Similarly, men underestimate other men's "desire to make sure they have consent when sexually active." This "role-conflict" can have deleterious consequences for men's physical and mental health, as well as for society.&lt;ref name="Berkowitz chapter"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=TL |last2=Laker |first2=J |title=How College Men Feel about Being Men and "Doing the Right Thing." |publisher=Routledge, Kegan &amp; Paul Publishers |location=Masculinities in Higher Education: Theoretical and Practical Implications. |pages=Ch. 10 |url=http://alanberkowitz.com/articles/college_men.pdf |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Pluralistic ignorance has been linked to a wide range of deleterious consequences. For example, victims of pluralistic ignorance see themselves as deviant members of their peer group: less knowledgeable than their classmates, more uptight than their peers, less committed than their fellow board members, less competent than their fellow nurses (see the [[Dunning&amp;ndash;Kruger effect]] operating in the opposite direction). This can leave them feeling bad about themselves and alienated from the group or institution of which they are a part. In addition, pluralistic ignorance can lead groups to persist in policies and practices that have lost widespread support: This can lead college students to persist in heavy drinking, corporations to persist in failing strategies, and governments to persist in unpopular foreign policies. At the same time, it can prevent groups from taking actions that would be beneficial in the long run: actions to intervene in an emergency, for example, or to initiate a personal relationship.

Pluralistic ignorance can be dispelled, and its negative consequences alleviated, through education. For example, students who learn that support for heavy drinking practices is not as widespread as they thought drink less themselves and feel more comfortable with the decision not to drink. Alcohol intervention programs now routinely employ this strategy to combat problem drinking on campus.&lt;ref name="Prentice"&gt;Prentice, D. (2007). Pluralistic ignorance. In Encyclopedia of Social Psychology. Sage Publishing Retrieved from http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/socialpsychology/n402.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misconceptions==
Pluralistic ignorance can be contrasted with the [[false consensus effect]]. In pluralistic ignorance, people privately disdain but publicly support a norm (or a belief), while the false consensus effect causes people to wrongly assume that most people think like they do, while in reality most people do not think like they do (and express the disagreement openly). For instance, pluralistic ignorance may lead a student to drink alcohol excessively because she believes that everyone else does that, while in reality everyone else also wishes they could avoid binge drinking, but no one expresses that due to the fear of being ostracized.&lt;ref name="kitts2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kitts|first1=James A.|title=Egocentric Bias or Information Management? Selective Disclosure and the Social Roots of Norm Misperception|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|date=September 2003|volume=66|issue=3|pages=222|doi=10.2307/1519823}}&lt;/ref&gt; A false consensus for the same situation would mean that the student believes that most other people do not enjoy excessive drinking, while in fact most other people do enjoy that and openly express their opinion about it. 

A study done by Greene, House, and Ross used simple circumstantial questionnaires on Stanford undergrads to gather info on FCE. They compiled thoughts on the choice they felt people would or should make, considering traits such as shyness, cooperativeness, trust, and adventurousness. Studies found that when explaining their decisions, participants gaged choices based on what they explained as "people in general" and their idea of "typical" answers. For each of the stories those subjects said that they personally would follow a given behavioral alternative also tended to rate that alternative as relatively probable for "people in general": those subjects who claimed that they would reject the alternative tended to rate it as relatively improbable for "people in general". It was evident that the influence of the subjects' own behavior choice affected the estimates of commonness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=Lee|last2=Greene|first2=David|last3=House|first3=Pamela|title=The "false consensus effect": An egocentric bias in social perception and attribution processes|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=May 1977|volume=13|issue=3|pages=279–301|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(77)90049-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it would seem as if the two are built on the same premise of social norms, they take two very oppositional stances on a similar phenomenon. The false consensus effect considers that in predicting an outcome, people will assume that the masses agree with their opinion and think the same way they do on an issue, whereas the opposite is true of pluralistic ignorance, where the individual does not agree with a certain action but go along with it anyway, believing that their view is not shared with the masses (which is usually untrue).

'''Representational systems''' (also known{{by whom|date=September 2017}} as '''sensory modalities'''{{cn|date=September 2017}} and abbreviated{{by whom|date=September 2017}} to '''VAKOG'''{{cn|date=September 2017}} or known{{by whom|date=September 2017}} as the '''4-tuple'''{{cn|date=September 2017}}) is a postulated model from [[neuro-linguistic programming]],{{cn|date=September 2017}} a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]&lt;ref name="Thyer"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Pseudoscience in Social Work Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nE9FCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA166&amp;vq=nlp&amp;pg=PA166#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|date=2015-05-15|isbn=9780826177698|first1=Bruce A.|last1=Thyer|first2=Monica G.|last2=Pignotti|pages=56–57, 165–167|quote=As NLP became more popular, some research was conducted and reviews of such research have concluded that there is no scientific basis for its methods about representational systems and eye movements.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharpley 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Sharpley|first= Christopher F.|title= Research findings on neurolinguistic programming: Nonsupportive data or an untestable theory?|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=1 January 1987|volume=34|issue=1|pages=103–107|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.34.1.103}}&lt;/ref&gt; collection of models and methods regarding how the human [[mind]] processes and stores [[information]]. The central idea of this model is that experience is represented in the mind in sensorial terms, i.e. in terms of the putative five senses, qualia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bandler | first=Richard | last2=Grinder | first2=John | title=The Structure of Magic II | year=1976 | publisher=Science and behavior Books Inc. | isbn=0831400498 | pages=6–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}

According to Bandler and Grinder our chosen words, phrases and sentences are indicative of our referencing of each of the representational systems.&lt;ref name="Bandler 1976 7"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bandler | first=Richard | last2=Grinder | first2=John | title=The Structure of Magic II | year=1976 | publisher=Science and behavior Books Inc. | isbn=0831400498 | page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}} So for example the words "black", "clear", "spiral" and "image" reference the ''visual'' representation system; similarly the words "tinkling", "silent", "squeal" and "blast" reference the ''auditory'' representation system.&lt;ref name="Bandler 1976 7"/&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}  Bandler and Grinder also propose that ostensibly metaphorical or figurative language indicates a reference to a representational system such that it is actually ''literal''.  For example, the comment "I see what you're saying" is taken to indicate a visual representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bandler | first=Richard | last2=Grinder | first2=John | title=The Structure of Magic II | year=1976 | publisher=Science and behavior Books Inc. | isbn=0831400498 | page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}

Further, Bandler and Grinder claim that each person has a "most highly valued" (now commonly termed ''preferred'') representational system in which they are more able to vividly create an experience (in their mind) in terms of that representational system, tend to use that representational system more often than the others, and have more distinctions available in that representation system than the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bandler | first=Richard | last2=Grinder | first2=John | title=The Structure of Magic II | year=1976 | publisher=Science and behavior Books Inc. | isbn=0831400498 | page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}  So for example a person that most highly values their visual representation system is able to easily and vividly visualise things and has a tendency to do so in preference to creating or recreating an experience in terms of the other representational system.

Representational systems are one of the foundational ideas of NLP and form the basis of many NLP techniques and methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bandler | first=Richard | last2=Grinder | first2=John | title=The Structure of Magic II | year=1976 | publisher=Science and behavior Books Inc. | isbn=0831400498 | pages=13–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}

==Representational systems within NLP==

{{quotation|"At the core of NLP is the belief that, when people are engaged in activities, they are also making use of a representational system; that is, they are using some internal representation of the materials they are involved with, such as a conversation, a rifle shot, a spelling task. These representations can be visual, auditory, kinesthetic, or involve the other senses. In addition, a person may be creating a representation or recalling one. For example, a person asked to spell a word may visualize that word printed on a piece of paper, may hear it being sounded out, or may construct the spelling from the application of a series of logical rules." Daniel Druckman (Ed.) (1988), ''Enhancing Human Performance: Issues, Theories, and Techniques''(pp.138-139)&lt;ref name="druckman"&gt;Druckman (1988), ''Enhancing Human Performance: Issues, Theories, and Techniques''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For many practical purposes, according to NLP,{{who|date=September 2017}} mental processing of events and memories can be treated as if performed by the five senses. For example, [[Einstein]] credited his discovery of [[special relativity]] to a mental visualization strategy of "sitting on the end of a ray of light", and many people as part of decision-making ''talk to themselves'' in their heads.{{synth|date=September 2017}}

The manner in which this is done, and the effectiveness of the [[strategy (NLP)|mental strategy]] employed, is stated by NLP{{by whom|date=September 2017}} to play a critical part in the way mental processing takes place. This observation led to the concept of a ''preferred'' representational system,{{cn|date=September 2017}} the classification of people into fixed ''visual'', ''auditory'' or ''kinesthetic'' [[stereotype]]s. This idea was later discredited{{by whom|date=September 2017}} and dropped within NLP by the early 1980s,{{cn|date=September 2017}} in favor of the understanding that most people use all of their senses (whether consciously or unconsciously), and that whilst one system may seem to dominate, this is often contextualized - globally there is a balance that dynamically varies according to circumstance and mood.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}

NLP{{who|date=September 2017}} asserts that for most circumstances and most people, three of the five sensory based modes seem to dominate in mental processing:
* ''[[visual thinking|visual]]'' thoughts - sight, mental imagery, spatial awareness
* ''auditory'' (or linguistic) thoughts - sound, speech, dialog, white noise
* ''kinesthetic'' (or [[proprioception|proprioceptive]]) sense - [[Somatosensory system|somatic]] feelings in the body, temperature, pressure, and also emotion.
The other two senses, gustatory (taste) and olfactory (smell), which are closely associated,  often seem to be less significant in general mental processing, and are often considered jointly as one.

For this reason, one often sees the term ''VAK'' in NLP reference texts,{{cn|date=September 2017}} to signify these three primary representational systems, as well as the term ''4-[[tuple]]'' (or ''VAKOG''){{cn|date=September 2017}} if the author wishes to include all senses including taste/smell. The same term is also known as ''First Access'' (John Grinder),&lt;ref name="whispering"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Grinder, John  |author2=Carmen Bostic St Clair  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Whispering in the Wind  | location=CA | publisher=J &amp; C Enterprises | year=2001 | pages=127, 171, 222, ch.3, Appendix | id=-}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[primary experience]]'' (Freud){{cn|date=September 2017}}{{synth|date=September 2017}}.

===Notation and strategies===
{{how-to|date=September 2017}}
In documenting mental strategies and processing by the senses, NLP practitioners{{who|date=September 2017}} often use a simple shorthand for different modalities, with a letter indicating the representation system concerned, and often, a [[superscript]] to indicate how that system is being used. Three key aspects are commonly notated: The ''representation system'' being used (visual/V, auditory/A, kinesthetic/K, and occasionally, O/G), whether the ''direction of attention'' is internal &lt;sup&gt;(i)&lt;/sup&gt; or external &lt;sup&gt;(e)&lt;/sup&gt;, and whether the event is a ''recollection'' of an actual past event &lt;sup&gt;(r)&lt;/sup&gt; or ''construction'' of an imaginary event &lt;sup&gt;(c)&lt;/sup&gt;. Due to its importance in human cognitive processing, auditory internal dialogue, or talking in one's head, has its own shorthand: A&lt;sup&gt;id&lt;/sup&gt;.

Putting these together, this is a very simplified example of some steps which might actually be involved in replying to a simple question such as "Do you like that dress?".  The table below is useful for teaching how to identify and access each representational system in context:

:{| class="wikitable" 
|-
! Step !! Activity ||Notation !! What it's being used for
|-
| 1 || auditory external || A&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; || Hear the question
|-
| 2 || visual internal || V&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; || picture to oneself the ''meaning'' of the question
|-
| 3 || visual external || V&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; || look at the dress
|-
| 4 || visual internal constructed || V&lt;sup&gt;ic&lt;/sup&gt; || create a mental image of the dress worn by the person
|-
| 5 || kinesthetic internal || K&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; || get an internal feeling from looking at it
|-
| 6 || [[Intrapersonal communication|auditory internal dialog]] || A&lt;sup&gt;id&lt;/sup&gt; || ask oneself 'Do I like that impression?'
|-
| 7 || auditory external || A&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; || reply
|-
|}

Logically, these or similar steps ''must'' take place somewhere in consciousness in order to cognitively make sense of the question and answer it.{{cn|date=September 2017}} A sequence of this kind is known{{by whom|date=September 2017}} in NLP as a ''[[strategy (NLP)|strategy]]'' - in this case, a functional outline of the strategy used by the mind in answering that question. In a similar way, the process leading to a panic attack of the form "I see the clock, ask myself where the kids are, imagine everything that could be happening and feel scared" might be notated as having a subjective structure: V&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; → A&lt;sup&gt;id&lt;/sup&gt; → V&lt;sup&gt;ic&lt;/sup&gt; → K&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;, signifying that an external sight leads to internal dialog (a question), followed by internal and constructed images, leading to a feeling.

Generally speaking, most human perceptual and cognitive processing occurs before conscious awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/|title=Psychology of Intelligence Analysis|last=Heuer, Jr.|first=Richards|publisher=Center for the Study of Intelligence|year=1999|isbn=1-929667-00-0|location=|pages=1|quote=A basic finding of cognitive psychology is that people have no conscious experience of most of what happens in the human mind. Many functions associated with perception, memory, and information processing are conducted prior to and independently of any conscious direction. What appears spontaneously in consciousness is the result of thinking, not the process of thinking.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{relevance inline}} For example, few people would ordinarily be aware that between question and even considering an answer, there must be steps in which the mind interprets and contextualizes the question itself, and steps which explore various possible strategies to be used to obtain an answer and select one to be followed.{{cn|date=September 2017}} The mental occurrence of these steps is often identified by deduction following skilled observation, or by careful inquiry, although their presence is usually self-apparent to the person concerned once noticed.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

===Sensory predicates and eye accessing cues===
Grinder and Bandler believed they identified pattern of relationship between the sensory-based language people use in general conversation, and for example, their eye movement (known as ''eye accessing cues'').&lt;ref name="frogs"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bandler, Richard  |author2=John Grinder  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Frogs into Princes: Neuro Linguistic Programming | location=Moab, UT | publisher=Real People Press | year=1979 | id=- | url= | pages=15, 24, 30, 45,52. | isbn=0-911226-18-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}

A common (but not universal) style of processing in the [[Western culture|West]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} is shown in the attached chart, where ''eye flickers'' in specific directions often seem to tie into specific kinds of internal (mental) processing.

NLP{{who|date=September 2017}} also suggests that sometimes (again not universally) such processing is associated with sensory word use; for example, a person asked what they liked about the beach, may flick their eyes briefly in some characteristic direction (visual memory access, often upwards) and then also use words that describe it in a visual sense ("The sea ''looked'' lovely", and so on). Likewise asked about a problem, someone may look in a different direction for a while (kinesthetic access, typically downwards) and then look puzzled and say "I just can't seem to ''get a grip'' on things". Taken together, NLP{{who|date=September 2017}} suggests such eye accessing cues (1) are idiosyncratic and habitual for each person, and (2) may form significant clues as to how a person is processing or representing a problem to themselves unconsciously.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

[[File:Mouvements-oculaires-PNL.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|The most common arrangement for eye accessing cues in a right-handed person.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;''Note: - NLP does ''not'' say it is 'always' this way, but rather that one should check whether reliable correlations seem to exist for an individual, and if so what they are'']] 
Common (but not universal) Western layout of eye accessing cues:
* Upwards (left/right) -- Visual (V) -- "I can ''imagine'' the big ''picture''"
* Level (left/right) -- Auditory (A) --  "Let's ''tone'' down the ''discussion''"
* Down-right—Kinesthetic (K) -- "to ''grasp'' a concept" or "to ''gather'' you've understood."
* Down-left [[Intrapersonal communication|Auditory internal dialogue]] (A&lt;sup&gt;id&lt;/sup&gt;) -- talking to oneself inside

Eye movement to the left or right for many people seems to indicate if a memory was recalled or constructed.{{cn|date=September 2017}} Thus remembering an actual image (V&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;) is associated more with up-left, whilst imagining one's dream home (V&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;) tends (again not universally) to be more associated with up-right.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

===Subjective awareness===
{{how-to|date=September 2017}}
When we think about the world, or about our past experiences, we represent those things inside our heads.{{cn|date=September 2017}} For example, think about the holiday you went on last year. Did you see a picture of where you went, tell yourself a story about what you did, feel the sun on your back and the wind in your hair? Can you bring to mind the smell of your favourite flower or the taste of a favourite meal??

The use of the various modalities can be identified based by learning to respond to subtle shifts in breathing, body posture, accessing cues, gestures, eye movement and language patterns such as sensory predicates.&lt;ref name="nlpvol1" &gt;{{cite book | author=Dilts, Robert B, Grinder, John, Bandler, Richard &amp; DeLozier, Judith A. | title=Neuro-Linguistic Programming: Volume I - The Study of the Structure of Subjective Experience | publisher=Meta Publications, 1980. . | year=1980 | url= | id=. | pages=3–4, 6, 14, 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}&lt;ref name="diltsdelozier2000"&gt;{{cite book | author=Dilts, Robert B, DeLozier, Judith A | title=Encyclopedia of Systemic Neuro-Linguistic Programming and NLP New Coding | publisher=NLP University Press | year=2000 | url=http://www.nlpuniversitypress.com/ | isbn=0-9701540-0-3 | pages=75, 383, 729, 938–943, 1003, 1300, 1303}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}

===Uses===
NLP's interest in the senses is not so much in their role as bridges to the outside world, but in their role as internal channels for cognitive processing and interpretation.{{cn|date=September 2017}} In an NLP perspective,{{weasel inline|date=September 2017}} it is not very important ''per se'' whether a person ''sees'' or ''hears'' some memory.{{cn|date=September 2017}} By contrast, NLP{{who|date=September 2017}} views it as potentially of great importance for the same person, to discover that some auditory sounds presented almost out of consciousness along with the memory, may be how the brain presents to consciousness, and how consciousness ''knows'', whether this is a heart-warming pleasant memory, or a fearsome phobic one.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Representational systems are also relevant since some tasks are better performed within one representational system than by another. For example, within education, spelling is better learned by children who have unconsciously used a strategy of visualization, than an unconscious strategy of phonetically "sounding out". When taught to visualize, previously poor spellers can indeed be taught to improve.&lt;ref name="Bandler 1979 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Bandler | first=Richard | title=Frogs into princes : neuro linguistic programming | publisher=Real People Press | location=Moab, Utah | year=1979 | isbn=978-0-911226-19-5 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}} NLP proponents also found that pacing and leading the various cues tended to build [[rapport (NLP)|rapport]], and allowed people to communicate more effectively. Certain studies suggest that using similar representational systems to another person can help build rapport&lt;ref name="James W.

==The preferred representational system (PRS)==

Originally NLP taught that people preferred one representational system over another. People could be stuck by thinking about a problem in their "preferred representational system" (PRS). Some took this idea further and categorised people as [[Hearing (sense)|auditory]], [[kinesthetic]], and [[Visual thinking|visual thinkers]] (see also: [[learning styles]]). It was claimed that swifter and more effective results could be achieved by matching this preferred system. Although there is some research that supports the notion that eye movement can indicate visual and auditory (but not kinesthetic) components of thought in that moment,&lt;ref name="Buckner 1987"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buckner | last2 = Meara| last3= Reese|last4= Reese | year = 1987 | title =  Eye movement as an indicator of sensory components in thought.| doi = 10.1037/0022-0167.34.3.283 | journal = Journal of Counselling Psychology | volume = 34 | issue = 3| pages = 283–287 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{synth|date=September 2017}} the existence of a preferred representational system ascertainable from external cues (an important part of original NLP theory) was discounted by research in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Sharpley 1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharpley | first1 = C.

Similarly, The [[United States National Research Council|National Research Committee]] found little support for the influence of PRS as presented in early descriptions of NLP, Frogs into Princes (1979) and Structure of Magic (1975). However, "at a meeting with [[Richard Bandler]] in Santa Cruz, California, on July 9, 1986, the [National Research Committee] influence subcommittee... was informed that PRS was no longer considered an important component of NLP. He said that NLP had been revised." (p.&amp;nbsp;140)&lt;ref name="druckman"/&gt; The NLP developers, Robert Dilts et al. (1980) &lt;ref name="nlpvol1" /&gt; proposed that eye movement (and sometimes bodily gesture) correspond to accessing cues for representations systems, and connected it to specific sides in the brain.

&lt;/ref&gt; The act of buying and selling [[organ transplant|organs]] may be against one's cultural mores; it may be repugnant.  Hence, this is an additional costs one must bear if such a market was deemed repugnant in the context of one's culture.

{{Globalize/US|date=April 2018}}
The '''right to privacy''' is an element of various legal traditions to restrain [[governmental]] and private actions that threaten the [[privacy]] of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.privacilla.org/business/privacytorts.html The Privacy Torts]" (December 19, 2000). Privacilla.org.{{failed verification|reason=Source addresses particular development in US law, lacking the universal perspective expressed in intro|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.uml.edu/sgallagher/Brandeisprivacy.htm|title=Right to Privacy|author=|date=|website=faculty.uml.edu|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 150 national constitutions mention the right to privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/search?lang=en&amp;key=privacy|title=Read about "Right to privacy" on Constitute|author=|date=|website=constituteproject.org|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures]] of 2013, initiated by ex-[[NSA]] employee [[Edward Snowden]], the inalienable human right to privacy has been a subject of international debate. In combating worldwide terrorism, government agencies, such as the [[NSA]], [[CIA]], [[R&amp;AW]] and [[GCHQ]], have engaged in [[mass surveillance|mass]], [[global surveillance]].

There is now a question as whether the right to privacy act can co-exist with the [[surveillance state|current capabilities]] of [[intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]] to access and analyse virtually in every detail of an individual's life. A major question is that whether or not the right to privacy needs to be forfeited as part of the [[social contract]] to bolster defense against supposed terrorist threats.

Private sector actors could also threaten the right to privacy. Increasingly, questions have arisen about the use of [[Personally identifiable information|personal data]] for targeted advertising, sharing data with external parties and reusing personal data within [[big data]] by large technology giants, such as  [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]],  [[Apple Inc.|Apple]],  [[Facebook]],  [[Google]], and [[Yahoo]]. These concerns have been strengthened by scandals, revealing that the [[Psychographics|psychographic]] company [[Cambridge Analytica]] was using personal data, illegitimately obtained through Facebook, to manipulate and influence large groups of people, including during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 US Presidential elections]].

==Background==
State of consideration of constitutional laws and acts formed by sectors and sections

Privacy uses the theory of [[natural rights]], and generally responds to new information and communication technologies. In the United States, an article in the December 15, 1890 issue of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', written by attorney [[Samuel D. Warren]] and future U.S. Supreme Court Justice, [[Louis Brandeis]], entitled "[[The Right to Privacy (article)|The Right to Privacy]]", is often cited as the first explicit declaration of a U.S. right to privacy. Warren and Brandeis wrote that privacy is the "right to be let alone", and focused on protecting individuals.  This approach was a response to recent technological developments of the time, such as photography, and sensationalist journalism, also known as "[[yellow journalism]]".&lt;ref name=Brandeis&gt;Warren and Brandeis, [http://www.law.louisville.edu/library/collections/brandeis/node/225 "The Right to Privacy"], 4 ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' 193 (1890)&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy rights are inherently intertwined with information technology. In his widely cited [[dissenting opinion]] in ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'' (1928), Brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in his 1890 article ''The Right to Privacy''. But in his dissent, he now changed the focus whereby he urged making personal privacy matters more relevant to [[constitutional law]], going so far as saying "the government [was] identified...as a potential privacy invader." He writes, "Discovery and invention have made it possible for the Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet." At that time, telephones were often community assets, with shared party lines and the potentially nosey human operators. By the time of [[Katz v. United States|Katz]], in 1967, telephones had become personal devices with lines not shared across homes and switching was electro-mechanical. In the 1970s, new computing and recording technologies began to raise concerns about privacy, resulting in the [[FTC Fair Information Practice|Fair Information Practice Principles]].

===Definitions===
In recent years there has been only few attempts to clearly and precisely define the "right to privacy". In 2005, students of the [[Haifa Center for Law &amp; Technology]] asserted that in fact the right to privacy "should not be defined as a separate legal right" at all. By their reasoning, existing laws relating to privacy in general should be sufficient.&lt;ref name=Haifa&gt;Yael Onn, et al., [https://books.google.com/books?id=yeVRrrJw-zAC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=right+to+privacy+tel+aviv&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T0IhTaWhEI-msQOizMWZCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=right%20to%20privacy%20tel%20aviv&amp;f=false ''Privacy in the Digital Environment''],  Haifa Center of Law &amp; Technology, (2005) pp. 1–12&lt;/ref&gt; Other experts, such as [[William Prosser (academic)|William Prosser]], have attempted, but failed, to find a "common ground" between the leading kinds of privacy cases in the court system, at least to formulate a definition.&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt; One law school treatise from Israel, however, on the subject of "privacy in the digital environment," suggests that the "right to privacy should be seen as an independent right that deserves legal protection in itself." It has therefore proposed a working definition for a "right to privacy":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The right to privacy is our right to keep a domain around us, which includes all those things that are part of us, such as our body, home, property, thoughts, feelings, secrets and identity. The right to privacy gives us the ability to choose which parts in this domain can be accessed by others, and to control the extent, manner and timing of the use of those parts we choose to disclose.&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===An individual right===
[[Alan Westin]] believes that new technologies alter the balance between privacy and disclosure, and that privacy rights may limit government surveillance to protect democratic processes. Westin defines privacy as "the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others". Westin describes four states of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, reserve.  These states must balance participation against norms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Each individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment process in which he balances the desire for privacy with the desire for disclosure and communication of himself to others, in light of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which he lives.
:— Alan Westin, ''Privacy and Freedom'', 1968&lt;ref&gt;Westin, A. (1968). ''Privacy and Freedom'' (Fifth ed.). New York.: Atheneum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under liberal democratic systems, privacy creates a space separate from political life, and allows personal autonomy, while ensuring democratic [[Freedom of association|freedoms of association]] and [[Freedom of speech|expression]].

David Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy.  He develops 'data protection' as an aspect of privacy, which involves "the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information".  This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally.  Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control, "[i]ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used".&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, D. (1989). Protecting privacy in surveillance societies: The federal republic of Germany, Sweden, France, Canada, and the United States. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marc Rotenberg]] has described the modern right to privacy as Fair Information Practices: "the rights and responsibilities associated with the collection and use of personal information." Rotenberg emphasizes that the allocation of rights are to the data subject and the responsibilities are assigned to the data collectors because of the transfer of the data and the asymmetry of information concerning data practices.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, A. &amp; Rotenberg, M. (2016). Privacy Law and Society. West Academic.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Posner]] and [[Lawrence Lessig]] focus on the economic aspects of personal information control.  Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information, which reduces market efficiency.  For Posner, employment is selling oneself in the labour market, which he believes is like selling a product. Any 'defect' in the 'product' that is not reported is fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, R. A. (1981). The economics of privacy. [[The American Economic Review]], 71(2), 405–409.&lt;/ref&gt; For Lessig, privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law.  Lessig claims "the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right", and that "individuals should be able to control information about themselves".&lt;ref&gt;Lessig, L. (2006). Code: Version 2.0. New York, U.S.: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  Economic approaches to privacy make communal conceptions of privacy difficult to maintain.

===A collective value and a human right===
There have been attempts to reframe privacy as a fundamental [[Human rights|human right]], whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Deborah|title=Ethical theory and business.|year=2009|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0136126022|pages=428–442|edition=8th|authorlink=Privacy|editors=Beauchamp, Bowie, Arnold}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Amitai Etzioni]] suggests a [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] approach to privacy.  This requires a shared moral culture for establishing social order.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2006). Communitarianism. In B. S. Turner (Ed.), The Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology (pp. 81–83). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Etzioni believes that "[p]rivacy is merely one good among many others",&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2007). "Are new technologies the enemy of privacy?" ''Knowledge, Technology &amp; Policy'', 20, 115–119.&lt;/ref&gt; and that technological effects depend on community accountability and oversight.  He claims that privacy laws only increase government surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2000). A communitarian perspective on privacy. Connecticut Law Review, 32(3), 897–905.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy.  She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions: shared perceptions, public values, and [[Collectivism|collective]] components.  Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought.  Public values guarantee democratic participation, including freedoms of speech and association, and limits government power.  Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided.  Regan's goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making: "if we did recognize the collective or public-good value of privacy, as well as the common and public value of privacy, those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection".&lt;ref&gt;Regan, P. M. (1995). Legislating privacy: Technology, social values, and public policy. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation, and ensures human dignity and autonomy.  Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed, and if this is appropriate. Violations of privacy depend on context.  The human right to privacy has precedent in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people-centered perspective, and not through the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Shade, L. R. (2008). Reconsidering the right to privacy in Canada. Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society, 28(1), 80–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Universal Declaration of Human Rights ===
A right to privacy is explicitly stated under Article 12 of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Privacy laws in different countries ==

=== United States ===
{{main article| Privacy laws of the United States}}
Although the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] does not explicitly include the right to privacy, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has found that the Constitution implicitly grants a right to privacy against governmental intrusion from the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], [[Third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Third Amendment]], [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], and the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Hao. ''Protecting Privacy in China: A Research on China's Privacy Standards and the Possibility of Establishing the Right to Privacy and the Information Privacy Protection Legislation in Modern China''. Heidelberg: Springer, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This right to privacy has been the justification for decisions involving a wide range of [[civil liberties]] cases, including ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'', which invalidated a successful 1922 [[Oregon]] [[initiative]] requiring compulsory [[state school|public education]], ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', where a right to privacy was first established explicitly, ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which struck down a [[Texas]] abortion law and thus restricted state powers to enforce laws against [[abortion]], and ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', which struck down a Texas [[sodomy law]] and thus eliminated state powers to enforce laws against [[sodomy]].

The 1890 Warren and Brandeis article "The Right To Privacy" is often cited as the first implicit declaration of a U.S. right to privacy.&lt;ref name=Brandeis/&gt;  This right is frequently debated. [[Strict constructionism|Strict constructionists]]{{who|date=August 2013}} argue that  such right exists (or at least that the Supreme Court has more jurisdiction to protect such a right), while some civil libertarians{{who|date=August 2013}} argue that the right invalidates many types of currently allowed acts not to be [[surveillance]] ([[telephone tapping|wiretaps]], public cameras [[film industry]], etc.).

Most states of the United States {{who|date=January 2014}}also grant a right to privacy and recognize four [[tort]]s based on that right:
#Intrusion upon seclusion or solitude, or into private affairs;
#[[Public disclosure]] of embarrassing private facts;
#[[Publicity]] which places a person in a false light in the public eye; and
#[[Personality rights|Appropriation]] of name or likeness.

The four privacy torts above were introduced by [[William Lloyd Prosser|William Prosser]] in his ''California Law Review'' article titled "Privacy" in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M.|first=Richards, Neil|last2=J.|first2=Solove, Daniel|date=2010|title=Prosser's Privacy Law: A Mixed Legacy|url=https://doi.org/10.15779/Z38541P|journal=California Law Review|language=en|volume=98|issue=6|doi=10.15779/z38541p}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that these torts, along with the "Right to Privacy"  article by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis form the basis for modern U.S. privacy legislation.

Right to privacy and social media content laws have been considered and enacted in several states, such as California’s “online erasure” law protecting minors from leaving a digital trail. However, the United States is still far behind that of European Union countries in protecting privacy online. For example, the “right to be forgotten” ruling by the EU Court of Justice protects both adults and minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zurbriggen|first1=Eileen L.|last2=Hagai|first2=Ella Ben|last3=Leon|first3=Gabrielle|title=Negotiating privacy and intimacy on social media: Review and recommendations.|journal=Translational Issues in Psychological Science|volume=2|issue=3|pages=248–260|doi=10.1037/tps0000078|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/tps0000078|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice [[Jagdish Singh Khehar|JS Khehar]], ruled on August 24, 2017 that the Right to Privacy is a fundamental right for Indian citizens under the Constitution of India (mostly under Article 21 and additionally under Part III rights). Thus no legislation passed by the government can unduly violate it. Specifically, the court adopted the three-pronged test required for encroachment of any Article 21 right – legality-i.e. through an existing law; necessity, in terms of a legitimate state objective and proportionality, that ensures a rational nexus between the object of the invasion and the means adopted to achieve that object. This clarification was crucial to prevent the dilution of the right in the future on the whims and fancies of the government in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thewire.in/170988/right-to-privacy-supreme-court-2/|title=For the Many and the Few: What a Fundamental Right to Privacy Means for India - The Wire|author=|date=|website=The Wire|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling by the Supreme Court paved the way for decriminalisation of homosexuality in India on 6 September 2018, thus legalising same-sex sexual intercourse between two consenting adults in private.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thequint.com/india/2017/08/24/supreme-court-verdict-right-to-privacy|title=Too Lazy to Read Right to Privacy Ruling?

The new data sharing policy of Whatsapp with Facebook after Facebook acquired Whatsapp in 2014 has been challenged in the Supreme Court.

== Journalism ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
It is often claimed, particularly by those in the eye of the [[mass media|media]], that their right to privacy is violated when information about their private lives is reported in the press.  The point of view of the press, however, is that the general public have a right to know personal information about those with status as a [[public figure]].  This distinction is encoded in most legal traditions as an element of [[freedom of speech]].

==Mass surveillance and privacy==
{{further information|Global surveillance|Edward Snowden|Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)}}

Governmental organizations such as the NSA, CIA, and GCHQ amongst others conduct [[mass surveillance]] throughout [[Global surveillance|the world]]. Programs such as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], [[MYSTIC (surveillance program)|MYSTIC]], and other operations conducted by [[NATO]]-member states are capable of collecting a vast quantity of metadata, internet history, and even actual recordings of phone calls from various countries. The existence of programs is justified by their conductors in terms of supposed benefits for defense and law enforcement, however this is also in conflict with the right to privacy established under various treaties, constitutions, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The argument in favor of privacy has therefore come under a larger opposition to [[intelligence agency|intelligence operations]] carried out for political purposes, and has become a contentious issue since it undermines the perceived need of nations to spy on the general population in order to maintain their power structures.

==Support==
* The right to privacy is alluded to in the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution, which states, "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,{{efn|Effects are items of property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Denniston|first1=Lyle|title=Argument preview: Police and cellphone privacy|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/04/argument-preview-police-and-cellphone-privacy/|publisher=SCOTUSblog|accessdate=July 1, 2014|date=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html|title=America's Founding Documents|author=|date=30 October 2015|website=archives.gov|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logical extension of the amendment to digital properties would make sense since if the internet had existed when it was written, digital documents would have been considered more important than the literal "papers" mentioned in the text.
* Privacy helps to avoid unwanted and potentially intrusive interference in an individual's personal affairs.
* Privacy is one of the rights that were absent in the society in [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. Without privacy, there would be nothing to stop a [[Big Brother (1984 character)|Big Brother]]-like entity from taking control of every aspect of life.

==Opposition==
* In 1999, during a launch event for the [[Jini]] technology, [[Scott McNealy]], the chief executive officer of [[Sun Microsystems]], said that privacy issues were "a [[red herring]]" and then stated "You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it."&lt;ref&gt;Sprenger, Polly. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20170206072011/https://archive.wired.com/politics/law/news/1999/01/17538 Sun on Privacy: 'Get Over It']". ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''. January 26, 1999. Retrieved on Feb 6, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[nothing to hide argument]] states that government [[data mining]] and surveillance programs do not threaten privacy unless they uncover some illegal activities and those committing such activities do not have the right to keep them private. One who supports this argument may state, "I've got nothing to hide" thus, not opposing data mining and surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;Mordini, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rncAXAFD1jcC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=privacy+%22nothing+to+hide%22+argument#v=onepage&amp;q=privacy%20%22nothing%20to%20hide%22%20argument&amp;f=false 252].&lt;/ref&gt;
* In wake of the Snowden scandal, governments have claimed that there is an existential terrorist threat that overrides the so-called right to privacy.

RosettaNet has several local user groups. The European User Group is called EDIFICE.

==The RosettaNet standard==
The RosettaNet standard is based on [[XML]] and defines message guidelines, interfaces for business processes, and implementation frameworks for interactions between companies.  Mostly addressed is the [[supply chain]] area, but also manufacturing, product and material data and service processes are in scope.

The standard is widely spread in the global semiconductor industry, but also in electronic components, consumer electronics, telecommunication and logistics. RosettaNet originated in the USA and is widely used there, but it is also well accepted and even supported by governments in Asia. Due to the widespread use of [[EDIFACT]] in Europe, RosettaNet is used less, but it is growing.{{Citation needed|reason=need reliable source to indicate use is growing|date=May 2014}}

The RosettaNet Automated Enablement standard (RAE) uses the [[Office Open XML]] document standard.&lt;ref&gt;''an international open document standard called ECMA Open XML'' {{Cite web|author=Lin, Woon Wu|date=June 2007|title=RosettaNet Malaysia introduces new biz standard for local SMIs|url=http://www.rosettanet.org.my/news_231007(1).aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025020251/http://www.rosettanet.org.my/news_231007%281%29.aspx|archivedate=25 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6970">{{Utilitarianism}}
'''Rule utilitarianism''' is a form of [[utilitarianism]] that says an action is right as it conforms to a rule that leads to the greatest good, or that "the rightness or wrongness of a particular action is a function of the correctness of the rule of which it is an instance".&lt;ref name="Garner and Rosen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Garner |first=Richard T. |author2=Bernard Rosen  |title=Moral Philosophy: A Systematic Introduction to Normative Ethics and Meta-ethics |year=1967 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] |location=New York |isbn=0-02-340580-5 |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers [[Richard Brandt]] and [[Brad Hooker]] are major proponents of such approach.

For rule utilitarians, the correctness of a rule is determined by the amount of good it brings about when followed. In contrast, [[Act utilitarianism|act utilitarians]] judge an act in terms of the consequences of that act alone (such as stopping at a red light), rather than judging whether it faithfully adhered to the rule of which it was an instance (such as, "always stop at red lights"). Rule utilitarians argue that following rules that tend to lead to the greatest good will have better consequences overall than allowing exceptions to be made in individual instances, even if better consequences can be demonstrated in those instances.

==Mill's formulation==
In his 1863 book ''[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]]'', [[John Stuart Mill]] defends the concept of [[rights]] in terms of utility: "To have a right, then, is, I conceive, to have something which society ought to defend me in the possession of. If the objector goes on to ask, why it ought? I can give him no other reason than general utility."&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |authorlink=John Stuart Mill |title=[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]] |year=1861 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Mill was a rule utilitarian is a matter of controversy.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism-rule/ |title=Rule Consequentialism |accessdate=2007-03-11 |date=2003-12-31 |publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This passage from '' Utilitarianism'' seems to suggest that he was:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the case of abstinences indeed—of things which people forbear to do from moral considerations, though the consequences in the particular case might be beneficial—it would be unworthy of an intelligent agent not to be consciously aware that the action is of a class which, if practiced generally, would be generally injurious, and that this is the ground of the obligation to abstain from it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
But Mill also argues that it is sometimes right to violate general ethical rules:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... justice is a name for certain moral requirements, which, regarded collectively, stand higher in the scale of social utility, and are therefore of more paramount obligation, than any others; though particular cases may occur in which some other social duty is so important, as to overrule any one of the general maxims of justice. Thus, to save a life, it may not only be allowable, but a duty, to steal, or take by force, the necessary food or medicine, or to kidnap, and compel to officiate, the only qualified medical practitioner.&lt;ref name="Mill" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other  things being equal people are happier if their society follows rules so people know what types of behaviour they can expect from others in given situations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}  Therefore, utilitarians can justify a system that goes, "Keep to the rules unless there is a strong reason for breaking them."

==Strong rule utilitarianism==

'''Strong rule utilitarianism''' ('''SRU''') gives a utilitarian account for the claim that moral rules should be obeyed at all places and times. SRU does not deteriorate into [[act utilitarianism]] like weak rule utilitarianism, but it shares weaknesses with similarly [[Moral absolutism|absolutist moral stances]] (notably, [[deontology|deontological]] ones). A scenario (or [[thought experiment]]) used to clarify this problem (often attributed to [[Kantian ethics#Lying|Immanuel Kant]]) posits both

# you know the location of some persons
# a murderer asks you about their location in order to go and kill them.

The moral convention is that lying is wrong, so the strong rule utilitarian says you should reveal their location. A more sophisticated SRU response is that

# the above scenario is very improbable.
# in the majority of situations, telling the truth leads to more trust and happiness.
# if applied universally (à la [[Kant]]'s [[categorical imperative]]), the rule against lying would create net utility.

Nevertheless, many disagree, claiming that (in this situation) telling the truth would result in needless death, would therefore be immoral, and that this scenario thus provides a [[counterexample]] contradicting SRU.

==Weak rule utilitarianism==

'''Weak rule utilitarianism''' ('''WRU''') attempts to handle [[#Strong rule utilitarianism|SRU]] counterexamples as legitimate exceptions. One such response is [[two-level utilitarianism]]; more systematic WRUs attempt to create sub-rules to handle the exceptions. But as [[David Lyons (philosopher)|David Lyons]]&lt;ref&gt;''Forms and Limits of Utilitarianism'', 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; and others have argued, this will necessarily tend to collapse into [[act utilitarianism]]. Rules will require as many sub-rules as there are exceptions, thus many exceptions will make the more-sophisticated rule computationally intractable. [[Rational agents]] will then [[satisfice]] that intractability by seeking outcomes that produce the maximum utility.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Habib (2008), "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/promises/ Promises]", in the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes.jpg|thumb|200px|The original cover of [[Thomas Hobbes]]'s work ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651), in which he discusses the concept of the social contract theory]]

In both [[Moral philosophy|moral]] and [[political philosophy]], the '''social contract''' is a theory or model that originated during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and usually concerns the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the authority of the [[State (polity)|state]] over the [[individual]].&lt;ref&gt;"For the name social contract (or original contract) often covers two different kinds of contract, and, in tracing the evolution of the theory, it is well to distinguish them. Both were current in the 17th century and both can be discovered in Greek political thought. ... [The first] generally involved some theory of the origin of the state. The second form of social contract may be more accurately called the contract of government, or the contract of submission....  Generally, it has nothing to do with the origins of society, but, presupposing a society already formed, it purports to define the terms on which that society is to be governed: the people have made a contract with their ruler which determines their relations with him. They promise him obedience, while he promises his protection and good government. While he keeps his part of the bargain, they must keep theirs, but if he misgoverns the contract is broken and allegiance is at an end." [[J. W. Gough]], ''The Social Contract'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1936), pp.{{nbsp}}2–3. Modern revivals of social contract theories have not been as concerned with the origin of the state.&lt;/ref&gt; Social contract arguments typically posit that individuals have consented, either explicitly or [[tacit consent|tacitly]], to surrender some of their freedoms and submit to the authority of the ruler (or to the decision of a majority) in exchange for protection of their remaining [[rights]].

Therefore, the relation between [[natural and legal rights]] is often a topic of social contract theory. The term takes its name from ''[[The Social Contract]]'' (French: ''Du contrat social ou Principes du droit politique''), a 1762 book by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] that discussed this concept.

Although the antecedents of social contract theory are found in antiquity, in [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy and [[Roman law|Roman]] and [[Canon Law]], the heyday of the social contract was the mid-17th to early 19th centuries, when it emerged as the leading doctrine of political legitimacy. The starting point for most social contract theories is an examination of the human condition absent of any political order that [[Thomas Hobbes]] termed the "[[state of nature]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ross Harrison writes that "Hobbes seems to have invented this useful term." See Ross Harrison, ''Locke, Hobbs, and Confusion's Masterpiece'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p.{{nbsp}}70. The phrase "state of nature" does occur, in  [[State of nature#History|Thomas Aquinas]]'s [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/QDdeVer19.htm ''Quaestiones disputatae de veritate'', Question 19, Article 1, Answer 13]. However, Aquinas uses it in the context of a discussion of the nature of the soul after death, not in reference to politics.&lt;/ref&gt; In this condition, individuals' actions are bound only by their personal [[power (philosophy)|power]] and [[conscience]]. From this shared starting point, social contract theorists seek to demonstrate, in different ways, why a rational individual would voluntarily consent to give up their natural freedom to obtain the benefits of political order.

Prominent of 17th- and 18th-century theorists of social contract and natural rights include [[Hugo Grotius]] (1625), [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1651), [[Samuel von Pufendorf]] (1673), [[John Locke]] (1689), [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1762), and [[Immanuel Kant]] (1797). Each solved the problem of political authority differently. Grotius posited that individual humans had [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]]. [[Thomas Hobbes]] famously said that in a "[[state of nature]]", human life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short". In the absence of political order and law, everyone would have unlimited natural freedoms, including the "right to all things" and thus the freedom to plunder, rape, and murder; there would be an endless "war of all against all" (''[[bellum omnium contra omnes]]''). To avoid this, free men contract with each other to establish political [[community]] ([[civil society]]) through a social contract in which they all gain security in return for subjecting themselves to an absolute sovereign, one man or an assembly of men. Though the sovereign's edicts may well be arbitrary and tyrannical, Hobbes saw absolute government as the only alternative to the terrifying anarchy of a state of nature. Hobbes asserted that humans consent to abdicate their rights in favor of the absolute authority of government (whether monarchical or parliamentary). Pufendorf disputed Hobbes's equation of a state of nature with war.&lt;ref name="Patrick Riley 2006 pp. 347"&gt;Patrick Riley, ''The Social Contract and Its Critics'', chapter{{nbsp}}12 in ''The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Political Thought'', Eds. Mark Goldie and Robert Wokler, Vol{{nbsp}}4 of ''The Cambridge History of Political Thought'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), pp.{{nbsp}}347–75.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] argued that we gain civil rights in return for accepting the obligation to respect and defend the rights of others, giving up some freedoms to do so.

The central assertion that social contract approaches is that law and political order are not natural, but human creations. The social contract and the political order it creates are simply the means towards an end—the benefit of the individuals involved—and legitimate only to the extent that they fulfill their part of the agreement. Hobbes argued that government is not a party to the original contract and citizens are not obligated to submit to the government when it is too weak to act effectively to suppress factionalism and civil unrest. According to other social contract theorists, when the government fails to secure their natural rights (Locke) or satisfy the best interests of society (called the "[[general will]]" in Rousseau), citizens can withdraw their obligation to obey, or change the leadership through elections or other means including, when necessary, violence.

Locke believed that [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]] were inalienable, and therefore the rule of God superseded government authority, while Rousseau believed that democracy (self-rule) was the best way to ensure welfare while maintaining individual freedom under the rule of law. The Lockean concept of the social contract was invoked in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. Social contract theories were eclipsed in the 19th{{nbsp}}century in favor of [[utilitarianism]], [[Hegelianism]], and [[Marxism]], and were revived in the 20th{{nbsp}}century, notably in the form of a [[Original position|thought experiment]] by [[John Rawls]].&lt;ref name="Patrick Riley 2006 pp. 347"/&gt;

==History==
The concept of the social contract was originally posed by [[Glaucon]], as described by [[Plato]] in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Book{{nbsp}}II.

{{quote|They say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice, evil; but that the evil is greater than the good. And so when men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both, not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they had better agree among themselves to have neither; hence there arise laws and mutual covenants; and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just. This they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice;—it is a mean or compromise, between the best of all, which is to do injustice and not be punished, and the worst of all, which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation; and justice, being at a middle point between the two, is tolerated not as a good, but as the lesser evil, and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice. For no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist; he would be mad if he did. Such is the received account, Socrates, of the nature and origin of justice.&lt;ref&gt;The Republic, Book II. Quoted from http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.3.ii.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The social contract theory also appears in ''[[Crito]]'', another dialogue from Plato.  Over time, the social contract theory became more widespread after [[Epicurus]] (341-270 BC), the first philosopher who saw justice as a social contract, and not as existing in Nature due to divine intervention (see below and also [[Epicureanism#Ethics|Epicurean ethics]]), decided to bring the theory to the forefront of his society.  As time went on, philosophers of traditional political and social thought, such as Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau put forward their opinions on social contract, which then caused the topic to become much more mainstream.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Social contract formulations are preserved in many of the world's oldest records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timetoast.com/timelines/enlightenment--33?print=1|title=https://www.timetoast.com/timelines/enlightenment--33?print=1|website=www.timetoast.com|access-date=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist text of the second century BCE, [[Mahāvastu]], recounts the legend of Mahasammata. The story goes as follows:
{{quote|In the early days of the cosmic cycle mankind lived on an immaterial plane, dancing on air in a sort of fairyland, where there was no need of food or clothing, and no private property, family, government or laws. Then gradually the process of cosmic decay began its work, and mankind became earthbound, and felt the need of food and shelter. As men lost their primeval glory, distinctions of class arose, and they entered into agreements with one another, accepting the institution of private property and the family. With this theft, murder, adultery, and other crime began, and so the people met together and decided to appoint one man from among them to maintain order in return for a share of the produce of their fields and herds. He was called "the Great Chosen One" (Mahasammata), and he received the title of raja because he pleased the people.&lt;ref name="AL Basham pp 83"&gt;AL Basham, ''The Wonder That Was India'', pp. 83&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his rock edicts, the Buddhist king [[Asoka]] was said to have argued for a broad and far-reaching social contract. The Buddhist ''vinaya'' also reflects social contracts expected of the monks; one such instance is when the people of a certain town complained about monks felling saka trees, the Buddha tells his monks that they must stop and give way to social norms.

[[Epicurus]] in the fourth century BCE seemed to have had a strong sense of social contract, with justice and law being rooted in mutual agreement and advantage, as evidenced by these lines, among others, from his ''Principal Doctrines'' (see also [[Epicureanism#Ethics|Epicurean ethics]]):

{{quote|31. Natural justice is a pledge of reciprocal benefit, to prevent one man from harming or being harmed by another.

32. Those animals which are incapable of making binding agreements with one another not to inflict nor suffer harm are without either justice or injustice; and likewise for those peoples who either could not or would not form binding agreements not to inflict nor suffer harm.

33. There never was such a thing as absolute justice, but only agreements made in mutual dealings among men in whatever places at various times providing against the infliction or suffering of harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vincent Cook |url=http://www.epicurus.net/en/principal.html |title=Principal Doctrines |publisher=Epicurus |date=2000-08-26 |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Renaissance developments===
[[Quentin Skinner]] has argued that several critical modern innovations in contract theory are found in the writings from French Calvinists and Huguenots, whose work in turn was invoked by writers in the [[Low Countries]] who objected to their subjection to Spain and, later still, by Catholics in England.&lt;ref&gt;Quentin Skinner, ''The Foundations of Modern Political Thought: Volume 2: The Age of the Reformation'' (Cambridge, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francisco Suárez]] (1548–1617), from the [[School of Salamanca]], might be considered an early theorist of the social contract, theorizing [[natural law]] in an attempt to limit the [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right]] of [[absolute monarchy]]. All of these groups were led to articulate notions of popular [[sovereignty]] by means of a social covenant or contract, and all of these arguments began with proto-"state of nature" arguments, to the effect that the basis of politics is that everyone is by nature free of subjection to any government.

These arguments, however, relied on a corporatist theory found in Roman law, according to which "a populus" can exist as a distinct legal entity. Thus, these arguments held that a group of people can join a government because it has the capacity to exercise a single will and make decisions with a single voice in the absence of sovereign authority—a notion rejected by Hobbes and later contract theorists.

==Philosophers==

===Hugo Grotius (1625)===
In the early 17th century, [[Grotius]] (1583–1645) introduced the modern idea that individuals had ''natural rights'' that enabled self-preservation, employing this idea as a basis for moral consensus in the face of religious diversity and the rise of natural science. He seeks to find a parsimonious basis for a moral beginning for society, a kind of [[natural law]] that everyone could accept. He goes so far as to say in his ''[[De jure belli ac pacis|On the Law of War and Peace]]'' that even if we were to concede what we cannot concede without the utmost wickedness, namely that there is no God, these laws would still hold.

The idea was considered incendiary since it suggested that power can ultimately go back to the individuals if the political society that they have set up forfeits the purpose for which it was originally established, which is to preserve themselves. In other words, individual persons are sovereign. Grotius says that the people are ''sui juris'' (under their own jurisdiction). People have rights as human beings, but there is a delineation of those rights because of what is possible for everyone to accept morally; everyone has to accept that each person as an individual is entitled to try to preserve himself. Each person should, therefore, avoid doing harm to, or interfering with, another, and any breach of these rights should be punished.

===Thomas Hobbes' ''Leviathan'' (1651)===
{{main|Leviathan (Hobbes book)}}

The first modern philosopher to articulate a detailed contract theory was [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679). According to Hobbes, the lives of individuals in the [[state of nature]] were "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short", a state in which self-interest and the absence of rights and contracts prevented the "social", or society. Life was "anarchic" (without leadership or the concept of sovereignty). Individuals in the state of nature were apolitical and asocial. This state of nature is followed by the social contract.

The social contract was an "occurrence" during which individuals came together and ceded some of their [[natural rights|individual rights]] so that others would cede theirs.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. person{{nbsp}}A gives up his/her right to kill person{{nbsp}}B if person{{nbsp}}B does the same.&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the establishment of the state, a sovereign entity like the individuals now under its rule used to be, which would create laws to regulate social interactions. Human life was thus no longer "a war of all against all".

The state system, which grew out of the social contract, was, however, also anarchic (without leadership). Just as the individuals in the state of nature had been sovereigns and thus guided by self-interest and the absence of rights, so states now acted in their self-interest in competition with each other. Just like the state of nature, states were thus bound to be in conflict because there was no sovereign over and above the state (more powerful) capable of imposing some system such as social-contract laws on everyone by force. Indeed, Hobbes' work helped to serve as a basis for the [[Political realism|realism]] theories of international relations, advanced by [[E. H. Carr]] and [[Hans Morgenthau]]. Hobbes wrote in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' that humans ("we") need the "terrour of some Power" otherwise humans will not heed the [[Golden Rule|law of reciprocity]], "(in summe) doing to others, as wee would be done to".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobbes|first1=Thomas|title=Leviathan|date=1985|publisher=Penguin|location=London|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Locke's ''Second Treatise of Government'' (1689)===
[[John Locke]]'s conception of the social contract differed from Hobbes' in several fundamental ways, retaining only the central notion that persons in a state of nature would willingly come together to form a state. Locke believed that individuals in a state of nature would be bound morally, by the Law of Nature, not to harm each other in their lives or possessions. Without government to defend them against those seeking to injure or enslave them, Locke further believed people would have no security in their rights and would live in fear. Individuals, to Locke, would only agree to form a state that would provide, in part, a "neutral judge", acting to protect the lives, liberty, and property of those who lived within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaba|first=Jeffery|date=Spring 2007|title=John Locke and the Meaning of the Takings Clause|url=https://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3727&amp;context=mlr|journal=Missouri Law Review|volume=72|issue=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Hobbes argued for near-absolute authority, Locke argued for inviolate freedom under law in his [[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|''Second Treatise of Government'']]. Locke argued that a government's legitimacy comes from the citizens' delegation to the government of their absolute right of violence (reserving the inalienable right of self-defense or "self-preservation"), along with elements of other rights (e.g. property will be liable to taxation) as necessary to achieve the goal of security through granting the state a monopoly of violence, whereby the government, as an impartial judge, may use the collective force of the populace to administer and enforce the law, rather than each man acting as his own judge, jury, and executioner—the condition in the state of nature.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Jean-Jacques Rousseau's ''Du contrat social'' (1762)===
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778), in his influential 1762 treatise ''[[The Social Contract]]'', outlined a different version of social contract theory, as the foundations of [[political rights]] based on unlimited [[popular sovereignty]]. Although Rousseau wrote that the British were perhaps at the time the freest people on earth, he did not approve of their [[representative government]]. Rousseau believed that liberty was possible only where there was direct rule by the people as a whole in lawmaking, where popular sovereignty was indivisible and [[inalienable right|inalienable]]. But he also maintained that the people often did not know their "real will", and that a proper society would not occur until a great leader ("the Legislator") arose to change the values and customs of the people, likely through the strategic use of religion.

Rousseau's political theory differs in important ways from that of Locke and Hobbes. Rousseau's collectivism is most evident in his development of the "luminous conception" (which he credited to [[Denis Diderot]]) of the [[general will]]. Rousseau argues a citizen cannot pursue his true interest by being an [[Ethical egoism|egoist]] but must instead subordinate himself to the law created by the citizenry acting as a collective.

{{quote|[The social contract] can be reduced to the following terms: ''Each of us puts his person and all his power in common under the supreme direction of the general will; and in a body we receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole.''&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ''Oeuvres complètes'', ed.&amp;nbsp;B.&amp;nbsp;Gagnebin and M.&amp;nbsp;Raymond (Paris, 1959–95), III, 361; ''The Collected Writings of Rousseau'', ed.&amp;nbsp;C.&amp;nbsp;Kelley and R.&amp;nbsp;Masters (Hanover, 1990–), IV, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rousseau's striking phrase that man must "be forced to be free"&lt;ref&gt;''Oeuvres complètes'', III, 364; ''The Collected Writings of Rousseau'', IV, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; should be understood this way: since the indivisible and inalienable popular sovereignty decides what is good for the whole, then if an individual lapses back into his ordinary egoism and disobeys the law, he will be forced to listen to what was decided when the people acted as a collectivity (as [[citizen]]s). Thus, the law, inasmuch as it is created by the people acting as a body, is not a limitation of individual freedom, but rather its expression.

Thus, enforcement of laws, including [[criminal law]], is not a restriction on individual liberty: the individual, as a citizen, explicitly agreed to be constrained if, as a private individual, he did not respect his own will as formulated in the general will. Because laws represent the restraints of civil freedom, they represent the leap made from humans in the state of nature into civil society. In this sense, the law is a civilizing force, and therefore Rousseau believed that the laws that govern a people helped to mold their character.

===Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's individualist social contract (1851)===
While Rousseau's social contract is based on [[popular sovereignty]] and not on individual sovereignty, there are other theories espoused by [[individualist]]s, [[libertarians]], and [[Anarchism|anarchists]] that do not involve agreeing to anything more than [[Negative and positive rights|negative rights]] and creates only a limited state, if any.

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865) advocated a conception of social contract that did not involve an individual surrendering sovereignty to others. According to him, the social contract was not between individuals and the state, but rather among individuals who refrain from coercing or governing each other, each one maintaining complete sovereignty upon him- or herself:

{{quote|What really is the Social Contract? An agreement of the citizen with the government? No, that would mean but the continuation of [Rousseau's] idea. The social contract is an agreement of man with man; an agreement from which must result what we call society. In this, the notion of commutative justice, first brought forward by the primitive fact of exchange, ... is substituted for that of distributive justice ... Translating these words, contract, commutative justice, which are the language of the law, into the language of business, and you have commerce, that is to say, in its highest significance, the act by which man and man declare themselves essentially producers, and abdicate all pretension to govern each other.|Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|''[[The General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century|General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century]]'' (1851)}}

===John Rawls' ''Theory of Justice'' (1971)===
Building on the work of Immanuel Kant with its presumption of limits on the state,&lt;ref&gt;• Gerald Gaus and Shane D. Courtland, 2011, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/  "Liberalism"], 1.1, ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Immanuel Kant, ([1797]). ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', Part{{nbsp}}1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rawls]] (1921–2002), in ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971), proposed a contractarian approach whereby rational people in a hypothetical "[[original position]]" would set aside their individual preferences and capacities under a "[[veil of ignorance]]" and agree to certain general principles of justice and legal organization. This idea is also used as a [[game theory|game-theoretical]] formalization of the notion of fairness.

===David Gauthier's ''Morals By Agreement'' (1986)===
{{Main|Contractarian ethics}}
[[David Gauthier]] "neo-Hobbesian" theory argues that cooperation between two independent and self-interested parties is indeed possible, especially when it comes to understanding morality and politics.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/soc-cont/#SH3b |title=Social Contract Theory [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;#93; |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |date=2004-10-15 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauthier notably points out the advantages of cooperation between two parties when it comes to the challenge of the [[prisoner's dilemma]]. He proposes that, if two parties were to stick to the original agreed-upon arrangement and morals outlined by the contract, they would both experience an optimal result.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractarianism/#3 |title=Contractarianism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his model for the social contract, factors including trust, rationality, and self-interest keep each party honest and dissuade them from breaking the rules.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;

===Philip Pettit's ''Republicanism'' (1997)===
[[Philip Pettit]] (b. 1945) has argued, in ''Republicanism: A Theory of Freedom and Government'' (1997), that the theory of social contract, classically based on the [[consent of the governed]], should be modified. Instead of arguing for explicit consent, which can always be [[Manufacturing Consent|manufactured]], Pettit argues that the absence of an effective rebellion against it is a contract's only legitimacy.

==Critical theories==

===Consent of the governed===
An early critic of social contract theory was [[Rousseau]]'s friend, the philosopher [[David Hume]], who in 1742 published an essay "Of Civil Liberty". The second part of this essay, entitled "Of the Original Contract",&lt;ref name="Hume"&gt;{{cite book|url= |author=Hume, David|title= Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary, Part II, Essay XII, Of The Original Contract|publisher= |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; stresses that the concept of a "social contract" is a convenient fiction: {{quote|As no party, in the present age can well support itself without a philosophical or speculative system of principles annexed to its political or practical one; we accordingly find that each of the factions into which this nation is divided has reared up a fabric of the former kind, in order to protect and cover that scheme of actions which it pursues. ... The one party [defenders of the absolute and divine right of kings, or Tories], by tracing up government to the DEITY, endeavor to render it so sacred and inviolate that it must be little less than sacrilege, however tyrannical it may become, to touch or invade it in the smallest article. The other party [the Whigs, or believers in constitutional monarchy], by founding government altogether on the consent of the PEOPLE suppose that there is a kind of original contract by which the subjects have tacitly reserved the power of resisting their sovereign, whenever they find themselves aggrieved by that authority with which they have for certain purposes voluntarily entrusted him. |David Hume, "On Civil Liberty" [II.XII.1]&lt;ref name="Hume"/&gt;}}

Hume argued that [[consent of the governed]] was the ideal foundation on which a government should rest, but that it had not actually occurred this way in general. {{quote|My intention here is not to exclude the consent of the people from being one just foundation of government where it has place. It is surely the best and most sacred of any. I only contend that it has very seldom had place in any degree and never almost in its full extent. And that therefore some other foundation of government must also be admitted. |Ibid II.XII.20}}

===Natural law and constitutionalism===
Legal scholar [[Randy Barnett]] has argued&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.randybarnett.com/ Restoring the Lost Constitution: The Presumption of Liberty]'', Randy Barnett (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; that, while presence in the territory of a society may be necessary for consent, this does not constitute consent to ''all'' rules the society might make regardless of their content. A second condition of consent is that the rules be consistent with underlying principles of justice and the protection of natural and social rights, and have procedures for effective protection of those rights (or liberties). This has also been discussed by O.{{nbsp}}A. Brownson,&lt;ref name="brownson"/&gt; who argued that, in a sense, three "constitutions" are involved: first, the ''constitution of nature'' that includes all of what the Founders called "[[natural law]]"; second, the ''constitution of society'', an unwritten and commonly understood set of rules for the society formed by a social contract before it establishes a government, by which it does establish the third, a ''constitution of government''. To consent, a necessary condition is that the rules be ''[[constitution]]al'' in that sense.

===Tacit consent===
The theory of an implicit social contract holds that by remaining in the territory controlled by some society, which usually has a government, people give consent to join that society and be governed by its government, if any. This consent is what gives legitimacy to such a government.

Other writers have argued that consent to join the society is not necessarily consent to its government. For that, the government must be set up according to a constitution of government that is consistent with the superior unwritten constitutions of nature and society.&lt;ref name="brownson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://constitution.org/oab/am_rep.htm |author=O. A. Brownson |title=''The American Republic: its Constitution, Tendencies, and Destiny'' |year=1866 |accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Explicit Consent ===
The theory of an implicit social contract also goes under the principles of explicit consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.itgovernance.eu/blog/en/gaining-explicit-consent-under-the-gdpr-2/|title=Gaining explicit consent under the GDPR|date=2017-07-05|work=IT Governance Blog|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main difference between Tacit consent and explicit consent is that explicit consent is meant to leave no room for misinterpretation.  Moreover, you should directly state what it is that you want and the person has to respond in a concise manner that either confirms or denies the proposition.

===Voluntarism===
According to the will theory of contract, a contract is not presumed valid unless all parties voluntarily agree to it, either tacitly or explicitly, without coercion. [[Lysander Spooner]], a 19th-century lawyer and staunch supporter of a right of contract between individuals, argued in his essay ''[[No Treason]]'' that a supposed social contract cannot be used to justify governmental actions such as taxation because government will initiate force against anyone who does not wish to enter into such a contract. As a result, he maintains that such an agreement is not voluntary and therefore cannot be considered a legitimate contract at all.

Modern Anglo-American law, like European civil law, is based on a will theory of contract, according to which all terms of a contract are binding on the parties because they chose those terms for themselves. This was less true when Hobbes wrote ''Leviathan''; at that time more importance was attached to consideration, meaning a mutual exchange of benefits necessary to the formation of a valid contract, and most contracts had implicit terms that arose from the nature of the contractual relationship rather than from the choices made by the parties. Accordingly, it has been argued that social contract theory is more consistent with the contract law of the time of Hobbes and Locke than with the contract law of our time, and that certain features in the social contract which seem anomalous to us, such as the belief that we are bound by a contract formulated by our distant ancestors, would not have seemed as strange to Hobbes' contemporaries as they do to us.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kary, "Contract Law and the Social Contract: What Legal History Can Teach Us About the Political Theory of Hobbes and Locke", 31 Ottawa Law Review 73 (Jan. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stacey Cornell Koon''' (born November 23, 1950) is a former [[sergeant]] with the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] who became nationally notorious in the wake of the [[Rodney King]] incident.

==Rodney King incident==
On March 3, 1991, in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], a high-speed chase was initiated by [[California Highway Patrol]] officer Melanie Singer after motorist Rodney King was observed behind the wheel of a 1988 white [[Hyundai]] Excel traveling at a high speed of over 100 MPH. The chase ended on the right shoulder of Foothill Boulevard. Koon and four other officers ([[Laurence Powell]], Timothy Wind, Theodore Briseño and Rolando Solano) attempted to arrest King. The officers stated that King resisted arrest and Officers Powell, Wind and Briseño had to use force to subdue him. The incident was videotaped by a nearby resident, George Holliday, who sold it to local TV station [[KTLA]]. The station aired parts of the video and [[CNN]] aired it the next day. The police officers were tried for the use of excessive force in state court in [[Simi Valley]] in 1992 and acquitted on April 29 that year. Later the same day the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] erupted, which went on to claim the lives of sixty-three people. In 1993, the four officers were tried in a federal court in [[Los Angeles]]; Koon and Powell were convicted of violating King's civil rights and sentenced to 30 months in prison.

In his 1992 book, ''Presumed Guilty: The Tragedy of the Rodney King Affair'', Koon defended his actions and blamed the riots on the media and community leaders.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1614117_1614084_1614512,00.html|title=STACEY KOON - The L.A. Riots: 15 Years After Rodney King - TIME|publisher=time.com|accessdate=2014-10-17|date=April 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared as a guest on ''[[Faith Daniels|A Closer Look with Faith Daniels]]'' on October 24, 1992.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-10-24/local/me-564_1_king-beating|title=Koon Gets Hostile Response at TV Taping :  King beating: South-Central residents drown out sergeant's defense of officers with shouts accusing him of racism while he tries to plug his book. - Los Angeles Times|publisher=articles.latimes.com|accessdate=2014-10-17|first=Michael|last=Connelly|date=October 24, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial sentencing of officers Powell and Koon was appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court]] on the issue of whether the Federal District Court properly applied departures from the [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines]] when it granted two downward departures to 30 months from section 242 of the sentencing guidelines, in ''Koon v. United States'', [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-1664.ZS.html 518 US 81 (1996)]. 

In November 1995, a gunman, 35-year old Randall Tolbert, entered the halfway house and demanded to know where Koon was. Koon was on a holiday pass at the time. The gunman took three hostages, one of whom, 67-year old Karl Milan, he later shot and killed before being killed himself by the sheriff's [[SWAT]] team during a shootout.&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-24/news/mn-6703_1_halfway-house&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Koon eventually moved to [[Castaic, California|Castaic]], north of Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Time http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1614117_1614084_1614512,00.html#ixzz0ebcBK1G8&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he began working as a chauffeur in Los Angeles for the limousine company Music Express where his patrons have included notable people like former vice president [[Al Gore]] and actor and political commentator [[D. L. Hughley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/8327-al-gores-limo-driver-was-former-lapd-officer-in-rodney-king-beating-video|title=Al Gore's Limo Driver Was Former LAPD Officer In Rodney King Beating Video|last=|first=|date=2014-05-22|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=May 1, 2015 |access-date=May 4, 2015 |series=Real Time with Bill Maher |network=HBO |season=13 |number=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Koon and his fellow [[LAPD]] officer [[Laurence Powell]] have been used as symbols of racism in hip hop and related music. He is referenced by [[rap metal]] band [[Rage Against the Machine]] in their song "Vietnow", from their 1996 album, ''[[Evil Empire (album)|Evil Empire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rage Against the Machine. ''Evil Empire''. Epic EK 57523, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also mentioned in the [[Ice Cube]] song "[[Really Doe (song)|Really Doe]]" from his 1993 album ''Lethal Injection''. Koon was also namechecked in ''[[The Simpsons|The Simpsons']]'' episode "[[Sideshow Bob Roberts]]" by conservative commentator [[Birch Barlow]] as an example of someone "railroaded by our liberal justice system." As well, he was parodied twice in 1993 by [[Jim Carrey]] on the American sketch comedy television series ''[[In Living Color]]''.

==Education==
Koon has a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in criminal justice from California State University in Los Angeles, and a master's degree in public administration from the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Presumed Guilty: The Tragedy of the Rodney King Affair |last=Koon |first=Stacey C. |author2=Robert Deitz  |year=1992 |publisher=Regnery Gateway |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=9780895265074 |oclc=26553041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symmetric difference is &lt;br&gt;
the [[Union (set theory)|union]] [[Complement (set theory)#Relative complement|without]] the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]]:&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Venn0111.svg|40px]] &lt;math&gt;~\setminus~&lt;/math&gt; [[File:Venn0001.svg|40px]] &lt;math&gt;~=~&lt;/math&gt; [[File:Venn0110.svg|40px]]
]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''symmetric difference''', also known as the '''disjunctive union''', of two [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] is the set of elements which are in either of the sets and not in their intersection.  The symmetric difference of the sets ''A'' and ''B'' is commonly denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;A\,\triangle\,B,&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;A \ominus B,&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;A \oplus B.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the symmetric difference of the sets &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{3,4\}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,4\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[power set]] of any set becomes an [[abelian group]] under the operation of symmetric difference, with the [[empty set]] as the [[neutral element]] of the group and every element in this group being its own [[inverse element|inverse]]. The power set of any set becomes a [[Boolean ring]] with symmetric difference as the addition of the ring and [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] as the multiplication of the ring.

]]

The symmetric difference is equivalent to the [[union (set theory)|union]] of both [[complement (set theory)|relative complement]]s, that is:

:&lt;math&gt;A\,\triangle\,B = (A \smallsetminus B) \cup (B \smallsetminus A),&lt;/math&gt;

The symmetric difference can also be expressed using the [[Exclusive or|XOR]] operation ⊕ on the [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] describing the two sets in [[set-builder notation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;A\,\triangle\,B = \{x : (x \in A) \oplus (x \in B)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The same fact can be stated as the [[indicator function]] (which we denote here by &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;) of the symmetric difference being the XOR (or addition [[Modular arithmetic|mod 2]]) of the indicator functions of its two arguments: &lt;math&gt;\chi_{(A\,\triangle\,B)} = \chi_A \oplus \chi_B&lt;/math&gt; or using the [[Iverson bracket]] notation &lt;math&gt;[x \in A\,\triangle\,B] = [x \in A] \oplus [x \in B]&lt;/math&gt;.

The symmetric difference can also be expressed as the union of the two sets, minus their [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]:

:&lt;math&gt;A\,\triangle\,B = (A \cup B) \smallsetminus (A \cap B),&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, &lt;math&gt;A\triangle B\subseteq A\cup B&lt;/math&gt;; the equality in this non-strict [[Subset|inclusion]] occurs [[if and only if]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are [[disjoint sets]]. Furthermore, if we denote &lt;math&gt;D = A\triangle B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I = A \cap B&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are always disjoint, so &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; [[Partition of a set|partition]] &lt;math&gt;A \cup B&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, assuming intersection and symmetric difference as primitive operations, the union of two sets can be well ''defined'' in terms of symmetric difference by the right-hand side of the equality

:&lt;math&gt;A\,\cup\,B = (A\,\triangle\,B)\,\triangle\,(A \cap B)&lt;/math&gt;.

The symmetric difference is [[commutativity|commutative]] and [[associativity|associative]] (and consequently the leftmost set of parentheses in the previous expression were thus redundant):

:&lt;math&gt;A\,\triangle\,B = B\,\triangle\,A,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A\,\triangle\,B)\,\triangle\,C = A\,\triangle\,(B\,\triangle\,C).&lt;/math&gt;

The [[empty set]] is [[identity element|neutral]], and every set is its own inverse:
:&lt;math&gt;A\,\triangle\,\varnothing = A,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A\,\triangle\,A = \varnothing.&lt;/math&gt;

Taken together, we see that the [[power set]] of any set ''X'' becomes an [[abelian group]] if we use the symmetric difference as operation. (More generally, any [[field of sets]] forms a group with the symmetric difference as operation.) A group in which every element is its own inverse (or, equivalently, in which every element has [[Order (group theory)|order]] 2) is sometimes called a [[Boolean group]];&lt;ref name="GivantHalmos2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Givant |first1=Steven |last2=Halmos |first2=Paul |authorlink2=Paul Halmos |year=2009 |title=Introduction to Boolean Algebras |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-0-387-40293-2 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Humberstone2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Humberstone |first=Lloyd |year=2011 |title=The Connectives |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-01654-4 |page=782}}&lt;/ref&gt; the symmetric difference provides a prototypical example of such groups. Sometimes the Boolean group is actually defined as the symmetric difference operation on a set.&lt;ref name="Rotman2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rotman |first=Joseph J. |year=2010 |title=Advanced Modern Algebra |publisher=American Mathematical Soc. |isbn=978-0-8218-4741-1 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case where ''X'' has only two elements, the group thus obtained is the [[Klein four-group]].

Equivalently, a Boolean group is an [[Elementary abelian group|elementary abelian 2-group]]. Consequently, the group induced by the symmetric difference is in fact a [[vector space]] over the [[finite field|field with 2 elements]] '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. If ''X'' is finite, then the [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]s form a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of this vector space, and its [[Hamel dimension|dimension]] is therefore equal to the number of elements of ''X''. This construction is used in [[graph theory]], to define the [[cycle space]] of a graph.

From the property of the inverses in a Boolean group, it follows that the symmetric difference of two repeated symmetric differences is equivalent to the repeated symmetric difference of the [[Multiset#Operations|join]] of the two multisets, where for each double set both can be removed. In particular:

:&lt;math&gt;(A\,\triangle\,B)\,\triangle\,(B\,\triangle\,C) = A\,\triangle\,C.&lt;/math&gt;

This implies triangle inequality:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rudin |first1=Walter |date=January 1, 1976 |title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis |edition=3rd |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |isbn=978-0070542358 |page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; the symmetric difference of ''A'' and ''C'' is contained in the union of the symmetric difference of ''A'' and ''B'' and that of ''B'' and ''C''. (But note that for the [[diameter]] of the symmetric difference the triangle inequality does not hold.)

Intersection [[distributivity|distributes]] over symmetric difference:
:&lt;math&gt;A \cap (B\,\triangle\,C) = (A \cap B)\,\triangle\,(A \cap C),&lt;/math&gt;
and this shows that the power set of ''X'' becomes a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] with symmetric difference as addition and intersection as multiplication. This is the prototypical example of a [[Boolean ring]].
Further properties of the symmetric difference:

* &lt;math&gt;A\triangle B=A^c\triangle B^c&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A^c&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;B^c&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'s complement,&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;'s complement, respectively, relative to any (fixed) set that contains both.
* &lt;math&gt;\left(\bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathcal{I}}A_\alpha\right)\triangle\left(\bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathcal{I}}B_\alpha\right)\subseteq\bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathcal{I}}\left(A_\alpha\triangle B_\alpha\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary non-empty index set.
* If &lt;math&gt;f : S \rightarrow T&lt;/math&gt; is any function and &lt;math&gt;A, B \subseteq T&lt;/math&gt; are any sets in &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;'s codomain, then &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\left(A \triangle B\right) = f^{-1}\left(A\right) \triangle f^{-1}\left(B\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

The symmetric difference can be defined in any [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], by writing
:&lt;math&gt; x\,\triangle\,y = (x \lor y) \land \lnot(x \land y) = (x \land \lnot y) \lor (y \land \lnot x) = x \oplus y.&lt;/math&gt;
This operation has the same properties as the symmetric difference of sets.

==''n''-ary symmetric difference==
The repeated symmetric difference is in a sense equivalent to an operation on a [[multiset]] of sets giving the set of elements which are in an odd number of sets.{{clarify|date=April 2015}}

As above, the symmetric difference of a collection of sets contains just elements which are in an odd number of the sets in the collection:
:&lt;math&gt;\triangle M = \left\{ a \in \bigcup M: |\{A\in M:a \in A\}| \mbox{ is odd}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Evidently, this is well-defined only when each element of the union &lt;math&gt;\bigcup M&lt;/math&gt; is contributed by a finite number of elements of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose &lt;math&gt;M=\{M_{1},M_{2}, \ldots , M_{n}\}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[multiset]] and &lt;math&gt;n \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;. Then there is a formula for &lt;math&gt;|\triangle M|&lt;/math&gt;, the number of elements in &lt;math&gt;\triangle M&lt;/math&gt;, given solely in terms of intersections of elements of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;|\triangle M| = \sum_{l=1}^{n} (-2)^{l-1} \sum_{1\leq i_{1} &lt; i_{2} &lt; \ldots &lt; i_{l} \leq n} |M_{i_{1}} \cap M_{i_{2}} \cap \ldots \cap M_{i_{l}}|&lt;/math&gt;.

==Symmetric difference on measure spaces==
As long as there is a notion of "how big" a set is, the symmetric difference between two sets can be considered a measure of how "far apart" they are. 
First consider a finite set ''S'' and the [[counting measure]] on subsets given by their size. Now consider two subsets of ''S'' and set their distance apart as the size of their symmetric difference. This distance is in fact a [[metric  (mathematics)|metric ]] so that the [[power set]] on ''S'' is a [[metric space]]. If ''S'' has ''n'' elements, then the distance from the [[empty set]] to ''S'' is ''n'', and this is the maximum distance for any pair of subsets.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Flament (1963) ''Applications of Graph Theory to Group Structure'', page 16, [[Prentice-Hall]] {{mr|id=0157785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the ideas of [[measure theory]], the separation of measurable sets can be defined to be the measure of their symmetric difference. 
If μ is a [[Sigma-finite|σ-finite]] [[measure space|measure]] defined on a [[sigma-algebra|σ-algebra]] Σ, the function
:&lt;math&gt;d_\mu(X,Y) = \mu(X\,\triangle\,Y)&lt;/math&gt;
is a [[Pseudometric space|pseudometric]] on Σ.  ''d&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;'' becomes a [[metric space|metric]] if Σ is considered modulo the [[equivalence relation]] ''X'' ~ ''Y'' if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mu(X\,\triangle\,Y) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. It is sometimes called [[Fréchet]]-[[Nikodym]] metric.  The resulting metric space is [[Separable space|separable]] if and only if [[L^2|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(μ)]] is separable.

If &lt;math&gt;\mu(X), \mu(Y) &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;, we have: &lt;math&gt;|\mu(X) - \mu(Y)| \leq \mu(X\,\triangle\,Y)&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
|\mu(X) - \mu(Y)| &amp; = |(\mu(X \setminus Y) + \mu(X\cap Y)) - (\mu(X \cap Y) + \mu(Y \setminus X))| \\
&amp; = |\mu(X \setminus Y) - \mu(Y \setminus X)| \\
&amp; \leq |\mu(X \setminus Y)| + |\mu(Y \setminus X)| \\
&amp; = \mu(X \setminus Y) + \mu(Y \setminus X) \\
&amp; = \mu((X \setminus Y) \cup (Y \setminus X)) \\
&amp; = \mu(X\, \triangle \, Y)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;S=\left(\Omega,\mathcal{A},\mu\right)&lt;/math&gt; be some measure space and let &lt;math&gt;F,G\in\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E}\subseteq\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

Symmetric difference is measurable: &lt;math&gt;F\triangle G\in\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

We write &lt;math&gt;F=G\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;\mu\left(F\triangle G\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;. The relation "&lt;math&gt;=\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt;" is an equivalence relation on the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;-measurable sets.

We write &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}\subseteq\mathcal{E}\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt; iff to each &lt;math&gt;D\in\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; there's some &lt;math&gt;E\in\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;D=E\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt;. The relation "&lt;math&gt;\subseteq\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt;" is a partial order on the family of subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

We write &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}=\mathcal{E}\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}\subseteq\mathcal{E}\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}\subseteq\mathcal{D}\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt;.  The relation "&lt;math&gt;=\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt;" is an equivalence relationship between the subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

The "symmetric closure" of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the collection of all &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;-measurable sets that are &lt;math&gt;=\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt; to some &lt;math&gt;D\in\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;. The symmetric closure of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is a sub-&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, so is the symmetric closure of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;F=G\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;\left|\mathbf{1}_F-\mathbf{1}_G\right|=0&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt;-a.e.

== Hausdorff distance vs. symmetric difference ==
[[File:HausdorffVsSymmetric.png|thumb|right]]
The [[Hausdorff distance]] and the (area of the) symmetric difference are both pseudo-metrics on the set of measurable geometric shapes. However, they behave quite differently. The figure at the right shows two sequences of shapes, "Red" and "Red ∪ Green". When the Hausdorff distance between them becomes smaller, the area of the symmetric difference between them becomes larger, and vice versa. By continuing these sequences in both directions, it is possible to get two sequences such that the Hausdorff distance between them converges to 0 and the symmetric distance between them diverges, or vice versa.

'''Workplace bullying''' is a persistent pattern of mistreatment from others in the workplace that causes either physical or emotional harm.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C. &amp; Keashley, L. (2005). Bullying at work: A perspective from Britain and North America. In S. Fox &amp; P. E. Spector (eds.) Counterproductive work behaviour: Investigations of actors and targets (pp. 271-296). Washington DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;  It can include such tactics as [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[nonverbal]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]], [[physical abuse|physical]] abuse and [[humiliation]]. This type of [[workplace aggression]] is particularly difficult because, unlike the typical [[school bullying|school bully]], workplace bullies often operate within the established rules and policies of their organization and their society. In the majority of cases, [[bullying]] in the workplace is reported as having been by someone who has authority over their victim. However, bullies can also be peers, and occasionally subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C., &amp; Cooper, C. L. (2006). Workplace Bullying. In Kelloway, E., Barling, J. &amp; Hurrell Jr., J. (eds.), Handbook of workplace violence (pp. 47-90). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also investigated the impact of the larger organizational context on bullying as well as the group-level processes that impact on the incidence and maintenance of bullying behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, S., Troth, A &amp; Branch, S . (2010). Work-place bullying: A group processes framework ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology'', 84(4), 799-816.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying can be covert or overt. It may be missed by superiors; it may be known by many throughout the organization.  Negative effects are not limited to the targeted individuals, and may lead to a decline in [[employee morale]] and a change in [[organizational culture]].&lt;ref name=SilentEpidemic&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201105/the-silent-epidemic-workplace-bullying |title=The Silent Epidemic: Workplace Bullying |last=Williams |first=Ray |work=Psychology Today |date=3 May 2011 |accessdate=2016-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20151121235011/https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201105/the-silent-epidemic-workplace-bullying |archivedate=21 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also take place as overbearing supervision, constant criticism, and they may work at hospice

==First known documented use==
The first known documented use of "workplace bullying" is in 1992 in a book by [[Andrea Adams]] called ''Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It''.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=workplace+bullying&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1990&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2Cworkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bworkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BWorkplace%20Bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BWorkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0 Google ngrams]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Adams|Adams, Andrea]] with contributions from Crawford, Neil ''Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
While there is no universally accepted formal definition of workplace bullying, several researchers have endeavoured to define it:
* According to Einarsen, Hoel, Zapf and Cooper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bullying and emotional abuse in the workplace: International perspectives in research and practice|authors=Stale Einarsen, Helge Hoel, Cary Cooper|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London|date=2003|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Bullying at work means harassing, offending, socially excluding someone or negatively affecting someone’s work tasks. In order for the label bullying (or mobbing) to be applied to a particular activity, interaction or process it has to occur repeatedly and regularly (e.g. weekly) and over a period of time (e.g. about six months). Bullying is an escalated process in the course of which the person confronted ends up in an inferior position and becomes the target of systematic negative social acts."
* According to [[Sarah J. Tracy|Tracy]], Lutgen-Sandvik, and Alberts, researchers associated with the Arizona State University's Project for Wellness and Work-Life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/about/wellness_and_worklife |title=Project for Wellness and Work-Life (PWWL) &amp;#124; Human Communication |publisher=Humancommunication.clas.asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210124054/http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/about/wellness_and_worklife |archivedate=10 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; workplace bullying is most often "''a combination of tactics in which numerous types of hostile communication and behaviour are used''"&lt;ref name="nightmares pp. 151-152"&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=151–152|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|doi=10.1177/0893318906291980|volume=20|issue=2|issn=0893-3189|first1=Sarah J.|last1=Tracy|first2=Pamela|last2=Lutgen-Sandvik|first3=Jess K.|last3=Alberts|url=http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/20/2/148.abstract|title=Nightmares, Demons and Slaves, Exploring the Painful Metaphors of Workplace Bullying|date=2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123204945/http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/20/2/148.abstract|archivedate=23 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gary Namie|Gary and Ruth Namie]]&lt;ref name="namiedef"&gt;Namie, Gary and Ruth [http://www.workplacebullying.org/targets/problem/definition.html Workplace Bullying Institute Definition]&lt;/ref&gt; define workplace bullying as "''repeated, health-harming mistreatment, verbal abuse, or conduct which is threatening, humiliating, intimidating, or sabotage that interferes with work or some combination of the three''."
* Pamela Lutgen-Sandvik&lt;ref name="quit"&gt;Lutgen-Sandvik, Pamela [http://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~lutgensa/Lutgen%20Sandvik%202006%20Resistance%20to%20Bullying%20CMM.pdf Take This Job and ... : Quitting and Other Forms of Resistance to Workplace Bullying] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113132410/http://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~lutgensa/Lutgen%20Sandvik%202006%20Resistance%20to%20Bullying%20CMM.pdf |date=13 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; expands this definition, stating that workplace bullying is "''persistent verbal and nonverbal aggression at work, that includes personal attacks, social ostracism, and a multitude of other painful messages and hostile interactions''."   
* Catherine Mattice and Karen Garman define workplace bullying as "''systematic aggressive communication, manipulation of work, and acts aimed at humiliating or degrading one or more individual that create an unhealthy and unprofessional power imbalance between bully and target(s), result in psychological consequences for targets and co-workers, and cost enormous monetary damage to an organization’s bottom line''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&amp;context=aglecdiss |title=Mattice, C.M., &amp; Garman, K. (June 2010).

* Employers can also be bullies. Bad employers use bullying strategically to rid the workplace of good employees to avoid a legal obligation, such as paying [[unemployment compensation]] or a worker's compensation claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abusergoestowork.com/employers-that-bully/|title=Lost in Discussion: Employers that Bully|date=4 July 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170319123420/http://abusergoestowork.com/employers-that-bully/|archivedate=19 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employers also use bullying tactics to drive out employees who demand legal pay or overtime or assert a legal right to organize collectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abusergoestowork.com/workplace-bullying-the-big-picture/|title=Workplace Bullying: The Big Picture|date=25 November 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170318001323/http://abusergoestowork.com/workplace-bullying-the-big-picture/|archivedate=18 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common type of complaint filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission involves retaliation, where an employer harasses or bullies an employee for objecting to illegal discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/charges.cfm|title=Charge Statistics|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317054201/https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/charges.cfm|archivedate=17 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Barnes, author of ''Surviving Bullies, Queen Bees &amp; Psychopaths in the Workplace'', argues that employers that bully are a critical but often overlooked aspect of the problem in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Patricia G. (2012), "Surviving Bullies, Queen Bees &amp; Psychopaths in the Workplace." {{ISBN|978-0-615-64241-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it can occur in a variety of contexts and forms, it is also useful to define workplace bullying by the key features that these behaviours possess. Bullying is characterized by:&lt;ref&gt;Einarsen, 1999; Keashly &amp; Harvey 2004; Lutgen-Sandvik, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* Repetition (occurs regularly)
* Duration (is enduring)
* Escalation (increasing aggression)
* [[Power (social and political)|Power]] disparity (the target lacks the power to successfully defend themselves)
* Attributed intent

This distinguishes bullying from isolated behaviours and other forms of [[Occupational stress|job stress]] and allows the term workplace bullying to be applied in various contexts and to behaviours that meet these characteristics. Many observers agree that bullying is often a repetitive behaviour. However, some experts who have dealt with a great many people who report abuse also categorize some once-only events as bullying, for example with cases where there appear to be severe sequelae.&lt;ref&gt;See: Thomas Sebok and Mary Chavez Rudolph, "Cases Involving Allegations of Workplace Bullying: Threats to Ombuds Neutrality and Other Challenges," JIOA, 2010, vol.3, no 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding the common understanding of bullying to include single, severe episodes also parallels the legal definitions of sexual harassment in the US.

According to Pamela Lutgin-Sandvik,&lt;ref name="cycle"&gt;Lutgin-Sandvik, Pamela, [http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/undergraduate/pdf/TheCommunicativeCycleofEmployeeEmotionalAbuse-GenerationandRegenerationofWorkplaceMistreatme.pdf The Communicative Cycle of Employee Emotional Abuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612011734/http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/undergraduate/pdf/TheCommunicativeCycleofEmployeeEmotionalAbuse-GenerationandRegenerationofWorkplaceMistreatme.pdf |date=12 June 2010 }}, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of unifying language to name the phenomenon of workplace bullying is a problem because without a unifying term or phrase, individuals have difficulty naming their experiences of abuse, and therefore have trouble pursuing justice against the bully. Unlike sexual harassment, which named a specific problem and is now recognized in law of many countries (including U.S.), workplace bullying is still being established as a relevant social problem and is in need of a specific vernacular.

Euphemisms intended to trivialize bullying and its impact on bullied people include: incivility, disrespect, difficult people, personality conflict, negative conduct, and ill treatment.  Bullied people are labelled as insubordinate when they resist the bullying treatment.

There is no exact definition for bullying behaviours in workplace, which is why different terms and definitions are common. For example, mobbing is a commonly used term in France and Germany, where it refers to a "mob" of bullies, rather than a single bully; this phenomenon is not often seen in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;LEYMANN, H., 1990. Mobbing and Psychological Terror at Workplaces. Violence and victims, 5(2), pp. 119-126&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2015}} In the United States, aggression and emotional abuse are frequently used terms, whereas harassment is the term preferred in Finland.  Workplace bullying is primarily used in Australia, UK, and Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;BARON, R.A. and NEUMAN, J.H., 1998.

== Statistics ==
Bosses are the most common bullies. In fact, approximately 72% of bullies outrank their victims.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Kinsey Goman, “Is Your Boss a Bully?” Forbes, April 6, 2014, {{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918173233/https://www.forbes.com/sites/ |archivedate=18 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }} carolkinseygoman/2014/04/06/is-your-boss-a-bully/&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics&lt;ref name="genderstats"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.workplacebullying.org/research.html |title=The 2007 WBI-Zogby Survey |publisher=Workplacebullying.org |date=29 April 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107071240/http://www.workplacebullying.org/research.html |archivedate=7 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the 2007 WBI-Zogby survey show that 13% of U.S. employees report being bullied currently, 24% say they have been bullied in the past and an additional 12% say they have witnessed workplace bullying. Nearly half of all American workers (49%) report that they have been affected by workplace bullying, either being a target themselves or having witnessed abusive behaviour against a co-worker.

Although socioeconomic factors may play a role in the abuse, researchers from the Project for Wellness and Work-Life&lt;ref name="nightmares pp. 151-152"/&gt; suggest that "workplace bullying, by definition, is not explicitly connected to demographic markers such as sex and ethnicity".&lt;ref name="nightmares pp. 151-152"/&gt;  Because one in ten employees experiences workplace bullying, the prevalence of this issue is cause for great concern, even as initial data about this issue are reviewed.

According to the 2010 [[National Health Interview Survey#Research topics|National Health Interview Survey Occupational Health Supplement]] (NHIS-OHS), the national prevalence rate for workers reporting having been threatened, bullied, or harassed by anyone on the job was 8%.&lt;ref name = alterman1&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Alterman|first1= T|last2= Luckhaupt|first2= SE|last3= Dahlhamer|first3= JM|last4= Ward|first4= BW|last5= Calvert|first5= GM|title= Job insecurity, work-family imbalance, and hostile work environment: Prevalence data from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey|journal= Am J Ind Med|volume=56|issue=6|pages=660–669|date=June 2013| pmid=23023603|doi=10.1002/ajim.22123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Dr. Judy Fisher-Blando&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lentzleadership.com/index.php?page_name=dr.judy_blando |title=The Lentz Leadership Institute LLC |publisher=Lentzleadership.com |accessdate=2012-08-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808110739/http://www.lentzleadership.com/index.php?page_name=dr.judy_blando |archivedate=8 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a doctoral research dissertation on ''Aggressive behaviour: Workplace Bullying and Its Effect on Job Satisfaction and Productivity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workplaceviolence911.com/docs/20081215.pdf |title=Workplace Bullying: Aggressive Behavior and its effect on Job Satisfaction and Productivity |last=Fisher-Blando| first=Judith Lynn|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019123522/http://www.workplaceviolence911.com/docs/20081215.pdf| archive-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific study determined that almost 75% of employees surveyed had been affected by workplace bullying, whether as a target or a witness. Further research showed the types of bullying behaviour, and organizational support.

=== Gender ===
In terms of gender, the Workplace Bullying Institute (2007)&lt;ref name="genderstats" /&gt; states that women appear to be at greater risk of becoming a bullying target, as 57% of those who reported being targeted for abuse were women. Men are more likely to participate in aggressive bullying behaviour (60%), however when the bully is a woman her target is more likely to be a woman as well (71%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/appointments/article6447287.ece |title=How a woman becomes a bully – The Sunday Times, June 7 |work=The Times |date=11 March 2012 |accessdate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611225342/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/appointments/article6447287.ece |archivedate=11 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the research of Samnani and Singh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Samnani|first1=Al-Karim|last2=Singh|first2=Parbudyal|title=Aggression and Violent Behavior|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|date=November–December 2012|volume=17|issue=6|pages=581–589|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2012.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2012), it concludes the findings from previous 20 years' literature and claims that in terms of the gender factor, inconsistent findings could not support the differences across gender.

In a study done by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nhis/|title=CDC - Worker Health Information from the National Health Interview Survey - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|author=|date=15 December 2017|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228145656/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nhis/|archivedate=28 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the NHIS-OHS confirms the previous finding, as higher prevalence rates for being threatened, bullied, or harassed were identified for women (9%) compared with men (7%).&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

=== Race ===

Race also may play a role in the experience of workplace bullying. According to the Workplace Bullying Institute (2007),&lt;ref name="genderstats" /&gt; the comparison of reported combined bullying (current + ever bullied) prevalence percentages reveals the pattern from most to least:
# Hispanics (52.1%)
# Blacks (46%)
# Whites (33.5%)
# Asian (30.6%)

The reported rates of witnessing bullying were:
# Asian (28.5%)
# Blacks (21.1%)
# Hispanics (14%)
# Whites (10.8%)

The percentages of those reporting that they have neither experienced nor witnessed mistreatment were:
# Asians (57.3%)
# Whites (49.7%)
# Hispanics (32.2%)
# Blacks (23.4%)

Research psychologist [[Tony Buon]] published one of the first reviews of bullying in China in the prestigious Journal PKU Business Review in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Buon, T (2005). The Management of Workplace Bullying. PKU Business Review, 5, 74-79, Peking University (PRC) (Published in Chinese){{cite web |url=.http://www.buon.net/PKUBullying.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709151722/http://www.buon.net/PKUBullying.pdf |archivedate=9 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marital status===
Higher prevalence rates for experiencing a [[hostile work environment]] were identified for divorced or separated workers compared to married workers, widowed workers, and never married workers.&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

===Education===
Higher prevalence rates for experiencing a hostile work environment were identified for workers with some college education or workers with  high school diploma or GED, compared to workers with less than a high school education.&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

===Age===
Lower prevalence rates for experiencing a hostile work environment were identified for workers aged 65 and older compared to workers in other age groups.&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

With respect to age, conflicting findings have been reported. A study by Einarsen and Skogstad (1996) indicates older employees tend to be more likely to be bullied than younger ones.

===Industry===
Among industry groups, workers with higher prevalence rates of a hostile work environment, compared to all adults employed at some time in a 12-month period leading up to a survey in 2010 (8%), were in public administration (16%) and retail trade industries (10%). Lower prevalence rates of a hostile work environment were reported among those working in construction (5%); finance and insurance (5%); manufacturing (5%); and professional, scientific, and technical services industries (6%).&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

===Occupation===
For occupational groups, workers in protective service reported a higher prevalence rate (25%) of hostile work environments compared to the prevalence rate for all adults employed at some time in the past 12 months. Workers in community and social service occupations also experienced a relatively high rate (16%). Lower prevalence rates were observed among architecture and engineering (4%), computer and mathematical (4%), business and financial operations (5%), and construction and extraction (5%) occupations.&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

== Profiling ==
Researchers Caitlin Buon and [[Tony Buon]] have suggested that attempts to profile ‘the bully’ have been damaging &lt;ref name="buon.net"&gt;Buon T &amp; Buon, C (2007) The Bully Within. Counselling at Work. Summer {{cite web |url=http://buon.net/BullyingJournalArticle.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150510100132/http://buon.net/BullyingJournalArticle.pdf |archivedate=10 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They state that the "bully" profile is that ‘the bully’ is always aware of what they are doing, deliberately sets out to harm their ‘victims’, targets a particular individual or type of person and has some kind of underlying personality flaw, insecurity or disorder. But this is unproven and lacks evidence. The researchers suggest referring to workplace bullying as generic harassment along with other forms of non-specific harassment and this would enable employees to use less emotionally charged language and start a dialogue about their experiences rather than being repelled by the spectre of being labelled as a pathological predator or having to define their experiences as the victims of such a person. [[Tony Buon]] and Caitlin Buon also suggest that the perception and profile of the workplace bully is not facilitating  interventions with the problem. They suggest that to make significant progress and achieve behaviour change over the long term then, organisations and individuals need to embrace the notion that everyone must all potentially house ‘the bully’ within them and their organisations. It exists in workplace cultures, belief systems, interactions  and  emotional competencies and cannot be transformed if externalization and demonization continue the problem by profiling ‘the bully’ rather than talking about behaviours and interpersonal  interactions.&lt;ref name="buon.net"/&gt;

== Relationship among participants ==
Based on research by H. Hoel and C.L. Cooper, most the perpetrators are [[supervisor]]s. The second most common group is peers, followed by subordinates and customers.&lt;ref&gt;HOEL, H. and COOPER, C.L., 2000. Destructive conflict and bullying at work. Manchester School of Management, UMIST Manchester, UK., http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0950017010389228&lt;/ref&gt; The three main relationships among the participants in workplace bullying: 
* Between supervisor and subordinate
* Among co-workers
* Employees and customers

Bullying may also occur between an organization and its employees.

Bullying behaviour by supervisors toward subordinates typically manifests as an abuse of power by the supervisor in the workplace. Bullying behaviours by supervisors may be associated with a culture of bullying and the management style of the supervisors. An authoritative management style, specifically, often includes bullying behaviours, which can make subordinates fearful and allow supervisors to bolster their authority over others.

On the other hand, some researchers suggest that bullying behaviours can be a positive force for performance in the workplace. Workplace bullying may contribute to organizational power and control.

However, if an organization wishes to discourage bullying in the workplace, strategies and policies must be put into place to dissuade and counter bullying behavior. Lack of monitoring or of punishment/corrective action will result in an organizational culture that supports/tolerates bullying.

In addition to supervisor – subordinate bullying, bullying behaviours also occur between colleagues. Peers can be either the target or perpetrator. If workplace bullying happens among the co-workers, witnesses will typically choose sides, either with the target or the perpetrator. Perpetrators usually "win" since witnesses do not want to be the next target. This outcome encourages perpetrators to continue their bullying behaviour. In addition, the sense of the injustice experienced by a target might lead that person to become another perpetrator who bullies other colleagues who have less power than they do, thereby proliferating bullying in the organization.

Maarit Varitia, a workplace bullying researcher, found that 20% of interviewees who experienced workplace bullying attributed their being targeted to their differences from others.&lt;ref&gt;MAARIT VARTIA, 1996. The sources of bullying–psychological work environment and organizational climate. European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, 5(2), pp. 203-214&lt;/ref&gt;

The third relationship in the workplace is between employees and customers. Although less frequent, such cases play a significant role in the efficiency of the organization. Overly stressed or distressed employees may be less able to perform optimally and can impact the quality of service overall.

The fourth relationship in the workplace is between the organization or system and its employees. An article by Andreas Liefooghe (2012) notes that many employees describe their employer as a "bully."

These cases, the issue is not simply an organizational culture or environmental factors facilitating bullying, but bullying-like behaviour by an employer against an employee. Tremendous power imbalances between an organization and its employees enables the employer to "legitimately exercise" power (e.g., by monitoring and controlling employees) in a manner consistent with bullying.

Although the terminology of bullying traditionally implies an interpersonal relationship between the perpetrator and target, organizations' or other collectives' actions can constitute bullying both by definition and in their impacts on targets. However, while defining bullying as an interpersonal phenomenon is considered legitimate, classifying incidences of employer exploitation, retaliation, or other abuses of power against an employee as a form of bullying is often not taken as seriously.

== Organizational culture ==
{{Main|Organizational culture|Bullying culture}}
Bullying is seen to be prevalent in organizations where employees and managers feel that
they have the support, or at least the implicit blessing of senior managers to carry on their abusive
and bullying behaviour.&lt;ref name=SilentEpidemic/&gt; Furthermore, new managers will quickly come to view this form of behaviour as
acceptable and normal if they see others get away with it and are even rewarded for it.&lt;ref name="Salin D 2010"&gt;Salin D, Helge H "Organizational Causes of Workplace Bullying" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

When bullying happens at the highest levels, the effects may be far reaching. People may be bullied irrespective of their organizational status or rank, including senior managers, which indicates the possibility of a negative domino effect, where bullying may cascade downwards, as the targeted supervisors might offload their own [[aggression]] onto their subordinates. In such situations, a bullying scenario in the [[boardroom]] may actually threaten the [[productivity]] of the entire organisation.&lt;ref name=Organisational&gt;Helge H, Sheehan MJ, Cooper CL, Einarsen S "Organisational Effects of Workplace Bullying" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographical culture ==
{{Main|Culture}}
Research investigating the acceptability of the bullying behaviour across different cultures (e.g.g Power et al., 2013) clearly shows that culture matters here. One's culture affects the perception of the acceptable behaviour. 
One's national background also influences the prevalence of workplace bullying (Harvey et al., 2009; Hoel et al., 1999; Lutgen-Sandvik et al., 2007).

Humane orientation is negatively associated with the acceptability of bullying for WRB (Work related bullying).
Performance orientation is positively associated with the acceptance of bullying. Future orientation is negatively associated with the acceptability of bullying. A culture of femininity suggests that individuals who live and work in this kind of culture tend to value [[interpersonal relationships]] to a greater degree.

Three broad dimensions  have been mentioned in relation to workplace bullying: power distance; masculinity versus femininity; and [[individualism]] versus [[collectivism]] (Lutgen-Sandvik et al., 2007).

In Confucian Asia, which has a higher performance orientation than Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, bullying may be seen as an acceptable price to pay for performance. The value Latin America holds for personal connections with employees and the higher humane orientation of Sub-Saharan Africa may help to explain their distaste for bullying. A culture of individualism in the US implies competition, which may increase the likelihood of workplace bullying situations.

==Culture of fear==
{{Main|Culture of fear}}
Ashforth discussed potentially destructive sides of [[leadership]] and identified what he referred to as [[petty tyrants]], i.e., leaders who exercise a tyrannical style of management, resulting in a climate of fear in the workplace.&lt;ref name=ashforth&gt;''Petty tyranny in organizations '', Ashforth, Blake, Human Relations, Vol. 47, No. 7, 755-778 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Partial or intermittent negative [[reinforcement]] can create an effective climate of fear and [[doubt]].&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When employees get the sense that bullies "get away with it," a climate of fear may be the result.&lt;ref name="Organisational"/&gt; Several studies have confirmed a relationship between bullying, on the one hand, and an autocratic leadership and an authoritarian way of settling [[Workplace conflict|conflicts]] or dealing with disagreements, on the other. An authoritarian style of leadership may create a climate of fear, where there is little or no room for dialogue and where complaining may be considered futile.&lt;ref name="Salin D 2010"/&gt;

In a study of public-sector union members, approximately one in five workers reported having considered [[Turnover (employment)|leaving]] the workplace as a result of witnessing bullying taking place. Rayner explained these figures by pointing to the presence of a climate of fear in which employees considered reporting to be unsafe, where bullies had "got away with it" previously despite management knowing of the presence of bullying.&lt;ref name=Organisational/&gt;

==Kiss up kick down==
{{Main|Kiss up kick down}}
The workplace bully is often expert at knowing how to work the system. They can spout all the current management buzzwords about supportive management but basically use it as a cover. By keeping their abusive behaviour hidden, any charges made by individuals about his or her bullying will always come down to your word against his. They may have a ''kiss up kick down'' personality, wherein they are always highly cooperative, respectful, and caring when talking to upper management but the opposite when it comes to their relationship with those whom they supervise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/workplace/2010-12-28-bullyboss28_CV_N.htm | last=Petrecca |first= Laura |date=27 Dec 2010| title= Bullying by the boss is common but hard to fix. |work=USA Today | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160307090535/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/workplace/2010-12-28-bullyboss28_CV_N.htm |archive-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullies tend to [[ingratiate]] themselves to their bosses while [[intimidating]] subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftlocal1904.org/bully_workshop.pdf |title= How to manage a bully boss - Council of NJ State College Locals, AFT |date=15 Oct 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313114139/http://aftlocal1904.org/bully_workshop.pdf| archive-date=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/mary-donohue/bad-managers_b_4017881.html | last=Donohue | first=Mary |title=Fighting Back Against the Tyranny of the Manager|date=10 Feb 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091303/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/mary-donohue/bad-managers_b_4017881.html | archive-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be socially popular with others in management, including those who will determine
their fate. Often, a workplace bully will have mastered ''kiss up kick down'' tactics that hide their abusive side from superiors who review their performance.&lt;ref&gt;DC Yamada (2008) Workplace bullying and ethical leadership - Journal of Values-Based Leadership, Vol. 1, No. 2, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of this ''kiss up kick down'' strategy:&lt;ref&gt;T Portis (2 Jan 2011) Understanding the Psychology of the Kiss-Up/Kick-Down Leader Lightkeepers Journal&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A bully's mistakes are always concealed or [[blamed]] on underlings or circumstances beyond their control
* A bully keeps the target under constant [[Stress (psychological)|stress]]
* A bully's power base is fear, not respect
* A bully withholds information from subordinates and keeps the information flow top-down only
* A bully blames [[Workplace conflict|conflicts]] and problems on subordinate's lack of competence, poor attitude, or character flaws
* A bully creates an unnatural work environment where people constantly walk on eggshells and are compelled to behave in ways they normally would not

==Fight or flight==
{{Main|Fight-or-flight response}}
The most typical reactions to workplace bullying are to do with the survival instinct – "fight or flight" – and
these are probably a victim's healthier responses to bullying. Flight is a legitimate and valid response to bullying. It is very common, especially in organizations in which upper management cannot or will not deal with the bullying. In hard economic times, however, flight may not be an option, and fighting may be the only choice.&lt;ref name=Killoren&gt;Robert Killoren (2014) The Toll of Workplace Bullying - Research Management Review, Volume 20, Number 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighting the bullying can require near heroic action, especially if the bullying targets just one or two individuals. It can also be a difficult challenge. There are some times when confrontation is called for. First, there is always a chance that the bully boss is labouring under the impression that this is the way to get things done and does not recognize the havoc being wrought on subordinates.&lt;ref name=Killoren/&gt;

== Typology of bullying behaviours ==
With some variations, the following typology of workplace bullying behaviours has been adopted by a number of academic researchers. The typology uses five different categories.&lt;ref name="Rayner"&gt;Rayner C, Hoel H, [[Cary Cooper|Cooper CL]] Workplace Bullying: What we know, who is to blame and what can we do? (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Peyton"&gt;Peyton PR Dignity at Work: Eliminate Bullying and Create a Positive Working Environment (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Threat to professional status''' – including belittling opinions, public professional [[humiliation]], accusations regarding lack of effort, intimidating use of [[discipline]] or competence procedures.
# '''Threat to personal standing''' – including [[Social undermining|undermining]] personal integrity, destructive [[innuendo]] and [[sarcasm]], making inappropriate jokes about the target, persistent [[teasing]], name calling, [[insults]], [[intimidation]].
# '''[[Isolation to facilitate abuse|Isolation]]''' – including preventing access to opportunities, physical or social isolation, withholding necessary information, keeping the target out of the loop, ignoring or [[Social exclusion|excluding]].
# '''Overwork''' – including undue pressure, impossible deadlines, unnecessary disruptions.
# '''[[Destabilisation]]''' – including failure to acknowledge good work, allocation of meaningless tasks, removal of responsibility, repeated reminders of blunders, [[setting up to fail|setting target up to fail]], [[Moving the goalposts|shifting goal posts]] without telling the target.

==Tactics==
Research by the Workplace Bullying Institute, suggests that the following are the 25 most common workplace bullying tactics:&lt;ref name=namie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workplacebullying.org/2013/04/19/top-25 |title=Workplace Bullying Institute Top 25 workplace bullying tactics|publisher=Workplacebullying.org |date=29 April 2011 |accessdate=2015-03-26| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808074613/http://www.workplacebullying.org/top-25/ |archive-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abusive workplace behaviours ==
According to Bassman, common abusive workplace behaviours are:&lt;ref&gt;Bassman ES Abuse in the workplace: management remedies and bottom line impact (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[respect|Disrespecting]] and [[Idealization and devaluation|devaluing]] the individual, often through disrespectful and devaluing language or [[verbal abuse]]

# Having key areas of responsibility removed or replaced with more trivial or unpleasant tasks.
Abusive cyberbullying in the workplace can have serious socioeconomic and psychological consequences on the victim. Workplace cyberbullying can lead to sick leave due to depression which in turn can lead to loss of profits for the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Randy A. Sancone &amp; Lori A.

=== Blue-collar jobs ===
Bullying has been identified as prominent in [[blue collar]] jobs including on the oil rigs, and in mechanical areas and machine shops, warehouses and factories. It is thought that [[intimidation]] and fear of [[retributive justice|retribution]] cause decreased incident reports, which, in the socioeconomic and cultural milieu of such industries, would likely lead to a [[vicious circle]]. This is often used in combination with [[psychological manipulation|manipulation]] and [[coercion]] of facts to gain favour among higher ranking [[administrator (business)|administrators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Notelaers |first=Guy |url=https://unimaas.academia.edu/GuyNotelaers/Papers/278637/Exploring_Risk_Groups_and_Risk_Factors_for_Workplace_Bullying |title=Exploring Risk Groups and Risk Factors for Workplace Bullying (Guy Notelaers) - Academia.edu |publisher=Unimaas.academia.edu |accessdate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425093442/http://unimaas.academia.edu/GuyNotelaers/Papers/278637/Exploring_Risk_Groups_and_Risk_Factors_for_Workplace_Bullying |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=April 2013}}

=== Medicine ===
{{Main|Bullying in medicine}}
Bullying in the [[medical profession]] is common, particularly of student or trainee doctors. It is thought that this is at least in part an outcome of conservative traditional [[Hierarchical organization|hierarchical structures]] and [[teaching methods]] in the medical profession which may result in a bullying cycle.

=== Nursing ===
{{Main|Bullying in nursing}}
Bullying has been identified as being particularly prevalent in the [[nursing]] [[profession]] although the reasons are not clear. It is thought that [[relational aggression]] (psychological aspects of bullying such as [[gossipping|gossiping]] and [[intimidation]]) are relevant. Relational aggression has been studied amongst girls but not so much amongst adult women.&lt;ref&gt;Richards A, Edwards SL A Nurse's Survival Guide to the Ward (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dellasega, C Bullying Among Nurses – American Journal of Nursing: January 2009 Volume 109 Issue 1 Pages 52–58&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teaching ===
{{Main|Bullying in teaching}}
School teachers are commonly the subject of bullying but they are also sometimes the originators of bullying within a school environment.

=== Legal profession ===
{{Main|Bullying in the legal profession}}
Bullying in the [[legal profession]] is believed to be more common than in some other professions. It is believed that its adversarial, hierarchical tradition contributes towards this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unswlawjournal.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/t1_le_mire_and_owens.pdf Le Mire, Suzanne; Owens, Rosemary ''A propitious moment?: Workplace bullying and regulation of the legal profession'' University of New South Wales Law Journal, The Volume 37 Issue 3 (Dec 2014)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201001112/http://www.unswlawjournal.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/t1_le_mire_and_owens.pdf |date=1 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women, trainees and solicitors who have been qualified for five years or less are more impacted, as are ethnic minority lawyers and lesbian, gay and bisexual lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalonline.co.uk/News/1009923.aspx#.VMfxpyzp-24 Society publishes guidance on tackling bullying in solicitor profession] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201001313/http://www.journalonline.co.uk/News/1009923.aspx |date=1 February 2015 }} The Journal of the Law Society of Scotland 27 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military ===
{{Main|Bullying in the military}}
Bullying exists to varying degrees in the [[military]] of some countries, often involving various forms of [[hazing]] or abuse by higher members of the [[military hierarchy]].

=== Volunteering ===

Bullying can be common in volunteering settings. For example, one study found bullying to be the most significant factor of complaints amongst volunteers 
.&lt;ref&gt;[https://probonoaustralia.com.au/news/2013/09/volunteers-report-bullying-as-major-rights-violation/ Volunteers Report Bullying as Major Rights Violation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827125805/https://probonoaustralia.com.au/news/2013/09/volunteers-report-bullying-as-major-rights-violation/ |date=27 August 2017 }} Pro bono Australia&lt;/ref&gt;  Volunteers often do not have access to protections available to paid employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safework.nsw.gov.au/law-and-policy/volunteering|title=Volunteering|first=SafeWork|last=NSW|date=|website=nsw.gov.au|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313040434/http://www.safework.nsw.gov.au/law-and-policy/volunteering|archivedate=13 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; so while laws may indicate that bullying is a violation of rights, volunteers may have no means to address it.

== Forms ==
[[Tim Field]] suggested that workplace bullying takes these forms:&lt;ref name="what"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bullyonline.org/workbully/bully.htm |last=Field |first=Tim |title=Bullying: what is it? | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512150521/http://bullyonline.org/index.php/bullying/15-am-i-being-bullied |archive-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Serial bullying''' — the source of all dysfunction can be traced to one individual, who picks on one employee after another and destroys them, then moves on. Probably the most common type of bullying.
* '''Secondary bullying''' — the pressure of having to deal with a serial bully causes the general behaviour to decline and sink to the lowest level.
* '''Pair bullying''' — this takes place with two people, one active and verbal, the other often watching and listening.
* '''Gang bullying or group bullying''' — is a serial bully with colleagues. Gangs can occur anywhere, but flourish in corporate bullying climates. It is often called [[mobbing]] and usually involves [[scapegoating]] and [[victimisation]].
* '''Vicarious bullying''' — two parties are encouraged to fight. This is the typical "[[Triangulation (psychology)|triangulation]]" where the aggression gets passed around.
* '''Regulation bullying''' — where a serial bully forces their target to comply with rules, regulations, procedures or laws regardless of their appropriateness, applicability or necessity.
* '''Residual bullying''' — after the serial bully has left or been fired, the behaviour continues. It can go on for years.
* '''[[Legal abuse|Legal bullying]] ''' — the bringing of a vexatious legal action to control and punish a person.
* '''Pressure bullying or unwitting bullying''' — having to work to unrealistic time scales or inadequate resources.
* '''Corporate bullying''' — where an employer abuses an employee with impunity, knowing the law is weak and the job market is soft.
* '''Organizational bullying''' — a combination of pressure bullying and corporate bullying. Occurs when an organization struggles to adapt to changing markets, reduced income, cuts in budgets, imposed expectations and other extreme pressures.
* '''Institutional bullying''' — entrenched and is accepted as part of the culture.
* '''Client bullying''' — an employee is bullied by those they serve, for instance subway attendants or public servants.
* '''[[Cyber bullying|Cyberbullying]]''' — the use of information and communication technologies to support deliberate, repeated, and hostile behaviour by an individual or group, that is intended to harm others.&lt;ref name=Summary5519228&gt;[https://www.srl.to/4hrEP8de Spacey, S. 2015. 1.

Adult bullying can come in an assortment of forms. There are about five distinctive types of adult bullies. A narcissistic bully is described as a self-centred person whose egotism is frail and possesses the need to put others down. An impulsive bully is someone who acts on bullying based on stress or being upset at the moment. A physical bully uses physical injury and the threat of harm to abuse their victims, while a verbal bully uses demeaning and cynicism to debase their victims. Lastly, a secondary adult bully is portrayed as a person that did not start the initial bullying but participates in afterwards to avoid being bullied themselves ("Adult Bullying").

== Emotional intelligence ==
{{Main|Bullying and emotional intelligence#Workplace}}
Workplace bullying is reported to be far more prevalent than perhaps commonly thought.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA&gt;Hutchinson, M. &amp; Hurley, J. (2013) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01372.x/ Exploring leadership capability and emotional intelligence as moderators of workplace bullying.] ''Journal of Nursing Management'', ''21'', 553-562. DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01372.x&lt;/ref&gt; For some reason, workplace bullying seems to be particularly widespread in healthcare organizations; 80% of nurses report experiencing workplace bullying.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; Similar to the school environment for children, the work environment typically places groups of adult peers together in a shared space on a regular basis. In such a situation, social interactions and relationships are of great importance to the function of the [[organizational structure]] and in pursuing [[goal]]s. The emotional consequences of bullying put an organization at risk of losing victimized employees.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; Bullying also contributes to a negative work environment, is not conducive to necessary cooperation and can lessen productivity at various levels.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; Bullying in the workplace is associated with negative responses to stress.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; The ability to manage emotions, especially emotional [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], seems to be a consistently important factor in different types of bullying. The workplace in general can be a stressful environment, so a negative way of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with stress or an inability to do so can be particularly damning. Workplace bullies may have high [[social intelligence]] and low [[emotional intelligence]] (EI).&lt;ref name=HutchinsonB&gt;Hutchinson, M. (2013) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01390.x/ Bullying as workgroup manipulation: a model for understanding patterns of victimization and contagion within the workgroup.] ''Journal of Nursing Management'', ''21'', 563-571. DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01390.x&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, bullies tend to rank high on the social ladder and are adept at [[Social influence|influencing]] others. The combination of high social intelligence and low empathy is conducive to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] behaviour, such that Hutchinson (2013) describes workplace bullying to be.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonB /&gt; In working groups where employees have low EI, workers can be [[persuaded]] to engage in unethical behaviour.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonB /&gt; With the bullies' persuasion, the work group is socialized in a way that [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalizes]] the behaviour, and makes the group tolerant or supportive of the bullying.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonB /&gt; Hutchinson &amp; Hurley (2013) make the case that EI and [[leadership]] skills are both necessary to bullying intervention in the workplace, and illustrates the relationship between EI, leadership and reductions in bullying. EI and ethical behaviour among other members of the work team have been shown to have a significant impact on ethical behaviour of nursing teams.&lt;ref&gt;Deshpande, S.P., &amp; Joseph, J.

DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01372.x&lt;/ref&gt; Higher EI is linked to improvements in the work environment and is an important moderator between conflict and reactions to conflict in the workplace.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; The [[self-awareness]] and self-management dimensions of EI have both been illustrated to have strong positive correlations with effective leadership and the specific leadership ability to build healthy work environments and work culture.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt;

== Related concepts  ==

=== Abusive supervision  ===
{{Main|Abusive supervision}}
Abusive supervision overlaps with workplace bullying in the workplace context. Research suggests that 75% of workplace bullying incidents are perpetrated by hierarchically superior agents. Abusive supervision differs from related constructs such as supervisor bullying and undermining in that it does not describe the intentions or objectives of the supervisor.&lt;ref name=Tepper&gt;Tepper BJ Abusive supervision in work organizations: Review, synthesis, and research agenda Journal of Management June 2007 Vol 33 no 3 P261-289&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power and control===
{{Main|Abusive power and control}}
A power and control model has been developed for the workplace, divided into the following categories:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aidv-usa.com/wheel.html Power &amp; Control in the Workplace] American Institute on Domestic Violence&lt;/ref&gt;
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* overt actions

=== Workplace mobbing ===
{{Main|Workplace mobbing}}
Workplace mobbing overlaps with workplace bullying. The concept originated from the study of animal behaviour. It concentrates on bullying by a group.

=== Workplace incivility ===
{{Main|Workplace incivility}}
Workplace bullying overlaps to some degree with workplace incivility but tends to encompass more intense and typically repeated acts of disregard and rudeness. Negative spirals of increasing incivility between organizational members can result in bullying,&lt;ref&gt;Beale, D. (2001). Monitoring bullying in the workplace. In N. Tehrani (Ed.), Building a culture of respect, managing bullying at work.&lt;/ref&gt; but isolated acts of incivility are not conceptually bullying despite the apparent similarity in their form and content. In case of bullying, the intent of harm is less ambiguous, an unequal balance of power (both formal and informal) is more salient, and the target of bullying feels threatened, vulnerable and unable to defend himself or herself against negative recurring actions.&lt;ref name="Rayner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peyton" /&gt;

== Personality disorders and dysfunctional personality characteristics==

=== Executives ===
In 2005, psychologists Belinda Board and Katarina Fritzon at the [[University of Surrey]], UK, interviewed and gave personality tests to high-level British executives and compared their profiles with those of criminal psychiatric patients at [[Broadmoor Hospital]] in the UK. They found that three out of eleven [[personality disorders]] were actually more common in executives than in the disturbed criminals. They were:
* [[Histrionic personality disorder]]: including [[superficial charm]], insincerity, [[egocentricity]] and [[psychological manipulation|manipulation]]
* [[Narcissistic personality disorder]]: including [[grandiosity]], self-focused lack of [[empathy]] for others, [[exploitative]]ness and independence.
* [[Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]]: including [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]], excessive devotion to work, rigidity, stubbornness and dictatorial tendencies.

They described these business people as successful [[psychopaths]] and the criminals as unsuccessful psychopaths.&lt;ref&gt;Board, B.J. &amp; Fritzon, Katarina, F. (2005). Disordered personalities at work. ''Psychology, Crime and Law'', 11, 17–32&lt;/ref&gt;

According to leading leadership academic [[Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries]], it seems almost inevitable these days that there will be some personality disorders in a senior management team.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred F. R. Kets de Vries, The Dark Side of Leadership, ''Business Strategy Review'' 14(3), Autumn, page 26 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Industrial/organizational psychology]] research has also examined the types of bullying that exist among business professionals and the prevalence of this form of bullying in the workplace as well as ways to measure bullying empirically.&lt;ref&gt;Salin, D. (2001). Prevalence and forms of bullying among business professionals: A comparison of two different strategies for measuring bullying. European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, 10, 425-441.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychopathy ===
{{Main|Psychopathy in the workplace}}
Narcissism, lack of self-regulation, lack of remorse and lack of conscience have been identified as traits displayed by bullies. These traits are shared with psychopaths, indicating that there is some theoretical
cross-over between bullies and psychopaths.&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;Harvey, M. G., Buckley, M. R., Heames, J. T., Zinko, R., Brouer, R. L. &amp; Ferris, G. R. 2007, ‘A Bully as an Archetypal Destructive Leader’, Journal of Leadership and rganizational Studies, vol. 14, no. 2, pp. 117–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying is used by corporate psychopaths as a tactic to humiliate subordinates.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;Clarke J Working with Monsters: How to Identify and Protect Yourself from the Workplace Psychopath (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying is also used as a tactic to scare, confuse and disorient those who may be a threat to the activities of the corporate psychopath&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt; Using meta data analysis on hundreds of UK research papers, Boddy concluded that 36% of bullying incidents were caused by the presence of corporate psychopaths. According to Boddy there are two types of bullying:&lt;ref name=Boddy&gt;Boddy, C. R. Corporate Psychopaths: Organizational Destroyers (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Predatory bullying – the bully just enjoys bullying and tormenting vulnerable people for the sake of it.
* Instrumental bullying – the bullying is for a purpose, helping the bully achieve their goals.

A corporate psychopath uses instrumental bullying to further their goals of promotion and power as the result of causing confusion and [[divide and rule]].

People with high scores on a psychopathy rating scale are more likely to engage in bullying, crime and drug use than other people.&lt;ref name=Nathanson&gt;Nathanson, C., Williams, K. M. &amp; Paulhus, D. L. 2006, ‘Predictors of a Behavioral Measure of Scholastic Cheating: Personality and Competence but Not Demographics’, [[Contemporary Educational Psychology]], vol. 31, pp. 97–122.&lt;/ref&gt; Hare and Babiak noted that about 29% of corporate psychopaths are also bullies.&lt;ref name=Snakes&gt;Baibak, P; Hare, R. D [[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has also shown that people with high scores on a psychopathy rating scale were more likely to engage in bullying, again indicating that psychopaths tend to be bullies in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Nathanson/&gt;

A workplace bully or abuser will often have issues with social functioning. These types of people often have [[psychopathic]] traits that are difficult to identify in the hiring and promotion process. These individuals often lack [[anger management]] skills and have a distorted sense of reality. Consequently, when confronted with the accusation of abuse, the abuser is not aware that any harm was done.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, P.A. (2009). The role of the consulting psychologist in the prevention, detection, and correction of bullying and mobbing in the workplace. Consulting Psychology Journal, 61(3), 169–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narcissism ===
{{Main|Narcissism in the workplace}}
In 2007, researchers Catherine Mattice and Brian Spitzberg at [[San Diego State University]], USA, found that [[narcissism]] revealed a positive relationship with bullying. Narcissists were found to prefer indirect bullying tactics (such as withholding information that affects others' performance, ignoring others, spreading gossip, constantly reminding others of mistakes, ordering others to do work below their competence level, and excessively monitoring others' work) rather than direct tactics (such as making threats, shouting, persistently criticizing, or making [[false allegations]]). The research also revealed that narcissists are highly motivated to bully, and that to some extent, they are left with feelings of satisfaction after a bullying incident occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Mattice, MA &amp; Brian Spitzberg, PhD [http://noworkplacebullies.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Bully_conference_abstract.160111428.doc Bullies in Business: Self-Reports of Tactics and Motives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425093442/http://noworkplacebullies.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Bully_conference_abstract.160111428.doc |date=25 April 2012 }} San Diego State University, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Machiavellianism ===
{{Main|Machiavellianism in the workplace}}
According to [[Gary Namie|Namie]], Machiavellians manipulate and exploit others to advance their perceived personal agendas but he emphasizes that they are not mentally ill. They do not have a personality disorder, [[schizophrenia]] and neither are they psychopaths. In his view, Machiavellianism represents the core of workplace bullying.&lt;ref&gt;Namie, G. (2006). Why Bullies Bully? A Complete Explanation.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health effects ==
According to Gary and Ruth Namie, as well as Tracy, et al.,&lt;ref name="namiehealth"&gt;Namie, Gary and Ruth [http://www.bullyinginstitute.org/research/res/2003E.html The WBI 2003 Report on Abusive Workplaces] {{webarchive|url=http://www.workplacebullying.org/multi/pdf/N-N-2003C.pdf |date=29 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; workplace bullying can harm the health of the targets of bullying. Organizations are beginning to take note of workplace bullying because of the costs to the organization in terms of the health of their employees.

According to scholars at The Project for Wellness and Work-Life at [[Arizona State University]], "workplace bullying is linked to a host of physical, psychological, organizational, and social costs." [[Workplace stress|Stress]] is the most predominant health effect associated with bullying in the workplace. Research indicates that workplace stress has significant negative effects that are correlated to poor mental health and poor physical health, resulting in an increase in the use of "sick days" or time off from work (Farrell &amp; Geist-Martin, 2005).

The negative effects of bullying are so severe that [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and even suicide&lt;ref name="abcpushed"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-02-08/suicide-waitress-driven-to-the-edge-and-pushed/323884|title=Suicide waitress 'driven to the edge and pushed' |date=9 February 2010 | website=abc.net.au | last=Caldwell | first=Alison | series=The World Today | access-date=14 August 2017 | dead-url=no | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815114447/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-02-08/suicide-waitress-driven-to-the-edge-and-pushed/323884 | archive-date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yildirim, A., &amp; Yildirim, D.

In addition, co-workers who witness workplace bullying can also have negative effects, such as fear, stress, and emotional exhaustion.&lt;ref name="quit" /&gt; Those who witness repetitive workplace abuse often choose to leave the place of employment where the abuse took place. Workplace bullying can also hinder the organizational dynamics such as group cohesion, peer communication, and overall performance.

According to the 2012 survey conducted by Workplace Bullying Institute (516 respondents), Anticipation of next negative event is the most common psychological symptom of workplace bullying reported by 80%. Panic attacks afflict 52%. Half (49%) of targets reported being diagnosed with clinical depression. Sleep disruption, loss of concentration, mood swings, and pervasive sadness and insomnia were more common (ranging from 77% to 50%). Nearly three-quarters (71%) of targets sought treatment from a physician. Over half (63%) saw a mental health professional for their work-related symptoms. Respondents reported other symptoms that can be exacerbated by stress: migraine headaches (48%), irritable bowel disorder (37%), chronic fatigue syndrome (33%) and sexual dysfunction (27%).

== Financial costs to employers ==
Several studies have attempted to quantify the cost of bullying to an organization.
* According to the National Institute of Occupational Safety Health (NIOSH) mental illness among the workforce leads to a loss in employment amounting to $19 billion and a drop in productivity of $3 billion (Sauter, et al., 1990).
* In a report commissioned by the ILO, Hoel, Sparks, &amp; Cooper did a comprehensive analysis of the costs involved in bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/safework/violence/costof.htm |title=The cost of violence and bullying at work |publisher=International Labour Organization (ILO) |accessdate=13 February 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430202909/http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/safework/violence/costof.htm |archivedate=30 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They estimated a cost 1.88 billion pounds plus the cost of lost productivity.
* Based on replacement cost of those who leave as a result of being bullied or witnessing bullying, Rayner and Keashly (2004) estimated that for an organization of 1,000 people, the cost would be $1.2 million US. This estimate did not include the cost of litigation should victims bring suit against the organization.
* A recent Finnish study of more than 5,000 hospital staff found that those who had been bullied had 26% more certified sickness absence than those who were not bullied, when figures were adjusted for base-line measures one year prior to the survey (Kivimäki et al., 2000). According to the researchers these figures are probably an underestimation as many of the targets are likely to have been bullied already at the time the base-line measures were obtained.

Research by Dr. [[Dan Dana]] has shown organizations suffer a large financial cost by not accurately [[conflict management|managing conflict]] and bullying type behaviours. He has developed a tool to assist with calculating the cost of conflict.&lt;ref name="Dana"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mediationworks.com/about-us/mti-team/ |title=Dan Dana |publisher=Mediationworks.com |accessdate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425093442/http://www.mediationworks.com/dmi/biodan.htm |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, researcher Tamara Parris discusses how employers need to be more attentive in managing various discordant behaviours in the workplace, such as, bullying, as it not only creates a financial cost to the organization, but also erodes the company's human resources assets.&lt;ref name="parris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/aboutus/wellnesspublications.shtml|title=Hugh Downs School of Human Communication&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=asu.edu|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610235556/http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/aboutus/wellnesspublications.shtml|archivedate=10 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workplace depression can occur in many companies of various size and profession, and can have negative effects on positive profit growth (McTernan, Dollard &amp; LaMontagne, 2013). Stress factors that are unique to one's working environment, such as bullying from co-workers or superiors and poor social support for high pressure occupations, can build over time and create an inefficient work behavior in a depressed individual (Evan-Lack &amp; Knapp, 2014). In addition, inadequate or negative communication techniques can further drive an employee towards feeling of being disconnected from the company's mission and goals (Hidzir, et al., 2017).  One way that companies can combat the destructive consequences associated with employee depression is to offer more support for counseling and consider bringing in experts to educate staff on the consequences of bullying. Ignoring the problem of depression and decreased workplace performance is creating an unsustainable path towards intergroup conflict and lasting feelings of disillusionment (Fischer, et al., 2014).

'''Yuanmou Man''' ({{zh|s=元谋人|t=元謀人|p=Yuánmóu Rén}}), ''[[Homo erectus]] yuanmouensis'', refers to a member of the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' whose remnants, two [[incisors]], were discovered near Danawu Village in [[Yuanmou County]] in [[Southwest China|southwestern]] province of [[Yunnan]], [[China]]. Later, stone artifacts, pieces of animal bone showing signs of human work and [[wood ash|ash]] from [[campfires]] were also dug up from the site. The fossils are on display at the [[National Museum of China]], [[Beijing]].

==Discovery==
The remnants of Yuanmou Man were discovered on May 1, 1965, by the [[geologist]] Fang Qian, who was working for the Geological Mechanics Research Institute. Based on the [[palaeomagnetic]] dating of the rock they were found in, it was initially estimated that the fossils were about 1.7 [[Megaannum|Ma]] and thus represented the earliest fossils of human ancestors found in [[China]] and [[East Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Pu | last1 = Li | first2 = Fang | last2 = Chien | first3 = Hsing-Hua | last3 = Ma | first4 = Ching-Yu | last4 = Pu | first5 = Li-Sheng | last5 = Hsing | first6 = Shih-Chiang | last6 = Chu | title = Preliminary study on the age of Yuanmou man by palaeomagnetic technique | journal = Scientia Sinica | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 645–64 | year = 1977 | pmid = 339347 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/22799956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was once thought to be possibly predated by "[[Wushan Man]]", but that has turned out to be a stem-[[orangutan]] ([[Ponginae]]).&lt;ref name="Ciochon"&gt;Ciochon RL. (2009). The mystery ape of Pleistocene Asia. Nature. 459: 910-911. {{doi|10.1038/459910a}}. This piece in Nature is based on a contribution to the forthcoming book ''Out of Africa I: Who, When and Where?'' (eds,
Fleagle, J. G. et al. Springer, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating==
The dating has been indirectly questioned by Geoffrey Pope who argued that evidence does not support the appearance of hominidae in Asia prior to 1 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey G. Pope. [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/80/16/4988 Evidence on the Age of the Asian Hominidae Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (1983)] 80:4988-92&lt;/ref&gt; (this skepticism has since lifted, with additional findings in the last 25 years). There are still, however, conflicting opinions regarding the age of the Yuanmou Fm. and Yuanmou Man. You et al. (1978) suggested that Member 4 in the upper part of the formation is [[middle Pleistocene]] and should be designated the Shangnabang Fm., while the sediments exposed at Shagou containing ''Enhydriodon'' cf. ''falconeri'' should be designated the Shagou Fm. with an age
of [[Pliocene]].&lt;ref name="Qian_et_al_1991"&gt;Qian F, Li Q, Wu P, Yuan S, Xing R, Chen H, and Zhang H (1991). [http://www.nau.edu/~qsp/will_downs/100.pdf Lower Pleistocene, Yuanmou Formation: Quaternary Geology and Paleoanthropology of Yuanmou], Yunnan, China. Beijing: Science Press, pp. 17-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Liu et al. (1983) believed the age of Yuanmou Man was [[Middle Pleistocene]], did not exceed 0.73 [[Megaannum|Ma]], and was probably contemporaneous with [[Peking Man]]. Subsequently, Qian (1985) conducted further studies of the age of Yuanmou Man, but still obtained an age of 1.7 [[Megaannum|Ma]], or [[Early Pleistocene]]. These investigations initiated beneficial discussion, although further conflicting opinions persist regarding depositional environment, paleoclimatology, glaciation, and other aspects.&lt;ref name="Qian_et_al_1991"/&gt;

According to Qian et al. (1991), palaeomagnetic dates from near where the teeth were recovered average 1.7 [[Megaannum|Ma]]. Older research by Liu and Ding (1984) noted that the faunal sequence at the site was inverted, with more extinct species in the upper levels than deeper in the deposit, and based on this evidence they suggest to put the age of the Yuanmou man into the [[Middle Pleistocene]], that is about 0.5 - 0.6 [[Megaannum|Ma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.une.edu.au/~pbrown3/yuanmou.html Inverted strata]&lt;/ref&gt;
