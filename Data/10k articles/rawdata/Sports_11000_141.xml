'''Airsoft''' is a [[Competition#Sports|competitive]] [[team sport|team]] [[shooting sport]] in which participants shoot opponents with [[airsoft pellets|spherical plastic projectiles]] launched via replica [[air gun|air weapons]] called [[airsoft gun]]s.  Airsoft is commonly compared to [[paintball]], which is a recreational [[shooting sports|shooting sport]] similar in concept but with many important key differences.

Unlike paintballs (which a paintball gun would use), airsoft pellets, or BB's, do not typically mark their target, and hits are not always visibly apparent. Though the pellets can leave red marks or "welts" on exposed skin, the game relies heavily on an [[honor system]] in which it is the ethical duty of the person who has been hit to call themselves out, regardless of whether or not anyone saw it happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abbeysupply.com/What_is_Airsoft.html|title=What is Airsoft|last=|first=|date=7 September 2018|website=|publisher=Abbey Supply|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001131550/http://zachbillings.com/what-is-airsoft/|archive-date=21 October 2018|dead-url=no|accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another difference to paintball is that all airsoft guns are [[magazine (firearms)|magazine]]-fed from the bottom, with some (especially pistols) having replaceable [[Compressed fluid|compressed gas]] (e.g. [[propane]], [[1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane]]/"green gas" or {{chemical formula|CO2}}) [[gas cylinder|canisters]].  Many airsoft guns also have mounting platforms compatible with genuine firearm accessories, and tend to more closely resemble real [[gun]]s. This makes them more popular for military simulation and historical reenactments.

Gameplay varies in style and composition, but often range from short-term skirmishes, organized scenarios, [[Close combat|close quarters battle]], field, military simulations ([[MilSim]]) or [[historical reenactment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://airsoft-facts.com/airsoft-how-to-play-1 |title=Airsoft: How to Play |website=airsoft-facts.com |access-date=6 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407053654/http://airsoft-facts.com/airsoft-how-to-play-1 |archive-date=7 April 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are played in indoor courses or outdoor fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Indoor Airsoft Field |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/blogs/jon-busdeker/os-combat-city-usa-airsoft,0,7995931.post |accessdate=20 June 2014 |work=Orlando Sentinel |publisher=Jon Busdeker |date=27 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812225158/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/blogs/jon-busdeker/os-combat-city-usa-airsoft,0,7995931.post |archive-date=12 August 2014 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combat situations on the battlefield may involve the use of military tactics to achieve objectives set in each game. Participants may attempt to emulate the tactical equipment and accessories used by modern military and police organizations.  A game is normally kept safe by trained professionals and the equipment is usually powered by gas or various types of batteries.

Before gameplay, an airsoft gun's [[muzzle velocity]] is usually checked through a [[gun chronograph|chronograph]] and usually measured in [[Foot per second|feet per second]] (FPS).  Different game sites allow a different amount of FPS, but different countries may also have a set FPS restriction, and a gun shooting over the required FPS can be confiscated or not allowed to be used on airsoft sites; for instance, a [[sniper rifle]] would usually have a higher FPS than a [[submachine gun]], since a sniper needs a minimum engagement range to reduce the danger of players being hit at close range by a powerful equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.airsoftcore.com/guns/airsoft-muzzle-speed-testing/ |title=Airsoft gun velocity / fps muzzle speed testing – what's skirmishable? |publisher=AirsoftCore.com |accessdate=13 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613234439/https://www.airsoftcore.com/guns/airsoft-muzzle-speed-testing/ |archive-date=13 June 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Airsoft originated from Japan in the early 1970s, trademarked as "soft air guns", tailoring to the needs of shooting enthusiasts while conforming to Japan's strict [[gun control]].  The name "soft air" referred to the [[compressed gas|compressed]] [[1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane|Freon]]-[[silicone oil]] mixture (known as "green gas") that was used as a propellant, which was significantly weaker than the [[carbon dioxide]] used in proper [[airgun]]s.  Originally designed for [[target shooting]], their plastic pellets can be shot at humans without causing injury and this became popular for casual war-games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airsoft-guns-gas-electric-spring.com/airsoft-history-background-of-air-soft-guns.html |title=History and Its Background &amp;#124; Where did Air Soft Come From? |publisher=Airsoft-guns-gas-electric-spring.com |accessdate=3 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712235111/http://www.airsoft-guns-gas-electric-spring.com/airsoft-history-background-of-air-soft-guns.html |archive-date=12 July 2012 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Airsoft guns spread to the UK in the late 1980s and early 1990s with a company called LS.  The guns were sold in pieces and had to be assembled before they were capable of firing pellets.  Airsoft equipment was designed to closely emulate real guns.  Since the mid-1980s, airsoft guns have been adapted with a purely recreational application in mind, and the sport is enjoyed by all ages.  Airsoft replicas are produced globally, with the majority being manufactured in Asia.  Many law enforcement agencies and military units within the United States now use Airsoft for force-on-force training drills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abbeysupply.com/blog/The_History_of_Airsoft.html|title=The History of Airsoft|date=2 March 2016|website=|publisher=Abbey Supply|archive-url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:vG7YaTprYNoJ:https://www.abbeysupply.com/blog/The_History_of_Airsoft.html+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk|archive-date=28 October 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ballistics and velocity ==
{{details|topic=Airsoft pellet ballistics|Airsoft pellets#Pellet ballistics}}
[[File:AirsoftM4Front.jpg|thumb|An airsoft player shooting from behind cover, wearing [[goggles]] to fully seal the area around the eyes and a [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]] to protect the face]]
On impact, the pain an airsoft pellet causes is directly related with the [[kinetic energy]] it has. This energy is directly proportional to its mass and the square of its velocity. It is important to note that ''doubling'' the velocity of a pellet will ''quadruple'' its kinetic energy. As a reference value, a 6&amp;nbsp;mm 0.20&amp;nbsp;gram pellet, which is the most common size and weight, traveling at {{convert|100|m/s|ft/s}} has one [[joule]] of kinetic energy.

A typical set of velocity for sanctioned fields in the United States on guns may be {{convert|350|ft/s|m/s|order=flip}} and under for Close Quarters Battle (Skirmish), {{convert|400|ft/s|m/s|order=flip}} and under for outdoor play with fully automatic Airsoft Electric Guns (AEGs), {{convert|400|-|450|ft/s|m/s|order=flip}} for semi-auto [[Designated marksman rifle|DMR]] style AEG's, and {{convert|450|-|500|ft/s|m/s|order=flip}} for bolt-action sniper rifles, for a 0.20&amp;nbsp;g pellet.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The maximum effective range of field-legal airsoft guns is all around {{convert|100|m|yd|abbr=on}} with a highly upgraded sniper rifle replica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Airsoft GI – G700F Sniper Rifle Accuracy And 250 Feet Range Test |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lSyWYj5CK8 |accessdate=10 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623215330/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lSyWYj5CK8 |archive-date=23 June 2014 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most airsoft guns used for field play will have an effective range of around 43–67 metres, depending on the intended role of the equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Section IV:  Effective and Maximum Range for 6&amp;nbsp;mm BB's |url=http://mackila.com/airsoft/atp/04-a-01.htm |accessdate=10 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150125021248/http://mackila.com/airsoft/atp/04-a-01.htm |archivedate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Airsoft guns are capable of shooting from {{convert|60|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} to {{convert|125|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}, although it is also possible to purchase upgraded internals for some Airsoft guns that will enable the gun to shoot up to {{convert|550|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on|order=flip}} or higher. In California a common limit for CQB is {{convert|350|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on|order=flip}}.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} In Ireland, Italy, and Japan the energy limit for Airsoft guns is one joule regardless of the type of game play. Some UK sites allow semi-automatic-only equipment up to 88&amp;nbsp;m/s (290&amp;nbsp;ft/s) and bolt-action rifles up to 95&amp;nbsp;m/s (310&amp;nbsp;ft/s). However, the majority of UK sites allow both semi-automatic equipment and bolt-action rifles up to 107&amp;nbsp;m/s (350&amp;nbsp;ft/s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=United Kingdom Airsoft Rules and Laws |url=http://spraythemag.com/blog/united-kingdom-airsoft-rules-and-laws/ |accessdate=17 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928192238/http://spraythemag.com/blog/united-kingdom-airsoft-rules-and-laws/ |archivedate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Northern Ireland has a maximum velocity of {{convert|100|m/s|abbr=on}} with 0.20&amp;nbsp;g pellets, without regard to the type of equipment.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} In Sweden the legal limitations of airsoft guns caps the energy limit at 10 joules for single fire guns and 3 joules for semi-automatic and fully automatic guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Luftvapen, paintball, soft air gun och övriga vapen – Lagar och regler – polisen.se |url=https://polisen.se/Lagar-och-regler/Vapen/Paintballskytte/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809210018/https://polisen.se/Lagar-och-regler/Vapen/Paintballskytte/ |accessdate=25 August 2017 |archivedate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ballistics of spring or electrically powered airsoft guns differ from real firearms in that a longer barrel will not always result in better accuracy. In spring/electric airsoft equipment, barrel length does not have a significant effect on accuracy.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The "sweet spot" for barrel length in a spring/electric powered airsoft gun is around 450&amp;nbsp;mm.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Past that length, added barrel length will not improve accuracy.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} In any case, barrel quality, velocity consistency, and hopup quality/design are more important factors with regard to accuracy.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Added barrel length will result in slightly increased velocity if the cylinder size and compression are appropriate for the barrel length. For example, a gun with a large cylinder and a long barrel will shoot slightly harder than a gun with a small cylinder and a short barrel ([[ceteris paribus]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} This rule will apply even for barrels longer than 500&amp;nbsp;mm, if there is enough cylinder volume and air compression to propel the pellet through the barrel.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} However, the resulting velocity increase will be hardly noticeable. The only considerable advantage of using a longer inner barrel in an AEG or spring powered gun is that it generally will make the gun quieter.

Gas powered replicas function more like real firearms. In gas powered guns, added barrel length (to an appropriate degree) will result in significantly increased velocity, and increased accuracy to a degree.
Tighter bore barrels will increase velocity because there will be less space between the pellet and the barrel for the air to escape through. Most stock airsoft guns have 6.05-6.08&amp;nbsp;mm bore barrels, but best performance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bestpelletgun.com |title=Welcome to BESTPELLETGUN.COM |website=''bestpelletgun.com'' |access-date=27 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801004606/http://bestpelletgun.com/ |archive-date=1 August 2015 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; is usually seen with "tightbore" barrels, which are 6.01 to 6.05 in diameter. However, the tighter the bore, the more likely the chance of a pellet jam, and subsequently, tightbores need to be cleaned regularly. It is generally agreed upon that a good quality 6.01-6.02&amp;nbsp;mm barrel will provide the highest muzzle velocity, while a good quality 6.03&amp;nbsp;mm or 6.05&amp;nbsp;mm barrel will provide the best compromise between power, accuracy, and ease of maintenance. The actual accuracy difference between tightbore sizes is debatable and usually outweighed by bore consistency.

== Safety ==
[[File:Safezone.jpg|thumb|left|Players in the 'safe zone' between games]]
Many manufacturers and retailers suggest treating an airsoft gun like a real gun at all times. This will help alleviate safety issues resulting in an accidental/negligent discharge to an unknowing target or an airsoft gun being mistaken for a real firearm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.airrattle.com/category-s/95.htm |title=AirRattle.com: Airsoft Safety Tips |access-date=5 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208194120/https://www.airrattle.com/category-s/95.htm |archive-date=8 December 2014 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most manufacturers include an orange tip on the barrel of the airsoft gun for safety purposes. Manufacturers and retailers urge consumers to not remove the orange tip of the airsoft rifle as it is used to help distinguish them from a real firearm. The orange tip serves many purposes, one of them being for law enforcement to help discern airsoft guns from real firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.airsoftprep.com/airsoft-safety/ |title=Airsoftprep.com |website=''airsoftprep.com'' |access-date=27 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018030241/http://www.airsoftprep.com/airsoft-safety/ |archive-date=18 October 2015 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimum safe level of gear required to participate in most games includes a pair of [[ballistic eyewear]] ANSI Z87.1 (impact-rated) goggles to protect participants' eyes. Traditional prescription glasses and sunglasses, or goggles not designed specifically for use with airsoft or [[paintball marker]], may break or shatter upon being struck, causing injury to the eye. Airsoft guns are not to be confused with [[BB gun]]s, which fire {{convert|4.5|mm|in}} metal ball bearings.

=== Community safety precautions ===
[[File:AirsoftG36.jpg|thumb|Airsoft replica of a H&amp;K [[G36C]]. This replica is not in use on a field, and has the magazine removed, the chamber cleared, and a barrel bag placed over the muzzle.]]
Rules such as a maximum muzzle velocity and engagement distance guidelines are used by different groups. Some organizations have created common safety rules and guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.texasairsoft.org |title=Texas Airsoft Organization |publisher=Texasairsoft.org |accessdate=13 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104141437/http://www.texasairsoft.org/ |archive-date=4 November 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When not actively playing, some fields require "barrel bags", also known as barrel socks, barrel condoms, barrel blockers, or barrel sleeves, to be placed over the muzzle of the gun. The magazine is usually removed as well, and the gun fired to clear the chamber. Most fields also require players to leave their guns set to the safety position when they are not shooting, a practice common when using real firearms. In certain countries, such as the [[Philippines]], additional special rules have been adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Filipino Airsoft Players (FAP) Standard Rules and Regulations: {{cite web |url=http://www.filairsoft.com/forum/showthread.php?t=821 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=28 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326174242/http://www.filairsoft.com/forum/showthread.php?t=821 |archivedate=26 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal restrictions ==
{{Main|Legal issues in airsoft}}
Airsoft is legal in most parts of the world. Some countries have specific restrictions,&lt;ref&gt;Complete list of Airsoft legal requirements in the world&lt;/ref&gt; such as maximum muzzle velocity and "unrealistic" coloring to distinguish them from actual firearms. They are legal throughout the United States, but restrictions do exist in cities like Chicago and Detroit. The states of New Mexico, New York and New Jersey{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}, however, do not allow airsoft guns to be used or handled publicly because of the resemblance to real firearms. They may be used on private property with the consent of the owner. The [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] FAQ page states that Airsoft guns are considered look-alike firearms which require the special blaze orange marking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/809 |title=CBP FAQ |accessdate=1 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103220250/https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/809 |archive-date=3 January 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Republic of Ireland Airsoft guns are classified as Realistic Imitation Firearms but not restricted as much as in the United Kingdom. Under the [[Criminal Justice Act]] of 2006 Airsoft guns are legal in the Republic. One can buy, sell and import Airsoft guns without notifying relevant law enforcement authorities. They do not need to be painted in fluorescent colors, they do not need to have an orange tip, but they cannot launch the projectile with a kinetic energy exceeding 1 joule. However, carrying an imitation firearm in public is prohibited, and a gun carry case is required, as for real firearms. Airsoft shops are spread over the country, and buyers must be aged 16 or over to purchase an airsoft gun. There is no age limit on Airsoft, as long as a minor has an adult's permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Which Airsoft Rifles Are Better For Youths vs. Adults |url=http://www.riflemasters.com |publisher=RifleMasters |accessdate=19 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316230703/http://www.riflemasters.com/ |archivedate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, some Airsoft guns are classified as realistic imitation firearms or RIFs. The sale, manufacture, or importation (but not gifting) of these is illegal under the [[Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006]]. A defence is allowed for selling for specific purposes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/38/section/37 |title=Specific defences applying to the offence under s. 36 |access-date=28 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043325/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/38/section/37 |archive-date=1 December 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; including airsoft skirmishing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/2606/regulation/3/made |title=Later defence of 'permitted activities' which includes insured airsoft skirmishing |access-date=28 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171127233550/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/2606/regulation/3/made |archive-date=27 November 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimum age for buying any [[Firearms policy in the United Kingdom|imitation firearm]] in the UK is 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukara.org.uk/node/18 |title=UKARA Q&amp;A |accessdate=13 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307184716/http://www.ukara.org.uk/node/18 |archivedate=7 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an offence to possess an imitation firearm in a public place without a reasonable excuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/27/section/19 |title=Firearms Act 1968 section 19 |access-date=28 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201040813/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/27/section/19 |archive-date=1 December 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example travelling to, or from, or being at an airsoft skirmish site.

Most UK airsoft sites and retailers participate in the United Kingdom Airsoft Retailer Association (UKARA) registration scheme.{{cn|date=October 2018}} A player who has participated in at least 3 skirmishes over a period of at least 56 days at the same skirmish site can be registered by that site.  Retailers have access to the database to verify that the purchaser can provide them with a defence.

As an alternative to RIFs, IFs (Imitation Firearms, including 'two tones') are available in the UK. These are RIFs which have been painted a bright colour (excluding white/silver/gold) over at least 51% of the item. No specific defence is required for selling an IF, although the minimum age for purchasing remains 18.

In Canada, there are laws pertaining to airsoft importing. All airsoft guns that are bought in Canada are legal, but when importing it, the gun has to have between 366FPS and 500FPS to pass inspection at customs, otherwise the gun will be shipped back or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/fs-fd/air_gun-arme_air-eng.htm |title=Air Guns – Royal Canadian Mounted Police |publisher=Rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=25 September 2012 |accessdate=24 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060315/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/fs-fd/air_gun-arme_air-eng.htm |archive-date=21 September 2013 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orange-tipped airsoft gun muzzles ===
Although airsoft guns in the United States are generally sold with a {{convert|6|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} or longer orange tip on the barrel in order to distinguish them from real firearms, this is not required by federal law. Manufacturers and importers may cite [[Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations]], which stipulates that "no person shall manufacture, enter into commerce, ship, transport, or receive any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm" without approved markings; these may include an orange tip, orange barrel plug, brightly colored exterior of the whole toy, or transparent construction (part 272.2, formerly part 1150.2). However, section 272.1 (formerly 1150.1) clearly indicates that these restrictions shall not apply to "traditional B-B, paint-ball, or pellet-firing air guns that expel a projectile through the force of compressed air, compressed gas or mechanical spring action, or any combination thereof."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Title 15 Part 272 Marking of toy, look-alike and imitation firearms |url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&amp;SID=c7b9dfa1176c8b46b470823f9207f044&amp;ty=HTML&amp;h=L&amp;n=15y1.2.2.8.9&amp;r=PART |work=Electronic Code of Federal Regulations |publisher=US Government Printing Office |access-date=8 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106024749/http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&amp;SID=c7b9dfa1176c8b46b470823f9207f044&amp;ty=HTML&amp;h=L&amp;n=15y1.2.2.8.9&amp;r=PART |archive-date=6 January 2015 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This language clearly exempts airsoft guns from these requirements, placing them in the same category as BB-guns, pellet, air, and paintball, none of which are conventionally sold or used with an orange tip, and many of which bear as much resemblance to real firearms as airsoft guns do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Difference between airsoft and air rifles |url=http://www.pelletguns101.com |publisher=Pellet Guns 101 |access-date=23 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420000817/http://www.pelletguns101.com/ |archive-date=20 April 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guns used in airsoft are typically imitation firearms. They have a mechanism for shooting [[Airsoft pellets|projectiles 6&amp;nbsp;mm or 8&amp;nbsp;mm]] in diameter.

Airsoft guns are classified according to their operating principle, which can be spring-loaded, electric (battery-powered Automatic Electric Guns, Airsoft Electric Guns or "AEGs"), or gas-powered (if these have a blowback feature they are known as "GBBs"). Some companies produce full replicas of counterpart [[grenade launcher]]s which fire a projectile spray of {{convert|6|mm}} pellets by use of a high-powered spring mechanism or a compressed gas propellant (i.e. green gas, propane, compressed air, or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). There is also a type of airsoft gun that is powered by a single (HPA) high-pressure [[Paintball equipment#High-pressure air or N2|air tank]] and a battery pack to power the internal FCU "Fire Control Unit" computer board. These guns are often known for their high and adjustable ROF or "rate of fire" and durability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Polarstar ROF |url=http://miairsoft.proboards.com/thread/42566 |website=MIA-Michigan Airsoft |accessdate=20 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140928084509/http://miairsoft.proboards.com/thread/42566 |archive-date=28 September 2014 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These HPA replicas are most often referred to as "PolarStars", although this refers to a popular brand of HPA engines and accessories.

Newer guns, especially those made in Taiwan and China, have metal internal and external parts. Japan has specific rules about producing airsoft guns with metal parts. A typical airsoft gun is noticeably lighter than its "real steel" counterpart due to the use of aluminum, alloy, and plastic, though some have weights in them for a more realistic feel. Smoke caps, as well as noise amplifiers, are available for certain airsoft guns to add realism.

Gas handgun magazines usually contain 10 to 30 pellets in a standard capacity magazine; however, some are high capacity magazines and can hold 50 rounds or more. In the case of AEG rifles, magazines come in either real-capacity (equivalent to the capacity of its real steel counterpart), low-capacity (10-50 rounds), mid-capacity (75-160 rounds), or high-capacity (190+ rounds). These magazines are spring-loaded. The high-cap magazines often have a ratchet wheel that can be wound up periodically to force pellets up from the holding chamber of the magazine to the feeding chute. Due to loose pellets in the reservoir, they often make a rattling noise when running or walking. Some airsoft guns have a battery-powered box or drum magazine that holds thousands of pellets, but these are usually only used and allowed on LMGs (light machine gun)type replicas.

It is common for owners to "tech" or modify their guns. The majority of gearboxes are made to [[Tokyo Marui]] specifications and have upgrade parts available. Some gearboxes are proprietary in design. It is also possible to perform DIY modifications.

=== Hop-up ===
{{Main|Hop-up (airsoft)}}
The "hop-up" system, which is installed in most stock airsoft rifles and in most pistols, is used to add extra effective range by putting [[backspin]] on the pellets. The [[Magnus effect]] causes the pellets to experience [[lift (force)|lift]] as they are shot, counteracting against gravity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abbeysupply.com/blog/The_Science_Behind_How_An_Airsoft_Hop-Up_Works.html|title=The Science Behind How An Airsoft Hop-Up Works|last=|first=|date=12 October 2018|website=|publisher=Abbey Supply|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112153255/https://www.abbeysupply.com/blog/The_Science_Behind_How_An_Airsoft_Hop-Up_Works.html|archive-date=12 November 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  A small rubber nub protrudes into the top of the barrel through a small hole, and it catches the top of the pellet as it flies past.  Adjusting the hop-up makes the nub protrude more or less into the barrel, so that backspin is increased or reduced.  Ideally, the hop-up should be adjusted so that the pellets fly as far as possible in a straight line without curving upward too far, or dropping to the ground too quickly. Hop-Up does decrease the velocity of the projectile (a gun firing {{convert|340|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} with the hop fully unwound can drop to as low as {{convert|300|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}). Ease and location of adjustment varies by gun design; some equipment provide controls that can be adjusted quickly during gameplay, while others may require partial dis-assembly. For example, a common location for Hop-Up adjustment is where the ejection port would be on a real firearm, which allows the mechanism to be covered while still allowing quick access to adjust the Hop-Up.

=== Airsoft projectiles ===
{{Main|Airsoft pellets}}
Most airsoft guns fire round plastic pellets, usually white, but black "invisible" or phosphorescent are common as well. The pellets mostly range from 0.12 to 0.48&amp;nbsp;g. However, the most popular weights for AEGs (automatic electric guns) and GBB* (Gas Blow-Back guns) are 0.20&amp;nbsp;g and 0.25&amp;nbsp;g (*These weights are generally specified for pistols whose muzzle velocity ranges from approximately {{convert|250|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} to {{convert|400|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}). Mid to high end AEGs use 0.20–0.30&amp;nbsp;g pellets, while heavier rounds (0.30–0.43&amp;nbsp;g) are typically used in long range and sniper applications since they are more stable in flight and less easily deflected by wind.

Pellets are usually bought in bags or bottles of 2,000 to 5,000, but other sizes are available, such as a 250,000 round (65&amp;nbsp;kg) package of tournament grade pellets. Biodegradable pellets are a fraction more expensive than non-bio counterparts, but many fields require them. Pellets are typically 6&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, though 8&amp;nbsp;mm pellets do exist. Pellets vary by diameter depending on the brand (e.g. Matrix pellets are 5.95&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter and let less air slip past it during travel through the barrel, whereas Crosman pellets are 5.93&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter and allow more air to slip past during travel through the barrel and allow for less velocity).  Pellets are used for the majority of play, although foam balls may be used to represent [[M203 grenade launcher]] shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arniesairsoft.co.uk/news2/14826 |title=New S-Thunder CO2 powered foam ball 40&amp;nbsp;mm grenade |publisher=Arniesairsoft.co.uk |date=3 June 2010 |accessdate=3 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101091323/http://arniesairsoft.co.uk/news2/14826 |archive-date=1 November 2012 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Customization ===
Some players customize their airsoft guns, either to improve performance or for purely aesthetic reasons. Additions include scopes, fore-grips and flashlights, [[red dot sights]] being the most commonly used. Red dot sights are used to help aim, fore-grips are used to get a better grip on the airsoft gun, flashlights (whether mounted or held in another hand) are used to illuminate dark areas and/or to blind opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://airsoft-facts.com/airsoft-equipment-1 |title=Airsoft Equipment |website=airsoft-facts.com |access-date=6 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407182608/http://airsoft-facts.com/airsoft-equipment-1 |archive-date=7 April 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though in certain countries lasers are illegal, they are popular attachments in the U.S. and Europe. [[List of laser applications#Laser sight|Laser sights ]] are more for their appearance than any practical effect, largely because they must be weak enough not to carry a risk of damaging another player's eyesight, which rules out using any laser powerful enough to produce a visible dot on the target in sunlight (although lasers can be useful for night games).

== Airsoft and military training ==
Airsoft technology is used in [[Military education and training|military training]] and law enforcement training. Due to airsoft's realism, relatively safe projectiles, and economical ammunition, it is well-suited to [[Military exercise|war games]] and scenarios to train troops. Multiple airsoft inventions were developed originally for military and law enforcement use.

Marking rounds were invented by Kerry T. Bowden to allow trainees to see where each projectile landed. Much like paintball and [[Wax bullet#Use in training|simunitions]], these marking pellets would break upon impact, marking the target with luminescent liquid. Unlike traditional plastic pellets, marking rounds are heavier to ensure breakage of the shell on impact. The weight can be adjusted by adding heavier liquid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US20140342858.pdf "Patent US20140342858 – Airsoft Marking round"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604111225/https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=patentimages.storage.googleapis.com%2Fpdfs%2FUS20140342858.pdf |date=4 June 2016 }}, "Patent US20140342858 – Airsoft Marking round." Google Scholar. 20 November 2014. Weborn 27 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Marking rounds are critical for trainees because they allow the shooter to see exactly where they hit the target. This allows them to extrapolate their mistakes and improve their aim.

Reusable grenades were improved by Scott Frank to emulate the fragmentation of a real grenade in war games and scenarios. The grenade can be loaded with paint or pellets. It uses a quick release of highly pressurized gas to break the shell and quickly disperse pellets or paint in all directions. Frank's grenade, although not the first, aimed to be as realistic and predictable as an actual grenade. He developed a more accurate timing mechanism and secondary safety mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US8485101.pdf "Patent US8485101 – Reusable Grenade."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604111116/https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=patentimages.storage.googleapis.com%2Fpdfs%2FUS8485101.pdf |date=4 June 2016 }}, "Patent US8485101 – Reusable Grenade." Google Books. 16 July 2013. Weborn 27 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Both marking rounds and reusable grenades gave airsoft the edge it needed to enter into military and law enforcement training grounds.

The airsoft guns used for training differ from civilian models. Guns manufactured for professional training are made to replicate the weight, feel and the sound of its real steel counterpart. In general, professional training airsoft guns are GBB models and enhanced with a weighted blowback mechanism to increase the force of the kick. Some are AEG's and are built with a blowback mechanism. They are also outfitted with muzzle protectors that amplify the sound to a decibel level comparable to that of a real firearm. The average FPS for professional training airsoft guns is higher than civilian models. Economically, airsoft is cheaper than simulation training. Benjamin Kratz, Fort Jackson's battalion executive officer, said that one blank M16 round can cost as much as 32 airsoft rounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mil/article/25860/soldiers-test-integration-of-popular-civilian-game-into-pre-deployment-training/ "Soldiers Test Integration of Popular Civilian Game into Pre-deployment Training."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001143602/http://www.army.mil/article/25860/soldiers-test-integration-of-popular-civilian-game-into-pre-deployment-training/ |date=1 October 2015 }}, Reeves, Steve. "Soldiers Test Integration of Popular Civilian Game into Pre-deployment Training." www.army.mil. U.S. Army, 12 August 2009. Weborn 27 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; With decreasing military and law enforcement budgets, airsoft can allow for more practice hours.

The '''Borås Arena''' is a [[football (soccer)|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Borås]], [[Sweden]]. It is the home ground of [[IF Elfsborg]] and [[Norrby IF]] and was opened in 2005. Borås Arena has an [[artificial turf]] pitch, GreenFields MX by GreenFields,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unisport.com/konstgraes/boraas-arena/{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a capacity of 14,500&amp;ndash;17,800 depending on usage. Both clubs presently using the stadium previously had [[Ryavallen]] as their home ground. Until recently it was the only stadium in [[Allsvenskan]] built in the last 40 years. The arena is located in [[Knalleland]] and is very close to the newly built athletics hall Ryahallen.

The first game at Borås Arena was [[IF Elfsborg]] vs [[Örgryte IS]] on 17 April 2005 in the top Swedish league, [[Allsvenskan]]. The game ended in a 1-0 victory for [[Elfsborg]], [[Daniel Mobaeck]] scoring the goal. The current record attendance is 17,070 and was set 4 July 2005 in a game between [[IF Elfsborg]] and [[Kalmar FF]] which marked the return of both [[Anders Svensson (footballer, born 1976)|Anders Svensson]] and [[Mathias Svensson]].

The stadium was originally scheduled to be a tournament site for the [[2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]], but a sponsorship conflict with [[Max Hamburgers|Max]] fast food chain's location at the stadium and official UEFA sponsor [[McDonald's]], plus a contractual requirement for official sponsors to have a monopoly over the stadium's area, and a refusal to close the restaurant led to it losing its status as a site for the tournament.

Borås Arena didn't only open a new era for [[IF Elfsborg]] but also for other clubs in [[Allsvenskan]], Elfsborg was the first club to build a new arena owned  by their investment company. Many other clubs have built new arenas copying the model Elfsborg set up, trying to own their arena which gives big economic resources.

==History==
[[File:Sjuharadslaktaren och Knallelandslaktaren Borås Arena.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Players warming up in the Borås Arena opening game against [[Örgryte IS]].]]
Borås Arena is a football stadium in [[Borås]], [[Sweden]], and It is the home ground of IF Elfsborg and [[Norrby IF]]. Borås Arena has an [[artificial turf]] pitch, and was changed to the most modern synthetic turf on the market during the [[UEFA Euro 2012]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elfsborg.se/nyheter/oevrigt/91-oevrigt/2724-ut-med-det-gamla-in-med-det-nya|title=Borås Arena byter konstgräs|format=|work=|accessdate=2012-06-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6J0Gy2Ijy?url=http://www.elfsborg.se/nyheter/oevrigt/91-oevrigt/2724-ut-med-det-gamla-in-med-det-nya|archivedate=2013-08-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of £500,000. The capacity of the arena is 14,500–17,800 depending on usage, 14,800 is mostly the capacity during international matches, due the fact that [[Uefa]] would not approve the installation of seats on the standing because of fire risk which means a lower capacity is needed to be approved by Uefa. Borås Arena is located next to Elfsborg's old home ground [[Ryavallen]], both of the stadiums are built together at the roofs, which means that the new stadium is still attached to the old historical Ryavallen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elfsborg.se/biljetter/boras-arena|title=Borås Arena Fakta|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first construction started on 31 December 2003 and was inaugurated April 17, 2005 at a cost of 1,120 000 £. Which was very cheap at this time considering to be Sweden's most modern stadium at that time. It was an effort by [[Borås Municipality]] that went out as a lender to Elfsborg. A necessary investment for the club and the city, Elfsborg would own their own stadium by the company [[Borås]] Arena AB and would receive all revenues without any intermediaries from matches. Borås Arena didn't only open a new era for IF Elfsborg but also for other clubs in [[Allsvenskan]], Elfsborg was the first club to build a new arena owned by their own [[investment company]]. Many other clubs have built new arenas copying the model Elfsborg set up, trying to own their arena which gives big economic resources. Borås Arena consists of four main grandstands; Knallelandsläktaren, Ålgårdsläktaren, Sjuhäradsläktaren and Elfsborgsläktaren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svenskelitfotboll.se/sefaktuellt/borasarena_juni.htm|title=Borås Arena Kostnader|work=|accessdate=2012-06-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114014845/http://www.svenskelitfotboll.se/sefaktuellt/borasarena_juni.htm|archivedate=2012-11-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first game at Borås Arena was between IF Elfsborg vs [[Örgryte IS]] on 17 April 2005 in the top Swedish league, [[Allsvenskan]]. The game ended in a 1-0 victory for Elfsborg, [[Daniel Mobaeck]] scoring the only and first goal in history on Borås Arena. The current record attendance is 17,070 and was set 4 July 2005 in a game between IF Elfsborg and [[Kalmar FF]] which marked the return of both [[Anders Svensson (footballer, born 1976)|Anders Svensson]] and [[Mathias Svensson]]. Anders Svensson also became the first on Borås Arena to score a hat-trick in the derby against rivals [[IFK Göteborg]], Elfsborg won with Anders 3 goals, 3-1. The highest attendance on an international tournament was during the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] play-off against [[Valencia CF]] where 13,148 spectators came to see Elfsborg deal with the [[Spaniards]]. Elfsborg lost with 2-1, after a goal by [[Daniel Alexandersson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bornyellow.com/html/historia_statistik/hogstapubliksiffror.htm|title=Borås Arena Publiksiffror|work= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was originally scheduled to be a tournament site for the [[2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]], but a [[sponsorship]] conflict with [[Max Hamburgers|Max]] fast food chain's location at the stadium and official UEFA sponsor [[McDonald's]], plus a contractual requirement for official sponsors to have a monopoly over the stadium's area, and a refusal to close the restaurant led to it losing its status as a site for the tournament. A strange conflict that led to Elfsborg and Borås Arena lost the championship as an arranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Borås loses out in Uefa burger battle |url=http://www.thelocal.se/13182/20080721/ |work=The Local |publisher=The Local Europe |date=2012-06-24 |accessdate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004070554/http://www.thelocal.se/13182/20080721/ |archivedate=2012-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elfsborg.se/2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217052103/http://elfsborg.se/2000|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-12-17|title=Elfsborg historia 2000-talet|format=|work=|accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the highlight in Borås Arenas young history. The year when Elfsborg received dividends on their great effort by salvaging the club's 5th [[List of Swedish football champions|SM-Gold]]. An explicit goal from the club was to win [[List of Swedish football champions|SM-Gold]] by 2007 and this was accomplished a year in advance, 5 November 2006. The association was strengthened at all levels for a couple of years, not least organizationally and financially, with new sports director "Mr. [[Elfsborg]]" Stefan Andreasson, President-elect Bosse "[[Bank]]" Johansson and two billionaires as external funders. The new highly skilled (and young)  manager couple [[Magnus Haglund]] and Peter Wettergren, who was employed before the 2004 season, was also of course in the club's big bet. The following year (2005) was also ''Elfsborg Fortress'', Borås Arena, completed while enlisted old heroes in the form of [[Anders Svensson (footballer, born 1976)|Anders]] and [[Mathias Svensson]] came back. Memorable matches this season on Borås Arena was at home the victory against [[Malmö FF]] (4-2), which many described as the best in the season and where [[Anders Svensson (footballer, born 1976)|Anders Svensson]] made the teams single best effort during the season. Another memorable match was the last and crucial one. Gold match at a packed Borås Arena against [[Djurgårdens IF Fotboll|Djurgårdens IF]] where [[Joakim Sjöhage]] became gold shooter with the only goal which meant that over 40 years of waiting was over for Elfsborg's fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bornyellow.com/html/historia_statistik/guldaren2006.htm|title=Guldåret 2006|work= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2561&amp;artikel=1019813|title=Sverigesradio Elfsborg tar guld|format=|work=|accessdate=2012-06-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130418101802/http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2561&amp;artikel=1019813|archivedate=2013-04-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chinese Taipei national rugby union team''' represents the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]) in international [[rugby union]]. Chinese Taipei have yet to make their debut at the [[Rugby World Cup]], but have attempted to qualify since [[1999 Rugby World Cup|Wales 1999]].

==History==
{{see also|Rugby union in Taiwan}}
The team is referred to as "Chinese Taipei" rather than Taiwan or Republic of China for political reasons.

The Chinese Taipei finished at the top of their Round 2 pool in qualifying tournaments for the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]], winning both of their fixtures; defeating [[Sri Lanka national rugby union team|Sri Lanka]] and [[Malaysia national rugby union team|Malaysia]]. They advanced to Round 3, where they defeated [[Hong Kong national rugby union team|Hong Kong]].

In July, 2002 Chinese Taipei was in the unenviable position of being beaten by [[Japan national rugby union team|Japan]] 155-3.&lt;ref name=Stubbs4&gt;Stubbs, p119&lt;/ref&gt; In May of the same year, [[Paraguay national rugby union team|Paraguay]] was beaten by the same margin by [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] at 152-0, however, unlike Paraguay, Chinese Taipei scored some points in their match.&lt;ref name=Stubbs4/&gt;

For qualifying tournaments for the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]] in [[Australia]], they won Pool A of Round 1, advancing to Round 2. There they faced both Hong Kong and [[China national rugby union team|China]]. The Chinese Taipei again finished at the top of the pool, winning both of their fixtures. The Chinese Taipei advanced to Round 3, however they lost their fixtures against [[Japan national rugby union team|Japan]] and [[Korea national rugby union team|Korea]], knocking them out of the tournament. Their attempt to qualify for the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] was in Division 2, Round 1 of Asia qualifying.

==World Cup record==
* 1987 - No qualifying tournament held
* 1991 - 1995 - Did not enter
* 1999 - 2019 - Did not qualify

{{2022 Winter Olympics}}
There have been '''concerns and controversies about the [[2022 Winter Olympics]]''' which will be hosted in [[Beijing]], [[China]].

==Organizing concerns and controversies==

===Cost and climate===
Several cities withdrew their applications during [[Bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics|the bidding process]], citing the high costs or the lack of local support to host the 2022 games, leaving [[Almaty]] in [[Kazakhstan]] and Beijing as the only candidate cities by 1 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3462070/olympics-winter-2022/|title=Why Nobody Wants to Host the 2022 Winter Olympics|date=3 October 2014|agency=Time (magazine)|work=time.com|accessdate=19 September 2015|first=Lisa|last=Abend}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to bid for the Olympics was controversial in China (and outside) because Beijing itself, and especially some of the proposed outdoor venues, does not have reliable snowfall in winter for snow sports. Concerns have been raised that snow may need to be transported to the venues at great cost and with uncertain environmental consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Schiavenza, "[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/07/a-winter-olympics-in-a-city-without-snow/400250/ A Winter Olympics in a City Without Snow]", ''The Atlantic'', 31 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Phillips, "[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/31/beijing-2022-winter-olympics-snow Beijing promises to overcome lack of snow for 2022 Winter Olympics]", ''The Guardian'', 31 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promotional song===
Some commentators alleged that one of the early promotional songs for the [[2022 Winter Olympics]], called "The Snow and Ice Dance," has suspicious similarities with "[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]." A Chinese media outlet cited technical analysis of the two songs: Both songs employ a piano as the major instrument, have similar prelude chords and an eight-beat introduction, and they run at almost exactly the same tempo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Didi Kirsten Tatlow|title=To Some, Beijing Olympics Song Is Suspiciously Similar to Ballad From Disney’s ‘Frozen’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/world/asia/to-some-song-of-beijing-games-is-suspiciously-similar-to-a-disney-ballad.html?_r=0|accessdate=5 August 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jiang|first1=Steven|title=Is China's 2022 Winter Olympics song too much like 'Frozen's' 'Let It Go'?|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/04/china/china-winter-olympics-song-frozen/|accessdate=5 August 2015|work=[[CNN]]|date=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental and Health issues==
===Impact on Songshan National Nature Reserve===
The environmental impact of hosting the games near Beijing has been questioned. Some of the proposed venues will be adjacent to the Songshan National Nature Reserve and part of the same mountain system, and the environmental impact on the nature reserve of construction, and artificially covering parts of the mountain with snow, is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/world/asia/water-intensive-beijing-olympic-bid-alarms-environmentalists.html Scientists Question Environmental Impact of China's Winter Olympics]", ''New York Times'', 9 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/1846273/winter-olympic-games-venues-china-pose-threat-beijing-nature Winter Olympic Games venues in China 'pose threat to Beijing nature reserve']", ''South China Morning Post'', 4 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chinese biologists lead outcry over Winter Olympics ski site|journal=Nature|date=11 August 2015|url=http://www.nature.com/news/chinese-biologists-lead-outcry-over-winter-olympics-ski-site-1.18174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship==
{{See also|Censorship in China|Internet censorship in China}}
Domestic Chinese criticism and debate on the potential environmental impacts caused by the game are censored by the Chinese government on the press and internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beijing named as host for 2022 Winter Olympics|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=11490409|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ibt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/beijing-winter-olympics-2022s-environmental-impact-includes-nature-reserve-damage-2036501|title=Beijing Winter Olympics 2022's Environmental Impact Includes Nature Reserve Damage, Critics Say |work=International Business Times|date=2015-08-03|accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/chinese-biologists-lead-outcry-over-winter-olympics-ski-site-1.18174|title=Chinese biologists lead outcry over Winter Olympics ski site|work=自然(期刊) Nature|date=2015-08-11|accessdate=2015-08-12|doi=10.1038/nature.2015.18174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dirtsurfer Parts Annotated.jpg|right|400px|thumb|Dirtsurfer with the main parts labelled.]]

'''Dirtsurfing''' is the sport of riding a Dirtsurfer brand inline board. This new [[Australia]]n [[boardsport]] is correctly known as inline boarding because Dirtsurfer is a trademark protected brand name.[http://www.patent.gov.uk/tm/t-find/t-find-number?detailsrequested=C&amp;trademark=E1560598]

A Dirtsurfer is composed of an aircraft aluminium tube frame, a laminate or composite deck and two 20in or 16in diameter BMX style bicycle wheels. Footstraps are (optionally) attached to the deck to give more control to the rider. The board is unique in that it incorporates a patented steering geometry [http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT6398237] where the front wheel pivots from a point in front of and below the axle of the wheel, via the 'Swingarm'. The rider's weight automatically centres and straightens the front wheel, creating stability and control.
Another feature of the Dirtsurfer which is not found on other four-wheeled boards is that, much like a bicycle, the stability actually increases with speed.

Inline Boarding was made an official race class by the International Gravity Sports Association (IGSA) and Gravity Sports International (GSI) in 2005. The 2005 IGSA World Cup Champion inline boarder is Nihat Uysal of Germany.[https://web.archive.org/web/20061102015252/http://www.gravity-sports.com/rankings/world_cup_rankings/2005_world_cup_rankings/2005_full_world_cup_results.htm] Nihat rides the Silver GP-X (see below)

==Models==
The first board was designated the GP (general purpose) and was available in black, red and blue colour options.
Initially it was sold without brakes, which were later made standard as an addition to the existing frame, and utilised a retro fit "calf lever" operating system.
A Limited Edition model was made of the GP, which offered a silver anodized frame, V rim wheels and a signed certificate and number.

The next board made available was the GP-X, which came with a silver anodized aluminium frame, blue anodized deep V rims, fully integrated calf brake with moulded plastic lever, increased ground clearance, disc brake caliper lugs on the frame, and disc hub on the rear wheel for easy conversion to disc brake use.

Two alternative versions to the GP-X were produced. The first, called the Road Racer, used the same frame as the GP-X in canary yellow powder coat finish, with black V rims and slick tyres.
The other was a UK specific beach racer model, with sealed bearing hubs, Black V rims, disc brake as standard, and beach tread tyres.

In 2003, Dirtsurfer introduced the Flexideck, a newer concept with an epoxy/fibreglass/maple composite deck connecting the front and rear frame to absorb jumps. Made available in powder coated lime green frame with purple anodized V rims, and disc brake as standard, it offered greatly increased ground clearance and a reinforced frame for jumping.

Dirtsurfer has updated their line-up with two new models for 2006: The Flexi Pro Downhill (DH), an updated Flexideck; and the all new Freestyle board (FS), a scaled down Flexideck with 16&amp;nbsp;inch wheels. Both models feature the new adjustable metal calf brake lever, rear disc brake, and new thermofibre deck. In addition to updating their flexideck boards, dirtsurfer also updated their line of General Purpose models (GP). Both are manufactured from HT steel. The new 16" GP comes in white, with the new braking lever and disk brakes. The new GP 20" come in black and also has the new braking handle and disk brakes.

==Movement==
A unique feature of the Dirtsurfer is that it emulates the feel of carving as on a [[snowboard]]. This is achieved by the front wheel being mounted to a single pivoting point, allowing the axle of the wheel to be above the board. Think of the idea as being very similar to riding a bike that does not have handlebars and cannot independently create speed. A Dirtsurfer comes with a leg operated brake, either as a disc or a V-Brake as used on many bicycles.

It should be noted that the Dirtsurfer will never experience a speed wobble normally associated with other bikes or board sports. Because all of the weight is below the hub of the wheel and pulls down on the hub as opposed to pushing down actually changes physics.

==Propulsion==
The Dirtsurfer can be used as a downhill sport on or off-road, using just the power of gravity. The Dirtsurfer may also be "skated" in flat areas. "Skating" the Dirtsurfer means to push yourself forward with one foot while standing on the Dirtsurfer with the other foot the way you would a skateboard. Many Dirtsurfer riders also use a kite, sail or a [[kitewing]], sometimes called wingsurfing to propel the Dirtsurfer in flat areas with adequate wind.

==Disciplines==

===Downhill===
This discipline is similar to mountain biking, where the Dirtsurfer is ridden off-road down varying grades of tracks, from forest roads to technical singletrack.

===Road Riding===
Many Dirtsurfer riders enjoy the fluid feel of carving down long asphalt roads, usually found in mountainous areas. High speeds at over 70&amp;nbsp;mph have been achieved, with riders limited only by turns in the road and their own sanity (and, to a lesser extent, speed limits). Boards are often modified with slick tyres for this purpose.  Riders are often found wearing motorcycle leathers and full face helmets to try to prevent road rash in the event of an accident.  An international race circuit has been growing since 2001 with major events held annually in Canada, the US, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany and Austria.

===Kiting===
Dirtsurfing with a kite or [[kitewing]] is called wingsurfing and is performed on flat open spaces such as beaches or fields.  Utilizing the wind, riders can achieve incredible air time and perform tricks that would otherwise require a massive ramp.  It is even possible to ride uphill with sufficient wind. Unlike powerkiting with a mountain board, the Dirtsurfer is unidirectional; that is, it only goes one direction.  However, it is possible, using the power of a kite or kitewing, to tack and gybe, much like a boat or windsurfer to change direction.  Unlike a windsurfer however, it is not practical to change sides when coming to the end of a run in one direction. To overcome this, most riders can make the transition from "heel-side" to "toe-side". Riding toe-side means that your toes not your heels, point towards the floor as you lean forward into the wind, with your kitewing or kite behind you.  This is not as difficult as it sounds.  Due to the gyroscopic stability of the Dirtsurfer, speed is limited only by the wind, with recorded speeds well over 40&amp;nbsp;mph on a flat surface.

==Equipment==
*Dirtsurfer
*Footstraps: ''Vital'' for achieving a strong rider/board interface.
*Helmet: An extremely valuable piece of safety equipment. Many riders prefer the safety of a full face Helmet, and others like the comfort of a skate style lid. The choice is personal and often dependent on the rider's preferred riding style.
*Pads: Knee and elbow pads are the most widely used. They help to prevent injury in case of a fall. Wrist guards are also recommended.
*Footwear: A strong pair of shoes or boots. Skate style shoes are the favourite among dirtsurfer riders as they offer comfort, strength, and padding.

The '''goal line''' is the chalked or painted line dividing the [[end zone]] from the field of play in [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]]. It is the line that must be crossed in order to score a [[touchdown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WQx5oq-i4ZoC&amp;pg=PA5|title=Football Made Simple: A Spectator's Guide|first1=Dave|last1=Ominsky|first2=P. J.|last2=Harari|date=1 September 2002|publisher=First Base Sports, Inc.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If any part of the ball reaches any part of the imaginary vertical plane transected by this line while [[out-of-bounds|in-bounds]] and in possession of a player whose team is striving toward that end of the field, this is considered a touchdown and scores six points for the team whose player has advanced the ball to, or recovered the ball in, this position. This is in contrast with other sports like [[Association football]] and [[ice hockey]], which require the puck or ball to pass completely over the goal line to count as a score.

If any member of the [[offensive team]] is [[down (football)|downed]] while in possession of the ball behind his own team's goal line, this is called a [[Safety (American football score)|safety]] and scores two points for the [[defensive team]].

If, during the course of play, a loose ball travels past the goal line and is recovered within the [[end zone]], then it is a touchdown if recovered by the team that scores in that end zone, or a [[touchback]] if recovered and downed  by the opposing team

In the event of a kick recovered in one's own end zone, the entirety of the ball must pass the goal line in order for the ball to be considered a touchback, and to not be in the field of play.

'''Joseph J. O'Donnell Field''' is a [[baseball]] venue in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], United States.  It is home to the [[Harvard Crimson baseball]] team of [[Harvard University]].  Formerly known as '''Soldier's Field''', the location has been home to Harvard baseball since 1898.  The venue is named for Joseph J. O'Donnell, a Harvard alumnus who played baseball and [[Harvard Crimson football|football]] while attending the school.  It has a capacity of 1,600 spectators.&lt;ref name=facil /&gt;

== History ==
=== Donation and dedication ===
The land on which O'Donnell sits was donated to Harvard in 1890 by Major [[Henry Lee Higginson]]; Higginson named the site Soldier's Field after six of his friends who died fighting in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]–  James Savage, Jr., Charles Russell Lowell, Edward Barry Dalton, Stephen George Perkins, James Jackson Lowell, Robert Gould Shaw. At the site's dedication, Higginson said in an address to Harvard's students:&lt;ref name=chron /&gt;&lt;ref name=higgaddress /&gt;

:This field means more than a playground to me, for I ask to make it a memorial to some dear friends who gave their lives, and all that they had or hoped for, to their country and to their fellow men in the hour of great need—the War of the Rebellion. They gave their lives in the cause of virtue and good government, and to save our nation from the great sins of disunion and of slavery. This is what we claim for our northern men.

=== Use ===
The Harvard baseball program moved to the location in 1898; from 1884–1897, it had played at [[Holmes Field]], which Harvard also for football games and track &amp; field competitions. On April 27, 1898, in the first game played on the field, Harvard defeated [[Dartmouth Big Green baseball|Dartmouth]] 13-7.&lt;ref name=facil /&gt;&lt;ref name=chron&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology of Harvard University Baseball, 1858-2006 |url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hua01006 |publisher=Harvard University Library |accessdate=June 29, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QhSm6Hk3?url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hua01006 |archivedate=June 29, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=higgaddress&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry Lee Higginson's Soldiers Field Address |url=http://dragoon1st.tripod.com/cw/files/hlh_soldiers_field.html |accessdate=June 29, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QhTb9Pf8?url=http://dragoon1st.tripod.com/cw/files/hlh_soldiers_field.html |archivedate=June 29, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] against Dartmouth on May 4, 1997, the field was dedicated to Joseph J. O'Donnell, Harvard class of 1967.  O'Donnell played baseball and football at Harvard, captaining the baseball team during his senior season.  He donated [[USD|$]]2.5 million to the baseball program in 1995, allowing it to hire a head coach on a full-time basis.&lt;ref name=ded1997&gt;{{cite web|title=The Harvard University Gazette|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/1997/05.08/HarvardDedicate.html|work=News.Harvard.edu|accessdate=16 May 2012|date=8 May 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, O'Donnell donated an additional $30 million to the university.&lt;ref name=2012gift&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Colin A.|title=Harvard Receives $30 Million Gift from Boston Businessman Joseph O’Donnell, Wife Kathy|url=http://www.boston.com/Boston/metrodesk/2012/03/harvard-receives-million-gift-from-boston-businessman-joseph-donnell-wife-kathy/mIdq0grBbRXmH1Aj1cPDXO/story.html|work=Boston.com|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=16 May 2012|date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1998 Harvard team had a 15-0 record at O'Donnell Field and is the only team in program history to have an undefeated home record.&lt;ref name=facil /&gt;

== Features ==
The field features a natural grass surface, [[bullpen]]s, and shrubbery beyond the outfield fence.  Bleacher seating is located behind [[home plate]] and on the [[first base]] side of the field.&lt;ref name=facil /&gt;  In 2004, a new backstop and [[Dugout (baseball)|dugouts]] were added to the field.  Additionally, the height of the outfield fence was raised from three feet to four feet.&lt;ref name=2004renovs&gt;{{cite web|last=McGinn|first=Timothy J.|title=New Dugouts Headline Capital Improvements at O'Donnell Field|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/6/25/new-dugouts-headline-capital-improvements-at/|work=TheCrimson.com|accessdate=16 May 2012|date=25 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kim Jong-hun''' (born September 1, 1956) is a retired North Korean [[Association football|football]] player and the former head coach of the [[North Korea national football team]]. He led the nation's team to and during the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].

== Biography ==
As a player, Kim Jong-hun has spent his career at [[April 25 Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=FIFAOfficialProfile&gt;{{Citation|title=KIM Jong Hun |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/teams/team=43821/coach.html |publisher=[[FIFA]] |accessdate=2010-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615215613/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/teams/team%3D43821/coach.html |archivedate=2010-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was capped four times for North Korea during the qualifications for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup]]s.&lt;ref name=FIFAOfficialProfile /&gt;

After ending his player career, Kim became a manager. He managed April 25 Sports Team until 2007, when he became the manager of North Korea national team.&lt;ref name=FIFAOfficialProfile /&gt; In 2009, he led the team as it qualified for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], their first since [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=After 43 years, North Korea back in Europe |url=http://www.cbssports.com/soccer/story/12323646 |publisher=[[CBS Sports]] |date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Kim ecstatic as North Korea make World Cup |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=655657&amp;cc=5901 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=2009-06-18 |accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a disappointing showing at the World Cup, Kim faced harsh criticism upon his return to North Korea. [[Radio Free Asia]] reported that he was publicly shamed and condemned for hours in front of 400 people, including the North Korean sports minister.&lt;ref name="rfa"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper= Radio Free Asia | title= World Cup Team Shamed, Reprimanded | date=July 28, 2010 | url= http://www.rfa.org/english/news/korea/worldcup-07282010173446.html | author1= Moon Sung-hui | last2 = Jackson-Han | first2= Sarah }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same event, the team members were commanded to individually criticize their coach, who was accused of betraying General [[Kim Jong-un]], the country's [[heir apparent]].&lt;ref name="rfa"/&gt; The report also mentioned that he had been stripped of his membership in the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] and forced to work hard labor on a construction site as punishment.&lt;ref name="rfa"/&gt; It is however unknown whether Kim was really faced with such a violating punishment, as far as DPRK has its information mostly closed from the other world. Little is known about Kim Jong-hun's current (by October 2018) occupation, probably due to the same reason.

'''New Haven Coliseum''' was a sports and entertainment [[arena]] located in [[Downtown New Haven|downtown]] [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]]. Construction began in 1968 and was completed in 1972. The Coliseum was officially closed on September 1, 2002, by Mayor [[John DeStefano, Jr.]], and demolished by implosion on January 20, 2007.

The arena's formal name was '''New Haven Veterans Memorial Coliseum,''' but most locals simply referred to it as "New Haven Coliseum". The Coliseum held 11,171 people at full capacity, and occupied 4.5 acres (18,000&amp;nbsp;m²) of land next to the [[Knights of Columbus Building (New Haven, Connecticut)|Knights of Columbus Building]] and faced the [[Oak Street Connector/Route 34]] downtown spur.

==Hosted events==
The Coliseum hosted the [[New Haven Knights]] of the [[United Hockey League]], [[New Haven Nighthawks]], [[New Haven Senators]], and [[Beast of New Haven]] of the [[American Hockey League]], as well as the 1984 [[Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference]] and [[Yale University]]'s 2002 [[National Invitational Tournament]] men's college basketball tournament opening round games. Also, it was home of the [[Connecticut Coasters]] roller hockey team in 1993, the [[Connecticut Pride]] of the IBL from 2000 to 2001, and the [[New Haven Ninjas]] [[arenafootball2]] team in 2002. [[Ice Capades]] has also been presented at the Coliseum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Day (newspaper)|location= New London, Connecticut|date= September 24, 1975|page= 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New Haven Coliseum was also second home to Yale University Hockey, playing games sporadically at the Coliseum over the years. The U.S.A. Women's Olympic Squad played an exhibition game vs. Sweden on December 15, 2001.

Notably, in 1986, the Coliseum served as the setting for [[Van Halen]]'s multi-platinum concert film ''[[Live Without a Net (Van Halen video)|Live Without a Net]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Van-Halen-Live-Without-Net/dp/B000286S9C|website=[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]|title=Van Halen: Live Without a Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the era's most prominent musical stars also appeared at the Coliseum.

The pilot episode of [[WWE SmackDown]] was filmed at the Coliseum on April 27, 1999, and aired on [[UPN]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/archive/coliseumimplosion2|title=It was a blast (literally) to be at The New Haven Coliseum - Part 2|author=|date=|website=wwe.com|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tool (band)|Tool]] was the final musical act on August 20, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/venue/8793375+New+Haven+Coliseum|title=New Haven Coliseum|website= [[Last.fm]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final event held at the Coliseum was a [[professional wrestling]] show held by [[World Wrestling Entertainment]], one of the original attractions in the arena since 1972. The WWE considered the Coliseum its home arena, as it was—for much of its history—the closest venue to WWE's headquarters in [[Stamford, Connecticut]]. Most matches were broadcast, first on [[WTNH]], as well as on local UHF stations.&lt;ref&gt;http://toliveanddiewithnewhaven.yuku.com/topic/1967&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Construction===
The Coliseum was built to replace the [[New Haven Arena]], New Haven's prior indoor sports and entertainment venue. The Coliseum, as well as the neighboring Knights of Columbus building, was designed by the architect [[Kevin Roche]] of [[Roche-Dinkeloo]]. One interesting aspect of the arena's design was that the parking garage was built on top of the actual Coliseum structure; this was necessitated by a high water table in the area which made it overly difficult to construct sub-surface parking facilities. Though an interesting solution, this design was unpopular because of the quarter-mile helical ramps required to access the parking. Vincent Scully, the revered architectural historian at nearby Yale University, often referred to the design as "Structural Exhibitionism" in his modern architecture lectures.  Other features of the design, such as street storefronts and an exhibition hall, were never completed.

===Deterioration===
During the 1980s, the structure of the parking garages had deteriorated to the point where large canvas panels had to be attached to the outside to catch pieces of concrete that would occasionally drop off onto the sidewalk below. Renovations were made to correct that problem. The city shut down the facility in 2002 after concluding that it was a drain on city coffers. However, the city did not hold any public hearings, referendum votes, or conduct any surveys, and several groups, local stakeholders, and the Coalition to Save Our Coliseum mounted a campaign to save and renovate the Coliseum, to no avail. Others in the community supported the plan to demolish the arena. Despite Mayor DeStefano's plan to close and demolish the building within six months, it ultimately took more than four years.

Among the reasons for the Coliseum's demise was the construction or renovation (often with state money) in the 1990s of alternative comparably sized venues within the southern Connecticut market. The [[Arena at Harbor Yard]] in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] attracted a minor league hockey team, the [[Bridgeport Sound Tigers]]. The [[Mohegan Sun Arena]] was built about an hour away, and became the home of the [[Connecticut Sun]]. Many musical acts started booking the [[Oakdale Theatre]] in the city of [[Wallingford, Connecticut]] after it was upgraded and expanded. Even though the state gave $5.5 million to the arena for new paint, signage, and scoreboards, the Coliseum simply could not compete with newer facilities. Even as early as 1980 the Coliseum was decried as a "[[White Elephant]]". Mayor DeStefano also had staked out a strategy of investing city resources into arts and cultural activities rather than attracting sports teams to the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhregister.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=16956394&amp;BRD=1281&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=7592&amp;rfi=6 "Nightmare in the Elm City"], ''[[New Haven Register]]'', July 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demolition===
[[Image:Demolition of the New Haven Coliseum.gif|thumb|right|200px|The controlled demolition of the New Haven Coliseum.]]
The Coliseum's demolition was delayed by the state's refusal to award the $6.5 million that the city requested{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, and the arena remained empty and darkened. The office area was used in the meantime for practice by the New Haven Fire Department.

Actual demolition work began in late October 2005 with removal of most of the arena area. At 7:50&amp;nbsp;a.m. on January 20, 2007, after years of wrangling and delay, the Coliseum was finally [[Building implosion|imploded]], using more than 2,000 pounds of explosive. It was said that the implosion could be heard all the way to [[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]] and [[Northford, Connecticut|Northford]]. As it came down, a massive cloud of dust and smoke covered the surrounding area, but blew away quickly toward the shoreline. Upwards of 20,000 people watched from the nearby Temple Street Garage and other buildings, and residents of nearby apartments were evacuated. The two helical ramps were not imploded, and were subsequently destroyed by conventional methods.

The city has tentative plans to replace the Coliseum with a new downtown/[[Long Wharf (New Haven)|Long Wharf]] redevelopment plan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofnewhaven.com/EconomicDevelopment/GatewayProject.asp|title=New Haven's Gateway Downtown Development Project|author=|date=|website=cityofnewhaven.com|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a relocated [[Long Wharf Theatre]] and a new campus for [[Gateway Community College]].

A temporary 400-space parking lot opened on the former Coliseum site on December 4, 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtnh.com/Global/story.asp?s=7448640|title=Former coliseum site opens as parking lot, WTNH Channel 8 New Haven, December 4, 2007|author=|date=|website=wtnh.com|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but plans are advancing to redevelop the site with a hotel, hundreds of housing units and approximately 40,000 sq. feet of commercial space.  The master developer, [[LiveWorkLearnPlay]] had the project approved in 2013, but construction has been delayed due to cost issues related to the moving of utilities and conflicts related to planned highway improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Leary |first=Mary |date=April 6, 2017 |title=Plans for major development at former New Haven Coliseum site delayed, not dead |url=https://www.nhregister.com/connecticut/article/Plans-for-major-development-at-former-New-Haven-11314294.php |newspaper=New Haven Register |location=[[New Haven, Connecticut]] |access-date=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 12, 2009 the Knights of Columbus filed a lawsuit against the City of New Haven, Stamford Wrecking Company and Demolition Dynamics Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2009/jan/14/knights-of-columbus-sue-city-for-damages/|title=Knights of Columbus sue city for damages|work=Yale Daily News|date=January 14, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130209214056/http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2009/01/14/knights-of-columbus-sue-city-for-damages/|archive-date=February 9, 2013|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit seeks repayment for damages incurred to the Knights of Columbus Building and Knights of Columbus Museum across the street from the Coliseum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24059">The '''personal finances of professional American athletes''' is a subject of widespread discussion due to the often high salaries of such athletes and the high rates of [[personal bankruptcy]] and other financial distress.

According to a 2009 ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' article, 78% of [[National Football League]] (NFL) players are either [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]] or are under financial stress within two years of retirement and an estimated 60% of [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) players go bankrupt within five years after leaving their sport.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1153364/1/index.htm |title=How (and Why) Athletes Go Broke |author=Pablo S.

==History==
{{asof|1911}} the average salary for the about 500 players in [[Major League Baseball]] was slightly more than $2,000 a season (${{Inflation|US|2,000|1911|fmt=c|r=-2}} today). The star hitter [[Ty Cobb]] received $9,000 a season (${{Inflation|US|9,000|1911|fmt=c|r=-2}} today), and sold automobiles in the off season. While Cobb encouraged young men to play professionally, top pitcher [[Christy Mathewson]]—who had made more money as a player than Cobb—warned, "Keep out of baseball unless you are sure of being a star!" He stated that the average player did not make enough over a ten-year career to justify devoting those years to the sport.&lt;ref name="fox191105"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcLQAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA147&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DIPgUqTJG4bpoAT1u4LAAQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;f=false | title=Baseball as the Players See It | work=Outing Magazine |date=May 1911| accessdate=22 January 2014 | author=Fox, Edward Lyell | pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1941, [[Hank Greenberg]] was the highest-paid player in baseball, earning $55,000 a season (${{Inflation|US|55,000|1941|fmt=c|r=-2}} today).&lt;ref name="life19410519"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6U4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;f=true | title=Army Inducts Highest-paid Baseball Player | work=Life | date=1941-05-19 | accessdate=22 January 2014 | pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stan Musial]]'s $80,000 a season (${{Inflation|US|80,000|1952|fmt=c|r=-2}} today) was the highest in 1952, while young star [[Mickey Mantle]] earned $10,000 a season (${{Inflation|US|10,000|1952|fmt=c|r=-2}} today). Musial, like Cobb, supplemented his income; he owned a restaurant.&lt;ref name="life19520915"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cVYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=baseball%20salary&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q=baseball%20salary&amp;f=false | title=An Old Pro and a Young One | work=Life | date=1952-09-15 | accessdate=22 January 2014 | pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Players' vulnerabilities==
Baseball outfielder [[Torii Hunter]] brought up another obstacle: "Once you get into the financial stuff, and it sounds like Japanese, guys are just like, 'I ain't going back.' They're lost."&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; It has been often suggested that baseball players study finance in college so that they can understand basic finances and contracts.

Players encourage each other to spend lavishly. [[Rod Strickland]] explained, "For rookies, it's like an unspoken initiation ... You're trying to get in good with the veterans, so you go beyond your means."&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; Friends and strangers become part of their entourages. Retired basketball center [[Danny Schayes]] stated, "Guys go broke because they surround themselves with people who help them go broke".&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3469271 |title=Life of Reilly |author=Rick Reilly |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional problem is that players can earn money in many different tax jurisdictions, and be a citizen of one country but a legal resident of another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Length of careers==
"There's a far shorter peak earnings period than in any other profession".&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; ''[[Black Enterprise]]'' reported in 2003 that "the average career span for professional basketball, football, and baseball is a mere 4.5 years, 3.2 years, and under five years, respectively."&lt;ref name=BE&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1365/is_8_33/ai_97910693/?tag=content;col1 |title=A brand new game: for these athletes, entrepreneurship is the next playing field - Entrepreneurship |author=Alan Hughes |publisher=''[[Black Enterprise]]'' magazine |date=March 2003 |accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study found that, excluding pitchers, rookie Major League Baseball players' careers last for 5.6 years on average.&lt;ref name="roberts20070715"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/sports/baseball/15careers.html | title=Just How Long Does the Average Baseball Career Last? | work=The New York Times | date=2007-07-15 | accessdate=14 April 2015 | author=Roberts, Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managers and investments==
[[Magic Johnson]] said, "They hire these people not because of expertise but because they're friends. Well, they'll fail."&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; [[Rod Strickland]] made his father his business manager. The older Strickland checked out a real estate deal from a "friend of a close friend" of Rod's, but not well enough to avoid a costly blunder.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

Hockey Hall of Famer [[Bobby Orr]] received deceitful treatment from [[Alan Eagleson]], who "as Orr's agent, left him all but broke as part of one of sports' most spectacular financial scandals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1152491/index.htm |title=The Ever Elusive, Always Inscrutable And Still Incomparable Bobby Orr |author=S. L. Price |publisher=''Sports Illustrated'' |date=March 2, 2009 |accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Malone]], another Basketball Hall of Famer has said, "You get in trouble when you let a lot of people close to you . . . I've made my share of mistakes. You've got to learn from them.&lt;ref name=Malone&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765586197/From-the-Mailman-to-a-businessman-Karl-Malone-still-delivers-the-goods.html?pg=all |title=From the Mailman to a businessman, Karl Malone still delivers the goods |first=Doug |last=Robinson |newspaper=[[Deseret News]] |date=June 26, 2012 |accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spouses, children and divorce==
When asked by one of his players "What's the most dangerous thing that could happen to us financially?", [[Carolina Panthers]] majority owner [[Jerry Richardson]] replied immediately, "Divorce."&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;  The money stops flowing in. Without a [[prenuptial agreement]],&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; [[Michael Jordan]]'s $168 million divorce settlement was at the time the largest ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,266343,00.html |title=Forbes: Michael Jordan's Divorce Most Costly Ever |publisher=Fox News |date=April 16, 2007 |accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Dikembe Mutombo]] canceled his wedding, when his fiancee refused to sign one the day before the ceremony.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

Another factor is the sexual opportunities available to athletes during their careers. Players end up being responsible for [[child support]]. [[Shawn Kemp]] had at least seven children with six women,&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; [[Derrick Thomas]] seven with five,&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; [[Jon Kilgore]] fifteen with four, and [[Travis Henry]] nine with nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=With Nine Mouths to Feed, Travis Henry Says He’s Broke |author=Mike Tierney |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=March 11, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/12/sports/football/12henry.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry was imprisoned for non-payment of an estimated $170,000 annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/10-ways-sports-stars-destroy-their-finances-2009-9#have-too-many-children-6 |title=10 Ways Sports Stars Go From Riches To Rags |author=Lawrence Delevingne |publisher=[[Business Insider]] |date=September 12, 2009 |accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

The [[National Football League]] offers its players a Financial Education Program. "The non-credit seminars are offered during the year and teach players about cash management, insurance, tax planning, retirement planning and other related topics."&lt;ref name=NFL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/playerdevelopment/finance |title=Financial Education |publisher=nfl.com |accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a more advanced NFL Business Management and Entrepreneurial Program, with "custom programs at top-rated business schools".&lt;ref name=NFL/&gt;

[[Ryerson University]]'s [[Ted Rogers School of Management]] offers a program called Breakaway, which aims to help players in their transition away from professional hockey and other sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Education for when a hockey career gets put on ice |author=Danielle Webb |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=January 5, 2011 |url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/managing/business-education/education-for-when-a-hockey-career-gets-put-on-ice/article1857046/?service=mobile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education can often be overlooked by professional athletes, once they have made it to their desired sports league. This is a major concern because many professional athletes have no funds or career options to fall back on.&lt;ref name="Caryna"&gt;{{cite web|last=Caryna|first=John|title=Why a college degree is important for professional athletes|publisher=Helium|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without a college degree, higher education, or in some instances even a high school diploma; there are limited options to explore in the world outside of athletics.&lt;ref name="Caryna"/&gt; Well established athletes like Shaquille O'Neal and Ray Lewis have gone back to receive their college degrees, despite their incredible success in their respected athletic professions.&lt;ref name="Caryna"/&gt; One side of the argument says that college athletics and the educational institutions often do not succeed in accommodating their student athletes for their future endeavors outside of sports, and that the overall relationship between schools and athletes can be perceived as commercial, rather than educational.&lt;ref name="McCormick"&gt;{{cite web|last=McCormick|first=A. C|title=The myth of the student-athlete: The college athlete as employee|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/213127627?accountid=11091|publisher=Washington Law Review|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In college athletics, such as basketball and football, coaches appear to control athletes in and out of season of their respected sport.&lt;ref name="McCormick"/&gt;  With incredibly demanding schedules that almost always requires players to miss classes to focus on their athletic performance, one side of the argument is that it can be difficult to state that schools implement policies and coaches that respect athletics and education equally at a university.&lt;ref name="McCormick"/&gt;  Universities have been able to counter these arguments by complying with NCAA rules on limits of practice time and extracurricular activities for the sport that do not pertain to the classroom.&lt;ref name="Caudill"&gt;{{cite web|last=Caudill|first=Steven|title=The Impact of Participation in Intercollegiate Athletics on Income and Graduation|jstor=2109580|publisher=The MIT Press|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Universities often argue that not only do these athletes receive an opportunity of a higher education that they might not have necessarily been able to receive, but that these skills enhance competitive drive, discipline, and teamwork skills in future work settings.&lt;ref name="Caudill"/&gt;  Scholarships often provide opportunities for those who may not have gotten into a university, based on previous academic performance or financial status, have been the one of the central arguments for universities justifying their athletic standing and policies.&lt;ref name="Caudill"/&gt; Additional arguments now cite the importance of the synergies in the valuable knowledge and experience gained on the field and how these skills are applied in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Caudill"/&gt;  In a study done about the mean attribution of life skills to the sport experience, 75% of former athletes who were participants stated that there were major life skills associated with sports that transferred to their working lives.&lt;ref name="Barton"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barton|first=Gavin|title=Career success and life skill development through sports|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/880398589?accountid=11091|publisher=Boston University|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study analyzed different types of experiential learning, and found that these were often experiential skills that were learned through playing sports that included what ranged from leadership to goal setting.&lt;ref name="Barton"/&gt;  These arguments may more commonly come up to defend universities for implementing high standards in athletic performance.&lt;ref name="Caudill"/&gt;   Regardless of these allegations against universities, education is extremely valuable to professional athletes because the average athlete rarely has a long tenure and cannot make their income last for a sustained period of time.&lt;ref name="Caryna"/&gt;

Some believe that the universities are not to blame, and that students often pave their own path.  In a survey consisting of previous student athletes, athletic performance and effort was attributed to helping the development of major life skills, especially in the work force.&lt;ref name="Barton"/&gt;  However, this can change from person to person, and social theorists even believe that roles and identities contribute heavily to where a person is headed in life.&lt;ref name="Preacco"&gt;{{cite web|last=Preacco|first=Lara|title=Student-athlete worldview: A qualitative discovery of student-athletes outlook of the world through their athletic experiences|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305037662?accountid=|publisher=Western Michigan University|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some athletes, whose personality caters to working incredibly hard on the field, rather than off the field, thus developing more of an athletic identity that can get in the way of a career path or education.&lt;ref name="Preacco"/&gt;  The same goes with those who have passions in education or some other activity, making student athletes think very differently from one another.&lt;ref name="Preacco"/&gt;

==Successes==

===Basketball===
[[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Basketball Hall of Famer]] Magic Johnson is an example of an athlete who has not only kept his money, but increased it. He has built a thriving business empire.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; He was at one time a part owner of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], and his company, Magic Johnson Enterprises, has a net worth of $700 million. In 2012, he was a minority partner in [[Guggenheim Partners|a group]] that bought the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].

Michael Jordan has proven almost as successful in his post-basketball business ventures, despite a temporary financial setback due to his divorce. He has numerous business interests, most notably his own line of apparel through [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. In March 2010, he became the majority owner of the Charlotte Bobcats, now known as the [[Charlotte Hornets]], after buying out most of the interest of founding owner [[Robert L. Johnson|Bob Johnson]] for $275 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4989536 |title=Jordan soon to get reins of Bobcats |author=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=March 13, 2010 |accessdate=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Hall of Famer, [[Dave Bing]], established a steel processing company, Bing Steel, in [[Detroit]] in 1980. After Bing Steel suffered a loss in its first year of operation, Bing decided to shift his company from manufacturing to being a middleman. Bing Steel became profitable in its second year of operation, and has since expanded to become the Bing Group, a conglomerate involved in a number of businesses, including supplying the automotive industry.  However, it has been recently announced that the Bing Group is heavily in debt and is in process of being sold.  Most of his holdings have either gone bankrupt or been dissolved.

Still another Hall of Famer, [[Karl Malone]], was involved in a substantial number of business ventures during his NBA career, with his involvement both expanding and diversifying since his retirement. A 2012 story in the ''[[Deseret News]]'' of [[Salt Lake City]], where he played almost all of his NBA career, listed his current ventures. Among these are new-car and used-car dealerships in the Salt Lake City area; a cattle ranch and substantial timber property in his home state of [[Louisiana]]; restaurants in Louisiana, Utah and [[Idaho]]; a commercial development company; a deer-raising venture; and an outfitting business.&lt;ref name=Malone/&gt;

===Baseball===
[[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] pitcher [[Nolan Ryan]] has proven successful in business, though not at the level of Johnson or Jordan. After the end of his playing career in 1993, he was majority owner and chairman of a bank in his home town of [[Alvin, Texas]] before selling his interest in 2005. He also became part owner of two [[Minor league baseball|minor-league]] teams in his home state, the [[Corpus Christi Hooks]] and [[Round Rock Express]]. In 2010, he was the public face of, and a minority investor in, a group that bought the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], the team with which he finished his [[Major League Baseball]] playing career. He owned a controlling interest in the team until late 2013, when he sold his stake after differences with the majority partners of the Rangers.

===Football===
Former [[Washington Redskins]] cornerback [[Eugene Profit]] parlayed his [[Yale University|Yale]] economics education into a highly successful financial career. His company, Profit Investment Management, looks after $2 billion in assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/damon_hack/06/16/eugene.profit/index.html?xid=cnnbin&amp;hpt=hp_bn10 |title=Playing for Profit: Ex-NFL corner succeeds in business after football |author=Damon Hack |publisher=''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' |date=June 16, 2011 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Denver Broncos]] quarterback and Pro Football Hall of Fame member [[John Elway]] used his football earnings to launch a chain of automotive dealerships and steakhouses.&lt;ref name="empire"&gt;espn.com, [http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=nfl&amp;id=2744058 Elway expands business empire, opening new steakhouse]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mixed results==
Another athlete turned successful businessman, at least for a time, was former football safety [[Dave Duerson]], president and CEO of Duerson Foods L.L.C.&lt;ref name=BE/&gt; However, an expansion of his company turned into financial disaster due to issues with a supplier of freezers for a meat processing plant. Duerson Foods won a $34 million judgment against the freezer company in 2004, but never collected because the company later filed for bankruptcy, and Duerson himself filed for bankruptcy in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/nfl/news/story?id=6146920 |title=Duerson filed for bankruptcy |work=[[ESPN.com|ESPNChicago.com]] |date=February 22, 2011 |accessdate=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duerson's story turned far more tragic, as he committed suicide in February 2011, and a post-mortem examination of his brain revealed he was suffering from what was described as a "moderately advanced" case of [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]], presumably from constant blows to the head during his football career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/nfl/news/story?id=6465271 |title=Dave Duerson had brain damage |work=[[ESPN.com|ESPNChicago.com]] |date=May 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failures==

[[Vince Young]] – After earning $45 million in salary and endorsements, Young is one of the most recent pro athletes to go broke.

[[Antoine Walker]] – Despite earning $108 million in salary while playing in the NBA, Walker had to declare bankruptcy in 2010 listing assets of $5 million and debts of $13 million thanks to bad real estate investments and gambling debts.

[[Evander Holyfield]] – After earning $250 million as a heavyweight champion, in 2008 a bank foreclosed on Holyfield's $10 million, 54,000 square foot, 109 room Atlanta mansion.

[[Kenny Anderson (basketball)|Kenny Anderson]] – Despite earning $63 million in salary, Anderson was broke the day he left the NBA. After filing for bankruptcy, Anderson became a K-12 school teacher.

[[Warren Sapp]] – In April 2012, Sapp filed for bankruptcy claiming assets worth $6.5 million and debts of $7 million. The $7 million is owed to the IRS, [[child support]] to four different women, and medical bills.

[[Allen Iverson]] – In February 2012, Iverson told a Georgia judge that he was flat broke and could not pay an $860k jewelry debt. Iverson earned $154 million in salary and $30–50 million in endorsements during his career. Iverson was known to travel with a 50-person entourage, lost millions of dollars gambling, lavished friends with expensive gifts and had massive monthly child support obligations.

[[Mike Tyson]] - earned an estimated $400 million over his career, but declared bankruptcy in 2003.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/11/25/unitas-borg-money-biz-sports-cx_af_1125athletefinances.html |title=Sports Stars' Money Meltdowns |author=Andrew Farrell |publisher=Forbes |date=November 25, 2008 |accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sheryl Swoopes]] earned an estimated $50 million playing basketball, and declared bankruptcy in 2004, owing $711,050.&lt;ref name=Swoops&gt;{{cite news |title=Swoopes Says She Is Gay, and Exhales  |author=Liz Robbins |newspaper=New York Times |date=October 27, 2005 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/27/sports/basketball/27swoopes.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swoopes admitted, "I didn't surround myself with the right people. I got in a position where it was like, 'Oh, wow, what happened?'"&lt;ref name=Swoops/&gt;

Former [[Boston Red Sox]] star [[Jack Clark (baseball)|Jack Clark]] filed for bankruptcy in the middle of his $8.7-million-dollar contract.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The '''Philippine Sports Hall of Fame''' ('''PSHOF'''') is a [[hall of fame]] established in 1999 to honor Filipino athletes, trainers, and coaches with the first batch of inductees included in the hall of fame in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lydia, Paeng, Bong Coo inducted to Hall of Fame |url=http://www.journal.com.ph/sports/other-sports/lydia-paeng-bong-coo-inducted-hall-fame |accessdate=24 November 2018 |work=Journal Online |date=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ports Authority Football Club''' is a [[Sierra Leone]]an professional [[Association football|football]] club based in the capital [[Freetown]]. The club is a member of the [[Sierra Leone National Premier League]], which is the top football division in Sierra Leone. The club is owned and run by the Sierra Leone Ports Authority (SLPA). Ports Authority play their home games at the [[National Stadium (Sierra Leone)|National Stadium]] in Freetown.

One of the biggest and most popular football clubs in Sierra Leone, they won the Sierra Leone National Premier League championship in 1973 and again in 2008. They have won the Sierra Leonean FA Cup competition on two consecutive times in 1990 and 1991. Ports Authority have an intense [[sports rivalry|rivalry]] with [[East End Lions]] as both clubs come from the east end of Freetown.  In 1996, Ports Authority became the first and only Sierra Leonean football club to reach the quarter-final of [[CAF Confederation Cup]].

Ports Authority Football team executives fired three from their technical team on 07/05/2010 after an executive meeting.  The three fired were the technical director of the team, [[Akie Noah]], head coach Abu Bakarr Kamara and one of his assistants, Mohamed Kamara (Ahmed Central).
According to the chairman of the media team of the club, Musa Sesay, he said the three were asked to quit the club with immediate effect.

For the moment, the team will be coached by Hassan Milla, a former player of the team and supervised by Harold Nat Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://awoko.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=8387&amp;cntnt01returnid=24]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Serve and volley''' is a style of play in [[tennis]] where the player serving moves quickly towards the net after hitting a [[serve (tennis)|serve]]. The server then attempts to hit a [[volley (tennis)|volley]] (a shot where the ball is struck without allowing it to bounce), as opposed to the baseline style, where the server stays back following the serve and attempts to hit a [[groundstroke]] (a shot where the ball is allowed to bounce before contact is made). The serve and volley style of play has diminished in recent years with advances in racquet and string technologies which allow players to generate a great amount of top spin on groundstrokes and [[passing shot]]s. The slowing of court surfaces and deflation of balls, promoting longer rallies for the enjoyment of spectators, has also put a damper on the serve and volley style. Some also claim that a lack of teaching of the serve and volley to juniors, who are too small to effectively employ this method, has caused it to become obsolete in grassroots tennis.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The aim of this strategy is to put immediate pressure on the opponent with the intent of ending points quickly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.patcash.co.uk/2018/03/the-6-basic-strokes-in-tennis-explained/|title=Tennis 101: The 6 Basic Strokes Explained Step-by-Step {{!}} Pat Cash Tennis|date=2018-03-01|work=Pat Cash Tennis|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Good returns must be made, or else the server can gain the advantage. This tactic is especially useful on fast [[Tennis court|courts]] (e.g. grass courts) and less so on slow courts (e.g. clay courts). For it to be successful, the player must either have a good serve to expose an opponent's poor return or be exceptionally quick and confident in movement around the net to produce an effective returning volley. [[Ken Rosewall]], for instance, had a very feeble serve but was a very successful serve-and-volley player for two decades. [[Goran Ivanišević]], on the other hand, had success employing the serve-and-volley strategy with great serves and average volleys.

==The Serve and volley era==
Serve-and-volley is thought to have been invented by the Australian [[Norman Brookes]]. Although earlier tennis greats such as [[Bill Tilden]], [[Ellsworth Vines]], and [[Don Budge]] had been noted for their fine serves and net games, they had not played a 100% serve-and-volley style game. [[Jack Kramer]] in the late 1940s was the first world-class player to consistently come to the net after every serve, including his second serve. Kramer writes, however, in his 1979 autobiography, that it was [[Bobby Riggs]], his opponent in the 1948 Pro tennis tour who began the strategy: "When we first started touring he came at me on his first serve, on his second serve, and on my second serve.... my second serve didn't kick like Bobby's, so he could return that deep enough and follow into the net.... It forced me to think attack constantly. I would rush in and try to pound his weakest point -- his backhand. So the style I am famous for was not consciously planned: it was created out of the necessity of dealing with Bobby Riggs."

In the mid-1950s, when [[Pancho Gonzales]] was dominating professional tennis with his serve-and-volley game, occasional brief attempts were made to partially negate the power of his serve. This, it was felt, would lead to longer rallies and more spectator interest. At least three times the rules were modified:

* In several important tournaments such as the [[United States Professional Championship]]s the Van Alen Streamlined Scoring System (VASSS), devised by [[Jimmy Van Alen|James Van Alen]], was used. The match was scored as if in [[table tennis]], with 21 points per game, 5 serves per player, and no second serves. The fans preferred the traditional scoring system, however, and in any case Gonzales continued to win under VASSS rules.
* Jack Kramer, by then the professional tour promoter and no longer its dominant player, also tried a three-bounce rule, in which the server could not come to the net until the ball had been in play for at least three bounces. Gonzales won anyway, and this experiment was dropped.
* Kramer also tried marking a secondary service line one yard behind the baseline, so that the server was further away from the net when he served. Once again Gonzales was undeterred and the original rules were restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kramer|first1=Jack|title=The Game|date=1981|publisher=André Deutsch|location=London|isbn=0233973079|page=244|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other male tennis players known for their serve-and-volley technique include [[Pancho Segura]], [[Frank Sedgman]], [[Lew Hoad]], [[Rod Laver]], [[Roy Emerson]], [[John McEnroe]], [[Stefan Edberg]], [[Pat Cash]], [[Boris Becker]], [[Patrick Rafter]], [[Pete Sampras]] and [[Tim Henman]]. Sampras, despite being known for his great serve and volley game, did not always come to the net behind the serve on slower courts, particularly on the second serve. This was especially the case when he was younger.

The serve-and-volley strategy has traditionally been less common amongst female players. An early pioneer in women's volleying was [[Elizabeth Ryan]], who was at the top of the women's game in the mid-to-late 1920s. But it was later on that serve and volley caught on in women's game. The style propelled [[Margaret Court]] to become the all-time leader in Grand Slam titles (24 in singles, 62 total). [[Martina Navratilova]] and [[Jana Novotná]] later became players well known for their serve-and-volley style. More recently, players such as [[Martina Hingis]], [[Justine Henin]], and [[Amélie Mauresmo]] were willing to come to the net, with Henin and Mauresmo playing a very heavy serve and volley style and volleying in general match during the 2006 Wimbledon Finals. Later in her career Henin was also known for serving and volleying on set and match points, such as on Championship point at the 2007 US Open Final against [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]].

==Serve and volley today==
Although the strategy has become less common in both the men's and women's game, a few players still prefer to come in on their serves. It is also commonly used as a surprise tactic. Notable examples are [[Roger Federer]], [[Feliciano López]], [[Nicolas Mahut]], [[Rajeev Ram]], [[Gilles Müller]], [[Radek Štěpánek]], [[Ivo Karlović]], [[Dustin Brown (tennis)|Dustin Brown]], [[Pierre-Hugues Herbert]], [[Sergiy Stakhovsky]], [[Sam Groth]], [[Łukasz Kubot]], [[Leander Paes]], and [[Mischa Zverev]]. The frequent use of serve-and-volley strategy enabled Zverev to upset 3-time Grand Slam champion [[Andy Murray]] at the [[2017 Australian Open]].

On the women's side, serve-and-volley has become almost extinct at the very top level. [[Roberta Vinci]] and [[Hsieh Su-wei]] are the only notable (WTA elite) players that prefer to play with this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Italian Renaissance: Errani/Vinci US Open Champs|url=http://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/match_reports/2012-09-09/201209091347217789115.html|publisher=USOpen.org|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on the serve and volley==
[[Bill Tilden]], the dominant player of the 1920s and one of the fathers of the ''cannonball'' serve, nevertheless preferred to play from the backcourt and liked nothing better than to face an opponent who threw powerful serves and groundstrokes at him and who rushed the net — one way or another Tilden would find a way to hit the ball past him. Tilden may also have spent more time analyzing the game of tennis than anyone before or since.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} His book ''Match Play and the Spin of the Ball'' (1925) is still in print and is the definitive work on the subject.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} In it, Tilden states that a perfect baseline player will always beat a perfect serve-and-volleyer 6-0 because his returns of service will be winning passing shots; however he also states that of course neither such a player can exist. Tilden used this style of play for many years.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Some of the most interesting matches of all time according to Pat Cash&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Tennis-In-Mens-singles-whose-rivalry-has-been-most-interesting/answer/Pat-Cash|title=Pat Cash's answer to Tennis: In Men's singles whose rivalry has been most interesting? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; have pitted great baseliners such as [[Björn Borg]] or [[Andre Agassi]] against great serve-and-volleyers such as [[Stefan Edberg]], [[John McEnroe]] or [[Pat Rafter]]. Since Tilden's time, head-to-head results on various surfaces, such as those played out in the famous rivalry between [[Borg–McEnroe rivalry|Borg and McEnroe]], contradict his theory that great baseline players will tend to defeat great serve-and-volley ones.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/wins-mcenroe,0,3091040.photo&lt;/ref&gt;

Another perspective on the serve-and-volley game is that it is less tiring than playing constantly from the backcourt. Kramer says in his autobiography that he and [[Pancho Segura]] once tried playing three matches in which they allowed the ball to bounce three times before either could approach the net. "I don't believe I could have played tennis the way Segoo and I did for the three nights because it wore me out, running down all those groundstrokes. It was much more gruelling than putting a lot into a serve and following it in." He goes on to say that "[[Ken Rosewall|Rosewall]] was a backcourt player when he came into the pros, but he learned very quickly how to play the net.  Eventually, for that matter, he became a master of it, as much out of physical preservation as for any other reason. I guarantee you that Kenny wouldn't have lasted into his forties as a world-class player if he hadn't learned to serve and volley."

Despite the improvements in racquet technology made towards the end of the twentieth century which made serve-and-volley a rarer tool in a tennis player's skill set, players familiar with the strategy still advocate it. [[Roger Federer]] advocated up-and-coming players not to ignore the tactic's strategy of coming to the net, especially on faster surfaces and as a surprise tactic &lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2017/07/17/roger-federer-questions-people-dont-play-like/&lt;/ref&gt;. Yet other players, such as [[Mischa Zverev]], acknowledged the difficulty of mastering serve-and-volley, recalling his 36-month effort to adopt the style. As he put it: "Every point, you have to be ready. You're either going to get passed, you're going to miss an easy volley or you're going to win the point," and likened it to the [[Stochastic process|stochastic]] nature of flipping a coin&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/20971090/it-take-more-roger-federer-embrace-serve-volley-tennis-make-comeback&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Shane Paul Howarth''' (born 8 July 1968) is a former international [[rugby union]] player who gained four caps and scored 54 points for the [[All Blacks]] before later switching allegiance to [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]], attaining 19 Welsh caps.

An outside-half or full-back, he was a prolific goal-kicker and a fast elusive runner. He scored 23 points for Wales including a try in the 32–31 win against England in 1999 played at [[Wembley Stadium (1924)|Wembley]] as the [[Millennium Stadium]] was under construction in [[Cardiff]].

==Background==
Howarth was born in [[Auckland]], New Zealand. He was educated at [[St Peter's College, Auckland]].

==Rugby career==
He played for the [[Marist Brothers Old Boys RFC|Auckland Marist club]] and [[Auckland Rugby Football Union|Auckland]]. He made his All Black debut against [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] in 1994 and played in three tests in the series.

In 1996 he switched to [[rugby league]], signing with the [[North Queensland Cowboys]] in the [[Australian Rugby League]] competition. He played twelve games for the club and scored forty nine points, including three field goals.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-17283857.html Howarth likely to stay with Cowboys] '''Sunday Star-Times''', 13 October 1996&lt;/ref&gt; However he was not re-signed by the club and instead returned to rugby union, playing three games for the [[Blues (Super Rugby)|Auckland Blues]] during the 1997 Super 12 season.

He moved to England to play for [[Sale Sharks|Sale]] at outside-half. There was then a tug-of-war between various nations for him to play for them, but he chose Wales, after being offered the chance to play for Newport. Howarth moved to [[Newport RFC]] in 1999 and played for the club until 2003, scoring 1,035 points and helping the Black &amp; Ambers win the WRU Principality Cup.

== Coaching==

Howarth commenced a coaching in Auckland. He was assistant coach of the Pacific Islanders, New Zealand in 2004 and 2005. Howarth was assistant coach for the Auckland NPC team from 2006 until 2010 under Pat Lam. Auckland claimed four championships in 10 years. Howarth's tenure was ended after Auckland slumped to seventh in 2010.[2]

In June 2012 he was appointed as backs coach to [[Wasps RFC|London Wasps]]. From September 2013 until late 2014, Howarth was backs coach for the [[Worcester Warriors]].&lt;ref name="Worcester"&gt;{{cite web| last =All Blacks News| first =| date =27 January 2015| title =Former All Black Howarth leaves Worcester| work =| url =http://www.allblacks.com/News/26594/former-all-black-howarth-leaves-worcester| accessdate = 23 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GrannyGate ==
In 2000 it was discovered that his grandfather was not born in Wales but New Zealand, and he was ineligible to play for Wales. The scandal that followed was termed "grannygate" and Howarth was banned from representing Wales. He retired at the end of 2003. Howarth could have qualified for Wales through residency before he retired but by then the IRB had changed the rules so that players could only represent one country.

It passes over the years to 15,000 seats and is then expanded again on the occasion of the [[1994 African Cup of Nations]] with 6,000 additional seats to reach a capacity of 21,000 seats; A luminous panel is installed at the same time. 
The last expansion was carried out in 1999 to bring the capacity of the stadium to 28,000 seats for the [[2001 Mediterranean Games]], a reorganization of the gallery of honor was carried out, from a capacity of 70 to 217 places. The stadium has yet to be expanded to reach the capacity of 49,000 seats after the announcement the president of the club [[:fr:Moez Driss|Moez Driss]] in May 2008.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Please do not alter plot summary without Talk page consensus. Plot summary should be between 400-700 words as per [[WP:FILMPLOT]]. --&gt;
In the [[San Fernando Valley]] during the summer of 1962, Scotty Smalls is the new boy in the neighborhood, seeking desperately to fit in. He would be welcomed on the local sandlot baseball team that practices every day, which only has eight players. His mother encouraged to make friends this summer. Smalls, however, cannot play baseball; on his first visit to the sandlot he finds himself in the outfield with a [[Batted ball|fly ball]] descending toward him which bounces off his glove, causing the other boys, except Benny "the Jet" Rodriguez, the team's leader, to burst out laughing. Smalls, humiliated, leaves the baseball field.

Smalls asks his stepfather to teach him to play, and while his stepdad agrees, Scott cannot successfully catch or throw the ball. Benny soon teaches him what he needs to know, and with Benny's support, he gets a place on the team.

Meanwhile, behind a wall at the end of the sandlot is a backyard inhabited by "the Beast", an [[English Mastiff]] so large and savage that it has become a neighborhood legend. One day, the boys' last ball lands in the Beast's backyard. Smalls attempts to retrieve it, but the others, knowing about the Beast, stop him. That evening, they tell him all about the Beast, and that his owner, Mr. Mertle, got him when he was just a puppy when thieves were plaguing his junkyard, Mertle's Acres. After a couple of weeks, the puppy became the Beast; he grew enormous and aggressive, killing and devouring the thieves, bones and all. Eventually, Squints' grandfather, who was the police chief at the time, had Mr. Mertle chain up the Beast in the backyard and keep him under his house forever. Smalls also learns that many baseballs end up in the backyard, and then they just disappear.

The next day, at a local swimming pool, Squints pretends to drown so that he can kiss the lifeguard, Wendy Peffercorn, whom he has a crush on. She does not take too kindly to it, and they are banned from the pool. Nonetheless, she realizes that Squints has feelings for her.

One day, Benny busts the guts out of their baseball and Smalls steals his stepfather's ball. After that ball also ends up with the Beast, Smalls discovers the ball was special; it was signed by [[Babe Ruth]]. Smalls' stepfather has gone to Chicago for a week-long business trip, putting Smalls and the others on a race against time to recover the ball before he returns. They make many attempts to retrieve the ball, but the Beast thwarts each attempt. One night, Benny has a dream in which Babe Ruth gives him advice, and Benny explains to him about the Beast, saying that he ate one kid who hopped the fence and went into Mr. Mertle's backyard.

The next day, Benny puts on [[PF Flyers]], shoes "guaranteed" to make a kid run faster and jump higher, and goes into Mr. Mertle's backyard, despite protests from his team. Benny retrieves the ball, but the Beast breaks his chain and escapes, chasing Benny through the streets, a theater, a picnic, the local swimming pool and eventually back to the sandlot. Mr. Mertle's fence falls on top of the Beast, but Smalls and Benny manage to get the fence off him; he shows the kids that he has been keeping all the baseballs they hit into the backyard in a small hole. Smalls and Benny then meet Mr. Mertle, who reveals that the Beast's real name is Hercules, an [[English Mastiff]], and that he knew Babe Ruth, because he was also a baseball player who went blind after getting hit by a baseball. Mr. Mertle trades the destroyed Babe Ruth-autographed baseball for a baseball signed by all of the [[1927 New York Yankees]], which Smalls gives to his stepfather as a gift to make up for the other ball.

The sandlot boys enjoy the rest of the summer and the next few years, with the Beast as their mascot. Over the next three decades, the boys grow up and go into different careers. Benny and Smalls remain close; Benny becomes a famous [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] player, while Smalls becomes a sportscaster.

== Reception ==
=== Critical ===
''The Sandlot'' has received mixed to positive reviews from critics. The film currently holds a 56% "rotten" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 48 reviews. The site's consensus says "It may be shamelessly derivative and overly nostalgic, but ''The Sandlot'' is nevertheless a genuinely sweet and funny coming-of-age adventure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sandlot/|title=The Sandlot (1993)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars, comparing the movie to a summertime version of ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', based on the tone and narration of both films: {{cquote|There was a moment in the film when Rodriguez hit a line drive directly at the pitcher's mound, and I ducked and held up my mitt, and then I realized I didn't have a mitt, and it was then I also realized how completely this movie had seduced me with its memories of what really matters when you are 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Roger|last=Ebert |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-sandlot-1993|title=The Sandlot (1993)|accessdate=August 15, 2010 |work=RogerEbert.com |publisher=Ebert Digital LLC |date=April 7, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Bob Cannon of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a B+, praising its simplicity and strong fundamentals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bob|last=Cannon|title=The Sandlot (1993) |url=http://ew.com/article/1993/04/23/sandlot/ |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=April 23, 1993|accessdate=October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonard Klady of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a mostly negative review. He praised the cinematography and score, but felt the baseball team did not come together, and that the film, while sincere, was a "remarkably shallow wade, rife with incident and slim on substance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Leonard|last=Klady |url=https://variety.com/1993/film/reviews/the-sandlot-2-1200432087/ |title=The Sandlot|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|date=April 4, 1993|accessdate=October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Box office ===
The film grossed $4 million in its opening weekend and a further $32 million through ticket sales. Figures for worldwide VHS and DVD sales are estimated to be at $76 million. Since its release on both VHS and DVD, the film has become a [[cult favorite]].&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt; 

=== Defamation suit ===
In 1998, Michael Polydoros sued 20th Century Fox and the producers of the film for defamation. Polydoros, a childhood classmate of David Mickey Evans, the author and director of ''The Sandlot'', claimed that the character Michael "Squints" Palledorous was derogatory and caused him shame and humiliation. The trial court found in favor of the filmmakers, and that finding was affirmed by the [[California Court of Appeal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1121596.html |litigants=Polydoros v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3104">The '''Upperville Colt &amp; Horse Show''' is the oldest [[horse show]] in America. Started in 1853 by [[Colonel Richard Henry Dulany]], the show was designed to showcase and improve local breeding stock in Northern [[Virginia]]. Colonel Dulany continued to run the show until his death in 1906. The show has occupied the same scenic spot since its inception 155 years ago; under the shady oak trees of [[Grafton Farm]], near [[Upperville, Virginia]].

==History==
According to historians, Colonel Dulany was riding cross-country one cold winter's day and came across a young [[Colt (horse)|colt]] who was [[Horse casting|cast]] in a low fence. Stopping to free the young horse, he realized the colt had been stuck long enough for his feet to have frozen. Reflecting on the fate of the young horse, Colonel Dulany decided to start a colt &amp; filly show to encourage better care of young horses, and to inspire local breeders to breed better stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.upperville.com/about_history.htm |title=Welcome to Upperville |access-date=2008-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517222844/http://www.upperville.com/about_history.htm |archive-date=2008-05-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was scheduled for June under the oak trees at Grafton Farm, a centrally located Dulany farm on route 50 two miles east of Upperville. The first show listed two classes, one for colts, and one for fillies. Prior to the first show, Colonel Dulany went to Manhattan to consult with silversmith [[Louis Tiffany]] to design a suitable trophy, the labor on which was donated by Mr. Tiffany for the event. The first show proved so popular, a club was formed to run the show. The club, originally called the Upperville Union Club, elected Colonel Dulany as its first president.

==The Show today==
The AA rated show, considered one of the most prestigious in the country, now spans seven days and showcases over two thousand horse and rider combinations. It was named the "Horse Show of the Year" by the National Show Hunter Hall of Fame and the Virginia Horse Show Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Upperville Colt &amp; Horse show |url=http://www.upperville.com/about/ |website=Upperville Colt &amp; Horse Show}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The prize list includes classes in breeding, [[hunters]], and [[jumpers]], and entries range from local children to leading [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Show Jumping World Cup]] horses and riders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upperville.com/index.html Welcome to Upperville]&lt;/ref&gt;

The show attracts over 20,000 spectators and finishes with the popular $100,000 Budweiser Grand Prix on the final Sunday.
