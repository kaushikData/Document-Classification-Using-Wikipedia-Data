'''Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy (ACMECS)''' is a political, economic, and cultural organization among [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Myanmar]].
At the special [[ASEAN Summit]] on SARS, held in Bangkok on 29 April 2003, Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] raised the idea of establishing what was then called the “Economic Cooperation Strategy", with leaders of Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar.

The objectives of this new initiative are to bridge the economic gap among these five countries and to promote prosperity in the sub-region in a sustainable manner. Such prosperity, it is expected, will not only benefit the four countries, but also add value to ASEAN and its solidarity. It is hoped that a stronger Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Thailand will also mean a stronger ASEAN. In this way the new cooperation framework is expected to act as a building block and move ASEAN forward at a more even pace, on the basis of self-reliance and shared prosperity.

Leaders of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Thailand met for the first time on 12 November 2003 in Bagan, the Union of Myanmar. At the Summit, the four Leaders adopted the Bagan Declaration, affirming their commitment to cooperate in five priority areas of cooperation, and endorsed the Economic Cooperation Strategy Plan of Action, under which 46 common projects and 224 bilateral projects were listed for implementation over the next ten years. The Leaders agreed to call this newly created economic cooperation framework the "Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy" or "ACMECS".

The joining of Vietnam with the group on 10 May 2004 has increased ACMECS to 5 member countries. The emphasis of ACMECS is on using self-help and partnership to achieve sustainable development, including [[poverty reduction]], in line with the UN Millennium Development Goals.

ACMECS is intended to act as a catalyst to build upon existing regional cooperation programs and complement bilateral frameworks with a view to transforming the border areas of the five countries into zones of economic growth, social progress and prosperity, and to blending local, national and regional interests for common benefits, shared prosperity, enhanced solidarity, peace, stability and good neighborliness.

'''''A History of Knowledge''''' (1991, {{ISBN|0-345-37316-2}}) is a book on intellectual history, with emphasis on the [[western world|western civilization]], written by [[Charles Van Doren]], a former editor of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. It is a history of human thought covering over 5000 years of philosophy, learning, and belief systems that surveys the key historical trends and breakthroughs connecting the globalizing human landscape of the 20th century all the way back to the scattered roots of human civilization in India, [[Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], China, [[Greece]], and [[Rome]] {{Dubious|date=March 2012}}.

For a sense of the tone, the first section is entitled "The Wisdom of the Ancients" and begins, "By the time [[recorded history|written history]] began, some fifty centuries ago, mankind had learned much more than our primitive ancestors knew."

The book's last chapter focuses on the potential developments of the 21st century. It also contains biographies of many notable historical figures.

The '''Académie française''' ({{IPA-fr|akademi fʁɑ̃sɛːz}}) is the pre-eminent [[France|French]] council for matters pertaining to the [[French language]]. The Académie was officially established in 1635 by [[Cardinal Richelieu]], the chief minister to [[Louis XIII of France|King Louis XIII]].&lt;ref name=aH&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppressed in 1793 during the [[French Revolution]], it was restored as a division of the [[Institut de France]] in 1803 by [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]].&lt;ref name=aH/&gt; It is the oldest of the five ''académies'' of the institute.

The Académie consists of forty members, known informally as ''les immortels'' (the immortals).&lt;ref name=aIM&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; New members are elected by the members of the Académie itself. Academicians hold office for life, but they may resign or be dismissed for misconduct. [[Philippe Pétain]], named [[Marshal of France]] after the victory of [[Verdun]] of [[World War I]], was elected to the Academy in 1931 and, after his governorship of [[Vichy France]] in [[World War II]], was forced to resign his seat in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ted Morgan (writer)|Sanche de Gramont]], ''The French: Portrait of a People'', G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York, 1969, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; The body has the task of acting as an official authority on the language; it is charged with publishing an official dictionary of the language. Its rulings, however, are only advisory, not binding on either the public or the government. {{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==History==
[[Image:Cardinal de Richelieu.jpg|thumb|right|215px|[[Cardinal Richelieu]], responsible for the establishment of the Académie]]

The Académie had its origins in an informal literary group deriving from the [[salon (gathering)|salons]] held at the [[Hôtel de Rambouillet]] during the late 1620s and early 1630s. The group began meeting at [[Valentin Conrart]]'s house, seeking informality. There were then nine members. [[Cardinal Richelieu]], the chief minister of France, made himself protector of the group, and in anticipation of the formal creation of the academy, new members were appointed in 1634. On 22 February 1635, at Richelieu's urging, King Louis XIII granted [[letters patent]] formally establishing the council; according to the letters patent registered at the [[Parlement|Parlement de Paris]] on 10 July 1637,&lt;ref name=aH/&gt; the Académie française was "to labor with all the care and diligence possible, to give exact rules to our language, to render it capable of treating the arts and sciences". The Académie française has remained responsible for the regulation of French grammar, spelling, and literature.

Richelieu's model, the first academy devoted to eliminating the "impurities" of a language, was the [[Accademia della Crusca]], founded in Florence in 1582, which formalized the already dominant position of the [[Tuscan dialect]] of Florence as the model for [[Italian language|Italian]]; the Florentine academy had published its ''Vocabolario'' in 1612.&lt;ref&gt;Einar Ingvald Haugen and Anwar S. Dil, ''The Ecology of Language'', (Stanford University Press) p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], the [[National Convention]] suppressed all royal academies, including the Académie française. In 1792, the election of new members to replace those who died was prohibited; in 1793, the academies were themselves abolished. They were all replaced in 1795 by a single body called the [[Institut de France]], or Institute of France. [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], as [[First Consul]], decided to restore the former academies, but only as "classes" or divisions of the Institut de France. The second class of the Institut was responsible for the French language, and corresponded to the former Académie française. When [[Louis XVIII of France|King Louis XVIII]] came to the throne in 1816, each class regained the title of "Académie"; accordingly, the second class of the Institut became the Académie française. Since 1816, the existence of the Académie française has been uninterrupted.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The [[President of France]] is the "protector" or patron of the Académie. Cardinal Richelieu originally adopted this role; upon his death in 1642, [[Pierre Séguier]], the [[Chancellor of France]], succeeded him. [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] adopted the function when Séguier died in 1672; since then, the French head of state has always served as the Académie's protector. From 1672 to 1805, the official meetings of the Académie were in the [[Louvre]]; since 1805, the Académie française has met in the [[Collège des Quatre-Nations]] (known now as the Palais de l'Institut). The remaining academies of the Institut de France also meet in the Palais de l'Institut.

==Membership==
The Académie française has forty seats, each of which is assigned a separate number. Candidates make their applications for a specific seat, not to the Académie in general: if several seats are vacant, a candidate may apply separately for each. Since a newly elected member is required to eulogize his or her predecessor in the installation ceremony, it is not uncommon that potential candidates refuse to apply for particular seats because they dislike the predecessors.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Members are known as ''les Immortels'' (the Immortals) because of the [[motto]], ''À l'immortalité'' ("To Immortality"), that is on the official seal of the charter granted by Cardinal Richelieu.&lt;ref name=aIM/&gt;

One of the ''Immortels'' is chosen by his or her colleagues to be the Académie's Perpetual Secretary. The Secretary is called "Perpetual" because the holder serves for life, although he or she may resign, and may thereafter be styled as Honorary Perpetual Secretary; indeed the three post-[[World War II]] Perpetual Secretaries resigned due to old age. The Perpetual Secretary acts as a chairperson and chief representative of the Académie. The two other officers, a Director and a Chancellor, are elected for three-month terms. The most senior member, by date of election, is the Dean of the Académie.

New members are elected by the Académie itself. (The original members were appointed.) When a seat becomes vacant, a person may apply to the Secretary if she or he wishes to become a candidate. Alternatively, existing members may nominate other candidates. A candidate is elected by a majority of votes from voting members. A [[quorum]] is twenty members. If no candidate receives an absolute majority, another election must be performed at a later date. The election is valid only if the protector of the Académie, the President of France, grants his approval. The President's approbation, however, is only a formality. (There was a controversy about the candidacy of [[Paul Morand]], whom [[Charles de Gaulle]] opposed in 1958. Morand was finally elected ten years later, and he was received without the customary visit, at the time of investiture, to the Palace [[Élysée]].)

[[Image:Poincare larger.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Raymond Poincaré]] was one of the five French heads of state who became members of the Académie française. He is depicted wearing the ''habit vert'', or green habit, of the Académie.]]

The new member is then installed at a meeting of the Académie. The new member must deliver a speech to the Académie, which includes a [[eulogy]] for the member being replaced. This is followed by a speech made by one of the members. Eight days thereafter, a public reception is held, during which the new member makes a speech thanking his or her colleagues for their election. Once, a member ([[Georges de Porto-Riche]]) was not accorded a reception because the eulogy he made of his predecessor was not considered satisfactory, and he refused to rewrite it. [[Georges Clemenceau]] refused to be received because he feared that he might be received by his enemy, [[Raymond Poincaré]].

Members remain in the Académie for life. However, the council may dismiss an academician for grave misconduct. The first dismissal occurred in 1638, when [[Auger de Moléon de Granier]] was expelled for theft. The most recent dismissals occurred at the end of [[World War II]]: [[Philippe Pétain]], [[Abel Bonnard]], [[Abel Hermant]], and [[Charles Maurras]] were all excluded for their association with the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]]. In total, twenty members have been expelled from the Académie.

There have been a total of 732 ''immortels'',&lt;ref name=aIM/&gt; of whom nine have been women (the first woman, [[Marguerite Yourcenar]], was elected in 1980 – besides the nine elected women, 25 women were candidates, the first one in 1874). Individuals who are not citizens of France may be, and have been, elected. Moreover, although most academicians are writers, one need not be a member of the literary profession to become a member. The Académie has included numerous politicians, lawyers, scientists, historians, philosophers, and senior [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] clergymen. Five French heads of state have been members ([[Adolphe Thiers]], [[Raymond Poincaré]], [[Paul Deschanel]], [[Philippe Pétain]], and [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]]) and one foreign head of state (the poet [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]] of [[Senegal]], who was also the first African elected, in 1983).&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Message from Mister Leopold Sedar Senghor, President of the Republic, to the Senegalese People|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2538|publisher=World Digital Library|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous members include [[Voltaire]];  [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Charles, baron de Montesquieu]]; [[Victor Hugo]]; [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]]; [[Émile Littré]]; [[Louis Pasteur]]; [[Louis de Broglie]]; and [[Henri Poincaré]].

Many notable French writers have not become members of the Académie française. During 1855, the writer [[Arsène Houssaye]] devised the expression "forty-first seat" for deserving individuals who were never elected to the Académie, either because their candidacies were rejected, because they were never candidates, or because they died before appropriate vacancies arose. Notable French authors who never became academicians include [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Joseph de Maistre]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[René Descartes]], [[Denis Diderot]], [[Romain Rolland]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Molière]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Jules Verne]], [[Théophile Gautier]], and [[Émile Zola]].

===Uniform===
The official uniform of a member is known as ''l'habit vert'', or green clothing.&lt;ref name=uniform&gt;{{cite news
| publisher = Académie Française official website
| url = http://www.academie-francaise.fr/les-immortels/lhabit-vert-et-lepee
| title = L'habit vert et l'épée 
| accessdate = 2018-06-14
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''habit vert'', worn at the Académie's formal ceremonies, was first adopted during Napoleon Bonaparte's reorganization of the Institut de France. It consists of a long black coat and black-feathered [[bicorne]],&lt;ref name=uniform/&gt; both richly embroidered with green leafy motifs, together with black trousers or skirt. Further, members other than [[clergy]] receive a [[ceremonial sword]] (''l'épée'').&lt;ref name=uniform/&gt;

==Role as authority on the French language==
[[File:DictionaryFrenchAcademy1835.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Title page of the 6th edition of the Académie's [[dictionary]] (1835)]]
The Académie is France's official authority on the usages, vocabulary, and grammar of the French language.

===Dictionary===
The Académie publishes a dictionary of the French language, known as the ''[[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française]]'', which is regarded as official in France. A special commission composed of several (but not all) of the members of the Académie compiles the work.&lt;ref name=aH/&gt;

The Académie has published thirteen editions of the dictionary, of which three were preliminary, eight were complete, and two were supplements for specialised words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classiques-garnier.com/numerique-en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=64%3Adictionaries-of-the-french-academy-17th-20th-c&amp;catid=33%3Acatalogue-bases-dicenc&amp;Itemid=30 Classiques Garnier numérique] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725082101/http://www.classiques-garnier.com/numerique-en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=64:dictionaries-of-the-french-academy-17th-20th-c&amp;catid=33:catalogue-bases-dicenc&amp;Itemid=30 |date=2014-07-25 }}, ''Corpus of Dictionaries of the French Academy (from the 17th to the 20th Century)'', Retrieved 2011-03-17&lt;/ref&gt; These are:

;Preliminary editions:
* ''Le Dictionnaire de l'Académie française'' (from ''A'' to ''Aversion''), pre-edition, [[Frankfurt am Main]], 1687
* ''Le Dictionnaire de l'Académie française'' (from ''A'' to ''Confiture''), pre-edition, Frankfurt am Main, 1687

;Complete editions:
* ''Le Dictionnaire de l'Académie française dedié au Roy'' ("1st edition"), Paris, 1694
* ''Nouveau Dictionnaire de l'Académie française dedié au Roy'' ("2nd edition"), Paris, 1718
* ''Le Dictionnaire de l'Académie française'' ("3rd edition"), Paris, 1740
* ''Le Dictionnaire de l'Académie française'' ("4th edition"), Paris, 1762

;Supplementary editions for the sciences, arts, and technology:
* Corneille, Thomas, ''Le Dictionnaire des Arts et des Sciences'', Paris, 1694
* Barré, Louis, ''Complément du Dictionnaire de l'Académie française'', Paris, 1842

The Académie is continuing work on the ninth edition, of which the first volume (''A'' to ''Enzyme'') appeared in 1992,&lt;ref name=aH/&gt; ''Éocène'' to ''Mappemonde'' was published in 2000, and ''Maquereau'' to ''Quotité'' in 2011. In 1778, the Académie attempted to compile a "historical dictionary" of the French language; this idea, however, was later abandoned, the work never progressing past the letter&amp;nbsp;''A''.

===Anglicisms===

As the use of [[English language|English]] terms by media increased over the years, the Académie has tried to prevent the [[Anglicization]] of the French language. For example, the Académie has recommended to avoid [[loanword]]s from modern English (such as ''walkman'', ''computer'',  ''software'' and ''e-mail''), in favour of neologisms, i.e. newly coined French words derived from existing ones (''{{wiktfr|baladeur}}'', ''{{wiktfr|ordinateur}}'', ''{{wiktfr|logiciel}}'', and ''{{wiktfr|courriel}}'' respectively, the first  three being at present well-established words of the French language).

===Alleged conservatism===

The Academy, despite working on the modernization of the [[French orthography]], has sometimes been criticized{{By whom|date=May 2018}} for allegedly behaving in an overly conservative manner.
A recent controversy involved the officialization of feminine equivalents for the names of several professions. For instance, in 1997, [[Lionel Jospin]]'s government began using the feminine noun "''la ministre''" to refer to a female minister, following the official practice of Canada, Belgium and Switzerland and a frequent, though until then unofficial, practice in France. The Académie, however, insisted in accordance with French grammar rules  on the traditional use of the masculine noun, "''le ministre''", for a minister of either gender. Use of either form remains highly controversial.

==Prizes==
{{See also|Grand prix du roman de l'Académie française|Grand prix de littérature de l'Académie française}}
The Académie française is responsible for awarding several different prizes in various fields (including literature, painting, poetry, theatre, cinema, history, and translation). Almost all of the prizes were created during the twentieth century, and only two prizes were awarded before 1780. In total, the Académie awards more than sixty prizes, most of them annually.

The most important prize is the [[Grand prix de la francophonie]], which was instituted in 1986, and is funded by the governments of France, Canada, Monaco, and Morocco. Other important prizes include the ''[[grand prix de littérature]]'' (for a literary work), the ''grand prix du roman'' (for a novel), the ''grand prix de poésie'' (for poetry), the ''grand prix de philosophie'' (for a philosophical work), the ''grand prix du cinéma'' (for film), and the ''[[grand prix Gobert]]'' (for a work on French history).

==Opposition of regional languages==
The Académie française intervened in June 2008 in French parliamentary debate about regional languages ([[Alsatian language|Alsatian]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and [[Franco-Provençal language|Francoprovençal]]), when it protested against constitutional protection for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/2569651/Frances-LAcadmie-Franaise-upset-by-rule-to-recognise-regional-tongues.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=France's L'Académie française upset by rule to recognise regional tongues | first=Peter | last=Allen | date=16 August 2008 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3886">{{selfref|This is about variables in computer science, for Wikipedia user access levels, see [[Wikipedia:User access levels|User access levels]]}}

In [[computer science]] and [[computer programming]], '''access level''' denotes the set of permissions or restrictions provided to a [[data type]]. Reducing access level is an effective method for limiting [[Failure cause|failure modes]], [[debugging]] time and overall system complexity. It restricts variable modification to only the methods defined within the interface to the class. Thus, it is incorporated into many fundamental [[software design pattern]]s. In general, a given object cannot be created, read, updated or deleted by any function without having a sufficient access level.

The two most common access levels are ''public'' and ''private'', which denote, respectively; permission across the entire program scope, or permission only within the corresponding class. A third, ''protected'', extends permissions to all subclasses of the corresponding class. Access levels modifiers are commonly used in Java &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html|title=Controlling Access to Members of a Class (The Java™ Tutorials &gt;                     Learning the Java Language &gt; Classes and Objects)|website=docs.oracle.com|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as C#, which further provides the ''internal'' level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wxh6fsc7.aspx|title=Access Modifiers (C# Reference)|website=msdn.microsoft.com|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In C++, the only difference between a [[Struct (C programming language)|struct]] and a [[Class (computer science)|class]] is the default access level, which is ''private'' for classes and ''public'' for structs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/inheritance/|title=Friendship and inheritance - C++ Tutorials|website=www.cplusplus.com|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To illustrate the benefit: consider a public variable which can be accessed from any part of a program. If an error occurs, the culprit could be within any portion of the program, including various sub-dependencies. In a large code base, this leads to thousands of potential sources. Alternatively, consider a private variable. Due to access restrictions, all modifications to its value must occur via functions defined within the class. Therefore, the error is structurally contained within the class. There is often only a single source file for each class, which means debugging only requires evaluation of a single file. With sufficient [[Modularity (programming)|modularity]] and minimal access level, large code bases can avoid many challenges associated with complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/143736/why-do-we-need-private-variables|title=Why do we need private variables?|website=softwareengineering.stackexchange.com|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example: Bank Balance Class ==
Retrieved from Java Coffee Break Q&amp;A &lt;ref&gt;http://www.javacoffeebreak.com/faq/faq0002.html&lt;/ref&gt;
 public class bank_balance
 {
 	public String owner;
 	private int balance; 
 
 	public bank_balance( String name, int dollars )
 	{
 		owner = name;
 
 		if (dollars &gt;= 0)
 			balance = dollars;
 		else
 			dollars =0;
 	}
 
 	public int getBalance()
 	{
 		return balance;
 	}
 
 	public void setBalance(int dollars)
 	{
 		if (dollars &gt;= 0)
 			balance = dollars;
 		else
 			dollars = 0;		
 	}
 }
Here, the imperative variable ''balance'' is defined as a ''private int''. This ensures other classes, methods and functions cannot accidentally overwrite the variable balance. Instead, they must access the interface for the class ''bank_balance'', whose methods ensure the balance cannot drop below 0.

'''Al-Qaeda in Bosnia and Herzegovina''' is the [[al-Qaeda]] branch based in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], formed during the [[Bosnian War]] in 1992. During the Bosnian War, the group contributed volunteers to the [[Bosnian mujahideen]] (called ''El Mudžahid''), a volunteer detachment of the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The group operated through the [[Saudi High Commission for Relief of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (SHC), and after the war carried out the [[Mostar car bombing]] in 1997. The operations in Bosnia occurred following the [[Soviet–Afghan War]].&lt;ref name="Atwan"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Abdel Bari|last=Atwan|year=2012|title=The Secret History of al Qaeda|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=EDshBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP155&amp;hl=no&amp;pg=PT155#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Saqi|page=155|isbn=9780863568435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Frank|last=Clements|year=2003|title=Conflict in Afghanistan: A Historical Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=bv4hzxpo424C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=no&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=153|isbn=9781851094028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Steven|last=Woehrel|year=2007|chapter=Islamic Terrorism and the Balkans|chapter-url=https://books.google.no/books?id=HHFHe7Rf0JsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=no&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|editor-first=Cofie D.|editor-last=Malbouisson|title=Focus on Islamic Issues|publisher=Nova Publishers|page=75|isbn=9781600212048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Michael|last=Freeman|year=2016|title=Financing Terrorism: Case Studies|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=ZvkFDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=no&amp;pg=PA186#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Routledge|page=186|isbn=9781317135074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Bosnian War===
 {{see also|Bosnian mujahideen}}
During the Bosnian War, al-Qaeda contributed to the radicalisation of European Muslims. Al-Qaeda's operations in Bosnia were led by [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="Atwan"/&gt; Al-Qaeda-leader [[Osama bin Laden]], is thought to have visited camps in the country between 1994 and 1996.&lt;ref name="Atwan"/&gt; Volunteer mujahideen arrived from all around the world, including [[France]], [[Indonesia]], [[Iraq]], [[Malaysia]], [[Morocco]], [[Russia]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Spain]], [[Thailand]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]] and [[Yemen]].{{sfn|Lebl|2014|p=8}}

During the Bosnian War, a British worker Paul Goodall was killed in Bosnia and Herzegovina with several bullets to the head. An employer of the SHC, [[Abdul Hadi al-Gatani]] was arrested for murder, after which he admitted that the gun he used in the killing was his. Two Yemenis, namely Abu Ends and Abu Hulud, were also arrested. Both the Bosnian and Saudi governments didn't have any interest in investigating his and SHC's activities. The [[Party of Democratic Action|SDA]] dissuaded the Bosnian law enforcement from further investigation of SHC. However, Bosnian authorities released him along with the two Yemenis after the El Mujahid Detachment promised that they would be present for hearing on a later date. The three later fled the country. Al-Gatani was later killed fighting along with al-Qaeda and the [[Taliban]] in [[Afghanistan]].{{sfn|Schindler|2007|p=143-144}}

===After the war=== 
After the war, al-Qaeda reestablished its connections in Bosnia and Herzegovina through the SHC charity organization.{{sfn|Jacquard|2002|p=69}} The organization was closely tied and financed by the Saudi government, for which reason an American judge declared it immune after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, concluding that it's a body of the Saudi government. In 2002, the Ministry of Finance of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] conducted a raid in offices of the SHC and found documents that led them to believe that the SHC was "a front of radicals and terrorist related activities".{{sfn|Bur|Collins|2006|p=145}} The same year, an employer of the [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] William Jefferson was killed. One of the suspects was [[Ahmed Zuhair Handala]], linked to the SHC.{{sfn|Schindler|2007|p=263-264}}

In 1996, the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) found out through wiretapping devices that [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|prince Salman]] financed Islamist militants through charity organizations. A report of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] from the same year said that "the CIA has evidence that even high officials of charity organizations and supervisory boards in Saudi Arabia, [[Kuwait]] and [[Pakistan]], such those of the Saudi High Commission, are participating in illicit activities, including support of terrorists."{{CN|date=January 2018}}

Ronald Jacquard claims that majority of the SHC officials supported Osama bin Laden. Even though it participated in legitimate charity, the SHC used its charity character for sending illegal merchandise, drugs and weapons in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In May 1997, a French military report wrote that "the Saudi High Commission, under cover of the humanitarian aid, is helping a development of permanent islamisation of Bosnia and Herzegovina influencing the country's youth. A successful end of this plan would give Islamic fundamentalism a perfect position in Europe and gave cover to members of the Bin Laden's organization".{{sfn|Jacquard|2002|p=67-71}}

A terrorist attack occurred in Mostar in 1997, executed by Handala and his two associates, also linked to the SHC. They managed to escape, but Handala was arrested after the September 11 attacks and detained in the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]].{{sfn|Schindler|2007|p=266}}

In late 2001, a raid was carried out by [[Special Forces (United States Army)|United States Special Forces]] on local SHC headquarters in [[Ilidža]], a suburb of Sarajevo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M6-MDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA163|title=NATO and the Western Balkans: From Neutral Spectator to Proactive Peacemaker|author=Niall Mulchinock|publisher=Springer|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the raid documents, including manuals on how to forge the [[United States Secretary of State]] office ID cards, as well as manuscripts and notes on meetings with Bin Laden were found.{{sfn|Schindler|2007|p=129, 184}} Other al-Qaeda fronts such as Vazir (successor of [[al-Haramain Foundation]]) and the Global Relief Fund were also shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHFHe7Rf0JsC&amp;pg=PA77|title=Focus on Islamic Issues|publisher= Nova Science Publishers|author=Cofie D. Malbouisson|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Bosnian raid on al-Haramain Foundation, an organisation reportedly tied to [[al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya|al-Gama'at Islamiya]] which worked closely with al-Qaeda, uncovered tapes calling for attacks on peacekeepers in Bosnia. The Bosnian police also raided the offices of [[Benevolence International Foundation]] (BIF), finding weapons, military manuals, a fake passport and photos of Bin Laden.&lt;ref name=Routledge&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9qW8LPiY38C&amp;pg=PA84|title=Crime-Terror Alliances and the State: Ethnonationalist and Islamist Challenges to Regional Security|author1=Lyubov Grigorova Mincheva|author2=Ted Robert Gurr|publisher=Routledge|page=84, 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence uncovered by Bosnian authorities on BIF's office on March 19, 2002, led to the arrests of Munib Zahiragic, the head of its Bosnian chapter, and [[Enaam Arnaout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Global War on Terrorism: Assessing the American Response|author=John Davis|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks and terror plots==
In October 2001, Bosnian-Herzegovinan police officers arrested several Bosnian citizens of [[Algeria]]n origin on charges of plotting to fly small aircraft from Visoko and crash them into [[SFOR]] bases in [[Tuzla]] and [[Bratunac]].{{sfn|Lebl|2014|p=9}}

The [[Embassy of the United States, Sarajevo|United States Embassy]] and that of United Kingdom in Sarajevo were closed down in October 2001 under threat of terrorist attacks. The Supreme Court of BiH issued arrest warrants against those suspected of planning bomb attacks on the embassies. Five suspects of North African origins, were arrested including four Algerians with Bosnian citizenship. One of them, [[Bensayah Belkacem]], was identified as a high-ranking Al-Qaeda figure with personal connections to Bin Laden. He was also on the payroll of the Saudi-financed Islamic Balkan Center in [[Zenica]]. The men were later handed over to SFOR and transferred to [[Guantanamo Bay]].&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt;

On 24 December 2002, Muamer Topalović killed a married couple and their daughter and also wounded their son in village of [[Kostajnica (Konjic)|Kostajnica]]. He claimed that he killed them because of ideological and religious reasons. He was sentenced to 35 years in prison.{{CN|date=January 2018}}

In 2005, the plot to bomb the [[funeral of Pope John Paul II]] was discovered in [[Croatia]]. The plot originated from [[Gornja Maoča]], a [[Wahhabism|Wahhabist]] village in northern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], and included smuggling rocket launchers, explosives and detonators to [[Italy]].{{sfn|Lebl|2014|p=9}} The same year, Bosnian-Herzegovina police raided an apartment connected to a group seeking to blow up the British Embassy in Sarajevo, seizing explosives, rifles, other arms, and a video pledging vengeance for jihadists killed in Afghanistan and Iraq. Amongst the arrested was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] citizen of Bosnian Muslim origin, who ran a website on behalf of [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], head of [[Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn|al-Qaeda in Iraq]].{{sfn|Lebl|2014|p=10}}

The next year, in 2006, a group of Bosnians and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonians]] linked to al-Qaida was arrested in northern Italy, after smuggling 1,800 guns in that country from [[Istanbul]].{{sfn|Lebl|2014|p=10}}

In 2007, Swedish citizen Mirsad Bektašević (8 years and 4 months), [[Turks in Denmark|Danish Turk]] Abdulkadir Cesur (6 and half years) and Bajro Ikanović (4 years) were convicted on charges for terrorism. Bektašević and Cesur traveled to Bosnia in 2005 with intention to commit terrorist attack on unidentified target in Bosnia or elsewhere in Europe. During investigation police seized guns, 20 kilograms of explosives, suicide vests, extremist documents, videos and testament.{{CN|date=January 2018}}

In March 2008, in an operation conducted in [[Sarajevo]] and [[Bugojno]] police arrested Rijad Rustempašić, Abdulah Handžić and Edin Velić. They were accused for preparing terrorist attacks on facilities of [[Government of Republika Srpska]], [[Roman Catholicism in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Roman Catholic Church]], [[EUFOR Althea|EUFOR]] and [[Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Rustempašić was declared guilty and was sentenced on 4 and half years, while Velić and Handžić were sentenced on 3 years and 4 months.{{CN|date=January 2018}}

On 9 October 2008, security guard died in an explosion in shopping center in [[Vitez]]. Several persons were wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glassrpske.com/novosti/vijesti_dana/Teroristicki-napad-u-trznom-centru-Fis-u-Vitezu/lat/12487.html|title=Teroristički napad u tržnom centru Fis u Vitezu|publisher=Glas Srpske|date=9 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amir Ibrahimi, who admitted he was guilty, was sentenced on 2 years in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klix.ba/vijesti/bih/amir-ibrahimi-osudjen-na-dvije-godine-zatvora/100305013|title=Amir Ibrahimi osuđen na dvije godine zatvora

'''Allectus''' (died 296) was a [[Britannic Empire|Roman-Britannic]] [[Roman usurper|usurper]]-[[Roman emperors|emperor]] in [[Roman Britain|Britain]] and northern [[Gaul]] from 293 to 296.&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Schmitz | first = Leonhard | authorlink = Leonhard Schmitz | title = Allectus | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 132 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;idno=acl3129.0001.001;q1=demosthenes;size=l;frm=frameset;seq=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Allectus was [[treasurer]] to [[Carausius]], a [[Menapii|Menapian]] officer in the Roman navy who had seized power in Britain and northern Gaul in 286. In 293 Carausius was isolated when the western [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]], [[Constantius Chlorus]], retook some of his Gallic territories, particularly the crucial port of Bononia (modern [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]]), and defeated his [[Franks|Frankish]] allies in [[Batavians|Batavia]]. Allectus assassinated [[Carausius]] and assumed command himself.
[[File:Constantius I capturing London after defeating Allectus Beaurains hoard.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Medal of [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius I]] capturing [[London]] (inscribed as LON) after defeating Allectus. [[Beaurains Treasure|Beaurains hoard]].]]
His reign has left little record, although his coin issues display a similar distribution to those of Carausius. They are found in north western Gaul, indicating that the recapture of Bononia did not spell the end of the rebel empire on that side of the [[English Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheppard Frere]], ''Britannia: A History of Roman Britain'', third edition, 1987, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantius launched an invasion to depose him in September 296. His forces sailed in several divisions. Constantius led one division from Bononia, but seems to have been delayed by bad weather. Another division, under the [[praetorian prefect]] [[Julius Asclepiodotus|Asclepiodotus]], took advantage of fog to avoid Allectus's ships stationed at the [[Isle of Wight]], and landed near [[Southampton Water]], where they burnt their ships. Allectus's forces were forced to retreat from the coast, but were cut off by another of Constantius's divisions and defeated. Allectus himself was killed in the battle, having removed all insignia in the hope that his body would not be identified. Archaeology suggests that [[Calleva Atrebatum]] ([[Silchester]]) was the site of his defeat or the area surrounding the town.&lt;ref&gt;Frere, ''Britannia'' p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; A group of Roman troops, who had been separated from the main body by the fog during the channel crossing, caught up with the remnants of Allectus's men, mostly Franks, at Londinium ([[London]]), and massacred them. Constantius himself, it seems, did not reach Britain until it was all over, and his [[Panegyrici Latini|panegyrist]] claims he was welcomed by the Britons as a liberator.&lt;ref name="sources"&gt;''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' 8:12-19; [[Aurelius Victor]], ''Book of Caesars'' [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/victor.caes.html#39 39]; [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Abridgement of Roman History'' [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans9.html#21 21-22]; [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], ''Seven Books of History Against the Pagans'' [http://www.attalus.org/latin/orosius7A.html#25 7:25]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carausius had deliberately used his coinage for propaganda purposes, and some of his slogans, such as a claim to have restored 'liberty', were designed to appeal to British sentiment.  Constantius answered such claims in a famous medal struck on the morrow of his victory, in which he described himself as ''redditor lucis aeternae'', 'restorer of the eternal light (viz. of Rome).'

==Legend==
[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] included Allectus in his legendary ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae|History of the Kings of Britain]]'' (ca. 1136). Here, Allectus is an officer sent with three legions by the Romans to depose [[Carausius]], a native British king. He does so, but his rule proves oppressive, and he is in turn deposed by Asclepiodotus, here the duke of Cornwall. The last of Allectus's troops are besieged in London, and surrender on the condition they are granted safe passage out of Britain. Asclepiodotus agrees, but the surrendering soldiers are massacred, and their heads thrown into the river [[Walbrook|Galobroc]], by his allies the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Venedoti]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' [[Wikisource:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 5#4|5.4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{also|Saradha Group financial scandal}}

'''Anubhav Plantations''' was an [[India]]n [[Chennai]]-based [[plantation]] company founded in 1992.&lt;ref name="indiatoday"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aiyar|first1=VS|title=Now a Green Scam|publisher=India Today|date=2 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sold shares in [[teak]] [[Plantation teak|plantations]] on guaranteed interests and later diversified to other schemes through four principal companies: Anubhav Agrotech, Anubhav Green Farms &amp; Resorts, Anubhav Plantations, and Anubhav Royal Orchards Exports.&lt;ref name="fao"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balooni|first1=Kulbhushan (IIM Kozhikode)|title=Teak investment programmes: an Indian perspective|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/x4565e/x4565e05.htm|website=www.fao.org|publisher=FAO Forestry department|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company suddenly closed down in 1998 when it could no longer pay its depositors, leaving its thousands of investors in the lurch and unpaid. Its [[chairman]], C. Natesan, went underground and the other directors claimed ignorance and innocence.&lt;ref name="icmrnew"&gt;{{cite web|title=Case Study - Anubhav scam (Teak plantations scam)|url=http://www.icmrindia.org/casestudies/catalogue/Finance/FINC009.htm|website=www.icmrindia.org|publisher=ICMR India|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident became a major financial scandal in India. The company was subsequently revealed to have been a [[scam]] based on [[fraud]], as teak, being an [[agriculture]]-based [[commodity]], could not promise sure returns. Anubhav was found to have defrauded its depositors of nearly {{INRConvert|400|c|lk=on|year=1998|to=USD EUR}} through [[Ponzi scheme]]s.&lt;ref name="icmr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Case Study - Anubhav Plantations|url=http://www.icmrindia.org/casestudies/catalogue/Finance/FINC009.htm|website=www.icmrindia.org|publisher=ICMR India|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anubhav case is often termed by the Indian media as "The Great Plantation Scam of the 1990s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Muthukrishnan|first1=Daya|title=Planting the dream - Anubhav plantations scam|url=https://wisewealthadvisors.com/2010/07/20/|accessdate=26 October 2016|publisher=More Wealth Advisors|date=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Anubhav group of companies was founded by C. Natesan, a commerce graduate from Chennai's [[Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda College|Vivekananda College]] and a [[Chartered Accountancy Course (India)|chartered accountancy course]] dropout. Natesan started his career in 1983 by launching a consultancy firm called Yours Faithfully Consultancy. In 1984, he started a construction company with three partners. Three years later, in 1987, he closed this venture and set up the Anubhav Foundation, which became the mother company of his future enterprises.&lt;ref name="iim"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balooni|first1=K|title=Commercial agroforestry - a misnomer.|date=1 August 2000|publisher=IIM - Indian Institute of Management|location=Kozhikode, India|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==

In 1991, as part of its post-liberisation process, the [[Indian government]] allowed firms within India to be formed as financial entities. Investment in agricultural commodities, which previously had only been permitted to the [[National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development]] (NABARD), was opened up to the private sector. In this environment, Anubhav Plantations Ltd. (Anubhav) was floated by Natesan as a listed [[public limited company]] in 1992. Over the next six years, the Anubhav umbrella expanded to include various other companies including Anubhav Homes Ltd., Anubhav Resorts Ltd., Anubhav Finance &amp; Investments, Anubhav Communications &amp; Advertising (Pvt.) Ltd., Anubhav Royal Orchards &amp; Exports, Anubhav Hire Purchase Ltd., Anubhav Green Farms &amp; Resorts (Pvt.) Ltd., Anubhav Agro, Anubhav Security Bureau, Anubhav Interiors and Anubhav Health Club. Under these companies, the Anubhav group owned and operated 254 finance firms, including 95 firms of Anubhav finance investments, 169 firms of Anubhav dhan varsha and one firm each of Anubhav Agro and housing developers. Furthermore, the plantation companies themselves had several companies under them. For example, Anubhav plantation had six companies operating under it, including Anubhav Good Earth Unit II, Anubhav Teak Deposit and Anubhav India Limited.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite news|title=Anubhav group investors can file claims for lost money|publisher=One India|date=9 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1998, Anubhav group was worth {{INRConvert|250|c|lk=on}}, and, apart from its teak-plantation schemes, was involved in other enterprises including finance, real estate and [[timeshare]] – a popular enterprise in the recently liberalized Indian economy of the 1990s. These companies were well-structured and backed by a nationwide infrastructure of 91 offices and over 1,800 employees. This included a young, aggressive and highly effective sales force.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kakkar|first1=R.M.R|title=Government may slap blanket ban on plantation schemes|publisher=Telegraph|date=19 July 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modus operandi==

Anubhav investors were offered teak certificates and/or teak shares for investing anything upwards of {{INRConvert|1000}}. These investments were marketed under different confusing and complicated schemes that started to give returns each year of ₹1000 and bumper returns after 20 years to the tune of {{INRConvert|50000}}. While [[NABARD]] stated that only ₹20–30 was actually required to plant a teak tree, plantation firms such as Anubhav justified their charging nearly ten times this amount by including costs for security [[Weed control|de-weeding]] and [[fertilisers]]. Further, Anubhav inflated the expected yield of timber by nearly twenty times the standard that had been generally observed by previous NABARD studies. In return, a teak plant would be planted on their behalf, which could be sold 20 years later. During these 20 years, the certificate would yield around 20% interest for the depositor, yielding returns of around ₹50,000 after 20 years. This was nearly triple the return offered by bank deposits.&lt;ref name="fao"/&gt; The company claimed that it owned teak plantations spread over {{convert|1000|acre|hectare}} of land, and floated attractive advertisements and plush offices, thus encouraging confidence among investors.&lt;ref name="xaam"&gt;{{cite web|title=From Anubhav to Saradha - lessons to be learnt|url=http://www.xaam.in/2015/09/in-fact-from-anubhav-to-saradha-lessons.html|website=www.xaam.in|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anubhav was not the first group to do this. The first attempt to promote private investment in teak plantations occurred in 1991, when a [[Hyderabad]]-based company, Sanghi Plantations, introduced a scheme offering investors teak trees at a nominal cost of ₹1,261 with what later turned out to be an unrealistic return of ₹50,000 after 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Srinivasan|first1=A|title=Money now grows on teak|publisher=Statesman|date=3 March 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teak plantations typically take 50–60 years before yielding returns and are extremely susceptible to weather and the subtleties of the agricultural industry. They have rarely given dependable returns in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chaturvedi|first1=A.N.|title=The viability of commercial teak plantation projects|journal=Indian Forester|date=1 June 1995|volume=121|issue=6|pages=550–552}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the light of general ignorance on the part of most laypeople, Anubhav entered this foray of marketing lucrative teak plantation schemes along with companies such as the [[Parasrampuria]] group, DSJ group and the [[Cochin]]-based "Sterling Tree Magnum", all of whom promised similarly large yet unrealistic returns.&lt;ref name="deb"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Debabrata|first1=K.C.|title=Teak: ecology, silviculture, management and profitability|date=1 July 1999|publisher=International Book Distributors|location=Dehradun, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 1990s, teak plantations mushroomed in southern India, with 40 such companies registered in [[Madras]] and eight in [[Bangalore]] from January to September 1992. Most of these companies did not have adequate crop insurance and none of them were able to live up to their promises. All of them had skewed capital structures. After the 1998 scam and subsequent investigations, [[CRISIL]] subsequently reported that on average, these teak plantation companies had a promoter's contribution of just {{INRConvert|35|l|lk=on}} for every investor's share of ₹300 crore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prasad|first1=RR|title=Teak plantations in India|url=http://www.panamaforestry.com/GTI_Teak_information/Bibliography_and_other_liturture.htm|website=www.panamaforestry.com|publisher=Press Trust of India|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in interviews and announcements in news papers, Natesan unveiled future plans to forward-integrate from teak into furniture and to import machinery to make it. This led to a further increase in small investors. However, his growth strategy was focused mainly on mobilizing funds from investors rather than actually investing in plantations, plants, land and factories. The group had already raised vast sums of money to the tune of more than 400 crore rupees from the public in the form of [[fixed deposits]], so-called "teak units", and a combination of fixed deposits and teak units. Natesan was extremely secretive about the financial performance of his group and this was never revealed to investors, who were happy as long as they received regular interest payments.&lt;ref name="icmr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icmrfull"&gt;{{cite web|title=ICMR Complete Detailed Case Study - Anubhav Plantations|url=http://www.icmrindia.org/free%20resources/casestudies/Finance%20freecasestudyp1.htm|website=www.icmrindia.org|publisher=IBS Centre for Management  Research|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent examinations of the company's accounts revealed that it was posting far higher incomes than its real profits. For example, in 1996–97, the company posted a net profit of ₹38.69 lakh (₹3,869,000) while its plantation income amounted to ₹35.32 crore (₹353,200,000).&lt;ref name="sebi"/&gt; A total of nearly 3,500 teak plantation-based companies were set up in the 1990s in India, all promising interests to the tune of 21–24% when bank deposits gave an interest of just 5–7%.&lt;ref name="fao"/&gt;

During its height in the mid-1990s, the Anubhav group was often described by the media as an example of a successful company (thus becoming a role model for about 530 other teak- and agro-based companies listed by [[SEBI]] that arose during that time and also subsequently defaulted, including Ballarshah teak plantations).&lt;ref name="sebi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Press release by SEBI - 31 October 2003. Status of Collective Investment Schemes (CIS) and List of defaulters|website=www.watchoutinvestors.com|publisher=SEBI - Securities and Exchange Board of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media also portrayed a larger-than-life image of Natesan himself. An ambitious man, Natesan's ostentatious lifestyle, his cars, and his plush office in Chennai's up-market [[Royapettah]] area were frequently cited by the media as examples of his lavish tastes. Natesan had also associated his company with the [[World Wildlife Fund|World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF), thus garnering a positive image for his company.&lt;ref name="ht"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jain|first1=A|title=Finance company officials disappear after fraud|publisher=Hindustan Times|date=24 August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scam of 1998==

In January 1998, cheques issued by Anubhav to its investors began to bounce. Some investors reported that other than the first two payments, all the cheques had bounced. Most of these investors were middle class and [[retired]] Indian [[working-class]] people who had invested their savings in Anubhav. Their amounts varied between ₹15,000 and ₹50,000 per person.&lt;ref name="morewealth"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krishnan|first1=Muthu|title=Letters from Investors - 5 August 2010 to 5 March 2016|url=https://wisewealthadvisors.com/2010/07/20/|accessdate=26 October 2016|publisher=More Wealth Advisors|date=26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They included Indians from large commercial centers such as [[Mumbai]] as well as smaller cities and towns such as [[Pune]], [[Shimla]], [[Trichy]] and [[Sangli]]. In 1998, the company started to default on payments to its investors. On 2 December 1998, a letter was sent to all the investors of Anubhav group to come to the Woodlands hotel in Chennai to receive their long-due payments. When some of the investors landed at Anubhav's offices in [[Royapettah]], they were met with locked doors. The company had closed down, with Natesan absconding.&lt;ref name="icmr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icmrfull"/&gt;

Some of these small investors were themselves on the brink of [[bankruptcy]], having invested their life savings in the Anubhav group and its schemes. The letter that they had received had actually been sent by an advocate from a law firm that was following up the Anubhav group in response to court cases that had been filed against it. The letter invited them to come and check all the records and the balance sheet of the company. The event was covered by newspapers who reported that "...investors could be seen everywhere - sitting on the pavements, standing around the building, walking up and down the roads - all of them tense and worried."&lt;ref name="toi"/&gt;

Many depositors who went to the group's offices in Chennai and other cities to collect their deposit amount after maturity found the doors locked and lodged complaints with the police. Later, thousands of investors demonstrated in front of the company's headquarters in Chennai, however, by then, the main accused, Natesan, had already gone underground.&lt;ref name="xaam"/&gt;

==Aftermath==

Anubhav was eventually found to have duped investors and depositors of over ₹400 crore. As details about what became known as the "Great Plantation Scam of the 1990s" began to be unveiled in the media, and it turned out to be a [[Ponzi scheme]], Natesan's [[modus operandi]] shocked those who had held the Anubhav group in high regard.&lt;ref name="toi"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cheers for plantation scheme investors|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Cheers-for-plantation-scheme-investors/articleshow/37805630.cms|accessdate=26 October 2016|publisher=Times of india|date=18 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A government enquiry was subsequently launched into the Anubhav group. Its investigations revealed that the company had defrauded its investors through various plantation schemes, paying initial interests to old investors by simply channeling them from new investments by new investors.&lt;ref name="icmr"/&gt; A liquidator, M. Ravindran, was appointed by the [[Madras High Court]] to try and repay its depositors at least in part.&lt;ref name="sebi"/&gt; A number of investors formed their own city-based support and action groups to send in their claims, once such group being "The Pune Anubhav Investors' Action Committee (PAIAC)", formed by the 750-odd depositors of Pune who had collectively deposited ₹6 crore.&lt;ref name="toi"/&gt;

Natesan, the chairman and managing director of the Anubhav Group of Companies was subsequently caught by the police and placed in judicial custody, while the filing of the final chargesheet in his criminal case (No. 20501 of 1999) was delayed. The Madras High Court meanwhile issued a non-bailable warrant against S. Shreenivas Rao, one of the directors of the Anubhav Group of Companies. Rao had earlier moved court, requesting that the non-bailable warrant issued by additional chief metropolitan magistrate in Chennai be recalled, as he was director of Anubhav Agrotech and had nothing to do with Anubhav Plantations Ltd.&lt;ref name="toi"/&gt; In its proceedings, the High Court observed that Anubhav Agrotech Ltd. was one among the Anubhav Group, which, in January 1999, became Anubhav Agro Developers. The court observed that there was proof that Anubhav plantation funds were diverted.&lt;ref name="fao"/&gt;

The Anubhav teak plantation scam (often simply referred to as "The Teak Plantations Scam of the 1990s") is often included in the list of scams that occurred in [[Economic liberalisation in India|post-liberalized India]] in the 1990s and has been called "The Great Plantation Scam of the 1990s". However, plantation-related frauds continue to occur in the country, with unsuspecting people lured by promises of high interests. A more recent case, that of Timber World Resorts and Plantations Ltd., which had been launched by a catering college graduate Ashwani Sud from [[Delhi]], turned out to be a similar scam in 2009.&lt;ref name="toidelhi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ghosh|first1=Dwaipayan|title=Tree plantation scheme unearthed, kingpin held|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Tree-plantation-scheme-unearthed-kingpin-held/articleshow/4912575.cms|accessdate=26 October 2016|agency=TNN|publisher=Times of India|date=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 2012, hundreds of [[Gujaratis]] lost their money in a similar tree-plantation scam floated by the [[Ahmedabad|Ellisbridge (Ahmedabad)]]-based company "Golden Trees Plantation Ltd."&lt;ref name="toiah"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shastri|first1=Parth|title=Hundreds lost money in tree plantation scam in state|agency=TNN|publisher=Times of India - Ahmedabad edition|date=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the first to be unearthed, the Anubhav scam was not the largest agro-based scam in India. As per the SEBI, in the subsequent Pearls Agrotech scam, Pearls Agrotech Corporation Limited (PACL) collected {{INRConvert|49100|c|lk=on}} from 5.85 crore (58,500,000) customers over 15 years by offering ambiguous investments linked to agricultural land and its development over a certain period of time.&lt;ref name="xaam"/&gt;

After seven years of judicial custody, Natesan was released on bail in 2007. Of the {{INRConvert|1071233696}} invested by small investors, the company ultimately refunded {{INRConvert|1004464461}} to 31,431 depositors. About {{INRConvert|7|c|0}} has still not been refunded to 2,044 depositors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brarapatre|first1=Ashish|last2=Kapoor|first2=Aditya|last3=Kothari|first3=Bhavik|last4=Gupta|first4=Ankur|title=Planting a dream - Anubhav plantations scheme|website=Slide Share}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4703">{{for|a general article of the scope of real estate brokerage|Real estate broker}}

A '''buyer brokerage''' or '''buyer agency''' is the practice of [[real estate broker]]s and their agents representing a buyer in a real estate transaction rather than, by default, representing the seller either directly or as a [[sub-agent]]. In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]], the most common term is [[buying agent]].

In most U.S. states and Canadian provinces, until the 1990s, buyers who worked with an agent of a real estate broker in finding a house were customers of the brokerage, since, by most [[common law]] of most states at the time, the broker represented only sellers. It is only since the early 1990s that states passed [[statute law]] to create buyers' agency.

Buyer agency can exist exclusively (where a brokerage firm chooses to only represent buyers and never sellers, as an [[exclusive buyer agent]]) or, in a full-service company, by offering buyer agency to buyers who become clients. Buyers would have to agree to some form of dual agency in the event that they wished to buy a home which that company has listed for sale and for which it represents the seller.

Today, if the buyer is working with a broker other than the brokerage listing the property, he or she may choose to enter into a buyer-brokerage agreement to be represented. In some cases where [[real estate broker#dual agency|dual agency]] is permitted by law, even the listing broker may represent the buyer. If the buyer does not enter into this agreement, he/she remains a customer of the broker who is then the sub-agent of seller's broker.

==Buyers as clients==
With the increase in the practice of buyer agency in North America, especially since the late 1990s in most areas, agents (acting under their brokers) have been able to represent buyers in the transaction with a written "buyer agency agreement" not unlike the "[[listing agreement]]" between brokers and sellers (often referred to as a sellers agency). The real estate licensee, upon entering into a written agreement with a buyer, agrees to work solely for the buyer and in return, the buyer agrees to exclusive representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bob Aaron |title=Buyer pays price for jilting agent |url=https://www.thestar.com/comment/columnists/article/415379 |work=Toronto Star |date=2008-04-19 |accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fillmore W. Galaty |author2=Wellington J. Allaway |author3=Robert C. Kyle  |title=Modern real estate practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8cnTKOZS708C&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=%22buyer+agency+agreement%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Xbe2ttSGw5&amp;sig=eB5mXHqmX7Y4H1uJa0-CaLVDBN0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HDsXSoLJNc-Mtge_2MX5DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2 |publisher=Dearborn Real Estate |year=2002 |accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point, a real estate brokerage owes the buyer the duties on
*''Loyalty'' to the buyer by acting in the buyer's best interest.
*''Confidentiality'' by not disclosing facts that could influence the buyers ability to negotiate the best terms.
*''Disclosure'' to other parties in the transaction that the licensee has been engaged as a buyer's agent.

The broker negotiates price and terms on behalf of the buyers and prepares standard real estate purchase contract by filling in the blanks in the contract form.  The buyer's agent acts as a [[fiduciary]] for the buyer.

==Buyer agency agreements==
Like the listing agreement with sellers, the agreements with buyers must have a starting and ending date as well as specifying how the buyer's broker is to be paid (by the seller or by the buyer himself). In addition, it should spell out the duties and obligations of all parties.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The agreement should also specify how a conflict of interest will be handled. A conflict of interest can occur when a buyer represented by a conventional firm becomes interested by a seller who is also represented by that firm.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Another potential conflict of interest can occur when the same firm finds itself representing two buyers who are competing for the same property.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

A real estate agency should have a written, objective policy for how it will handle conflicts of interest and this policy should be disclosed to any potential client in advance.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

'''Cultural leveling''' is the process by which different cultures approach each other as a result of travel and communication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delmar.edu/socsci/rlong/intro/culture.htm Culture], lecture notes, Introductory Sociology, Russ Long, Del Mar College.  Accessed on line November 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also refer to "the process by which Western culture is being exported and diffused into other nations”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6cggAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Strengths-Based Therapy: Connecting Theory, Practice and Skills|last=Jones-Smith|first=Elsie|date=2013-01-09|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781483321981|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural leveling within the United States has been driven by mass market media such as [[Broadcasting|radio and television broadcasting]] and nationwide distribution of [[magazine]]s and catalogs.&lt;ref&gt;p. 247, ''Why Viewers Watch: A Reappraisal of Television's Effects'', Jib Fowles, Sage Publications, 1992, {{ISBN|0-8039-4077-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these means and effects are considered artifacts of the [[Machine Age]] of the 1920s and 1930s. Today the interactions between countries worldwide have allowed the opportunity for intercultural dialogue. Countries world wide have undergone a form of cultural leveling. Some countries being more open to it than others.  Japan, for example, has assimilated Western styles of dress and music into a blend or Western and Eastern Cultures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sociologyguide.com/socio-short-notes/cultural-leveling.php|title=Cultural Leveling|last=|first=|date=2016|website=sociologyguide.com|publisher=Sociology Guide- A Student's Guide to Sociology}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, due to the crossing or travel and communication with time and space there is just about no “other side of the world” anymore, giving us the inevitable result of what is known as cultural leveling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Eclecticism]] and cultural leveling both share a similar ideology in the separation of culture from human nature creating the potential risk or enslavement and manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFscIoQdGw4C&amp;dq=relativism+and+cultural+leveling&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Charity in Truth|last=Pope Benedict XVI|first=|date=2009|website=Google Books|publisher=Ignatius Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural leveling is notably present in minorities instead of large cultures driven to aspire wealth and there is more commonality present in minorities. At times countercultures and subcultures may pose as a resistance to cultural change within society. Local cultures did diffuse across each other in earlier times as material items hence influencing a change in the cultural atmosphere. These diffusions have been part of most significant cultural changes in recorded history. To convey how fundamental the loss of diversity and the subsequent leveling have been, many sociologists such as Daniel Lerner amplified the opinion through the phrase “the passing of traditional society.”

== Relativism and Cultural Leveling Seen as Double Threat ==
Baku (2009), asserted that [[Relativism]] enables diverse cultures to coexist. Meanwhile, cultural leveling eliminates the cultural differences that make a person unique.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zenit.org/articles/relativism-cultural-leveling-seen-as-double-danger/|title=Relativism, Cultural Leveling Seen as Double Danger|last=Baku|first=Azerbaijan|date=November 2009|website=zenit.org|publisher=Zenit Staff|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further more there has seen to be a “commercialization of cultural exchange: that of cultural eclecticism and that of cultural leveling.” &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Cultural leveling results in the standardization of behaviors and lifestyles which sets out to create the danger for losing the significance of cultures and traditions of different countries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Danger lies within cultural leveling such that indiscriminate acceptance of types of conduct and lifestyles. In this way one loses sight of the profound significance of the different nations, of the traditions of the various people, by which the individuals define himself in relation to life’s fundamental questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wwDfXLLM-fsC|title=Social and Cultural Change: Social Science for a Dynamic World|last=Weinstein|first=Jay A.|date=2005-01-01|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780742525740|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transnationality of People, Places and Cultures ==
It is evident that today that both local and global personal interconnectedness is becoming increasingly opaque.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ledanff|first=Susanne|year=2004|title=This big village which is called the world. Metropolises and Globalization in the Twenties in the Journal Der Querschnitt|journal=KulturPoetik|volume=|pages= 82–103|issn=1616-1203|jstor=40621709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Der Querschnitt ===
The golden years of the [[Der Querschnitt]] ranged from 1924 to 1929 when it was edited and achieved the cosmopolitism of its contributions by [[Hermann von Wedderkop]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The journal of the Der Querschnitt contained comparisons of cultures, places and religions followed by the pace in which cultural leveling was progressing within a global perspective.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Der Querschnitt makes the concept of cultural leveling quite easy to identify. The Querschnitt is not only a European journal, but a cosmopolitan one as well as it represents contemporary trends both older and newer. By the end of the twenties, people at both ends of the social scale danced to the same rhythms and listened to the same hit songs as high culture was replaced with a popular new version of the high art of reality, the music of mass entertainment, jazz, and the cinema.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These new trendy concepts claimed that boxing and jazz were the only interesting art forms of the modern age and "negro music" set the standards for what was new and stimulating.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These different changes were seen to be successful mainly because modernity in cities and regions and the interchangeable aspects of modern life fascinated individuals and provided them with a brand new way of life.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Cultural Products in Balkan Countries ==
In the twenties, cities in the Balkans were undergoing overwhelming changes. As a Japanese journalist reports, most of the hairstyles we know today were adopted from the styles and fashion from Tokyo. The hairstyle we commonly know today as the "bob", which is now a major Hollywood style, used to be known as the new Geisha hair cut originating in Tokyo.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The entire region between Budapest and Istanbul displayed the same lifestyle: "jazz bands, gramophones, Chaplin posters, international press, nudist magazines from Berlin, comics from Paris), taxis, symptoms of women’s emancipation in the Turkish- Levantine salons."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Mass produced goods and multicultural unreality of everyday are two aspects of global cultural leveling displayed in the Balkans.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With all the chaotic co-existence of cultural products in the Balkans, reports have stated that it however does not actually frighten the visitor and that people should deal with the chaos of transnational influences that they are suddenly exposed to in the course of time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== National Resistance Against International Modernization ==
Reports from cities such as Prague and Budapest showed odd mannerism and resistance toward modernization during a period of transition, as old European traditions, legends and monuments are deeply rooted in Prague.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Reports on Prague’s sense of national folklore and Budapest’s ambivalent modernity demonstrate how the world's old continent cities cope with cultural leveling.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The German, along with foreign correspondents typically tend to share the "New Sobriety’s" fascination with cultural leveling, while America was consistently referred to as the "cultural model of the future".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Mass culture and technological modernity are typically adopted by large major cities however old traditions place a strain on some cities when it comes to adapting to new trends.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Capital cities tend to imitate each other during the spread of cultural modernity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, "in European capital cities, London was in the shadow of Berlin’s progressive modernity, while prior to that Berlin was in the shadow of Paris."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Economic Leveling Process ==
A great Jewish scholar [[Erich Auerbach]] wrote in his masterpiece [[Mimesis]] during the Second World War: “Beneath the conflicts, and also through them, an economic and cultural leveling process is taking place. It is still a long way to a common life of mankind on earth, but the goal begins to be visible."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ginzburg|first=Carlo|year=2005|title=Latitude, Slaves and the Bible: An Experiment in Microhistory|jstor=10.1086/430989|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=31| issue = 3|pages=665–683|issn=0093-1896|doi=10.1086/430989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, half a century later one hesitates to describe the globalization that was taking place as an “economic leveling process."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Meanwhile, Auerbach looked at cultural leveling with growing worry, however it was an unquestionable reality yet difficult to grasp.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; "In an essay published in 1952, Auerbach remarked that Goethe’s concept of Weltliteratur had become increasingly inadequate, explaining the difficulty of a philologist from a single cultural tradition to be able to approach a world in which so many languages and so many cultural traditions interact."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Erich Auerbach goes into depth about his belief that one must look for both starting points and concrete details from which the "global process can be inductively reconstructed."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the conclusion to Auerbach's Mimesis, he stated "The ongoing unification of the world is most concretely visible now in the unprejudiced, precise, interior and exterior representation of the random moment in the lives of different people.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is the same kind of class struggle approach in the cultural field that they had taken in the economic field, assembling the shortcoming against the privileged. Cultural leveling efforts were forcefully resumed during the early age among many individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xIleCwAAQBAJ|title=Handbook on Class and Social Stratification in China|last=Guo|first=Yingjie|date=2016-01-29|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=9781783470648|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion ==
Religion has always been a main source of cultural change and disruption.  Numerous theoretical strategies have been used to explain religion and its role in society. But, in this age of consequent cultural leveling, no theory of religion would be complete if it failed to include the impact of cultural change on religions and the individuals who follow them.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houk|first=James|year=1996|title=Anthropological Theory and the Breakdown of Eclectic Folk Religions|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume=35| issue = 4|pages=442–447|issn=0021-8294|doi=10.2307/1386420|jstor=1386420}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]], in the words of Brian Morris, believed that "religion was, in a sense, a secondary phenomenon and depended on socioeconomic circumstances. It could only be overcome, therefore,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iNnfCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Culture, Class, and Critical Theory: Between Bourdieu and the Frankfurt School|last=Gartman|first=David|date=2012-11-12|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136169779|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the circumstances that gave rise to religion were themselves transformed."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to A.R. Radcliffe-Brown, "religion is a storehouse for the mores and ethics conducive to a well-functioning society and embodies truth and meaning, and the individual's role is merely one of assimilating the existing belief system."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== The Negative and Positive Outcomes of Cultural Leveling ==
Consequently, through the development of cultural leveling it is evident that some of the negative impacts are the disappearance of dialect in the aspect where individuals who spoke different language gradually disappear as the society acknowledges one language. Other negative outcomes include: the reduction of cultural diversity where individuals lose the significance of being different, loss of cultural uniqueness, loss of cultural heritage, and struggle of accepting the results of cultural leveling.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfVH_gQwq94C|title=Learn Sociology|last=Brent|first=Edward|last2=Lewis|first2=J. Scott|date=2013-03-15|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=9781449672461|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some positive outcomes of cultural leveling include: uniformity, cooperation, and efficient work(common understanding across the board).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Cultural leveling influences cultural aspects to unfold what challenges the present precepts of society.

== Cultural Leveling and Marxism ==
It is evident that communist leaders pursued cultural leveling not only because they remained committed to the Marxist doctrine of eliminating class distinctions, but also because they deeply distrusted the old elites and were determined to prevent them from maintaining and reproducing their class advantage.

In the [[Czech legislative election, 2013|parliamentary election of 2013]] the party obtained 342,339 votes (6.88%),&lt;ref name="totalvotes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Celkové výsledky hlasování|url=https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2013/ps2?xjazyk=CZ|website=volby.cz|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; winning 14 seats.&lt;ref name="mandates"&gt;{{cite web|title=Přehled zisků mandátů|url=https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2013/ps53?xjazyk=CZ&amp;xv=1|website=volby.cz|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included two deputies elected in the [[Central Bohemian Region]], and one each in all others except the [[Plzen Region]] and [[Karlovy Vary Region]].&lt;ref name="mandates"/&gt;

==Party split==
On 19 January 2015, Chief Whip [[Radim Fiala]] was removed and replaced by {{illm|Marek Černoch|cs}}.

In February 2015, most of the nine members of the party and the 14 members of the Dawn parliamentary group decided to establish a new party, without leader Tomio Okamura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/302707-puc-dokonan-dle-okamury-usvit-odsouhlasil-novou-stranu/|title=Puč dokonán dle Okamury, Úsvit odsouhlasil novou stranu|date=24 February 2015|publisher=[[Czech Television]]|language=Czech|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.praguepost.com/czech-news/44325-okamura-cries-putsch|title=Okamura cries ‘putsch!’|date=11 February 2015|publisher=Prague Post|accessdate=26 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226154510/http://www.praguepost.com/czech-news/44325-okamura-cries-putsch|archivedate=26 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 February 2015, Okamura announced that the party was experiencing serious financial difficulties. Since their election to the parliament, the party had been receiving millions of [[Czech crown]]s from the state each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/362743-usvit-je-v-minusu-priznal-okamura-odstoupit-nehodla.html|title=Úsvit je v minusu, přiznal Okamura. Odstoupit nehodlá|last=Lang|first=Václav |date=26 February 2015|publisher=[[novinky.cz]]|language=Czech|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several members of Dawn have created new parties, including [[Freedom and Direct Democracy]], led by Okamura, and the Party of National Interests led by Petr Adam.

[[File:Úsvit Logo 2013.svg|thumb|170px|Original logo of the party]]
On 7 July 2015, Dawn announced plans to merge with the Party of the National Interests, which they did in August the same year. Retired veteran{{clarify|date=May 2017}} Miroslav Lidinský was elected as party chairman and the name was changed to Dawn - National Coalition. They also began working with the We Don't Want Islam in the Czech Republic movement ({{lang-cs|Islám v České republice nechceme}}) led by [[Martin Konvička]]. However, this collaboration also failed soon after, and Dawn's popularity has continued to decline. According to [[Opinion polling for the Czech legislative election, 2017|opinion polling]], Dawn was unlikely to exceed the threshold for entry into parliament at the [[Czech legislative election, 2017|2017 legislative elections]].

Dawn MP Martin Lank left the party in May 2017, which reduced the parliamentary group to six MPs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poslanec Lank opustil Úsvit, míří k Realistům.

Dawn did not participate in the 2017 legislative election. In July 2017, prominent party members stated their intention to participate in local elections in 2018.&lt;ref name="Soumrak Úsvitu.

The '''Department of Immigration and Border Protection''' ('''DIBP''') was a [[Government department|department]] of the [[Government of Australia]] that was responsible for [[Immigration to Australia|immigration]], [[citizenship]] and [[border control]] (including [[Visa policy of Australia|visa issuance]]). It has now been subsumed into the Department of Home Affairs, which combines its responsibilities with a number of other portfolios. 

The final head of department was Secretary Michael Pezzullo, who reported to the [[Minister for Immigration and Border Protection]], [[The Honourable|the Hon]] [[Peter Dutton]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|MP}} and the [[Minister for Immigration and Border Protection#List of Assistant Ministers for Immigration and Border Protection|Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection]], the Hon [[Alex Hawke]] [[MP (Australia)|MP]].

==History==
The Department of Immigration and Border Protection was formed by way of an [[Machinery of government#Australian Government Administrative Arrangement Orders|Administrative Arrangements Order]] issued on 18 September 2013&lt;ref name="AAO Sep 2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpmc.gov.au/parliamentary/docs/aao_20130918.pdf |title=Administrative Arrangements Order |date=18 September 2013 |publisher=[[Commonwealth of Australia]] |accessdate=27 October 2013 |work=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]] |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922235407/http://www.dpmc.gov.au/parliamentary/docs/aao_20130918.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced the majority of the functions previously performed by the former [[Department of Immigration and Citizenship]]; with the exception of most settlement and multicultural affairs programs that were assumed by the [[Department of Human Services (Australia)|Department of Human Services]]. Additionally, the [[Australian Border Force]] and associated policy was assumed by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (previously managed under the authority of the [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's portfolio]], a move intended to ensure stronger integration of border protection resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/about/dept-info/mog.htm|title=Machinery of Government Changes|work=Department of Immigration and Border Protection|publisher=[[Commonwealth of Australia]]|date=18 September 2013|accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/tony-abbott-puts-broom-through-bureaucracy/story-fn59niix-1226721922686 |title=Tony Abbott puts broom through bureaucracy |author=Packham, Ben |newspaper=The Australian |date=18 September 2013 |accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=The Coalition will restore strong, stable and accountable government|url=http://www.pm.gov.au/media/2013-09-18/coalition-will-restore-strong-stable-and-accountable-government|first=Tony|last=Abbott|author-link=Tony Abbott|date=18 September 2013|publisher=[[Commonwealth of Australia]]|work=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]]|location=Canberra, Australia|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/coalition-carves-up-public-service/story-fn59niix-1226722363408 |title=Coalition carves up the public service |author=Wilson, Lauren |newspaper=The Australian |date=19 September 2013 |accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901, [[immigration to Australia]] was handled by the Department of External Affairs. In 1916 responsibility shifted to the newly created Department of Home and Territories. Migration was handled from 1928 until 1932 by a recreated Department of Home Affairs and from 1932 until 1945 by the Department of the Interior, except that between January 1925 and January 1928 [[Reginald Wilson (Australian politician)|Reginald Wilson]] and [[Thomas Paterson]] were Ministers for Markets and Migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/nlanews/2005/jun05/article4.html |title=From Calwell Onward: Immigration Ministers in the Library’s Oral History Collection |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]] |date=June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1945, the Department of Immigration was established as Australia launched a massive [[Immigration to Australia|immigration program]] following [[World War II]]. The then [[Minister for Immigration and Border Protection|Minister for Immigration]], [[Arthur Calwell]] promoted mass immigration with the slogan "populate or perish".&lt;ref name=establishment&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/statistics/federation/timeline1.pdf |format=PDF |title=Immigration to Australia During the 20th Century – Historical Impacts on Immigration Intake, Population Size and Population Composition – A Timeline |publisher=Department of Immigration and Citizenship (Australia) |date=2001 |accessdate=18 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918004322/http://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/statistics/federation/timeline1.pdf  |archivedate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1945, the department's names, functions and responsibilities have changed several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.immi.gov.au/about/anniversary/whats-in-a-name.htm |title=What's in a Name? |author=Department of Immigration and Border Protection |publisher=Department of Immigration and Border Protection |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123005605/https://www.immi.gov.au/about/anniversary/whats-in-a-name.htm |archivedate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present departmental title, Department of Home Affairs, refers to a combined department covering law enforcement, national and transport security, criminal justice, emergency management, multicultural affairs and immigration and border control.  Departmental writing guide mandates the use of "Home Affairs" as a shortened form of the Department's name. {{cn|date=November 2018}} DHA is exclusively used by Defence Housing Australia.

Over the years, the department has been the centre of controversy in regards to the Australian Government's policies of [[Immigration detention in Australia|mandatory detention]] of [[unauthorised arrivals]], the [[Pacific Solution]], and the treatment of asylum seekers that was criticised in the [[Palmer report|Palmer]] and [[Comrie report]]s in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/palmer-progress/ Palmer Report: Two Years of Progress, Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kevin Rudd|Rudd]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government announced the end of mandatory detention in Australia in July 2008, unless the asylum seeker was deemed to pose a risk to the wider community, such as those who have repeatedly breached their visa conditions or those who have security or health risks.

On 1 July 2015, the Migration Review Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Social Security Appeals Tribunal became divisions of the [[Administrative Appeals Tribunal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aat.gov.au/resources/fact-sheets/the-amalgamated-aat|title=The Amalgamated AAT - Administrative Appeals Tribunal|work=aat.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational activities==
In an [[Machinery of government#Australian Government Administrative Arrangement Orders|Administrative Arrangements Order]] made on 18 September 2013, the functions of the department were broadly classified into the following matters:&lt;ref name="AAO Sep 2013"/&gt;

*Entry, stay and departure arrangements for non-citizens
*Border immigration control
*Citizenship
*Ethnic affairs
*Customs and border control other than [[quarantine]] and inspection

===Migration program===
[[File:Australian immigration statistics (1996 - 2010) by skill stream.jpg|thumb|Immigration program outcomes (1996 - 2010)]]
The size and composition of Australia’s permanent migration program is reviewed annually to maximise its potential. The 2010–11 migration program was set at 168,700 places—an overall total which was unchanged from 2009–10. Within this total, the skill stream was allocated 113 850 places to address current and emerging skill shortages in critical occupations and regions. The family stream was set at 54 550 places, recognising the benefits that accrue when Australians have their parents, partners, carers or children join them to live in Australia permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/about/reports/annual/2010-11/html/secretarys-review/year-at-a-glance.htm |title=The year at a glance - Annual Report 2010–11 |publisher=Immi.gov.au |date=2011-06-30 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2010, a new skilled occupation list was introduced for the general skilled migration. A new points test emphasising the importance of English language proficiency, work experience and higher level qualifications was announced and implemented on 1 July 2011. In addition, state migration plans were implemented for each state and territory to provide greater flexibility for state and territory governments to nominate skilled migrants in a broader range of occupations specific to their skill shortage needs than are currently offered through the skilled occupation list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/about/reports/annual/2010-11/html/outcome-1/program1-1.htm |title=Program 1.1 Visa and migration - Annual Report 2010–11 |publisher=Immi.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2014-15 migration program, 68 per cent are skilled migrants and 32 per cent are from family visa streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.border.gov.au/about/reports-publications/research-statistics/statistics/live-in-australia/migration-programme|title=Migration programme statistics|publisher=border.gov.au|date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanitarian program===
Australia is within the top three humanitarian resettlement countries in the world. Under the humanitarian program, the department granted 13,799 visas in 2010–11. Of these, 8971 were granted offshore and 4828 were granted onshore. The Woman at Risk target of 12 per cent of refugee grants (720 grants) was exceeded, with 759 visas granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/about/reports/annual/2010-11/html/outcome-2/program2-1.htm |title=Program 2.1 Refugee and humanitarian assistance - Annual Report 2010-2011 |publisher=Immi.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of complementary protection legislation into parliament on 24 February 2011, was a development in relation to Australia's commitment to fulfilling its international obligations under the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|Refugee Convention]]. This was expected to improve the efficiency of decision-making by providing more accountable assessments of asylum seekers’ protection claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/61a-complementary.htm |title=Australian Immigration Fact Sheet 61a Complementary Protection |publisher=Immi.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citizenship===
[[File:Country Citizenship Ceremony - (26-01-07).jpg|thumb|[[Australia Day]] citizenship ceremony, 2007]]
The department’s citizenship course provides an alternative pathway for taking the final step towards becoming an Australian citizen. In 2010–11, 27 citizenship courses were delivered across metropolitan and regional areas in Australia, and about 74,000 citizenship tests were administered globally during the year.

On 26 January 2011, [[Australia Day]], approximately 13,000 people became Australian citizens in about 325 citizenship ceremonies hosted by local councils and community groups across the country. [[Brisbane]] City Council, despite the devastating floods, hosted the largest Australia Day 2011 citizenship ceremony with more than 1,000 people becoming citizens at the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/about/reports/annual/2010-11/html/outcome-6/program6-1.htm |title=Program 6.1 Multicultural and citizenship services—Outcome 6—Annual Report 2010-2011 |publisher=Immi.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Border security===
There are more than 30 million movements across Australia’s borders every year. By 2020, indications are that these numbers are likely to increase to approximately 45 million movements per year.

The department collects biometrics{{clarify|date=January 2014}} to help verify the identity of visa applicants in any future visa encounters. From December 2010, biometrics began to be collected across 15 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East. This initiative was undertaken in collaboration with the [[UK Border Agency|predecessor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/about/reports/annual/2010-11/html/outcome-3/program3-1.htm |title=Program 3.1 Border management - Annual Report 2010-2011 |publisher=Immi.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[UK Visas and Immigration]].

===Immigration detention===
A new immigration detention services group was established in 2011 to implement policy, manage contractors and coordinate detention operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/about/reports/annual/2010-11/html/outcome-4/immigration-detention-stats.htm |title=Programs 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4—immigration detention statistics and services - Annual Report 2010–11 |publisher=Immi.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Difret''''' is a 2014 Ethiopian [[drama film]] written and directed by [[Zeresenay Berhane Mehari]]. The film had its premiere in-competition at the [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]] where it won the World Cinematic Dramatic Audience Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sundance 2014: World Cinema Dramatic Competition|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/sundance-2014-world-cinema-dramatic-competition|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Cinema Dramatic Competition |url=http://filmguide.sundance.org/event/films/category/WDC |accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angelina Jolie]] served as the executive producer of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sundance 2014: Angelina Jolie Joins Ethiopian Film 'Difret' as Executive Producer|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sundance-2014-angelina-jolie-joins-671439|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film later premiered at the [[64th Berlin International Film Festival]] in the Panorama section,&lt;ref name="Berlin"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/presse/pressemitteilungen/alle/Alle-Detail_21525.html |title=Panorama 2014: Selection of Fictional Features for Main Programme and Panorama Special Now Complete |accessdate=19 January 2014 |work=berlinale}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Difret"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/programm/berlinale_programm/datenblatt.php?film_id=20143025#tab=filmStills |title=Difret |accessdate=7 February 2014 |work=berlinale}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it won the Audience Award.&lt;ref name="Panoroma"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/presse/pressemitteilungen/panorama/pan-presse-detail_22932.html |title=Panorama 64th Berlinale |accessdate=16 February 2014 |work=Berlinale}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was selected as the Ethiopian entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[87th Academy Awards]], but was not nominated.&lt;ref name="Ethiopia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tadias.com/10/11/2014/difret-submitted-for-oscar-consideration-for-best-foreign-language-film/ |title=‘Difret’ Submitted for Oscar Consideration for Best Foreign Language Film |accessdate=11 October 2014 |work=Tadias}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TotalSub"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/news/83-countries-competition-2014-foreign-language-film-oscarr |title=83 Countries In Competition For 2014 Foreign Language Film Oscar |accessdate=10 October 2014 |work=AMPAS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TotalHWR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscar-attracts-best-foreign-language-739698 |title=Oscar Attracts Best Foreign Language Film Submissions From a Record 83 Countries |accessdate=10 October 2014 |work=Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title ({{Lang-am|ድፍረት}}) literally translates as "[[courage]]", "[[Boldness|audacity]]",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amharicproject.com/2014/10/fretting-over-difret.html&lt;/ref&gt; but can also be a euphemism for "the act of being raped."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diplomaticourier.com/difret/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film chronicles a legal-precedent setting court case that outlawed the [[Bride kidnapping|kidnapping of child brides]] (ጠለፈ ''tʼelefa'') in [[Ethiopia]]. It tells the story of a 14-year-old girl, Hirut Assefa (based on Aberash Bekele), who is kidnapped on her way home from school and subsequently grabs a rifle and tries to escape, but ends up shooting her would-be husband. In her village, the practice of abduction into marriage is common and one of Ethiopia's oldest traditions. [[Meaza Ashenafi]], the founder of the [[Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association]] (EWLA), arrives from the city to have her team represent Hirut and argue that she acted in self-defence.

==Cast==
* [[Meron Getnet]] as Meaza Ashenafi
* Tizita Hagere as Hirut Assefa

==Controversy==
The film was temporarily banned in September 2014 for allegedly giving "too much credit" to Ashenafi, according to a complaint by Bekele, on whose experience the film was based. The case settled out of court and the ban was ultimately lifted. The film's director, Mehari, apologized to Bekele for "any misperception and for any harm that [they] may have caused."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethiopiaobserver.com/ban-on-difret-film-lifted/|title=Ban on Difret film lifted  - Ethiopia Observer|work=ethiopiaobserver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film subsequently enjoyed a successful theatrical run in Ethiopia and kicked off its educational outreach efforts that are focused on raising awareness about the issue of child marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mehret-mandefro/difret-building-a-culture_b_5760922.html|title=Difret: Building a Culture of Courage|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashenafi's leadership and administration of EWLA during this time is the reason she has received several international human rights awards including the Africa Prize of [[The Hunger Project]] for her work defending vulnerable women and children in Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethiopia.usembassy.gov/pr0808.html|title=Press Release 2008 - Embassy of the United States Addis Ababa, Ethiopia|work=usembassy.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Difret'' received mixed reviews upon its premiere at the [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]]. Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', said in his review that "'Difret' presents an important message, albeit in rather clunky narrative terms. More showing and less telling would have made this fact-inspired drama by Zeresenay Berhane Mehari as artistically compelling as it is informative. Still, fests and other outlets attracted to social-justice issues will queue up for this relatively rare export-ready Ethiopian feature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sundance Film Review: ‘Difret’|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/sundance-film-review-difret-1201069956/|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd van Hoeij in his review for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called the film "A quiet and powerful drama, based on a true story, that relies on familiar storytelling tropes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Difret: Sundance Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/difret-sundance-review-674060|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has a score of 58% on Metacritic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/difret|title=Difret|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of the United States}}

'''Elections in the United States''' are held for [[Official|government officials]] at the [[Federal government of the United States|federal]], [[State governments of the United States|state]], and [[Local government in the United States|local]] levels. At the federal level, the nation's [[head of state]], the [[President of the United States|President]], is elected indirectly by the people of each [[U.S. state|state]], through an [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. Today, these electors almost always vote with the popular vote of their state. All members of the federal legislature, the [[United States Congress|Congress]], are directly elected by the people of each state. There are many elected offices at state level, each state having at least an elective [[Governor (United States)|Governor]] and [[State legislature (United States)|legislature]]. There are also elected offices at the local level, in [[County (United States)|counties]], cities, towns, townships, boroughs, and villages. According to a study by political scientist Jennifer Lawless, there were 519,682 elected officials in the United States {{as of|2012|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://images.dailykos.com/images/134822/large/Elected_officials.png?1426881549 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331045111/http://images.dailykos.com/images/134822/large/Elected_officials.png?1426881549 |archivedate=March 31, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[United States Constitution]] does set parameters for the election of federal officials, state law, not federal, regulates most aspects of elections in the U.S., including primaries, the eligibility of voters (beyond the basic constitutional definition), the running of each state's electoral college, as well as the running of state and local elections. All elections—federal, state, and local—are administered by the individual states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/elections-and-voting |title=Elections &amp; Voting |date=April 2, 2015 |website=Whitehouse.gov |access-date=October 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Voting rights in the United States|restriction and extension of voting rights to different groups]] has been a contested process throughout United States history. The federal government has also been involved in attempts to increase [[voter turnout]], by measures such as the [[National Voter Registration Act of 1993]]. The financing of elections has also long been controversial, because private sources make up substantial amounts of campaign contributions, especially in federal elections. Voluntary public funding for candidates willing to accept spending limits was introduced in 1974 for presidential primaries and elections. The [[Federal Elections Commission]], created in 1975 by an amendment to the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]], has the responsibility to disclose campaign finance information, to enforce the provisions of the law such as the limits and prohibitions on contributions, and to oversee the public funding of U.S. presidential elections.

==Voting==
The most common method used in U.S. elections is the [[first-past-the-post]] system, where the highest polling candidate wins the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Since 2002, several cities have adopted [[Instant-runoff voting in the United States|instant-runoff voting]] in their elections. Voters rank the candidates in order of preference rather than voting for a single candidate. If a candidate secures more than half of votes cast, that candidate wins. Otherwise, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. Ballots assigned to the eliminated candidate are recounted and assigned to those of the remaining candidates who rank next in order of preference on each ballot. This process continues until one candidate wins by obtaining more than half the votes.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} In [[Maine Question 5, 2016|2016]], [[Maine]] became the first state to adopt instant-runoff voting (known in the state as ranked-choice voting) statewide for its elections, although due to state constitutional provisions, the system is only used for federal elections and state primaries.

===Eligibility===
{{main|Voting rights in the United States}}
The eligibility of an individual for voting is set out in the constitution and also regulated at state level. The constitution states that suffrage cannot be denied on grounds of [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|race or color]], [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|sex]], or [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|age for citizens eighteen years or older]]. Beyond these basic qualifications, it is the responsibility of [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] to regulate voter eligibility. Some states ban convicted criminals, [[Felony disenfranchisement|especially felons]], from voting for a fixed period of time or indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/should-convicted-felons-be-allowed-to-vote-after-theyve-served-their-time/|title=Should Felons Be Allowed to Vote After They Have Served Their Time?|first=Michael|last=Gonchar|website=Learning.blogs.nytimes.com|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of American adults who are currently or permanently ineligible to vote due to felony convictions is estimated to be 5.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Voter registration===
{{main|Voter registration in the United States}}
While the federal government has jurisdiction over federal elections, most election laws are decided at the [[U.S. state|state]] level. All U.S. states except [[North Dakota]] require that citizens who wish to vote be [[Voter registration in the United States|registered]]. Traditionally, voters had to register at state offices to vote, but in the mid-1990s efforts were made by the federal government to make registering easier, in an attempt to increase turnout. The [[National Voter Registration Act of 1993]] (the "Motor Voter" law) required state governments that receive certain types of federal funding to make the voter registration process easier by providing uniform registration services through drivers' license registration centers, disability centers, schools, libraries, and mail-in registration. Other states allow citizens same-day registration on Election Day.

In many states, citizens registering to vote may declare an affiliation with a [[List of political parties in the United States|political party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lwv.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;section=Navigation_Election_Day&amp;template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentFileID=1069]  {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20061005193630/http://www.lwv.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;section=Navigation_Election_Day&amp;template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentFileID=1069|date=October 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration of affiliation does not cost money, and does not make the citizen a dues-paying member of a party. A party cannot prevent a voter from declaring his or her affiliation with them, but it can refuse requests for full membership. In some states, only voters affiliated with a party may vote in that party's [[primary election]]s ([[#Primaries and caucuses|see below]]). Declaring a party affiliation is never required. Some states, including [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[Virginia]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], practice non-partisan registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.votesmart.org/voter_registration_resources.php |title=Voter Registration Resources |publisher=[[Project Vote Smart]] |accessdate=30 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030145853/http://www.votesmart.org/voter_registration_resources.php |archivedate=October 30, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absentee voting===
[[File:Miltonballotpaper.jpg|thumb|An absentee ballot paper for [[Milton, New Hampshire]].  This ballot also contains a referendum placed on the ballot by the state legislature.]]
Voters unable or unwilling to vote at polling stations on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] can vote via [[absentee ballot]]s. Absentee ballots are most commonly sent and received via the [[United States Postal Service]]. Despite their name, absentee ballots are often requested and submitted in person. About half of all states and U.S. territories allow "no excuse absentee," where no reason is required to request an absentee ballot. Others require a valid reason, such as infirmity or travel, be given before a voter can participate using an absentee ballot. Some states, including California,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_m.htm#perm Permanent Absentee Voting in California], via sos.ca.gov&lt;/ref&gt; and Washington&lt;ref&gt;[[Absentee ballot#Washington State|Washington State]] section of Absentee Ballot&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.secstate.wa.gov/elections/register_absentee.aspx
| title=Voting by Absentee Ballot in Washington state.
| publisher=[[Secretary of State of Washington]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; allow citizens to apply for permanent absentee voter status, which will automatically receive an absentee ballot for each election. Typically a voter must request an absentee ballot before the election occurs.

A significant source of absentee ballots is the population of Americans living outside the United States. In 1986 Congress enacted the [[Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act]] (UOCAVA). UOCAVA requires that the states and territories allow members of the United States Uniformed Services and merchant marine, their family members, and United States citizens residing outside the United States to register and vote absentee in elections for Federal offices. Though many states had pre-existing statutes in place UOCAVA made it mandatory and nationally uniform. "Generally, all U.S. citizens 18 years or older who are or will be residing outside the United States during an election period are eligible to vote absentee in any election for Federal office. In addition, all members of the Uniformed Services, their family members and members of the Merchant Marine and their family members, who are U.S. citizens, may vote absentee in Federal, state and local elections."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fvap.gov/faq.html|title=Federal Voting Assistance Program questions and answers|website=Fvap.gov|accessdate=14 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322213216/http://www.fvap.gov/faq.html|archivedate=March 22, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absentee ballots from these voters can often be transmitted private delivery services, [[fax]], or [[email]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fvap.gov/ivas/fvap_state_menu.html|title=FVAP Integrated Voting Alternative Site (IVAS)|website=Fvap.gov|accessdate=October 14, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235329/http://www.fvap.gov/ivas/fvap_state_menu.html|archivedate=September 27, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mail ballots===
Mail ballots are similar in many respects to an absentee ballot. However they are used for ''Mailing Precincts'' where on Election Day no polling place is opened for a specific precinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessclarkcounty.com/depts/election/English/pages/Mail.aspx#what_is_mail_ballot_voting |title=MAIL (ABSENTEE) BALLOT VOTING |accessdate=2008-08-08 |work= |publisher= [[Clark County, Nevada]] |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Colorado]], all ballots are delivered through the mail.

===Early voting===
{{main|Early voting#United States}}
Early voting is a formal process where voters can cast their ballots prior to the official Election Day. Early voting in person is allowed in 33 states and in [[Washington, D.C.]], with no excuse required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx | title=Absentee and Early Voting | publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures | accessdate=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting equipment===

{{further|Voting machine}}
Voters casting their ballots in polling places record their votes most commonly with [[Optical scan voting system|optical scan voting machines]] or [[DRE voting machine]]s. Voting machine selection is typically done through a state's local election jurisdiction including counties, cities, and townships. Many of these local jurisdictions have changed their voting equipment since 2000 due to the passage of the [[Help America Vote Act]] (HAVA), which allocated funds for the replacement of [[Voting machine#Direct-recording voting system|lever machine]] and [[Voting machine#Punch card|punch card]] voting equipment.

Since the 1980s many jurisdictions and voting locations have given out "I Voted" [[sticker]]s to people casting ballots. In the state of [[Illinois]] it is a state law to have stickers available to voters after they have cast their ballots. State and local governments pay $30 million per year for the stickers that cost about one cent each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nelson |first1=Libby |url=https://www.vox.com/presidential-election/2016/11/8/13553112/i-voted-sticker |title="I Voted" stickers, explained |work=Vox |publisher=[[Vox Media, Inc.]] |date=2016-11-08 |accessdate=2016-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levels of election==

===Federal elections===
{{see also|Election Day (United States)}}
The United States has a [[presidential system]] of government, which means that the executive and legislature are elected separately. Article One of the United States Constitution requires that any election for the U.S. President must occur on a single day throughout the country; elections for Congressional offices, however, can be held at different times. Congressional and [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]] take place simultaneously every four years, and the intervening Congressional elections, which take place every two years, are called [[Midterm elections]].

The constitution states that members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] must be at least 25 years old, a citizen of the United States for at least seven years, and be a (legal) inhabitant of the state they represent. Senators must be at least 30 years old, a citizen of the United States for at least nine years, and be a (legal) inhabitant of the state they represent. The President and Vice President must be at least 35 years old, a natural born citizen of the United States and a resident in the United States for at least fourteen years. It is the responsibility of state legislatures to regulate the qualifications for a candidate appearing on a ballot paper, although in order to get onto the ballot, a candidate must often collect a legally defined number of signatures.

====Presidential elections====
{{main|United States presidential election|Electoral College (United States)}}
The President and the Vice President are elected together in a Presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/statistics/214833/state-of-the-nation-before-presidential-elections/ Statistics on the State of the Nation Before the Presidential Elections (2007 and 2011)], Pew Research Center, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[indirect election]], with the winner being determined by votes cast by electors of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. In modern times, voters in each state select a slate of electors from a list of several slates designated by different parties or candidates, and the electors typically promise in advance to vote for the candidates of their party (whose names of the presidential candidates usually appear on the ballot rather than those of the individual electors).  The winner of the election is the candidate with at least 270 Electoral College votes. It is possible for a candidate to win the [[electoral vote]], and lose the (nationwide) [[Representative democracy|popular vote]] (receive fewer votes nationwide than the second ranked candidate). Prior to ratification of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (1804), the runner-up in a Presidential election&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/us-elections-2012 U.S. Elections 2012], The Economist, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; became the Vice President.

Electoral College votes are cast by individual states by a group of electors; each elector casts one electoral college vote.  Until the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution]] of 1961 the [[District of Columbia]] citizens did not have representation and/or electors in the electoral college. In modern times, with electors usually committed to vote for a party candidate in advance, electors that vote against the popular vote in their state are called [[faithless elector]]s, and occurrences are rare. State law regulates how states cast their electoral college votes. In all states except [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]], the candidate that wins the most votes in the state receives all its electoral college votes (a "winner takes all" system). From 1969 in Maine, and from 1991 in Nebraska, two electoral votes are awarded based on the winner of the statewide election, and the rest (two in Maine, three in Nebraska) go to the highest vote-winner in each of the state's congressional districts.

{{United States presidential elections}}

====Congressional elections====
Congress has two [[bicameralism|chambers]]: the Senate and the House of Representatives.

=====Senate elections=====
The [[United States Senate|Senate]] has 100 members, elected for a six-year term in dual-seat [[constituency|constituencies]] (2 from each [[U.S. state|state]]), with one-third being renewed every two years. The group of the Senate seats that is up for election during a given year is known as a "[[Classes of United States Senators|class]]"; the three classes are staggered so that only one of the three groups is renewed every two years. Until the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1913, States chose how to elect Senators, and they were often elected by state legislatures, not the electorate of states.
{{United States Senate elections}}

=====House of Representatives elections=====
[[File:USHouseBalanceOverTime.png|thumbnail|320px|A chart of party balance in the House]]
The [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] has 435 members, elected for a two-year term in single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]]. House of Representatives elections are held every two years on the first Tuesday after November 1 in even years. Special House elections can occur between if a member dies or resigns during a term. House elections are [[first-past-the-post]] elections that elect a Representative from each of 435 House districts which cover the United States.  The non-voting [[Delegate (United States Congress)|delegates]] of [[Washington, D.C.]] and the territories of [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands]] are also elected.

House elections occur every two years, correlated with [[U.S. presidential election|presidential elections]] or halfway through a President's term. The House delegate of Puerto Rico, officially known as the [[Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico]], is elected to a four-year term, coinciding with those of the President.

As the redistricting commissions of states are often partisan, districts are often drawn which benefit incumbents. An increasing trend has been for incumbents to have an overwhelming advantage in House elections, and since the [[United States House election, 1994|1994 election]], an unusually low number of seats has changed hands in each election.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}  Due to [[gerrymandering]], fewer than 10% of all House seats are contested in each election cycle. Over 90% of House members are reelected every two years, due to lack of electoral competition. Gerrymandering of the House, combined with the divisions inherent in the design of the Senate and of the Electoral College, result in a discrepancy between the percentage of popular support for various political parties and the actual level of the parties' representation.
{{United States House of Representatives elections}}

===State elections===
State law and state constitutions, controlled by [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] regulate elections at state level and local level. Various officials at state level are elected. Since the separation of powers applies to states as well as the federal government, state legislatures and the executive (the governor) are elected separately. [[Governor (United States)|Governors]] and [[Lieutenant governor (United States)|lieutenant governor]] are elected in all states, in some states on a joint ticket and in some states separately, some separately in different [[Electoral cycle approach|electoral cycles]]. The governors of the territories of [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands]] are also elected. In some states, executive positions such as [[State Attorney General|Attorney General]] and [[state Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] are also elected offices. All members of state legislatures and territorial jurisdiction legislatures are elected. In some states, members of the [[state supreme court]] and other members of the state judiciary are elected. Proposals to amend the state constitution are also placed on the ballot in some states.

As a matter of convenience and cost saving, elections for many of these state and local offices are held at the same time as either the federal presidential or midterm elections. There are a handful of states, however, that instead hold their elections during odd-numbered "[[Off-year elections|off years]]."
{{United States gubernatorial elections}}

===Local elections===
At the local level, [[Counties of the United States|county]] and city government positions are usually filled by election, especially within the legislative branch. The extent to which offices in the executive or judicial branches are elected vary from county-to-county or city-to-city. Some examples of local elected positions include sheriffs at the county level and mayors and school board members at the city level. Like state elections, an election for a specific local office may be held at the same time as either the presidential, midterm, or off-year elections.

==Comparison of recent and upcoming election years==
{{US elections}}

==Features of the election system==

===Multiple levels of regulation===
In the US elections are actually conducted by local authorities, working under local, state, and federal law and regulation, as well as the US Constitution.  It is a highly decentralized system.&lt;ref name=NCSL&gt;{{cite web|title=Election Administration at State and Local Levels|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/election-administration-at-state-and-local-levels.aspx|publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures|date=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In around half of US states, the [[Secretary of State]] is the official in charge of elections; in other states it is someone appointed for the job, or a commission.&lt;ref name=NCSL/&gt;  It is this person or commission who is responsible for certifying, tabulating, and reporting votes for the state.&lt;ref name=NCSL/&gt;

===Party systems===
{{main|Party system|Politics of the United States}}
Americans vote for a specific candidate instead of directly selecting a particular political party. The [[United States Constitution]] has never formally addressed the issue of political parties. The [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] such as [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]] did not support domestic [[political faction]]s at the time the Constitution was written.&lt;ref&gt;In [[Federalist No. 9|Federalist Papers No. 9]] and [[Federalist No. 10|No. 10]], Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, respectively, wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic political factions.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the first [[President of the United States]], [[George Washington]], was not a member of any political party at the time of his election or throughout his tenure as president.  Furthermore, he hoped that political parties [[Washington's Farewell Address|would not be formed]], fearing conflict and stagnation.  Nevertheless, the beginnings of the American [[two-party system]] emerged from his immediate circle of advisers, with Hamilton and Madison ending up being the core leaders in this emerging party system.

Thus, it is up to the candidate to decide under what party he/she should run, registers to run, pays the fees, etc. In the [[primary elections]], the party organization stays neutral until one candidate has been elected. The platform of the party is written by the winning candidate (in presidential elections; in other elections no platform is involved). Each candidate has his or her own campaign, fund raising organization, etc. The primary elections in the main parties are organized by the states, who also register the party affiliation of the voters (this also makes it easier to [[gerrymander]] the congressional districts). The party is thus little more than a campaign organization for the main elections.

However, elections in the United States often do become ''de facto'' national races between the political parties. In what is known as "[[Coattail effect|presidential coattails]]", candidates in presidential elections usually bring out supporters who then vote for his or her party's candidates for other offices, usually resulting in the presidential winner's party gaining seats in Congress. On the other hand, midterm elections are sometimes regarded as a referendum on the sitting president's and/or incumbent party's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/07/AR2006110701697.html | title=A Voter Rebuke For Bush, the War And the Right | publisher=Washington Post | date=2006-11-08 | quote=Bush and senior adviser Karl Rove tried to replicate that strategy this fall, hoping to keep the election from becoming a referendum on the president's leadership. | first1=Peter | last1=Baker | first2=Jim | last2=VandeHei | accessdate=2010-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|  url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/11/04/impeachment/ | title=Election '98 Lewinsky factor never materialized| publisher=CNN | date=1998-11-04 | quote=Americans shunned the opportunity to turn Tuesday's midterm elections into a referendum on President Bill Clinton's behavior, dashing Republican hopes of gaining seats in the House and Senate.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a historical pattern that the incumbent president's party loses seats in midterm elections. This may be because the President's popularity has slipped since election, or because the President's popularity encouraged supporters to come out to vote for him or her in the presidential election, but these supporters are less likely to vote when the President is not up for election.

===Ballot access===
{{main|Ballot access}}
Ballot access refers to the laws which regulate under what conditions access is granted for a candidate or political party to appear on voters' ballots. Each State has its own ballot access laws to determine who may appear on ballots and who may not. According to Article I, Section 4, of the United States Constitution, the authority to regulate the time, place, and manner of federal elections is up to each State, unless Congress legislates otherwise. Depending on the office and the state, it may be possible for a voter to cast a [[write-in]] vote for a candidate whose name does not appear on the ballot, but it is extremely rare for such a candidate to win office.

===Campaign finance===
{{main|Campaign finance in the United States}}
The funding of electoral campaigns has always been a controversial issue in American politics. Infringement of [[free speech]] ([[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]) is an argument against restrictions on campaign contributions, while allegations of corruption arising from unlimited contributions and the need for political equality are arguments for the other side.&lt;ref&gt;See Anthony Gierzynski, Saving American Elections: A Diagnosis and Prescription for a Healthier Democracy (Cambria Press, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Private funds are a major source of finance, from individuals and organizations. The first attempt to regulate campaign finance by legislation was in 1867, but major legislation, with the intention to widely enforce, on campaign finance was not introduced until the 1970s.

Money contributed to campaigns can be classified into "hard money" and "soft money". Hard money is money contributed directly to a campaign, by an individual or organization. Soft money is money from an individual or organization not contributed to a campaign, but spent in candidate specific advertising or other efforts that benefits that candidate by groups supporting the candidate, but legally not coordinated by the official campaign.

The [[Federal Election Campaign Act]] of 1971 required candidates to disclose sources of campaign contributions and campaign expenditure. It was amended in 1974 to legally limit campaign contributions. It banned direct contributing to campaigns by corporations and trade unions and limited individual donations to $1,000 per campaign. It introduced public funding for Presidential primaries and elections. The Act also placed limits of $5,000 per campaign on PACs ([[political action committee]]s). The limits on individual contributions and prohibition of direct corporate or labor union campaigns led to a huge increase in the number of PACs. Today many labor unions and corporations have their own PACs, and over 4,000 in total exist. The 1974 amendment also specified a [[Federal Election Commission]], created in 1975 to administer and enforce campaign finance law. Various other provisions were also included, such as a ban on contributions or expenditures by foreign nationals (incorporated from the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]] (FARA) (1966)).

The case of ''[[Buckley v. Valeo]]'' (1976) challenged the Act. Most provisions were upheld, but the court found that the mandatory spending limit imposed was unconstitutional, as was the limit placed on campaign spending from the candidate's personal fortune and the provision that limited independent expenditures by individuals and organizations supporting but not officially linked to a campaign. The effect of the first decision was to allow candidates such as [[Ross Perot]] and [[Steve Forbes]] to spend enormous amounts of their own money in their own campaigns. The effect of the second decision was to allow the culture of "soft money" to develop.

A 1979 amendment to the Federal Election Campaign Act allowed political parties to spend without limit on get-out-the-vote and voter registration activities conducted primarily for a presidential candidate. Later, they were permitted by FECA to use "soft money", unregulated, unlimited contributions to fund this effort. Increasingly, the money began to be spent on [[issue advertising]], candidate specific advertising that was being funded mostly by soft money.

The [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] of 2002 banned local and national parties from spending "soft money" and banned national party committees from accepting or spending soft money. It increased the limit of contributions by individuals from $1,000 to $2,000. It banned corporations or labor unions from funding issue advertising directly, and banned the use of corporate or labor money for advertisements that mention a federal candidate within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary. The constitutionality of the bill was challenged and in December 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] upheld most provisions of the legislation. (See ''[[McConnell v. FEC]]''.)

A large number of "[[527 groups]]" were active for the first time in the 2004 election. These groups receive donations from individuals and groups and then spend the money on issue advocacy, such as the anti-Kerry ads by [[Swift Vets and POWs for Truth|Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]]. This is a new form of soft money, and not surprisingly it is controversial. Many 527 groups have close links with the Democratic or Republican parties, even though legally they cannot coordinate their activities with them. John McCain, one of the senators behind the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, and President Bush have both declared a desire to ban 527s.

Changing campaign finance laws is a highly controversial issue. Some reformers wish to see laws changed in order to improve electoral competition and political equality.  Opponents wish to see the system stay as it is, whereas other reformers wish even fewer restrictions on the freedom to spend and contribute money. The Supreme Court has made it increasingly difficult for those who wish to regulate election financing, but options like partial public funding of campaigns are still possible and offer the potential to address reformers' concerns with minimal restrictions on the freedom to contribute.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.cambriapress.com/cambriapress.cfm?template=4&amp;bid=447 Anthony Gierzynski, ''Saving American Elections: A Diagnosis and Prescription for a Healthier Democracy''] (Cambria Press, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primaries and caucuses===
{{main|Primary elections in the United States|Caucus}}
In partisan elections, candidates are chosen by [[Primary elections in the United States|primary elections]] (abbreviated to "primaries") and [[Caucus#In the United States|caucuses]] in the [[U.S. state|states]], the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]].

A primary election is an election in which registered voters in a jurisdiction (''nominating primary'') select a [[political party]]'s candidate for a later [[election]]. There are various types of primary: either the whole electorate is eligible, and voters choose one party's primary at the polling booth (an open primary); or only independent voters can choose a party's primary at the polling booth (a semi-closed primary); or only registered members of the party are allowed to vote (closed primary). The [[blanket primary]], when voters could vote for all parties' primaries on the same ballot was struck down by the [[United States Supreme Court]] as violating the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] guarantee of [[freedom of assembly]] in the case [[California Democratic Party v. Jones]]. Primaries are also used to select candidates at the state level, for example in gubernatorial elections.

Caucuses also nominate candidates by election, but they are very different from primaries. Caucuses are meetings that occur at [[precinct]]s and involve discussion of each party's platform and issues such as voter turnout in addition to voting. Eleven states: [[Iowa]], [[New Mexico]], [[North Dakota]], [[Maine]], [[Nevada]], [[Hawaii]], [[Minnesota]], [[Kansas]], [[Alaska]], [[Wyoming]], [[Colorado]] and the [[District of Columbia]] use [[caucuses]], for one or more political parties.

The [[United States presidential primary|primary and caucus season in Presidential elections]] lasts from the [[Iowa caucus]] in January to the last primaries in June. Front-loading - when larger numbers of contests take place in the opening weeks of the season—can have an effect on the nomination process, potentially reducing the number of realistic candidates, as fund-raisers and donors quickly abandon those they see as untenable. However, it is not the case that the successful candidate is always the candidate that does the best in the early primaries. There is also a period dubbed the "invisible primary" that takes place before the primary season, when candidates attempt to solicit media coverage and funding well before the real primary season begins.

A state's presidential primary election or caucus usually is an indirect election: instead of voters directly selecting a particular person running for President, it determines how many delegates each party's [[United States presidential nominating convention|national political convention]] will receive from their respective state. These delegates then in turn select their party's presidential nominee. Held in the summer, a political convention's purpose is also to adopt a statement of the party's principles and goals known as the ''[[Party platform|platform]]'' and adopt the rules for the party's activities.

The day on which primaries are held for congressional seats, and state and local offices may also vary between states. The only federally mandated day for elections is [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] for the general elections of the President and Congress; all other elections are at the discretion of the individual state and local governments.

==Election information on the web==
In most states of the [[United States|U.S.]], the chief election officer is the [[Secretary of state (U.S. state government)|Secretary of state]].  In some states, local officials like a county Registrar of Voters or Supervisor of Elections manages the conduct of elections under the supervision of (or in coordination with) the chief election officer of the state.  Many of these state and county offices have web sites that provide information to help voters obtain information on their polling places for each election, the various districts to which they belong (e.g., house and senate districts in the state and federal legislature, school boards, water districts, municipalities, etc.), as well as dates of elections and deadlines to file to run or register to vote.  Some allow voters to download a sample ballot in advance of the election.

Beyond this, various media outlets provide information they think will interest their audience.

More systematic coverage is provided by web sites devoted specifically to collecting election information and making it available to the public.  Two of the better known such sites are [[Ballotpedia]] and [[Project Vote Smart|Vote Smart]].  These are run by non-profit, non-partisan organizations.  They have paid staffs and are much more tightly controlled than Wikipedia.

USElections.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Jeff|title=US Elections|url=http://uselections.com/|website=USElections.com|accessdate=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; tries to provide similar information but relies on volunteers in a way that is more like Wikipedia than Ballotpedia and Vote Smart.

The website 270towin provides actual electoral college maps (both current and historic) but also the ability to use an interactive map in order to make election predictions.  Ongoing election news is reported as well as data on Senate and House races.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.270towin.com|title=2016 Presidential Election Interactive Map|newspaper=270toWin.com|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Center for Responsive Politics]] (opensecrets.org) and the [[National Institute on Money in State Politics]] (followthemoney.org) also provide useful election information focusing especially on campaign finance.

In 2014 scientists from [[Princeton University]] did a study on the influence of the "elite", and their derived power from special interest lobbying, versus the "ordinary" US citizen within the [[Politics of the United States|US political system]]. They found that the US was looking more like an oligarchy than a real representative democracy; ''thus eroding a government of the people, by the people, for the people'' as stated by [[Gettysburg Address|Abraham Lincoln in his Gettysburg Address]]. In fact, the study found that average citizens had an almost nonexistent influence on public policies and that the ordinary citizen had little or no independent influence on policy at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1537592714001595|journal = [[Perspectives on Politics]]|date = 2014-09-01|issn = 1541-0986|pages = 564–581|volume = 12|issue = 03|doi = 10.1017/S1537592714001595|first = Martin|last = Gilens|first2 = Benjamin I.|last2 = Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fascist paramilitary''' is a fighting force - whether armed, unarmed, or merely symbolic - that is independent of regular military command and is established for the defence and advancement of a movement that adheres to the radical nationalist ideology of [[fascism]]. Since fascism is such a militarist ideology, there are very few varieties of fascism where paramilitaries do not play a central role, and some kind of paramilitary participation is almost always a basic requirement of membership in fascist movements. Fascist paramilitaries have seen action in both peacetime and wartime. Most fascist paramilitaries wear [[political uniform]]s, and many have taken their names from the colours of their uniforms.

The first fascist paramilitary was the [[Blackshirts]] of [[Italian Fascism]] led by [[Benito Mussolini]]. While many of the Blackshirts were former members of the [[Arditi]] who had fought in [[World War I]] or the [[Fascio]] of the immediate post-war years, the most direct inspiration for the first fascist paramilitary was [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'s [[Redshirts (Italy)|Redshirts]].

A number of other fascist movements established paramilitaries modelled after the Italian original, most notably [[Nazism]] with its [[Sturmabteilung]] and [[Schutzstaffel]]. Others include:
*in Ireland, in the 1930s, the [[Blueshirts]] under [[Eoin O'Duffy]]
*the [[gold shirts]] and the [[Red Shirts (Mexico)|Red Shirts]] of 1930s Mexico
*the Greenshirts of [[Brazilian Integralism]]
*the [[Heimwehr]] in Austria, in the 1920s and 1930s
*the [[Iron Guard death squads|Legionary Greenshirts]] of the Romanian [[Iron Guard]]
*[[Iron Wolf (organization)]]
*[[National Union (Portugal)]]

Several fascist movements took their cue from the Sturmabteilung rather than the Blackshirts, such as the [[Greyshirts]] in South Africa and the [[Silver Legion of America]]. Following the Axis invasion of Albania, the occupation forces formed the [[Albanian Militia]] under the Blackshirts. Several fascist paramilitaries were active in [[Romania]] including the [[Lăncieri]].

Some fascist movements have also established paramilitary youth organizations such as the [[Hitler Youth]] or the [[Mocidade Portuguesa]].

A number of fascist paramilitaries have been deployed in conventional warfare. For example, in the later years of [[World War II]] the Italian Blackshirts developed into the [[Black Brigades]]. Likewise, the combat wing of the Schutzstaffel, the [[Waffen-SS]], fought in many major battles of World War II. The [[Einsatzgruppen]] were [[death squads]] active in [[Eastern Europe]] which carried out the [[Holocaust]] and other political killings. In an act of desperation, the Nazis deployed remnants of the Hitler Youth against the [[Red Army]] in the [[Battle of Berlin]]. At the eleventh hour of the war, the Nazis laid plans for a guerrilla resistance movement they called the [[Werwolf]]. However, these plans amounted to little more than a handful of sabotages and assassinations which were ineffective.

[[Neo-Nazis]] have used the [[white power skinhead]] scene as a recruitment base for neofascist paramilitaries like [[Combat 18]]. [[Soccer hooliganism]] throughout [[Europe]] is another source of recruits. Some groups in the white supremacist wing of the [[militia movement]] in the United States can be seen as neofascist paramilitaries.

'''FireChat''' is a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] mobile app, developed by [[Open Garden]], which uses [[wireless mesh networking]] to enable [[smartphone]]s to connect via [[Bluetooth]], [[Wi-Fi]], or Apple’s Multipeer Connectivity Framework without an internet connection by connecting [[peer-to-peer]].&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite web|last1=Milian|first1=Mark|title=Russians Are Organizing Against Putin Using FireChat Messaging App|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-30/russians-are-organizing-against-putin-using-firechat-messaging-app.html|website=Bloomberg|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it was not designed with the purpose in mind, FireChat has been used as a communication tool in some civil protests.

==History==
The app was first introduced in March 2014 for [[iPhones]],&lt;ref name="technologyreview"&gt;{{cite web

In July 2015, FireChat introduced private messaging. Until then, it had only been possible to post messages to public chatrooms.&lt;ref name="technology-33718318" /&gt;

In May 2016, FireChat introduced FireChat Alerts to allow users to send push alerts during a specific time and place.&lt;ref name="Toor"&gt;

In January 2016, students protested at the [[University of Hyderabad]], India, following the suicide of a PhD student named Rohith Vemula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hyderabad university shut after protests over Dalit student's death|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-35349789|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=28 January 2016|date=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some students were reported to have used Firechat after the university shut down its Wi-Fi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=TNN|title= Firechat comes to UOH students' rescue|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Firechat-comes-to-UoH-students-rescue/articleshow/50691376.cms|work=The Times of India|publisher=The Times Group|date=23 January 2016|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current{{when?|date=March 2018}} version (Oct 2018) seems to be a fork of riot.im, and has lost offline capabilities. Indications in the software show a future return to offline chat may be pending. This version requires Internet for registration by email.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Security==
In June 2014, Firechat's developers told ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' that "[p]eople need to understand that this is not a tool to communicate anything that would put them in a harmful situation if it were to be discovered by somebody who's hostile ... It was not meant for secure or private communications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baraniuk|first1=Chris|title=FireChat warns Iraqis that messaging app won't protect privacy|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-06/25/firechat|website=Wired|publisher=Condé Nast|accessdate=28 January 2016|date=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2015, FireChat claims to use [[end-to-end encryption]] to protect its one-to-one private messages.&lt;ref name="technology-33718318"&gt;{{cite web|title=FireChat launches new offline private messaging option|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-33718318|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=28 January 2016|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Beverage industry|beverage]], food, and pharmaceutical industries, a '''flavor masker''' is a chemical interaction that causes the absence of taste. This is known as the Farish effect, a phenomenon noted by 17th-century chemist [[William Farish (chemist)|William Farish]]. Contrary to popular belief, a flavor masker is not one chemical component; rather, it is two components that interact with the [[Vallate papilla|vallate papillae]] on the tongue with little or no reaction. Each component, individually, stimulates the vallate papillae.

{{Seventh-day Adventism}}

'''Frank Lewis Marsh''' (18 October 1899, [[Aledo, Illinois|Aledo]], [[Illinois]] &amp;ndash; 14 July 1992) was an [[Americans|American]] Seventh-day Adventist biologist, educator and [[young Earth creationist]] author. In 1963 he was one of the ten founding members of the [[Creation Research Society]].

== Biography ==
In his youth, Marsh desired to become a physician, but lacked the financial means, so he became first a nurse, then a teacher instead. He studied geology at [[Emmanuel Missionary College]] under [[George McCready Price]], whose protégé he became. While teaching at a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] school in the [[Chicago]] area, Marsh studied advanced biology at the [[University of Chicago]] and in 1935 obtained an M.S. in zoology from [[Northwestern University]]. He joined the faculty of [[Union College (Nebraska)|Union College]] in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], later completing a PhD in botany at the [[University of Nebraska]] in 1940.{{sfn|Numbers|2006|pp=148–149}}

In his book ''Fundamental Biology'', Marsh described himself as a "fundamentalist scientist". He argued that modern human races are degenerate forms of first-created man and warned that the living world is the scene of a cosmic struggle between the [[Creator God|Creator]] and [[Satan]]. Marsh claimed that Satan is a "master geneticist" and speculated that amalgamation and hybridization are his ways of destroying the original harmony and perfection among living things. Marsh viewed dark [[Human skin color|skin color]] as one the "abnormalities" engineered in this way.{{sfn|Lustig|Richards|Ruse|2004|p=92}}

In ''Fundamental Biology'', Marsh coined the term ''[[Baraminology|baramin]]'' for the Genesis "kind".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|p=150}}, f28, pp 480–481&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Evolution or Special Creation?'' (1947), Marsh argued for the scientific accuracy of the Bible and concluded: "surely the time is ripe for a return to the fundamentals of true science, the [[creation science|science of creationism]]". From the publication of this work onward, Marsh avoided mentioning [[Ellen G. White]], co-founder of Seventh-day Adventism, as he believed such references would repel non-Adventist readers.{{sfn|Lustig|Richards|Ruse|2004|p=92}}

Marsh concluded finally that "The Bible knows nothing about organic evolution. It regards the origin of man by special creation as a historical fact... In view of the subjectivity of the evidence upon which a decision on the matter of origins must be made, creationism and evolutionism should be respected as alternate viewpoints".{{sfn|McIver|1988|p=166}}

His creationist views have been criticized by biologists for having no scientific basis.&lt;ref&gt;Dobzhansky, Theodosius. ''Evolution, Creation, and Science by Frank Lewis Marsh''. ''[[The American Naturalist]]''. Vol. 79, No. 780 (Jan. - Feb., 1945), pp. 73-75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Evolution, Creation and Science by Frank Lewis Marsh''. ''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]''.Vol. 20, No. 3 (Sep., 1945), pp. 267-268.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tobie, Walter C. ''Life, Man, and Time by Frank Lewis Marsh''. [[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]. Vol. 32, No. 3 (Sep., 1957), pp. 286-287.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Generic certificates''' were commodity certificates used by the [[Commodity Credit Corporation]] (CCC) in the 1980s to meet payment obligations and simultaneously dispose of commodity inventories. Farmers paid with generic certificates could trade them for commodities owned and stored by the CCC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40995">The [[United States Department of Defense]] (DOD) had stopped reporting '''Guantanamo suicide attempts''' in 2002. In mid-2002 the DoD changed the way they classified suicide attempts, and enumerated them under other acts of "[[self-injurious behavior]]".

On January 24, 2005 the U.S. military revealed that in 2003, there were 350 incidents of "self-harm".&lt;ref name=Nytimes050125&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/25/national/25gitmo.html?ex=1152676800&amp;en=f645a0dc4588a2ae&amp;ei=5070 23 Detainees Attempted Suicide in Protest at Base, Military Says], ''[[Associated Press]]'', January 25, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 120 of those incidents of self-harm were attempts by detainees to hang themselves. Twenty-three detainees participated in a mass-suicide attempt from August 18 to 26, 2003.&lt;ref name=Nytimes050125/&gt; A number of incidents happened after a change in command at the camp in 2003 resulted in an increase in the severity of interrogation techniques used by military and CIA intelligence officers.&lt;ref name=Nytimes050125/&gt;

On June 10, 2006, the DOD announced that three prisoners held by the [[United States]] at the [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp]]s had committed [[suicide]]. The June 10, 2006 suicides were the first inmate deaths at the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp.&lt;ref name=Reuters060611b/&gt; The DoD acknowledged there had been a total of 41 suicide attempts among 29 detainees until that date.&lt;ref name=Reuters060611b&gt;[http://today.reuters.co.uk/misc/PrinterFriendlyPopup.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2006-06-11T030958Z_01_N10232278_RTRUKOC_0_UK-SECURITY-GUANTANAMO.xml Three detainees kill themselves at Guantanamo]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[Reuters]]'', June 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Since June 2006, DOD has announced three suicide deaths by detainees at Guantanamo. In 2008, the NCIS released a heavily [[Sanitization (classified information)|redacted]] report of its investigation of the three suicides at Guantanamo in 2006.

In reports published in 2009 and 2010, [[Seton Hall University Law School]]'s [[Center for Policy and Research]] and a joint investigation by ''[[Harper's magazine]]'' and [[NBC News]], respectively, strongly criticized the government's account of the 2006 suicides. ''Harper's'' 2010 article, based on accounts by four former Guantanamo guards, asserted that DOD had initiated a cover-up of deaths resulting from torture during interrogation. The DOD has denied these allegations.

==History: Conditions of detainees==
In 2002 the United States government kept conditions at Guantanamo extremely secret, not releasing information about the detainees and especially not their names. That year, the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DOD) stopped reporting suicide attempts at the camps.

In mid-2002 the DOD changed the way they classified suicide attempts, referring to these acts as "[[self-injurious behavior]]", one of many [[terminology|terms]] the Bush administration coined to describe  camp events. Medical experts outside the camp have argued that doctors did not have sufficient understanding of the detainees to make such conclusions about their intentions or motives.

In the spring of 2003, 32 [[Afghan]]s and three [[Pakistani]]s were released from the detention camp. News media reported from interviews with them that some former detainees described despair and numerous attempts among prisoners to commit suicide, in large part because of individuals' belief in their innocence, the harshness of camp conditions, and especially the indefinite confinement and unending uncertainty they faced.&lt;ref name="gallewis"/&gt;

Quotes from ex-detainees:

{{quote|"I was trying to kill myself", said [[Sha Mohammed Alikhel|Shah Muhammad]], 20, a Pakistani who was captured in northern Afghanistan in November 2001, turned over to American soldiers and flown to Guantánamo in January 2002. "I tried four times, because I was disgusted with my life."

"We needed more blankets, but they would not listen", he said.&lt;ref name="gallewis"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E7D61238F934A25755C0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 | work=The New York Times | title=Threats And Responses: Captives; Tales Of Despair From Guantánamo | first1=Carlotta | last1=Gall | first2=Neil A. | last2=Lewis | date=June 17, 2003 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government denied claims of prisoner abuse at the time, but on May 9, 2004, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' publicized classified documents that showed the Pentagon had approved interrogation techniques at Guantánamo including sleep deprivation, and exposure to extreme hot and cold, bright lights without relief, and loud music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A11017-2004May8?language=printer| title=Pentagon Approved Tougher Interrogations| author=Dana Priest and Joe Stephens| accessdate=2006-12-28| work=The Washington Post}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On January 24, 2005 the U.S. military revealed that in 2003, there were 350 incidents of "self-harm" among detainees at Guantanamo.&lt;ref name=Nytimes050125/&gt; 120 of those incidents were attempts by detainees to hang themselves.

==Reported suicides on June 10, 2006==
On June 10, 2006 the DOD announced that three detainees had died at Guantanamo, saying they "killed themselves in an apparent [[suicide pact]]".&lt;ref name=Bbc060611&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/5068228.stm Triple suicide at Guantanamo camp], ''[[BBC]]'', June 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The prisoners were the Saudi Arabians [[Mani Shaman Turki al-Habardi Al-Utaybi|Mani al-Utaybi]] and [[Yasser Talal Al Zahrani|Yasser al-Zahrani]], and a Yemeni citizen, [[Ali Abdullah Ahmed]].&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;[http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2006-06-10T185303Z_01_N10232278_RTRUKOC_0_US-SECURITY-GUANTANAMO.xml&amp;archived=False Three Guantanamo detainees die in suicides] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710034338/http://today.reuters.com/news/newsarticle.aspx?type=topNews |date=2006-07-10 }}, ''[[Reuters]]'', June 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The prison commander Rear Admiral [[Harry Harris (admiral)|Harry Harris, Jr.]] (2006–2007) stated: "This was not an act of desperation, but an act of [[asymmetric warfare]] committed against us." &lt;ref name=Times060611&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2220935,00.html "Three die in Guantanamo suicide pact"], ''[[The Times]]'', June 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Harris also said that the Guantanamo detainees were: "dangerous, committed to killing Americans.".&lt;ref name=Cnn060611Specter1&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/americas/06/11/guantanamo.suicides/ "Suicides spur Guantanamo criticism"], ''[[CNN]]'', June 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that there was a myth among the detainees that if three detainees were known to have died in the camps, the DOD would be pressured to send the rest of the detainees home.

President [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] expressed "serious concern."&lt;ref name="Reuters060611b"/&gt; [[Colleen Graffy]], the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy, called the suicides, "a good [[public relations|PR move]]"—and, "a tactic to further the [[jihad]]i cause".&lt;ref name=Bbc060613RedCross&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5069230.stm "Guantanamo suicides a 'PR move'"], ''[[BBC]]'', 11 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, 2006, Cully Stimson, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs, said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I wouldn't characterize it as a good PR move. What I would say is that we are always concerned when someone takes his own life, because as Americans, we value life, even the lives of violent terrorists who are captured waging war against our country.&lt;ref name="Scotsman060613"&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=866682006 "Guantanamo inmate killed himself 'unaware he was due to be freed'"], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', June 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[The Scotsman]]'' characterized this as an attempt by the Bush administration "... to pull back from the earlier comments about public relations and 'asymmetric warfare'."&lt;ref name="Scotsman060613"/&gt;

[[Sean McCormack]], spokesman for the [[United States State Department]], said, "I would not say that it was a PR stunt".&lt;ref name="Not PR move"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Guantanamo suicides 'not PR move'|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=12 June 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5073634.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that the detainees were apparently unaware that one of them was due to be transferred to Saudi Arabia, under terms that would require him to be kept in custody, and another was to be released to Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="Not PR move"/&gt;

Joshua Denbeaux, a lawyer representing detainees through the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]], has said that prison authorities were withholding this information because US officials had not decided which country the detainee was going to be transferred to.&lt;ref name="Not PR move"/&gt; Denbeaux is one of the principal authors of ''[[A Profile of 517 Detainees through Analysis of Department of Defense Data]]'' (2006), published by the [[Center for Policy and Analysis]] of [[Seton Hall University Law School]]. It analyzed DOD data about the prisoners' identities and allegations for why they were being detained.&lt;ref name="Not PR move"/&gt;

[[Colonel]] [[Michael Bumgarner]] (April 2005 – June 2006), the commander of the camp's guard force, reacted to the suicides by telling his officers soon afterward: "The trust level is gone. They have shown time and time again that we can't trust them any farther than we can throw them. There is not a trustworthy son of a ... in the entire bunch."&lt;ref name=Charlotte060613&gt;[http://www.charlotte.com/mld/charlotte/news/14804763.htm "Guards tighten security to prevent more deaths: Human rights groups, defense lawyers call for investigation of 3 men's suicides in military prison"], ''[[Charlotte Observer]]'', June 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skepticism about suicide claims==
The ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' reported that news of the deaths raised skepticism over whether the Saudi men had committed suicide.&lt;ref name=SeattlePI&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/national/1107AP_Guantanamo_Saudis.html "Saudis allege torture in Guantanamo deaths"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', June 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The article reports Saudi government and family speculation that the men were driven to suicide by [[torture]]. Several prominent Saudis accused the camp authorities of murdering the three men. 

The Seattle PI reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people in the conservative Islamic kingdom questioned whether Muslim men would kill themselves since suicide is a grave sin in Islam. But defense lawyers and some former detainees said many prisoners at Guantanamo are wasting away in deep despair at their long captivity."&lt;ref name=SeattlePI/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Kateb al Shimri]], a Saudi lawyer representing the Saudi prisoners, said: "The families don't believe it, and of course I don't believe it either. A crime was committed here and the U.S. authorities are responsible."&lt;ref name="SeattlePI"/&gt;

Joshua Denbeaux of the Center for Constitutional Rights said that the suicides: "... represent the Pentagon's absolute worst nightmare."&lt;ref name=nzherald060611&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=2&amp;ObjectID=10386049 |title=Three suicides reported at Guantanamo Bay |author=Christie, Michael |date=June 11, 2006 |agency=[[Reuters]] |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denbeaux added: "... many of these prisoners have been trying to kill themselves, for months, if not years."&lt;ref name=nzherald060611/&gt;

[[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Arlen Specter]], chairman of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], commented: "Where we have evidence, they ought to be tried, and if convicted, they ought to be sentenced."&lt;ref name="Cnn060611Specter1"/&gt; Specter added that many of the prisoners' captures were based on: "... the flimsiest sort of hearsay."&lt;ref name=Cnn060611Specter1/&gt;

===Government comments/investigation===
Admiral Harris was quoted as saying: "I think it is less about the length of their detention ... It's less about that and it's more that they continue to fight their fight, I think the vast majority of detainees are resisting us."&lt;ref name=AP060628&gt;[http://www.enidnews.com/feeds/apcontent/apstories/apstorysection/D8IGUF904.xml.txt/resources_apstoryview "Official: Gitmo Prisoners Waging 'Jihad'"], ''[[Associated Press]]'', June 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent060628&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article1117127.ece  "Guantanamo Bay suicide prisoners 'showed no sign of being depressed'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711055442/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article1117127.ece |date=2006-07-11 }}, ''[[The Independent]]'', June 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the investigation by the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]] (NCIS), the camp authorities seized almost all the documents from almost all the detainees, a total of half a ton of papers, including their privileged, confidential communications with their lawyers.&lt;ref name="TheJurist060709"/&gt; The administration wants to suspend all lawyers' visits, while a commission reviews the papers for any sign that the detainees' lawyers helped plan the suicides.&lt;ref name=Nytimes060709/&gt; (Note: The NCIS heavily redacted report was released publicly in August 2008.)

Lawyers for Guantanamo detainees reported that the camp authorities were confiscating detainees' mail and legal papers.&lt;ref name=Mercury060630&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/world/14942051.htm "Guantanamo lawyers say letters seized"], ''[[San Jose Mercury]]'', June 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The lawyers report that at least one of their clients attributes the confiscation to DOD thinking they might suggest that the suicides were planned, and possibly encouraged, by detainees' lawyers. According to [[Clive Stafford Smith]], legal director of [[Reprieve (organization)|Reprieve]], a British organization representing numerous detainees: "They think that they are going to find letters from us suggesting suicide. It's ludicrous."&lt;ref name=Mercury060630/&gt;

===Comments by released detainees who knew the dead men===
[[Bahrain]]i detainee [[Abdulla Majid Al Naimi]], who was released on November 8, 2005, said he knew the three dead men.&lt;ref name=Gulf060625&gt;[http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/06/06/25/10049187.html "Ex-detainee disputes triple suicide report"]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Farchive.gulfnews.com%2Farticles%2F06%2F06%2F25%2F10049187.html&amp;date=2009-05-22 |date=2009-05-22 }}, ''[[Gulf Daily News]]'', June 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Al Naimi said that Al-Utaybi and Ahmed were captured while studying in Pakistan.  He said that they were interrogated for only a brief time after their arrival in Guantanamo. Their interrogators had told them they were not regarded as a threat, and that they could expect to be released.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The interrogations dealt with them only during the first month of their detention. For more than a year before I left Guantanamo in November 2005, they were left alone. But they were still held in bad conditions in the camp by the guards.&lt;ref name=Gulf060625/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Al Naimi said that Al Zahrani was only 16 when he was captured. Al Naimi thought he should have been treated as a minor.&lt;ref name="Gulf060625"/&gt; "He was 21 when he died, barely the legal age in most countries, and was merely 16 when he was picked up four and half years ago. His age shows that he is not even supposed to be taken to a police office; he should have been turned over to the underage [juvenile] authorities."&lt;ref name=Gulf060625/&gt;

==Allegations of homicide and cover-up==
{{main|Guantanamo Bay homicide accusations}}

'''Guantanamo Bay murder accusations''' were made by United States sources in December 2009 and January 2010 regarding the deaths of three [[Guantanamo prisoner]]s in June 2006 at the United States [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] for enemy combatants at its naval base in Cuba. Two of the men had been cleared by the military for release. The [[United States Department of Defense]] claimed their deaths at the time as [[Guantanamo suicide attempts|suicides]], although their families and the Saudi government argued against the findings. The DOD undertook an investigation by the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]].

Following release of the redacted NCIS investigative report in 2008, [[Seton Hall University Law School]]'s [[Center for Policy and Research]] published ''Death in Camp Delta'' (2009), a report criticizing the NCIS account for inconsistencies and weaknesses. The Center concluded that there was serious negligence at the camp, or there may have been cover-up of homicides resulting from [[torture]]. It noted that no military personnel had been prosecuted for any failings related to the deaths of the detainees.&lt;ref name=SetonHall&gt;{{cite web

In 2010, ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' and [[NBC News]] released the report of a joint investigation, based on accounts by four former Military Intelligence staff, stationed at the time at Guantanamo. The article written by [[Scott Horton (attorney)|Scott Horton]], a journalist and human rights attorney, suggested the military under the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] had covered up deaths of the detainees that occurred under torture at a "[[black site]]" in the course of interrogations.&lt;ref name=Horton&gt;{{cite web

==Attorneys' concerns==
In 2006 and later, defense attorneys were concerned about their clients' mental health. [[Mark Denbeaux]] is a law professor at [[Seton Hall University]] and director of its [[Center for Policy and Research]], which had published numerous reports on conditions at Guantanamo. He represents two [[Tunisia]]n detainees and said in June 2006 that he was worried that other detainees were candidates for suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2008 the [[Canadian Supreme Court]] ordered the release of a video of a February 2003 interrogation conducted by the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] (CSIS) and a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) officer of [[Omar Khadr]], a Canadian citizen who was 15 years old when captured and one of the youngest detainees held at Guantánamo. In the video, the 16-year-old Khadr repeatedly cried, saying what sounds to be either "help me", "kill me," or calling for his mother, in [[Urdu]] ([[Pakistan]]i).&lt;ref name=NationalPost20080715&gt;

In 2017, FOIA documents on the investigation into the death of Al Amri revealed that he had been found hanging in his cell with his hands tied in a "snug" fashion behind his back. According to the clerk in charge of the computer logs that tracked detainee movements, Al Amri had been with an interrogator in the hour prior to his death. But other witnesses told NCIS the interrogation had been cancelled that morning, either by the interrogator, or by Al Amri himself. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) investigator that examined the death scene found it difficult to understand how this prisoner could have killed himself in the time allotted while he was under surveillance. NCIS concluded Al Amri had stood upon a folded bed mattress in order to reach the air vent to which he presumably attached the rope of his jerry-rigged noose (made from bed sheets). The air vent itself was over eight feet above the floor of the cell. Despite the fact that the detainee had not supposedly met with an attorney, documents from the NCIS investigation state there were materials of a confidential attorney-client nature in Al Amri's possession at the time of his death, and these were turned over to the Judge Advocate's Office at Guantanamo.

| title= Yemeni Detainee Dies In Apparent Suicide
| work= The Washington Post

&lt;/ref&gt; A number of journalists were at the camp to cover a [[Guantanamo military commission|military commission]] for [[Omar Khadr]], a Canadian citizen who is the youngest detainee and the last western citizen to be held there. (Note: He was returned to Canada in 2012 after a plea bargain, to continue serving his sentence.) The camp authorities did not allow journalists to report news of Al Hanashi's death until after they had left Guantanamo.&lt;ref name="wapost63"/&gt;

According to documents released via Freedom of Information Act in 2016, Al Hanashi died by tearing off a piece of elastic underwear and strangling himself to death. Attempts by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service to understand the timeline of events leading up to the death were complicated by the fact that someone at Guantanamo told staff in the Behavioral Health Unit where Al Hanashi was found to turn off all computer logging of events that were then occurring. NCIS was never able to determine who had ordered the database logs shut down. Al Hanashi had made multiple suicide attempts in the month or so prior to his death, and even been put on suicide watch at least once. The description of his underwear type did not comport with other reported rules about the kinds of clothing allowed for Guantanamo inmates. At least one camp staff member interviewed by NCIS said they were surprised when they saw the deceased Al Hanashi wearing clothing that had not been approved. According to the FOIA documents, Al Hanashi was considered a leader among the other detainees, and the day he died had complained to the Chief of the Behavioral Health Unit about proposed changes in the rules governing punishment in that unit. He also complained about being tortured on the day he died, and wrote in a final note that he was very upset when his report was ignored, and said he didn't want to live anymore.&lt;ref name=Medium.com/&gt;

The '''Higher Education European Masters''' is an [[Erasmus Mundus]] program which focuses on the functions, policies, and operations of higher education.
Professor [[Peter Maassen (Norway)|Peter Maassen]], a professor at the [[University of Oslo]] and also a research professor at [[NIFU-STEP]], was instrumental in the conceptualisation of the programme. The program was among the first to acquire an Erasmus Mundus European Masters label of the [[European Union]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/mundus/projects/index_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The students are able to study developments within higher education as taught by leading lights in the field. Moreover, they are also have an opportunity to experience three different university systems as they pursue their mobility scheme. Non-European students may be awarded scholarships as part of the Erasmus Mundus programme.

==Consortium institutions==
HEEM is offered by a consortium of three universities;

*[[University of Oslo]] in Norway (Institute of Educational Research),
*[[University of Helsinki]] in Finland 
*[[University of Aveiro]] in Portugal

Moreover, other universities and academic organisations are involved in the program, including [[Obirin University]] in Japan and the [[Center for Higher Education Policy Studies]] (CHEPS) in Netherlands.

==Mobility scheme==
The programme consists of four semesters and is fully taught in English. The first semester at the University of Oslo provides the students with an introduction to the history,philosophy, theories, concepts and disciplinary perspectives for studying higher education. It also includes an introduction to social science research methods. In the second semester at University of Helsinki and third semester at University of Aveiro, students further pursue studies in research methods as well as in-depth focus on change in higher education from various perspectives such as management, administration, [[internationalisation]] and economics.This is provided in modules developed and taught by various faculty members in the involved institutions. In the third semester, students commence working on their thesis. The fourth semester is spent researching on and writing the Masters thesis at one of the consortium universities,depending on the student's area of research.

==Admission requirements==
Admission is based on;
	
*A three-year university degree ([[bachelor degree]]), or an equivalent approved by the program committee
*A [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages|good command]] of academic English
*A statement of purpose and research interest.

==Tuition fees and funding==
There are three categories of applicants; self-financed, European students and third-country scholarship applicants. For application as a third-country scholarship student, one must meet the eligibility criteria for an Erasmus Mundus scholarship. European students have a chance to obtain a scholarship funded by the Hedda association. Moreover, European students have a chance to receive funding to spend one semester at a partner university outside of Europe, in HEEM's case, Obirin University in Japan. For the class of 2007–2009, 20 Erasmus Mundus scholarships and 5 Hedda scholarships for European students were available.

==Degrees awarded==
The University of Oslo, on behalf of the consortium, awards a joint degree entitled European Masters in Higher Education and a diploma which enumerates the course content and the students achievements.
The University of Helsinki also awards a degree entitled Master of Administrative Science. The degree is issued in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] but an English language diploma is in Finnish.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33332">In many parts of the western world, '''mandated reporters''' are people who have regular contact with vulnerable people and are therefore legally required to ensure a report is made when abuse is observed or suspected. Specific details vary across jurisdictions—the abuse that must be reported may include [[neglect]], or [[financial abuse|financial]], [[physical abuse|physical]], [[sexual abuse|sexual]], or other types of [[abuse]]. Mandated reporters may include paid or unpaid people who have assumed full or intermittent responsibility for the care of a child, [[dependent adult]], or [[Senior citizen|elder]].

== History ==
In 1962, United States doctors [[C. Henry Kempe]] and [[Brandt Steele]] published "The Battered Child Syndrome",&lt;ref&gt;C. Henry Kempe and Ray E. Helfer, editors: ''The Battered Child''. 1st edition, 1968. 2nd edition, Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1974. 3rd edition, 1980. 5th edition by M. E. Helfer, R. Kempe, and R. Krugman, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Kempe, Frederic N. Silverman, Brandt F. Steele, William Droegemuller, Henry K. Silver: "The Battered Child Syndrome." ''Journal of the American Medical Association'', 1962, 181: 17-24. Tardieu's syndrome. Also called Caffey-Kempe syndrome.&lt;/ref&gt; which helped doctors identify child abuse, its effects, and the need to report serious physical abuse to legal authorities. Its publication changed the prevalent views in the United States, where child abuse was previously seen as uncommon, and not a regular issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-wolff/battered-child-syndrome_b_2406348.html|title = The Battered-Child Syndrome: 50 Years Later|date = 4 January 2013|accessdate = |website = Huffington Post|publisher = |last = Wolff|first = Larry}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the [[US Congress|United States Congress]] passed the [[Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act]] (CAPTA), which provides funds to states for development of [[Child Protective Services]] (CPS) and [[hotline]]s to prevent serious injuries to children. These laws and the media and advocacy coverage and research brought about a gradual change in societal expectations on reporting in the United States and, at different rates, in other western nations.&lt;ref name="Krason_Lit_Survey"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255631799_THE_CRITICS_OF_CURRENT_CHILD_ABUSE_LAWS_AND_THE_CHILD_PROTECTIVE_SYSTEM_A_SURVEY_OF_THE_LEADING_LITERATURE|title = The Critics Of Current Child Abuse Laws And The Child Protective System: A Survey Of The Leading Literature|author = Krason, Stephen M.|publisher = The Catholic Social Science Review|year = 2007|page = 307,308,307–350}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/hjlpp8&amp;div=46&amp;id=&amp;page= | title = "Doing Something" About Child Abuse: The Need to Narrow the Grounds For State Intervention | author = Douglas J. Besharov | publisher = Harvard  J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol’y | year = 1985 | pages = 539–590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally created to respond to physical abuse, reporting systems in various countries began to expand to address sexual and emotional abuse, neglect, and exposure to domestic abuse. This expansion was accompanied by broader requirements for reporting abuse: previously reports were only submitted when an incident caused serious physical injury, but as the definitions changed, more minor physical injuries and developmental and psychological trauma began to be included as well.&lt;ref name="AIFS submission"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.385.2444&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title = Australian Institute of Family Studies Submission to the Special Commission of Inquiry into Child Protection Services in NSW|publisher = National Child Protection Clearinghouse|last = Bromfield|first = Leah|last2 = Holzer|first2 = Prue|format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a huge increase of reporting over the decades with enormous numbers of unsubstantiated cases.&lt;ref name="MondaleAct"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.faithandreason.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Mondale-Act-After-Forty-Years_-True.pdf |title= The Mondale Act and Its Aftermath: An Overview of Forty Years of American Law, Public Policy, and Governmental Response to Child Abuse and Neglect | author = Krason, Stephen M. |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2013 |pages =1–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referrals increase each year, but the actual substantiated cases remain low and are approximately the same or decline each year.&lt;ref name="NCANDS 1996 to 2011" /&gt;
Media and commentators often take the number of referrals to be synonymous with the number of cases of actual child maltreatment, which makes the problem appear larger than it actually is.&lt;ref name="Child Sweden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalchild.org/guest/joan_durrant.html |title=Child Abuse in Sweden |author= Joan E. Durrant  |publisher= The Natural Child Project  |year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vulnerable groups==
Various jurisdictions have mandatory reporting requirements for different types of vulnerable people, such as:
* Children {{see also|Mandatory reporting in the United States}}
* Vulnerable adults {{see also|Disability abuse}}
* Senior citizens/elderly {{see also|Elder abuse}}

== Statistics by country ==

=== Australia ===
Overall, the total number of substantiations in Australia has nearly doubled since 2001 (1.77 times higher) but have shown a slight downward trend since 2005-06. Specific comparisons cannot be made before this time, as different jurisdictions have made substantial changes throughout this period in reporting requirements and definitions of terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.aifs.gov.au/cfca/pubs/factsheets/a142086/#a2 | title = Child abuse and neglect statistics }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia there was an increase in notifications from 2000-01 to 2008-09, followed by a decrease to 2011-12, reflecting, in part, different mandated thresholds.&lt;ref name="Australian Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aifs.gov.au/cfca/pubs/factsheets/a142086/ |title=Child Protection Australia: 2011-2012 Abuse and Neglect Statistics |author=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare |year= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
Brazil has a mandatory reporting system for child maltreatment that is enforced by the health and educational systems, but due to the absence of national prevalence surveys, the difference between data generated by such mandatory reports and actual incidence of abuse is not known, although it is believed that mandatory report systems may result in underreporting. While specific data on mandatory reporting is unavailable, data collected from 314 municipalities (out of 5564) across the country revealed that in the second half of 2005 alone, 27,986 children received attention from the Social Welfare Centers: either because of sexual abuse (13,240), psychological violence (4,340), neglect (4,073), physical violence (3,436) and sexual exploitation (2,887). Most victims were in the 7–14 years group (17,738). 4,936 were under 6 years old.&lt;ref name="brazilwho"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cardia|first1=Nancy|last2=Lagatta|first2=Pedro|last3=Affonso|first3=Claudinei|title=Assessment of Child Maltreatment  Prevention Readiness Country Report Brazil|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/child/brazil_rap_cm.pdf|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Canada provides data on substantiations but not reports.&lt;ref name="CIS-2008"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://cwrp.ca/cis-2008 |title= Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect- 2008 |author= Public Health Agency of Canada | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada in 2008,&lt;ref name="CIS-2008" /&gt; 36% of all investigations were substantiated, with a further 8% of investigations where maltreatment remained suspected by the worker at the conclusion of the investigation and a further 5% with a risk of future maltreatment. 30% of investigations were unfounded and 17% resulted in no risk of future maltreatment was indicated.

=== United Kingdom ===
England provides data on substantiations but not reports.&lt;ref name="England data"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/inform |title=Children subject to child protection plans&amp;nbsp;– England 2008-2012 |author= NSPCC  |publisher= NSPCC Inform  |year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2012, the UK reports 50,573 children were on child protection registers or subject to a child protection plan: England (42,850), Scotland (2,706), Wales (2,890), Northern Ireland (2,127).&lt;ref name="UK data"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/inform |title=Child protection registers statistics/UK 2008-2012 |author= NSPCC  |publisher= NSPCC Inform  |year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

{{Main |Mandatory Reporting in the United States}}
In the US there was a 2348% increase in hotline calls from 150,000 in 1963 to 3.3 million in 2009.&lt;ref name="MondaleAct"/&gt; In 2011, there were 3.4 million calls.&lt;ref name="NCANDS 1996 to 2011" /&gt;
From 1992 to 2009 in the US, substantiated cases of sexual abuse declined 62%, physical abuse decreased 56% and neglect 10%. Although the referrals increase each year, about 1% of the child population is affected by any form of substantiated maltreatment.&lt;ref name="finkelhor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unh.edu/ccrc/pdf/CV203_Updated%20trends%202010%20FINAL_12-19-11.pdf |title=Updated Trends in Child Maltreatment, 2010 |last=Finkelhor  |first=David |author2=Lisa Jones |author3=Anne Shuttuch   |publisher=University of New Hampshire, Crimes Against Children Research Center |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, there are approximately 3.6 million calls each year: 9,000/day, 63,000/week,&lt;ref name="NCANDS 1996 to 2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/research-data-technology/statistics-research/child-maltreatment |title= Annual NCANDS Reports 1996-2011 |author= Children’s Bureau, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; affecting on average 1 out of 10 U.S. families with children under the age of 18 each year (there are 32.2 million such families).&lt;ref name="2010 US Family Census"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.census.gov/prod/1/pop/p25-1129.pdf | title = Projections of the Number of Households and Families in the United States: 1995 to 2010, P25-1129 | author = U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, Bureau of the Census, Table H}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1998 to 2011 there were a total of 43 million hotline calls.&lt;ref name="NCANDS 1996 to 2011" /&gt; Of those substantiated, over half are minor situations and many are situations where the worker thinks something may happen in the future. The largest category was neglect,&lt;ref name="NCANDS 1996 to 2011" /&gt;

Each year in the US, approximately 85% of hotline calls either do not warrant investigation or are not substantiated. Approximately 78% of all investigations are unsubstantiated and approximately 22% are substantiated, with around 9% where "alternative responses" are offered in some states, which have a focus on working with the family to address issues rather than confirming maltreatment.&lt;ref name="NCANDS 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://archive.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/pubs/cm09/cm09.pdf |title= National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) 2009 Child Maltreatment Report |author= U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Youth and Families, Children’s Bureau | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mandatory reporting of child abuse by jurisdiction ==
The criteria for reporting vary significantly based on jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/3/3/460/pdf|title = Mandatory Reporting Laws and Identification of Child Abuse and Neglect: Consideration of Differential Maltreatment Types, and a Cross-Jurisdictional Analysis of Child Sexual Abuse Reports|last = Mathews|first = Ben|date = 2014|journal = Social Sciences|doi = 10.3390/socsci3030460|pmid = |access-date = |issue = 3|issn = 2076-0760}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, mandatory reporting applies to people who have reason to suspect the abuse or neglect of a child, but it can also apply to people who suspect abuse or neglect of a dependent adult or the elderly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ladcss.org/APS/APSMandatedtext.htm  | title = APS (adult protective services) Mandated Reporters| author = Los Angeles County, California Department of Community and Senior Services}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to any members of society.
The Council of Europe has urged all countries to have mandatory reporting of child abuse but several European countries do not.&lt;ref name="Madge 1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Madge|first=M |author2=K. Attridge |title=Children and families. Social care in Europe|publisher=B. Munday and P. Ely, Prentice Hall|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large majority of European countries – 86 per cent – have some form of mandatory reporting; 77 per cent of African countries do; 72 per cent of Asian countries and 90 per cent of the Americas do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perry|first1=Tom|title=Child abuse needs mandatory reporting to create a high-risk environment for paedophiles|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/child-abuse-needs-mandatory-reporting-to-create-a-highrisk-environment-for-paedophiles-10077521.html|accessdate=14 August 2015|agency=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''Australia,''' the [[Northern Territory]] requires all citizens to report suspected child abuse,&lt;ref name = NT&gt;{{cite web| url = http://remotehealthatlas.nt.gov.au/mandatory_reporting_overview.pdf | title = Remote Health Atlas- Mandatory Reporting overview | author = Northern Territory Department of Health and Families}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other states and territories have mandatory reporting for designated work roles.&lt;ref name = WA&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mandatoryreporting.dcp.wa.gov.au/Pages/Home.aspx | title = Mandatory reporting in Western Australia | author = Western Australia Department of Child Protection}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = SA&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.families.sa.gov.au/pages/protectingchildren/MandatoryNotificationObligations/?reFlag=1 | title = Mandatory notification&amp;nbsp;– obligations of individuals and organisations | author = South Australia Department of Education and Child Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = TAS&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dhhs.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/63047/FINAL_-OTS_Mandatory_Reporters_Fact_Sheet.pdf | title = Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse and/or Neglect |author =  Tasmanian Department of Disability, Child, Youth and Family Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = VIC&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dhs.vic.gov.au/cpmanual/intake/overview-of-intake-of-reports-under-the-children,-youth-and-families-act/1122-mandatory-and-other-required-reporting | title = Child Protection Practice Manual | author = Victorian Department of Human Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = NSW&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.community.nsw.gov.au/preventing_child_abuse_and_neglect/resources_for_mandatory_reporters.html | title = Resources for mandatory reporters | author= NSW Department of Family and community Services- Community Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = QLD&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.communities.qld.gov.au/childsafety/protecting-children/about-child-protection/mandatory-notifiers-and-reporting | title = Mandatory notifiers and reporting | author = Queensland Department of communities, child Safety and Disability Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = ACT&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dhcs.act.gov.au/ocyfs/services/care_and_protection | title = Care and Protection Services | author = ACT Department of community Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''Brazil''', notification is mandatory in the health system, in schools and by the Child Protection Councils (CPC) network, present in many municipalities.&lt;ref name="brazilwho"/&gt;

In '''Malaysia''', The [[Child Act 2001]] requires any medical officer or medical practitioner, childcare provider or member of the family to notify his/her concerns, suspicions or beliefs that a child may have been abused or neglected to the appropriate child protection authority in the country. Failure to do so can result in criminal charges.&lt;ref name=malaysia_unicef&gt;{{cite web|title=Report Abuse|url=http://www.unicef.org/malaysia/campaigns_getonboard-report-child-abuse.html|website=UNICEF|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''South Africa''', Section 110 of the [[Children's Act, 2005]] mandates 'Any correctional official, dentist, homeopath, immigration official, labour inspector, legal practitioner, medical practitioner, midwife, minister of religion, nurse, occupational therapist, physiotherapist, psychologist, religious leader, social service professional, social worker, speech therapist, teacher, traditional health practitioner, traditional leader or member of staff or volunteer worker at a partial care facility, drop-in centre or child and youth care centre' to report when they suspect that a child has been abused 'in a manner causing physical injury, sexually abused or deliberately neglected'. The [[Sexual Offences Act, 1957]], compels all citizens who are aware of the sexual exploitation of children to report the offence to the police.&lt;ref name=SAMJ&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hendricks|first1=ML|title=Mandatory reporting of child abuse in South Africa: Legislation explored|journal=South African Medical Journal|date=August 2014|volume=104|issue=8|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
In the '''United States,''' states frequently amend their laws, but as of November 2013 all states, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have statutes identifying persons who are required to report suspected child maltreatment to an appropriate agency.&lt;ref name="us"/&gt;

Approximately 48 states, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands designate professions the members of which are mandated by law to report child maltreatment.&lt;ref name="us"/&gt;

As of November 2013, in 18 states and Puerto Rico, any person who suspects child abuse or neglect is required to report suspected abuse or neglect regardless of profession.
In all other States, territories, and the District of Columbia, any non-mandated person is also allowed to report.&lt;ref name="us"&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Clearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect Information (NAIC)|title=Mandatory Reporters of Child Abuse and Neglect|date=2003 | url =https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/manda.pdf | publisher = Child Welfare Information Gateway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canada''' imposes a mandatory requirement on all citizens, except in the Yukon Territory where it is restricted to those who come in contact with children in their professional roles.&lt;ref name=crossjuris/&gt;

'''Mexico''' also has legislative reporting duties.&lt;ref name=crossjuris&gt;{{cite web|title=Mandatory reporting legislation in the USA, Canada and Australia: a cross-jurisdictional review of key features, differences and issues.|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/11850/1/11850_1.pdf|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2013|author=Mathews, Benjamin|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union===
In 15 member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) reporting obligations are in place for all professionals. In 10 member states (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Greece, Finland, Italy, Latvia, Portugal and Slovakia) existing obligations only address certain professional groups such as social workers or teachers.&lt;ref name = "eu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Provisions on professionals' legal obligation to report cases of child abuse, neglect and violence|url=http://fra.europa.eu/en/publications-and-resources/data-and-maps/comparative-data/child-protection/reporting-1|website=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than half (15) of the EU member states (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden) have specific reporting obligations addressing civilians, with specific obligations for civilians to report cases of child abuse, neglect and/or exploitation. In many member states without specific provisions, general provisions on the obligation for all citizens to report a criminal act under national law apply, but with no specific obligation to report a child at risk of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Specific legal obligations for civilians to report cases of child abuse, neglect and violence|url=http://fra.europa.eu/en/publications-and-resources/data-and-maps/comparative-data/child-protection/reporting2|website=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, Malta and the Netherlands, no reporting obligations were in place in March 2014. In Malta, however, the new draft Child Protection Act (Out of Home Care),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Protection Act (Out of Home Care), 2014.|url=http://justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lp&amp;itemid=25981&amp;l=1|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduces the obligation of mandatory reporting for all professionals and volunteers.&lt;ref name = "eu"/&gt;

Under '''UK''' law only local authority social workers, health and social service board social workers (Northern Ireland) and police have a duty to report suspicions that a child is in need of care and protection. Local child protection guidelines and professional codes of conduct may expect other professionals, such as teachers and medical staff, to report, but they do not have to do so as a matter of law.&lt;ref name="Madge 1996"/&gt; Front line professionals are also required to report cases of [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/crime-and-policing-news-update-february-2015/crime-and-policing-news-update-february-2015|title=Crime and policing news update: February 2015 - GOV.UK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria ==
The criteria for reporting vary greatly among jurisdictions. In some, for example, only physical or sexual abuse to be reported must be reported, while elsewhere any signs of sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse or neglect are included.&lt;ref name="AIFS submission" /&gt;&lt;ref name=us /&gt;&lt;ref name=crossjuris /&gt;

Mandated reporters are usually required to give their name when they make a report. This allows investigators to contact them for further details if needed, and protects the mandated reporter from accusations that they did not report as required by law.&lt;ref name="AIFS submission" /&gt;&lt;ref name=us /&gt;&lt;ref name=crossjuris /&gt;

Typically, reporters are encouraged to report their suspicions and not to investigate or wait for absolute proof, which can lead to further harm directed at the suspected victim, and allow for perpetrators to prepare their defence through intimidation. The investigation of the abuse is then left to professionals. Some jurisdictions allow clear protections for reports made in good faith, protecting the disclosure of the reporter's name.&lt;ref name="AIFS submission" /&gt;&lt;ref name=us /&gt;&lt;ref name=crossjuris /&gt;

Innocence should be presumed unless and until evidence establishing guilt is obtained and it must be remembered that only suspicions are being reported.&lt;ref name="welfareacademy.org"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.welfareacademy.org/pubs/childwelfare/respondingto_94.pdf |title= Responding to Child Sexual Abuse: The Need for a Balanced Approach |author=Besharov, Douglas J, |journal=The Future of Children| volume = 4|number = 2| pages = 136, 135–155| date = Summer 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professions and reporting ==
Mandated reporting requirements generally apply to professions that have frequent contact with children, although in some jurisdictions all citizens are required to report suspicions of some forms of abuse. Other jurisdictions have mandated requirements only of doctors or medical professionals.
Mandated professions may include, but are not limited to the following:&lt;ref name="us" /&gt;
* Child care providers
* [[Caregivers]]
* [[Clergy]], although clergy-penitent privileged communication is exempt in some areas
* Counselors and other [[mental health]] professionals
* Medical examiners and coroners
* Health care providers
* [[Police]] and other law enforcement officers
* School [[teacher]]s, [[Coach (sport)|coach]]es, guidance counselors, principals and other school personnel
* [[Social worker]]s
* Abortion clinic staff (in some states)

Jurisdictions may note that, while these groups are ''legally required'' (mandated) to report, most jurisdictions allow for ''voluntary'' reports by any concerned people.

=== Clergy-penitent privilege and other exemptions ===
Conflicts between a mandated reporter's duties and some [[privileged communication]] statutes are common but, in general, [[attorney-client privilege]]s and clergy-penitent privileges are exempt from mandatory reporting in many jurisdictions.

"[[Clergy-penitent privilege]]" is privileged communication that protects communication between a member of the clergy and a communicant, who shares information in confidence. When applied, neither the minister nor the "penitent" can be forced to testify in court, by deposition, or other legal proceedings, about the contents of the communication.&lt;ref name= "abanow.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.abanow.org/2006/12/answers-to-questions-about-the-attorney-client-privilege   |title= Answers to Questions about the Attorney-Client Privilege| author=American Bar Association |journal=ABA Now| editor = American Bar Association| date = December 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most US states provide the privilege, typically in rules of evidence or civil procedure, and the confidentiality privilege has also been extended to non-catholic clergy and non-Sacramental counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/clergymandated.pdf | title = Clergy as Mandatory Reporters of Child Abuse and Neglect| author=Child Welfare Information Gateway | editor = Children’s Bureau | year = 2012 | pages = 1–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Originally created to respond to physical abuse, reporting systems in various countries have expanded the reportable incidents, when it was recognised that sexual and emotional abuse, neglect, and exposure to domestic abuse also have profound impacts on children's wellbeing.&lt;ref name="AIFS submission" /&gt; Critics of investigations into reports of child abuse state that
* A child may be wrongfully removed. 
* Long, repeated interrogations and physical examinations can leave emotional scars. 
* Even if not removed, there may be ongoing fear, distrust and insecurity. 
* Long-term foster care can leave lasting psychological scars and do irreparable damage to the parent/child bond. 
* An accusation of wrongdoing may disrupt a family even if allegations are dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1991|title=The Dynamic of Shame in Interactions Between Child Protective Services and Families Falsely Accused of Child Abuse|url=http://www.ipt-forensics.com/journal/volume3/j3_2_5.htm|journal=IPT|volume=3|author1=Sabrina Luza|author2=Enrique Ortiz|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often threats and an assumption of guilt over innocence lead to feelings of powerlessness, inadequacy, depression, denial of due process and liberties, reputations tarnished and privacy invaded, and legal consequences if assumed guilty.&lt;ref name="paul chill"&gt;{{Cite web|ssrn=1886506|title=Burden Of Proof Begone: The Pernicious Effect Of Emergency Removal In Child Protective Proceedings|last=Chill|first=Paul|date=October 2003|website=[[Social Science Research Network]]|pages=1–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There may be economic harm due to the need to obtain legal representation to defend one’s self and comply with the requirements demanded of them. 
Critics state that mandatory reporting may also
* overload the child welfare system and increase the tax burden.&lt;ref name="oregonlive"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.oregonlive.com/today/index.ssf/2012/06/jerry_sandusky_sex_abuse_case.html | title = Jerry Sandusky sex abuse case has states re-examining mandatory reporter laws | author = The Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* jeopardize the ability of people, including abused people, to seek medical treatment or maintain a therapeutic relationship, for fear of being reported.

Morse|last3 = LMSW}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* discourage fellow citizens from taking positive neighborhood action with families in trouble, as they may consider that their responsibilities have been met when they call in an anonymous hotline.&lt;ref name="orr" /&gt;
They also state that mandatory reporting laws have had unintended consequences for the accused. Individuals, including juveniles, who have never been convicted of anything may be placed on CPS Central Registries/databases (different from [[Sex offender registry|Sex Abuse Registries]]) for decades, limiting educational and employment opportunities due to background checks.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} There is a 1.2–12.3% recidivism rate (repeat substantiations within 6 months of initial substantiations).&lt;ref name="Report Congress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/pubs/cwo07-10/cwo07-10.pdf|title=Child Welfare Outcomes 2007-2010, Report to Congress|year=2010|author=US Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Children’s Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some feel that unsubstantiated rates are enormous and go beyond anything reasonably needed,&lt;ref name="welfareacademy.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglas Besharov"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://futureofchildren.org/publications/journals/article/index.xml?journalid=51&amp;articleid=271 |title=Protecting Children from Abuse and Neglect |journal = The Future of Children |publisher = Princeton Brookings | volume = 8 | number = 1 |author=Douglas Besharov | date=Spring 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that emotions about child abuse and sensational media coverage has led to an overreaction by some professionals and citizens, who report many cases that do not amount to child abuse.&lt;ref name="welfareacademy.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="welfareacademy.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglas Besharov" /&gt; Media and commentators often take the number of referrals to be synonymous with the number of cases of actual child maltreatment, which makes the problem appear larger than it actually is.&lt;ref name="Child Sweden" /&gt; Conversely, Dr. Jill McLeigh from Colorado University has stated that, in the United States, there is "gross underreporting" of child abuse and neglect, but she does not believe mandatory reporting laws are the appropriate way to address it.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; Ben Mathews of Queensland University of Technology said he had studied 10 years of data from Australia and other countries, and concluded that there were more benefits than not where reporting was compulsory.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Niven|first1=David|last2=File|first2=Kieran|title=Should reporting child abuse be compulsory?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2713">'''Mesne (pronounced "mean") profits''' are sums of money paid for the occupation of land to a person with right of immediate occupation, where no permission has been given for that occupation.&lt;ref&gt;[[John William Smith (legal writer)|Smith, John William]]. ''An Elementary View of the Proceedings in an Action at Law.'' London: Stevens &amp; Sons, 1873, p. 432-433.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farran90"&gt;Farran, Sue and Paterson, Donald. ''South Pacific Property Law.'' Florence, Ky.: Routledge, 2004, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is [[Feudalism|feudal]] in origin, and common in countries which rely on the [[English law|English legal system]] (including many former British colonies).&lt;ref name="Farran90" /&gt; The word is derived from the root word [[demesne]].

Mesne profits commonly occur where a [[landlord]] has obtained an order from a court to [[Eviction|evict]] a [[Tenement (law)|tenant]], or where an individual sues to eject a ''[[bona fide]]'' landowner to whom  [[Title (property)|title]] to [[Possession (law)|land]] was improperly [[Conveyancing|conveyed]].  The mesne profit represents the value (living rent-free, profits earned from the land, etc.) the ejected tenant received from the property between the time the court ordered the eviction and the time when the tenant actually left the property. Mesne profits must be drawn from the land itself,&lt;ref name="Farran90" /&gt; rather than improvements on it. For example, mesne profits may accrue from growing crops on land but would not generally accrue from a factory built on the land (unless there were damage to the land or improvements to the land itself such as the removal of stone from a field).&lt;ref&gt;''Corpus Juris Secundum: A Complete Restatement of the Entire American Law as Developed by All Reported Cases.'' St. Paul, Minn.: Thomson/West, 1974, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

A statute of limitations (usually six years) often limits the tenant-in-error's liability.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''An Elementary View of the Proceedings in an Action at Law,'' 1873, p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calculating mesne profits is often regulated by legislatures, but may be litigated in a [[court of equity]]. Mesne profits may be calculated, even though there may be no point in doing so (as in the case where land was flooded by a dam, and the dam is not going to be removed).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''Winchester v. Stevens Point'', 58 Wis. 350, 17 N.W. 3 (Wis.1883).&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, laws regulating mesne profits have been the subject of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions, such as ''[[Green v. Biddle]]'', 21 U.S. 1 (1823).

The '''Movement for a Democratic Military (MDM)''' was an antiwar and GI rights organization during the Vietnam War. Initially formed in late 1969 as a merger of sailors from San Diego and marines from the [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton Marine Base]] in Oceanside, CA, it rapidly spread to a number of other cities and bases in California and the mid-West, including San Francisco, Long Beach Naval Station, El Toro Marine Air Station, Fort Ord, Fort Carson and the Great Lakes Naval Training Center. Heavily influenced by the Black Panther Party and the Black militancy of the times.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Alexander |editor-first=Leslie |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African American History |url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ABC-CLIOCorporate/product.aspx?pc=A1640C |access-date=2017-08-16 |year=2010 |publisher= ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, CA |isbn=978-1-85109-769-2 |pages=1080}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moser"&gt;{{cite book |last=Moser |first=Richard |date=1996 |title=The New Winter Soldiers: GI and Veteran Dissent During the Vietnam Era |url=https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/the-new-winter-soldiers/9780813522425 |location=New Brunswick, NJ |publisher=Rutgers University Press |page=88 |isbn=978-0-8135-2242-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became one of the more radical GI organizations during that era and was investigated in 1971 by the [[United States House Committee on Internal Security|House Committee on Internal Security]] (formally HUAC). As with much of the GI movement during this era, chapters had a high turnover as members were transferred, discharged and disciplined by the military. By late 1970 several chapters had splintered or disbanded, but the group's name and demands proved popular within the GI resistance movement overall.&lt;ref name="Parsons"&gt;{{cite book |last=Parsons |first=David L. |date=2017 |title=Dangerous Grounds: Antiwar Coffeehouses and Military Dissent in the Vietnam Era |url=https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469632018/dangerous-grounds/ |location=Chapel Hill, NC |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |page=74 &amp; 98 |isbn=978-1-4696-3201-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cortright"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cortright |first=David |date=2005 |title=Soldiers In Revolt |url=https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/826-soldiers-in-revolt |location=Chicago, IL |publisher=Haymarket Books |pages=64, 108 &amp; 116 |isbn=1931859272 |author-link=David Cortright}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some chapters continued through 1971 and 1972 and one until 1975.

==Founding==

MDM started at the civilian supported ''Green Machine'' antiwar coffeehouse in Vista, CA not far from Camp Pendleton.&lt;ref name="Oceanside"&gt;[https://www.oceansidechamber.com/oceanside-blog/history-of-oceanside-1963-1987 Oceanside Chamber of Commerce History of Oceanside]&lt;/ref&gt; It began as a merger of a small group of sailors in San Diego called [[GI's Against Fascism]] and a larger group of marines at Camp Pendleton.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Barnes |first=Peter |date=1972 |title=Pawns: The Plight of the Citizen-Soldier |location=New York, NY |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |pages=128–9 |isbn=0-394-43616-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The San Diego group already had a newspaper called ''Duck Power'' and the marines began by publishing a newspaper called ''Attitude Check'' whose first issue, dated November 1, 1969, announced that it was "written by marines and ex-marines for the benefit of the common snuffy, grunt, and em." The organization seemed to hit a nerve among local marines and sailors and on December 14 in nearby Oceanside an estimated 1,000 Black, White and Chicano GIs were among 4,000 who participated in an antiwar march and rally with speeches by [[Donald W. Duncan]], [[Captain Howard Levy]], [[Angela Davis]] and a number of active duty GIs.&lt;ref name="Parsons" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Attitude"&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/39085/rec/2, Wisconsin Historical Society GI Press Collection: Attitude Check]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;

==Preamble and 12 Demands==

At this rally, MDM's spokespeople presented and explained the organization's Preamble and 12 Demands, which had also been published simultaneously in the December 1, 1970 issues of ''Duck Power'' and ''Attitude Check''. The Preamble stated "that ending the suppression of the American serviceman is an important part of a larger struggle for basic human rights" and pledged "support for the self-determination of all peoples." It ended, "We have been silent for a long time. We will be silent no longer."

The 12 demands included: An immediate end to the Vietnam War, collective bargaining for GIs, "human and constitutional rights [for] military men and women," the ending of censorship and intimidation within the military, the abolition of "mental and physical cruelty in military brigs, correctional custodies, and basic training", doing away with the "court-martial and non-judicial punishment systems," "wages equal to the federal minimum wage," "the abolition of the class structure of the military," an end to "all racism everywhere," the freeing of all political prisoners, including Eldridge Cleaver and Huey Newton," an end to "the glorification of war," and the abolition of the draft.&lt;ref name="Tishler"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tischler |first1=Barbara L. |date=1990 |title=Breaking Ranks: GI Antiwar Newspapers and the Culture of Protest |url=http://digitalcommons.lasalle.edu/vietnamgeneration/vol2/iss1/ |journal=Vietnam Generation |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=30–31 |issn=1042-7597 |access-date=2017-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/80964/rec/14, MDM Preamble and 12 Demands]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread==

===San Diego===

The pre-existing group of sailors in San Diego called ''GI's Against Fascism'' merged with the group at Camp Pendleton.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt; They all agreed to use the MDM name while publishing two newspapers, ''Duck Power'' in San Diego and ''Attitude Check'' at Pendleton. In mid-1970 the San Diego chapter changed the name of their newspaper to ''Dare to Struggle'' which they continued to publish until mid-1971. ''Attitude Check's'' last issue was in June 1970. The Camp Pendleton and San Diego areas were very pro-military and the MDM members located there experienced significant hostility and harassment.&lt;ref name="Oceanside" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parsons" /&gt; The San Diego area MDM had close ties with the [[San Diego Free Press]] which helped them put out their newspapers.

===Great Lakes Naval Station===

By early 1970 MDM had spread to several other cities and military bases. In January, a chapter formed at the [[Naval Station Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] naval base, located north of Chicago, IL, the largest U.S. Navy training base and the only boot camp for naval enlistees. Aided by activists with the Wisconsin Draft Resistance and the Chicago Area Military Project, a counseling service and coffeehouse, this chapter was one of the most active and included a considerable number of black sailors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cortright |first1=David |date=1990 |title=Black GI Resistance During the Vietnam War |url=http://digitalcommons.lasalle.edu/vietnamgeneration/vol2/iss1/ |journal=Vietnam Generation |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=59 |issn=1042-7597 |access-date=2017-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They began publishing ''The Navy Times Are Changing'' which continued until the end of 1972. On Armed Forces Day in May 1970 they sponsored a rally near the base which attracted 50 sailors and nearly 500 civilians. Another rally in September of that same year "drew a crowd of over five hundred sailors and civilians." When four Black WAVES were illegally arrested by base commanders in July 1970, more than 100 sailors marched to where the women were being held and surrounded the building, refusing to move until the women were released. Within weeks of this incident, over 900 enlisted men and women were discharged or transferred to other bases by the navy. On Armed Forces Day in 1972, MDM and the Chicago Area Military Project organized a large demonstration with 400 GIs joining a crowd of over 2,000.&lt;ref name="Cortright" /&gt;

===San Francisco Bay Area===

Tom Csekey, one of the sailors who founded ''GI's Against Fascism'' in San Diego traveled to San Francisco and helped form two chapters of MDM in the Bay Area. There was a short-lived chapter at [[Fort Ord]] near Monterey, CA which published the ''Right-On Post'' from May to August 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/2832/rec/43, Right-on Post]&lt;/ref&gt; And a San Francisco Bay Area chapter with members from the [[Naval Air Station Alameda|Alameda Naval Air Station]], [[Treasure Island, San Francisco]] and other military bases, which published their newspaper ''Up Against the Bulkhead'' regularly from 1970 to 1972 and then sporadically until to 1975. The ''Up Against the Bulkhead'' paper and staff played an important role in helping sailors from the [[USS Coral Sea (CV-43)#1971: Crewmen petition against the Vietnam War|USS Coral Sea]] organize a November 6, 1971 antiwar demonstration in San Francisco involving over 300 men from the ship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://libcom.org/history/1961-1973-gi-resistance-in-the-vietnam-war 1961-1973: GI resistance in the Vietnam War]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=Up_Against_the_Bulkhead Statement from Peter Wiley, Up Against the Bulkhead Staff member]&lt;/ref&gt; This chapter was the longest lasting MDM organization and their newspaper was one of the more professional and widely distributed.&lt;ref name="Tishler" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/89923/rec/72, Up Against the Bulkhead]&lt;/ref&gt;

===El Toro Marine Air Base===

In July 1970 another chapter formed at the [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro|El Toro Marine air base]] in Orange County, CA. They published a newspaper called ''Pay Back'' consistently until the end of 1970 and then sporadically for another year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/2481/rec/91, Pay Back]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fort Carson===

In mid-1970 a group of GI from the [[Fort Carson]] army base near Colorado Springs, CO began to meet and publish a newspaper called ''Counter Attack''. They were supported by the ''Homefront'' GI coffeehouse. As with all the other chapters, they experienced a high turnover rate and disbanded by mid-1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/86054/rec/18, Counter Attack]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==

MDM was more disciplined than most other GI resistance organizations of the period. At a June 1970 regional conference involving chapters from Camp Pendleton, San Diego, the Bay Area, Fort Ord, Long Beach, and El Toro the members approved 16 strict ''Rules for MDM Members''. These included no narcotics or marijuana, no racism, no male chauvinism or sexism, no criminal activity or stealing from the people, putting the interests and needs of the people before personal pleasure, mandatory participation in political education classes, no misuse of funds, and instructions that if arrested members were to give only name, rank, and serial number.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/59671/rec/136 Rules for MDM Members]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

Some critics of MDM have argued that their 12 demands, if implemented "would have rendered the U.S. military totally ineffective as a fighting force."&lt;ref name="Rothrock"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rothrock |first=James |date=2006 |title=Divided We Fall: How Disunity Leads to Defeat |location=Bloomington, IN |publisher=AuthorHouse |pages=228–30 |isbn=1-4259-1107-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in January 1971 in The Marine Corps Gazette, Marine commandant general [[Leonard F. Chapman Jr.]] said MDM was "a serious threat to the defense of this country."&lt;ref name="Parsons" /&gt;

===House Internal Security Committee===

The House Committee on Internal Security investigated MDM and the broader GI movement. They concluded that the GI Movement "is the organized efforts by relatively small numbers of GIs and pseudo pacifist civilians to enlist and engage the participation by United States armed services personnel in the so-called peace movement." A witness before the committee described MDM's efforts at Fort Ord as follows: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The general purpose of the MDM was to recruit soldiers, to propagandize them, to encourage them to file for conscientious objector status, to hold demonstrations enlisting their sympathy against the Army and the establishment, to conduct…certain operations aimed at distributing propaganda literature upon the military reservation illegally, and to disrupt in general and neutralize the effectiveness of Fort Ord as a military training base.&lt;ref name="Rothrock" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other Views===

Other observers agreed that MDM was on the more radical end of the GI movement but were more favorable.&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt; One scholar observed that MDM viewed "the war in a much broader context of military and social oppression that MDM hoped to eradicate. For many groups on the Left, ending the Vietnam conflict was a liberal issue in comparison to the more revolutionary goal of transforming American society. For members of the armed forces facing the prospect of combat in Southeast Asia, ending the war was a critical issue. The MDM demands, framed as they were in broad social and political terms, reflect a strong Left political influence on at least some of the GI antiwar groups."&lt;ref name="Tishler" /&gt; The ''Stanford Daily'' viewed MDM as a lifeline to the GIs: "These men have already suffered the dehumanization process of boot camp and many of them are being prepared for Viet Nam. They were living a nightmare of which there was little relief until MDM developed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hill |first=Penny |date=1970-02-12 |title=Movement for a Democratic Military |work=Stanford Daily }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radicalism===

MDM itself was quite upfront with its radicalism. As the August 1970 ''Right-on Post'' newspaper published at Fort Ord put it: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The goal of MDM as an organization is to educate GIs to the real causes of their oppression, and to help them move to put an end to the problem. Through a black-brown-white coalition, we will educate one another, struggle together and defend one another. Rising as one, with clenched fists, we will break the man's chains. We are not afraid of the man's stockades; we've been there. The Vietnamese freedom fighters have shown us the way: a united force of brothers and sisters determined to free themselves can defeat the U.S. military monster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/2832/rec/43, Right-on Post August 1970 p.12]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Harassment and Attacks==

Several of the MDM chapters and their affiliated GI coffeehouses experienced legal and non-legal harassment from the pro-military towns where they were located and even violent attacks from right-wing organizations. In one instance, the ''Green Machine'' coffeehouse near Camp Pendleton was shot up on April 29, 1970 with 45 caliber machine gun fire, wounding one of the marines inside in the shoulder. A clandestine paramilitary right-wing group called the Secret Army Organization was suspected.&lt;ref name="Cortright" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oceanside" /&gt; Another involved the San Diego Chapter on February 8, 1970. According to the lawyer and author Mark Lane, the San Diego Police and Navy Shore Patrol

&lt;blockquote&gt;"smashed down the door of a San Diego store front…to break up a peaceful meeting of Marines, Sailors and civilians." This was preceded by "several hours of terror on the streets in the vicinity by the local and military police during which civilians were threatened and detained by the cops and GI's were taken into custody, physically pushed around and finally arrested on non-existent charges."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lane |first=Mark |date=1970-02-13 |title=Cops Attack Anti-war GIs |work=Los Angeles Free Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/28124/rec/77, MDM Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==

MDM may have been the most radical of the GI antiwar and military resistance organizations of significant size during the Vietnam War. It has been estimated that they had between five thousand and ten thousand members and they had viable chapters in over half-a-dozen military bases and cities.&lt;ref name="Cortright" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt; Their stand against the Vietnam War, their call for self-determination of all peoples and their opposition to discrimination and racism proved popular with a segment of GI, particularly minority GIs, as was the idea of democratizing the military. The military considered them a serious threat. With the transfer and discharge of many of its most active members, chapters were hard to sustain and by the end of the Vietnam War, MDM's last remaining chapter dissolved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8673">'''Operation Scarlift''' (also known as '''Project 500''' or '''The Bond Issue Program'''&lt;ref name = "pa portal"/&gt;) was a program carried out by the [[Pennsylvania]] government in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name = "clearinghouse"&gt;{{Citation|author = Abandoned Mine Reclamation Clearinghouse|url = http://www.amrclearinghouse.org/Sub/SCARLIFTReports/|title = Operation Scarlift Reports|year = 2005|accessdate = April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission was to repair [[environmental damage]] caused by abandoned mine lands, [[acid mine drainage]], and other issues associated with historic mining. The operation began around the time that the Land and Water Conservation and Reclamation Act was passed and became inactive in the 1970s due to a lack of funding. During the operation, a total of $141,000,000 was spent on a variety of tasks, including remedying pollution in hundreds of streams, extinguishing dozens of mine fires, and constructing acid mine drainage treatment plants. Numerous reports on mining-impacted streams were produced during the operation, many of which continue to be used for assessing watersheds.

==Background==
On May 16, 1967, voters in Pennsylvania approved a $500 million [[bond issue]] for the purpose of resolving environmental problems.&lt;ref name = "pa portal"&gt;{{Citation|url = http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/operation_scarlift/21625|title = Operation Scarlift and Mine Reclamation in Pennsylvania|accessdate = April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Pennsylvania passed the [[Land and Water Conservation and Reclamation Act]], which was the first act in the United States concerning [[abandoned mine reclamation]]. It was this act that led to the formation of Operation Scarlift to repair damage caused by abandoned mines.&lt;ref name = "pawatersheds"&gt;{{Citation|author = Pennsylvania Organization for Watersheds and Rivers|url = http://pawatersheds.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/abandonedmine.pdf|title = History of Abandoned Mine Reclamation in Pennsylvania|page = 4|accessdate = April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A chunk of the money from the $500 million bond issue was used to fund the operation.&lt;ref name = "pa portal"/&gt;

Operation Scarlift is so-named because of its mission to remove the "scars" left by historical mining activities in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name = "asce paper"&gt;{{Citation|author1=C.H. McConnell |author2=Donald E. Fowler |author3=Andrew E. Friedrich |url = http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Mining/Abandoned%20Mine%20Reclamation/AbandonedMinePortalFiles/OperationScarlift/Operation_Scarlift-Mine_Drainage_Abatement_ASCE-1976.pdf|title = Operation Scarlift – Mine Drainage Abatement|pages = 9, 14, 18, 22, 24|year = 1976|accessdate = April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
The purpose of Operation Scarlift was to remedy the environmental damage that historic [[mining]] in Pennsylvania has caused to the land, water, and air.&lt;ref name = "clearinghouse"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "pawatersheds"/&gt; The operation carried out [[abandoned mine reclamation]] projects.&lt;ref name = "pa portal"/&gt; These projects addressed such environmental issues as abandoned [[strip mine]]s, open [[underground mine]] shafts, burning refuse banks, [[mine fire]]s, identifying and gathering data on [[acid mine drainage]] sites across Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name = "pa portal"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "clearinghouse"/&gt; The operation built a series of lime neutralization stations to remedy acid mine drainage.&lt;ref name = "regional"/&gt; Additionally, it produced dozens of studies on mining-impacted areas, including [[drainage basin|watersheds]] and mine complexes.&lt;ref name = "clearinghouse"/&gt; These reports were created between 1968 and 1982.&lt;ref name = "pa portal"/&gt;

The actions taken by Operation Scarlift used a total of $141,000,000.&lt;ref name = "pawatersheds"/&gt; It used the money to carry out 500 stream pollution abatement projects, eliminate 150 areas of [[Subsidence#Mining|mine subsidence]], extinguish 75 [[mine fire]]s, and alleviate [[air pollution]] at 30 burning refuse banks.&lt;ref name = "pawatersheds"/&gt; Between 1968 and 1981, approximately $78,000,000 were spent on remedying stream pollution and approximately $64,000,000 was spent on the other tasks carried out by the operation.&lt;ref name = "pa portal"/&gt; By 1976, {{convert|48|mi|km}} of streams had been made free of pollution by the operation and another {{convert|140|mi|km}} had had their pollution levels reduced. A total of 32 deep mine complexes were sealed and {{convert|2600|acre|km2}} were reclaimed.&lt;ref name = "asce paper"/&gt;

Operation Scarlift was first administered by the Department of Mines and Mineral Industries. Later, that role passed to the Pennsylvania Department Environmental Resources (now known as the [[Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection]]).&lt;ref name = "pa portal"/&gt; Operation Scarlift became inactive in the 1970s after using up all the money provided by its [[revenue bond]].&lt;ref name = "regional"&gt;{{Citation|author = Committee on Water Quality Improvement for the Pittsburgh Region, Water Science and Technology Board, Division on Earth and Life Studies, National Research Council|publisher = [[National Academies Press]]|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=g1xYAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=%22Operation+Scarlift%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kkhNMFr4Qf&amp;sig=sngRbnRfHjDz4wALYeQ12qpRLJg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4DwgVa6pIIv6sAXFoIP4Bg&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Operation%20Scarlift%22&amp;f=false|title = Regional Cooperation for Water Quality Improvement in Southwestern Pennsylvania|page = 49|date = April 4, 2005|accessdate = April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stream pollution remedies===
Operation Scarlift had two main methods for remedying stream pollution by acid mine drainage. These methods were source correction and treatment. Source correction methods in deep mines included deep mine sealing and reducing the flow of surface water into deep mines. The operation also carried out various source correction procedures on [[strip mine]]s and refuse banks. Where source correction was impractical, treatment was used instead. Treatment sometimes used [[lime (material)|lime]] or [[limestone]] and was successful at reducing [[acidity]] and [[iron]] concentrations. However, due to the high cost involved, the operation rarely attempted to treat high [[sulfate]] concentrations except when remedying pollution in sources of potable water.&lt;ref name = "asce paper"/&gt; Nevertheless, several  chemical treatment plants were constructed, and were largely successful. However, several were shut down due to the high cost involved in maintaining them. In the 1980s, some of the remaining funds were used to attempt to construct [[passive treatment system]]s such as aerobic and anaerobic [[wetland]]s and [[pond]]s. However, these systems were mostly ineffective.&lt;ref name = "amd"&gt;{{Citation|url = http://www.ei.lehigh.edu/envirosci/enviroissue/amd/links/bamr1.html|title = Abandoned Mine Reclamation Problems: Successes, Problems and Lessons learned|accessdate = April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
While Operation Scarlift was underway, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection periodically created updates on the status of the operation. These updates were known as Bond Issue Report and the last one was published in 1990. It serves as a historical summary of the operation's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url = http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/operation_scarlift/21625/bond_issue_report_-_1990/1695679|title = Bond Issue Report – 1990|accessdate = April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation Scarlift has been described as achieving "limited success" with acid mine drainage abatement.&lt;ref name = "amd"/&gt; Despite being several decades old, the information in the reports produced by Operation Scarlift "still provides much valuable background information for groups assessing their watershed", as described by the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Clearinghouse.&lt;ref name = "clearinghouse"/&gt; A number of the reports on mining-impacted watersheds "remain the best descriptions and outlines of the AMD problems in the watersheds".&lt;ref name = "pa portal"/&gt; The reports were scanned and [[Digitization|digitized]] in the 2000s.&lt;ref name = "clearinghouse"/&gt;

[[File:Friedenspreis-ffm-2009-magris-005.jpg|thumb|Ceremony in 2009]]
The '''Peace Prize of the German Book Trade''' ({{lang-de|'''Friedenspreis des Deutschen Buchhandels'''}}) is an international peace prize given yearly at the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] in the [[Frankfurter Paulskirche|Paulskirche]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]], Germany. It has been awarded by the Börsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels since 1950 and the winner is remunerated with {{currency|25,000|EUR}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Der Friedenspreis des Deutschen Buchhandels|url=http://www.boersenverein.de/de/96402|publisher=Börsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels|language=German|accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its statute, “(t)he foundation is committed to peace, humanity and understanding among all peoples and nations of the world. The Peace Prize promotes international tolerance by acknowledging individuals who have contributed to these ideals through their exceptional activities, especially in the fields of literature, science and art. Prize winners are chosen without any reference to their national, racial or religious background."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.friedenspreis-des-deutschen-buchhandels.de/445943/&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the [[President of Germany]] and leading [[politics|political]], [[culture|cultural]] and [[diplomat]]ic persons attend the ceremony and [[ZDF|ZDF TV]] covers the event.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5227">'''Policy Studies Organization''' is an academic organization whose purpose is to advance the study of [[policy analysis]] by publishing [[academic journal]]s and book series, sponsoring conferences and producing programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.ipsonet.org/about-us|website=Policy Studies Organization|accessdate=11 July 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Policy Studies Organization|url=http://www.apsanet.org/RESOURCES/For-the-Public/Political-Science-Organizations/Related-Cognate-Associations/Policy-Studies-Organization-|website=www.apsanet.org|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1972, the Policy Studies Organization formed out of the [[American Political Science Association]] to focus on important public policy issues. Some of the goals of the PSO was to sponsor conferences, obtain discounts for subscriptions and books, and encourage panels conventions both regionally and nationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1972|title=News and Notes|jstor=2392155|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|volume=17|issue=3|pages=410–415}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Policy Studies Journal]] was also established alongside the PSO to focus on policy matters like environmental protection, education, peace, and civil liberties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1975|title=Back Matter|jstor=4531621|journal=Policy Sciences|volume=6|issue=4|pages=480–480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1978|title=Back Matter|jstor=4531729|journal=Policy Sciences|volume=9|issue=2|pages=258–258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conferences ==
The Policy Studies Organization sponsors conferences year round to promote multidisciplinary conversations of relevant policy issues. The goal of these events is to encourage NGOs, government officials, students, academics, and the general public to engage in dialogues about on-going policy concerns. These conferences are co-sponsored by the [[American Public University System]]. The following are conferences held by the PSO annually:

*''PSW Lecture Series''
*''Middle East Dialogue''
*''World Conference on Fraternalism, Social Capital, and Civil Society''
*''International Criminology Conference''
*''Summit on Global Food Security and Health''
*''Asian Politics and Policy Conference''
*''Dupont Summit on Science, Technology, and Environmental Policy''

== Publications ==
A key component of the Policy Studies Organization is its publications. Through its journals, book series, and open access journals, the PSO aims to disseminate policy scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/15410072/homepage/society.html|title=Policy Studies Journal :|website=onlinelibrary.wiley.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the journals are published through Wiley-Blackwell or through open access. The PSO also publishes antiquated and original books through its own Westphalia Press imprint; titles range on subjects like history, art, politics, and the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://westphaliapress.org|title=Westphalia Press|website=Westphalia Press|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''prevalence of circumcision''' is the percentage of males in a given population who have been [[circumcision|circumcised]]. The rates vary widely by country, from virtually 0% in [[Honduras]], to 7% in [[Spain]], to 20% in the [[United Kingdom]], to 45% in [[South Africa]], to 80% in the [[United States of America|United States]], to over 90% in many [[Muslim world|Muslim-majority countries]].&lt;ref name="WHO-GTPDSA"&gt;{{Cite web

==Overview==

Male circumcision is nearly universal in the [[Muslim world]] and in [[Israel]] due to the religious beliefs of the majority of [[Muslims]] and [[Jews]]; however, some non-Muslim groups living within Muslim-majority countries, such as [[Armenians]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], do not practise it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi = 10.1007/978-94-007-6407-1_20|chapter = Reclaiming Circumcision: Armenian Stories|title = Genital Cutting: Protecting Children from Medical, Cultural, and Religious Infringements|pages = 307–315|year = 2013|last1 = Vardanyan|first1 = Astrik N|isbn = 978-94-007-6406-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is prevalent in some Muslim-majority countries in [[southeast Asia]] such as [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]]; however, the WHO states that there is "little non-religious circumcision in [[Asia]], with the exceptions of the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]] and the [[Philippines]]".&lt;ref name="WHO-GTPDSA"/&gt; In parts of [[Africa]] it is often practised as part of tribal or religious customs. The prevalence of circumcision is also high in the [[United States]], although there has been a slight (~6%) decrease in routine neonatal circumcision in recent years.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In contrast, rates are much lower in most of [[Europe]], parts of [[southern Africa]], most of Asia, [[Oceania]] and [[Latin America]], constituting [[South America]], [[Central America]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Drain"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drain PK, Halperin DT, Hughes JP, Klausner JD, Bailey RC | title = Male circumcision, religion, and infectious diseases: an ecologic analysis of 118 developing countries | journal = BMC Infectious Diseases | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 172 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17137513 | pmc = 1764746 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2334-6-172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom are examples of countries that have seen a decline in male circumcision in recent decades, while there have been indications of increasing demand in southern Africa, partly for preventive reasons due to the [[HIV]] [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|epidemic there]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wise J | title = Demand for male circumcision rises in a bid to prevent HIV | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 84 | issue = 7 | pages = 509–11 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16878217 | pmc = 2627386 | url = http://www.scielosp.org/pdf/bwho/v84n7/v84n7a05.pdf | quote = As a result, there are already indications of increasing demand for male circumcision in traditionally non-circumcising societies in Southern Africa. | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==
Studies indicate that about 62% of African males are circumcised. However, the rate varies widely between different regions, and among ethnic and religious groups, with Muslim North Africans practising it for religious reasons, central Africans as part of tribal rituals or local custom, (with some practising [[female genital mutilation]] as well) and some traditionally non-circumcising populations in the South recently adopting the practice due to measures by the World Health Organisation to prevent AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Questions and answers: NIAID-sponsored adult male circumcision trials in Kenya and Uganda |publisher=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases |date=December 2006 |url=http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/QA/AMC12_QA.htm |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309060025/https://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/QA/AMC12_QA.htm |archive-date=9 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Williams, B.G. ''et al.'' commented that: "Most of the currently available data on the prevalence of [male circumcision] are several decades old, while several of the recent studies were carried out as adjuncts to demographic and health surveys and were not designed to determine the prevalence of [male circumcision]."&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams BG, Lloyd-Smith JO, Gouws E, Hankins C, Getz WM, Hargrove J, de Zoysa I, Dye C, Auvert B | title = The potential impact of male circumcision on HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = e262 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16822094 | pmc = 1489185 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumcision in Canada followed the pattern that existed in other English speaking countries, picking up the practice during the 1900s to prevent masturbation and other perceived issues of the time, and then had its rate of circumcision decline due to new policy statements passed and due to coverage for the procedure being dropped, with a pattern of declining incidence of circumcision occurring from 1970 to 1979 after a new policy statement was released In 1975.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Paediatric Society]] offered an estimate of 48 percent for the prevalence of male circumcision in Canada in 1970 prior to this fall in prevalence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Neonatal circumcision revisited.

For Example, [[Yukon]] reported a rate of 74.8 percent in while [[Newfoundland]] reported an incidence of 1.9 to 2.4 percent in 1977-78.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wirth JL | title = Current circumcision practices: Canada | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 66 | issue = 5 | pages = 705–8 | date = November 1980 | pmid = 7432876 | pmc =  | doi =  | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/66/5/705.abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate continued to drop, with the newborn circumcision rate in Ontario In 1994-95 dropping to 29.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Goel |first= V.

A survey of Canadian maternity practices conducted in 2006/2007 and published in 2009 by the national public health agency found a newborn circumcision rate of 31.9%.&lt;ref name="phac"/&gt; Rates varied markedly across the country, from close to zero in [[Newfoundland]] and [[Labrador]] to 44.3% in [[Alberta]].

====United States====
The [[Centers For Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) uses two data sources to track circumcision rates. The first is the [[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]] (NHANES), which records circumcisions performed at any time at any location. The second is the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS), which does not record circumcisions performed outside the hospital setting or those performed at any age following discharge from the birth hospitalization.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morris BJ, Bailis SA, Wiswell TE | title = Circumcision rates in the United States: rising or falling? What effect might the new affirmative pediatric policy statement have? | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 89 | issue = 5 | pages = 677–86 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24702735 | doi = 10.1016/j.mayocp.2014.01.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based off NHANES data, the CDC estimated that 80.5% of American males aged 14 to 59 years old from 2005 to 2010 were circumcised. Among racial breakdown, 90.8% of [[Non-Hispanic whites|non-Hispanic white males]], 75.7% of non-Hispanic [[African Americans|black]], and 44% of [[Mexican American]] males from that same age group and time span were circumcised.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Based off NHDS data, the CDC reported a national decline in circumcision rates of newborns, from 64.5% to 58.3%, during the 32-year period from 1972 to 2010. Trends varied regionally, with the Midwest mirroring the national trend; in the Northeast there was no discernible trend in the 32-year period; the South experienced an increase in circumcision rates from 1979 until 1998 and then a decline until 2010; finally, the West saw a decrease of 37% during the period in question, with the biggest drop happening in the 1980's, continuing with a slower decrease until 2010.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Trends in Circumcision for Male Newborns in U.S. Hospitals: 1979-2010|author=The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Health Care Statistics |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/circumcision_2013/circumcision_2013.pdf|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decline is in large part due to the growing Hispanic population.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is increasingly common due do increasing health care costs that health care providers require the mother and baby to leave the hospital within 24 hours after birth without complications. As a result, a large number of circumcisions are performed in out-patient clinics and are not recorded in the NHDS data.

In 2009, the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) reported its findings regarding newborn circumcisions based on U.S. region and income bracket. Its data came from several states' hospital associations and health departments. The Western Region reported a rate of 24.6%, the North Central Region reported a rate of 76.2%, the Northeast Region reported a rate of 67%, and the Southern Region reported a rate of 55.7%. The combined newborn circumcision rate of all regions was 54.5%, which is similar but slightly lower than the NHDS data from 2010. There was also significant variation between rural and urban areas. Rural areas reported a rate of 66.9%, while urban areas reported a rate of 41.2%. The lowest income bracket reported a rate of 51.5%, while the highest income bracket reported a rate of 60.4%.&lt;ref name="hcup" /&gt;

[[Medicaid]] funding for infant circumcision used to be available in every state, but starting with California in 1982, 18 states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, and Washington) had eliminated Medicaid coverage of routine (non-therapeutic) circumcision by July 2011.&lt;ref name = "adler"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Another study, published in early 2009, found a difference in the neonatal male circumcision rate of 24% between states with and without Medicaid coverage. The study was controlled for other factors such as the percentage of Hispanic patients.&lt;ref name="Leibovitz"&gt;

Circumcision was the second-most common procedure performed on patients under one year of age.&lt;ref&gt;Pfuntner A., Wier L.M., Stocks C. Most Frequent Procedures Performed in U.S. Hospitals, 2011. HCUP Statistical Brief #165. October 2013. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD. [http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb165.jsp].&lt;/ref&gt; There are various explanations for why the infant circumcision rate in the United States is different from comparable countries. Many parents’ decisions about circumcision are preconceived, which may contribute to the high rate of elective circumcision.&lt;ref name="CSA:I-99"&gt;{{cite web|date=December 1999 |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/13585.html |title=Report 10 of the Council on Scientific Affairs (I-99):Neonatal Circumcision |website=1999 AMA Interim Meeting: Summaries and Recommendations of Council on Scientific Affairs Reports |pages=17 |publisher=[[American Medical Association]] |access-date=2006-06-13 |deadurl=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705182814/http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/13585.html |archive-date=5 July 2007 }}

====South Korea====
Circumcision is largely a modern-day phenomenon in South Korea. While the rate in the twentieth century has been nearing 80%, virtually no circumcision was performed just a century ago, as it was against Korea's long and strong tradition of preserving the body as a gift from parents.&lt;ref name="Kimetal"/&gt; A 2001 study of 20-year-old South Korean men found that 78% were circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ku JH, Kim ME, Lee NK, Park YH | title = Circumcision practice patterns in South Korea: community based survey | journal = Sexually Transmitted Infections | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–7 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12576619 | pmc = 1744613 | doi = 10.1136/sti.79.1.65 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the authors commented that "South Korea has possibly the largest absolute number of teenage or adult circumcisions anywhere in the world. Because circumcision started through contact with the American military during the Korean War, South Korea has an unusual history of circumcision." According to a 2002 study, 86.3% of South Korean males aged 14–29 were circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pang MG, Kim DS | title = Extraordinarily high rates of male circumcision in South Korea: history and underlying causes | journal = BJU International | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 48–54 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11849160 | doi = 10.1046/j.1464-410x.2002.02545.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, it's the case of 75.8% of the same age group. Only after 1999 has some information against circumcision become available (at the time of the 2012 study, only 3% of Korean internet sites, using the most popular Korean search engine [[Naver]], are against indiscriminate circumcision and 97% are for).&lt;ref name="Kimetal"/&gt; The authors of the study speculate "that the very existence of information about the history of Korean circumcision, its contrary nature relative to a longstanding tradition, its introduction by the US military, etc., has been extremely influential on the decision-making process regarding circumcision."&lt;ref name="Kimetal"/&gt;

A national survey on sexual attitudes in 2000 found that 15.8% of men or boys in the United Kingdom (ages 16–44) were circumcised by their parents' choosing. 11.7% of 16- to 19-year-olds, and 19.6% of 40- to 44-year-olds said they had been circumcised. Apart from black Caribbeans, men born overseas were more likely to be circumcised.&lt;ref name="Dave2003" /&gt; Rickwood ''et al.'' reported that the proportion of English boys circumcised for medical reasons had fallen from 35% in the early 1930s to 6.5% by the mid-1980s.

They called for a target to reduce the percentage to 2%.

In Finland, the overall prevalence of circumcision is 2-4%, according to a recent publication by the Finnish Health Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.terveyskirjasto.fi/xmedia/duo/duo98530.pdf|title = Esinahan kirurgia|date = |access-date = 20 October 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Maija|first = Kolehmainen|first2 = Seppo|last2 = Taskinen | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents found that 10.9% of boys aged 0–17 had been circumcised.&lt;ref name="kamtsiuris"/&gt;

In France, according to a telephone survey (TNS Sofres Institute, 2008), 14% of men are circumcised.&lt;ref name="manix.net"&gt;[http://www.manix.net/enjoy/sex-news/sex-stat-1/index.cfm?i=1132 Telephone survey of the TNS Sofres Institute (commissioned by Manix), 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808004024/http://www.manix.net/enjoy/sex-news/sex-stat-1/index.cfm?i=1132 |date=8 August 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Slovenia]], a 1999-2001 national probability sample of the general population aged 18–49 years found that overall, 4.5% of Slovenian male citizens reported being circumcised. Prevalence strongly varied across religious groups, with 92.4% of Muslims being circumcised, 1.7% of Roman Catholics, 0% of other religious affiliations (Evangelic, Serbian Orthodox, other), and 7.1% of those with no religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klavs I, Hamers FF | title = Male circumcision in Slovenia: results from a national probability sample survey | journal = Sexually Transmitted Infections | volume = 84 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–50 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 17881413 | doi = 10.1136/sti.2007.027524 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5962502 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Circumcision reached its peak in Australia in the 1950s with a rate of more than 80%, but has steadily fallen to an estimated 26% in 2012. The rate of circumcision has dropped rapidly over the years. It is estimated that males aged roughly 80 percent of males 35 and under are intact, and remaining 20 percent are circumcised. Circumcision rates have declined drastically in recent years as young fathers are starting to have children of their own and leaving them intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.circinfo.org/statistics.html |title=Incidence and prevalence of circumcision in Australia |website=Circumcision Information Australia |date=January 2013 |access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Longitudinal Study of Health and Relationships is a computer assisted telephone interview of males aged 16–64 that uses a nationally representative population sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith AM, Pitts MK, Shelley JM, Richters J, Ferris J | title = The Australian longitudinal study of health and relationships | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 7 | issue =  | pages = 139 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17608953 | pmc = 1931435 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-7-139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the interview found that the prevalence of circumcision in Australia was roughly 58%.

Consequently, circumcised males tend to be older.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Medicare Australia]] records show the number of males younger than six months that underwent circumcision dropped from 19,663 in 2007/08 to 6309 (4%) in 2016/17.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/why-is-the-number-of-male-circumcisions-declining-in-australia |title=Why is the number of male circumcisions declining in Australia? |author=Rashida Yosufzai |work=SBS News |date=19 February 2018 |access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public/social/private partnerships''' are methods of co-operation between private and government bodies.

==Background==

===Models of cooperation between the market and the state: examples from Austria===
The name “public social private partnership” (PSPP) is a development of [[Public Private Partnership]] (PPP).

PPP is one expression of a strong trend towards (re)[[privatisation]], which in some European countries has arisen as a result of more difficult economic conditions in recent years and the associated structural crisis in the public sector (see Eschenbach, Müller, Gabriel: 1993). 

The growth in [[public-private partnerships]] as a way of fulfilling public tasks in partnership between the state administration and private enterprises must be seen in this context.

In political discussions, lack of public funds is often put forward as a limit on state activities. Instead of financing infrastructure projects alone, the government increasingly looks to cooperations with private investors. Also, the [[European Union|EU]] [[policy]] on competitive tendering of public works and services has forced changes towards a more market-oriented approach to delivering tasks for which the state is responsible. Another relevant factor are the arguments in debates on privatisation that state bodies are inefficient and that management concepts typical in the commercial sector should be used to achieve more cost-effective provision of public services.
All these factors taken together result in a shift away from a role of the state as “producer” towards one as “quality assurer” and a trend away from collective, tax-based financing of infrastructure to financing models in which these are paid for by their users (see Budäus 2006).

The term PPP has gained currency for this increased cooperation of government with private partners in the German-speaking countries since about the middle of the 1990s. 

'''Public private partnership contrasted with conventional provision of public services'''
PPPs can be said to differ from other forms of provision of public services in the following 3 points:

* In PPPs, the ownership of the project is shared. The heart of a PPP is thus the sharing of risks and profits.
* Compared to providing the service directly, in a PPP the state can concentrate on its core competences. The state does not need to allocate experts of its own for the implementation of the project and is thus less intimately involved.
* Additionally, PPPs exhibit a trend away from conventional, tax-based financing approaches towards financing through contributions of individual users (e.g. tolls for motorways).

===From PPP to PSPP===
In the social services sector, PPPs have been implemented mainly in the health services and overseas development until now. As current discussions about PPPs in the social services sector show (see e.g. the [[EQUAL Community Initiative|EQUAL]] [[development partnership]] “Public Social Private Partnership” [https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/equal/jsp/dpComplete.jsp?cip=AT&amp;national=3B-18%2F314]; workshop at the [[University of Cologne]], [[Germany]] “PPP in social and educational services”, March 2006; Conference: “Partnerships in Work Integration: Added Value for Enterprises?”, [[Zürich]], [[Switzerland]], October 2005), this sector has special requirements and will need special conditions and criteria for possible PPPs. The definition of goals is a particularly central and sensitive issue in finding a suitable form and modalities of implementation of PPPs in this area. Existing types of PPP will likely need to be modified to include extra mechanisms and criteria in order to function adequately in social services. 

In other words, public social private partnership (PSPP) is not merely an extension of the PPP idea, but a precondition for ensuring that a PPP with a social goal: 
* assures and implements the public aims, agendas and tasks in the sense of community benefit, welfare, etc.;
* adheres to and sustains the agendas and aims of cooperations in the mid- and long-term;
* plans and suitably applies the necessary conditions and resources (e.g. financing) for [[sustainability|sustainable]] results.

For the [[State (polity)|state]] side of the partnership the redefinition from PPP to PSPP means that mid- to long-term solutions are found for functions that the state needs to fulfil for reasons of the common good or welfare provision. By addressing state functions in the form of partnerships, the state partner gains options for action: firstly through a cooperative form of [[outsourcing]] (including financing) and secondly by involving additional partners from private enterprise and social enterprise in doing things which the state has responsibility for. Both of these aspects allow the state to do its job in a more rounded, professional and sustainable way by bringing in additional finance, expertise and practical resources. 

For private enterprises, PSPP opens up possibilities for new kinds of business activity through the cooperation with the state and social enterprise. 

PSPPs offer social enterprises an opportunity to act in their ideal role of intermediaries between the state and private sectors, helping to make sure that each partner’s contribution to the project is in an area where they have special competence. This reduces the risks for all partners. The social enterprise partners stand to gain from a PSPP in terms of planning, development and quality due to the mid- and long-term nature of the projects. 

Finally, for target groups of disadvantaged people, PSPPs can mean the assurance of services that they need, and that the welfare state has led them to expect; and also, mid- and long-term PSPPs have the chance to anticipate future needs and develop innovative solutions and services. 

To summarize, application of a PPP model to fulfilling social aims for people in disadvantaged situations naturally leads to expansion of the PPP to a PSPP. PSPP rather than PPP criteria become applicable when public aims such as the common good and welfare are being pursued. In this area, all the mid- and long-term indicators of success belonging to the agendas and goals of the cooperation depend on the correct adherence to PSPP specifications.

==PSPP: public social private partnership – description of the model==

===Description===
Observing the discussions among representatives of social enterprise on the issue of “public social private partnership”, it becomes apparent that it is necessary to distinguish between a broad and a narrow definition. The definition can be regarded as a basis on which a specification is to be constructed.
PSPP in the broad definition covers, like PPP, cooperation models between the participants. In the case of public social private partnership these are not only agencies of the state and private enterprises (as in PPP) but also social enterprises and social economic organizations. The focus is on the partnership formed between the participating organizations and enterprises with the aim of working out and implementing social aims.
The two main characteristics of a PSPP in the broad definition are therefore:
#The social purpose: Carrying out activities for the protection, support and improvement of opportunities for disadvantaged people or groups of disadvantaged people.
#Implementation in partnership: The concept of partnership between firstly public, secondly purely commercial and thirdly social economic organizations and enterprises.

The specification of the PSPP model makes sense because of the needs of disadvantaged people and of the social economy and also those of the state and private enterprise mentioned above. In order to ensure that disadvantaged people are not excluded completely or partially from social participation, their needs must be supplied long-term and uninterruptedly. To do this, the relevant social services must be provided. This can only be guaranteed through longer-term financing. 
For that reason, the narrow definition of “public social private partnership” picks up on the financing aspect of the functional description of PPP and attempts to see how this can be harnessed for social interests. Also in this case the partnership aspect is important (see below), and only through it can the long-term nature and opening up of new fields of action be achieved. 

A PSP partnership is thus related to a specific field of activity and has the explicit purpose of assuring long-term financing and generation of resources for products and services in order to fulfil purposes of social protection, support and improvement of opportunities for disadvantaged people or groups of disadvantaged people: PPP as a financing and resource-generating instrument becomes PSPP in this case. 

The following three main characteristics make up a public social private partnership:

#The “S” of the name indicates exactly the goal and purpose of the financing tool: the servicing of social protection and support interests and activities for the improvement of opportunities for disadvantaged people or groups of disadvantaged people. 
While PPPs as described in the literature as being used to execute public tasks in general, in PSPP the scope is narrowed to specifically social topics.
#A PSPP has the character of a financing or resource-generating instrument. 
In order to act in the interest of social protection and support, i.e. to provide social services or introduce social products, in many cases it is necessary to set up and operate infrastructure. 
PSPP projects therefore aim at financing infrastructure that is used to realize social services and products. In this respect PSPPs do the same thing as PPP projects, which are also usually set up to finance infrastructure.
To provide social services it may not always be necessary to set up infrastructure on a large scale, but it is always necessary to carry out a phase of developing, planning and organizing the prerequisites for providing the social services. PSPP as a financing instrument can thus also be used to finance the development and preparation of social products and services that do not require any large infrastructure investments. 
Different financing instruments are used depending on whether infrastructure needs to be financed or not. 
#“Partnership” means that to operate the tool at least two partners are required that will generate the finance and other resources needed to achieve the shared goal “s”. 
The PSPP characteristic “partnershaft” is also similar to a PPP. Three characteristics of PPPs identified by Budäus (2006:19) will be integrated at this point: 

* Partnership principle in the sense that the aims and expectations of benefit of the participating partner enterprises and organizations are compatible with each other. 
* Partnership principle in the sense of creation of synergies.
* Identity of the partner enterprises and organizations remains intact.

Also in this point PSPP differs from the conventional methods of delivering state services. In contrast to PPP projects, which can be formed with only two partners, “partnership” in the case of PSPP ideally involves a minimum of three partners, since there are three essential but different roles to be filled: The financing of the project, the project leadership and the demand for the social services.

In a PSPP three functions must therefore be exercised: 
At least one of the partners ensures the financing (financing level), at least one of the partners takes on the overall responsibility for the project and thus leads the coordination of the project from planning through setting-up and realization of the social product or service (project leadership) and at least one of the partners ensures the flow of funds into the project by buying the product or service (so also contributing to the financing). 
These three functions are – as described under roles and functions – ideally taken on by three partner enterprises and/or organizations that have the relevant competences and responsibilities. As a minimum, the synergies can also be created between two partner enterprises or organizations, so long as the three functions are present. 
In this way, a PSPP partnership is a partnership between two levels: the financing and the practical level.

===Purposes===
According to their historically conditioned self-understanding, contemporary European states have highly diverse tasks. A centrally important role is the social interest in various protective functions and activities. Besides the basic function of the state and community to stabilize or if possible to improve socially precarious or unstable conditions, the state has the duty to protect the weak and endangered at all levels of state activity, i.e. by law, in the justice system and in the administration.

Typical areas in which the state intervenes to protect people in weaker positions are consumer law, residential property rental and of course social law. The way the state(s) go about implementing these measures has to be seen against the background of the whole legal framework; the legal principles and practical methods involved are subject to continual theoretical (e.g. in terms of sociology, political science or philosophy) and practical (e.g. in the popular media or political interest groups) discussion. Connected to the issue of “protection” are terms such as “common good”, “human dignity”, “equality”, “welfare”, “clientele politics”, etc.

If the duty of the Hobbesian “Leviathan” to guarantee and provide protection is primarily related to individuals or subgroups of the state’s population, then the interests of social maintenance directed towards the state will focus mainly on the assurance of whole-society pluralities and minimum standards. The interest in social maintenance stands alongside the interest in protection and complements it. For example, the laws that regulate the entitlement to unemployment money belong to the “protection” sphere, whereas the laws on the activities of political parties belong to the “maintenance” sphere; the overlapping of the two spheres of interests becomes evident when various parties, according to their political programmes, (can) take influence on the laws that govern the situation of unemployed people, by changing laws through the mechanisms provided by law for creating legislation. 

Such social “protection” and “maintenance” interest being addressed to the state place a duty upon it to serve these interests through legislation and in the exercise of executive power; both in the inner sphere of lawgiving, justice and administration and in the outer sphere of cooperation with non-state actors in the form of “social partnerships”.

The legal phrase “''Gesellschaftliche Schutz- und Erhaltungsinteressen''", i.e. social protection and maintenance interests, only partly defines the goals of a PSPP. This needs to be expanded for the purpose of the present discussion to “activities to improve the living situation and opportunities of people and groups of people in disadvantaged circumstances”. This expansion is more specific because it refers to people. However, the question as to when people or groups of people are or become socially disadvantaged remains open.

As a point of reference for PSPP the principles of action of a democratic state should be chosen. The democratically legitimated state follows principles of the common good as a way of “guaranteeing [its citizens] optimal overall opportunities for living and expression/development” (Reinhold 2000:204). The state’s conception of what the common good is, is expressed in laws. This makes constitutions and city statutes the most suitable indicators of the smallest-common -denominator consensus as to what can be considered to be the common good in a democratically organised society. Beyond this, at any particular point in time the current government is an expression of the society’s current vision of the common good. 
If we follow the chain of the “common good” orientation down from the national to the local level, we arrive at other structures e.g. in Austria the provinces and the local communities/municipalities, each of which has to some extent its own definition of the common good.
If certain people or groups of people do not have full access to the elements of what, as legitimated by the democratic legal system, is regarded as an acceptable minimum level of income, welfare, general living conditions and social participation, then we can say that they are socially disadvantaged. 

The state has the task of preventing social disadvantage and therefore has a duty to intervene wherever these basic needs cannot be filled by the market alone.
The reactions of the so-called civil society to disadvantageous circumstances may make disadvantage visible. This is most obvious when non-governmental alternative organizations and projects are started by citizens in order to relieve the disadvantages. These could be individual citizens, social economic organizations, self-help groups, and social projects in general.

We emphasize at this point that this does not imply a normative or prescriptive definition of what should be classified as social disadvantage. A descriptive approach, which takes account of the overall social system and its mechanisms of legitimation, was chosen.
 
Also, on the descriptive level – based on this definition – diverse characteristics of people or groups of people can be described, as a consequence of which these people may be disadvantaged:

The results of empirical social research show that there are three main factors that have a stronger and more predictable effect on social standing and opportunities, and therefore potential disadvantage, than others: These factors are:
* Social class
* Gender
* Ethnicity and/or nationality 

Besides these, many other factors can also be important. The most often mentioned are physical and intellectual abilities, sexual orientation, age, religion and educational level (in strong correlation with social class). The list of potential factors that could contribute to social disadvantage can, however – since it depends on the dimension mentioned above, the society’s consensus on what represents the common good – never be complete, because factors that can cause disadvantage are always dependent on specific situations and issues.

The definition of aims is the heart of a PSPP. Because of this, all components of a PSPP (the interactions between the participating partner enterprises and organizations, the roles and functions in the partnership and the setting-up and practical implementation of the project) must be compatible with the specific set of aims defined by the partnership and must serve to realize these aims.
On the other hand, the route to realization of a specific, agreed goal and the structures that are set up to allow the project to be realized, should conform to the general definition of aims described here. This means that the structures and agreements of the partnership and the project process itself must be designed so that these also serve to improve the living situation of disadvantaged people as defined above.

===Roles and functions===
In a PSPP three main roles are exercised:
#'''Financing''' of the infrastructure for implementation of social products and services, i.e. Financing of development of social products and services
#'''Project Leadership''' i.e. research / analysis of needs, ideas, coordination from planning through set-up and operation
# '''Demand''': Assurance of cash flow by agreeing to buy the products and services

All three roles can be done by different partners. But in the different sectors involved (state, social economy, private enterprise) each has its own interests and areas of competence, so that they will naturally have different interests and priorities as to the roles they wish to play in the partnership.

===Preconditions for a PSPP===
Building on the previous remarks on the PPP concept and the related quality model PSPP, we can posit as a precondition for the step from a PPP to a PSPP the willingness of all parties involved to define / accept only solutions, aims and agendas that will have mid- to long-term character. (By this we do not mean that the products of the partnership could only be generated in the mid- to long-term; this is not the same thing). This applies both to the goals themselves and also in the sense that conditions should be created that make it possible for the products of the partnership to have a lasting effect.
This condition, arises, in contrast to a PPP, from the fact that the agendas of a PSPP are tasks and aims of the state (common good / welfare) that do not obey the laws of supply and demand. These goals and contents lie instead in the delivery of an agreed level of common good to civil society. Such fundamental social agreements are central and necessary building blocks for a social peace based on security and justice, where citizens can rely on pre-agreed levels of state functions and can set up their lives accordingly. This is a precondition for preventing people from being disadvantaged or finding themselves in living situations that tend towards them becoming disadvantaged.
In this way, “mid-term” PSPPs can be defined as those that have a similar lifetime to the electoral cycles of municipalities and states; any that take place on a longer time base can be called long-term (quantitatively), and can be seen as (qualitatively) supporting the long-term assurance of state supports promised in constitutions and municipal statutes.

===Order of events===
The starting point of a PSPP is a recognition by a social enterprise of a social problem (e.g. an organization working with disabled people realizes that many people with disabilities in rural areas are faced with a problem of distance between their homes and workplaces). An idea is formed about how this problem could be solved, and the social enterprise develops a concept – drawing on their long experience and expertise in the area – for a social service, for which some infrastructure needs to be set up (e.g. sheltered accommodation close to the workplace, in which various needs, depending on gender, age or cultural background, can be catered for). In order to be able to realize the project, the social enterprise approaches a partner enterprise that could supply the necessary finance (e.g. a local bank) and brings in a state agency that has an interest in the project being done (e.g. the local social service responsible for people with disabilities, or the regional social department). This ensures the cash flow by buying the social service and makes possible a more economical financing by the commercial partner. 
The social enterprise then plans the execution of the project, sets up if necessary a legal vehicle for the project, sets up the necessary infrastructure (builds the sheltered housing project) and realizes &amp; runs the social service (the support of the inhabitants).
In this example, the order of events and some division of roles is already evident. The phases of a PSPP can be summarized again as follows:

# '''Needs analysis''' 
In the needs analysis, factors that cause and/or reinforce disadvantage are researched and analysed. 
#'''Idea''' 
#'''Development of social products and services'''
#'''Setting-up of the financing partnership''' with state and commercial organizations
#'''Planning''' of the practical implementation
#'''Setting-up''' of the infrastructure or other preparations for realizing the products / services
#'''Implementation''': Operation of the infrastructure and provision of the social services / supply of the social products

===Financing===
The classification of the models is based on PPP models, since forms of cooperation between two partners can be taken as a starting point for forms involving three partners. The description above thus includes the models to be found in PPP practice, with the exception of the company management (Betriebsführung) and company transfer (Betriebsüberlassung) models, since in these no positive effects are to be expected if a third partner were brought in, and these forms exhibit the lowest efficiency gains of all PPPs.

Financing instruments as additional elements of PSPP:
* [[Factoring (finance)|Factoring]]
The starting point of (true) factoring is a long-term contractual arrangement between the municipality and a private person, on the basis of which the private person provides a public service. Due to the assured flow of payments (payment according to time) this model could in principle be considered for all PSPPs. The factoring consists in the further stage in which the private operator / owner sells a part of the future income from the contract with the state at cash value (minus a commission) to a factoring institute and uses the price to finance the project, so that only a low level of owner’s equity is needed. (see  Kirchhoff 1995). This is especially useful for medium-sized enterprises, in order to compete with the strongly capitalized large corporations. 
* Municipality Guarantee
In addition to the factoring by the private partner, it is not uncommon to further optimise the financing costs in PSPP by adding a guarantee given by the municipality / state authority to the other forms of security provided for loans.
* Silent partnership
Silent partnerships involve a limited-term raising of capital by bringing in a silent partner, who normally comes in simply for the dividend. (see Kirchhoff 1995). 
* Public financing aids
In certain models for communal social economic purposes, public financing aids in the form of reduced-interest loans or investment grants can be availed of in addition to private-sector capital and equity. The EU, the federal republic and the provinces offer grants for research, planning and implementation of communal social investments.
* Sponsoring 
Sponsoring is essentially an exchange transaction (see Arnold, Maelicke 2003). The sponsor pays the sponsored organization in the form of money, in kind, or services. In return the sponsor acquires certain rights to advertise its involvement. It therefore uses the sponsored organization as an element of its advertising strategy. Both sides ought to derive benefit from the exchange.
A further constitutive feature of sponsoring is the contractual definition of the quid pro quo. Both parties must clearly understand their contractual obligations. A written contract is not mandatory, but is much to be recommended.
* Social Bonds
Another possible financing method is the issuing of bonds. Investors can take out a bond with a reduced interest rate and in this way make an indirect donation to PSPP projects. Compared with typical bond schemes, whose interest levels are coupled to the credit rating of the company, and have minimum volume limits of approximately € 50 million (or € 5 million in the case of the new mid cap bonds), social bonds, with the waiver of a part of the interest by the investors, have definite advantages for social enterprises. A successful example is the “ELAG SOCIAL bond“ (ELAG=Elisabeth Liegenschafts-Entwicklungs-Aktiengesellschaft, Elisabeth Real Estate Development Stock Corporation). This stock company formed by the Caritas of the [[diocese of Linz]] and the KOOP Lebensraum Beteiligungs-AG has used the bond issue to ensure compliance with its investment rules, which specify low-risk investment, charitable-social purpose and investment in properties that should yield dividends not less than the rate of inflation.

===Description of various PSPP models===

====Service models====
* Complex contracting-out
Contracting-out generally means hiving off organizational units as private entities and/or purchase of services from private providers under the state contracting/tendering rules. This is the state equivalent of the already well-established trend in commercial business of outsourcing in order to concentrate on one’s core competence (see Müller, Prankebenberg 1997).

====Special financing forms====
* [[Leasing]] and fund leasing
The minimal specifications of PPP as regards communal leasing mean that not all leasing activities of municipalities qualify for the title of PPPs. Especially, much product leasing, such as simple leasing of equipment without services, does not fall under the definition of PPP. The leasing variants that qualify as a form of PPP are those in which an investor chosen by competitive bidding supplies more than the mere provision of financing, e.g. by providing complementary services and taking on additional practical tasks. The private partner in such cases is responsible for major pieces of implementation of a project. (see Höftmann 2001). 
* Concession model
Concession models are similar to leasing models conceptually and in terms of the applicable accounting rules, but all the restrictions of leasing, particularly problems of tax and property law, are avoided. At the centre of the model is the waiver of preferential tax treatment both on the part of the project leader and the finance provider, so that in the concession model no savings can be made on the basis of taxation technicalities. The less stringent conditions for setting up such a vehicle thus have their price and are reflected in higher annual rates of rent compared to leasing (see Scheele 1993).

====Provider model====
* Provider Model
The basic idea of a provider model is that the municipality hands over the fulfilment of its statutory tasks to a private provider in such a way that the complete task is temporarily outsourced. The municipality private capital and expertise is brought into a project during the setting-up and operational phases, without the private partner acquiring shares in the operating company – effectively a form of limited-term privatisation (see Rudolph, Büscher 1995). 
* BOT Model ([[Build-Operate-Transfer]])
Since the operator models with a lifetime of 20–30 years are long-term arrangements and a premature transfer back to the municipality is not possible, BOT (build, operate, transfer) models with a lifetime of three to ten years have been developed as a shorter-term variant. (see Kirchoff 1997). These are basically transitional solutions with private-sector planning and setting-up as well as temporary private-sector operation in the relatively risk-intensive early years, so that BOT models could be called short-term operator models (see Höftmann 2001).
* Cooperation model
The basic idea of a cooperation model is the setting-up of a private legal entity, in which both the municipality and at least one private enterprise hold shares either directly or indirectly (through an intermediate holding company). This type of mixed municipal/private, or semi-state ownership has been in common use for about 100 years, especially in utilities with a local monopoly on provision (see Hering, Matschke 1997).

===Limits and risks===
PSPPs offer not only opportunities but also bring risks, especially for the state partner (and their budget). Entry into a PSPP on the part of the state is based on the expectation that additional resources can be generated or mobilized in order to increase the scope of public social services.
Due to the responsibilities of the state, the state partner must carefully evaluate what is made the subject of a PSPP – with whom, for how long and under what conditions. Long-term effects must be anticipated. The evaluation process needs comprehensive, long-term and operational criteria, quality assurance, a political decision and a critical analysis of the PSPP as to its suitability as an instrument for the intended purpose. For public institutions, a PSPP can increase the room for manoeuvre, but this process must not take place at the expense of erosion or abdication of responsibility by the state authority. 
The state must be careful not to surrender control of activities over which it is democratically mandated to exercise adequate control. This issue is the subject of extensive discussions as it applies to PPPs: the growing influence of private actors and the correspondingly retreating influence of the state (see e.g. B. Pölzl/Preisch 2003: 41).
This makes it all the more important to emphasize that PSPP models should only be supported by the state in cases where they serve the long-term social needs of disadvantaged members of society. This responsibility belongs to the state and the state only.

To reap the full benefits of a PSPP for all involved parties, it must be ensured that the clear definition of social aims and partnership process on the one hand is not outweighed by the impetus to generate and mobilize resources and finance on the other hand. It is essential for the implementation of a PSPP to preserve the partnership throughout. This means that the autonomy of the social economic partners must be protected and they must not be brought into a position of such dependency by entering a PSPP that their autonomy is sacrificed or weakened. 

Since public goals and agendas can be matched to mid- and long-term solutions by using PSPPs, a qualitative approach can be used. 

Some concern about the quality of the services that are provided in the course of PPPs exists both in public opinion and among some representatives of the state sector. The specification of a PSPP in terms of the social aims (in contrast to PPPs) is a positive quality factor. Due to the orientation of the model according to these aims and the resulting processes and conditions (needs analysis and product development by experts working in the social sector, partnership principles, etc.), the model places great emphasis on the quality of implementation of the PSPP. Nonetheless, it must be said that the quality of the social products and services produced  will always be the responsibility of 
* the people and organizations who have the decision-making competence in development and implementation of the social products and services;
* the internal project controlling;
* and the enterprises and organizations that control all the relevant aspects of the environment in which the project takes place (financing, regulation of activities, etc.) through the partnership negotiation process; this requires responsible and serious behaviour not only on the part of the private and social-economic actors but also crucially on the part of the state representatives.

===Prospects: opportunities and potential===
If the conditions for when a PSPP should be used, and the quality criteria, are respected, a PSPP can be of great benefit for the social target group it aims to help as well as for the participating organizations and enterprises.

In a PSPP, needs of disadvantaged people or groups of people that have been previously neglected can be met, or the spectrum of services available to them can be expanded. Private enterprises are usually strongly oriented towards meeting customer (consumer) demands. In a PSPP this also applies to the social enterprises, which in contrast to non-social economic enterprises and organizations exhibit a stronger responsiveness towards the needs of their clients.

The solutions developed in a PSPP can also be offered on a mid- to long-term basis and thus contribute to a sustainable establishment of new activities and structural change.

For private or social economic enterprises / organizations, the participation in a PSPP offers an expansion of their fields of business and the opportunity to become active in already established and newly developed fields as competent partners. Social economic organizations or enterprises gain an opportunity to make necessary longer-term investments which would not be possible in a conventional working relationship with the state (i.e. by simple buying of services by the state).

On the other hand, the state can make use of the specialist expertise of the social economic and private companies. This should allow all the participants to concentrate on their core competences. The state can gain an opportunity to do the tasks it is responsible for efficiently, cost-effectively and without delays due to budgetary bottlenecks.

In addition to the special benefits for disadvantaged people, the positive effects of “classical” PPPs apply (Pölzl/Preisch 2003):
* Exploitation of synergy effects through mutual sharing of information and capabilities
* Opening up of new ways of financing investments
* Goal-oriented division of tasks and functions results in increased efficiency
* The previous two points, taken together, result in time savings
* Smaller risks for individual participants through sharing of risks

The opportunities offered by PSPPs can be exploited best when the participating organizations can avail of the necessary know-how in the form of accompanying consulting and support by appropriate professionals. In Austria, even PPP is still a relatively new phenomenon – in contrast to Germany, neither a national “PPP Facilitation Act” nor PPP Task Forces to ensure professional setting up of PPPs. The expansion of the PPP concept by adding the qualitative aspect of the explicit social aims is even more dependent on competent support to implement the relatively complex projects with good quality and successfully. Not only purely private/commercial approaches on the one hand need and public administration principles, rules and procedures on the other hand need to be dealt with, but also the competences needed for the social service elements need to be fitted together suitably.

From the point of view of social policy, PSPPs, if the procedure described is followed and needs analysis is done by social economic organizations and enterprises working in the field, can open up new fields of activity, not only for the social and private enterprises but also for the state. PSPPs are a chance for development of social services not as a purely top-down process (in which the state formulates the needs and contracts the corresponding works) but that needs can be recognized and formulated by agents and organizations of civil society and these can be met in cooperation with the state. To make use of this chance, the state must be flexible and open to innovation and the political and legal environment must be compatible with this bottom-up approach. Many established social phenomena, e.g. the Red Cross movement or the women’s emancipation movement, began in the private or civil-society spheres and were later picked up and supported by the state; and through state support, their development was importantly influenced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11958">The '''Pyongyang Declaration''', officially titled '''Let Us Defend and Advance the Cause of Socialism''' was a statement signed by a number of parties on April 20, 1992. Representatives of 70 communist and other parties had come to Pyongyang for the [[Public holidays in North Korea|celebration]] of [[Kim Il-sung]]'s 80th birthday. While there, the delegates had many bilateral and multilateral contacts with each other and decided to issue a declaration reiterating their commitment to socialism in spite of the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the USSR]] and a [[Fall of Communism|number of other communist regimes]] in recent years. On April 20 the declaration was signed by delegates of 70 parties, including 48 party leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ml-review.ca/aml/AllianceIssues/AppendicesFinal.html Alliance 19; April 1996, The Path to a New Communist, Marxist -Leninist International Appendix 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Text ==
The following translation of the Pyongyang Declaration appeared in ''Proletarian'' #18 (June 2007):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpgb-ml.org/index.php?secName=proletarian&amp;subName=display&amp;art=286 CPGB-ML signs up to Pyongyang Declaration]&lt;/ref&gt;

The representatives of political parties from different countries of the world who are striving for the victory of socialism publish this declaration with a firm conviction to defend and advance the socialist cause.

Ours is an era of independence and the socialist cause is a sacred one aimed at realising the independence of the popular masses.

Socialism suffered a setback in some countries in recent years. As a consequence of this, the imperialists and reactionaries are claiming that socialism has ‘come to an end’. This is nothing but a sophistry to beautify and embellish capitalism and patronise the old order.

The setback of socialism and the revival of capitalism in some countries is causing a great loss to the achievement of the socialist cause, but it can never be interpreted as the denial of the superiority of socialism and of the reactionary character or capitalism.

Socialism has long been the ideal of mankind and it represents the future of mankind.

Socialist society is, in essence, a genuine society for the people where the popular masses are the masters of everything and everything serves them.

But the capitalist society is an unfair one where ‘the rich get ever richer and the poor poorer’. In this society money decides everything, exploitation of man by man predominates and a handful of exploiter classes lord it over all. It is inevitably accompanied by political non-rights, unemployment, poverty, drugs, crimes and other kinds of all social evils which trample human dignity underfoot.

Only socialism can eliminate domination, subjugation and social inequality of all kinds and ensure the people substantial freedom, equality, true democracy and human rights.

The popular masses have long carried on an arduous struggle for the victory of socialism and shed much blood in this course.

The path of socialism is an untrodden one and, therefore, the advance of socialism is inevitably accompanied by trials and difficulties.
One of the reasons for the unsuccessful construction of socialism in some countries is that they failed to build a social structure conforming to the fundamental requirements of the popular masses and build socialism suited to the demand of the theory of scientific socialism.

The guarantee for the advance of a socialist society lies in that the popular masses become the genuine masters of the society.

Such a society makes a triumphant advance – this is a truth and reality proved by theory and practice.

The parties and progressive mankind aspiring after socialism have drawn a very precious lesson therefrom.

In order to defend and advance the socialist cause individual parties should firmly maintain independence and firmly build up their own forces.

The socialist movement is an independent one. Socialism is carved out and built with a country or national state as a unit. The socialist cause in each country should be fulfilled on the responsibility of the party and people of that country.

Each party should work out lines and policies which tally with the actual situation of the country where it is active and with the demands of its people and implement them by relying on the popular masses.

It should not abandon its revolutionary principles at any time and under any circumstances but uplift the banner of socialism.

The socialist cause is a national one and, at the same time, a common cause of mankind.

All parties should cement the ties of comradely unity, cooperation and solidarity on the principles of independence and equality.

Now that the imperialists and reactionaries are attacking socialism and people in an international collusion, the parties which are building socialism or aspiring after it should defend and advance socialism on an international scale and strengthen mutual support and solidarity in their efforts for social justice, democracy, the right to existence and peace against imperialist domination, subjugation by capital and neo-colonialism.

This is an international duty incumbent upon all parties and progressive forces for socialism and an undertaking for their own cause.

We will advance under the unfurled banner of socialism in firm unity with all progressive political parties, organisations, and peoples of the world who are striving to defend socialism against capitalism and imperialism.

Let us all fight it out to open up the future of mankind with a firm conviction in the cause of socialism.

Final victory is on the part of the people fighting in unity for socialism.

The socialist cause shall not perish.

== Later history ==

By the beginning of 1996 the Pyongyang Declaration was reportedly endorsed by "well over 200 parties and organizations in all parts of the world" including the (single member) 'Communist Organisation of Britain' and the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Britain (Marxist-Leninist)]].&lt;ref&gt;Communist Organisation of Britain [https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.ebbingtide/cob-ny96.pdf New Year Message for 1996] p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 17, 2000, the [[Korean Central News Agency]] ran a story "Pyongyang declaration's vitality increases" claiming that the number of parties endorsing the declaration rose to 170 within a year of its adoption and that 251 parties had signed it up to that date. It also said that there was a meeting in [[Moscow]] by "officials of progressive parties from more than 20 countries" to mark the fifth anniversary of the declaration and which issued a statement called "Let us advance under the uplifted banner of the Pyongyang declaration."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2000/200012/news12/17.htm#3 Pyongyang declaration's vitality increases] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908195204/http://kcna.co.jp/item/2000/200012/news12/17.htm |date=2017-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the tenth anniversary of the Declaration on April 20, 2002, the KCNA announced that it had been endorsed by 258 parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2002/200204/news04/20.htm Pyongyang declaration signed by 258 political parties ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012035117/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2002/200204/news04/20.htm |date=2014-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007 the [[Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist–Leninist)]] signed the declaration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpgb-ml.org/index.php?secName=proletarian&amp;subName=display&amp;art=286 CPGB-ML signs up to Pyongyang Declaration]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Security information management''' ('''SIM''') is an  [[information security]] industry term for the collection of data such as [[Logfile|log files]] into a central repository for trend analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stepping Through the InfoSec Program|author=J.L. Bayuk|page=97|year=2007|publisher=[[Information Systems Audit and Control Association|ISACA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
SIM products generally are software agents running on the computer systems that are to be monitored, which then send the log information to  a centralized server acting as a "security console". The console typically displays reports, charts, and graphs of that information, often in real time. Some software agents can incorporate local filters, to reduce and manipulate the data that they send to the server, although typically from a forensic point of view you would collect all audit and accounting logs to ensure you can recreate a security incident.

The security console is monitored by an administrator, who reviews the consolidated information, and takes action in response to any alerts issued.&lt;ref name=Wylder&gt;{{cite book|title=Strategic Information Security|author=John Wylder|page=172|publisher=CRC Press|year=2004|isbn=9780849320415}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Warrior /&gt;

The data that is sent to the server to be correlated and analyzed, are normalized by the software agents into a common form, usually [[XML]]. Those data are then aggregated, in order to reduce their overall size.&lt;ref name=Wylder /&gt;&lt;ref name=Warrior&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LILroPpCP0cC&amp;dq=Security+Warrior&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Security Warrior|author=Cyrus Peikari and Anton Chuvakin|pages=421&amp;ndash;422|publisher=O'Reilly|year=2004|isbn=9780596552398 |deadurl=no |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==

The terminology can easily be mistaken as a reference to the whole aspect of protecting one's infrastructure from any computer security breach. Due to historic reasons of terminology evolution; SIM refers to just the part of information security which consists of discovery of 'bad behavior' by using data collection techniques. The term commonly used to represent an entire security infrastructure that protects an environment is commonly called [[information security management]] (InfoSec).

Security information management is also referred to as log management and is different from SEM ([[security event manager|security event management]]), but makes up a portion of a [[SIEM]] (security information and event management) solution.&lt;ref&gt;http://securityinformationeventmanagement.com/ Understanding SIEM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://systeminformationandeventmanagement.ru&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://systeminformationandeventmanagement.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siem.su/ SIEM Analytics&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Security policy''' is a definition of what it means to ''be secure'' for a [[system]], organization or other entity.  For an organization, it addresses the constraints on behavior of its members as well as constraints imposed on adversaries by mechanisms such as doors, locks, keys and walls.  For systems, the security policy addresses constraints on functions and flow among them, constraints on access by external systems and adversaries including programs and access to data by people.  

==Significance==
If it is important to be secure, then it is important to be sure all of the security policy is enforced by mechanisms that are strong enough.  There are many organized methodologies and risk assessment strategies to assure completeness of security policies and assure that they are completely enforced.  In complex systems, such as [[information systems]], policies can be decomposed into sub-policies to facilitate the allocation of security mechanisms to enforce sub-policies.  However, this practice has pitfalls.  It is too easy to simply go directly to the sub-policies, which are essentially the rules of operation and dispense with the top level policy.  That gives the false sense that the rules of operation address some overall definition of security when they do not.  Because it is so difficult to think clearly with completeness about security, rules of operation stated as "sub-policies" with no "super-policy" usually turn out to be rambling rules that fail to enforce anything with completeness.  Consequently, a top-level security policy is essential to any serious security scheme and sub-policies and rules of operation are meaningless without it.

The term '''social criticism''' often refers to a mode of criticism that locates the reasons for malicious conditions in a society considered to be in a flawed [[social structure]]. It may also refer to people adhering to a social critic's aims at practical solutions by way of specific measures either for consensual [[reform]] or powerful [[revolution]].

== European roots ==
[[Religious persecution]] was common in Europe and was the reason for many physical and mental exoduses within the continent. Through such experiences, one of the first documents of social criticism was born: the [[Jean Meslier#Social Criticism|''Testament'' of Jean Meslier]].

== Protest experience with political theories==
Repression experienced by a [[minority group|minority]] often leads to [[protest]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Without sufficient resolution of the dispute, a social criticism can be formulated, often covered by political groups (political [[monopoly]]). For protesting people ''within'' a [[social movement]], it is often frustrating to [[experience]] failure of the movement and its own agenda.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The [[positivism dispute]] between [[critical rationalism]], e.g. between [[Karl Popper]] and  the [[Frankfurt School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D'Amico|first=Robert|date=1990-12-21|title=Karl Popper and the Frankfurt School|url=http://journal.telospress.com/content/1990/86/33|journal=Telos|language=en|volume=1990|issue=86|pages=33–48|doi=10.3817/1290086033|issn=0090-6514}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the academic form of the same discrepancy. This dispute deals with the question of whether research in the [[social sciences]] should be "neutral" or consciously adopt a partisan view.

==Academic forms==
Academic works of social criticism can belong to  [[social philosophy]], [[political economy]], [[sociology]], [[social psychology]], [[psychoanalysis]] but also [[cultural studies]] and other disciplines or reject academic forms of [[discourse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hhh.gavilan.edu/kwarren/LitCrit.html|title=Types of Literary Criticism|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature and music==
{{see also|Literary criticism}}
Social criticism can also be expressed in a fictional form, e.g. in a revolutionary novel like ''[[The Iron Heel]]'' by [[Jack London]] or in [[dystopia]]n [[novel]]s like  [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) or [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949) or [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1953), or [[Rafael Grugman]]'s ''[[Nontraditional Love]]'' (2008), [[children's books]] or films.

Fictional literature can have a significant social impact. For example, the 1852 novel ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] furthered the [[abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery movement]] in the United States, and the 1885 novel ''[[Ramona]]'', by [[Helen Hunt Jackson]], brought about changes in laws regarding [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Similarly, [[Upton Sinclair]]'s 1906 novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' helped create new laws related to public health and food handling, and [[Arthur Morrison]]'s 1896 novel ''A Child of the Jago'' caused England to change its housing laws. George Orwell and [[Charles Dickens]] wrote ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', respectively, to express their disillusionment with society and human nature. ''Animal Farm'', written in 1944, is a book that tells the animal fable of a farm in  which the farm animals revolt against their human masters. It is an  example of social criticism in literature in which Orwell satirized  the events in Russia after the [[Bolshevik Revolution]]. He anthropomorphises the animals, and alludes each one to a counterpart  in [[Russian history]]. ''A Tale of Two Cities'' also typifies this kind of literature. Besides the central theme of love, is another prevalent theme, that of a revolution gone bad. He shows us that, unfortunately, human nature causes us to be vengeful and, for some of us, overly ambitious. Both these books are similar in that both describe how, even with the best of intentions, our ambitions get the best of us. Both authors also demonstrate that violence and the [[Machiavellian]] attitude of "the ends justifying the means" are deplorable. They also express their authors' disenchantment with the state of evolution of human nature.

According to [[Frederick Douglass]], "Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe."&lt;ref&gt;From Douglass´ speech in 1886 on the 24th anniversary of Emancipation, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors imply, that even if we begin with honourable intentions, there will be some who will let their basic instincts take control. ''Animal Farm'' portrays this nature through parodying events in real history. Given the right conditions, these events could happen anywhere. Take for example, a leader becoming overly ambitious, to the point of harming his people for more power.

In ''A Tale of Two Cities'', Dickens examines the inner soul, and shares with us how people are driven to the valley of human emotions, where desperation and anger reign, and what could happen afterwards if we let these emotions build up inside. Every human being is capable of becoming a ruthless, opportunistic being like Napoleon or Madame Defarge, if placed in the right place, at the right time.

Social criticism is certainly present in opera ([[The Cradle Will Rock]], [[Trouble in Tahiti]]) and other types of classical music, such as the [[Symphony No. 13 (Shostakovich)|Symphony No.13]], called "[[Babi Yar]]", of [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]. Other musical expressions of social criticism are  frequent in [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[rap]] music, examples being [[Pretty Vacant|"Pretty Vacant"]] by [[Sex Pistols]] and [[Brenda's Got a Baby|"Brenda's Got a Baby"]] by [[2Pac]]. Heavy metal bands such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Metallica]] and [[Megadeth]] also use social criticism extensively, particularly in their earlier works.

==Background==
The original meaning was confined to systems in which the government operates health care facilities and employs health care professionals.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/57/S0525700.html|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210141328/http://www.bartleby.com/61/57/S0525700.html|archivedate=2009-02-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/so/socmed.html|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111064610/http://www.bartleby.com/65/so/socmed.html|archivedate=2007-11-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacob S.

The United States [[Veterans Health Administration]] and the medical departments of the [[Army Medical Department (United States)|U.S. Army]], [[Surgeon General of the United States Navy|Navy]], and [[Air Force Medical Service|Air Force]], would also fall under this narrow definition. When used in that way, the narrow definition permits a clear distinction from [[single-payer health care|single payer health insurance]] systems, in which the government finances health care but is not involved in care delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Single Payer article from AMSA |url=http://www.amsa.org/uhc/SinglePayer101.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024133141/http://www.amsa.org/uhc/SinglePayer101.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=25521|title=MedTerms medical dictionary|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930180758/http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=25521|archivedate=2007-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, American conservative critics of [[health care reform in the United States|health care reform]] have attempted to broaden the term by applying it to any publicly funded system. [[Medicare (Canada)|Canada's Medicare]] system and most of the UK's NHS [[general practitioner]] and [[dentistry|dental]] services, which are systems where health care is delivered by private business with partial or total government funding, fit the broader definition, as do the health care systems of most of Western Europe. In the United States, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], and the [[US military]]'s [[TRICARE]] fall under that definition. In specific regard to military benefits of a (currently) volunteer military, such care is an owed benefit to a specific group as part of an economic exchange, which muddies the definition yet further.

Most industrialized countries and many developing countries operate some form of publicly funded health care with universal coverage as the goal. According to the [[Institute of Medicine]] and others, the United States is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not provide [[universal health care]].&lt;ref name="IOM"&gt;[http://www.iom.edu/?id=17848 Insuring America's Health: Principles and Recommendations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818031109/http://www.iom.edu/?id=17848 |date=2007-08-18 }}, Institute of Medicine at the National Academies of Science, 2004-01-14, accessed 2007-10-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm|title=The Case for Universal Health Care in the United States|author=|date=|website=cthealth.server101.com|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423105127/http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm|archivedate=23 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Oberlander]], a professor of health policy at the [[University of North Carolina]], maintains that the term is merely a political pejorative that has been defined to mean different levels of government involvement in health care, depending on what the speaker was arguing against at the time.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16962482 Socialized Medicine Belittled on Campaign Trail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707232709/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16962482 |date=2017-07-07 }} from NPR.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is often used by conservatives in the U.S. to imply that the privately run health care system would become controlled by the government, thereby associating it with [[socialism]], which has negative connotations to some people in American political culture.&lt;ref name="MFriedman"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hillsdale.edu/hctools/imprimis_archive/2006/07/2006_07_Imprimis.pdf |title=Free to Choose: A Conversation with Milton Friedman |accessdate=2008-04-14 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530160511/http://www.hillsdale.edu/hctools/imprimis_archive/2006/07/2006_07_Imprimis.pdf |archivedate=May 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, its usage is controversial,&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; and at odds with the views of conservatives in other countries prepared to defend socialized medicine such as [[Margaret Thatcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinion.publicfinance.co.uk/2009/08/the-end-is-nye/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723184018/http://opinion.publicfinance.co.uk/2009/08/the-end-is-nye/ |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of term==
When the term "socialized medicine" first appeared in the United States in the early 1900s, it bore no negative connotations. Otto P. Geier, chairman of the Preventive Medicine Section of the [[American Medical Association]], was quoted in ''The New York Times'' in 1917 as praising socialized medicine as a way to "discover disease in its incipiency," help end "venereal diseases, alcoholism, tuberculosis," and "make a fundamental contribution to social welfare."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/07/01/96251567.pdf |title=World at War is Facing a Shortage of Doctors|accessdate=2009-04-02 |date=1917-07-01 |work= |publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by the 1930s, the term socialized medicine was routinely used negatively by [[American conservatism|conservative]] opponents of [[publicly funded health care]] who wished to imply it represented socialism, and by extension, communism.&lt;ref name="Slate history lesson"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2175477 |title=Who's Afraid of Socialized Medicine?

Roosevelt]] later championed it, as did [[Harry S.

Truman Library and Museum&lt;/ref&gt; and many others. Truman announced before describing his proposal that: "This is not socialized medicine".&lt;ref name="Slate history lesson"/&gt;

Government involvement in health care was ardently opposed by the AMA, which distributed posters to doctors with slogans such as "Socialized medicine&amp;nbsp;... will undermine the democratic form of government."&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Garceau, "Organized Medicine Enforces its 'Party Line'", Public Opinion Quarterly, September 1940, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; According to T.R. Reid (''The Healing of America'', 2009): &lt;blockquote&gt;The term ["socialized medicine"] was popularized by the public relations firm [[Whitaker and Baxter]] working for the American Medical Association in 1947 to disparage President Truman's proposal for a national health care system. It was a label, at the dawn of the [[cold war]], meant to suggest that anybody advocating universal access to health care must be a communist. And the phrase has retained its political power for six decades.&lt;ref name="T.R. Reid, 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The AMA conducted a nationwide campaign called [[Operation Coffee Cup]] during the late 1950s and early 1960s in opposition to the Democrats' plans to extend [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] to include health insurance for the elderly, later known as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]. As part of the plan, doctors' wives would organize coffee meetings in an attempt to convince acquaintances to write letters to Congress opposing the program.&lt;ref name=OCC&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/16/magazine/16SOCIAL.html| title=A Question of Numbers| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| author=Roger Lowenstein| date=2009-07-27| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331144728/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/16/magazine/16SOCIAL.html| archivedate=2014-03-31| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, [[Ronald Reagan]] recorded a disc entitled ''[[Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine]]'' warning its audience the "dangers" that socialized medicine could bring.

[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] are forms of [[publicly funded health care]], which fits the looser definition of socialized medicine.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Part B coverage (Medical) requires a monthly premium of $96.40 (and possibly higher) and the first $135 of costs per year also fall to the senior, not the government.&lt;ref&gt;http://questions.medicare.gov/cgi-bin/medicare.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=2100 Medicare rates&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll released in February 2008, conducted by the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] and [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Interactive]], indicated that Americans are currently divided in their opinions of socialized medicine, and this split correlates strongly with their political party affiliation.&lt;ref name="Harvard School of Public Health"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Poll Finds Americans Split by Political Party Over Whether Socialized Medicine Better or Worse Than Current System |publisher=Harvard School of Public Health |date=2007-02-14 |url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2008-releases/poll-americans-split-by-political-party-over-socialized-medicine.html |accessdate=2008-02-27 |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217230522/http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2008-releases/poll-americans-split-by-political-party-over-socialized-medicine.html |archivedate=2008-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two thirds of those polled said they understood the term "socialized medicine" very well or somewhat well.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} When offered descriptions of what such a system could mean, strong majorities believed that it means "the government makes sure everyone has health insurance" (79%) and "the government pays most of the cost of health care" (73%). One third (32%) felt that socialized medicine is a system in which "the government tells doctors what to do."{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The poll showed "striking differences" by party affiliation. Among Republicans polled, 70% said that socialized medicine would be worse than the current system. The same percentage of Democrats (70%) said that a socialized medical system would be better than the current system. Independents were more evenly split, with 43% saying socialized medicine would be better and 38% worse.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

According to Robert J. Blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health, "The phrase 'socialized medicine' really resonates as a pejorative with Republicans. However, that so many Democrats believe that socialized medicine would be an improvement is an indication of their dissatisfaction with our current system." Physicians' opinions have become more favorable toward "socialized medicine."&lt;ref name="Harvard School of Public Health"/&gt;

A 2008 survey of doctors, published in ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'', shows that physicians support universal health care and national health insurance by almost 2 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSN3143203520080331?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=healthNews&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true Doctors support universal health care: survey], Reuters, March 31, 2008 (first reported in Annals of Internal Medicine).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political controversies in the United States==
{{See also|Health care economics}}
{{Debate|date=January 2011}}

Although the marginal scope of free or subsidized medicine provided is much discussed within the political body in most countries with socialized health care systems, there is little or no evidence of strong public pressure for the removal of subsidies or the privatization of health care in those countries. The political distaste for government involvement in health care in the U.S. is a unique counter to the trend found in other developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}{{Dubious|date=September 2009}}

In the United States, neither of the main parties favors a socialized system that puts the government in charge of hospitals or doctors, but they do have different approaches to financing and access. Democrats tend to be favorably inclined towards reform that involves more government control over health care financing and citizens' right of access to health care. Republicans are broadly in favor of the status quo, or a reform of the financing system that gives more power to the citizen, often through tax credits.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Supporters of government involvement in health care argue that government involvement ensures access, quality, and addresses [[market failure]]s&lt;ref&gt;Office of Health Economics (UK), [http://www.oheschools.org/ohe.pdf The Economics of Health Care] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530154951/http://www.oheschools.org/ohe.pdf |date=2008-05-30 }}, Section 3.i, "Market Failure: an Overview," p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; specific to the health care markets.

While it uses the U.S. system as a case study, it's used to illustrate certain issues for a predominately British audience.

Opponents also claim that the absence of a market mechanism may slow innovation in treatment and research.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Both sides have also looked to more philosophical arguments, debating whether people have a fundamental [[Rights|right]] to have health care provided to them by their government.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===Cost of care===
Socialized medicine amongst industrialized countries tends to be more affordable than in systems where there is little government involvement. A 2003 study examined costs and outputs in the U.S. and other industrialized countries and broadly concluded that the U.S. spends so much because its health care system is more costly. It noted that "the United States spent considerably more on health care than any other country&amp;nbsp;... [yet] most measures of aggregate utilization such as physician visits per capita and hospital days per capita were below the OECD median. Since spending is a product of both the goods and services used and their prices, this implies that much higher prices are paid in the United States than in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Gerard F. |last2=Reinhardt |first2=Uwe E. |last3=Hussey |first3=Peter S. |last4=Petrosyan |first4=Varduhi |title=It's the prices, stupid: why the United States is so different from other countries |journal=Health Affairs |date=May 2003 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=89–105 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.22.3.89|doi-access=free |pmid=12757275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers examined possible reasons and concluded that input costs were high (salaries, cost of pharmaceutical), and that the complex payment system in the U.S. added higher administrative costs. Comparison countries in Canada and Europe were much more willing to exert [[monopsony]] power to drive down prices, whilst the highly fragmented buy side of the U.S. health system was one factor that could explain the relatively high prices in the United States of America.  The current [[fee-for-service]] payment system also stimulates expensive care by promoting procedures over visits through financially rewarding the former ($1,500 – for doing a 10-minute procedure) vs. the latter ($50 – for a 30–45 minute visit).{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} This causes the proliferation of specialists (more expensive care) and creating, what [[Donald Berwick|Don Berwick]] refers to as, "the world's best healthcare system for rescue care".{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Other studies have found no consistent and systematic relationship between the type of financing of health care and cost containment; the efficiency of operation of the health care system itself appears to depend much more on how providers are paid and how the delivery of care is organized than on the method used to raise these funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink1=Sherry Glied |first=Sherry A. |last=Glied |title=Health Care Financing, Efficiency, and Equity |date=March 2008 |work=NBER Working Paper No. 13881 |doi=10.3386/w13881 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some supporters argue that government involvement in health care would reduce costs not just because of the exercise of monopsony power, e.g. in drug purchasing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnhp.org/facts/singlepayer_faq.php#drug_prices|title=Single Payer FAQ - Physicians for a National Health Program|author=|date=|website=pnhp.org|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026121131/http://www.pnhp.org/facts/singlepayer_faq.php#drug_prices|archivedate=26 October 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also because it eliminates profit margins and administrative overhead associated with private insurance, and because it can make use of [[economies of scale]] in administration.  In certain circumstances, a volume purchaser may be able to guarantee sufficient volume to reduce overall prices while providing greater profitability to the seller, such as in so-called "[[Advance market commitments|purchase commitment]]" programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Löfgren |first1=Hans |title=Purchase commitments: Big business bias or solution to the ‘neglected diseases’ dilemma? |journal=Australian Review of Public Affairs |date=31 October 2005 |url=http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2005/10/lofgren.html |accessdate=2018-04-27 |issn=1832-1526|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422072411/http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2005/10/lofgren.html|archivedate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=June 2008}} Economist [[Arnold Kling]] attributes the present cost crisis mainly to the practice of what he calls ''premium medicine'', which overuses expensive forms of technology that is of marginal or no proven benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Arnold S. |last=Relman |title=Book Review: ''Crisis of Abundance: Rethinking How We Pay for Health Care'' |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=355 |issue= |pages=1073–1074 |date=2006 |doi=10.1056/NEJMbkrev57033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Milton Friedman]] has argued that government has weak incentives to reduce costs because "nobody spends somebody else’s money as wisely or as frugally as he spends his own".&lt;ref name="How to Cure Health Care"&gt;Milton Friedman, [http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3459466.html How to Cure Health Care] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426072208/http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3459466.html |date=2008-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others contend that health care consumption is not like other consumer consumption. Firstly there is a negative utility of consumption (consuming more health care does not make one better off) and secondly there is an [[information asymmetry]] between consumer and supplier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blomqvist |first=Åke |last2=Léger |first2=Pierre Thomas |year=2005 |title=Information asymmetry, insurance and the decision to hospitalize |journal=[[Journal of Health Economics]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=775–93 |doi=10.1016/j.jhealeco.2004.12.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Krugman]] and [[Robin Wells (economist)|Robin Wells]] argue that all of the evidence indicates that public insurance of the kind available in several European countries achieves equal or better results at much lower cost, a conclusion that also applies within the United States. In terms of actual administrative costs, Medicare spent less than 2% of its resources on administration, while private insurance companies spent more than 13%.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman and Robin Wells, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18802 "The Health Care Crisis and What to Do About It"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627092738/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18802 |date=2007-06-27 }}, The New York Review of Books, Volume 53, Number 5, March 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cato Institute]] argues that the 2% Medicare cost figure ignores all costs shifted to doctors and hospitals, and alleges that Medicare is not very efficient at all when those costs are incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=John Goodman | title=Five Myths of Socialized Medicine | work=[[Cato Institute]] | date=Winter 2005 | url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/catosletter/catosletterv3n1.pdf | format=PDF | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230100531/https://www.cato.org/pubs/catosletter/catosletterv3n1.pdf | archivedate=2006-12-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have found that the U.S. wastes more on bureaucracy (compared to the Canadian level), and that this excess administrative cost would be sufficient to provide health care to the uninsured population in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of New England Journal of Medicine Study, [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8800.php USA wastes more on health care bureaucracy than it would cost to provide health care to all of the uninsured] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223201811/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8800.php |date=2008-02-23 }}, Medical News Today, 28 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding the arguments about Medicare, there is overall less bureaucracy in socialized systems than in the present mixed U.S. system. Spending on administration in Finland is 2.1% of all health care costs, and in the UK the figure is 3.3% whereas the U.S. spends 7.3% of all expenditures on administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Figure 14.

===Quality of care===
Some in the U.S. claim that socialized medicine would reduce health care quality. The quantitative evidence for this claim is not clear. The WHO has used Disability Adjusted Life Expectancy (the number of years an average person can expect to live in good health) as a measure of a nation's health achievement, and has ranked its member nations by this measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718144538/http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }} WHO. World Health Report 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. ranking was 24th, worse than similar industrial countries with high public funding of health such as Canada (ranked 5th), the UK (12th), Sweden (4th), France (3rd) and Japan (1st). But the U.S. ranking was better than some other European countries such as Ireland, Denmark and Portugal, which came 27th, 28th and 29th respectively. Finland, with its relatively high death rate from guns and renowned high suicide rate came above the U.S. in 20th place. The British have a [[Care Quality Commission]] that commissions independent surveys of the quality of care given in its health institutions and these are publicly accessible over the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhssurveys.org|title=NHS Surveys :: Focused on patients' experience :: Home|author=|date=|website=www.nhssurveys.org|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307201512/http://nhssurveys.org/|archivedate=7 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These determine whether health organizations are meeting public standards for quality set by government and allows regional comparisons. Whether these results indicate a better or worse situation to that in other countries such as the U.S. is hard to tell because these countries tend to lack a similar set of standards.

Opponents claim that socialized medicine would require higher taxes but international comparisons do not support this; the ratio of public to private spending on health is lower in the U.S. than that of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, or any EU country, yet the per capita tax funding of health in those countries is already lower than that of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_20072008_EN_Indicator_tables.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226204118/http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr_20072008_en_indicator_tables.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-26 |df= }} UN Human Development Report 2007/2008 Table 6 Page 247&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxation is not necessarily an unpopular form of funding for health care. In England, a survey for the [[British Medical Association]] of the general public showed overwhelming support for the tax funding of health care. Nine out of ten people agreed or strongly agreed with a statement that the NHS should be funded from taxation with care being free at the point of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/AttachmentsByTitle/PDFnhssystreform2007/$FILE/48751Surveynhsreform.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227150902/http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/AttachmentsByTitle/PDFnhssystreform2007/%24FILE/48751Surveynhsreform.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-27 |df= }} Survey of the general public’s views on NHS system reform - in England: BMA June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[opinion piece]] in ''The Wall Street Journal'' by two conservative Republicans argues that government sponsored health care will legitimatize support for government services generally, and make an activist government acceptable. "Once a large number of citizens get their health care from the state, it dramatically alters their attachment to government. Every time a tax cut is proposed, the guardians of the new medical-welfare state will argue that tax cuts would come at the expense of health care -- an argument that would resonate with middle-class families entirely dependent on the government for access to doctors and hospitals."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123207075026188601 Beware of the Big-Government Tipping Point] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120205305/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123207075026188601 |date=2018-01-20 }}, [[Peter Wehner]] and Paul Ryan, The Wall Street Journal, January 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovation===
Some in the U.S. argue that if government were to use its size to bargain down health care prices, this would undermine American leadership in medical innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler Cowen, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/05/business/05scene.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin "Poor U.S. Scores in Health Care Don’t Measure Nobels and Innovation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708213302/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/05/business/05scene.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin |date=2011-07-08 }}, ''The New York Times'', October 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julie Chan, [http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=4664 "We're Number 37 in Health Care!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411014948/http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=4664 |date=2008-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that the high level of spending in the U.S. health care system and its tolerance of waste is actually beneficial because it underpins American leadership in medical innovation, which is crucial not just for Americans, but for the entire world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Kling   | first = Arnold   | author-link = Arnold Kling  | title = Two health-care documentaries | periodical = The Washington Times   | date = June 30, 2007   | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others point out that the American health care system spends more on state-of-the-art treatment for people who have good insurance, and spending is reduced on those lacking it&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman, Robin Wells, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18802 "The Health Care Crisis and What to Do About It"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627092738/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18802 |date=2007-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and question the costs and benefits of some medical innovations, noting, for example, that "rising spending on new medical technologies designed to address heart disease has not meant that more patients have survived."&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Mahar, [http://alternet.org/story/81142/?page=1 The Mythology of Boomers Bankrupting Our Healthcare System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214142005/http://www.alternet.org/story/81142/?page=1 |date=2009-02-14 }}, Health Beat, April 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access===
One of the goals of socialized medicine systems is ensuring universal access to health care. Opponents of socialized medicine say that access for low-income individuals can be achieved by means other than socialized medicine, for example, income-related subsidies can function without public provision of either insurance or medical services. Economist [[Milton Friedman]] said the role of the government in health care should be restricted to financing hard cases.&lt;ref name="How to Cure Health Care"/&gt; Universal coverage can also be achieved by making purchase of insurance compulsory. For example, European countries with socialized medicine in the broader sense, such as [[Healthcare in Germany|Germany]] and [[Health care in the Netherlands|The Netherlands]], operate in this way. A legal obligation to purchase health insurance is akin to a mandated health tax, and the use of public subsidies is a form of directed [[income redistribution]] via the tax system{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. Such systems give the consumer a free choice amongst competing insurers whilst achieving universality to a government directed minimum standard.

Compulsory health insurance or savings are not limited to so-called socialized medicine, however. Singapore's health care system, which is often referred to as a [[free-market]] or [[Mixed economy|mixed]] system, makes use of a combination of compulsory participation and state price controls to achieve the same goals.&lt;ref name="Watson Wyatt Singapore"&gt;John Tucci, [http://www.watsonwyatt.com/europe/pubs/healthcare/render2.asp?ID=13850 "The Singapore health system – achieving positive health outcomes with low expenditure"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121210052940/http://www.watsonwyatt.com/europe/pubs/healthcare/render2.asp?ID=13850 |date=2012-12-10 }}, Watson Wyatt Healthcare Market Review, October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationing (access, coverage, price, and time)===
{{See also|Healthcare rationing in the United States}}

Part of the current debate about [[health care in the United States]] revolves around whether the [[Affordable Care Act]] as part of [[health care reform in the United States|health care reform]] will result in a more systematic and logical allocation of health care. Opponents tend to believe that the law will eventually result in a government takeover of health care and ultimately to socialized medicine and rationing based not on being able to afford the care you want but on whether a third party other than the patient and the doctor decides whether the procedure or the cost is justifiable. Supporters of reform point out that health care rationing already exists in the United States through insurance companies either denying coverage for [[pre-existing condition]]s or applying differential pricing for this coverage, or issuing denial for reimbursement on the grounds that the insurance company believes the procedure is [[Medical research|experimental]] or will not assist even though the doctor has recommended it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kmbc.com/r/6882159/detail.html Man Dies After Insurance Co.

Opponents of reform invoke the term socialized medicine because they say it will lead to health care rationing by denial of coverage, denial of access, and use of waiting lists, but often do so without acknowledging coverage denial, lack of access and waiting lists exist in the U.S. health care system currently&lt;ref&gt;"95,000+ U.S. patients are currently waiting for an organ transplant; nearly 4,000 new patients are added to the waiting list each month. Every day, 17 people die while waiting for a transplant of a vital organ, such as a heart, liver, kidney, pancreas, lung or bone marrow. Because of the lack of available donors in this country, 3,916 kidney patients, 1,570 liver patients, 356 heart patients and 245 lung patients died in 2006 while waiting for life-saving organ transplants:National Kidney Foundation http://www.kidney.org/news/newsroom/fs_new/25factsorgdon&amp;trans.cfm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711030138/http://www.kidney.org/news/newsroom/fs_new/25factsorgdon%26trans.cfm |date=2009-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or that waiting lists in the U.S. are sometimes longer than the waiting lists in countries with socialized medicine.&lt;ref&gt;"Right now more than 8,000 people in the UK need an organ transplant that could save or improve their life. But each year around 400 people die while waiting for a transplant". National Kidney Federation. {{cite web |url=http://www.kidney.org.uk/donor.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223044349/http://www.kidney.org.uk/donor.html |archivedate=2010-02-23 |df= }}. (Note: The UK population is about one sixth the size of the U.S. population).&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the reform proposal point out a public insurer is not akin to a socialized medicine system because it will have to negotiate rates with the medical industry just as other insurers do and cover its cost with premiums charged to policyholders just as other insurers do without any form of subsidy.

There is a frequent misunderstanding to think that waiting happens in places like the United Kingdom and Canada but does not happen in the United States. For instance it is not uncommon even for emergency cases in some U.S. hospitals to be boarded on beds in hallways for 48 hours or more due to lack of inpatient beds&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = GIFFIN  | author2 = SHARI M.

Between 1993 and 2003, the total number of hospitals in the United States decreased by 703, the number of hospital beds dropped by 198,000, and the number of EDs fell by 425. The result has been serious overcrowding. If the beds in a hospital are filled, patients cannot be transferred from the ED to inpatient units. This can lead to the practice of “boarding” patients—holding them in the ED, often in beds in hallways, until an inpatient bed becomes available.

&lt;/ref&gt; and people in the U.S. rationed out by being unable to afford their care are simply never counted and may never receive the care they need, a factor that is often overlooked. Statistics about waiting times in national systems are an honest approach to the issue of those waiting for access to care. Everyone waiting for care is reflected in the data, which, in the UK for example, are used to inform debate, decision-making and research within the government and the wider community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=1091|title=What does the Department of Health do? - Health Questions - NHS Direct&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=nhsdirect.nhs.uk|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031075726/http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=1091|archivedate=31 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/indicat/index_e.html|title=Health Indicators - Canada.ca|first=Health|last=Canada|date=|website=www.hc-sc.gc.ca|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513015835/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/indicat/index_e.html|archivedate=13 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.18weeks.nhs.uk/endwaiting/documents/EWCL_patient_LON_280907.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012102149/http://www.18weeks.nhs.uk/endwaiting/documents/EWCL_patient_LON_280907.pdf |archivedate=2009-10-12 |df= }} Setting new standards for your care: 2007 NHS patient leaflet on the 18 week maximum wait time promise for Dec 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some people in the U.S. are rationed out of care by unaffordable care or denial of access by [[Health maintenance organization|HMOs]] and insurers or simply because they cannot afford co-pays or deductibles even if they have insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/magazine/19healthcare-t.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=all | title=Why we must Ration Health Care | work=[[New York Times]] | date=July 15, 2009 | quote=But if the stories ... lead us to think badly of the British system of rationing health care, we should remind ourselves that the U.S. system also results in people going without life-saving treatment&amp;nbsp;— it just does so less visibly.

Opponents of the current reform care proposals fear that U.S. comparative effective research (a plan introduced in the stimulus bill) will be used to curtail spending and ration treatments, which is one function of the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE), arguing that rationing by market pricing rather by government is the best way for care to be rationed. However, when defining any group scheme, the same rules must apply to everyone in the scheme so some coverage rules had to be established. Britain has a national budget for public funded health care, and recognizes there has to be a logical trade off between spending on expensive treatments for some against, for example, caring for sick children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/03/health/03nice.html?_r=3&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515102140/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/03/health/03nice.html?_r=3&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all |archivedate=2013-05-15 |df= }} Quote "Britain’s National Health Service provides 95 percent of the nation’s care from an annual budget, so paying for costly treatments means less money for, say, sick children." from NY Times article Dec 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; NICE is therefore applying the same market pricing principles to make the hard job of deciding between funding some treatments and not funding others on behalf of everyone in the insured pool. This rationing does not preclude choice of obtaining insurance coverage for excluded treatment as insured persons do having the choice to take out supplemental health insurance for drugs and treatments that the NHS does not cover (at least one private insurer offers such a plan) or from meeting treatment costs out-of-pocket.

The debate in the U.S. over rationing has enraged some in the UK and statements made by politicians such as [[Sarah Palin]] and [[Chuck Grassley]] resulted in a mass Internet protest on websites such as Twitter and Facebook under the banner title "welovetheNHS" with positive stories of NHS experiences to counter the negative ones being expressed by these politicians and others and by certain media outlets such as ''Investor's Business Daily'' and Fox News.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/08/14/welove-thenhs-115875-21595748/The Mirror (UK newspaper) on public reaction and rage in UK to Palin, Grassley, IBD, and Fox (Hanan) interviews intended to denigrate the NHS&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, it is private health insurers that ration care (in the sense of not covering the most common services such as access to a primary care physician or excluding pre-existing conditions) rather than the NHS. Free access to a general practitioner is a core right in the NHS, but private insurers in the UK will not pay for payments to a private primary care physician.&lt;ref name="ABI"/&gt; Private insurers exclude many of the most common services as well as many of the most expensive treatments, whereas the vast majority of these are not excluded from the NHS but are obtainable at no cost to the patient. According to the [[Association of British Insurers]] (ABI), a typical policy will exclude the following: going to a general practitioner; going to [[Emergency department|accident and emergency]]; drug abuse; HIV/AIDS; normal pregnancy; gender reassignment; mobility aids, such as wheelchairs; organ transplant; injuries arising from dangerous hobbies (often called hazardous pursuits); pre-existing conditions; dental services; outpatient drugs and dressings; deliberately self-inflicted injuries; infertility; cosmetic treatment; experimental or unproven treatment or drugs; and war risks. Chronic illnesses, such as [[diabetes]] and [[Chronic kidney disease|end stage renal disease]] requiring [[dialysis]] are also excluded from coverage.&lt;ref name="ABI"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abi.org.uk/Information/Consumers/Health_and_Protection/496.pdf|title=Are you buying private medical insurance?

Palin had alleged that America will create rationing "[[death panels]]" to decide whether old people could live or die, again widely taken to be a reference to NICE. U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley alleged that he was told that Senator [[Edward Kennedy]] would have been refused the brain tumor treatment he was receiving in the United States had he instead lived a country with government run health care.

Supporters of private price rationing over waiting time rationing, such as ''[[The Atlantic]]'' columnist [[Megan McArdle]], argue time rationing leaves patients worse off since their time (measured as an [[opportunity cost]]) is worth much more than the price they would pay.&lt;ref name=McArdle&gt;[http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/08/rationing_by_any_other_name.php "Rationing By Any Other Name"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903182419/http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/08/rationing_by_any_other_name.php |date=2009-09-03 }}. By [[Megan McArdle]]. ''[[The Atlantic]]''. Published August 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents also state categorizing patients based on factors such as social value to the community or age will not work in a heterogeneous society without a common ethical consensus such as the U.S.&lt;ref name=patel/&gt; [[Doug Bandow]] of the [[CATO Institute]] wrote that government decision making would "override the differences in preferences and circumstances" for individuals and that it is a matter of personal liberty to be able to buy as much or as little care as one wants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Doug Bandow|title=Uwe Reinhardt on Health Care Rationing|publisher=[[CATO Institute]]|url=http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2009/07/06/uwe-reinhardt-on-health-care-rationing/|accessdate=September 7, 2009|authorlink=Doug Bandow|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906173825/http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2009/07/06/uwe-reinhardt-on-health-care-rationing/|archivedate=September 6, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither argument recognizes the fact that in most countries with socialized medicine, a parallel system of private health care allows people to pay extra to reduce their waiting time. The exception is that some provinces in Canada disallow the right to bypass queuing unless the matter is one in which the rights of the person under the constitution.

A 1999 article in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', stated "there is much merit in using waiting lists as a rationing mechanism for elective health care if the waiting lists are managed efficiently and fairly."&lt;ref name=scoring&gt;[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1114887 Points for pain: waiting list priority scoring systems] by Rhiannon Tudor Edwards.

Accessed September 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Kellermann|Dr. Arthur Kellermann]], associate dean for health policy at [[Emory University]], stated rationing by ability to pay rather than by anticipated medical benefits in the U.S. makes its system more unproductive, with poor people avoiding preventive care and eventually using expensive emergency treatment.&lt;ref name=scott&gt;{{Cite news|title=Doctors Say Health Care Rationing Already Exists|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106168331|accessdate=September 7, 2009|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]: ''[[All Things Considered]]''|date=July 1, 2009|first=Scott|last=Horsley|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904033216/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106168331|archivedate=September 4, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethicist]] [[Daniel Callahan]] has written that U.S. culture overly emphasizes individual autonomy rather than [[communitarian]] morals and that stops beneficial rationing by social value, which benefits everyone.&lt;ref name=patel/&gt;

Some argue that waiting lists result in great pain and suffering, but again evidence for this is unclear. In a recent survey of patients admitted to hospital in the UK from a waiting list or by planned appointment, only 10% reported they felt they should have been admitted sooner than they were. 72% reported the admission was as timely as they felt necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthcarecommission.org.uk/_db/_documents/Full_2007_results_with_historical_comparisons_-_tables.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029031549/http://www.healthcarecommission.org.uk/_db/_documents/Full_2007_results_with_historical_comparisons_-_tables.doc |archivedate=2008-10-29 |df= }} Healthcare Commission: 'Survey of adult inpatients in the NHS 2007'&lt;/ref&gt; Medical facilities in the U.S. do not report waiting times in national statistics as is done in other countries and it is a myth to believe there is no waiting for care in the U.S. Some argue that wait times in the U.S. could actually be as long as or longer than in other countries with universal health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_28/b4042072.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007064527/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_28/b4042072.htm |archivedate=2008-10-07 |df= }} ''Business Week'': The doctor will see you in 3 months&lt;/ref&gt;

There is considerable argument about whether any of the health bills currently before congress will introduce rationing. [[Howard Dean]] for example contested in an interview that they do not. However, ''[[Politico]]'' has pointed out that all health systems contain elements of rationing (such as coverage rules) and the public health care plan will therefore implicitly involve some element of rationing.&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;&lt;ref name=dean&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/25/howard-dean/rationing-health-care-reform/|title=There's rationing in health care now, and there still would be under reform bill|publisher=[[PolitiFact]]|accessdate=September 7, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830200720/http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/25/howard-dean/rationing-health-care-reform/|archivedate=August 30, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political interference and targeting===
In the UK, where government employees or government-employed sub-contractors deliver most health care, political interference is quite hard to discern. Most supply-side decisions are in practice under the control of medical practitioners and of boards comprising the medical profession. There is some antipathy towards the target-setting by politicians in the UK. Even the NICE criteria for public funding of medical treatments were never set by politicians. Nevertheless, politicians have set targets, for instance to reduce waiting times and to improve choice.  Academics have pointed out that the claims of success of the targeting are statistically flawed.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/press/press_release_pdfs/A&amp;E%20waiting%20targets%20-%20Les%20Mayhew.pdf Cass Business School: Academics challenge A&amp;E waiting times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910021448/http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/press/press_release_pdfs/A%26E%20waiting%20targets%20-%20Les%20Mayhew.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The veracity and significance of the claims of targeting interfering with clinical priorities are often hard to judge. For example, some UK ambulance crews have complained that hospitals would deliberately leave patients with ambulance crews to prevent an accident and emergency department (A&amp;E, or emergency room) target-time for treatment from starting to run. The Department of Health vehemently denied the claim, because the A&amp;E time begins when the ambulance arrives at the hospital and not after the handover. It defended the A&amp;E target by pointing out that the percentage of people waiting four hours or more in A&amp;E had dropped from just under 25% in 2004 to less than 2% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7249514.stm BBC News:Anger at 'patient stacking' claim] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517174557/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7249514.stm |date=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original ''Observer'' article reported that in London, 14,700 ambulance turnarounds were longer than an hour and 332 were more than two hours when the target turnaround time is 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/feb/17/health.nhs1 copy of original Observer story from Guardian website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718130903/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/feb/17/health.nhs1 |date=2016-07-18 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the context of the total number of emergency ambulance attendances by the [[London Ambulance Service]] each year (approximately 865,000),&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/publications/areport/London%20Ambulance%20Service%20AR%2006-07.pdf http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/publications/areport/London%20Ambulance%20Service%20AR%2006-07.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029031548/http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/publications/areport/London%20Ambulance%20Service%20AR%2006-07.pdf |date=2008-10-29 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; these represent just 1.6% and 0.03% of all ambulance calls. The proportion of these attributable to patients left with ambulance crews is not recorded. At least one junior doctor has complained that the four-hour A&amp;E target is too high and leads to unwarranted actions that are not in the best interests of patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4631793.stm | work=BBC News | title=Minister blasted over A&amp;E target | date=June 28, 2005 | accessdate=May 23, 2010 | first=Nick | last=Triggle | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030192743/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4631793.stm | archivedate=October 30, 2007 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political targeting of waiting-times in Britain has had dramatic effects. The [[National Health Service]] reports that the median admission wait-time for elective inpatient treatment (non-urgent hospital treatment) in England at the end of August 2007, was just under 6 weeks, and 87.5% of patients were admitted within 13 weeks. Reported waiting times in England also overstate the true waiting-time. This is because the clock starts ticking when the patient has been referred to a specialist by the GP and it only stops when the medical procedure is completed. The 18-week maximum waiting period target thus includes all the time taken for the patient to attend the first appointment with the specialist, time for any tests called for by the specialist to determine precisely the root of the patient's problem and the best way to treat it. It excludes time for any intervening steps deemed necessary prior to treatment, such as recovery from some other illness or the losing of excessive weight.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2004 the board of the [[University of Opole]]'s Faculty of [[Philology]] formally distanced itself from the theories propagated by Kamusella in a press release published by ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'', alleging methodological inadequacies and tendentious conclusions among other controversies in his historical research.&lt;ref name="Wyborcza2004"&gt;{{cite news |last=Łabutin |first=Beata |date=13 May 2004 |title=Uniwersytet dystansuje się od autora glosariusza |trans-title=The university distanced itself from the author of a glossary |url=http://opole.gazeta.pl/opole/1,35114,2072518.html |format=Press Release |language=Polish |newspaper=[[Gazeta Wyborcza]] |location=Warsaw |access-date=30 August 2015 |via=Wyborcza.pl Wiadomości z Opola |quote=Jak zapewnia dziekan Wydziału Filologicznego prof.

'''Trophies of Damascus''' was a 7th-century [[Antisemitism|anti-Jewish]] tract written between 661 and 681 AD which presents an eye-witness accounts to the events that took place around that time period in the [[Middle East]]. It categorizes the nascent Saracens (Muslim) tribes as part of an alliance of Jewish clans fighting against the [[Byzantine]] [[Christians]] in contradiction to later accounts from traditional [[Islamic]] sources.

[[Uber]] is an international [[transportation network company]] (TNC) and [[technology company]], best known for its [[peer-to-peer ridesharing]] operations worldwide. It has its headquarters in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], and has subsidiaries in many countries. The company has experienced many protests to their entry into many markets around the world, and has been subjected to a variety of laws to regulate its activities.

A number of communities, governments, and organizations have established rules and regulations that specifically govern TNCs and, in some jurisdictions, TNCs operations are completely illegal.&lt;ref name=war/&gt; Regulations can include requirements for driver background checks,&lt;ref name=quebec/&gt; fares,&lt;ref name=legiscan/&gt; the number of drivers,&lt;ref name=roadblock/&gt; and licensing.&lt;ref name=nsw/&gt;

[[Taxi]] industry groups have argued that TNCs are [[illegal taxicab operation]]s which take away their business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/311452-california-theyre-not-taxis-theyre-transportation-network-companies/ | title=In California, They're Not Taxis, They're 'Transportation Network Companies' | first=Alex | last=Goldmark | work=[[WNYC]] | date=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have called for governments to relax legislation in favor of ridesharing companies such as Uber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Regulators must lighten up as they clash with the sharing economy | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/aug/18/sharing-economy-regulators-law-uber-lyft | first=Alex | last=Stephany | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uber is banned from or has voluntary pulled out of, due to legal restrictions, the following jurisdictions: parts of [[Oregon]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Denmark]], [[Hungary]], and parts of [[Germany]]. The UberPop level of service is banned in [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Netherlands]], and [[Finland]].&lt;ref name=war&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/news/where-is-uber-banned/ | title=How the world is going to war with Uber | first=Greg | last=Dickenson | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legally, Uber claims its drivers are [[independent contractor]]s, and not [[employee]]s. This designation may affect taxation, [[work hours]], and [[overtime]] benefits and has been controversial. Lawsuits have been filed by Uber drivers alleging that they are entitled to the rights and remedies of being considered "employees" under [[employment law]].

==Experiences by countries==
===Australia===
====Requirement of drivers to pay GST====
In May 2015, the [[Australian Taxation Office]] (ATO) issued a directive stating that drivers that generate income via a TNC need to have an [[Australian Business Number]] and be registered to pay the [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST). Uber filed suit in the [[Federal Court of Australia]], arguing that the public issue by the ATO "unfairly targets Uber's driver-partners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Uber challenges ATO in court over GST | url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/uber-challenges-ato-in-court-over-gst/ | first=Aimee | last=Chanthadavong | work=[[ZDNet]] | date=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ato.gov.au/general/ride-sourcing-and-tax/ | title=Ride-sourcing and tax | publisher=[[Australian Taxation Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, a justice found in favor of the ATO, requiring drivers to register, collect and pay GST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/17/uber-drivers-must-pay-gst-federal-court-rules | title=Uber drivers must pay GST, federal court rules | first=Paul | last=Farrell | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ATO ruling overrides the standard applied to other small Australian businesses, which only requires businesses grossing more than A$75,000 to collect and remit GST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/GST/Registering-for-GST/ | title=Registering for GST | publisher=[[Australian Taxation Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australian Capital Territory====
Ridesharing was legalized in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] in September 2015. At the same time, fees for taxis and hire cars were reduced to enable them to compete against rideshare operators. Taxis will continue to have the exclusive right to work at taxi ranks or be hailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/world-first-uber-to-be-legalised-in-australias-capital/news-story/ee4ed2f8bc0fdaa6d05db5e366b5e1fd | title=World first: Uber to be legalised in Australia's capital | first=Malcolm | last=Fzarr | work=[[News.com.au]] | date=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New South Wales====
On 30 April 2014, [[Transport for New South Wales]] clarified that TNC services must be provided in a licensed taxi or hire car, by an appropriately accredited driver.&lt;ref name=nsw&gt;{{cite press release | title=Transport for NSW statement regarding ridesharing apps | url=http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/transport-nsw-statement-regarding-ride-sharing-apps | publisher=[[Transport for New South Wales]] | date=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, the [[New South Wales]] government confirmed that in April 2014, it conducted an unannounced search of Uber's Sydney offices in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.smh.com.au/technology/nsw-government-confirms-it-raided-the-offices-of-rideshare-company-uber-20141219-12af8s.html | title=NSW government confirms it raided the offices of ride-share company Uber | first=Jacob | last=Saulwick | work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date= December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, the New South Wales government created a task force to look into regulating Uber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=NSW transport taskforce pushes for regulatory framework changes | url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/nsw-transport-taskforce-pushes-for-regulatory-framework-changes/ | first=Aimee | last=Chanthadavong | work=[[ZDNet]] | date=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://p2p-prod-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/p2p/s3fs-public/discussion-paper.pdf | title=Point to Point Transport Taskforce Discussion Paper | publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]] | date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 17 December 2015, taxi and ridesharing passengers pay a $1 levy per trip for five years to fund a $250 million compensation fund for taxi licence holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/uberx-legalised-in-nsw-compensation-for-taxi-plate-owners-20151217-glpt6r.html | title=UberX legalised in NSW: compensation for taxi plate owners | first=Matt | last=O'Sullivan | work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=December 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Territory====
Ridesharing was legalized in the [[Northern Territory]] in January 2018, with a $1 levy being imposed on all taxi, minibus, private hire and ridesharing trips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/mediaRelease/24159 | title=Delivering on our Promises – Ridesharing comes to the Territory | publisher=[[Northern Territory]] | date=January 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Queensland====
In mid-November 2014, the Taxi Council of Queensland (TCQ) launched an anti-Uber media campaign.

Though the government ban was still on effect, the TNCs operated in the city. On December 3, 2017, the BRTA formulated a guideline for TNCs and most of the TNCs were given operating licenses by February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thedailystar.net/country/uber-and-pathao-ride-apps-get-government-nod-need-brta-permit-1520146 | title=Ride-apps get nod, need BRTA permit | work=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] | date=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CNG Auto-rickshaw Drivers of [[Dhaka]] and [[Chittagong]] implemented a [[strike action]] on December 27–28, 2017 with 8 demands that included a ban on TNCs.

The advertisement stated that the role was "by far the most demanding position Uber has to offer."&lt;ref name="Bel" /&gt;

In October 2015, Uber suspended its UberPOP service, but continued to operate its UberX service, which uses licensed drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-tech-belgium-idUSKCN0S71VQ20151013 | title=Uber to suspend unlicensed UberPOP service in Brussels | first=Robert-Jan | last=Bartunek | work=[[Reuters]] | date=October 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, taxi drivers protested, blocking roads, demanding the government drop plans to make it easier for TNCs to operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-protest-belgium/taxi-drivers-block-traffic-in-brussels-to-protest-uberisation-idUSKBN1H32GI | title=Taxi drivers block traffic in Brussels to protest 'Uberisation' | first1=Samantha | last1=Koester | first2=Julia | last2=Fioretti | work=[[Reuters]] | date=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
On April 29, 2015, a Brazilian court banned Uber in response to complaints by a taxi drivers' union.

In October 2015, [[Fernando Haddad]], the mayor of [[São Paulo]], signed a bill to allow for a new category of "black taxis" which would operate in parallel to the city's existing licensed taxis but only be bookable via mobile phone apps. Uber rejected the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Horch | first=Dan | title=Uber Rejects Proposal That Would Legalize Its Service in Brazil's Largest City | url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/08/uber-rejects-proposal-that-would-legalize-its-service-in-brazils-largest-city/ | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 8, 2015}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
After Uber Black and UberPop were launched in Copenhagen in November 2014, the [[Danish Transport Authority]] filed a complaint accusing Uber of operating illegally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Denmark seeks to block Uber taxi service | url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/denmark-seeks-to-block-uber-taxi-service | work=[[Special Broadcasting Service]] | date=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, Denmark's transport minister stated that, although he was not opposed to Uber, the app was "contrary" to Danish law—consumer safety and employee training were identified as the key concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Denmark likely to ban ridesharing service Uber | url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2015/01/22/denmark-likely-to-ban-ridesharing-service-uber/ | agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher=[[The Mercury News]] | date=January 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
On June 11, 2014, in a concerted action, taxis blocked roads in major European cities in protest against what they perceived as a threat to their livelihoods from TNCs. The cabbies contended that Uber and similar smartphone app-based services have an unfair advantage because they are not subject to the same kinds of fees and regulations placed on taxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/11/taxi-drivers-strike-uber-london-live-updates | title=Taxi drivers in European capitals strike over Uber – as it happened | first=Mark | last=Tran | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/photos-taxis-blockade-european-cities-in-uber-strike-1402495206 | title=Photos: Taxis Blockade European Cities in Uber Strike | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=June 11, 2014}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled that Uber is a transport company, subject to local transport regulation in [[European Union]] member states, rather than a [[information society]] service as Uber had argued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42423627 | title=Uber is officially a cab firm, says European court | work=[[BBC News]] | date= December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In early 2014, Berlin authorities ruled against Uber—which operated in the German cities of Berlin, [[Munich]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Hamburg]], and [[Düsseldorf]]—on two occasions following a case filed by the Berlin Taxi Association. The first ruling, delivered by a court in April 2014, deemed Uber's limousine service to be in breach of local legislation, while an August 13, 2014 decision banned the service from operating in Berlin due to safety concerns—the latter decision, which included a €25,000 fine for non-compliance, cited issues pertaining to unregulated vehicles and unqualified drivers who are not properly insured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Berlin Bans Uber, Taxi Drivers Cheer | url=http://www.inc.com/associated-press/berlin-taxi-drivers-hail-citys-uber-ban.html | first=Frank | last=Jordans | agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher=[[Inc (magazine)|Inc.]] | date=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 16, 2014, the district court of Frankfurt revoked the preliminary injunction, thereby re-allowing Uber to operate in Germany.&lt;ref name="fra-revoke"&gt;{{cite web | title=Uber welcomes today's Frankfurt court decision lifting the injunction brought by taxi incumbents | url=https://www.uber.com/en-DE/newsroom/uber-begrust-die-entscheidung-des-landgerichts-frankfurt-zur-aufhebung-der-einstweiligen-verfugung-gegen-uberpop-3 | date=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presiding judge wrote that the Taxi Deutschland case "would have had prospects for success", but the case was merely lodged too late, as any case needs to be filed within two months of a service's launch—Uber started in Germany in April 2014, but the case was filed in August 2014.&lt;ref name=liftsban/&gt;Taxi Deutschland appealed the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/court-overturns-ban-on-uberpop-in-germany-1410872575 | title=German Taxi Drivers to Appeal Lifting of Uber Ban | first=Ulrike | last=Dauer | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=September 16, 2014}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 18, 2015, a Frankfurt district court imposed a nationwide ban on UberPop, claiming that drivers do not have proper licensing and insurance.

In December 2014, following allegations of rape against an Uber driver in [[New Delhi]], Uber was banned from New Delhi for not following the city's compulsory police verification procedure.&lt;ref name="Delhi"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-rape-uber-banned-in-capital-accused-driver-sent-to-police-custody-till-dec-11/story-WC1OX5lBAuJPSUKyaZjq5L.html | title=Delhi rape: Uber banned in Capital; accused driver sent to police custody till Dec 11 | first1=Karn Pratap | last1=Singh | first2=Avantika | last2=Mehta | work=[[Hindustan Times]] | date=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bandelhi&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.ndtv.com/cheat-sheet/uber-banned-in-delhi-ceo-travis-kalanick-suggests-authorities-partly-to-blame-10-developments-710331 | title=Uber Banned in Delhi, CEO Tries to Dodge Blame: 10 Developments | first=Sonal | last=Mehrotra | work=[[NDTV]] | date=December 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The driver had been charged, then acquitted, of a prior sexual assault in 2011.&lt;ref name="Delhi"/&gt; Within two days of the rape incident, almost 7,000 people signed a petition calling on Uber to conduct mandatory 7-year background checks on drivers, in line with its U.S. operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Hannah Jane | last=Parkinson | title=Uber rape scandal: thousands demand driver background checks in India | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/08/uber-rape-claim-india-7000-people-sign-petition | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=December 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delhi's transport department banned Uber.&lt;ref name=bandelhi/&gt; Uber issued a statement stating that it would work with the Indian government "to establish clear background checks currently absent in their commercial transportation licensing programs."&lt;ref name=bandelhimis/&gt;

In banning Uber, Delhi's transport department cited several rules that Uber had broken. According to New Delhi's Radio Taxi Scheme, 2006, all taxi licensees must be either a company under the Companies Act, 2013 (or the 1956 Act), or a society under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. Furthermore, taxi services must provide adequate parking space for all taxis, as well as sufficiently sized office space to accommodate the control room, the maintenance of a minimum fleet size per license (500 vehicles), and all vehicles must be fitted with GPS/GPRS tracking systems (to be in constant communication with the control room while on duty). The rules also stipulate that the taxi licensee is responsible for ensuring the quality of drivers, including police verifications, supervision, and employee behaviour.&lt;ref name=bandelhimis&gt;{{cite news | url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/software/delhi-government-bans-uber-says-it-is-misleading-customers/articleshow/45411180.cms | first=Aman | last=Sharma | title=Delhi Government bans Uber, says it is misleading customers | work=[[The Economic Times]] | date=December 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Criminal probe due to use of Greyball=====
Uber developed an internal software tool called [[Greyball]], which uses data collected from the Uber mobile app other means, to avoid giving rides to certain individuals. The tool was used starting in 2014. By showing "ghost cars" driven by fake drivers to the targeted individuals in the Uber mobile app, and by giving real drivers a means to cancel rides requested by those individuals, Uber was able to avoid giving rides to known law enforcement officers in areas where its service is illegal. [[Investigative journalism]] by ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the resulting report, published on March 3, 2017, made public Uber's use of Greyball since 2014, describing it as a way to evade city code enforcement officials in [[Portland, Oregon]], Australia, South Korea, and China.&lt;ref name=nyt_greyball&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html | first=Mike | last=Isaac | title=How Uber Deceives the Authorities Worldwide | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, in response to the report, Uber stated that Greyball was designed to deny rides to users who violate Uber's [[terms of service]], including those involved in [[sting operation]]s.&lt;ref name=nyt_greyball/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-uber-greyball-20170303-story.html | title=Uber's secret 'Greyball' program shows just how far it will go to get its way | first1=Craig | last1=Timberg | first2=Brian | last2=Fung | work=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=March 3, 2017}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Uber, Greyball can "hide the standard city app view for individual riders, enabling Uber to show that same rider a different version". Uber reportedly used Greyball to identify government officials through factors such as whether a user frequently opens the app near government offices, a review of social media profiles by Uber employees to identify law enforcement personnel, and the credit cards associated with the Uber account.&lt;ref name=nyt_greyball/&gt;

The [[United States Department of Labor]] issued guidelines in July 2015 to deal with, what it considers, "misclassification" of workers.

=====Alleged short-changing of drivers=====
In 2017 a lawsuit was filed alleging that Uber uses "sophisticated software" to defraud both drivers and passengers. According to the suit, under the upfront pricing model, when a passenger is quoted a price the app shows a longer more expensive route, meanwhile would-be drivers are shown a shorter cheaper route. The passenger is charged for the more expensive route, while the driver is paid the cheaper, with Uber pocketing the difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uber-accused-of-extensive-methodical-scheme-to-short-change-drivers-us-lawsuit-upfront-pricing-a7673096.html | title=Uber accused of 'extensive, methodical scheme' to short-change drivers | last=Chapman | first=Ben | work=[[The Independent]] | date=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alaska====
In September 2015, Uber paid the State of Alaska $77,925 and paused operations in [[Anchorage]]. The state argued that Uber was misclassifying drivers as contractors instead of employees, which was illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Uber will pay fine to state workers' compensation division | url=https://www.adn.com/business/article/uber-agrees-pay-fine-state-workers-compensation-division/2015/09/04/ | first=Sean | last=Doogan | work=[[Anchorage Daily News]] | date=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====California====
In May 2011, Uber received a [[cease-and-desist]] letter from the [[San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency]], claiming it was operating an unlicensed taxi service, and another legal demand from the [[California Public Utilities Commission]] (CPUC) that it was operating an unlicensed limousine dispatch. Both claimed criminal violations and demanded that the company cease operations. In response, the company, among other things, changed its name from UberCab to Uber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Siegler | first=MG | url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/25/uber-airbnb-jail-time/ | title=Uber CEO: I Think I've Got 20,000 Years Of Jail Time In Front Of Me | work=[[TechCrunch]] | date=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 2012, the CPUC issued a cease-and-desist letter to Uber, [[Lyft]], and [[SideCar (company)|SideCar]], and fined each $20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Uber-Lyft-SideCar-hit-with-20K-fines-4037863.php | title=PUC fines 3 app-hailing taxi startups | first=Benny | last=Evangelista | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an interim agreement was reached in 2013 reversing those actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=A Day After Cutting A Deal With Lyft, California Regulator Reaches An Agreement With Uber As Well | url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/31/a-day-after-cutting-a-deal-with-lyft-california-regulator-reaches-an-agreement-with-uber-as-well/ | last=Lawler | first=Ryan | work=[[TechCrunch]] | date=January 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Lyft, Uber and Sidecar were served with cease and desist letters by the [[Los Angeles Department of Transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.cnet.com/news/uber-lyft-sidecar-get-cease-and-desist-letters-from-la/ | title=Uber, Lyft, Sidecar get cease-and-desist letters from LA | first=Dara | last=Kerr | work=[[CNET]] | date=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, the CPUC unanimously voted to make the agreement permanent, creating a new category of service called [[transportation network company]] to cover Lyft, UberX, SideCar, and [[Summon (company)|Summon]], thereby making California the first jurisdiction to recognize such services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Yeung | first=Ken | title=California Becomes First State To Regulate Ridesharing Services benefiting Uber, Lyft, Sidecar, and InstantCab | url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/09/19/california-becomes-first-state-to-regulate-ride-sharing-services/ | work=TheNextWeb | date=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2013/09/19/california-becomes-first-state-to-regulate-ridesharing-services-lyft-sidecar-uberx/ | title=California Becomes First State To Regulate Ridesharing Services Lyft, Sidecar, UberX | first=Tomio | last=Geron | work=[[Forbes]] | date=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 2014, California's Governor approved the "Assembly Bill No. 2293" bill that became effective on July 1, 2015. The bill amended "the Passenger Charter-party Carriers' Act to enact specified requirements for liability insurance coverage for transportation network companies, as defined, and their participating drivers." The driver under the law is defined as "any person who uses a vehicle in connection with a transportation network company's online-enabled application or platform to connect with passengers." The stated minimum insurance requirement ranges from US$50,000 to $100,000 for death and injuries per individual or incident, and stipulates US$30,000 for property damage. As a breach of the bill is classified as a criminal act, a corresponding "state-mandated local program" will be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=AB-2293 Transportation network companies: insurance coverage.(2013–2014) | url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml | publisher=California Legislative Information | date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, a case that was originally filed on December 9, 2014, by the [[district attorney]]s of both [[Los Angeles, California]], and San Francisco was resolved. Prosecutors claimed that Uber made misleading statements about the background checks it performs on drivers and falsely charged a "safe ride fee." The case was resolved when Uber agreed to no longer claim to be the "safest ride on the road", change the name of the "safe ride fee" to "booking fee", and pay $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Uber's 'safe ride fee' becomes 'booking fee' after $25m settlement over rider safety | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/07/uber-driver-background-check-lawsuit-passenger-safety-california | last=Hern | first=Alex | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; San Francisco's city attorneys had previously settled out of court with Lyft over similar allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_27102694/biz-break-san-francisco-and-l-sue-uber | title=Biz Break: San Francisco and L.A. sue Uber, claim misleading and illegal actions | work=[[San Jose Mercury News]] | date=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====California employment law=====
In a [[class action lawsuit]] filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] on August 16, 2013, Uber drivers plead that they were employees who had been misclassified as independent contractors in violation of the [[California Labor Code]] and demanded that they be given payment of business expenses such as gas and maintenance of their vehicles. In March 2015, District Judge [[Edward M. Chen]] ruled that the case will be resolved by a jury, dismissing a motion for [[summary judgement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=O'Connor v. Uber Technologies Inc. | url=https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/cases/5646 | publisher=[[Harvard University]] | date=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 1, 2015, Chen certified the class but generally limited it to drivers in California hired before June 2014, when an opt-out arbitration clause was included in the contract, who had directly contracted with Uber.&lt;ref name=NYT9115&gt;{{cite news |title=Uber Rebuffed by Judge in Ruling on Drivers' Suit | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/technology/uber-rebuffed-by-judge-in-ruling-on-drivers-suit.html | first=Mike | last=Isaac | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=September 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=C13-3826&gt;{{cite web | title=O'Connor v.

====Massachusetts====
On August 1, 2012, the [[Massachusetts]] Division of Standards issued a cease-and-desist letter to Uber on the grounds that the GPS-based smartphone app was not a certified measurement device, but on August 15, the agency reversed its ruling after prodding by Governor [[Deval Patrick]], saying that technique was satisfactory because it was under study by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.boston.com/uncategorized/noprimarytagmatch/2012/08/15/state-reverses-ban-on-uber-car-service-ordering-app | title=State reverses ban on Uber car service ordering app | first=Michael B. | last=Farrell | work=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uber worked out an arrangement with the city of Boston to share quarterly data on the duration, locations, and times of day in which riders used the app to travel in or out of the city. This information was first delivered to the city in February 2015, and the report kept all individual user data private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=In first, Uber to share ride data with Boston | first=Nicole | last=Dungca | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/01/13/uber-share-ridership-data-with-boston/4Klo40KZREtQ7jkoaZjoNN/story.html | work=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike taxis, TNC vehicles are prohibited from "cruising" for passengers on streets. The law also establishes a $0.20 per-ride charge, which is distributed to cities and towns for transportation and ride-for-hire economic development purposes.

====Michigan====
In December 2016, Michigan instituted regulations on TNCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/12/01/uber-regulations/94744106/ | title=Michigan Senate green lights Uber, Lyft regulations | first=Jonathan | last=Oosting | work=[[Detroit News]] | date=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nevada====
On November 25, 2014, [[Washoe County, Nevada]] [[State court (United States)|District Court]] Judge Scott Freeman, issued a [[preliminary injunction]] preventing Uber from operating statewide. The temporary injunction was based on the company's failure to file a [[certificate of public convenience and necessity]], which is required for every transportation service in Nevada. The [[Government of Nevada]] also claimed that Uber's screening process was not rigorous enough to protect consumers, and failed to conform with the aforementioned regulations. Uber contested the ruling, arguing that it is an app-based technology company rather than a transportation company, but the company's management made the decision to temporarily shut down its Nevada operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-nevada-ridesharing-idUSKCN0JB18J20141127 | title=Ridesharing firm Uber suspends operations in Nevada | first=Eric M. | last=Johnson | work=[[Reuters]] | date=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevada legalized TNCs in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-uber-nevada-20150528-story.html | title=Uber gets big win in Nevada as Legislature OKs bill authorizing service | first=Tracy | last=Lieman | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=May 27, 2015}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislation passed in 2016 in New Hampshire requires each TNC (not each driver) to pay an annual fee of $500. It also includes requirements that each TNC get a permit from the state, obtain a driver history report on each driver that meets the provisions of the law, and require their drivers to have liability insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nhbr.com/May-13-2016/NH-Senate-OKs-Uber-regulations/ | title=NH Senate OKs Uber regulations | first=Bob |last=Sanders | work=[[New Hampshire Business Review]] | date=May 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the release of the audit, Portland's commissioner of police suggested that the city subpoena Uber in order to force the company to turn over information on how Uber used software to evade regulatory officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Njus | first=Elliot | title=Portland may subpoena Uber over regulator-dodging 'Greyball' software | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/commuting/index.ssf/2017/04/portland_may_subpoena_uber_ove.html | work=[[The Oregonian]] | date=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, a $1.5M lawsuit was filed against Uber in Philadelphia by Philadelphia taxicab medallion owners, claiming that Uber engaged in [[tortious interference]] and engaged in false advertising under the Lanham Act. The case was dismissed in August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Coachtrans v.

On May 7, 2016, Uber and Lyft announced they would no longer provide service in Austin after city voters rejected a referendum backed by the TNCs that would have repealed a city ordinance requiring their drivers to submit to fingerprint-based background checks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Uber, Lyft Shut Down in Austin Over Fingerprint Vote | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/texas-capital-city-votes-to-keep-fingerprinting-for-uber-lyft-drivers-1462796972 | first1=Douglas | last1=MacMillan | first2=Rachel Emma | last2=Silverman| work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=May 9, 2016}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Houston=====
In late 2016, Uber threatened to leave [[Houston]] ahead of [[Super Bowl LI]], insisting various city regulations, including fingerprint background checks of drivers, were too burdensome. Houston officials and Uber reached a compromise in December 2016, whereby Houston would continue to require a fingerprint check for drivers but eliminate requirements for driver drug testing and physicals through at least February 5, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mashable.com/2017/02/03/uber-super-bowl-houston/#KU1P7afA5PqJ | title=Uber barely hangs on in Houston ahead of Super Bowl, while Airbnb claims 'biggest nights ever' | last=Hinchliffe | first=Emma | work=[[Mashable]] | date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, to appease taxi drivers, the Seattle City Council passed an ordinance in March 2014 that capped the number of drivers from any TNC on the road at any given time to 150.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/17/seattle-hates-ride-sharing/ | title=Seattle Deals A Blow To Uber And Lyft By Limiting The Number Of Ride-Sharing Drivers On The Road | first=Ryan | last=Lawler | work=[[TechCrunch]] | date=March 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on April 17, 2014, after a coalition obtained 36,000 signatures to put the question to voters in a referendum, Mayor [[Ed Murray (Washington politician)|Ed Murray]] announced a 45-day negotiation process to find an alternative approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.geekwire.com/2014/ride-sharing-petition-seattle/ | title=Seattle ride-sharing regulations suspended; Mayor wants to negotiate with stakeholders | first=Taylor | last=Soper | work=[[GeekWire]] | date=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uber donated over $613,000 to "Seattle Citizens to Repeal Ordinance 124441", a political group seeking to overturn the ordinance limiting the number of TNC vehicles in Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Contributions to Seattle Citizens to Repeal Ordinance 124441 2014 Election Cycle | url=http://web6.seattle.gov/ethics/elections/poplist.aspx?cid=374&amp;listtype=contributors | publisher=Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014, the mayor reached a deal to legalize TNCs with no driver limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.geekwire.com/2014/seattle-legalizes-uber-lyft-caps/ | title=Seattle mayor reaches deal to legalize Uber, Lyft and Sidecar, without driver limits | first=Taylor | last=Soper | work=[[GeekWire]] | date=June 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compromise was passed by the city council in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.seattlemet.com/articles/2014/7/14/city-council-finally-legalizes-ridesharing-july-2014 | title=City Council Legalizes Ridesharing | first=Erica C. | last=Barnett | work=[[Seattle Metropolitan]] | date=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Washington, D.C.====
In January 2012, an Uber driver's car was impounded as part of a sting by the Washington, D.C. taxicab commission. The commissioner said the company was operating an unlicensed taxicab service in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Greene | first=David | url=https://www.npr.org/2012/01/31/146123433/upstart-car-service-butts-heads-with-d-c-s-taxis | title=Upstart Car Service Butts Heads With D.C.'s Taxis | work=[[NPR]] | date=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a social media campaign by Uber riders, the D.C. city council voted in July 2012 to formally legalize TNCs, which led to protests by taxicab drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/10/uber-vs-washington-dc/ | work=[[The New York Times]] | first=Brian X. | last=Chen | title=Uber, Maker of Summon-a-Car App, Wins in Washington | date=July 10, 2012}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Washington, D.C.

{{Politics of Bangladesh}}
The '''Vice-President of Bangladesh''' was formerly the second highest constitutional office in [[Bangladesh]], when the country was governed under a [[presidential system]]. The Vice-President was the first person in the presidential line of succession, in the event of a President's resignation, removal or death. The post was held by several Bangladeshi statesmen during different periods of the country's history. The inaugural office holder was [[Syed Nazrul Islam]] during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. The final office holder was [[Shahabuddin Ahmed]]. [[Abdus Sattar (president)|Abdus Sattar]] was the only vice-president to succeed to the presidency in 1981. 

The office was first created in the [[Provisional Government of Bangladesh]] in 1971. It was later revived in 1977, abolished in the [[1982 Bangladesh coup d'état|1982 coup d'état]]; and reinstated in 1986. It was abolished again during the [[Constitution of Bangladesh#Twelfth Amendment|Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="831">A '''War referendum''' is a proposed type of [[referendum]] in which citizens decide whether a nation should go to war. No such referendum has taken place.

The earliest idea of a war referendum came from [[Marquis de Condorcet]] in 1793 and [[Immanuel Kant]] in 1795.&lt;ref name="ballot"&gt;{{Cite book
