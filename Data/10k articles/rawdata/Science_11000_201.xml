'''Al-Kuz''' is an [[impact crater]] on the anti-Saturn hemisphere of [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]].  Al-Kuz was first observed in ''[[Cassini-Huygens Mission|Cassini]]'' images during that mission's March 2005 flyby of Enceladus.  It is located at 18.7° South [[Latitude]], 178.2° West [[Longitude]], and is 9.3 kilometers across.&lt;ref name=gpn /&gt;  Since the crater's formation, numerous southwest-northeast trending fractures cut across the crater, forming canyons several hundred meters deep along the crater's rim.  In addition, a smaller impact occurred along the northern crater wall, forming a crater 4 kilometers wide.

Al-Kuz is named after one of the barber's six brothers in "[[The Hunchback's Tale]]" in ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2534">'''Anthropology of food''' is a sub-discipline of [[anthropology]] that connects an [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] and historical perspective with contemporary social issues in food production and consumption systems. 

Although early anthropological accounts often dealt with cooking and eating as part of ritual or daily life, food was rarely regarded as the central point of academic focus. This changed in the later half of the 20th century, when foundational work by [[Mary Douglas]], [[Marvin Harris]], [[Arjun Appadurai]], [[Jack Goody]], and [[Sidney Mintz]] cemented the study of food as a key insight into modern social life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Handbook of Food and Anthropology|last=Klein and Watson|first=|publisher=]Bloomsbury Academic|year=2016|isbn=9780857855947|location=|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mintz is known as the "Father of food anthropology"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/us/sidney-mintz-father-of-food-anthropology-dies-at-93.html|title=Sidney Mintz, Father of Food Anthropology, dies at 93|last=Roberts|first=Sam|date=|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his work ''Sweetness and Power (1985),''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sweetness and Power: The Place of Sugar in Modern History|last=Mintz|first=Sidney|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=0140092331|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which linked British demand for sugar with the creation of empire and exploitative industrial labor conditions. 

Research has traced the material and symbolic importance of food, as well as how they intersect&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Food History|last=Pilcher|first=Jeremy|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=9780199729937|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Several related and interdisciplinary academic programs exist in the US and UK&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.food-culture.org/food-studies-programs/|title=Food Studies Programs|last=|first=|date=|website=food-culture.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (listed under [[Food studies]] institutions).

== Natural reservoir ==

Asama virus was isolated through RNA extracts from lung tissues of the Japanese shrew mole (Urotrichus talpoides), captured in Japan between February and April 2008. It is one of the first hantaviruses found in a mole.

== Virology ==
Asama virus is genetically closer to other hantaviruses harbored by shrews than by rodents. However, the nucleocapsid protein is similar to that of rodent and shrew-borne hantaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses positions it closest to soricine shrew-borne hantaviruses. This suggests a possible [[host-switch]]ing event in the distant past.

Asama virus is related to soricine shrew-borne hantaviruses that are found in North America, Europe, and Asia. This relation was discovered through phylogenetic analyses. The relationship between the two hantaviruses may suggest parallel evolution associated with cross-species transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Shannon N., Laurie Diznie, Laarni Sumibcay, Satoru Arai, Luis A.

[[File:JohannesVermeer-TheAstronomer(1668).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|''[[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|The Astronomer]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]]]]

An '''astronomer''' is a [[scientist]] in the field of [[astronomy]] who focuses their studies on a specific question or field outside the scope of [[Earth]]. They observe [[astronomical object]]s such as [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[natural satellite|moons]], [[comet]]s, and [[galaxy|galaxies]] – in either [[observational astronomy|observational]] (by analyzing the data) or [[theoretical astronomy]]. Examples of topics or fields astronomers study include [[planetary science]], solar astronomy, the origin or [[stellar evolution|evolution of stars]], or the [[galaxy formation and evolution|formation of galaxies]]. Related but distinct subjects like [[physical cosmology]], which studies the [[Universe]] as a whole.

Astronomers usually fall under either of two main types: observational and [[scientific theory|theoretical]]. Observational astronomers make direct [[observation]]s of celestial objects and analyze the data. In contrast, theoretical astronomers create and investigate [[Conceptual model|model]]s of things that cannot be observed. Because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle, astronomers must observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form, evolve, and die. They use these data to create models or [[simulation]]s to theorize how different celestial objects work.

Further subcategories under these two main [[branches of science|branches]] of astronomy include planetary astronomy, [[galactic astronomy]], or physical cosmology.

[[History of astronomy|Historically]], astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of [[phenomena]] in the sky, while [[astrophysics]] attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws. Today, that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms "astronomer" and "astrophysicist" are interchangeable. Professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[physics]] or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.noao.edu/education/astfaq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Becoming an Astronomer |accessdate=29 March 2009 |work= |publisher=NOAO | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090403101540/http://www.noao.edu/education/astfaq.html| archivedate= 3 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; They spend the majority of their time working on research, although they quite often have other duties such as teaching, building instruments, or aiding in the operation of an observatory.

The number of professional astronomers in the [[United States]] is actually quite small. The [[American Astronomical Society]], which is the major organization of professional astronomers in [[North America]], has approximately 7,000 members. This number includes scientists from other fields such as physics, [[geology]], and [[engineering]], whose research interests are closely related to astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aas.org/ |title=American Astronomical Society Home |accessdate=14 August 2009 |work= |publisher=AAS| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090802044012/http://aas.org/|archive-date= 2 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Astronomical Union]] comprises almost 10,145 members from 70 different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the Ph.D. level and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iau.org/about/ |title=About IAU |accessdate=14 August 2009 |work= |publisher=IAU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Br Guy in Lab.jpg|right|thumb|160px|[[Guy Consolmagno]] [[Vatican Observatory]], analyzing a meteorite, 2014]]
Contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a [[telescope]] through the dark hours of the night, it is far more common to use a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) camera to record a long, deep exposure, allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the [[light]] is added over time. Before CCDs, [[photographic plates]] were a common method of observation. Modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year. Analysis of observed phenomena, along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe, takes the majority of observational astronomers' time.

Astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes. Most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes [[planetarium]]s as a public service to encourage interest in the field.

Those who become astronomers usually have a broad background in maths, sciences and computing in high school. Taking courses that teach how to research, write and present papers are also invaluable. In college/university most astronomers get a Ph.D. in astronomy or physics.

== Amateur astronomers ==
[[Image:Emily_Lakdawalla_at_FameLab_at_LPSC_2013.jpg|right|thumb|160px|[[Emily Lakdawalla]] at the Planetary Conference 2013]]
While there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers, the field is popular among [[amateurs]]. Most cities have [[amateur astronomy]] clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host [[star party|star parties]]. The [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] is the largest general astronomical society in the world, comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.astrosociety.org/about.html |title=About Us |accessdate=29 March 2009 |work= |publisher=[[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090225074145/http://astrosociety.org/about.html| archivedate= 25 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like any [[hobby]], most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to [[stargazing]] and reading the latest developments in research. However, amateurs span the range from so-called "armchair astronomers" to the very ambitious, who own science-grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15768">In [[theoretical physics]], the '''Batalin&amp;ndash;Vilkovisky''' ('''BV''') '''formalism''' (named for Igor Batalin and Grigori Vilkovisky) was developed as a method for determining the [[Faddeev&amp;ndash;Popov ghost|ghost]] structure for Lagrangian [[gauge theories]], such as gravity and [[supergravity]], whose corresponding [[Hamiltonian formalism|Hamiltonian formulation]] has constraints not related to a [[Lie algebra]] (i.e., the role of Lie algebra structure constants are played by more general structure functions). The BV formalism, based on an [[Action (physics)|action]] that contains both [[Field (physics)|fields]] and "antifields", can be thought of as a vast generalization of the original [[BRST formalism]] for [[Yang–Mills theory|pure Yang&amp;ndash;Mills]] theory to an arbitrary Lagrangian gauge theory. Other names for the Batalin&amp;ndash;Vilkovisky formalism are '''field-antifield formalism''', '''Lagrangian BRST formalism''', or '''BV–BRST formalism'''. It should not be confused with the [[Batalin&amp;ndash;Fradkin&amp;ndash;Vilkovisky formalism|Batalin&amp;ndash;Fradkin&amp;ndash;Vilkovisky (BFV) formalism]], which is the Hamiltonian counterpart.

==Batalin&amp;ndash;Vilkovisky algebras==
In mathematics, a '''Batalin&amp;ndash;Vilkovisky algebra''' is a [[Graded algebra|graded]] [[supercommutative algebra]] (with a unit 1) with a second-order nilpotent operator Δ of degree&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1. More precisely, it satisfies the identities
*&lt;math&gt;|ab| = |a| + |b| &lt;/math&gt;   (The product has degree&amp;nbsp;0)
*&lt;math&gt;|\Delta(a)| = |a| - 1    &lt;/math&gt;  (Δ has degree&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1)
*&lt;math&gt;(ab)c = a(bc)     &lt;/math&gt;  (The product is associative)
*&lt;math&gt;ab = (-1)^{|a||b|}ba   &lt;/math&gt;    (The product is (super-)commutative)
*&lt;math&gt;\Delta^2 = 0      &lt;/math&gt; (Nilpotency (of order 2))
*&lt;math&gt;\Delta(abc)-\Delta(ab)c+\Delta(a)bc-(-1)^{|a|}a\Delta(bc)-(-1)^{(|a|+1)|b|}b\Delta(ac)+(-1)^{|a|}a\Delta(b)c+(-1)^{|a|+|b|}ab\Delta(c)-\Delta(1)abc=0  &lt;/math&gt;(The Δ operator is of second order)

One often also requires normalization:

*&lt;math&gt;\Delta(1)=0  &lt;/math&gt; (normalization)

==Antibracket==
A Batalin–Vilkovisky algebra becomes a [[Gerstenhaber algebra]] if one defines the '''Gerstenhaber bracket''' by
:&lt;math&gt;(a,b) := (-1)^{\left|a\right|}\Delta(ab) - (-1)^{\left|a\right|}\Delta(a)b - a\Delta(b)+a\Delta(1)b .&lt;/math&gt;
Other names for the Gerstenhaber bracket are '''Buttin bracket''', '''antibracket''', or '''odd Poisson bracket'''. The antibracket satisfies
* &lt;math&gt;|(a,b)| = |a|+|b| - 1 &lt;/math&gt; (The antibracket (,) has degree −1)
* &lt;math&gt; (a,b) = -(-1)^{(|a|+1)(|b|+1)}(b,a) &lt;/math&gt;     (Skewsymmetry)
* &lt;math&gt; (-1)^{(|a|+1)(|c|+1)}(a,(b,c)) +   (-1)^{(|b|+1)(|a|+1)}(b,(c,a)) +  (-1)^{(|c|+1)(|b|+1)}(c,(a,b)) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; (The Jacobi identity)
* &lt;math&gt; (ab,c) = a(b,c) + (-1)^{|a||b|}b(a,c)&lt;/math&gt;     (The Poisson property;The Leibniz rule)

==Odd Laplacian==
The normalized operator is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; {\Delta}_{\rho} := \Delta-\Delta(1) . &lt;/math&gt;
It is often called the '''odd Laplacian''', in particular in the context of odd Poisson geometry. It "differentiates" the antibracket
* &lt;math&gt;  {\Delta}_{\rho}(a,b) = ({\Delta}_{\rho}(a),b) - (-1)^{\left|a\right|}(a,{\Delta}_{\rho}(b)) &lt;/math&gt;        (The &lt;math&gt;{\Delta}_{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; operator  differentiates (,))
The square &lt;math&gt;{\Delta}_{\rho}^{2}=(\Delta(1),\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; of the normalized &lt;math&gt;{\Delta}_{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; operator is a Hamiltonian vector field with odd Hamiltonian Δ(1)
* &lt;math&gt; {\Delta}_{\rho}^{2}(ab) = {\Delta}_{\rho}^{2}(a)b+ a{\Delta}_{\rho}^{2}(b) &lt;/math&gt;       (The Leibniz rule)
which is also known as the '''modular vector field'''. Assuming normalization Δ(1)=0, the odd Laplacian &lt;math&gt; {\Delta}_{\rho} &lt;/math&gt; is just the Δ operator, and the modular vector field &lt;math&gt; {\Delta}_{\rho}^{2} &lt;/math&gt; vanishes.

==Compact formulation in terms of nested commutators==
If one introduces the '''left multiplication operator''' &lt;math&gt;L_{a}&lt;/math&gt; as 
:&lt;math&gt; L_{a}(b) := ab  ,  &lt;/math&gt;
and the [[supercommutator]] [,] as 
:&lt;math&gt;[S,T]:=ST - (-1)^{\left|S\right|\left|T\right|}TS &lt;/math&gt;
for two arbitrary operators ''S'' and ''T'', then the definition of the antibracket may be written compactly as
:&lt;math&gt; (a,b) := (-1)^{\left|a\right|} [[\Delta,L_{a}],L_{b}]1  , &lt;/math&gt;
and the second order condition for Δ may be written compactly as
:&lt;math&gt; [[[\Delta,L_{a}],L_{b}],L_{c}]1 = 0   &lt;/math&gt;    (The Δ operator is of second order)
where it is understood that the pertinent operator acts on the unit element 1. In other words, &lt;math&gt; [\Delta,L_{a}] &lt;/math&gt; is a first-order (affine) operator, and &lt;math&gt; [[\Delta,L_{a}],L_{b}] &lt;/math&gt; is a zeroth-order operator.

==Master equation==
The '''classical master equation''' for an even degree element ''S'' (called the [[Action (physics)|action]]) of a Batalin–Vilkovisky algebra is the equation
:&lt;math&gt;(S,S) = 0   . &lt;/math&gt;
The '''quantum master equation''' for an even degree element ''W'' of a Batalin–Vilkovisky algebra is the equation
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta\exp \left[\frac{i}{\hbar}W\right] = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}(W,W) = i\hbar{\Delta}_{\rho}(W)+\hbar^{2}\Delta(1) . &lt;/math&gt;
Assuming normalization Δ(1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, the quantum master equation reads
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}(W,W) = i\hbar\Delta(W) . &lt;/math&gt;

==Generalized BV algebras==
In the definition of a '''generalized BV algebra''', one drops the second-order assumption for Δ. One may then define an infinite hierarchy of higher brackets of degree&amp;nbsp;−1
:&lt;math&gt; \Phi^{n}(a_{1},\ldots,a_{n}) :=  \underbrace{[[\ldots[\Delta,L_{a_{1}}],\ldots],L_{a_{n}}]}_{n~{\rm nested~commutators}}1  .   &lt;/math&gt;
The brackets are (graded) symmetric
:&lt;math&gt; \Phi^{n}(a_{\pi(1)},\ldots,a_{\pi(n)}) = (-1)^{\left|a_{\pi}\right|}\Phi^{n}(a_{1},\ldots, a_{n})    &lt;/math&gt;  (Symmetric brackets)
where &lt;math&gt;\pi\in S_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is a permutation, and &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{\left|a_{\pi}\right|}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Koszul sign]] of the permutation 
:&lt;math&gt;a_{\pi(1)}\ldots a_{\pi(n)} = (-1)^{\left|a_{\pi}\right|}a_{1}\ldots a_{n}&lt;/math&gt;.
The brackets constitute a [[homotopy Lie algebra]], also known as an &lt;math&gt;L_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; algebra, which satisfies generalized Jacobi identities 
:&lt;math&gt;  \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{1}{k!(n\!-\!k)!}\sum_{\pi\in S_{n}}(-1)^{\left|a_{\pi}\right|}\Phi^{n-k+1}\left(\Phi^{k}(a_{\pi(1)}, \ldots, a_{\pi(k)}), a_{\pi(k+1)}, \ldots, a_{\pi(n)}\right) = 0. &lt;/math&gt;  (Generalized Jacobi identities)
The first few brackets are:
* &lt;math&gt; \Phi^{0} := \Delta(1) &lt;/math&gt;      (The zero-bracket)
* &lt;math&gt; \Phi^{1}(a) := [\Delta,L_{a}]1 = \Delta(a) - \Delta(1)a =: {\Delta}_{\rho}(a) &lt;/math&gt;    (The one-bracket)
* &lt;math&gt; \Phi^{2}(a,b) := [[\Delta,L_{a}],L_{b}]1 =: (-1)^{\left|a\right|}(a,b) &lt;/math&gt;    (The two-bracket)
* &lt;math&gt; \Phi^{3}(a,b,c) := [[[\Delta,L_{a}],L_{b}],L_{c}]1 &lt;/math&gt;    (The three-bracket)
* &lt;math&gt; \vdots &lt;/math&gt;
In particular, the one-bracket &lt;math&gt; \Phi^{1}={\Delta}_{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; is the odd Laplacian, and the two-bracket &lt;math&gt; \Phi^{2}&lt;/math&gt; is the antibracket up to a sign. The first few generalized Jacobi identities are:
* &lt;math&gt; \Phi^{1}(\Phi^0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;  (&lt;math&gt;\Delta(1)&lt;/math&gt;  is &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\rho&lt;/math&gt;-closed)
* &lt;math&gt; \Phi^{2}(\Phi^{0},a)+\Phi^{1}\left(\Phi^{1}(a)\right)&lt;/math&gt;  (&lt;math&gt;\Delta(1)&lt;/math&gt;  is the Hamiltonian for the modular vector field &lt;math&gt;{\Delta}_{\rho}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt; \Phi^{3}(\Phi^{0},a,b) + \Phi^{2}\left(\Phi^{1}(a),b\right)+(-1)^{|a|}\Phi^{2}\left(a,\Phi^{1}(b)\right) +\Phi^{1}\left(\Phi^{2}(a,b)\right) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;  (The &lt;math&gt; {\Delta}_{\rho} &lt;/math&gt; operator differentiates (,) generalized)
* &lt;math&gt; \Phi^{4}(\Phi^{0},a,b,c) + {\rm Jac}(a,b,c)+ \Phi^{1}\left(\Phi^{3}(a,b,c)\right) + \Phi^{3}\left(\Phi^{1}(a),b,c\right) + (-1)^{\left|a\right|}\Phi^{3}\left(a,\Phi^{1}(b),c\right) +(-1)^{\left|a\right|+\left|b\right|}\Phi^{3}\left(a,b,\Phi^{1}(c)\right) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;  (The generalized Jacobi identity)
* &lt;math&gt; \vdots &lt;/math&gt;
where the [[Jacobiator]] for the two-bracket &lt;math&gt;\Phi^{2}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Jac}(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}) := 
\frac{1}{2} \sum_{\pi\in S_{3}}(-1)^{\left|a_{\pi}\right|}
\Phi^{2}\left(\Phi^{2}(a_{\pi(1)},a_{\pi(2)}),a_{\pi(3)}\right) .  &lt;/math&gt;

==BV ''n''-algebras==
The Δ operator is by definition of '''n'th order''' if and only if the (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-bracket &lt;math&gt; \Phi^{n+1} &lt;/math&gt; vanishes. In that case, one speaks of a '''BV n-algebra'''. Thus a '''BV 2-algebra''' is by definition just a BV algebra. The Jacobiator &lt;math&gt; {\rm Jac}(a,b,c)=0 &lt;/math&gt; vanishes within a BV algebra, which means that the antibracket here satisfies the Jacobi identity. A '''BV 1-algebra''' that satisfies normalization Δ(1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is the same as a [[differential graded algebra|differential graded algebra (DGA)]] with differential Δ. A BV 1-algebra has vanishing antibracket.

==Odd Poisson manifold with volume density==
Let there be given an (n|n) [[supermanifold]] with an odd Poisson bi-vector &lt;math&gt; \pi^{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and a Berezin volume density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, also known as a '''P-structure''' and an '''S-structure''', respectively. Let the local coordinates be called &lt;math&gt;x^{i}&lt;/math&gt;. Let the derivatives &lt;math&gt; \partial_{i}f &lt;/math&gt; and 
:&lt;math&gt; f\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\partial}_{i}:=(-1)^{\left|x^{i}\right|(|f|+1)}\partial_{i}f &lt;/math&gt;
denote the [[left derivative|left]] and [[right derivative]] of a function ''f'' wrt. &lt;math&gt;x^{i}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. The odd Poisson bi-vector &lt;math&gt; \pi^{ij}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies more precisely
* &lt;math&gt; \left|\pi^{ij}\right| = \left|x^{i}\right| + \left|x^{j}\right| -1  &lt;/math&gt;   (The odd Poisson structure has degree&amp;nbsp;–1)
* &lt;math&gt; \pi^{ji} = -(-1)^{(\left|x^{i}\right|+1)(\left|x^{j}\right|+1)} \pi^{ij} &lt;/math&gt;       (Skewsymmetry)
* &lt;math&gt; (-1)^{(\left|x^{i}\right|+1)(\left|x^{k}\right|+1)}\pi^{i\ell}\partial_{\ell}\pi^{jk} + {\rm cyclic}(i,j,k) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;    (The Jacobi identity)
Under change of coordinates &lt;math&gt;x^{i} \to x^{\prime i} &lt;/math&gt; the odd Poisson bi-vector &lt;math&gt; \pi^{ij}&lt;/math&gt; 
and Berezin volume density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; transform as
* &lt;math&gt; \pi^{\prime k\ell} = x^{\prime k}\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\partial}_{i} \pi^{ij} \partial_{j}x^{\prime \ell} &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\rho^{\prime} = \rho/{\rm sdet}(\partial_{i}x^{\prime j}) &lt;/math&gt;
where ''sdet'' denotes the [[superdeterminant]], also known as the Berezinian.
Then the '''odd Poisson bracket''' is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; (f,g) := f\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\partial}_{i}\pi^{ij}\partial_{j}g . &lt;/math&gt;
A '''Hamiltonian vector field''' &lt;math&gt; X_{f}&lt;/math&gt;  with Hamiltonian ''f'' can be defined as
:&lt;math&gt; X_{f}[g] := (f,g) .&lt;/math&gt;
The (super-)[[divergence]] of a vector field &lt;math&gt; X=X^{i}\partial_{i} &lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; {\rm div}_{\rho} X := \frac{(-1)^{\left|x^{i}\right|(|X|+1)}}{\rho} \partial_{i}(\rho X^{i}) &lt;/math&gt;
Recall that Hamiltonian vector fields are divergencefree in even Poisson geometry because of Liouville's Theorem. 
In odd Poisson geometry the corresponding statement does not hold. The '''odd Laplacian''' &lt;math&gt; {\Delta}_{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; measures the failure of Liouville's Theorem. Up to a sign factor, it is defined as one half the divergence of the corresponding Hamiltonian vector field,  
:&lt;math&gt; {\Delta}_{\rho}(f) := \frac{(-1)^{\left|f\right|}}{2}{\rm div}_{\rho} X_{f} = \frac{(-1)^{\left|x^{i}\right|}}{2\rho}\partial_{i}\rho \pi^{ij}\partial_{j}f.&lt;/math&gt;
The odd Poisson structure &lt;math&gt; \pi^{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and Berezin volume density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; are said to be '''compatible''' if the modular vector field &lt;math&gt; {\Delta}_{\rho}^{2} &lt;/math&gt; vanishes. In that case the '''odd Laplacian''' &lt;math&gt; {\Delta}_{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; is a BV Δ operator with normalization Δ(1)=0. The corresponding BV algebra is the algebra of functions.

== Odd symplectic manifold ==
If the odd Poisson bi-vector &lt;math&gt; \pi^{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is invertible, one has an odd [[Symplectic geometry|symplectic]] manifold. In that case, there exists an '''odd Darboux Theorem'''. That is, there exist local '''Darboux coordinates''', i.e., coordinates  &lt;math&gt; q^{1}, \ldots, q^{n} &lt;/math&gt;, and momenta &lt;math&gt; p_{1},\ldots, p_{n} &lt;/math&gt;, of degree
:&lt;math&gt; \left|q^{i}\right|+\left|p_{i}\right|=1, &lt;/math&gt;
such that the odd Poisson bracket is on Darboux form
:&lt;math&gt; (q^{i},p_{j}) = \delta^{i}_{j} . &lt;/math&gt;
In [[theoretical physics]], the coordinates &lt;math&gt;q^{i} &lt;/math&gt; and momenta &lt;math&gt;p_{j} &lt;/math&gt; are called '''fields''' and '''antifields''', and are typically denoted &lt;math&gt;\phi^{i} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi^{*}_{j} &lt;/math&gt;, respectively.
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\pi} := (-1)^{\left|q^{i}\right|}\frac{\partial}{\partial q^{i}}\frac{\partial}{\partial p_{i}}  &lt;/math&gt;
acts on the vector space of [[semidensities]], and is a globally well-defined operator on the atlas of Darboux neighborhoods. Khudaverdian's &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\pi}&lt;/math&gt; operator depends only on the P-structure. It is manifestly nilpotent &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\pi}^{2}=0&lt;/math&gt;, and of degree&amp;nbsp;−1. Nevertheless, it is technically '''not''' a BV Δ operator as the vector space of semidensities has no multiplication. (The product of two semidensities is a density rather than a semidensity.) Given a fixed density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, one may construct a nilpotent BV Δ operator as
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta(f) :=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\rho}}\Delta_{\pi}(\sqrt{\rho}f),&lt;/math&gt;
whose corresponding BV algebra is the algebra of functions, or equivalently, [[scalar (physics)|scalar]]s. The odd symplectic structure &lt;math&gt; \pi^{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; are compatible if and only if Δ(1) is an odd constant.

==Examples==
* The [[Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket]] for multi-vector fields is an example of an antibracket.
* If ''L'' is a Lie superalgebra, and Π is the operator exchanging the even and odd parts of a super space, then the [[symmetric algebra]] of Π(''L'') (the "exterior algebra" of ''L'') is a Batalin–Vilkovisky algebra with Δ given by the usual differential used to compute Lie algebra [[cohomology]].

The ancient record on Earth provides an opportunity to see what geochemical signatures are produced by microbial life and how these signatures are preserved over geologic time. Some related disciplines such as [[geochemistry]], [[geobiology]], and [[geomicrobiology]] often use biosignatures to determine if living [[organism]]s are or were present in a sample. These possible biosignatures include: (a) [[microfossils]] and [[stromatolites]]; (b) molecular structures ([[biomarkers]]) and [[Isotope|isotopic compositions]] of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen in [[organic matter]]; (c) multiple sulfur and oxygen isotope ratios of minerals; and (d) abundance relationships and isotopic compositions of redox sensitive metals (e.g., Fe, Mo, Cr, and rare earth elements).&lt;ref name='PSARC'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://php.scripts.psu.edu/dept/psarc/index.php?page=executive-summary | title = SIGNATURES OF LIFE FROM EARTH AND BEYOND | accessdate = 2011-01-14 | year = 2009 | work = Penn State Astrobiology Research Center (PSARC) | publisher = Penn State}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/articles/2008/7/30/reading-archaean-biosignatures/ | title = Reading Archaean Biosignatures | accessdate = 2014-11-23 | first1 = David | last1 = Tenenbaum | date = July 30, 2008 | publisher = NASA | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141129094552/http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/articles/2008/7/30/reading-archaean-biosignatures/ | archivedate = November 29, 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the particular [[fatty acids]] measured in a sample can indicate which types of [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[archaea]] live in that environment. Another example are the long-chain [[fatty alcohol]]s with more than 23 atoms that are produced by [[plankton]]ic [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberlipid.org/simple/simp0003.htm Fatty alcohols]&lt;/ref&gt; When used in this sense, geochemists often prefer the term [[biomarker]]. Another example is the presence of straight-chain [[lipids]] in the form of [[alkanes]], [[alcohols]] an [[fatty acids]] with 20-36 [[carbon]] atoms in soils or sediments. [[Peat]] deposits are an indication of originating from the [[epicuticular wax]] of higher [[plant]]s.

Life processes may produce a range of biosignatures such as [[nucleic acids]], [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s, [[amino acid]]s, [[kerogen]]-like material and various morphological features that are detectable in rocks and sediments.&lt;ref name=Beegle &gt;{{cite journal|title=A Concept for NASA's Mars 2016 Astrobiology Field Laboratory |journal=Astrobiology|date=August 2007|first=Luther W.|last=Beegle|volume=7 |issue=4|pages=545–577|id= |url=http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/ast.2007.0153?cookieSet=1|accessdate=2009-07-20|doi=10.1089/ast.2007.0153|postscript=. |pmid=17723090 |bibcode=2007AsBio...7..545B|first2=Michael G.|last2=Wilson |last3=Abilleira|first3=Fernando|last4=Jordan|first4=James F.|last5=Wilson|first5=Gregory R.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Microbes]] often interact with geochemical processes, leaving features in the rock record indicative of biosignatures. For example, bacterial micrometer-sized pores in [[carbonate rock]]s resemble inclusions under transmitted light, but have distinct size, shapes and patterns (swirling or dendritic) and are distributed differently from common fluid inclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Micrometer-scale porosity as a biosignature in carbonate crusts | last1 = Bosak | journal = Geology | date = May 18, 2004 | first = Tanja Bosak | author2 = Virginia Souza-Egipsy | author3 = Frank A.

==In astrobiology==

[[Astrobiology|Astrobiological exploration]] is founded upon the premise that biosignatures encountered in space will be recognizable as [[extraterrestrial life]]. The usefulness of a biosignature is determined, not only by the probability of life creating it, but also by the improbability of nonbiological (abiotic) processes producing it.&lt;ref name=astrobiology&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/roadmap/g5.html |title=Understand the evolutionary mechanisms and environmental limits of life |accessdate=2009-07-13 |last=Rothschild |first=Lynn |date=September 2003 |publisher=NASA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126083203/http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/roadmap/g5.html |archivedate=2011-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concluding that evidence of an extraterrestrial life form (past or present) has been discovered, requires proving that a possible biosignature was produced by the activities or remains of life.&lt;ref name=SSG /&gt; As with most scientific discoveries, discovery of a biosignature will require of evidence building up until no other explanation exists.

Possible examples of a biosignature might be complex [[Organic compound|organic molecules]] and/or structures whose formation is virtually unachievable in the absence of life. For example, cellular and extracellular morphologies, [[biomolecule]]s in rocks, bio-organic molecular structures, [[chirality]], [[Biogenic silica|biogenic minerals]], biogenic stable isotope patterns in minerals and organic compounds, atmospheric gases, and remotely detectable features on planetary surfaces, such as [[photosynthetic pigment]]s, etc.&lt;ref name=astrobiology /&gt;

;Categories
In general, biosignatures and habitable environment signatures can be grouped into ten broad categories:&lt;ref name='NASA strategy 2015'/&gt;
#Stable [[isotope]] patterns: Isotopic evidence or patterns that require biological processes.
#Chemistry: Chemical features that require biological activity.
#[[Organic matter]]: Organics formed by biological processes.
#Minerals: Minerals or biomineral-phases whose composition and/or morphology indicate biological activity (e.g., [[Magnetite|biomagnetite]]).
#Microscopic structures and textures: Biologically formed cements, microtextures, microfossils, and films.
#Macroscopic physical structures and textures: Structures that indicate microbial ecosystems, biofilms (e.g., [[stromatolite]]s), or [[fossil]]s of larger organisms.
#Temporal variability: Variations in time of atmospheric gases, reflectivity, or macroscopic appearance that indicate the presence of life.
#Surface reflectance features: Large-scale reflectance features due to biological pigments, which could be detected remotely.
#Atmospheric gases: Gases formed by metabolic and/or aqueous processes, which may be present on a planet-wide scale.
#[[Technosignature]]s: Signatures that indicate a technologically advanced civilization.

===Chemical===

No single compound will prove life once existed. Rather, it will be distinctive patterns present in any organic compounds showing a process of selection.&lt;ref name='PhysOrg Cousins 2018'&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2018-01-rover-life-mars-proveit.html Rover could discover life on Mars – here's what it would take to prove it]. Claire Cousins, ''PhysOrg''. 5 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[membrane lipid]]s left behind by degraded cells will be concentrated, have a limited size range, and comprise an even number of carbons. Similarly, life only uses left-handed amino acids.&lt;ref name='PhysOrg Cousins 2018'/&gt; Biosignatures need not be chemical, however, and can also be suggested by a distinctive [[magnetic]] biosignature.&lt;ref name="Wall-20111213"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Mars Life Hunt Could Look for Magnetic Clues |url=http://www.space.com/13911-mars-life-search-magnetic-signatures.html |date=13 December 2011 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=2011-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Mars]], surface oxidants and UV radiation will have altered or destroyed organic molecules at or near the surface.&lt;ref name='Biosignatures 2011'/&gt; One issue that may add ambiguity in such a search is the fact that, throughout Martian history, abiogenic organic-rich [[Chondrite|chondritic meteorite]]s have undoubtedly rained upon the Martian surface. At the same time, strong [[Oxidizing agent|oxidants]] in [[Martian soil]] along with exposure to [[ionizing radiation]] might alter or destroy molecular signatures from meteorites or organisms.&lt;ref name='Biosignatures 2011'/&gt; An alternative approach would be to seek concentrations of buried crystalline minerals, such as [[clay]]s and [[evaporite]]s, which may protect organic matter from the destructive effects of [[ionizing radiation]] and strong oxidants.&lt;ref name='Biosignatures 2011'/&gt; The search for Martian biosignatures has become
more promising due to the discovery that surface and near-surface aqueous environments existed on Mars at the same time when biological organic matter was being preserved in ancient aqueous sediments on Earth.&lt;ref name='Biosignatures 2011'/&gt;

===Morphology===

[[File:ALH84001 structures.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Some researchers suggested that these microscopic structures on the Martian [[ALH84001]] meteorite could be fossilized bacteria.&lt;ref name=disbelief&gt;{{cite web | title=After 10 years, few believe life on Mars | url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2006-08-06-mars-life_x.htm | last=Crenson | first=Matt | publisher=[[Associated Press]] (on usatoday.com) | date=2006-08-06 | accessdate=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="life"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKay |first=David S. |year=1996 |title=Search for Past Life on Mars: Possible Relic Biogenic Activity in Martian Meteorite ALH84001 |journal=Science |pmid=8688069 |volume=273 |issue=5277 |pages=924–930 |doi=10.1126/science.273.5277.924 |url= |accessdate= |bibcode=1996Sci...273..924M|first2=Everett K.|last2= Gibson Jr|last3=Thomas-Keprta |first3=Kathie L. |last4=Vali |first4=Hojatollah |last5=Romanek |first5=Christopher S. |last6=Clemett |first6=Simon J. |last7=Chillier |first7=Xavier D.

Another possible biosignature might be [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] since the shape and size of certain objects may potentially indicate the presence of past or present life. For example, microscopic [[magnetite]] crystals in the Martian [[meteorite]] [[ALH84001]] were the longest-debated of several potential biosignatures in that specimen because it was believed until recently that only bacteria could create crystals of their specific shape.   For example, the possible [[Biomineralisation|biomineral]] studied in the Martian [[ALH84001|ALH84001 meteorite]] includes putative microbial [[fossils]], tiny rock-like structures whose shape was a potential biosignature because it resembled known bacteria. Most scientists ultimately concluded that these were far too small to be fossilized [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. A consensus that has emerged from these discussions, and is now seen as a critical requirement, is the demand for further lines of evidence in addition to any morphological data that supports such extraordinary claims.&lt;ref name=SSG /&gt; Currently, the scientific consensus is that "morphology alone cannot be used unambiguously as a tool for primitive life detection."&lt;ref name=morphology&gt;{{cite journal | title = Morphological behavior of inorganic precipitation systems – Instruments, Methods, and Missions for Astrobiology II | journal = SPIE Proceedings | date = December 30, 1999 | first = Juan-Manuel Garcia-Ruiz | volume = Proc.

The atmospheric properties of exoplanets are of particular importance, as atmospheres provide the most likely observables for the near future, including habitability indicators and biosignatures.

The presence of [[Atmospheric methane|methane in the atmosphere]] of [[Mars]] indicates that there must be an active source on the planet, as it is an unstable [[gas]].

The [[Viking Lander|''Viking'' missions]] to Mars in the 1970s conducted the first experiments which were explicitly designed to look for biosignatures on another planet.  Each of the two [[Viking program|''Viking'' landers]] carried three [[Viking Biological Experiments|life-detection experiments]] which looked for signs of [[metabolism]]; however, the results were declared inconclusive.&lt;ref name=Beegle /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levin, G and P.

{{short description|electrochemical process}}
In electrochemistry, '''CO stripping''' is a special process of [[voltammetry]] where a monolayer of [[carbon monoxide]] already adsorbed on the surface of an electrocatalyst is electrochemically [[Redox|oxidized]] and thus removed from the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schlaup|first1=Christian|last2=Horch|first2=Sebastian|title=Study of underpotential deposited Cu layers on Pt(111) and their stability against CO and CO2 in perchloric acid|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2013/CP/c3cp52649f#!divAbstract|website=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|accessdate=9 January 2018|language=en|doi=10.1039/C3CP52649F|date=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A well-known process of this type is CO stripping on [[Platinum on carbon|Pt/C electrocatalysts]] in which the electrooxidation peak occurs somewhere between 0.5 to 0.9 V depending on the characteristics and structural properties of the specimen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binninger|first1=T.|last2=Fabbri|first2=E.|last3=Kötz|first3=R.|last4=Schmidt|first4=T.

'''Chauffeur's fracture''', also known as '''Hutchinson fracture''', is a type of [[fracture]] of the [[forearm]], specifically the [[radial styloid process]]. The injury is typically caused by compression of the [[scaphoid]] bone of the hand against the [[Radial styloid process|styloid process]] of the [[distal radius]]. It can be caused by falling onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH). Treatment is often [[open reduction and internal fixation]], which is surgical realignment of the bone fragments and fixation with pins, screws, or plates.

The name originates from early [[chauffeur]]s who sustained these injuries when the car back-fired while the chauffeur was [[Starter (engine)|hand-cranking]] to start the car. The back-fire forced the crank backward into the chauffeur's palm and produced the characteristic styloid fracture.&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, A: ''Orthopaedic Imaging: A Practical Approach'', page 170.

This is a comparison of standards of [[mobile phone]]s. A new [[List of mobile phone generations|generation]] of cellular standards has appeared approximately every tenth year since [[1G]] systems were introduced in 1979 and the early to mid-1980s.

==Issues==
[[Global System for Mobile Communications]] (GSM, around 80–85% market share) and [[IS-95]] (around 10–15% market share) were the two most prevalent 2G mobile communication technologies in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmworld.com/news/statistics/pdf/gsma_stats_q1_07.pdf |title=Subscriber statistics end Q1 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927162249/http://www.gsmworld.com/news/statistics/pdf/gsma_stats_q1_07.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 3G, the most prevalent technology was [[UMTS]] with [[CDMA-2000]] in close contention.

All radio access technologies have to solve the same problems: to divide the finite [[RF spectrum]] among multiple users as efficiently as possible. GSM uses [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]] and [[Frequency-division multiple access|FDMA]] for user and cell separation. UMTS, IS-95 and CDMA-2000 use [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]]. [[WiMAX]] and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] use [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|OFDM]].

* [[Time division multiple access|Time-division multiple access (TDMA)]]  provides multiuser access by chopping up the channel into sequential time slices. Each user of the channel takes turns to transmit and receive signals. In reality, only one person is actually using the channel at a specific moment.  This is analogous to [[time-sharing]] on a large computer server.
* [[Frequency division multiple access|Frequency-division multiple access (FDMA)]] provides multiuser access by separating the used frequencies. This is used in GSM to separate cells, which then use TDMA to separate users within the cell.
* [[CDMA|Code-division multiple access (CDMA)]]  This uses a [[digital modulation]] called [[spread spectrum]] which spreads the voice data over a very wide channel in [[pseudorandom number|pseudorandom]] fashion using a user or cell specific pseudorandom code. The receiver undoes the randomization to collect the bits together and produce the original data. As the codes are pseudorandom and selected in such a way as to cause minimal interference to one another, multiple users can talk at the same time and multiple cells can share the same frequency. This causes an added signal noise forcing all users to use more power, which in exchange decreases cell range and battery life.
* [[Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access]] (OFDMA) uses bundling of multiple small frequency bands that are orthogonal to one another to provide for separation of users. The users are multiplexed in the frequency domain by allocating specific sub-bands to individual users. This is often enhanced by also performing TDMA and changing the allocation periodically so that different users get different sub-bands at different times.

In theory, CDMA, TDMA and FDMA have exactly the same spectral efficiency but practically, each has its own challenges – power control in the case of CDMA, timing in the case of TDMA, and frequency generation/filtering in the case of FDMA.

For a classic example for understanding the fundamental difference of TDMA and CDMA, imagine a cocktail party where couples are talking to each other in a single room.  The room represents the available bandwidth:

:TDMA: A speaker takes turns talking to a listener. The speaker talks for a short time and then stops to let another couple talk. There is never more than one speaker talking in the room, no one has to worry about two conversations mixing. The drawback is that it limits the practical number of discussions in the room (bandwidth wise).

:CDMA: any speaker can talk at any time; however each uses a different language. Each listener can only understand the language of their partner.  As more and more couples talk, the background noise (representing the ''noise floor'') gets louder, but because of the difference in languages, conversations do not mix. The drawback is that at some point, one cannot talk any louder. After this if the noise still rises (more people join the party/cell) the listener cannot make out what the talker is talking about without coming closer to the talker. In effect, CDMA cell coverage decreases as the number of active users increases. This is called cell breathing.

== Strengths and weaknesses of IS-95 and GSM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/tut/p/id/7107 | title = IS-95 (CDMA) and GSM(TDMA) | accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==

=== Advantages of GSM ===

* Less signal deterioration inside buildings.
* Ability to use [[Cellular repeater|repeater]]s.
* [[Talktime]] is generally higher in GSM phones due to the pulse nature of transmission.
* The availability of [[Subscriber Identity Module]]s allows users to switch networks and handsets at will, aside from a [[SIM lock|subsidy lock]].
* GSM [[List of mobile network operators|covers virtually all parts of the world]] so international [[roaming]] is not a problem.
* The much bigger number of [[List of mobile network operators|subscribers globally]] creates a better [[network effect]] for GSM handset makers, carriers and end users.

=== Disadvantages of GSM ===

* Interferes with some electronics, especially certain audio amplifiers.
* Intellectual property is concentrated among a few industry participants, creating barriers to entry for new entrants and limiting competition among phone manufacturers. Situation is however worse in CDMA-based systems like IS-95, where Qualcomm is the major IP holder.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}
* GSM has a fixed maximum cell site range of 120&amp;nbsp;km,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/electronics/computer-electronics-manufacturing/6838169-1.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123014240/http://www.allbusiness.com/electronics/computer-electronics-manufacturing/6838169-1.html |archive-date=23 January 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is imposed by [[Timing advance|technical limitations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcx.com/sites/faq.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509174612/http://www.arcx.com/sites/faq.htm |archivedate=9 May 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is expanded from the old limit of 35&amp;nbsp;km.

=== Advantages of IS-95 ===

* Capacity is IS-95's biggest asset; it can accommodate more users per [[MHz]] of [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] than any other technology.
* Has no built-in limit to the number of concurrent users.
* Uses precise clocks that do not limit the distance a tower can cover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcx.com/sites/faq.htm Frequently Asked PCS Questions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509174612/http://www.arcx.com/sites/faq.htm |date=9 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Consumes less power and covers large areas so cell size in IS-95 is larger.
* Able to produce a reasonable call with lower signal (cell phone reception) levels.
* Uses [[Soft handover|soft handoff]], reducing the likelihood of dropped calls.
* IS-95's variable rate voice coders reduce the rate being transmitted when speaker is not talking, which allows the channel to be packed more efficiently.
* Has a well-defined path to higher data rates.

=== Disadvantages of IS-95 ===

* Most technologies are patented and must be licensed from [[Qualcomm]].
* ''Breathing'' of base stations, where coverage area shrinks under load. As the number of subscribers using a particular site goes up, the range of that site goes down.
* Because IS-95 towers interfere with each other, they are normally installed on much shorter towers.  Because of this, IS-95 may not perform well in hilly terrain.
* USSD, PTT, concatenated/E-sms are not supported by IS-95/CDMA
* IS-95 covers a smaller portion of the world, and IS-95 phones are generally unable to roam internationally.
* Manufacturers are often hesitant to release IS-95 devices due to the smaller market, so features are sometimes late in coming to IS-95 devices.
* Even barring [[SIM lock|subsidy locks]], CDMA phones are linked by [[Electronic Serial Number|ESN]] to a specific network, thus phones are typically not portable across providers.

A '''compliance cost''' is expenditure of time or money in conforming with government requirements such as [[legislation]] or [[regulation]].  For example, people or organisations registered for [[value added tax]] have the extra burden of having to keep detailed records of all input tax and output tax to facilitate the completion of VAT returns.  This may necessitate them having to employ someone skilled in this field, which would be regarded a compliance cost.

Compliance costs normally include all costs associated with obeying the law, including planning and administration, in addition to the direct time and money spent filing paperwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Compliance Costs and Tax  Complexity|url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/topic/96.html|work=Tax Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bylaws==
Bylaws with a high cost of compliance can suffer from not being taken seriously &amp; often being broken. For example, jurisdictions which ban smoking in all public areas theoretically have higher rates of people smoking in public areas as it would be inconvenient for them to go all the way home. Lawmakers therefore need to consider cost of compliance.

==Tax compliance==
Compliance with tax laws, such as [[income tax]] or [[sales tax]] legislation, is a common topic of political debate, primarily because these taxes affect the majority of citizens in a society. By contrast, environmental regulations, such as those on [[sulfur dioxide]] [[Air pollution|emissions]], only affect a minority of businesses within an economy.

{{Refimprove|date=February 2013}}
The '''Coriolis frequency''' ''ƒ'', also called the '''Coriolis parameter''' or '''Coriolis coefficient''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vallis|first=Geoffrey K.|title=Atmospheric and oceanic fluid dynamics : fundamentals and large-scale circulation|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-84969-2|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is equal to twice the rotation rate ''Ω'' of the Earth multiplied by the [[sine]] of the [[latitude]] ''φ''. 

:&lt;math&gt;f = 2 \Omega \sin \varphi.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Earth's_rotation#Rotation period|rotation rate of the Earth]] (''Ω''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7.2921&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;5&lt;/sup&gt; rad/s) can be calculated as 2''π''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''T''&amp;nbsp;radians per second, where ''T''&amp;nbsp;is the rotation [[period (physics)|period]] of the Earth which is one [[Sidereal day|''sidereal'' day]] (23&amp;nbsp;hr&amp;nbsp;56&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;4.1&amp;nbsp;s). In the midlatitudes, the typical value for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is about 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;4&lt;/sup&gt; rad/s.  [[inertial wave|Inertial oscillations]] on the surface of the earth have this [[frequency]].  These [[oscillation]]s are the result of the [[Coriolis effect]].

Consider a body (for example a fixed volume of atmosphere) at latitude &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; moving at velocity &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; in the earth's rotating reference frame. In the local reference frame of the body, the vertical direction is parallel to the radial vector pointing from the center of the earth to the location of the body and the horizontal direction is perpendicular to this vertical direction (and hence in the [[meridional]] direction). The Coriolis force (proportional to &lt;math&gt; 2 \, \boldsymbol{ \Omega \times v}&lt;/math&gt;), however, is perpendicular to the plane containing  both  the earth's angular velocity vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ \Omega}&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt; |\boldsymbol{ \Omega}| = \Omega &lt;/math&gt;) and the body's own velocity in the rotating reference frame &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the Coriolis force is always at an angle &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; with the local vertical direction. The local horizontal direction of the Coriolis force is thus &lt;math&gt;\Omega \sin \varphi&lt;/math&gt;. This force acts to move the body along [[longitudes]] or in the meridional directions.

Suppose the body is moving with a velocity &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; such that the centripetal and Coriolis (due to &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\Omega} &lt;/math&gt;) forces on it are balanced. We then have

:&lt;math&gt; v^2/r= 2 (\Omega \sin \varphi) v&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; is the radius of curvature of the path of object (defined by &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt;). Replacing &lt;math&gt; v = r\omega &lt;/math&gt; we obtain 

:&lt;math&gt;f = \omega = 2 \Omega \sin \varphi. &lt;/math&gt;

Thus the Coriolis parameter, &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;, is the angular velocity or frequency required to maintain a body at a fixed circle of latitude or zonal region. If the Coriolis parameter is large, the effect of the earth's rotation on the body is significant since it will need a larger angular frequency to stay in equilibrium with the Coriolis forces. Alternatively, if the Coriolis parameter is small, the effect of the earth's rotation is small since only a small fraction of the centripetal force on the body is canceled by the Coriolis force. Thus the magnitude of &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; strongly affects the relevant dynamics contributing to the body's motion. These considerations are captured in the nondimensionalized [[Rossby number]].

In stability calculations, the rate of change of &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; along the meridional direction becomes significant. This is called the [[Rossby parameter]] and is usually denoted

:&lt;math&gt; \beta = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}  &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; is the in the local direction of increasing meridian. This parameter becomes important, for example, in calculations involving [[Rossby waves]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1728">'''Cyanocarbons''' are a group of [[chemical compound]]s that contain several [[cyanide]] [[functional group]]s.  Such substances generally are classified as [[organic compound]]s, since they are formally derived from [[hydrocarbon]]s by replacing one or more [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s with a cyanide group.&lt;ref name=Wbs&gt;Webster, Owen W. "Cyanocarbons: a classic example of discovery-driven research" Journal of Polymer Science, Part A: Polymer Chemistry 2001, volume, 40, pp. 210-221. {{DOI|10.1002/pola.10087}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parent member is C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (tetracyanomethane, also known as carbon tetracyanide).  Organic chemists often refer to cyanides as [[nitrile]]s.

In general, cyanide is an electronegative substituent. Thus, for example, cyanide-substituted [[carboxylic acid]]s tend to be stronger than the parents. The cyanide group can also stabilize anions by delocalizing negative [[electric charge|charge]] as revealed by [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance]] structures.

==Definition and examples==
''Cyanocarbons are organic compounds bearing enough cyano functional groups to significantly alter their chemical properties.''&lt;ref name=Wbs/&gt;

Important cyanocarbons:
* [[Tetracyanoethylene]], which readily reduces to a stable anion, unlike most [[ethene]] derivatives
* [[Pentacyanocyclopentadiene]], which forms a stable anion by ionization of the C-H bond.
* [[Tetracyanoethylene oxide]], an electrophilic [[epoxide]] that undergoes ready scission of its C-C bond.
* [[Tetracyanoquinodimethane]], C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-1,4-(C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a powerful electron acceptor.
* [[Cyanoform]] (tricyanomethane), (NC)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH

[[Image:Sacrobosco Lunar eclipse.jpg|thumb|A [[volvelle]] from a sixteenth-century edition of [[Johannes de Sacrobosco|Sacrobosco]]'s ''De Sphaera''.]]

'''''De sphaera mundi''''' ([[Latin]] title meaning ''On the Sphere of the World'', sometimes rendered ''The Sphere of the Cosmos''; the Latin title is also given as '''''Tractatus de sphaera''''', '''''Textus de sphaera''''', or simply '''''De sphaera''''') is a [[medieval]] introduction to the basic elements of [[astronomy]] written by [[Johannes de Sacrobosco]] (John of Holywood) c. 1230. Based heavily on [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'', and drawing additional ideas from [[Islamic astronomy]], it was one of the most influential works of pre-[[Copernican Revolution|Copernican]] astronomy in Europe.

==Reception==
Sacrobosco's ''De sphaera mundi'' was the most successful of several competing thirteenth-century textbooks on this topic. It was used in [[university|universities]] for hundreds of years and the [[manuscript]] copied many times before the invention of the [[printing press]]; hundreds of manuscript copies have survived. The first printed edition appeared in 1472 in [[Ferrara]], and at least 84 editions were printed in the next two hundred years. The work was frequently supplemented with commentaries on the original text. The number of copies and commentaries reflects its importance as a university text.&lt;ref&gt;Olaf Pedersen, "In Quest of Sacrobosco", ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', 16 (1985): 175-221.  Pedersen identifies 35 printings in Venice, another 35 in Paris, and more in 14 other cities throughout Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The 'sphere of the world' is not the earth but the heavens, and Sacrobosco quotes [[Theodosius of Bithynia|Theodosius]] saying it is a solid body. It is divided into nine parts: the "first moved" (''[[primum mobile]]''), the sphere of the fixed stars (the [[firmament]]), and the seven planets, [[Saturn]], [[Jupiter]], [[Mars]], the [[sun]], [[Venus]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and the [[moon]]. There is a 'right' sphere and an oblique sphere: the right sphere is only observed by those at the equator (if there are such people), everyone else sees the oblique sphere. There are two movements: one of the heavens from east to west on its axis through the [[North Pole|Arctic]] and [[South Pole|Antarctic poles]], the other of the inferior spheres at 23° in the opposite direction on their own axes.

The world, or universe, is divided into two parts: the elementary and the ethereal. The elementary consists of four parts: the earth, about which is water, then air, then fire, reaching up to the moon. Above this is the ethereal which is immutable and called the '[[fifth essence]]' by the philosophers. All are mobile except heavy earth which is the center of the world.

===The universe as a machine===
Sacrobosco spoke of the universe as the ''machina mundi'', the machine of the world, suggesting that the reported eclipse of the Sun at the crucifixion of Jesus was a disturbance of the order of that machine. This concept is similar to the [[clockwork universe]] analogy that became very popular centuries later, during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;John of Sacrobosco, ''On the Sphere'', quoted in Edward Grant, ''A Source Book in Medieval Science,'' (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Pr., 1974), p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spherical Earth===
[[Image:Sacrobosco-1550-B3r-detail01.jpg|thumb|upright|Picture from a 1550 edition of ''De sphaera''.]]
Though principally about the universe, ''De sphaera'' contains a clear description of the [[Earth]] as a sphere which agrees with widespread opinion in Europe during the higher Middle Ages, in contrast to statements of some 19th- and 20th-century historians that medieval scholars thought the [[Myth of the Flat Earth|Earth was flat]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey Burton Russell]], ''[[Inventing the Flat Earth]]'' (New York: Praeger, 1991): 19, 26–27. {{ISBN|0-275-93956-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As proof, he uses the fact that stars rise and set sooner for those in the east, and lunar eclipses happen earlier; that stars near the North Pole are visible to those further north and those in the south can see different ones;  that at sea one can see further by climbing up the mast; and that water seeks its natural shape which is round, as a drop.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3051">The '''Fiocruz Genome Comparison Project''' is a collaborative effort involving [[Brazil]]'s [[Oswaldo Cruz Institute]] and [[IBM]]'s [[World Community Grid]], designed to produce a [[database]] comparing the [[gene]]s from many [[genome]]s with each other using SSEARCH.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biology.wustl.edu/gcg/ssearch.html SSEARCH webpage].&lt;/ref&gt; The program SSEARCH performs a rigorous [[Smith–Waterman algorithm|Smith–Waterman alignment]] between a [[protein sequence]] and another protein sequence, a protein database, a [[DNA]] or a DNA library.


The nature of the computation in the project allows it to easily take advantage of [[distributed computing]]. This, along with the likely humanitarian benefits of the research, has led the [[World Community Grid]] (a distributed computing grid that uses idle computer clock time) to run the Fiocruz project. All products are in the public domain by contract with WCG.

==Description==
The problem is that a very large information body (structural, functional, cross-references, etc.) is attached to protein database entries. Once entered the information is rarely updated or corrected. This annotation of predicted protein function is often incomplete, uses non-standard nomenclature or can be incorrect when cross referenced from previous sometimes incorrectly annotated sequences. Additionally, many proteins composed of several structural and/or functional domains are overlooked by automated systems. The comparative information today is huge when compared to the early days of genomics. A single error is compounded and then made complex.

The Genome Comparison Project performs a complete pairwise comparison between all predicted '''protein''' sequences, obtaining indices used (together with standardized Gene Ontology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geneontology.org The Gene Ontology website]&lt;/ref&gt;) as a reference repository for the annotator community. The project provides invaluable data sources for biologists. The sequence similarity comparison program used in the Genome Comparison Project is called SSEARCH. This program mathematically finds best local alignment between sequence pairs,&lt;ref&gt;W.R. Pearson (1991) ''Genomics'' 11:635–650&lt;/ref&gt; and is a freely available implementation of the Smith–Waterman algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;T. F. Smith and M. S. Waterman (1981) ''J. Mol. Biol'', 147:195–197&lt;/ref&gt;

SSEARCH's use makes possible a precise annotation, inconsistencies correction, and possible functions assignment to hypothetical proteins of unknown function. Moreover, proteins with multiple domains and functional elements are correctly spotted. Even distant relationships are detected.

'''Frank John Kerr''' (8 January 1918{{spaced ndash}}15 September 2000) was an [[Australia]]n [[astronomy|astronomer]] and [[physics|physicist]] who made contributions to human understanding of the [[galaxy|galactic]] structure of the [[Milky Way]].  Born in [[St Albans]] to Australian parents, Kerr returned with his family to Australia after the completion of [[World War I]].  He received degrees in physics at the [[University of Melbourne]] and an MA in astronomy from [[Harvard University]] (1951).

In 1940, Frank had joined the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) radiophysics laboratory in [[Sydney, Australia]] under the mentorship of [[Joseph Lade Pawsey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |year=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58753.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He pioneered the use of the [[magnetron]], and also studied [[superrefraction]].

In Australia in late 1951, Kerr used a specially built 36-foot transit [[telescope]], the largest dish of its kind in Australia, and started mapping the [[Magellanic Clouds]], discovering considerable amounts of [[neutral hydrogen]] and an extended envelope around both clouds.  From 1954 to 1955, Kerr was a member of the team that determined the rotation of the Magellanic Clouds and their masses.  Kerr coined the term "galactic warp" to refer to the distorting effect of the Magellanic Clouds' [[gravity]] on the shape of our own galaxy.

Over the years he worked with various astronomers, including [[Colin Gum]] and [[Gart Westerhout]].

From 1966 to 1979, he was a visiting, then full, professor of astronomy at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].

He died of [[cancer]] at [[Silver Spring, Maryland]].

'''Friction''' is the [[force]] resisting the relative motion of solid surfaces, fluid layers, and material elements sliding against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|friction}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several types of friction:
*'''Dry friction''' is a force that opposes the relative lateral motion of two solid surfaces in contact. Dry friction is subdivided into ''static friction'' ("[[stiction]]") between non-moving surfaces, and ''kinetic friction'' between moving surfaces. With the exception of atomic or molecular friction, dry friction generally arises from the interaction of surface features, known as [[Asperity (materials science)|asperities]]
*'''Fluid friction''' describes the friction between layers of a [[viscous]] fluid that are moving relative to each other.&lt;ref name="Beer"&gt;{{cite book

*'''Skin friction''' is a component of [[Drag (physics)|drag]], the force resisting the motion of a fluid across the surface of a body.
*'''Internal friction''' is the force resisting motion between the elements making up a solid material while it undergoes [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformation]].&lt;ref name="Meriam"/&gt;

When surfaces in contact move relative to each other, the friction between the two surfaces converts [[kinetic energy]] into [[thermal energy]] (that is, it converts [[Work (physics)|work]] to [[heat]]). This property can have dramatic consequences, as illustrated by the use of friction created by rubbing pieces of wood together to start a fire. Kinetic energy is converted to thermal energy whenever motion with friction occurs, for example when a [[Viscous flow|viscous]] fluid is stirred. Another important consequence of many types of friction can be [[wear]], which may lead to performance degradation or damage to components. Friction is a component of the science of [[tribology]].

Friction is desirable and important in supplying [[traction (engineering)|traction]] to facilitate motion on land. Most [[land vehicle]]s rely on friction for acceleration, deceleration and changing direction. Sudden reductions in traction can cause loss of control and accidents.
 
Friction is not itself a [[fundamental force]]. Dry friction arises from a combination of inter-surface adhesion, surface roughness, surface deformation, and surface contamination. The complexity of these interactions makes the calculation of friction from [[first principle]]s  impractical and necessitates the use of [[empirical method]]s for analysis and the development of theory.

Friction is a [[Conservative force#Nonconservative forces|non-conservative force]] - work done against friction is path dependent. In the presence of friction, some energy is always lost in the form of heat. Thus [[mechanical energy]] is not conserved.

==History==
The Greeks, including [[Aristotle]], [[Vitruvius]], and [[Pliny the Elder]], were interested in the cause and mitigation of friction.&lt;ref name=Chatterjee2008&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Chatterjee |first=Sudipta |year=2008 |title=Tribological Properties of Pseudo-elastic Nickel-titanium |publisher=University of California |via=ProQuest |isbn=9780549844372 |pages=11–12 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rX6xfoEaYtQC&amp;pg=PA12 |quote=Classical Greek philosophers like Aristotle, Pliny the Elder and Vitruvius wrote about the existence of friction, the effect of lubricants and the advantages of metal bearings around 350 B.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were aware of differences between static and kinetic friction with [[Themistius]] stating in 350 {{Smallcaps2|A.D.}} that "it is easier to further the motion of a moving body than to move a body at rest".&lt;ref name=Chatterjee2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fishbane |first1=Paul M. |last2=Gasiorowicz |first2=Stephen |last3=Thornton |first3=Stephen T. |year=1993 |title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers |edition=Extended |volume=I |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey |isbn=0-13-663246-7 |page=135 |quote=Themistius first stated around 350 {{Smallcaps2|{{sic|B.C.|expected=A.D.}}}} that kinetic friction is weaker than the maximum value of static friction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hecht |first=Eugene |date=2003 |title=Physics: Algebra/Trig |edition=3rd |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=9780534377298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sambursky |first=Samuel |date=2014 |title=The Physical World of Late Antiquity |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9781400858989 |pages=65–66 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yvz_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classic laws of sliding friction were discovered by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]  in 1493, a pioneer in [[tribology]], but the laws documented in his notebooks, were not published and remained unknown.&lt;ref name="Dowson" &gt;{{cite book |last=Dowson |first=Duncan |year=1997 |title=History of Tribology |edition=2nd |publisher=Professional Engineering Publishing |isbn=1-86058-070-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Armstrong" &gt;{{cite book |last=Armstrong-Hélouvry |first=Brian |year=1991 |title=Control of machines with friction |publisher=Springer |location=USA |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0zk_zI3xACgC&amp;pg=PA10 |isbn=0-7923-9133-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VanBeek"&gt;{{cite web |last=van Beek |first=Anton |title=History of Science Friction |publisher=tribology-abc.com |url=http://www.tribology-abc.com/abc/history.htm |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hutchings |first=Ian M.  |date=2016 |title=Leonardo da Vinci's studies of friction |doi=10.1016/j.wear.2016.04.019 |url=http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/uploads/Hutchings_Leonardo_Friction_2016_v2.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hutchings |first=Ian M. |date=2016-08-15 |title=Leonardo da Vinci's studies of friction |journal=Wear |doi=10.1016/j.wear.2016.04.019 |volume=360–361 |pages=51–66 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043164816300588}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kirk |first=Tom |date=July 22, 2016 |title=Study reveals Leonardo da Vinci's 'irrelevant' scribbles mark the spot where he first recorded the laws of friction |website=phys.org |url=http://phys.org/news/2016-07-reveals-leonardo-da-vinci-irrelevant.html |access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws were rediscovered by [[Guillaume Amontons]] in 1699&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Popova|first=Elena|last2=Popov|first2=Valentin L.|date=2015-06-01|title=The research works of Coulomb and Amontons and generalized laws of friction|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40544-015-0074-6|journal=Friction|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|pages=183–190|doi=10.1007/s40544-015-0074-6|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became known as Amonton's three laws of dry friction ''(below)''.   Amontons presented the nature of friction in terms of surface irregularities and the force required to raise the weight pressing the surfaces together. This view was further elaborated by [[Bernard Forest de Bélidor]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Forest de Bélidor|Forest de Bélidor, Bernard]]. "[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b53032692q.r=Belidor%2C%20Bernard%20Forest%20de Richtige Grund-Sätze der Friction-Berechnung]" ("Correct Basics of Friction Calculation"), 1737, (in [[German language|German]])&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leonhard Euler]] (1750), who derived the [[angle of repose]] of a weight on an inclined plane and first distinguished between static and kinetic friction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microscopic forces cause surfaces to stick together; he proposed that friction was the force necessary to tear the adhering surfaces apart.
 
The understanding of friction was further developed by [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] (1785).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Popova|first=Elena|last2=Popov|first2=Valentin L.|date=2015-06-01|title=The research works of Coulomb and Amontons and generalized laws of friction|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40544-015-0074-6|journal=Friction|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|pages=183–190|doi=10.1007/s40544-015-0074-6|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coulomb investigated the influence of four main factors on friction: the nature of the materials in contact and their surface coatings; the extent of the surface area; the normal pressure (or load); and the length of time that the surfaces remained in contact (time of repose).&lt;ref name="Dowson" /&gt; Coulomb further considered the influence of sliding velocity, temperature and humidity, in order to decide between the different explanations on the nature of friction that had been proposed. The distinction between static and dynamic friction is made in Coulomb's friction law (see below), although this distinction was already drawn by [[Johann Andreas von Segner]] in 1758.&lt;ref name="Dowson" /&gt;
The effect of the time of repose was explained by [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] (1762) by considering the surfaces of fibrous materials, with fibers meshing together, which takes a finite time in which the friction increases.

[[John Leslie (physicist)|John Leslie]] (1766–1832) noted a weakness in the views of Amontons and Coulomb: If friction arises from a weight being drawn up the inclined plane of successive [[Asperity (materials science)|asperities]], why then isn't it balanced through descending the opposite slope? Leslie was equally skeptical about the role of adhesion proposed by Desaguliers, which should on the whole have the same tendency to accelerate as to retard the motion.&lt;ref name="Dowson" /&gt; In Leslie's view, friction should be seen as a time-dependent process of flattening, pressing down asperities, which creates new obstacles in what were cavities before.

[[Arthur Jules Morin]] (1833) developed the concept of sliding versus rolling friction.  [[Osborne Reynolds]] (1866) derived the equation of viscous flow.  This completed the classic empirical model of friction (static, kinetic, and fluid) commonly used today in engineering.&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt; In 1877,  [[Fleeming Jenkin]] and [[James Alfred Ewing|J. A. Ewing]] investigated the continuity between static and kinetic friction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fleeming Jenkin]] &amp; [[James Alfred Ewing]] (1877) "[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/121556#page/322/mode/1up On Friction between Surfaces moving at Low Speeds]", ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'' Series 5, volume 4, pp 308–10; link from [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus of research during the [[20th century]] has been to understand the physical mechanisms behind friction. [[Frank Philip Bowden]] and [[David Tabor]] (1950) showed that, at a [[Microscopic scale|microscopic level]], the actual area of contact between surfaces is a very small fraction of the apparent area.&lt;ref name="VanBeek" /&gt;  This actual area of contact, caused by asperities increases with pressure. The development of the [[atomic force microscope]] (ca. 1986)  enabled scientists to study friction at the [[Atomic units|atomic scale]],&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt; showing that, on that scale, dry friction is the product of the inter-surface [[shear stress]] and the contact area. These two discoveries explain Amonton's first law ''(below)''; the macroscopic proportionality between normal force and static frictional force between dry surfaces.

==Laws of dry friction==
The elementary property of sliding (kinetic) friction were discovered by experiment in the 15th to 18th centuries and were expressed as three empirical laws:
*'''[[Guillaume Amontons#Amontons' Laws of Friction|Amontons']]  First Law''': The force of friction is directly proportional to the applied load.
*'''Amontons' Second Law''': The force of friction is independent of the apparent area of contact.
*'''Coulomb's Law of Friction''': Kinetic friction is independent of the sliding velocity.

==Dry friction&lt;!--Charles-Augustin de Coulomb links here--&gt;==
Dry friction resists relative lateral motion of two solid surfaces in contact. The two regimes of dry friction are 'static friction' ("[[stiction]]") between non-moving surfaces, and ''kinetic friction'' (sometimes called sliding friction or dynamic friction) between moving surfaces.

Coulomb friction, named after [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]], is an approximate model used to calculate the force of dry friction. It is governed by the model:

:&lt;math&gt;F_\mathrm{f} \leq \mu F_\mathrm{n},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;F_\mathrm{f}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the force of friction exerted by each surface on the other.  It is parallel to the surface, in a direction opposite to the net applied force.
*&lt;math&gt;\mu\,&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of friction, which is an empirical property of the contacting materials,
*&lt;math&gt;F_\mathrm{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[normal force]] exerted by each surface on the other, directed perpendicular (normal) to the surface.

The Coulomb friction &lt;math&gt;F_\mathrm{f}\,&lt;/math&gt; may take any value from zero up to &lt;math&gt;\mu F_\mathrm{n}\,&lt;/math&gt;, and the direction of the frictional force against a surface is opposite to the motion that surface would experience in the absence of friction. Thus, in the static case, the frictional force is exactly what it must be in order to prevent motion between the surfaces; it balances the net force tending to cause such motion. In this case, rather than providing an estimate of the actual frictional force, the Coulomb approximation provides a threshold value for this force, above which motion would commence. This maximum force is known as [[Traction (engineering)|traction]].

The force of friction is always exerted in a direction that opposes movement (for kinetic friction) or potential movement (for static friction) between the two surfaces. For example, a [[curling]] stone sliding along the ice experiences a kinetic force slowing it down. For an example of potential movement, the drive wheels of an accelerating car experience a frictional force pointing forward; if they did not, the wheels would spin, and the rubber would slide backwards along the pavement. Note that it is not the direction of movement of the vehicle they oppose, it is the direction of (potential) sliding between tire and road.

===Normal force===
[[Image:Free body diagram2.svg|right|200px|thumb|[[Free-body diagram]] for a block on a ramp. Arrows are [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] indicating directions and magnitudes of forces. ''N'' is the normal force, ''mg'' is the force of [[gravity]], and ''F&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the force of friction.]]

{{Main article|Normal force}}

The normal force is defined as the net force compressing two parallel surfaces together; and its direction is perpendicular to the surfaces. In the simple case of a mass resting on a horizontal surface, the only component of the normal force is the force due to gravity, where &lt;math&gt;N=mg\,&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the magnitude of the friction force is the product of the mass of the object, the acceleration due to gravity, and the coefficient of friction. However, the coefficient of friction is not a function of mass or volume; it depends only on the material. For instance, a large aluminum block has the same coefficient of friction as a small aluminum block. However, the magnitude of the friction force itself depends on the normal force, and hence on the mass of the block.

If an '''object is on a level surface''' and the force tending to cause it to slide is horizontal, the normal force &lt;math&gt;N\,&lt;/math&gt; between the object and the surface is just its weight, which is equal to its [[mass]] multiplied by the [[acceleration]] due to earth's gravity, ''[[standard gravity|g]]''. If the '''object is on a tilted surface''' such as an inclined plane, the normal force is less, because less of the force of gravity is perpendicular to the face of the plane. Therefore, the normal force, and ultimately the frictional force, is determined using [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] analysis, usually via a [[free body diagram]]. Depending on the situation, the calculation of the normal force may include forces other than gravity.

===Coefficient of friction===
The '''coefficient of friction''' (COF), often symbolized by the Greek letter [[Mu (letter)|µ]], is a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]] [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] value which describes the ratio of the force of friction between two bodies and the force pressing them together. The coefficient of friction depends on the materials used; for example, ice on steel has a low coefficient of friction, while rubber on pavement has a high coefficient of friction. Coefficients of friction range from near zero to greater than one.  It is an axiom of the nature of friction between metal surfaces that it is greater between two surfaces of similar metals than between two surfaces of different metals— hence, brass will have a higher coefficient of friction when moved against brass, but less if moved against steel or aluminum.&lt;ref name="Association1921"&gt;{{cite book|author=Air Brake Association|title=The Principles and Design of Foundation Brake Rigging|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DoNBAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA5|year=1921|publisher=Air brake association|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For surfaces at rest relative to each other &lt;math&gt;\mu = \mu_\mathrm{s}\,&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mu_\mathrm{s}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the ''coefficient of static friction''. This is usually larger than its kinetic counterpart. The coefficient of static friction exhibited by a pair of contacting surfaces depends upon the combined effects of material deformation characteristics and [[surface roughness]], both of which have their origins in the [[chemical bonding]] between atoms in each of the bulk materials and between the material surfaces and any [[adsorption|adsorbed material]]. The [[fractal]]ity of surfaces, a parameter describing the scaling behavior of surface asperities, is known to play an important role in determining the magnitude of the static friction.&lt;ref name="statfric"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Hanaor | first1= D. | last2=Gan |first2= Y. |last3=Einav | first3= I. | title= Static friction at fractal interfaces| journal= Tribology International | year=2016 | volume=93 | pages=229–238 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dorian_Hanaor/publication/283675011_Static_friction_at_fractal_interfaces/links/5645bda508ae9f9c13e6f162.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For surfaces in relative motion &lt;math&gt;\mu = \mu_\mathrm{k}\,&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mu_\mathrm{k}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the ''coefficient of kinetic friction''. The Coulomb friction is equal to &lt;math&gt;F_\mathrm{f}\,&lt;/math&gt;, and the frictional force on each surface is exerted in the direction opposite to its motion relative to the other surface.

[[Arthur Morin]] introduced the term and demonstrated the utility of the coefficient of friction.&lt;ref name="Dowson" /&gt; The coefficient of friction is an [[empirical]] [[measurement]] – it has to be measured [[experiment]]ally, and cannot be found through calculations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Rougher surfaces tend to have higher effective values. Both static and kinetic coefficients of friction depend on the pair of surfaces in contact; for a given pair of surfaces, the coefficient of static friction is ''usually'' larger than that of kinetic friction; in some sets the two coefficients are equal, such as teflon-on-teflon.

Most dry materials in combination have friction coefficient values between 0.3 and 0.6. Values outside this range are rarer, but [[polytetrafluoroethylene|teflon]], for example, can have a coefficient as low as 0.04. A value of zero would mean no friction at all, an elusive property. Rubber in contact with other surfaces can yield friction coefficients from 1 to 2. Occasionally it is maintained that µ is always &lt; 1, but this is not true. While in most relevant applications µ &lt; 1, a value above 1 merely implies that the force required to slide an object along the surface is greater than the normal force of the surface on the object. For example, [[silicone rubber]] or [[acrylic rubber]]-coated surfaces have a coefficient of friction that can be substantially larger than 1.

While it is often stated that the COF is a "material property," it is better categorized as a "system property." Unlike true material properties (such as conductivity, dielectric constant, yield strength), the COF for any two materials depends on system variables like [[temperature]], [[velocity]], [[atmosphere]] and also what are now popularly described as aging and deaging times; as well as on geometric properties of the interface between the materials, namely [[surface roughness|surface structure]].&lt;ref name="statfric" /&gt; For example, a [[copper]] pin sliding against a thick copper plate can have a COF that varies from 0.6 at low speeds (metal sliding against metal) to below 0.2 at high speeds when the copper surface begins to melt due to frictional heating. The latter speed, of course, does not determine the COF uniquely; if the pin diameter is increased so that the frictional heating is removed rapidly, the temperature drops, the pin remains solid and the COF rises to that of a 'low speed' test.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Under certain conditions some materials have very low friction coefficients. An example is (highly ordered pyrolytic) graphite which can have a friction coefficient below 0.01.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dienwiebel |first=Martin |title=Superlubricity of Graphite |display-authors=etal |journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |volume=92 |page=126101 |year=2004 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.126101 |url=http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl/sections/cm/ip/group/PDF/Phys.rev.lett/2004/92(2004)12601.pdf |issue=12 |bibcode=2004PhRvL..92l6101D }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This ultralow-friction regime is called [[superlubricity]].

===Static friction===&lt;!-- Traction (engineering) links here --&gt;
[[File:Static kinetic friction vs time.png|400px|right|thumb|When the mass is not moving, the object experiences static friction.  The friction increases as the applied force increases until the block moves.  After the block moves, it experiences kinetic friction, which is less than the maximum static friction.]]

Static friction is friction between two or more solid objects that are not moving relative to each other. For example, static friction can prevent an object from sliding down a sloped surface. The coefficient of static friction, typically denoted as ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, is usually higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction. Static friction is considered to arise as the result of surface roughness features across multiple length-scales at solid surfaces. These features, known as [[Asperity (materials science)|asperities]] are present down to nano-scale dimensions and result in true solid to solid contact existing only at a limited number of points accounting for only a fraction of the apparent or nominal contact area. The linearity between applied load and true contact area, arising from asperity deformation, gives rise to the linearity between static frictional force and normal force, found for typical Amonton-Coulomb type friction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Greenwood J.A. and JB Williamson| title= Contact of nominally flat surfaces | journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences | volume=295 | issue=1442 | year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The static friction force must be overcome by an applied force before an object can move. The maximum possible friction force between two surfaces before sliding begins is the product of the coefficient of static friction and the normal force: &lt;math&gt;F_{max} = \mu_\mathrm{s} F_{n}\,&lt;/math&gt;. When there is no sliding occurring, the friction force can have any value from zero up to &lt;math&gt;F_{max}\,&lt;/math&gt;. Any force smaller than &lt;math&gt;F_{max}\,&lt;/math&gt; attempting to slide one surface over the other is opposed by a frictional force of equal magnitude and opposite direction. Any force larger than &lt;math&gt;F_{max}\,&lt;/math&gt; overcomes the force of static friction and causes sliding to occur. The instant sliding occurs, static friction is no longer applicable—the friction between the two surfaces is then called kinetic friction. 
 
An example of static friction is the force that prevents a car wheel from slipping as it rolls on the ground. Even though the wheel is in motion, the patch of the tire in contact with the ground is stationary relative to the ground, so it is static rather than kinetic friction. 
 
The maximum value of static friction, when motion is impending, is sometimes referred to as '''limiting friction''',&lt;ref name="Bhavikatti"&gt;{{cite book

===Kinetic friction===
'''Kinetic friction''', also known as '''dynamic friction''' or '''sliding friction''', occurs when two objects are moving relative to each other and rub together (like a sled on the ground). The coefficient of kinetic friction is typically denoted as ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, and is usually less than the coefficient of static friction for the same materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Statics: Analysis and Design of Systems in Equilibrium|last=|first=|publisher=Wiley and Sons|year=2005|isbn=0-471-37299-4|location=|page=618|pages=|quote=In general, for given contacting surfaces, ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;|via=|author1=[[Sheri D.

The origin of kinetic friction at nanoscale can be explained by thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Makkonen |first1=L |year=2012 |title=A thermodynamic model of sliding friction |doi=10.1063/1.3699027 |journal=AIP Advances |volume=2 |issue= |page=012179 |bibcode=2012AIPA....2a2179M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon sliding, new surface forms at the back of a sliding true contact, and existing surface disappears at the front of it. Since all surfaces involve the thermodynamic surface energy, work must be spent in creating the new surface, and energy is released as heat in removing the surface. Thus, a force is required to move the back of the contact, and frictional heat is released at the front.

[[File:Free body.svg|thumb|Angle of friction, ''θ'', when block just starts to slide.]]

===Angle of friction===
{{For|the maximum angle of static friction between granular materials|Angle of repose}}
For certain applications it is more useful to define static friction in terms of the maximum angle before which one of the items will begin sliding. This is called the ''angle of friction'' or ''friction angle''. It is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\tan{\theta} = \mu_\mathrm{s}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''θ'' is the angle from horizontal and ''µ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the static coefficient of friction between the objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nichols |first=Edward Leamington |last2=Franklin |first2=William Suddards |title=The Elements of Physics |publisher=Macmillan |page=101 |year=1898 |volume=1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8IlCAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; This formula can also be used to calculate ''µ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' from empirical measurements of the friction angle.

===Friction at the atomic level===
Determining the forces required to move atoms past each other is a challenge in designing [[nanomachines]]. In 2008 scientists for the first time were able to move a single atom across a surface, and measure the forces required. Using ultrahigh vacuum and nearly zero temperature (5º K), a modified atomic force microscope was used to drag a [[cobalt]] atom, and a [[carbon monoxide]] molecule, across surfaces of copper and [[platinum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ternes |first=Markus |last2=Lutz |first2=Christopher P. |last3=Hirjibehedin |first3=Cyrus F. |last4=Giessibl |first4=Franz J. |last5=Heinrich |first5=Andreas J. |title=The Force Needed to Move an Atom on a Surface |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=319 |issue=5866 |pages=1066–1069 |date=2008-02-22 |doi=10.1126/science.1150288 |pmid=18292336 |bibcode=2008Sci...319.1066T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations of the Coulomb model===
The Coulomb approximation mathematically follows from the assumptions that surfaces are in atomically close contact only over a small fraction of their overall area, that this [[contact area]] is proportional to the normal force (until [[Saturated model|saturation]], which takes place when all area is in atomic contact), and that the frictional force is proportional to the applied normal force, independently of the contact area (you can see the experiments on friction from Leonardo da Vinci). Such reasoning aside, however, the approximation is fundamentally an empirical construct. It is a rule of thumb describing the approximate outcome of an extremely complicated physical interaction. The strength of the approximation is its simplicity and versatility. Though in general the relationship between normal force and frictional force is not exactly linear (and so the frictional force is not entirely independent of the contact area of the surfaces), the Coulomb approximation is an adequate representation of friction for the analysis of many physical systems.

When the surfaces are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes a very poor approximation (for example, [[adhesive tape]] resists sliding even when there is no normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the frictional force may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some [[drag racing]] tires are adhesive for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.

===="Negative" coefficient of friction====
{{As of|2012}}, a single study has demonstrated the potential for an ''effectively negative coefficient of friction in the low-load regime'', meaning that a decrease in normal force leads to an increase in friction. This contradicts everyday experience in which an increase in normal force leads to an increase in friction.&lt;ref name=deng2012/&gt;  This was reported in the journal ''Nature'' in October 2012 and involved the friction encountered by an atomic force microscope stylus when dragged across a graphene sheet in the presence of graphene-adsorbed oxygen.&lt;ref name=deng2012&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Deng |first1=Zhao |display-authors=etal |date=October 14, 2012 |title=Adhesion-dependent negative friction coefficient on chemically modified graphite at the nanoscale |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |bibcode=2012NatMa..11.1032D |doi=10.1038/nmat3452 |url=http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nmat3452.html |accessdate=November 18, 2012 |laysummary=http://www.rdmag.com/news/2012/10/nanoscale-graphite-can-turn-friction-upside-down |laysource=R&amp;D Magazine |laydate=October 17, 2012 |pmid=23064494 |volume=11 |pages=1032–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numerical simulation of the Coulomb model===
Despite being a simplified model of friction, the Coulomb model is useful in many [[Computer simulation|numerical simulation]] applications such as [[multibody system]]s and [[granular material]]. Even its most simple expression encapsulates the fundamental effects of sticking and sliding which are required in many applied cases, although specific algorithms have to be designed in order to efficiently [[Numerical integration|numerically integrate]] mechanical systems with Coulomb friction and bilateral or unilateral contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haslinger |first=J. |title=Approximation of the Signorini problem with friction, obeying the Coulomb law |journal=Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences |volume=5 |pages=422–437 |year=1983 |bibcode=1983MMAS....5..422H |doi=10.1002/mma.1670050127 |last2=Nedlec |first2=J.C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alart |first1=P. |last2=Curnier |first2=A. |title=A mixed formulation for frictional contact problems prone to Newton like solution method |journal=Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering |volume=92 |pages=353–375 |year=1991 |bibcode=1991CMAME..92..353A |doi=10.1016/0045-7825(91)90022-X |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Acary |first1=V. |last2=Cadoux |first2=F. |last3=Lemaréchal |first3=C. |last4=Malick |first4=J. |title=A formulation of the linear discrete Coulomb friction problem via convex optimization |journal=Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics / Zeitschrift für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=155–175 |year=2011 |doi=10.1002/zamm.201000073 |bibcode=2011ZaMM...91..155A |url=https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00495734/document }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=De Saxcé |first1=G. |last2=Feng |first2=Z.-Q. |title=The bipotential method: A constructive approach to design the complete contact law with friction and improved numerical algorithms |journal=Mathematical and Computer Modelling |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=225–245 |year=1998 |doi=10.1016/S0895-7177(98)00119-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simo |first1=J.C. |last2=Laursen |first2=T.A. |title=An augmented lagrangian treatment of contact problems involving friction |journal=Computers and Structures |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=97–116 |year=1992 |doi=10.1016/0045-7949(92)90540-G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some quite [[Nonlinear system#Types of nonlinear behaviors|nonlinear effects]], such as the so-called [[Painlevé paradox]]es, may be encountered with Coulomb friction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Acary |first=V. |last2=Brogliato |first2=B. |title=Numerical Methods for Nonsmooth Dynamical Systems. Applications in Mechanics and Electronics |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer Verlag Heidelberg]] |volume=35 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dry friction and instabilities===
Dry friction can induce several types of instabilities in mechanical systems which display a stable behaviour in the absence of friction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bigoni |first=D. |title=Nonlinear Solid Mechanics: Bifurcation Theory and Material Instability |publisher=Cambridge University Press, 2012 |isbn=9781107025417}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
These instabilities may be caused by the decrease of the friction force with an increasing velocity of sliding, by material expansion due to heat generation during friction (the thermo-elastic instabilities), or by pure dynamic effects of sliding of two elastic materials (the Adams-Martins instabilities). The latter were originally discovered in 1995 by [[George G. Adams (engineer)|George G. Adams]] and [[João Arménio Correia Martins]] for smooth surfaces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adams |first=G. G. |title=Self-excited oscillations of two elastic half-spaces sliding with a constant coefficient of friction |doi=10.1115/1.2896013 |journal=Journal of Applied Mechanics |year=1995 |volume=62 |pages=867–872 |bibcode=1995JAM....62..867A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martins |first=J.A., Faria, L.O. &amp; Guimarães, J. |title=Dynamic surface solutions in linear elasticity and viscoelasticity with frictional boundary conditions |doi=10.1115/1.2874477 |journal=Journal of Vibration and Acoustics |year=1995 |volume=117 |pages=445–451}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were later found in periodic rough surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=M |first=Nosonovsky, |last2=G. |first2=Adams G. |title=Vibration and stability of frictional sliding of two elastic bodies with a wavy contact interface |doi=10.1115/1.1653684 |journal=Journal of Applied Mechanics |year=2004 |volume=71 |pages=154–161 |bibcode=2004JAM....71..154N }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, friction-related dynamical instabilities are thought to be responsible for [[Brake#Noise|brake squeal]] and the 'song' of a [[glass harp]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=J. |first2=Hultén, |last=J. |first=Flint, |title=Lining-deformation-induced modal coupling as squeal generator in a distributed parameter disk brake model |doi=10.1006/jsvi.2001.4052 |bibcode=2002JSV...254....1F |journal=J.

A practically important case is the [[self-oscillation]] of the strings of [[bowed instruments]] such as the [[violin]], [[cello]], [[hurdy-gurdy]], [[erhu]], etc.

A connection between dry friction and [[Aeroelastic flutter#Flutter|flutter]] instability in a simple mechanical system has been discovered,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Frictional instabilities can lead to the formation of new self-organized patterns (or "secondary structures") at the sliding interface, such as in-situ formed tribofilms which are utilized for the reduction of friction and wear in so-called self-lubricating materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Fluid friction==
{{Main article|Viscosity}}

Fluid friction occurs between [[fluid]] layers that are moving relative to each other. This internal resistance to flow is named ''[[viscosity]]''. In everyday terms, the viscosity of a fluid is described as its "thickness". Thus, water is "thin", having a lower viscosity, while honey is "thick", having a higher viscosity. The less viscous the fluid, the greater its ease of deformation or movement.

All real fluids (except [[superfluid]]s) offer some resistance to shearing and therefore are viscous. For teaching and explanatory purposes it is helpful to use the concept of an inviscid fluid or an [[ideal fluid]] which offers no resistance to shearing and so is not viscous.

==Lubricated friction==
{{Main article|Lubrication}}

Lubricated friction is a case of fluid friction where a fluid separates two solid surfaces. Lubrication is a technique employed to reduce wear of one or both surfaces in close proximity moving relative to each another by interposing a substance called a lubricant between the surfaces.

In most cases the applied load is carried by pressure generated within the fluid due to the frictional viscous resistance to motion of the lubricating fluid between the surfaces. Adequate lubrication allows smooth continuous operation of equipment, with only mild wear, and without excessive stresses or seizures at bearings. When lubrication breaks down, metal or other components can rub destructively over each other, causing heat and possibly damage or failure.

==Skin friction==
{{Main article|Parasitic drag}}

Skin friction arises from the interaction between the fluid and the skin of the body, and is directly related to the area of the surface of the body that is in contact with the fluid. Skin friction follows the [[drag equation]] and rises with the square of the velocity.

Skin friction is caused by viscous drag in the [[boundary layer]] around the object. There are two ways to decrease skin friction: the first is to shape the moving body so that smooth flow is possible, like an airfoil. The second method is to decrease the length and cross-section of the moving object as much as is practicable.

==Internal friction==
{{Main article|Plastic deformation of solids}}
{{See also|Deformation (engineering)}}
Internal friction is the force resisting motion between the elements making up a solid material while it undergoes [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]].

[[Deformation (engineering)#Plastic deformation|Plastic deformation]] in solids is an irreversible change in the internal molecular structure of an object. This change may be due to either (or both) an applied force or a change in temperature. The change of an object's shape is called strain. The force causing it is called [[stress (mechanics)|stress]].

[[Elastic deformation]] in solids is reversible change in the internal molecular structure of an object. Stress does not necessarily cause permanent change. As deformation occurs, internal forces oppose the applied force. If the applied stress is not too large these opposing forces may completely resist the applied force, allowing the object to assume a new equilibrium state and to return to its original shape when the force is removed. This is known as elastic deformation or elasticity.

==Radiation friction==
As a consequence of light pressure, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Einstein, A.|title=On the development of our views concerning the nature and constitution of radiation. Translated in: The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, vol. 2 (Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1989)|date=1909|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1909 predicted the existence of "radiation friction" which would oppose the movement of matter. He wrote, “radiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The backwardacting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant 'radiation friction' in brief.”

==Other types of friction==

===Rolling resistance===
{{Main article|Rolling resistance}}

Rolling resistance is the force that resists the rolling of a wheel or other circular object along a surface caused by deformations in the object or surface. Generally the force of rolling resistance is less than that associated with kinetic friction.&lt;ref&gt;Silliman, Benjamin (1871) ''Principles of Physics, Or Natural Philosophy'', Ivison, Blakeman, Taylor &amp; company publishers&lt;/ref&gt; Typical values for the coefficient of rolling resistance are 0.001.&lt;ref&gt;Butt, Hans-Jürgen; Graf, Karlheinz and Kappl, Michael (2006) ''Physics and Chemistry of Interfaces'', Wiley, {{ISBN|3-527-40413-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the most common examples of rolling resistance is the movement of [[motor vehicle]] tires on a [[road]], a process which generates heat and [[roadway noise|sound]] as by-products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hogan |first1=C. Michael |title=Analysis of highway noise |journal=Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution |volume=2 |pages=387–392 |year=1973 |doi=10.1007/BF00159677 |issue=3|bibcode=1973WASP....2..387H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Braking friction===
Any wheel equipped with a [[brake]] is capable of generating a large retarding force, usually for the purpose of slowing and stopping a vehicle or piece of rotating machinery. Braking friction differs from rolling friction because the coefficient of friction for rolling friction is small whereas the coefficient of friction for braking friction is designed to be large by choice of materials for [[brake pad]]s.

===Triboelectric effect===
{{Main article|Triboelectric effect}}

Rubbing dissimilar materials against one another can cause a build-up of [[electrostatic charge]], which can be hazardous if flammable gases or vapours are present. When the static build-up discharges, [[explosion]]s can be caused by ignition of the flammable mixture.

===Belt friction===

{{Main article|Belt friction}}

Belt friction is a physical property observed from the forces acting on a belt wrapped around a pulley, when one end is being pulled. The resulting tension, which acts on both ends of the belt, can be modeled by the belt friction equation.

In practice, the theoretical tension acting on the belt or rope calculated by the belt friction equation can be compared to the maximum tension the belt can support. This helps a designer of such a rig to know how many times the belt or rope must be wrapped around the pulley to prevent it from slipping. Mountain climbers and sailing crews demonstrate a standard knowledge of belt friction when accomplishing basic tasks.

==Reducing friction==

===Devices===
Devices such as wheels, [[ball bearing]]s, [[roller bearing]]s, and air cushion or other types of [[fluid bearing]]s can change sliding friction into a much smaller type of rolling friction.

Many [[thermoplastic]] materials such as [[nylon]], [[HDPE]] and PTFE are commonly used in low friction [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]]. They are especially useful because the coefficient of friction falls with increasing imposed load.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} For improved wear resistance, very high [[molecular weight]] grades are usually specified for heavy duty or critical bearings.

===Lubricants===
A common way to reduce friction is by using a [[lubricant]], such as oil, water, or grease, which is placed between the two surfaces, often dramatically lessening the coefficient of friction. The science of friction and lubrication is called [[tribology]]. Lubricant technology is when lubricants are mixed with the application of science, especially to industrial or commercial objectives.

Superlubricity, a recently discovered effect, has been observed in [[graphite]]: it is the substantial decrease of friction between two sliding objects, approaching zero levels. A very small amount of frictional energy would still be dissipated.

Lubricants to overcome friction need not always be thin, turbulent fluids or powdery solids such as graphite and [[talc]]; [[acoustic lubrication]] actually uses sound as a lubricant.

Another way to reduce friction between two parts is to superimpose micro-scale vibration to one of the parts. This can be sinusoidal vibration as used in ultrasound-assisted cutting or vibration noise, known as [[dither]].

==Energy of friction==
According to the law of [[conservation of energy]], no energy is destroyed due to friction, though it may be lost to the system of concern. Energy is transformed from other forms into thermal energy. A sliding hockey puck comes to rest because friction converts its kinetic energy into heat which raises the thermal energy of the puck and the ice surface. Since heat quickly dissipates, many early philosophers, including [[Aristotle]], wrongly concluded that moving objects lose energy without a driving force.

When an object is pushed along a surface along a path C, the energy converted to heat is given by a [[line integral]], in accordance with the definition of work
   
:&lt;math&gt;E_{th} = \int_C \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{fric}(\mathbf{x}) \cdot d\mathbf{x}\ = \int_C \mu_\mathrm{k}\ \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{n}(\mathbf{x}) \cdot d\mathbf{x}, &lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_\mathrm{fric}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the friction force,
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_\mathrm{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the vector obtained by multiplying the magnitude of the normal force by a unit vector pointing ''against'' the object's motion,
: &lt;math&gt;\mu_\mathrm{k}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of kinetic friction, which is inside the integral because it may vary from location to location (e.g. if the material changes along the path),
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the position of the object.

Energy lost to a system as a result of friction is a classic example of thermodynamic [[irreversibility]].

===Work of friction===
In the reference frame of the interface between two surfaces, static friction does ''no'' [[mechanical work|work]], because there is never displacement between the surfaces. In the same reference frame, kinetic friction is always in the direction opposite the motion, and does ''negative'' work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Den Hartog |first=J. P. |title=Mechanics |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |page=142 |year=1961 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WRXrtu44W9UC |isbn=0-486-60754-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, friction can do ''positive'' work in certain [[frames of reference]]. One can see this by placing a heavy box on a rug, then pulling on the rug quickly. In this case, the box slides backwards relative to the rug, but moves forward relative to the frame of reference in which the floor is stationary. Thus, the kinetic friction between the box and rug accelerates the box in the same direction that the box moves, doing ''positive'' work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The work done by friction can translate into deformation, wear, and heat that can affect the contact surface properties (even the coefficient of friction between the surfaces). This can be beneficial as in [[polishing]]. The work of friction is used to mix and join materials such as in the process of [[friction welding]]. Excessive erosion or wear of mating sliding surfaces occurs when work due to frictional forces rise to unacceptable levels. [[hardness|Harder]] corrosion particles caught between mating surfaces in relative motion ([[fretting]]) exacerbates wear of frictional forces. Bearing seizure or failure may result from excessive wear due to work of friction. As surfaces are worn by work due to friction, [[tolerance (engineering)|fit]] and [[Surface roughness|surface finish]] of an object may degrade until it no longer functions properly.&lt;ref name="Bayer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bayer |first=Raymond George |title=Mechanical wear |publisher=CRC Press |year=2004 |pages=1, 2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q64Kq2HlyucC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=Physical+wear+is+associated+with+friction |accessdate=2008-07-07 |isbn=0-8247-4620-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Friction is an important factor in many [[engineering]] disciplines.

===Transportation===
*[[Vehicle brake|Automobile brakes]] inherently rely on friction, slowing a vehicle by converting its kinetic energy into heat. Incidentally, dispersing this large amount of heat safely is one technical challenge in designing brake systems. [[Disk brakes]] rely on friction between a disc and [[brake pads]] that are squeezed transversely against the rotating disc. In [[Drum brakes]], [[brake shoes]] or pads are pressed outwards against a rotating cylinder (brake drum) to create friction. Since braking discs can be more efficiently cooled than drums, disc brakes have better stopping performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wonderopolis.org/wonder/how-do-car-brakes-work|title=How Do Car Brakes Work?|publisher=Wonderopolis|access-date=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Rail adhesion]] refers to the grip wheels of a train have on the rails, see [[Frictional contact mechanics]].
*[[Road slipperiness]] is an important design and safety factor for automobiles&lt;ref name="HighFrictionRoad"&gt; {{cite web |author=Iskander, R and Stevens, A | url=http://saferroadsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/R-Iskander-Effectiveness-of-the-Application-of-High-Friction-Surfacing-Crash-Reduction.pdf | title=Effectiveness of the Application of High Friction Surfacing-Crash-Reduction.pdf | work= | publisher= | date= | archive-url=http://saferroadsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/R-Iskander-Effectiveness-of-the-Application-of-High-Friction-Surfacing-Crash-Reduction.pdf |archive-date=2017-09-03 |access-date=2017-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Split friction]] is a particularly dangerous condition arising due to varying friction on either side of a car.

*A [[profilograph]] is a device used to measure pavement surface roughness.

===Household usage===
*Friction is used to heat and ignite [[matchsticks]] (friction between the head of a matchstick and the rubbing surface of the match box).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://curiosity.com/topics/how-does-lighting-a-match-work-curiosity/ |title=How Does Lighting A Match Work? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=November 11, 2015 |website=curiosity.com |publisher=Curiosity |access-date=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Good Natured''''' is a book by [[primatologist]] [[Frans de Waal]] on animal behavior and the [[Evolutionary ethics|evolution of ethics]].

==Publishing history==

The book was published in 1996 by [[Harvard University Press]] under the full title '''''Good Natured: The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals'''''. Much of the book details observations of [[primate]] behavior, especially that of [[chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobo]]s.&lt;ref&gt;de Waal 1996, p. 3: "After due attention in this book's first chapter to theories of evolutionary ethics, I will move on to more practical matters. Do animals show behavior that parallels the benevolence as well as the rules and regulations of human moral conduct? … As an ethologist specialized in primatology, I naturally turn most often to the order of animals to which we ourselves belong. … Our ancestors more than likely possessed many of the behavioral tendencies currently found in macaques, baboons, gorillas, chimpanzees, and so on."&lt;/ref&gt; On the final page, he concludes:

{{quote|We seem to be reaching a point at which science can wrest morality from the hands of philosophers. That this is already happening—albeit largely at a theoretical level—is evident from recent books by, among others, [[Richard D. Alexander]], Robert Frank, [[James Q. Wilson]], and [[Robert Wright (journalist)]]. The occasional disagreements within this budding field are far outweighed by the shared belief that evolution needs to be part of any satisfactory explanation of morality. … It takes up space in our heads, it reaches out to fellow human beings, and it is as much a part of what we are as the tendencies that it holds in check.&lt;ref&gt;De Waal 1996, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. In East Asia, a state [[chronicle]], the [[Spring and Autumn Annals]] was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts survived.

Ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a [[Outline of academic disciplines#History|major discipline]] in university studies.

==Etymology==
[[File:History-Dielman-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|''History'' by [[Frederick Dielman]] (1896)]]
The word ''history'' comes ultimately from [[Ancient Greek]] [[:wikt:ἱστορία|ἱστορία]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|i(stori/a|ἱστορία}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''historía''), meaning "inquiry", "knowledge from inquiry", or "judge". It was in that sense that [[Aristotle]] used the word in his {{lang|grc|[[History of Animals|Περὶ Τὰ Ζῷα Ἱστορίαι]]}}&lt;ref name="Ferrater-Mora"&gt;Ferrater-Mora, José. ''Diccionario de Filosofia''. Barcelona: Editorial Ariel, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Perì Tà Zôa Ηistoríai'' "Inquiries about Animals"). The ancestor word {{lang|grc|ἵστωρ}} is attested early on in [[Homeric Hymns]], [[Heraclitus]], the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[ephebos|ephebes]]' oath, and in [[Boeotia|Boiotic]] inscriptions (in a legal sense, either "judge" or "witness", or similar).

The Greek word was borrowed into Classical Latin as ''historia'', meaning "investigation, inquiry, research, account, description, written account of past events, writing of history, historical narrative, recorded knowledge of past events, story, narrative". ''History'' was borrowed from Latin (possibly via [[Old Irish]] or [[Old Welsh]]) into [[Old English]] as ''stær'' ('history, narrative, story'), but this word fell out of use in the late Old English period.&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"&gt;"history, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2014. Web. 9 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, as Latin became [[Old French]] (and [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]), ''historia'' developed into forms such as ''istorie'', ''estoire'', and ''historie'', with new developments in the meaning: "account of the events of a person's life (beginning of the 12th century), chronicle, account of events as relevant to a group of people or people in general (1155), dramatic or pictorial representation of historical events (c. 1240), body of knowledge relative to human evolution, science (c. 1265), narrative of real or imaginary events, story (c. 1462)".&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"/&gt;

It was from Anglo-Norman that ''history'' was borrowed into [[Middle English]], and this time the loan stuck. It appears in the thirteenth-century ''[[Ancrene Wisse]]'', but seems to have become a common word in the late fourteenth century, with an early attestation appearing in [[John Gower]]'s ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' of the 1390s (VI.1383): "I finde in a bok compiled | To this matiere an old histoire, | The which comth nou to mi memoire". In [[Middle English]], the meaning of ''history'' was "story" in general. The restriction to the meaning "the branch of knowledge that deals with past events; the formal record or study of past events, esp. human affairs" arose in the mid-fifteenth century.&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"/&gt;

With the [[Renaissance]], older senses of the word were revived, and it was in the Greek sense that [[Francis Bacon]] used the term in the late sixteenth century, when he wrote about "[[Natural history|Natural History]]". For him, ''historia'' was "the knowledge of objects determined by space and time", that sort of knowledge provided by [[memory]] (while [[science]] was provided by [[reason]], and [[poetry]] was provided by [[fantasy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "history, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2014. Web. 9 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an expression of the linguistic [[Synthetic language|synthetic vs. analytic/isolating dichotomy]], English like Chinese (史 vs. 诌) now designates separate words for human history and [[storytelling]] in general. In modern German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both "history" and "story".

The adjective ''historical'' is attested from 1661, and ''historic'' from 1669.&lt;ref name="Whitney"&gt;Whitney, W. D. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]''. New York: The Century Co, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Historian'' in the sense of a "researcher of history" is attested from 1531. In all [[Languages of Europe|European languages]], the substantive "history" is still used to mean both "what happened with men", and "the scholarly study of the happened", the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, "History", or the word ''[[historiography]]''.&lt;ref name="Ferrater-Mora" /&gt;

==Description==
[[File:The Historians' History of the World - Title Page.jpg|thumb|The title page to ''[[The Historians' History of the World]]'']]
Historians write in the context of their own time, and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society. In the words of [[Benedetto Croce]], "All history is contemporary history". History is facilitated by the formation of a "true discourse of past" through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race.&lt;ref&gt;W. D. Whitney, (1889). [https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]. Page [https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA2842,M1 2842].&lt;/ref&gt; The modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.

All events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record.&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn WordNet Search – 3.0] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050917065532/http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn |date=17 September 2005 }}, "History".&lt;/ref&gt; The task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past. Therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the "true past").

The study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the [[humanities]] and at other times as part of the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Gordon and James Gordon Irving, ''The History and Philosophy of Social Science''. Routledge 1991. Page 1. {{ISBN|0-415-05682-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from both. Some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, H. (1986). Dictionary of concepts in history. Reference sources for the social sciences and humanities, no. 3. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press. Page 416.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, French [[historian]] [[Fernand Braudel]] revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as [[economics]], [[anthropology]], and [[geography]] in the study of global history.

Traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an [[oral tradition]], and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts. From the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures. In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Lemon (1995). The Discipline of History and the History of Thought. Routledge. Page 201. {{ISBN|0-415-12346-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; But writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.

[[Archaeology]] is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects, which, once unearthed, contribute to the study of history. But archaeology rarely stands alone. It uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries. However, archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history; that is to say, archaeology does not "fill the gaps" within textual sources. Indeed, "historical archaeology" is a specific branch of archaeology, often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources. For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical [[Annapolis, Maryland]], USA; has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment, despite the ideology of "liberty" inherent in written documents at this time.

There are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, [[culture|culturally]], territorially, and thematically. These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant overlaps are often present, as in "The International Women's Movement in an Age of Transition, 1830–1975." It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization. The area called [[Big History]] resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. History has often been studied with some practical or [[theory|theoretical]] aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.&lt;ref name="graham-ch1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shape of the Past |author=Graham, Gordon |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |year=1997 |chapter=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and prehistory==
{{Human history and prehistory|250}}
{{Further|Protohistory}}

The [[history of the world]] is the memory of the past [[experience]] of ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' around the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely in written records. By "prehistory", historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. By studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record. Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] America. Historians in the West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC&amp;pg=RA2-PA1930&amp;dq=Jack+Goody+2007&amp;sig=g0N7ZF9nz_Uy8nrQTiGdsc0N3sI#PPA12,M1 The Theft of History]'' (from [[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, British historian [[E. H. Carr]] wrote:
{{quote|The line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease to live only in the present, and become consciously interested both in their past and in their future. History begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future. Records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Edward H. (1961). ''What is History?'', p.108, {{ISBN|0-14-020652-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as [[Indigenous Australians]] and New Zealand [[Māori people|Māori]] in the past, and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with European civilization.

==Historiography==
{{Main|Historiography}}
[[File:Guicciardini M Francesco La Historia dItalia.jpg|thumb|left|The title page to ''La Historia d'Italia'']]
Historiography has a number of related meanings. Firstly, it can refer to how history has been produced: the story of the development of [[Historical method|methodology]] and practices (for example, the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis). Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical writing (for example, "medieval historiography during the 1960s" means "Works of medieval history written during the 1960s"). Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the [[Philosophy of history]]. As a [[meta-level]] analysis of descriptions of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives, interpretations, [[world view]], use of evidence, or method of presentation of other historians. Professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach, ''Historiography: Ancient, medieval, and modern'' (University of Chicago Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg G. Iggers, ''Historiography in the twentieth century: From scientific objectivity to the postmodern challenge'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Philosophy of history}}
{{unreferenced section| date= January 2016}}
Philosophy of history is a branch of philosophy concerning the eventual significance, if any, of human history. Furthermore, it speculates as to a possible teleological end to its development—that is, it asks if there is a design, purpose, directive principle, or finality in the processes of human history. Philosophy of history should not be confused with historiography, which is the study of history as an academic discipline, and thus concerns its methods and practices, and its development as a discipline over time. Nor should philosophy of history be confused with the [[history of philosophy]], which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas through time.

&lt;div style="background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;"&gt; Historical method basics &lt;/div&gt;

The following questions are used by historians in modern work.
# ''When was'' the source, written or unwritten, produced ([[Calendar date|date]])?
# Where was it produced ([[Internationalization and localization|localization]])?
# By whom was it produced ([[author]]ship)?
# From what pre-existing material was it produced ([[wikt:analysis|analysis]])?
# In what original form was it produced ([[integrity]])?
# What is the evidential value of its contents ([[credibility]])?
The first four are known as [[historical criticism]]; the fifth, [[textual criticism]]; and, together, external criticism. ''The sixth and final inquiry'' about a source is called internal criticism.

The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which [[historian]]s use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]].

[[Herodotus]] of [[Halicarnassus]] (484 BC – ca.425 BC)&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author1=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C.  |author2=Jeremy A. Sabloff |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |year=1979 |page=5|isbn=978-0-88133-834-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; has generally been acclaimed as the "father of history". However, his contemporary [[Thucydides]] (c. 460 BC – ca. 400 BC) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at [[Causality|cause and effect]], rather than as the result of divine intervention.&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"/&gt; In his historical method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, a neutral point of view, and that the human world was the result of the actions of human beings. Greek historians also viewed history as [[Historic recurrence|cyclical]], with events regularly recurring.&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author1=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C.  |author2=Jeremy A. Sabloff |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |year=1979 |page=6|isbn=978-0-88133-834-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval [[China]]. The groundwork for professional historiography in [[East Asia]] was established by the [[Han dynasty]] court historian known as [[Sima Qian]] (145–90 BC), author of the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (''Shiji''). For the quality of his written work, Sima Qian is posthumously known as the Father of [[Chinese historiography]]. Chinese historians of subsequent dynastic periods in China used his ''Shiji'' as the official format for [[Twenty-Four Histories|historical texts]], as well as for biographical literature.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was influential in [[Western Christianity|Christian]] and [[Western thought]] at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and [[Renaissance]] periods, history was often studied through a [[sacred history|sacred]] or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] brought [[philosophy]] and a more [[Secularity|secular]] approach in historical study.&lt;ref name="graham-ch1"/&gt;

In the preface to his book, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), the [[Historiography of early Islam|Arab historian]] and [[Sociology in medieval Islam|early sociologist]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past. Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data." As a result, he introduced a [[scientific method]] to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his "new science".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], Franz Rosenthal, N. J. Dawood (1967), ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'', p. x, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|0-691-01754-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of [[State (polity)|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]] and [[systemic bias|systematic bias]] in history,&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H.

In the West, historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany. The 19th-century historian with greatest influence on methods was [[Leopold von Ranke]] in Germany.

In the 20th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or [[Great Man theory|great men]], to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a [[social science]] rather than as an [[art]], which traditionally had been the case. Some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included [[Fernand Braudel]], [[E. H. Carr]], [[Fritz Fischer]], [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], [[Bruce Trigger]], [[Marc Bloch]], [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Peter Gay]], [[Robert Fogel]], [[Lucien Febvre]] and [[Lawrence Stone]]. Many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach. Braudel combined history with geography, Bracher history with political science, Fogel history with economics, Gay history with psychology, Trigger history with archaeology while Wehler, Bloch, Fischer, Stone, Febvre and Le Roy Ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics. More recently, the field of [[digital history]] has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.

In opposition to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], [[John Lukacs]], [[Donald Creighton]], [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] and [[Gerhard Ritter]] argued that the key to the historians' work was the power of the [[imagination]], and hence contended that history should be understood as an art. French historians associated with the [[Annales School]] introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of [[cultural history]] (cf. ''[[History of mentalities|histoire des mentalités]]''). Intellectual historians such as [[Herbert Butterfield]], [[Ernst Nolte]] and [[George Mosse]] have argued for the significance of ideas in history. American historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked ethnic, racial, and socio-economic groups. Another genre of [[social history]] to emerge in the post-WWII era was ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' (History of Everyday Life). Scholars such as [[Martin Broszat]], [[Ian Kershaw]] and [[Detlev Peukert]] sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century Germany, especially in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] period.

[[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]] such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Rodney Hilton]], [[Georges Lefebvre]], [[Eugene Genovese]], [[Isaac Deutscher]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Timothy Mason]], [[Herbert Aptheker]], [[Arno J. Mayer]] and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] have sought to validate [[Karl Marx]]'s theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to the Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as [[François Furet]], [[Richard Pipes]], [[J. C. D. Clark]], [[Roland Mousnier]], [[Henry Ashby Turner]] and [[Robert Conquest]] have offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history. [[Feminism|Feminist]] historians such as [[Joan Wallach Scott]], [[Claudia Koonz]], [[Natalie Zemon Davis]], [[Sheila Rowbotham]], [[Gisela Bock]], [[Gerda Lerner]], [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]], and [[Lynn Hunt]] have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past. In recent years, [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. In his 1997 book ''In Defence of History'', [[Richard J. Evans]] defended the worth of history. Another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the Australian historian [[Keith Windschuttle]]'s 1994 book, ''The Killing of History''.

==Marxian theory of history==
{{Main|Marx's theory of history}}
The [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theory]] of [[historical materialism]] theorises that society is fundamentally determined by the ''material conditions'' at any given time&amp;nbsp;– in other words, the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfill basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See, in particular, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself" (Marx, Karl: Letter to editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'', 1877). His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxist historiography]] was once orthodoxy in the Soviet Union, but since the collapse of communism there in 1991, Mikhail Krom says it has been reduced to the margins of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail M. Krom, "From the Center to the Margin: the Fate of Marxism in Contemporary Russian Historiography," ''Storia della Storiografia'' (2012) Issue 62, pp 121-130&lt;/ref&gt;

===Periods===
{{Main|Periodization}}
Historical study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of time. Historians give these [[Periodization|periods of time]] names in order to allow "organising ideas and classificatory generalisations" to be used by historians.&lt;ref name="Marwick-p169"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nature of History |author=Marwick, Arthur|publisher=The Macmillan Press LTD |year=1970 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the beginning and end of a particular period. [[Century|Centuries]] and [[decade]]s are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the [[Calendar era|dating system]] used. Most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past. The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied.&lt;ref name="Tosh-p168-169"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pursuit of History|author=Tosh, John|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|year=2006 |pages=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prehistoric periodisation====
The field of history generally leaves prehistory to the archaeologists, who have entirely different sets of tools and theories. The usual method for periodisation of the distant [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] past, in [[archaeology]] is to rely on changes in material culture and technology, such as the [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] and their sub-divisions also based on different styles of material remains. Here prehistory is divided into a series of "chapters" so that periods in history could unfold not only in a relative chronology but also narrative chronology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Archaeology of Time|last=Lucas|first=Gavin|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=0415311977|location=Oxon|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This narrative content could be in the form of functional-economic interpretation. There are periodisation, however, that do not have this narrative aspect, relying largely on relative chronology and, thus, devoid of any specific meaning.

Despite the development over recent decades of the ability through [[radiocarbon dating]] and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts, these long-established schemes seem likely to remain in use. In many cases neighbouring cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it, which may be used. Periodisation, however, is not viewed as a perfect framework with one account explaining that "cultural changes do not conveniently start and stop (combinedly) at periodisation boundaries" and that different trajectories of change are also needed to be studied in their own right before they get intertwined with cultural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Living Landscape: Bronze Age Settlement Sites in the Dutch River Area (C. 2000-800 BC)|last=Arnoldussen|first=Stijn|publisher=Sidestone Press|year=2007|isbn=9789088900105|location=Leiden|pages=468}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Geographical locations===
Particular [[Geography|geographical]] locations can form the basis of historical study, for example, [[continent]]s, [[Country|countries]], and [[City|cities]]. Understanding why historic events took place is important. To do this, historians often turn to [[geography]]. According to [[Jules Michelet]] in his book ''Histoire de France'' (1833), "without geographical basis, the people, the makers of history, seem to be walking on air."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Relations of History and Geography: Studies in England, France and the United States|last=Darby|first=Henry Clifford|publisher=University of Exeter Press|year=2002|isbn=0859896994|location=Exeter|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there. For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the [[geography of Egypt]] is essential. Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks. The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities. That meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization. There is also the case of climate, which historians like [[Ellsworth Huntington]] and Allen Semple, cited as a crucial influence on the course of history and racial temperament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World history from early times to A D 2000|last=Rao|first=B.V.|publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt.

====Regions====
* [[History of Africa]] begins with the first emergence of modern human beings on the continent, continuing into its modern present as a patchwork of diverse and politically developing nation states.
* [[History of the Americas]] is the collective history of North and South America, including Central America and the Caribbean.
** [[History of North America]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's northern and western hemisphere.
** [[History of Central America]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's western hemisphere.
** [[History of the Caribbean]] begins with the oldest evidence where 7,000-year-old remains have been found.
** [[History of South America]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's southern and western hemisphere.
* [[History of Antarctica]] emerges from early Western theories of a vast continent, known as Terra Australis, believed to exist in the far south of the globe.
* [[History of Australia]] starts with the documentation of the Makassar trading with Indigenous Australians on Australia's north coast.
* [[History of New Zealand]] dates back at least 700 years to when it was discovered and settled by Polynesians, who developed a distinct Māori culture centred on kinship links and land.
* [[History of the Pacific Islands]] covers the history of the islands in the Pacific Ocean.
* [[History of Eurasia]] is the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions: the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Europe, linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe of Central Asia and Eastern Europe.
** [[History of Europe]] describes the passage of time from humans inhabiting the European continent to the present day.
** [[History of Asia]] can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions, East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe.
*** [[History of East Asia]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation in East Asia.
*** [[History of the Middle East]] begins with the earliest civilizations in the region now known as the Middle East that were established around 3000 BC, in Mesopotamia (Iraq).
*** [[History of India]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation in the Sub-Himalayan region.
*** [[History of Southeast Asia]] has been characterized as interaction between regional players and foreign powers.

===Military history===
{{Main|Military history}}

[[Military history]] concerns warfare, strategies, battles, weapons, and the psychology of combat. The "new military history" since the 1970s has been concerned with soldiers more than generals, with psychology more than tactics, and with the broader impact of warfare on society and culture.&lt;ref name=Pavkovic&gt;{{Cite book | last =Pavkovic

===History of religion===
{{Main|History of religions}}

The history of religion has been a main theme for both secular and religious historians for centuries, and continues to be taught in seminaries and academe. Leading journals include ''[[Church History (journal)|Church History]]'', ''[[The Catholic Historical Review]]'', and ''[[History of Religions (journal)|History of Religions]]''. Topics range widely from political and cultural and artistic dimensions, to theology and liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eric |last=Cochrane |title=What Is Catholic Historiography? |journal=Catholic Historical Review |volume=61 |issue=2 |year=1975 |pages=169–190 |jstor=25019673 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This subject studies religions from all regions and areas of the world where humans have lived.&lt;ref&gt;For example see {{cite journal |first=Sofia Boesch |last=Gajano |first2=Tommaso |last2=Caliò |title=Italian Religious Historiography in the 1990s |journal=Journal of Modern Italian Studies |year=1998 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=293–306 |jstor= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social history===
{{Main|Social history}}
''Social history'', sometimes called the ''new social history'', is the field that includes history of ordinary people and their strategies and institutions for coping with life.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stearns, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Social History'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; In its "golden age" it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments. In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%. Based on full-time professors in U.S. history departments. Stephen H. Haber, David M. Kennedy, and Stephen D. Krasner, "Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations," ''International Security'', Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1997), pp. 34-43 at p. 4 2; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539326 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In the history departments of British universities in 2007, of the 5723 faculty members, 1644 (29%)  identified themselves with social history while [[political history]] came next with 1425 (25%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html Teachers of History in the Universities of the UK 2007 - listed by research interest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530073940/http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html |date=30 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The "old" social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were "social" in the sense of being outside the elite system. Social history was contrasted with [[political history]], [[intellectual history]] and the history of [[Great Man theory|great men]]. English historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, "Without social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=English Social History: A Survey of Six Centuries from Chaucer to Queen Victoria|author=[[G. M. Trevelyan]]|publisher=Book Club Associates|year=1973|chapter=Introduction|page=i|isbn=978-0-582-48488-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as "history with the people put back in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The People's State: East German Society from Hitler to Honecker|author=Mary Fulbrook|location=London|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=2005|chapter=Introduction: The people's paradox|page=17|isbn=978-0-300-14424-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Demographic history]]
* [[History of education]]
* [[Ethnic history]]
* [[History of the family]]
* [[Labor history (discipline)|Labour history]]
* [[Rural history]]
* [[Urban history]]
** [[American urban history]]
* [[Women's history]]
Smaller specialties include:
* [[History of childhood]]
* [[Gender history]]

===Cultural history===
{{Main|Cultural history}}
Cultural history replaced [[social history]] as the dominant form in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people. How peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic.
Cultural history includes the study of [[History of art|art in society]] as well is the study of images and human visual production ([[iconography]]).&lt;ref&gt;The first World Dictionary of Images: Laurent Gervereau (ed.), "Dictionnaire mondial des images", Paris, Nouveau monde, 2006, 1120p, {{ISBN|978-2-84736-185-8}}.

===Diplomatic history===
{{Main|Diplomatic history}}
[[Diplomatic history]]  focuses on the relationships between nations, primarily regarding diplomacy and the causes of wars. More recently it looks at the causes of peace and human rights. It typically presents the viewpoints of the foreign office, and long-term strategic values, as the driving force of continuity and change in history. This type of ''political history'' is the study of the conduct of [[International relations#History|international relations]] between states or across state boundaries over time. Historian Muriel Chamberlain notes that after the First World War, "diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation, at once the most important, most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies."&lt;ref&gt;Muriel E Chamberlain, ''Pax Britannica'? British Foreign Policy 1789–1914'' (1988) p 1&lt;/ref&gt; She adds that after 1945, the trend reversed, allowing social history to replace it.

===Economic history===
{{main|Economic history|Business history}}
Although economic history has been well established since the late 19th century, in recent years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and away from traditional history departments.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Whaples, "Is Economic History a Neglected Field of Study?," Historically Speaking (April 2010) v. 11#2 pp 17-20, with responses pp 20-27&lt;/ref&gt; [[Business history]]  deals with the history of individual business organizations, business methods, government regulation, labour relations, and impact on society. It also includes biographies of individual companies, executives, and entrepreneurs. It is related to economic history; Business history is most often taught in business schools.&lt;ref&gt;Franco Amatori, and Geoffrey Jones, eds. ''Business History Around the World'' (2003) [https://www.questia.com/read/114846992 online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental history===
{{main|Environmental history}}
Environmental history is a new field that emerged in the 1980s to look at the history of the environment, especially in the long run, and the impact of human activities upon it.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Hughes, ''What is Environmental History'' (2006) [https://www.amazon.com/What-Environmental-History/dp/0745631886/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===World history===
{{main|World history}}
{{See also|History of the world|Universal history}}
World history is the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. World history is primarily a teaching field, rather than a research field. It gained popularity in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ainslie Embree]] and Carol Gluck, eds., ''Asia in Western and World History: A Guide for Teaching''  (M.E. Sharpe, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Japan&lt;ref&gt;Shigeru Akita, "World History and the Emergence of Global History in Japan,"''Chinese Studies in History'', Spring 2010, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 84-96&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds.

It has led to highly controversial interpretations by [[Oswald Spengler]] and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], among others.

The World History Association publishes the ''Journal of World History'' every quarter since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/jwhindex.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501050602/http://www.historycooperative.org/jwhindex.html |archivedate=1 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The H-World discussion list&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/~world/|title=H-World - H-Net|website=www.h-net.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews.

===People's history===
{{Main|People's history}}
A [[people's history]] is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events from the [[Populism|perspective of common people]]. A people's history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders. Individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary focus, which includes the [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], the [[oppression|oppressed]], the [[poverty|poor]], the [[nonconformist]]s, and the otherwise forgotten people. The authors are typically on the left and have a socialist model in mind, as in the approach of the [[History Workshop Journal|History Workshop]] movement in Britain in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wade Matthews|title=The New Left, National Identity, and the Break-up of Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfmZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20|year=2013|publisher=BRILL|pages=20–21|isbn=9789004253070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual history===
{{Main|Intellectual history|History of ideas}}
Intellectual history and the history of ideas emerged in the mid-20th century, with the focus on the intellectuals and their books on the one hand, and on the other the study of ideas as disembodied objects with a career of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anthony |last=Grafton |title=The History of Ideas: Precept and Practice, 1950–2000 and beyond |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=67 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=1–32 |url=http://sydney.edu.au/intellectual-history/documents/grafton-history-ideas.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Maryanne Cline |editor-last=Horowitz |title=New Dictionary of the History of Ideas |volume=6 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender history===
{{Main|Gender history}}
[[Gender history]] is a sub-field of History and [[Gender studies]], which looks at the past from the perspective of [[gender]]. It is in many ways, an outgrowth of [[women's history]]. Despite its relatively short life, Gender History (and its forerunner Women's History) has had a rather significant effect on the general study of history. Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases, each with its own challenges and outcomes. Although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession, other influences are more subtle.

===Public history===
{{Main|Public history}}
[[Public history]] describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields. The term itself began to be used in the U.S. and Canada in the late 1970s, and the field has become increasingly professionalized since that time. Some of the most common settings for public history are museums, historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television companies, and all levels of government.&lt;ref&gt;David Glassberg, "Public history and the study of memory." ''The Public Historian'' (1996): 7-23. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3377910 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional and amateur historians discover, collect, organize, and present information about past events.They discover this information through archaeological evidence, written primary sources from the past and other various means such as place names. In [[list of historians|lists of historians]], historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which they were writing, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialized. [[Chronicle]]rs and [[annals|annalists]], though they are not historians in the true sense, are also frequently included.

Since the 20th century, Western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide the "judgement of history."&lt;ref name="Curran2000p413"&gt;Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) ''Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law'' in F. C. DeCoste, Bernard Schwartz (eds.) ''Holocaust's Ghost: Writings on Art, Politics, Law and Education'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=lLnBSq7YP0gC&amp;pg=PA413&amp;lpg=PA413 pp.413-5]&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of historical judgements or interpretations are separate to those of [[Judgment (law)|legal judgement]]s, that need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final.&lt;ref name="Curran2000p415"&gt;Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) ''Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law'' in F. C. DeCoste, Bernard Schwartz (eds.) ''Holocaust's Ghost: Writings on Art, Politics, Law and Education'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=lLnBSq7YP0gC&amp;pg=PA415&amp;lpg=PA415 p.415]&lt;/ref&gt; A related issue to that of the judgement of history is that of [[collective memory]].

==Pseudohistory==
{{Main|Pseudohistory}}

[[Pseudohistory]] is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart from standard [[Historical method|historiographical conventions]] in a way which undermines their conclusions.
Closely related to deceptive [[Historical negationism|historical revisionism]], works which draw controversial conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, particularly in the fields of national, political, military, and religious affairs, are often rejected as pseudohistory.

==Teaching history==

===Scholarship vs teaching===
A major intellectual battle took place in Britain in the early twentieth century regarding the place of history teaching in the universities. At Oxford and Cambridge, scholarship was downplayed. Professor [[Charles Harding Firth]], Oxford's Regius Professor of history in 1904 ridiculed the system as best suited to produce superficial journalists. The Oxford tutors, who had more votes than the professors, fought back in defence of their system saying that it successfully produced Britain's outstanding statesmen, administrators, prelates, and diplomats, and that mission was as valuable as training scholars. The tutors dominated the debate until after the Second World War. It forced aspiring young scholars to teach at outlying schools, such as Manchester University, where [[Thomas Frederick Tout]] was professionalizing the History undergraduate programme by introducing the study of original sources and requiring the writing of a thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Roots, "Firth, Sir Charles Harding (1857–1936)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33137, Online; accessed 10 Nov 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reba Soffer, "Nation, duty, character and confidence: history at Oxford, 1850–1914." ''Historical Journal'' (1987) 30#01 pp: 77-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, scholarship was concentrated at the major PhD-producing universities, while the large number of other colleges and universities focused on undergraduate teaching. A tendency in the 21st century was for the latter schools to increasingly demand scholarly productivity of their younger tenure-track faculty. Furthermore, universities have increasingly relied on inexpensive part-time adjuncts to do most of the classroom teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Donoghue, ''The Last Professors: The Corporate University and the Fate of the Humanities'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalism===
From the origins of national school systems in the 19th century, the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority. In the United States after World War I, a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in Western Civilization, so as to give students a common heritage with Europe. In the U.S. after 1980, attention increasingly moved toward teaching [[world history]] or requiring students to take courses in non-western cultures, to prepare students for life in a globalized economy.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Swansinger, "Preparing Student Teachers for a World History Curriculum in New York," ''History Teacher'', (November 2009), 43#1 pp 87-96&lt;/ref&gt;

At the university level, historians debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the humanities. Many view the field from both perspectives.

The teaching of history in French schools was influenced by the ''[[Nouvelle histoire]]'' as disseminated after the 1960s by ''Cahiers pédagogiques and Enseignement'' and other journals for teachers. Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique, (INRDP). Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils children should learn about historians' approaches as well as facts and dates. Louis François, Dean of the History/Geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote "active methods" which would give pupils "the immense happiness of discovery." Proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored. Traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Abby Waldman, " The Politics of History Teaching in England and France during the 1980s," ''History Workshop Journal''  Issue 68, Autumn 2009 pp. 199-221  [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v068/68.waldman.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bias in school teaching===
[[File:Historybooks.JPG|thumb|History books in a bookstore]]
In several countries history textbooks are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism, and give students the official line about national enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Nicholls, ed. ''School History Textbooks across Cultures: International Debates and Perspectives'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favourable light. For example, in Japan, mention of the [[Nanking Massacre]] has been removed from textbooks and the entire Second World War is given cursory treatment. Other countries have complained.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Schneider, "The Japanese History Textbook Controversy in East Asian Perspective," ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', May 2008, Vol. 617, pp 107-122&lt;/ref&gt; It was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid Marxist historiography.&lt;ref&gt;"Problems of Teaching Contemporary Russian History," ''Russian Studies in History'', Winter 2004, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 61-62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Blackwell-Synergy.com |journal=International Affairs |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=365–370 |doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2346.2008.00708.x|year = 2008|last1 = Wedgwood Benn|first1 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], especially the [[Southern United States|southern part]] history about [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the [[American Civil War]] are controversial topics. [[McGraw-Hill Education]] for example, was criticised for describing Africans brought to American plantations as "workers" instead of slaves in a textbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fernandez|first1=Manny|last2=Hauser|first2=Christine|date=5 October 2015|title=Texas Mother Teaches Textbook Company a Lesson on Accuracy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/us/publisher-promises-revisions-after-textbook-refers-to-african-slaves-as-workers.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes with success.&lt;ref&gt;"Teaching History in Schools: the Politics of Textbooks in India," ''History Workshop Journal'', April 2009, Issue 67, pp 99-110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tatyana Volodina, "Teaching History in Russia After the Collapse of the USSR," ''History Teacher'', February 2005, Vol. 38 Issue 2, pp 179-188&lt;/ref&gt;

In 21st-century Germany, the history curriculum is controlled by the 16 states, and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an "almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone" and reflects "principles formulated by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, thus oriented towards human rights, democracy and peace."  The result is that "German textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centered on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness."&lt;ref&gt;Simone Lässig and Karl Heinrich Pohl, "History Textbooks and Historical Scholarship in Germany," ''History Workshop Journal'' Issue 67, Spring 2009 pp 128-9 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v067/67.lassig.html online at project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Human Genome Diversity Project''' ('''HGDP''') was started by [[Stanford University]]'s Morrison Institute and a collaboration of scientists around the world. It is the result of many years of work by [[Cavalli-Sforza|Luigi Cavalli-Sforza]], one of the most cited scientists in the world, who has published extensively in the use of genetics to understand human migration and evolution. The HGDP data sets have often been cited in papers on such topics as [[population genetics]], [[anthropology]], and heritable [[disease]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11954565 |year=2002 |last1=Cann |first1=HM |last2=De Toma |first2=C |last3=Cazes |first3=L |last4=Legrand |first4=MF |last5=Morel |first5=V |last6=Piouffre |first6=L |last7=Bodmer |first7=J |last8=Bodmer |first8=WF |last9=Bonne-Tamir |first9=B |last10=Cambon-Thomsen |first10=A |last11=Chen |first11=Z |last12=Chu |first12=J |last13=Carcassi |first13=C |last14=Contu |first14=L |last15=Du |first15=R |last16=Excoffier |first16=L |last17=Ferrara |first17=G.

The project has noted the need to record the genetic profiles of indigenous populations, as isolated populations are the best way to understand the genetic frequencies that have clues into our distant past. Knowing about the relationship between such populations makes it possible to infer the journey of humankind from the humans who left Africa and populated the world to the humans of today. The HGDP-CEPH Human Genome Diversity Cell Line Panel is a resource of 1,063 cultured lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 1,050 individuals in 52 world populations, banked at the [[Fondation Jean Dausset-CEPH]] in Paris.

The HGDP is not related to the [[Human Genome Project|Human Genome Project (HGP)]] and has attempted to maintain a distinct identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.verslo.is/home/Raungreinar/lif/Itarefni/Liftaekni/Human%20genome%20diversity%20project(e).htm#Q3|title=HGDP FAQ|website=www.verslo.is|access-date=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studied populations==
The HGDP includes the 51 populations from around the world.&lt;ref name="pmid18292342"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Li JZ, Absher DM, Tang H, Southwick AM, Casto AM, Ramachandran S et al.| title=Worldwide human relationships inferred from genome-wide patterns of variation. | journal=Science | year= 2008 | volume= 319 | issue= 5866 | pages= 1100-4 | pmid=18292342 | doi=10.1126/science.1153717 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=18292342  }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Informed consent==

One of the most important tenets of the HGDP debate has been the social and ethical implications for indigenous populations, specifically the methods and ethics of informed consent. Some questions include: How would consent be obtained? Would individuals or groups fully understand the project's intentions, particularly with regards to language barriers and differing cultural views? What is 'informed' in a cross-cultural context? Who would be authorized to actually give consent? How would individuals know what happened to their DNA? For how long would their information be kept in DNA databases?  These questions are specifically addressed by the HGDP's "Model Ethical Protocol for Collecting DNA Samples".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12627556 |year=1997 |last1=Weiss |first1=KM |last2=Cavalli-Sforza |first2=LL |last3=Dunston |first3=GM |last4=Feldman |first4=M |last5=Greely |first5=HT |last6=Kidd |first6=KK |last7=King |first7=M |last8=Moore |first8=JA |last9=Szathmary |first9=E |last10=Twinn |first10=C. M. |title=Proposed model ethical protocol for collecting DNA samples |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=1431–74 |journal=Houston law review|display-authors=8 |author11=North American Regional Committee of the Human Genome Diversity Project }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential benefits==

The scientific community has used the HGDP data to study human migration, mutation rates, relationships between different populations, genes involved in height, and selective pressure. HGDP has been instrumental in assessing human diversity and in providing information about similarities and differences in human populations. The HGDP is the project with the largest scope among the various human diversity databases available.

So far 148 papers have been published using the HGDP database. Authors using HGDP data work in the US, Russia, Brasil, Ireland, Portugal, France, and other countries.

More specifically, HGDP data has been used in studies of evolution and expansion of modern human populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1171–86 |doi=10.1086/375120 |title=Features of Evolution and Expansion of Modern Humans, Inferred from Genomewide Microsatellite Markers |year=2003 |last1=Zhivotovsky |first1=Lev A. |last2=Rosenberg |first2=Noah A. |last3=Feldman |first3=Marcus W. |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=72 |issue=5 |pmid=12690579 |pmc=1180270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diversity research is relevant in various fields of study ranging from [[Clinical surveillance|disease surveillance]] to [[anthropology]]. Genomewide-association studies (GWAS) try to associate a genetic mutation with a disease; it is becoming clear that these associations are population-dependent and that understanding human diversity will be a major step toward increasing the power to find genes associated with disease.

To gain a full assessment of [[Human development (biology)|human development]], scientists must engage in diversity research. This research needs to be conducted as quickly as possible before small native populations such as those in [[South America]] become extinct.

Another benefit of genomic diversity mapping would be in [[Medical research|disease research]]. Diversity research could help explain why certain [[ethnic]] populations are vulnerable to or resistant to certain diseases and how populations have adapted to vulnerabilities (see [[race in biomedicine]]).

The study of human populations has been at the forefront of genomic and clinical research since the [[Human Genome Project|Human Genome Project (HGP)]] was completed. Projects similar to HGDP are the 1000 Genomes Project and the HapMap Project. Each has its own specificities and each has been used by scientists to a large extent for overlapping purposes.

==Potential problems==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2012}} 
Denouncing the project since its outset, some [[indigenous communities]], [[NGO]]s, and [[human rights organizations]] have objected to the HGDP's goals based on perceived issues of [[scientific racism]], [[colonialism]], [[biocolonialism (patenting)]], [[informed consent]], and the prospect of [[biological warfare]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

'''Racism'''
The [[ETC Group (AGETC)|Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration (ETC Group)]] has been a major critic of the HGDP, speculating that issues of racism and stigmatization could occur should the HGDP be completed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}  One major concern with the research project has been the potential, in certain countries, for [[racism]] resulting from use of HGDP data. Critics feel that when governments are armed with genetic data linked to certain racial groups, those governments might deny human rights based on this genetic data. For example, countries could define races purely in genetic terms and deny a certain person right(s) based on lack of conformity to a certain race's genetic model.

'''Uneven Application'''
Eight of nine DNA groups under Ctrl/South category belong to Pakistan even though India is in the same group with about seven times the population of Pakistan and with far more numerous racial diversities. However, it is noteworthy that Rosenberg et al. found that the sampled Pakistani populations are more genetically diverse than 15 Indian populations that were explicitly compared&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020215 |title=Low Levels of Genetic Divergence across Geographically and Linguistically Diverse Populations from India |year=2006 |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Noah A. |last2=Mahajan |first2=Saurabh |last3=Gonzalez-Quevedo |first3=Catalina |last4=Blum |first4=Michael G.

'''Use of Genetic Data for Non-medical Purposes'''
Use of HGDP genetic materials for nonmedical purposes not agreed to by indigenous donors, especially purposes that create possibilities for human rights violations, has been a matter of concern.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} For example, Kidd et al. described the use of DNA samples from indigenous populations to explore a forensic identification capability based on ethnic origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2005.11.017 |title=Developing a SNP panel for forensic identification of individuals |year=2006 |last1=Kidd |first1=Kenneth K. |last2=Pakstis |first2=Andrew J. |last3=Speed |first3=William C. |last4=Grigorenko |first4=Elena L. |last5=Kajuna |first5=Sylvester L.B. |last6=Karoma |first6=Nganyirwa J. |last7=Kungulilo |first7=Selemani |last8=Kim |first8=Jong-Jin |last9=Lu |first9=Ru-Band |last10=Odunsi |first10=Adekunle |last11=Okonofua |first11=Friday |last12=Parnas |first12=Josef |last13=Schulz |first13=Leslie O. |last14=Zhukova |first14=Olga V. |last15=Kidd |first15=Judith R. |journal=Forensic Science International |volume=164 |pages=20–32 |pmid=16360294 |issue=1|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Creating Artificial Genetic Distinctions'''
Anthropologist [[Jonathan M. Marks]] stated: "As any anthropologist knows, ethnic groups are categories of human invention, not given by nature."&lt;ref name="marks"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marks |first=Jonathan |year=2002 |title=What it means to be 98% chimpanzee |pages=202-7 |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-22615-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[indigenous peoples]] have refused to take part in the HGDP due to concerns about misuse of the data: "In December [1993], a World Council of Indigenous Peoples in Guatemala repudiated the HGDP."&lt;ref name="marks"/&gt;

==Alternative approaches==
In 1995, the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC) issued its recommendations on the HGDP. The NRC endorsed the concept of diversity research, also pointing out some concerns with the HGDP procedure. The NRC report suggested alternatives such as keeping sample sources anonymous (i.e., sampling genetic data without tying it to specific racial groups). While such approaches would eliminate the concerns discussed above (regarding racism, weapons development, etc.), they would also prevent researchers from achieving many of the benefits that were to be gained from the project.

Some members of the [[Human Genome Project|Human Genome Project (HGP)]] argued in favor of engaging in diversity research on data gleaned from the '''Human Genome Diversity Project''', although most agreed that diversity research should be done by the HGP and not as a separate project.

A number of the principal collaborators in the HGDP have been involved in the privately funded [[Genographic Project]] launched in April 2005 with similar aims.

== Replication of the statistical analysis ==
An independent replication study of the variations of Europe and Middle East &amp; North Africa individuals was published in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charlon|first=Thomas|last2=Cara|first2=Alessandro Di|last3=Voloshynovskiy|first3=Sviatoslav|last4=Wojcik|first4=Jérôme|date=2017-03-15|title=Replication of the principal component analyses of the human genome diversity panel|url=https://f1000research.com/articles/6-278/v1|journal=F1000Research|volume=6|doi=10.12688/f1000research.11055.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the publicly available data sets, the study confirmed that different population structures were observed within each geographical region. The corresponding [[R (programming language)|R]] source code&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/ThomasChln/reproducible-hgdp|title=ThomasChln/reproducible-hgdp|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Docker (software)|Docker]] image&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hub.docker.com/r/thomaschln/reproducible-hgdp/|title=Replication docker image|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were also published to enable the [[reproducibility]] of the study.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1525">'''Hylogenesis''' is a [[Physics|physical]] [[Scientific theory|theory]] about the mechanism behind the origins of [[dark matter]] and [[antimatter]]. It was proposed in August 2010 in a paper by Hooman Davoudiasl, David E. Morrissey, [[Kris Sigurdson]] and Sean Tulin.&lt;ref name=first&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2399&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory involves a [[fermion]] X, and its antiparticle {{overline|X}}, both of which may couple into [[quark]]s in the visible sector, and into hidden particles in a hidden sector, a sector which is not part of the [[Standard Model]]. The hidden states have masses near a GeV and very weak couplings to particles in the Standard Model. X and {{overline|X}} respectively decay into either [[Baryon|baryonic]] matter or hidden baryonic matter, and into either antibaryonic matter or hidden antibaryonic matter, violating [[CP-violation|CP]] and quark [[baryon number]].&lt;ref name=first/&gt;

An excess of baryonic matter is created in the visible sector, and an excess of antimatter is created in the hidden sector. The hidden antimatter is explained as being stable dark matter. The X and {{overline|X}} particles have a conserved baryon number charge, so equal and opposite charges appear in the visible and hidden sectors. Therefore, the Universe's total baryon charge stays zero.&lt;ref name=first/&gt;

The '''''International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants''''' ('''ICN''') is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal [[botanical name]]s  that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms, all those "traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants".&lt;ref name="ShenzhenCode"&gt;{{Cite book |year=2018 |editor-last=Turland |editor-first=N.J. |displayeditors=etal|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Shenzhen Code) adopted by the Nineteenth International Botanical Congress Shenzhen, China, July 2017 |edition=electronic |publication-place=Glashütten |publisher=International Association for Plant Taxonomy |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php |accessdate=2018-06-27 |lastauthoramp=yes |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Preamble, para. 8}} It was formerly called the '''''International Code of Botanical Nomenclature''''' ('''ICBN'''); the name was changed at the [[International Botanical Congress]] in [[Melbourne]] in July 2011 as part of the ''Melbourne Code''&lt;ref name="MelbourneCode"&gt;{{Cite book |year=2012 |editor-last=McNeill |editor-first=J. |displayeditors=etal|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code), Adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |edition=electronic |publication-place=Bratislava |publisher=International Association for Plant Taxonomy |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php |accessdate=2012-12-20 |lastauthoramp=yes |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which replaced the ''Vienna Code'' of 2005.

The current version of the code is the ''Shenzhen Code'' adopted by the [[International Botanical Congress]] held in [[Shenzhen]], China, in July 2017. As with previous codes, it took effect as soon as it was ratified by the congress (on 29 July 2017), but the documentation of the code in its final form was not published until 26 June 2018.

The name of the ''Code'' is partly capitalized and partly not. The lower-case for "algae, fungi, and plants" indicates that these terms are not formal names of [[clade]]s, but indicate groups of organisms that were historically known by these names and traditionally studied by [[phycology|phycologists]], [[mycology|mycologists]], and [[botany|botanists]]. This includes blue-green algae ([[Cyanobacteria]]); [[fungi]], including [[chytrid]]s, [[oomycete]]s, and [[slime mould]]s; [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[protists]] and [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomically]] related non-photosynthetic groups. There are special provisions in the ''ICN'' for some of these groups, as there are for [[fossil]]s.

The ''ICN'' can only be changed by an International Botanical Congress (IBC), with the [[International Association for Plant Taxonomy]] providing the supporting infrastructure. Each new edition supersedes the earlier editions and is retroactive back to 1753, except where different starting dates are specified.&lt;ref name="ShenzhenCode" /&gt;{{rp|Principle VI}}

For the naming of cultivated plants there is a separate code, the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]]'', which gives rules and recommendations that supplement the ''ICN''.

== Principles ==
* Botanical nomenclature is independent of zoological, bacteriological, and viral nomenclature (see [[Nomenclature codes]]).
* A botanical name is fixed to a taxon by a [[type (botany)|type]].&lt;ref name="ShenzhenCode" /&gt;{{rp|Article 7}} This is almost invariably dried plant material and is usually deposited and preserved in a [[herbarium]], although it may also be an image or a preserved culture. Some type collections can be viewed online at the websites of the herbaria in question.
* A guiding principle in [[botanical nomenclature]] is priority, the first publication of a name for a taxon.&lt;ref name="ShenzhenCode" /&gt;{{rp|Principle III}} The formal starting date for purposes of priority is 1 May 1753, the publication of ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]. However, to avoid undesirable (destabilizing) effects of strict enforcement of priority, [[conservation (botany)|conservation]] of family, genus, and species names is possible.
* The intent of the Code is that each taxonomic group ("[[taxon]]", plural "taxa") of plants has only one [[correct name (botany)|correct name]] that is accepted worldwide, provided that it has the same [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]], position and [[Taxonomic rank|rank]].&lt;ref name="ShenzhenCode" /&gt;{{rp|Principle IV}} The value of a scientific name is that it is an [[identifier]]; it is not necessarily of descriptive value.
* Names of taxa are treated as Latin.
* The rules of nomenclature are retroactive unless there is an explicit statement that this does not apply.

== History ==
{{Main article|International Botanical Congress}}
The rules governing botanical nomenclature have a long and tumultuous history, dating back to dissatisfaction with rules that were established in 1843 to govern zoological nomenclature.&lt;ref name=Nicholson&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nicolson, D.H. |year=1991 |title= A History of Botanical Nomenclature |journal=Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden|volume=78|issue=1|pages=33–56|jstor=2399589|doi=10.2307/2399589}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first set of international rules was the ''Lois de la nomenclature botanique'' ("Laws of botanical nomenclature") that was adopted as the "best guide to follow for botanical nomenclature"&lt;ref name=Nicholson/&gt; at an "International Botanical Congress" convened in [[Paris]] in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S-QkAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=[[Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle]]|year=1867 |title= Lois de la nomenclature botanique adoptées par le Congrès International de Botanique tenu à Paris en août 1867 suivies d'une deuxième édition de l'introduction historique et du commentaire qui accompagnaient la rédaction préparatoire présentée au congrès|publisher=J.-B. Baillière et fils|location=Genève et Bâle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle]]|year=1868|title=Laws of Botanical Nomenclature adopted by the International Botanical Congress held at Paris in August 1867; together with an Historical Introduction and Commentary by Alphonse de Candolle, Translated from the French|others=translated by [[Hugh Algernon Weddell]]|publisher=L. Reeve and Co|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924001723604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike modern codes, it was not enforced. It was organized as six sections with 68 articles in total.

Multiple attempts to bring more "expedient" or more equitable practice to botanical nomenclature resulted in several competing codes, which finally reached a compromise with the 1930 congress.&lt;ref name=Nicholson/&gt; In the meantime, the second edition of the international rules followed the [[Vienna]] congress in 1905. These rules were published as the ''Règles internationales de la Nomenclature botanique adoptées par le Congrès International de Botanique de Vienne 1905'' (or in English, ''International rules of Botanical Nomenclature adopted by the International Botanical Conference of Vienna 1905''). Informally they are referred to as the ''Vienna Rules'' (not to be confused with the ''Vienna Code'' of 2006).

Some but not all subsequent meetings of the International Botanical Congress have produced revised versions of these ''Rules'', later called the ''International Code of Botanical Nomenclature'', and then ''International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants''.

The Nomenclature Section of the 18th International Botanical Congress in Melbourne, Australia (2011) made major changes:&lt;ref name="MelbourneCode"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller JS, Funk VA, Wagner WL, Barrie F, Hoch PC, Herendeen P | year = 2011 | title = Outcomes of the 2011 Botanical Nomenclature Section at the XVIII International Botanical Congress | journal = PhytoKeys | volume = 5 | pages = 1–3 | doi = 10.3897/phytokeys.5.1850 | pmid = 22171188 | issue = 5 | pmc = 3174450 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John McNeill, 2011. Important decisions of the Nomenclature Section of the XVIII International Botanical Congress, Melbourne, 18–22 July 2011.

* The ''Code'' now permits electronic-only publication of names of new taxa; no longer will it be a requirement to deposit some paper copies in libraries.
* The requirement for a Latin validating diagnosis or description was changed to allow either English or Latin for these essential components of the publication of a new name (Article 39).
* "[[One fungus, one name]]" and "one fossil, one name" are important changes; the concepts of ''[[anamorph]]'' and ''[[teleomorph]]'' (for fungi) and ''[[morphotaxa]]'' (for fossils) have been eliminated.
* As an experiment with "registration of names", new fungal descriptions require the use of an identifier from "a recognized repository"; there are two recognized repositories so far, [[Index Fungorum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Index Fungorum Registration|url=http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/IndexFungorumRegistration.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[MycoBank]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8079">The '''KBS Tuff''' (Kay Behrensmeyer Tuff) is an [[Volcanic ash|ash layer]] in [[East African Rift Valley]] sediments, derived from a [[volcanic eruption]] that occurred approximately 1.87 million years ago (Ma). The [[tuff]] is widely distributed geographically, and marks a significant transition between water flow and associated environmental conditions around [[Lake Turkana]] shortly after 2 Ma.

Between 1970-1985 the age of the tuff was the subject of intense academic dispute, with a variety of dates proposed by different geochemical and paleontological laboratories. This dispute came to be known as the KBS Tuff Controversy.

The KBS Tuff has been described as "the [[Turkana Basin]]’s most celebrated tephrostratigraphic marker."&lt;ref name="feibel2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feibel|first1=Craig|title=A Geological History of the Turkana Basin|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology|date=2011|volume=20|pages=206–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:National Museums of Kenya Koobi Fora Hq.jpg|thumb|The National Museums of Kenya [[Koobi Fora]] offices and camp, [[Sibiloi National Park]]. The KBS Tuff is found in Koobi Fora.]]
The KBS Tuff was first reported and described by [[Kay Behrensmeyer]] (hence "KBS", Kay Behrensmeyer Site) in sediments that belong to Omo Group deposits in southern [[Ethiopia]] and northern [[Kenya]]. Within this larger group, the KBS has been found in the [[Shungura Formation]] in southern Ethiopia, In the [[Nachukui Formation]] on the west side of [[Lake Turkana]] in northern Kenya, and in the [[Koobi Fora Formation]] on the east side of Lake Turkana.&lt;ref name="feibel1989" /&gt;

==Age and chronological sequence==

[[Argon-argon dating]] has placed the age of the KBS Tuff at 1.869 ± 0.021 Ma.&lt;ref name="bmg0213"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Francis|last2=McDougall|first2=Ian|last3=Gathogo|first3=Patrick|editor1-last=Reed|editor1-first=Kay|editor2-last=Fleagle|editor2-first=John|editor3-last=Leakey|editor3-first=Richard|title=The Paleobiology of Australopithecus|date=2013|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|pages=8–11|accessdate=11 November 2017|chapter=Age Ranges of Australopithecus Species, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Tanzania}}&lt;/ref&gt; This age estimate is supported by independent [[Fission track dating|fission track]] and [[Potassium-argon dating|K/Ar dating]] methods.&lt;ref name="feibel1989" /&gt; KBS is situated above the older Kangaki (2.063 Ma), G-3 (2.188 Ma) and Kalochoro (2.331 Ma) tuffs, and below the younger Malbe (1.843 Ma), Morutot (1.607 Ma) and Lower Ileret (1.527 Ma) tuffs.&lt;ref name="bmg0213" /&gt; In some locations tuffs with chemical compositions identical to the KBS tuff have been found in multiple, distinct layers, suggesting that deposition of the layers occurred at various times after eruption.&lt;ref name="feibel1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feibel|first1=Craig|last2=Brown|first2=Francis|last3=McDougall|first3=Ian|title=Stratigraphic Context of Fossil Hominids From the Omo Group Deposits: Northern Turkana Basin, Kenya and Ethiopia|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|date=1989|volume=78|pages=595–622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Omo group deposits, the KBS tuff separates distinct sedimentary members of the Nachukui and Foobi Fora formations. In the Nachukui (western) formation, KBS divides the older Kalochoro from the younger Kaitio member. In the Koobi Fora formation, it separates the older Burgi from the younger KBS member.&lt;ref name="feibel1989" /&gt;

==Environmental context==

The KBS Tuff marks a transition in the Turkana Basin from a stable to a fluctuating lake, partly filled by a river and delta system to the north and east of the basin.&lt;ref name="RHC1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=Michael|last2=Harris|first2=John|last3=Craig|first3=Feibel|title=Changing patterns land use Plio-Pleistocene hominids Lake Turkana Basin|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=1994|volume=27|pages=139–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated hominin remains==

In Koobi Fora, on the eastern side of Lake Turkana, a substantial number of hominin fossils have been found immediately below or above the KBS Tuff.&lt;ref name="feibel1989" /&gt; A partial list is provided below, including a few specimens from north and west Lake Turkana.

==KBS Tuff controversy==

The KBS Tuff was first dated in 1969, after Behrensmeyer discovered stone tools at Koobi Fora in the layer of the Tuff. Argon/Argon dating was performed by Frank Fitch at Birckbeck College in London and Jack Miller at the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, UK, who found a most likely age of 2.61 Ma for the KBS eruption.&lt;ref name="fitchmiller"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fitch|first1=FJ|last2=Miller|first2=JA|title=Radioisotopic Age Determinations of Lake Rudolf Artefact Site|journal=Nature|date=1970|volume=226|pages=226–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; This find had important implications for the anthropological community because it provided a very old age for the tools found by Behresmeyer, and for associated crania including KNM-ER 1470, attributed to the genus ''Homo''.&lt;ref name="lewin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewin|first1=Roger|title=Bones of Contention: Controversies in the Search for Human Origins|date=1997|publisher=University of Chicago Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hoBZmtfO-0AC|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The date was called into question because efforts to replicate the findings produced KBS Tuff ages ranging from less than 1 to over 220 Ma. A study of pig molar anatomy from the site, by Vincent Maglio and Basil Cooke, suggested an age closer to 2 Ma or even less, using methods of biogeochronology.&lt;ref name="lewin" /&gt; Similar investigation using antelope remains by Alan Gentry at the British Museum of Natural History also contradicted the Argon-Argon 2.6 Ma Tuff.&lt;ref name="lewin" /&gt; Another problem that emerged was that the 2.6 Ma date for the KBS Tuff, provided by Fitch and Miller, made alignment of the Koobi Fora (east Turkana) geochronology with the Omo (north Turkana) geochronology impossible.&lt;ref name="lewin" /&gt;

The conflict was resolved after geochemist Garniss Curtis and his student [[Thure E. Cerling]] conducted independent investigations of the age of the KBS Tuff using Argon-Argon and Potassium-Argon dating at the Berkeley Geochronology Laboratory. Curtis and Cerling found that the material dated by the Cambridge team actually belonged to two separate tuffs, which they estimated at 1.8 and 1.6 Ma.&lt;ref name="lewin" /&gt; This date was confirmed by Potassium-Argon dating conducted by Ian McDougall, and later Fission-Track dating conducted by Andy Gleadow.&lt;ref name="lewin" /&gt;

'''Krogh's principle''' states that "for such a large number of problems there will be some animal of choice, or a few such animals, on which it can be most conveniently studied." This concept is central to those disciplines of [[biology]] that rely on the [[comparative method]], such as [[neuroethology]], [[comparative physiology]], and more recently [[functional genomics]].

==History==
Krogh's principle is named after the Danish physiologist [[August Krogh]], winner of the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Physiology]] for his contributions to understanding the anatomy and physiology of the [[capillary|capillary system]], who described it in The American Journal of Physiology in 1929.   However, the principle was first elucidated nearly 60 years prior to this, and in almost the same words as Krogh, in 1865 by [[Claude Bernard]], the French instigator of experimental medicine, on page 27 of his "Introduction à l'étude de la médecine expérimentale":
{{quote|

Dans l'investigation scientifique, les moindres procédés sont de la plus haute importance. '''Le choix heureux d'un animal''', d'un instrument construit d'une certaine façon, l'emploi d'un réactif au lieu d'un autre, suffisent souvent pour résoudre les questions générales les plus élevées.

Claude Bernard: ''Introduction à l'étude de la médecine expérimentale'', J.B. Baillière et Fils, Libraires de L'Académie Impériale de Médecine, 1865. pp. 400}}

Krogh wrote the following in his 1929 treatise on the then current 'status' of physiology (emphasis added):
{{quote|

...I want to emphasize that the route by which we can strive toward the ideal is by a study of the vital functions in all their aspects throughout the myriads of [[organism]]s. We may find out, nay, we will find out before very long the essential mechanisms of [[mammal]]ian [[renal function|kidney function]], but the general problem of [[excretion]] can be solved only when excretory [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s are studied wherever we find them and in all their essential modifications. Such studies will be sure, moreover, to expand and deepen our insight into problems of the [[human]] [[kidney]] and will prove of value also from the narrowest [[utilitarian]] point of view.

'''For such a large number of problems there will be some animal of choice or a few such animals on which it can be most conveniently studied'''.  Many years ago when my teacher, [[Christian Bohr]], was interested in the [[respiratory system|respiratory]] mechanism of the [[lung]] and devised the method of studying the exchange through each lung separately, he found that a certain kind of [[tortoise]] possessed a [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]] dividing into the main [[bronchus|bronchi]] high up in the neck, and we used to say as a laboratory joke that this animal had been created expressly for the purposes of [[respiration (physiology)|respiration physiology]].  I have no doubt that there is quite a number of animals which are similarly "created" for special [[physiology|physiological]] purposes, but I am afraid that most of them are unknown to the men for whom they were "created," and we must apply to the [[zoologist]]s to find them and lay our hands on them."

August Krogh ''The Progress of Physiology'', The American Journal of Physiology, 1929. 90(2) pp. 243-251}}

"Krogh's principle" was not utilized as a formal term until 1975 when the biochemist [[Hans Adolf Krebs]] (who initially described the [[Citric Acid Cycle]]), first referred to it.

More recently, at the International Society for Neuroethology meeting in [[Nyborg]], [[Denmark]] in 2004, Krogh's principle was cited as a central principle by the group at their 7th Congress.  Krogh's principle has also been receiving attention in the area of [[functional genomics]], where there has been increasing pressure and desire to expand genomics research to a more wide variety of organisms beyond the traditional scope of the field.

==Philosophy and applications==
A central concept to Krogh's principle is evolutionary adaptation.  Evolutionary theory maintains that organisms are suited to particular [[Ecological niche|niches]], some of which are highly specialized for solving particular biological problems.  These adaptations are typically exploited by biologists in several ways:

[[Image:Thermus aquaticus.JPG|thumb|''Thermus aquaticus'']]
*'''Methodology''': (e.g. [[Taq polymerase]] and [[PCR]]): The need to manipulate biological systems in the laboratory has driven the use of an organismal specialization.  One example of Krogh's principle presents itself in the heavily used [[Polymerase Chain Reaction]] (PCR), a method which relies on the rapid exposure of [[DNA]] to high heat for amplification of particular sequences of interest.  [[DNA polymerase]] [[enzyme]] from many organisms would denature at high temperatures, however, to solve this problem, Chien and colleagues turned to ''[[Thermus aquaticus]]'', a strain of bacteria native to [[hydrothermal vent]]s.  ''Thermus aquaticus'' has a polymerase that is heat stable at temperatures necessary for PCR.  Biochemically modified Taq polymerase, as it is usually called, is now routinely used in PCR applications.
*'''Overcoming technical limitations''': (e.g. large  [[neuron]]s in [[Mollusca]]):  Two Nobel Prize–winning bodies of study were facilitated by using ideas central to Krogh's principle to overcome technical limitations in [[nervous system]] physiology.  The [[ion channel|ionic basis]] of the [[action potential]] was elucidated in the [[squid giant axon]] in 1958 by [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley]], developers of the original [[voltage clamp]] device and co-recipients of the 1963 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].  The voltage clamp is now a central piece of technology in modern [[neurophysiology]], but was only possible to develop using the wide diameter of the squid giant axon.  Another marine mollusc, the [[opisthobranch]] [[Aplysia]] possesses relatively small number of large [[nerve cell]]s that are easily identified and mapped from individual to individual.  Aplysia was selected for these reasons for the study of the cellular and molecular basis of learning and memory which led to [[Eric Kandel]]'s receipt of the Nobel Prize in 2000.

[[Image:Tyto alba close up.jpg|thumb|''Tyto alba'', the Barn Owl]]
*'''Understanding more complex/subtle systems''' (e.g. [[Barn owls]] and [[sound localization]]):  Beyond overcoming technical limitations, Krogh's principle has particularly important implications in the light of [[convergent evolution]] and [[homology (biology)|homology]].  Either because of evolutionary history, or particular constraints on a given niche, there are not infinite solutions to all biological problems.  Instead, organisms utilize similar neural algorithms, behaviors, or even structures to accomplish similar tasks.  If one's goal is to understand how the nervous system might localize objects using sound, one may take the approach of using an [[auditory system|auditory]] 'specialist' such as the barn owl studied by [[Masakazu Konishi|Mark Konishi]], [[Eric Knudsen]] and their colleagues.  A [[nocturnal]] [[predator]] by nature, the barn owl relies heavily on using precise information on the time of arrival of sound in its ears.  The information gleaned from this approach has contributed heavily to our understanding of how the brain maps sensory space, and how nervous systems encode timing information.

This software may include applications for [[computer-aided design]] (CAD), [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE), [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) and [[product data management]] (PDM).

The list is far from complete or representative as the CAD business landscape is very dynamic: almost every month new companies appear, old companies go out of business, companies split and merge. Sometimes some names disappear and reappear again.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16153">The national '''flag of [[Estonia]]''' is a [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]] featuring three equal horizontal bands of [[blue]] (top), [[black]], and [[white]]. The normal size is 105 × 165&amp;nbsp;cm. In [[Estonian language|Estonian]] it is colloquially called the "''sinimustvalge''" (literally "blue-black-white"), after the colours of the bands. The flag became associated with [[Estonians|Estonian]] [[nationalism]] and was used as the [[national flag]] (''riigilipp'') when the [[Estonian Declaration of Independence]] was issued on February 24, 1918. The flag was formally adopted on November 21, 1918. On December 12, 1918 was the first time the flag was raised as the national symbol atop of the [[Pikk Hermann]] Tower in Tallinn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estemb.org/estonia/history/aid-780 Estonia's Blue-Black-White Tricolour Flag at estemb.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="85790">This is a '''list of countries and territories by land and maritime borders'''. For each country or territory, the number and identity of other countries and territories that neighbor it are listed. Land [[border]]s and [[ocean|maritime]] boundaries are included and are tabulated separately and in combination. For purposes of this list, "[[maritime boundary]]" includes boundaries that are recognized by the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], which includes boundaries of [[territorial waters]], [[contiguous zone]]s, and [[exclusive economic zone]]s. However, it does not include [[lake]] or [[river]] boundaries, which are considered land boundaries.

Also included is the number of unique [[sovereign states]]&lt;ref name = sovereign&gt;The concept of [[sovereign state|state sovereignty]] is somewhat imprecise and there are disagreements about whether certain territories are sovereign. There are currently [[List of sovereign states#Internationally recognized sovereign states|195 states]] that are generally regarded as "fully" sovereign: this includes the [[United Nations member states|193 member states]] of the [[United Nations]] plus the observer states of [[Vatican City]] and the [[State of Palestine]]. Some of these states have under their jurisdiction [[Territory (administrative division)|territories, dependencies, or collectivities]] that are clearly non-sovereign geographical areas. These territories are generally regarded as being subsumed within the overarching sovereignty of the governing state. For example, the [[United Kingdom]] holds sovereignty over the territory of [[Gibraltar]], even though Gibraltar is not considered to be part of the United Kingdom. There are a few territories in the world that are neither clearly sovereign nor clearly subsumed under another state's sovereignty. Often, these territories have declared themselves to be sovereign, but they are either not widely recognized as such or lack some of the necessary conditions for sovereign statehood. In these cases, explanatory footnotes indicate how the territory is treated for the purposes of this list.&lt;/ref&gt; that a country or territory shares as neighbors. If the number is higher due to multiple dependencies or [[List of unrecognized states|unrecognized states]] bordering the state, the larger number is shown in brackets.

Footnotes are provided to provide clarity regarding the status of certain countries and territories.

|'''''{{flag|Abkhazia}}'''''&lt;ref name = abkhazia&gt;In 1992, Abkhazia declared sovereignty from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Georgia disputes the declaration and considers Abkhazia to be part of its territory. The only sovereign states that recognize Abkhazia's sovereignty are [[Russia]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Nauru]]. Because of the low level of international recognition, Abkhazia is not considered a sovereign state for the purposes of this list and is not included in other countries' listings of neighboring countries and territories.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is because it considers the entire [[Kashmir]] region to be a part of India including the portion bordering Afghanistan. A ceasefire sponsored by the UN in 1948 froze the positions of Indian and Pakistani-held territory. As a consequence, the region bordering Afghanistan is in Pakistan's [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] area.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{flag|Tajikistan}} (L)&lt;br&gt;{{flag|Turkmenistan}} (L)&lt;br&gt;{{flag|Uzbekistan}} (L)

Cyprus disputes the declaration of sovereignty and considers Northern Cyprus to be part of its territory. The [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]] also do not recognize the sovereignty of Northern Cyprus. The only sovereign state that recognizes Northern Cyprus's sovereignty is Turkey. Northern Cyprus also lacks some of the indicators of legal sovereignty, relying heavily on Turkey for its continuing existence separate from Cyprus. Because of these factors, Northern Cyprus is not considered a sovereign state for the purposes of this list and is not included in other countries' listings of neighboring countries and territories.&lt;/ref&gt;

|'''''{{flag|Kosovo}}'''''&lt;ref name = kosovo&gt;In 2008, Kosovo declared independence from [[Serbia]]. Although Kosovo's sovereignty has been recognized by {{Numrec|Kos||UN member states}}, Serbia disputes its sovereignty, claiming that Kosovo remains one of its provinces. Serbia referred the dispute to the [[International Court of Justice]], which ruled that the declaration of independence was legal. For purposes of this list, Kosovo is considered to be a sovereign country. If Kosovo is considered part of Serbia, some numbers in the table would be reduced by one (e.g., when a state borders both Serbia and Kosovo). Other numbers would remain the same (e.g., when a state borders Kosovo but not Serbia).&lt;/ref&gt;

|'''''{{flag|Taiwan}}'''''&lt;ref&gt;In 1949, during the [[Chinese Civil War]], the government and leaders of the [[Republic of China]] (ROC), led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]], retreated from mainland China to the island of [[Taiwan]]. In Taiwan, the ROC continues to claim sovereignty over ''all'' China, including the mainland and Taiwan. The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), which has governed mainland China since the ROC government retreated, also claims to be the sole representative of ''all'' China, including Taiwan. Even though the ROC government in Taiwan has never asserted that Taiwan's sovereignty is separate from that of China's, for many practical purposes Taiwan is treated by other countries and international organizations as a country that is separate from the PRC. For the purposes of this list, Taiwan is considered to be an entity that is separate from China.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3567">This is a '''list of old [[Macintosh]] [[software]]''' that no longer runs on current Macs. The software might require [[Mac OS 9]] or other versions of the [[classic Mac OS]] that can't run on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s current [[Apple–Intel architecture|Intel machines]]. Note that most old programs can still be run using [[emulator]]s, such as [[SheepShaver]], [[vMac]], or [[Basilisk II]].

For a list of current programs, see [[List of Macintosh software]]. Third-party databases include [https://web.archive.org/web/20060706064832/http://www.versiontracker.com/macosx/ VersionTracker],  [http://www.macupdate.com/ MacUpdate] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20101002165340/http://osx.iusethis.com/ iUseThis]. Since a list like this might grow too big and become unmanageable, this list is confined to those programs for which a Wikipedia article exists.

'''Luigi Bellardi''' (18 May 1818 – 17 September 1889) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[malacologist]] and [[entomologist]] who specialised in [[Diptera]].

Bellardi was born in [[Genoa]] and died in [[Turin]]. His collection is in the [[Turin Museum of Natural History]]

In 1872, then a Professor at Liceo Gioberti, Luigi Bellardi began ''I molluschi dei terreni terziari del Piemonte della Liguria'', a work on molluscs of the Middle and Early [[Tertiary]] in the [[Mediterranean basin]]. In 1888 he published the five parts dealing with [[Cephalopoda]], [[Sea butterfly|Pteropoda]] and the first families of [[Gastropoda]]. In 1889 his student Prof. [[Federico Sacco]] (1864–1948) took over this work and published 25 more sections partly based on Bellardi’s work on this species-rich fossil group.

'''Multiomics''' refers to a biological analysis approach in which the data sets are multiple "[[omes]]", such as the [[genome]], [[proteome]], [[transcriptome]], [[epigenome]], and [[microbiome]];&lt;ref name="Bersanelli"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bersanelli|first1=Matteo|last2=Mosca|first2=Ettore|last3=Remondini|first3=Daniel|last4=Giampieri|first4=Enrico|last5=Sala|first5=Claudia|last6=Castellani|first6=Gastone|last7=Milanesi|first7=Luciano|title=Methods for the integration of multi-omics data: mathematical aspects|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|date=1 January 2016|volume=17|issue=2|pages=S15|doi=10.1186/s12859-015-0857-9|url=https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-015-0857-9|accessdate=31 October 2016|issn=1471-2105|pmid=26821531|pmc=4959355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bock"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bock|first1=Christoph|last2=Farlik|first2=Matthias|last3=Sheffield|first3=Nathan C.|title=Multi-Omics of Single Cells: Strategies and Applications|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|date=August 2016|volume=34|issue=8|pages=605–608|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2016.04.004|url=http://www.cell.com/trends/biotechnology/fulltext/S0167-7799(16)30023-3|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vilanova"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vilanova|first1=Cristina|last2=Porcar|first2=Manuel|title=Are multi-omics enough?|journal=Nature Microbiology|date=26 July 2016|volume=1|issue=8|pages=16101|doi=10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.101|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol2016101|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other words, ''the use of multiple [[omics]] technologies to study life in a concerted way''. By combining these omes into a set of omes, scientists can analyze complex biololgical [[big data]] efficiently enough to easily find relevant [[biomarkers]]. In so doing, multiomics integrates diverse omics data to find a coherently matching geno-pheno-envirotype relationship or association, even with reduced numbers of samples, although multiomics usually involves 'big' data.

Usually, a very large number of samples is required to detect functional relationships, but, using multiomics, encompassing multiple data types, researchers try to detect such associations with more confidence. A possible example case would be suicide [[biomarker]] detection by taking the blood of [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]] patients and performing genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic sequencing, combining these omes to find significant markers from the case population.

'''Prehistoric technology''' is [[technology]] that predates [[recorded history]]. History is the study of the past using written records. Anything prior to the first written accounts of history is [[Prehistory|prehistoric]], including earlier technologies. About 2.5 million years before writing was developed, technology began with the earliest [[hominid]]s who used [[stone tool]]s, which they may have used to start fires, hunt, and bury their dead.

There are several factors that made the evolution of prehistoric technology possible or necessary. One of the key factors is [[behavioral modernity]] of the [[Encephalization|highly developed brain]] of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''  capable of abstract [[reasoning]], [[language]], [[introspection]], and [[problem solving]]. The advent of agriculture resulted in lifestyle changes from nomadic lifestyles to ones lived in homes, with domesticated animals, and land farmed using more varied and sophisticated tools. Art, architecture, music and religion evolved over the course of the prehistoric periods.

{{Human timeline}}

=== Stone Age ===
The [[Stone Age]] is a broad prehistoric period during which stone was widely used in the manufacture of implements with a sharp edge, a point, or a percussion surface. The period lasted roughly 2.5 million years, from the time of early hominids to ''Homo sapiens'' in the later Pleistocene era, and largely ended between 6000 and 2000 BCE with the advent of metalworking.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The Stone Age lifestyle was that of [[hunter-gatherer]]s who traveled to hunt game and gather wild plants, with minimal changes in technology. As the [[last glacial period|last glacial period of the current ice age]] neared its end (about 12,500 years ago), [[megafauna|large animals]] like the [[mammoth]] and [[bison antiquus]] became extinct and the climate changed.  Humans adapted by maximizing the resources in local environments, gathering and eating a wider range of wild plants and hunting or catching smaller game.  [[Domestication]] of plants and animals with early stages in the [[Old World]] ([[Afro-Eurasia]]) [[Mesolithic]] and New World ([[Americas]]) [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] periods led to significant changes and reliance on agriculture in the Old World [[Neolithic]] and New World [[Formative stage]].  The agricultural life led to more settled existences and significant technological advancements.&lt;ref&gt;Cassells, E. Steve. (1997). ''The Archaeology of Colorado'', Revised Edition. Boulder, Colorado: Johnson Books. pp. 6-14. {{ISBN|1-55566-193-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|During the [[Paleolithic Age]], [[archaic humans]] had a lifestyle which involved limited use of tools and few permanent settlements. The first major technologies, then, were tied to survival, hunting, and food preparation in this environment.  Fire, stone tools and weapons, and clothing were technological developments of major importance during this period. Stone Age cultures developed [[Prehistoric music|music]], and engaged in organized [[Prehistoric warfare|warfare]]. A subset of Stone Age humans, including [[Ngaro people|Ngaro Aborigines]], developed ocean-worthy [[outrigger canoe]] technology, leading to an eastward [[History of Papua New Guinea|migration]] across the [[Malay archipelago]], across the Indian ocean to [[Madagascar]] and also across the Pacific Ocean, which required knowledge of the ocean currents, weather patterns, sailing, [[celestial navigation]], and star maps. The early Stone Age is described as [[Epipaleolithic]] or [[Mesolithic]]. The former is generally used to describe the early Stone Age in areas with limited glacial impact. The later Stone Age, during which the rudiments of agricultural technology were developed, is called the [[Neolithic]] period. During this period, polished [[stone tool]]s were made from a variety of hard rocks such as [[flint]], [[jade]], [[jadeite]] and [[Greenschist|greenstone]], largely by working exposures as quarries, but later the valuable rocks were pursued by tunnelling underground, the first steps in mining technology. The polished axes were used for forest clearance and the establishment of crop farming, and were so effective as to remain in use when bronze and iron appeared.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}|group="nb"}}

Although Paleolithic cultures left no written records, the shift from nomadic life to settlement and agriculture can be inferred from a range of archaeological evidence. Such evidence includes ancient tools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/01/0114_040114_siberianhumans.html|title=Ancient Tools Unearthed in Siberian Arctic|author=|date=|website=news.nationalgeographic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cave painting]]s, and other [[prehistoric art]], such as the [[Venus of Willendorf]]. Human remains also provide direct evidence, both through the examination of bones, and the study of [[mummy|mummies]]. Though concrete evidence is limited, scientists and historians have been able to form significant inferences about the lifestyle and culture of various prehistoric peoples, and the role technology played in their lives.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==== Lower Paleolithic ====
The [[Lower Paleolithic]] period was the earliest subdivision of the [[Paleolithic]] or Old [[Stone Age]]. It spans the time from around [[1 E13 s|2.5 million year]]s ago when the first evidence of craft and use of [[stone tool]]s by [[Hominidae|hominid]]s appears in the current [[archaeological record]], until around 300,000 years ago, spanning the [[Oldowan]] ("mode 1") and [[Acheulean]] ("mode 2") [[lithic technology]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Early human (hominid) used [[stone tool]] technology, such as a [[hand axe]] that was [[Tool use by animals|similar to that used by primates]], which are found to have intelligence levels of modern children aged 3 to 5 years. Intelligence and use of technology did not change much for millions of years.

==== Middle Paleolithic ====
The [[Middle Paleolithic]] period occurred in Europe and the Near East, during which the [[Neanderthal]]s lived (c. 300,000–28,000 years ago). The earliest evidence ([[Mungo Man]]) of settlement in [[Australia]] dates [[History of Australia before 1901|to around 40,000 years ago]] when modern humans likely crossed from Asia by island-hopping.  The [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]] exhibit the earliest traces of human life in [[India]], some of which are approximately 30,000 years old.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!---- clarify this section, who, when and where ---&gt;

''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'', the only living [[species]] in the genus ''[[Homo]]'', originated in [[Africa]] about 200,000 years ago. As compared to their predecessors, ''Homo sapiens'' had greater mental capability and ability to walk erect, which provided freed hands for manipulating objects and far greater use of [[tool]]s.&lt;ref name=Sternberg&gt;Sternberg, Robert J.; Kaufman, Scott Barry.

==== Upper Paleolithic Revolution ====
During the [[Upper Paleolithic Revolution]], advancements in human intelligence and technology changed radically with the advent of [[Behavioral modernity]] between 60,000 and 30,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=Gabora328-342/&gt; [[Behavioral modernity]] is a set of traits that distinguish ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' from extinct [[hominid]] lineages.

Cultural aspects emerged, such as [[art of the Upper Paleolithic]] period, which included [[cave painting]], [[sculpture]] such as the [[Venus figurines]], carvings and engravings of bone and ivory.  The most common subject matter was large animals that were hunted by the people of the time.
The [[Cave of Altamira and Paleolithic Cave Art of Northern Spain]] and [[Côa Valley Paleolithic Art]] are examples of such artwork. [[Prehistoric music|Musical instruments]] such as [[Paleolithic flutes|flutes]] emerged during this period.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==== Mesolithic period ====
The Mesolithic period was a transitional era between the Paleolithic [[hunter-gatherer]]s, beginning with the [[Holocene]] warm period around 11,660 [[Before Present|BP]] and ending with the [[Neolithic Revolution|Neolithic]] introduction of farming, the date of which varied in each geographical region.

==== Neolithic Revolution ====
The [[Neolithic Revolution]] was the first agricultural revolution, representing a transition from [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] nomadic life to an [[agriculture]] existence.  It evolved independently in six separate locations worldwide circa 10,000–7000 years [[Before Present|BP]] (8,000–5,000 [[Before Christ|BC]]). The earliest known evidence exists in the tropical and subtropical areas of [[Southwest Asia|southwestern]]/[[southern Asia]], [[North Africa|northern]]/[[central Africa]] and [[Central America]].&lt;ref name=Gupta&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gupta | first1 = Anil | year = 2010 | title = Origin of agriculture and domestication of plants and animals linked to early Holocene climate amelioration | url = http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jul102004/54.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Current Science | volume = 87 | issue = | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some key defining characteristics. The [[Origins of agriculture|Introduction of agriculture]] resulted in a shift from nomadic to more sedentary lifestyles,&lt;ref name=Shaw422-423&gt;Ian Shaw, Robert Jameson. (2002). ''A Dictionary of Archaeology.'' Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. pp. 422-423.  {{ISBN|0-631-17423-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of agricultural tools such as the [[plough]], [[digging stick]] and [[hoe (tool)]] made agricultural labor more efficient.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Animals were [[Domestication|domesticated]], including [[Origin of the domestic dog|dogs]].&lt;ref name=Gupta/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaw422-423/&gt; Another defining characteristic of the period was the emergence of [[pottery]],&lt;ref name=Shaw422-423/&gt; and, in the late Neolithic period, the [[wheel]] was introduced for making pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Shaw, Robert Jameson. (2002). ''A Dictionary of Archaeology.'' Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. p. 125. {{ISBN|0-631-17423-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neolithic architecture]] included houses and villages built of [[mud-brick]] and [[wattle and daub]] and the construction of storage facilities, tombs and monuments.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Shaw, Robert Jameson.

=== Bronze Age ===
[[File:Sword bronze age (2nd version).jpg|thumb|200px|A late [[Bronze Age sword]] or dagger blade.]]
The Stone Age developed into the [[Bronze Age]] after the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. The Neolithic Revolution involved radical changes in agricultural technology which included [[History of agriculture|development of agriculture]], animal [[domestication]], and the adoption of permanent settlements.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The [[Bronze Age]] is characterised by metal [[smelting]] of [[copper]] and its alloy [[bronze]], an alloy of [[tin]] and copper, to create implements and weapons. Polished stone tools continued to be used due to their abundance compared with the less common metals (especially tin).{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

This technological trend apparently began in the [[Fertile Crescent]], and spread outward.

=== Iron Age ===
[[File:Axe of iron from Swedish Iron Age, found at Gotland, Sweden.jpg|thumb|left|100px|An [[axe]]head made of iron, dating from Swedish [[Iron Age]].]]
The [[Iron Age]] involved the adoption of iron or steel [[bloomery|smelting]] technology, either by [[casting]] or [[forging]]. Iron replaced bronze,&lt;ref name="Kipfer pp. 257-258"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Ann Kipfer|title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XneTstDbcC0C&amp;pg=PA257|accessdate=16 June 2013|year=2000|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-46158-3|pages=257–258}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TJEB"&gt;The Junior Encyclopædia Britannica: A reference library of general knowledge.

Muhly, eds. ''The Coming of the Age of Iron'' (New Haven, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; The best tools and weapons were made from steel.&lt;ref name=Spoerl&gt;Spoerl, Joseph S. [http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/h-carnegie-steel.htm ''A Brief History of Iron and Steel Production.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602031459/http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/h-carnegie-steel.htm |date=2010-06-02 }}. [[Saint Anselm College]]. Retrieved December 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other societal changes often accompanied the introduction of iron, including practice changes in art, religion and agriculture. The Iron Age ends with the beginning of the historic periods, generally marked by the [[History of writing|development of written language]] that enabled creation of [[Recorded history|historic record]]s.&lt;ref name="TJEB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Spoerl /&gt;

The timing of the adoption of iron depended upon "the availability of iron ore and the state of knowledge".&lt;ref name="Kipfer pp. 257-258" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TJEB" /&gt; Iron was smelted in Egypt about 6000 B.C. and iron replaced bronze in the Middle East about 1500 B.C. Chinese began casting iron about 5000 B.C. and their methods for casting iron was the precursor to modern steel manufacturing methods. Most of Asia, however, did not adopt production of iron until the historic period.&lt;ref name="Kipfer pp. 257-258" /&gt;

In Europe, iron was introduced about 1100 B.C. and had replaced bronze for creating weapons and tools by 500 B.C. They made iron through the forging smelting process and integrated casting in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Kipfer pp. 257-258" /&gt; Large [[hill fort]]s or [[oppida]] were built either as a refuge in time of war, or sometimes as permanent settlements. Agricultural practices were made more efficient with more effective and varied iron tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pamela Crabtree|title=Medieval Archaeology: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSW8eK6Dk1QC&amp;pg=PA264|accessdate=16 June 2013|date=12 October 2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-80181-9|pages=264–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, the Iron Age is the last prehistoric period and is followed by the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Crabtree2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pamela Crabtree|title=Medieval Archaeology: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSW8eK6Dk1QC&amp;pg=PA263|accessdate=16 June 2013|date=12 October 2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-80181-9|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iron was extracted from metal ore starting about 2000 B.C. in Africa.&lt;ref name="Kipfer pp. 257-258" /&gt;

== New World ==
{{main|Archaeology of the Americas}}
The New World periods began with the crossing of the [[Paleo-Indians]], [[Athabaskan language|Athabaskan]], [[Aleut]]s and [[Eskimo]]s along the [[Beringia|Bering Land Bridge]] onto the North American continent.&lt;ref&gt;Cassells, E. Steve. (1997). The Archaeology of Colorado, Revised Edition. Boulder, Colorado: Johnson Books. p. 13. {{ISBN|1-55566-193-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Paleo-Indians]]  were the first people who entered, and subsequently inhabited, the [[Americas]] during the final [[Quaternary glaciation|glacial episodes]] of the [[Late Pleistocene|late Pleistocene period]]. Evidence suggests big-game hunters crossed the [[Bering Strait]] from Asia into North America over a land and ice bridge ([[Beringia]]), that existed between 45,000 [[Common Era|BCE]] – 12,000 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;[https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/atlas.html?era=e003 "Atlas of the Human Journey-The Genographic Project."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501094643/https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/atlas.html?era=e003 |date=2011-05-01 }} National Geographic Society. 1996-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; following herds of large [[herbivores]] far into [[Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;Viegas, Jennifer.

In their book, ''Method and Theory in American Archaeology,'' Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips defined five cultural stages for the Americas, including the three prehistoric [[Lithic stage|Lithic]],  [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] and [[Formative stage]]s.  The historic stages are the [[Classic stage|Classic]] and [[Post-Classic stage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Willey, Gordon R. (1989). Glyn Edmund Daniel and Christopher Chippindale (eds.). ''The Pastmasters: Eleven Modern Pioneers of Archaeology.'' New York: Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-05051-1}}. OCLC 19750309.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cassells9/&gt;

=== Lithic ===
The [[Lithic technology|Lithic]] period occurred from 12,000 to 6,000 years before present and included the [[Clovis culture|Clovis]], [[Folsom tradition|Folsom]] and [[Plano culture]]s.&lt;ref name=Cassells9&gt;Cassells, E. Steve. (1997). ''The Archaeology of Colorado.'' (revised edition). Boulder: Johnson Books. p. 9. {{ISBN|9781-55566-193-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Clovis culture was considered the first culture to use projectile points to hunt on the North American continent. Since then, a [[Manis Mastodon Site|pre-Clovis site was found in Manis, Washington]] that found use of projectile points to hunt mastodons.&lt;ref&gt;Bhanoo, Sindya N. (October 20, 2011). [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/science/25mastodon.html "Big-Game Hunt Adds to Evidence of Early North American Settlement."] ''New York Times.'' Retrieved December 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archaic ===

The [[Archaic period in the Americas]] was dated from 8,000 to 2,000 years before present.&lt;ref name=Cassells9/&gt; People were hunters of small game, such as deer, antelope and rabbits, and gatherers of wild plants, moving seasonally to hunting and gathering sites.  Late in the Archaic period, about 200-500 A.D., corn was introduced into the diet and pottery-making became an occupation for storing and caring food.&lt;ref&gt;Kipfer, Barbara Ann. (2000). [https://books.google.com/books?id=XneTstDbcC0C&amp;pg=PA341 ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology.''] New York:Plenum Publisher. p. 341. {{ISBN|0-306-46158-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formative ===
The [[Formative stage]] followed the Archaic period in the Americas and continued until there was contact by European people. Some of the cultures from that period include that of the [[Ancient Pueblo People]], [[Mississippian culture]] and [[Olmec]] cultures.&lt;ref name=Cassells9/&gt;

Cultures of the Formative Stage are supposed to possess the technologies of pottery, weaving, and developed food production.  Social organization is supposed to involve permanent towns and villages, as well as the first ceremonial centers.  Ideologically, an early priestly class or theocracy is often present or in development.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon R. Willey and Philip Phillips (1957). ''Method and Theory in American Archaeology.''

'''RRS ''Ernest Shackleton''''' is a [[Royal Research Ship]] operated by the [[British Antarctic Survey]]. She is primarily a logistics ship used for the resupply of scientific stations in the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]].

==History==
Launched in 1995 as MV ''Polar Queen'' for [[GC Rieber Shipping]], she was operated in the Antarctic by other national programmes. The British Antarctic Survey acquired her on a long-term bareboat charter in August 1999 and renamed her RRS ''Ernest Shackleton'' after the [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] polar explorer [[Ernest Shackleton|Sir Ernest Shackleton]].&lt;ref name=bas&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/living_and_working/research_ships/rrs_ernest_shackleton/index.php| title=RRS ''Ernest Shackleton''| publisher=British Antarctic Survey| accessdate=2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She replaced [[RRS Bransfield|RRS ''Bransfield'']].  Known to users as the Shack, the ship was chartered to Crystal Cruise Line to escort its 68,000 ton liner Crystal Serenity through Canada's Northwest Passage in late August/September 2016.

==Construction==
RRS ''Ernest Shackleton'' is ice strengthened with a double hull construction and is capable of a wide range of logistic tasks as well as having a scientific capability. She has a cargo tender "Tula" on deck for ship to shore transfer of equipment when the ship cannot berth alongside.&lt;ref name=bas/&gt;

==Service==
RRS ''Ernest Shackleton'' is primarily a logistic ship, used for the resupply of the Survey's Antarctic research stations. She loads cargo and science equipment in the [[Humber]] and sails to the Antarctic in September/October each year, returning in May/June. After annual refit/drydock, ''Ernest Shackleton'' is chartered out for commercial use in the northern summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/living_and_working/research_ships/index.php| title=BAS Research Ships| publisher=[[British Antarctic Survey|BAS]]| accessdate=2007-08-30| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214050204/http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/living_and_working/research_ships/index.php| archivedate=14 December 2007| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifying the '''research question''' is the [[methodological]] point of departure of scholarly research in both the [[natural sciences|natural]] and [[social sciences]]. The research will answer the question posed. At an [[undergraduate]] level, the answer to the research question is the [[thesis statement]]. The answer to a research question will help address a "research problem" which is a problem "readers think is worth solving". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Booth|first=Wayne|title=[[The Craft of Research]]|year=1995|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=0226065650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Specifying the research question is one of the first [[Methodology|methodological]] steps the investigator has to take when undertaking [[research]]. The research question must be accurately and clearly defined.

Choosing a research question is the central element of both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research]] and in some cases it may precede construction of the conceptual framework of study. In all cases, it makes the theoretical assumptions in the framework more explicit, most of all it indicates what the researcher wants to know most and first.

The student or researcher then carries out the research necessary to answer the research question, whether this involves reading [[secondary sources]] over a few days for an [[undergraduate]] term paper or carrying out [[primary research]] over years for a major project.

When the research is complete and the researcher knows the (probable) answer to the research question, writing up can begin (as distinct from writing notes, which is a process that goes on through a research project). In term papers, the answer to the question is normally given in summary in the [[introduction (essay)|introduction]] in the form of a [[thesis statement]].

== Types and purpose ==
The research question serves two purposes:
# It determines where and what kind of research the writer will be looking for. 
# It identifies the specific objectives the study or paper will address. 
Therefore, the writer must first identify the type of study (qualitative, quantitative, or mixed) before the research question is developed.

=== Qualitative study ===
A [[qualitative research|qualitative study]] seeks to learn why or how, so the writer’s research must be directed at determining the what, why and how of the research topic. Therefore, when crafting a research question for a qualitative study, the writer will need to ask a why or how question about the topic. For example: How did the company successfully market its new product? The sources needed for qualitative research typically include print and internet texts (written words), audio and visual media.

Here is Creswell's (2009) example of a script for a qualitative research central question: 
* _________ (How or what) is the _________ ("story for" for narrative research; "meaning of" the phenomenon for phenomenology; "theory that explains the process of" for grounded theory; "culture-sharing pattern" for ethnography; "issue" in the "case" for case study) of _________ (central phenomenon) for _________ (participants) at _________ (research site).

=== Quantitative study ===
A [[quantitative research|quantitative study]] seeks to learn where, or when, so the writer’s research must be directed at determining the where, or when of the research topic. Therefore, when crafting a research question for a quantitative study, the writer will need to ask a where, or when question about the topic. For example: Where should the company market its new product? Unlike a qualitative study, a quantitative study is mathematical analysis of the research topic, so the writer’s research will consist of numbers and statistics.

Here is Creswell's (2009) example of a script for a quantitative  research question: 
* Does _________ (name the theory) explain the relationship between _________ (independent variable) and _________ (dependent variable), controlling for the effects of _________ (control variable)?

Alternatively, a script for a quantitative null hypothesis might be as follows: 
* There is no significant difference between _________ (the control and experimental groups on the independent variable) on _________ (dependent variable).

Quantitative studies also fall into two categories: 
# Correlational studies: A correlational study is non-experimental, requiring the writer to research relationships without manipulating or randomly selecting the subjects of the research. The research question for a correlational study may look like this: What is the relationship between long distance commuters and eating disorders?
# Experimental studies: An experimental study is experimental in that it requires the writer to manipulate and randomly select the subjects of the research. The research question for an experimental study may look like this: Does the consumption of fast food lead to eating disorders?

=== Mixed study ===
A mixed study integrates both [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] and quantitative studies, so the writer’s research must be directed at determining the why or how and the what, where, or when of the research topic. Therefore, the writer will need to craft a research question for each study required for the assignment. A typical study may be expected to have between 1 and 6 research questions.

Once the writer has determined the type of study to be used and the specific objectives the paper will address, the writer must also consider whether the research question passes the ‘so what’ test. The ‘so what’ test means that the writer must construct evidence to convince the audience why the research is expected to add new or useful knowledge to the literature.

==Related terms==

===Problematique===

"Problematique" is a term that functions analogously to the research problem or question used typically when addressing global systemic problems. The term achieved prominence in 1970 when 
[[Hasan Özbekhan]], [[Erich Jantsch]] and [[Alexander Christakis]] conceptualized the original prospectus of the [[Club of Rome]] titled "The Predicament of Mankind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunsite.utk.edu/FINS/loversofdemocracy/Predicament.PTI.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=3 February 2014|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203125912/http://sunsite.utk.edu/FINS/loversofdemocracy/Predicament.PTI.pdf|archivedate=3 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this prospectus the authors designated 49 Continuous Critical Problems facing humankind, saying "We find it virtually impossible to view them as problems that exist in isolation - or as problems capable of being solved in their own terms... It is this generalized meta system of problems, which we call the 'problematique' that inheres in our situation."

Situations similar to the global problematique in their complexity are also called problematiques. These situations receive different designations from other authors. [[C. West Churchman]], [[Rittell]] and Weber, and [[Argyris]] &lt;ref&gt;Argyris, C. (1968) "Some Unintended Consequences of Rigorous Research". ''Psychological Bulletin'', pp.&amp;nbsp;185–197.&lt;/ref&gt; call these situations wicked problems. Russell Ackoff simply called them "messes.'"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63507">{{short description|The use of diving techniques in the pursuit of scientific knowledge}}
[[File:Scale drawing underwater.jpg|thumb|right|A scientific diver at work]]
'''Scientific diving''' is the use of [[underwater diving]] techniques by scientists to perform work underwater in the direct pursuit of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="CoP Scientific" /&gt; The legal definition of scientific diving varies by jurisdiction. Scientific divers are normally qualified scientists first and divers second, who use diving equipment and techniques as their way to get to the location of their fieldwork. The direct observation and manipulation of marine habitats afforded to scuba-equipped scientists have transformed the marine sciences generally, and [[marine biology]] and [[marine chemistry]] in particular.&lt;ref name=RaD-Witman /&gt; [[Underwater archeology]] and [[geology]] are other examples of sciences pursued underwater. Some scientific diving is carried out by universities in support of undergraduate or postgraduate research programs, and government bodies such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and the UK [[Environment Agency]] carry out scientific diving to recover samples of water, marine organisms and sea, lake or [[Stream bed|riverbed]] material to examine for signs of pollution.

Equipment used varies widely in this field, and is generally selected based on cost, effectiveness, availability and risk factors. Open-circuit scuba is most often used as it is widely available and cost-effective, and is the entry level training mode in most places.

Scientific diving in the course of employment may be regulated by occupational safety legislation, or may be exempted as self-regulated by a recognised body. The safety record has generally been good. Collection of scientific data by volunteers outside of employment is generally considered to legally be recreational diving.

Training standards vary throughout the world, and are generally higher than for entry level recreational diving, and in some cases identical to commercial diver training. There are a few international agreements that facilitate scientists from different places working together on projects of common interest, by recognising mutually acceptable minimum levels of competence.

== Scope of work ==
Scientific diving is any diving undertaken in the support of [[science]], so activities are widely varied and may include visual counts and measurements of organisms in situ, collection of samples, surveys, photography, videography, video mosaicing, benthic coring, coral coring, placement, maintenance and retrieval of [[scientific equipment]].&lt;ref name="ADAS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SDSC" /&gt;

=== Contribution of scientific diving to research ===
Underwater diving interventions, particularly on scuba, provide the capacity for scientists to make direct observations on site and in real time, which allow for ground-truthing of larger scale observations and occasional serendipitous observations outside the planned experiment. Human dexterity remains less expensive and more adaptable to unexpected complexities in experimental setup than remotely operated and robotic alternatives in the shallower depth ranges. Scuba has also provided insights which would be unlikely to occur without direct observation, where hypotheses produced by deductive reasoning have not predicted interactive and behavioural characteristics of marine organisms, and these would not be likely to be detected from remote sensing or video or other methods which do not provide the full context and detail available to the diver. Scuba allows the scientist to set up the experiment and be present to observe unforeseen alternatives to the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=RaD-Witman /&gt;

The field of global change biology includes investigation of evidence relating to global warming and ocean acidification. Many of the measurable changes in global climate occur in the sea. Coral bleaching is an example of an indicator of change, and scuba diving has provided a large amount of low-impact observational data contributing significantly to the large body of knowledge on the subject over several decades.&lt;ref name="ESDP Tchernov" /&gt;

The field of ocean acidification and the impact of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emission has seen similar growth and most of the cited articles in this field have relied to a significant extent on data collected during scuba diving operations.&lt;ref name="ESDP Tchernov" /&gt;

The field of paleoclimate reconstruction has a major influence on the understanding of evolution and the ecological and biogeographic past, as climate is the most powerful driver of evolution. Coring corals on a reef in the least harmful and focused manner is currently most practicable using scuba technology. This mining of the past makes it possible to attempt to predict future climate.&lt;ref name="ESDP Tchernov" /&gt;

Advances in training and accessibility to trimix diving and closed circuit rebreather systems has enabled scientific divers to reach highly diverse deeper mesophotic reefs which may be the corals last refuge from the warming of surface waters.&lt;ref name="ESDP Tchernov" /&gt;

The current knowledge of the functioning of the ecologically and economically important hard-bottom communities in the shallow water coastal zones is both limited and particularly difficult to study due to poor accessibility for surface operated instrumentation as a result of topographic and structural complexity which inhibit remote sampling of orgnisms in the benthic boundary layer. In situ assessments by scientific divers remain the most flexible tool for exploring this habitat and allow precise and optimised location of instruments.&lt;ref name="ESDP van Duyl" /&gt;

The capacity to dive under polar ice provides an opportunity to advance science in a restricted environment
at relatively low cost.  A small number of holes in the ice can provide access over a large area and high levels of experimental replication. Divers are a flexible and reliable method for deploying, maintaining and retrieving  equipment from under‐ice environments, and are relatively cost efficient for researching remote locations that, would otherwise require the use of more expensive research vessels.&lt;ref name="ESDP Sayer and Fischer" /&gt;

The global threat to marine ecosystems due to over‐exploitation, habitat loss, pollution and climate change is exacerbated by introduction of alien species, which is considered to be one of the leading causes of extinctions and biodiversity loss. Scientific divers are the most competent to detect the presence of potentially invasive species and in some cases can provide a quick response. Monitoring the effectiveness of response also requires diver intervention.&lt;ref name="ESDP Fontes" /&gt;

=== Modes of diving ===
Scientific diving may use any [[Underwater diving#Modes of diving|mode of diving]] that is best suited to the project. Scientific diving operations may use amd have used [[freediving]], [[scuba diving|scuba open circuit]], [[rebreather diving|scuba closed circuit]], surface oriented [[Surface-supplied diving|surface-supplied systems]], [[saturation diving]] from surface or [[underwater habitat]]s, [[atmospheric suit diving]] or [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s. [[Breathing gases]] used include air, [[oxygen]], [[nitrox]], [[Trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]], [[heliox]] and experimental mixtures.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 2001" /&gt;

===Citizen science===
Several citizen science projects use observational input from recreational divers to provide reliable data on presence and distribution of marine organisms. The ready availability of digital underwater cameras makes collection of such observations easy and the permanence of the record allows peer and expert review. Such projects include the Australian-based [[Reef Life Survey]], and the more international [[iNaturalist]] project, based in California, which is only partly focused on marine species.

==Management and control of scientific diving operations==
Scientific diving operations which are part of the work of an organisation are generally under the control of a diving supervisor or equivalent, and follow procedures similar to other professional diving operations.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt;

A scientific diving operation which follows the usual procedures of a commercial scuba operation will include one or more working divers, a stand-by diver and a supervisor, who will manage the operation from the surface control point. If the divers are tethered, there will generally be a line tender for each tethered diver in the water The stand-by diver may remain out of the water at the surface or may accompany the working diver or divers in the water. Surface supplied and saturation operations will also generally follow standard procedures used by commercial divers.&lt;ref name="CoP Scientific" /&gt;

The American system has a Diving Control Board taking overall responsibility for all scientific diving work done by an organisation. The Diving Officer is responsible to the board for operational, diving and safety matters.
For each dive, one scientist, designated as the Lead Diver, must be present at the site during that entire operation, and is responsible for management of the dive, including dive planning, briefing, emergency planning, equipment and procedures. The divers operate in a strict [[buddy diving]] system.&lt;ref name="Lang 2005" /&gt;

==Standard and emergency diving procedures==
{{see also|Scuba skills|Surface-supplied diving skills}}
The standard procedures for scuba and surface supplied diving are essentially the same as for any other similar diving operation using similar equipment in a similar environment, by both recreational, technical and other professional divers. There are a few special cases where scientific diving operations are carried out in places where other divers would generally not go, such as [[blue-water diving]].&lt;ref name="Haddock and Heine" /&gt; Scientific dives tend to be more task oriented than recreational dives, as the scientist is primarily there to gather data, and the diving is of secondary importance, as the way to get to the worksite.

The requirements for qualification as a scientific diver vary with jurisdiction. The European Scientific Diver (ESD) standard is reasonably representative:

Basic skills and underlying knowledge must include:&lt;ref name="ESD standards" /&gt;
* The fundamental [[Diving physics|physics]] and [[physiology of diving]], including the causes of [[Diving disorders|diving related disorders]] and illnesses and their effects and management.
* The specific problems associated with diving, including [[Scuba gas planning|calculations of breathing gas requirements]] and the correct use of [[decompression tables]].
* Correct selection, safe use and user maintenance of appropriate [[open circuit scuba]] diving equipment, including personal [[dive computer]]s.
* Basic diving skills and standard [[Scuba skills|scuba diving procedures]]
* Tending a tethered diver from the surface.
* The principles of [[dive planning]].
* The [[Legal aspects of diving|legal aspects]] and responsibilities relevant to working as a member of a scientific diving team.

Emergency skills include competence in:&lt;ref name="ESD standards" /&gt;
* Diving [[first aid]], including [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) and [[Oxygen therapy|oxygen administration]] to diving casualties.
* Standard emergency procedures and diving casualty management.
* [[Diver rescue|Scuba rescue]] techniques and management of casualties in and under the water.

==Working procedures common to scientific diving==

The requirements for qualification as a scientific diver vary with jurisdiction. The European Scientific Diver (ESD) standard is reasonably representative:

Competence in work methods common to scientific projects:&lt;ref name="ESD standards" /&gt;
* [[Underwater searches|Underwater search methods]].
* Survey methods suitable for accurately locating and marking objects and sites.
* The use of [[lifting bag]]s for controlled lifts, and [[airlift]]s for excavations and sampling.
* Basic [[rigging]] and rope work, including the assembly and deployment of [[transects]] and search patterns.
* [[Diver navigation]] methods.
* Recording methods.
* Sampling techniques appropriate to the scientific discipline.

===Underwater navigation===
[[File:Cave diver running a reel.jpg|thumb|right|A cave diver running a distance line into the overhead environment to facilitate a safe exit]]
{{main|Diver navigation}}
Underwater navigation by divers is broadly split into three categories.  ''Natural navigation'' techniques, and ''orienteering'', which is navigation focused upon the use of an underwater [[compass|magnetic compass]].&lt;ref name=Cumming2011 /&gt; and following a guideline.

Natural navigation, sometimes known as [[pilotage]], involves orienting by naturally observable phenomena, such as sunlight, water movement, bottom composition (for example, sand ripples run parallel to the direction of the wave front, which tends to run parallel to the shore), bottom contour and noise.  Although natural navigation is taught on courses, developing the skills is generally more a matter of experience.&lt;ref name=UKDivers /&gt;

Orienteering, or compass navigation, is a matter of training, practice and familiarity with the use of underwater compasses, combined with various techniques for reckoning distance underwater, including kick cycles (one complete upward and downward sweep of a kick), time, air consumption and occasionally by actual measurement. Kick cycles depend on the diver's finning technique and equipment, but are generally more reliable than time, which is critically dependent on speed, or air consumption, which is critically dependent on depth, work rate, diver fitness, and equipment drag. Techniques for direct measurement also vary, from the use of calibrated distance lines or surveyor's tape measures, to a mechanism like an [[impeller log]], to pacing off the distance along the bottom with the arms.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

Skilled underwater navigators use techniques from both of these categories in a seamless combination, using the compass to navigate between landmarks over longer distances and in poor visibility, while making use of the generic oceanographic indicators to help stay on course and as a check that there is no mistake with the bearing, and then recognising landmarks and using them with the remembered topography of a familiar site to confirm position.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

Guidelines, also known as cave lines, [[distance line]]s, penetration lines and jackstays are permanent or temporary lines laid by divers to mark a route, particularly in caves, wrecks and other areas where the way out from an overhead environment may not be obvious.&lt;ref name="Exley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guideline 2" /&gt; Guidelines are also useful in the event of [[silt out]].&lt;ref name="Guideline 3" /&gt;

Distance lines are wound on to a spool or a [[reel]].&lt;ref name="Guideline 1" /&gt; The length of the distance line used is dependent on the plan for the dive. Reels for distance lines may have a locking mechanism, ratchet or adjustable drag to control deployment of the line and a winding handle to help keep slack line under control and rewind line. The material used for any given distance line will vary based on intended use.&lt;ref name="Guideline 1"/&gt;  The use of guideline for navigation requires careful attention to laying and securing the line, line following, marking, referencing, positioning, teamwork, and communication.&lt;ref name="Guideline 3"/&gt;

A transect line is a special case of a guideline commonly used in scientific diving. It is a line laid to guide the diver on a survey along the line. In cases where position along the line must be accurately specified, a surveyor's tape or chain may be used as the transect line.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 1979" /&gt;

===Searches===
{{main|Underwater searches}}
[[File:US Navy 100708-N-4776G-203 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician 3rd Class Jonathan Sokol conducts training on a AN-PQS 2A hand held sonar.jpg|thumb|US Navy diver training in the use of a hand held sonar device]]
Searches are often required to find the subject of study, or to recover previously placed instrumentation. There are a number of techniques in general use. Some of these are suitable for scuba, and some for surface supplied diving. The choice of search technique will depend on logistical factors, terrain, protocol and diver skills.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 1979" /&gt;

As a general principle, a search method attempts to provide 100% coverage of the search area. this is greatly influenced by the width of the sweep. In conditions of zero visibility this is as far as the diver can feel with his hands while proceeding along the pattern. When visibility is better, it depends on the distance at which the target can be seen from the pattern. In all cases then, the pattern should be accurate and completely cover the search area without excessive redundancy or missed areas. Overlap is needed to compensate for inaccuracy, and may be necessary to avoid gaps in some patterns.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 1979" /&gt; Common search patterns include:
*[[Underwater searches#Circular search|Circular search]] – a diver swims at a series of distances (radii) around a fixed reference point. The circular search is simple and requires little equipment. It is useful where the position of the objects of the search is known with reasonable accuracy.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 1979" /&gt;
*Pendulum searches – a variation on the circular search where the diver stops and changes direction at the end of each arc.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 1979" /&gt;
*[[Underwater searches#Jackstay search|Jackstay search]] – divers swim along a search line - the jackstay, while searching to the sides. There are various techniques for performing a jackstay search.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 1979" /&gt;
*[[Underwater searches#Search patterns controlled by compass directions|Compass searches]] – search patterns controlled by compass directions.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 1979" /&gt;
*[[Underwater searches#Towed searches|Towed searches]] – divers are towed behind a boat while searching visually.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 1979" /&gt;
*[[Underwater searches#Searches using hand held submersible sonar transponders|Sonar assisted searches]] – Divers search using a sonar transponder. Active transponders that emit a signal and measure the return signal strength to determine obstructions in a given direction, or passive transponders which measure a signal emitted by the target can be used.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 1979" /&gt;

===Collection, sampling, tagging and recording===
Most scientific fieldwork involves some form of data collection. In some cases it is on-site measurement of physical data, and sometimes it involves taking samples, usually recording the circumstances in some detail. Video, still photography and manual listing of measurements and labeling of specimens are common practice.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 2001" /&gt; Biological and geological specimens are usually bagged and labelled for positive identification, and the availability of underwater cameras allows in-situ and bagged photographs to be taken for reference Biologica specimens may also be tagged an released, or have small biopsies taken for DNA analysis. When non-extractive measurements are made, video and still photography provide backup for listed data. Recording on prepared sheets is preferred where practicable as writing underwater is relatively inefficient, and often not very legible. Waterproof paper on a clipboard or a waterproof slate are commonly used for written records. Ordinary graphite pencils work fairly well underwater, though the wood tends to split after a while.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 1979" /&gt;

===Surveys, measurement and mapping===
Types of survey:
*{{annotated link|Census}}
*{{annotated link|Quadrat}}&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 1979" /&gt;
*{{annotated link|Transect}}&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 1979" /&gt;
*{{annotated link|Photographic surveys}}&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 1979" /&gt;
*{{annotated link|Geological survey}} – measurement of [[strike and dip]], classification of [[facies]].&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 1979" /&gt; 
*Measurement of profiles of reef and sand, [[Rugosity]].&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 1979" /&gt;
*{{annotated link|Bathymetric survey}}&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 1979" /&gt;
*{{annotated link|Archaeological site survey}}s&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 1979" /&gt;
[[Cartography|Mapping]] of an underwater site may be necessary for analysis of the data. Several methods are available. A [[map]] is the two or three dimensional representation of geographic survey data following a standardised format, often using symbols representations of data, and often to a specified scale.

==Risk and safety==
Generally relatively low risk and good safety record overall, the vast majority of dives are relatively shallow and in reasonably good conditions. Most scientific dives can be deferred when conditions are sub-optimal, and seldom require the use of dangerous equipment. This has allowed a good safety record in spite of relatively relaxed equipment and training requirements for occupational diving.&lt;ref name="Drew1991" /&gt;

The earliest scientific diving safety programme in the US was established at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1954, about 5 years before the development of the national recreational scuba training agencies. Most American scientific diving programmes are based on elements of the original Scripps diving programme.&lt;ref name="Lang 2005" /&gt;

===Safety record===

A survey of some half a million scientific dives reported 7 fatalities and 21 cases of decompression illmess. These rates are lower than those previously reported for military personnel, recreational divers in the UK, recreational divers in the Caribbean, recreational divers in western Canada and wreck divers in cold water.&lt;ref name="Sayer 2005" /&gt;

Nitrox has been used for open circuit scientific diving since the early 1970s with no evidence of increased DCS risk in comparison with similar air dives.&lt;ref name="Lang 2005" /&gt;

A maximum oxygen partial pressure of 1.6 bar has been found generally acceptable for open circuit nitrox diving by the scientific community, and it has not been found necessary to screen for carbon dioxide retention.&lt;ref name="Lang 2005" /&gt;

Investigation of the order of dive profiles has shown no statistical increase of decompression sickness risk in reverse profile diving. No validity was found for the rule of diving progressively shallower in successive no-decompression dives imposed by recreational diver training organisations.&lt;ref name="Lang 2005" /&gt;

As of 1992 the prevalence of decompression illness in the United States was estimated at one case per 100,000
dives for the scientific diving community. This may be compared with approximately one case per 1000 dives for commercial diving and one case per 5000 dives for recreational diving.&lt;ref name="Lang 2005" /&gt; The reported decompression sickness rate of 1:100,000 over 50 years appears to be acceptable to the scientific diving community. Diving profiles resemble recreational diving more than other sectors, but the incident rate in scientific diving is an order of magnitude lower than for recreational diving. This has been attributed to more thorough entry-level and continued training, better supervision and operational procedures and medical and fitness screening.&lt;ref name="Lang 2005" /&gt;

==Demographics==
In the United States scientific diving is done by research institutions, universities, museums, aquaria, and consulting companies for purposes of research, education and environmental monitoring. As of 2005 there were an estimated 4000 scientific divers, of which a small number are career scientific divers, with an average age of around 40 years, and a larger number of students in the 18 to 34 year age group. There is no specific upper age limit providing the diver remains medically fit to dive. The lower limit is determined by the age of students qualifying for training. About a quarter are female.&lt;ref name="Lang 2005" /&gt;

==Regulation of scientific diving==
Scientific diving is generally considered to be occupational diving, and is usually regulated as such except where specifically exempted.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewett 2001a" /&gt;

===Exemptions===
In the US, scientific diving is exempted from the requirements of the Federal Occupational Safety and Heath regulations, provided that it complies with the requirements specified for the exemption.&lt;ref name="OSHA guidelines" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hicks 1997" /&gt;

==Training and registration of scientific divers==

When a scientific diving operation is part of the duties of the diver as an employee, the operation may be considered a professional diving operation subject to regulation as such. In these cases the training and registration may follow the same requirements as for other professional divers, or may include training standards specifically intended for scientific diving. In other cases, where the divers are in full control of their own diving operation, including planning and safety, diving as volunteers, the occupational health and safety regulations may not apply.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CoP Scientific" /&gt;

Where scientific diving is exempt from commercial diving regulation, training requirements may differ considerably, and in some cases basic scientific diver training and certification may not differ much from entry level recreational diver training.

Technological advances have made it possible for scientific divers to accomplish more on a dive, but they have also increased the complexity and the task loading of both the diving equipment and the work done, and consequently require higher levels of trainng and preparation to safely and effectively use this technology. It is preferable for effective learning and safety that such specialisation training is done systematically and under controlled conditions, rather than on site and on the job. Environmental conditions for training should include exercises in conditions as close as reasonably practicable to field conditions.&lt;ref name="Somers 1987a" /&gt;

==International variations and cooperation==

===Australia===
Although the first scientific diving expedition in [[Australia]] was carried out by Sir [[Maurice Yonge]] to the [[Great Barrier Reef]] in 1928, most scientific diving did not start until 1952 when the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] began work to understand the [[pearl]] beds of northern Australia in 1957.&lt;ref name=Drew1991 /&gt;
Commercial divers worked under Australian Standard CZ18 "Work in Compressed Air" in 1972. This standard applied to [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] workers and divers so the underwater work was drafted into AS 2299 "Underwater Air Breathing Operations" in 1979. In 1987, a re-write of AS 2299 included scientific diving in the regulations even though the divers had been self-regulating under the Australian Marine Sciences Association (AMSA). At that time, the AMSA and the Australian Institute for Maritime Archaeology (AIMA) began a collaboration to draft a new standard for scientific diving.&lt;ref name=Drew1991/&gt;

===Germany===
In the 1960s there were no regulations for scientific diving in Germany, but two fatal accidents in 1969 led to the implementation of guidelines for scientific diving based on the commercial diving guidelines. These define the equipment, training, protocols and legal background for scientific diving for German universities, research institutes and government organisations. Divers trained to these requirements are mostly science students or technicians, and are subsequently registered as scientific divers.&lt;ref name="Jewett 2001a" /&gt;

Scientific diving is done  by a tethered diver in the water, monitored by a dive tender at the surface, controlled by a dive operation leader (supervisor) and with a standby diver on site. Diving equipment includes full-face mask and dry suit, but a buoyancy control device is not obligatory. Most dives do not require decompression stops.&lt;ref name="Jewett 2001a" /&gt;

===South Africa===
In [[South Africa]], scientific diving is considered a form of commercial diving and is within the scope of the Diving Regulations 2009 and the Code of Practice for Scientific Diving published by the Chief Inspector of the department of Labour,&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt; Under DR 2009 the Codes of Practice are guidance and not compulsory practice. They are provided as recommended good practice, and in theory need not be followed providing an acceptable level of safety is achieved in terms of the Occupational Health and Safety Act #85 of 1993. However, in this case the onus is on the diving contractor to ensure acceptable safety during the diving operation based on risk assessment. The level of safety required is specified in the OHS act as "reasonably practicable" taking into account a number of factors, including cost effectiveness, availability of technology for mitigation and available knowledge of hazards. Use of the relatively flexible scientific code rather than the default Code of Practice for Inshore Diving is restricted to clients which are registered as organisations engaged in either scientific research or higher education.&lt;ref name="CoP Scientific" /&gt;

The qualification required to dive at work in South Africa is linked to the mode of diving, the equipment to be used, and the diving environment. There are six classes of occupational diver registration, all of which may be employed in scientific diving operations within the scope of the specified competence and when supported by the required infrastructure.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt;
*Class 1 divers are competent to do saturation dives.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt;
*Class 2 divers are competent to do surface orientated open bell dives to a maximum depth of 70&amp;nbsp;msw.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt;
*Class 3 divers are competent to do surface supplied dives to a maximum depth of 50&amp;nbsp;msw.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt;
*Class 4 divers are competent to do open circuit scuba dives to a maximum depth of 30&amp;nbsp;msw.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt;
*Class 5 divers are competent to do open circuit scuba dives for scientific work to a maximum depth of 20&amp;nbsp;msw.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt;
*Class 6 divers are competent to do open circuit scuba dives in a benign environment to a maximum depth of 8&amp;nbsp;msw.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt;
In each of these classes, the fundamental diving competences include those of the class with the next higher number, though specialist skills may differ from person to person and may have no obvious connection to the registered class.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt;

Most scientific diving in South Africa is done on open circuit scuba by Class 4 and 5 divers as no-stop dives on air or nitrox. The Code of Practice allows for the use of alternative modes and technologies provided appropriate competence is achieved by training and assessment, and the risk of the project is assessed as acceptable by both the organisation and the members of the diving team.&lt;ref name="CoP Scientific" /&gt;

===United Kingdom===
As diving is an activity that is considered to put the diver at a higher than normal risk to health, in the UK all diving at work, including scientific diving, is regulated through the Diving at Work Regulations, 1997 and the associated approved codes of practice, which are implemented by the [[Health and Safety Executive]]. The code of practice for scientific diving also covers archaeological diving and diving in public aquariums. The professional body representing the scientific and archaeological diving sector is the [[Scientific Diving Supervisory Committee]] (SDSC), and it is responsible to the [[Natural Environment Research Council]]&lt;ref name="what is SDSC" /&gt;

The determining factors indicating that a person is diving at work, and therefore are subject to the regulations, are:
*The diving is done as part of the person's work – they are paid to do it, ''or''
*If diving out of working hours, or as a student or volunteer, the data obtained from the diving activity goes towards publication with some academic or financial value ''and''
* The diving operation is within UK territorial waters.
HSE regulations are only enforceable within UK waters, but operations from UK registered merchant vessels  may also require adherence to the regulations and codes of practice.

Undergraduate students and volunteers are generally not regarded as being at work, but if diving as part of an organised event or programme, the diving contractor will still have a duty of care. Postgraduate students are more likely to be considered at work when the diving is a significant part of their research.&lt;ref name="diving at work" /&gt;

===United States===
In the United States scientific diving is permitted by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] to operate under an alternative consensual standard of practice that is maintained by the [[American Academy of Underwater Sciences]].&lt;ref name="Hicks 1997" /&gt;

29 CFR Part 1910 - Subpart T "Commercial Diving Operations," establishes mandatory occupational safety and health requirements for commercial diving operations which apply wherever OSHA has statutory jurisdiction. This covers the inland and coastal territorial watrs of the United States and possessions. 
&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;

The United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America petitioned the Federal Government in 1975 to issue an emergency temporary standard covering all professional diving operations, which was issued on June 15, 1976, to be effective from July 15, 1976. This was challenged in the US Court of Appeals and was withdrawn in November 1976. A permanent standard for commercial diving was subsequently formulated which became effective from October 20, 1977. The American Academy for Underwater Science applied for an exemption for scientific diving, citing 20 years of self-regulation and a lower accident rate than the commercial diving industry. An exemption was issued effective from November 28, 1982, after negotiation.&lt;ref name="AAUS Exemption" /&gt;

To be able to avail itself of the Scientific Diving Exemption the institution under whose auspices the work is carried out must meet four tests:
# The Diving Control Board consisting of a majority of active scientific divers must have autonomous and absolute authority over the scientific diving program's operations.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OSHA 1910.410 App B" /&gt;
# The purpose of all projects using scientific diving is the advancement of science; therefore, information and data resulting from the project are non-proprietary.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OSHA 1910.410 App B" /&gt;
# The tasks of a scientific diver are those of an observer and data gatherer. Construction and trouble-shooting tasks traditionally associated with commercial diving are not included within scientific diving.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OSHA 1910.410 App B" /&gt;
# Scientific divers, based on the nature of their activities, must use scientific expertise in studying the underwater environment and, therefore, are scientists or scientists in training.&lt;ref name="OSHA guidelines" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;

The AAUS promulgates and regularly reviews the consensus based Standards for Scientific Diving Certification and Operation of Scientific Diving Programs, which is a guideline for scientific diving programs in the US, and also used in some other countries. this document is currently the "Standard" of the scientific diving community and must be followed by all organizational members, these standards allow for reciprocity between institutions, and are widely used throughout the United States and some foreign countries.&lt;ref name="AAUS Exemption" /&gt;

The AAUS uses three levels of scientific diver authorisation:
*Diver-in-Training signifies that the diver has completed entry-level training requirements through a recognised recreational scuba certification agency or scientific diving programme.&lt;ref name="Lang 2005" /&gt;
*Scientific Diver certification is a permit to dive using compressed air within no-decompression limits.&lt;ref name="Lang 2005" /&gt;
*Temporary Diver authorisation is issued following a demonstration of the required competence and if the person  can contribute significantly to a planned dive. It is valid only for a specific operation and is subject to the standard policies, regulations and standards.&lt;ref name="Lang 2005" /&gt;

There are also depth limitations which may be incrementally increased based on satisfactory experience, for 9&amp;nbsp;msw, 18&amp;nbsp;msw, 30&amp;nbsp;msw, 40&amp;nbsp;msw 45&amp;nbsp;msw and 58&amp;nbsp;msw. A range of specialty qualifications may follow additional training and assessment. These are: decompression diving, surface-supplied diving, mixed-gas diving, nitrox diving, rebreather diving, lock-out and saturation diving, blue-water diving, drysuit diving,
overhead environment diving, altitude diving, and use of dive computers for decompression monitoring.&lt;ref name="Lang 2005" /&gt;

===International scientific cooperation===
Various methods may be used to allow for international recognition of scientific divers, allowing them to work together on projects. In some cases the professional diver qualifications may be mutually recognised between countries,&lt;!--IDRF, CMAS?--&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} and in other cases the exemption allows the controlling bodies to make the necessary arrangements.&lt;!--US? Australia?--&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

====Europe====
The European Scientific Diving Panel (ESDP) is the European platform for the advancement of underwater scientific excellence and to promote and provide a practical support framework for scientific diving at a European scale. The ESDP was initiated in 2008 as a European Marine Board Panel (until April 2017) and currently is receiving organizational support from the European network of Marine Stations (MARS).
Official website of the European Scientific Diving Panel (ESDP): http://ssd.imbe.fr/?lang=en

Two levels of scientific diver registration are recognised. These represent the minimum level of training and competence required to allow scientists to participate freely throughout the countries of the European Union in underwater research projects diving using scuba. Certification or registration by an authorized national agency is a prerequisite, and depth and breathing gas limitations may  apply.&lt;ref name="ESD" /&gt;
*The {{annotated link|European Scientific Diver|abbreviation=ESD}} – A diver competent to perform as a member of a scientific diving team.&lt;ref name="ESD standards" /&gt;
*The {{annotated link|Advanced European Scientific Diver|abbreviation=AESD}} – A diver competent to organise a scientific diving team.&lt;ref name="ESD standards" /&gt;
This competence may be gained either through a formal training program, by in the field training and experience under appropriate supervision, or by a combination of these methods.&lt;ref name="ESD standards" /&gt; These standards specify the minimum basic training and competence for scientific divers, and do not consider any speciality skill requirements by employers. Further training for job-specific competence is additional to the basic competence implied by the registration.&lt;ref name="ESD standards" /&gt;

All member countries of the European Union are expected in terms of directive EEC 92/51 to recognise
one or both of these training levels. An applicant who satisfies the requirements will be issued with either an ESD or an AESD certificate that is valid for five years, and must be renewed every five years by application to the issuing authority. The certificate holders must comply with all national and local rules regarding medical fitness, workplace safety, insurance, and  limitations on scientific diving activities when engaged in scientific diving in a host member country. The certificate only indicates previously assessed competence to the training level, and not the current level of competence.&lt;ref name="ESD standards" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6809">'''''Soapbox Science''''' is a public outreach platform that promotes women working in science and the research that they do. The events turns public spaces into an area for learning and debate, in the spirit of Hyde Park's [[Speakers' Corner|Speaker's Corner]]. Soapbox Science encourages scientists to explain their research to members of the public using non-traditional methods (for example, there is no use of a projector or slides).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2016/feb/15/where-to-get-your-science-fix|title=Where to get your science fix|last=Gjersoe|first=Nathalia|date=2016-02-15|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers typically make props at home to explain the processes behind their research.

The '''taxome''' is the sum of all the described [[species]] and higher groups such as [[genus|genera]], [[family (biology)|families]], [[phylum|phyla]] of all life, or the sum of all valid [[taxa]].  The documenting of all this [[biodiversity]] is still very incomplete.

Many organisms have already been documented (it is guessed that around 1-2 million species have been described &amp;mdash; see Species Inventory in [[biodiversity]] article), but probably around nine-tenths of existing species have never been described, and those that have been described may have been redescribed, many times, under different names.  Thus, the state of the science of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] (the systematic organization of life) is somewhat confused.

The system of Linnean nomenclature (named after the 18th century [[Swedish people|Swedish]] pioneer [[Carl Linnaeus]]) is such that, in principle, the correct scientific name of all organisms described could be adjudicated, by means of historical priority.  However, the names of many organisms are published in such obscure books and journals that very little of this information is available to most people.  Thus, not only do we have little idea how many species there are, but we are even ignorant of the number of supposedly known species that have been described.

However, the situation is not as bad as it is sometimes painted.  The sum total of all existing taxonomic and nomenclatural documentation of living things is not large by today's data-rich standards.  We know where the books and journals are where species might have been described.  We simply need to put in the work to make the text and graphics of species descriptions available in [[database]]s, particularly electronic databases.  In many groups, species are poorly known, but it is now rare to discover a major undetected phylum or family, so coverage of the kinds of diversity of life is probably good, even if all species are not described.  Most of the undiscovered groups are probably reasonably closely related to something we have described.  Thus if we could document the existing knowledge, we would have a useful, albeit somewhat pixellated map of the diversity of life.

Just as a sequenced [[genome]] of an organism is a map of its [[DNA]], a database documenting the complete taxome would form a map of the described biodiversity of the entire planet.  Existing projects are mapping the positions of moons, planets and stars in the universe, as well as the physical geography of our own planet, and the genomes of selected organisms.  Projects are now being set up to take advantage of information technology to document and make available the entire body of taxonomy on line.  When this information becomes more complete, it should be possible to link this taxome information to all other information about biology.

'''''TIHKAL: The Continuation''''' is a 1997 book written by [[Alexander Shulgin]] and [[Ann Shulgin]] about a family of [[psychoactive drug]]s known as [[tryptamine]]s. A sequel to ''[[PIHKAL|PIHKAL: A Chemical Love Story]]'', ''TIHKAL'' is an [[acronym]] that stands for "Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved."

==Content==
''TIHKAL'', much like its predecessor ''PIHKAL'', is divided into two parts. The first part, for which all rights are reserved, begins with a fictionalized autobiography, picking up where the similar section of ''PIHKAL'' left off; it then continues with a collection of essays on topics ranging from [[psychotherapy]] and the [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] mind to the prevalence of [[dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] in nature, [[ayahuasca]] and the [[War on Drugs]]. The second part of ''TIHKAL'', which may be conditionally distributed for non-commercial reproduction (see [[#External links|external links]] below), is a detailed synthesis manual for 55 psychedelic compounds (many discovered by Alexander Shulgin himself), including their chemical structures, dosage recommendations, and qualitative comments. Shulgin has made the second part freely available on [https://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal.shtml Erowid.org] while the first part is available only in the printed text.

Like ''PIHKAL'', the Shulgins were motivated to release the synthesis information as a way to protect the public's access to information about psychedelic compounds, a goal Alexander Shulgin has noted many times.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;

Agents tell me that in clandestine labs that they have raided, they have found copies of those books."

The '''Welbeck Academy''' or '''Welbeck Circle''' is a name that has been given to the loose intellectual grouping around [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] in the first half of the 17th century. It takes its name from [[Welbeck Abbey]], a country house in [[Nottinghamshire]] that was a Cavendish family seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Sorell|title=The Cambridge Companion to Hobbes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaHbJNClqjQC&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=3 April 2012|date=26 January 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42244-4|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another term used is '''Newcastle Circle'''.&lt;ref name=Martinich&gt;A. P. Martinich, ''Hobbes: A Biography'', pp. 98–102.&lt;/ref&gt; The geographical connection is, however, more notional than real; and these terms have been regarded also as somewhat misleading.&lt;ref name="MalcolmStedall2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Noel Malcolm|author2=Jacqueline A.

Newcastle was a royalist exile in continental Europe in the latter part of the [[First English Civil War]] and the [[Interregnum]]. He then returned to England and lived to 1676. His life shows many instances of cultural and intellectual patronage.

==Science and mathematics==
[[File:Francesco Fanelli - Cupid with a Bow on Horseback - Walters 54146.jpg|thumb|left|One of [[Francesco Fanelli]]'s popular equestrian small bronzes]]

A scientific interest was [[optics]]. The group involved in these studies included [[Charles Cavendish (Nottingham)|Charles Cavendish]] (William's brother), [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Robert Payne (naturalist)|Robert Payne]] and [[Walter Warner]].&lt;ref name=Martinich/&gt; This core "academy" group was disrupted when Newcastle took on responsibility for the [[Charles II of England|Prince of Wales]], in 1638. At a later point [[John Pell]] was in Newcastle's service.&lt;ref name="MalcolmStedall2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=37837|title=Payne, Robert|first=Mordechai Feingold}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Charles Cavendish's circle included Henry Bond, [[Richard Reeve]] or Reeves the instrument-maker, [[John Twysden]] and [[John Wallis]]. He was a patron of [[William Oughtred]].&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{Pyle|Cavendish, Charles|165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and the arts==
Newcastle in the 1630s became a major patron to [[Ben Jonson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted-Larry Pebworth|title=Literary circles and cultural communities in Renaissance England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ih1sRzuOAhMC&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=3 April 2012|year=2000|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=978-0-8262-1317-4|pages=96–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second wife was [[Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Margaret Cavendish]], née Lucas, the writer. Newcastle was called "our English [[Maecenas]]" by [[Gerard Langbaine the Younger]];&lt;ref name="CerasanoWynne-Davies1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=S. P.

Bohn|page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In exile==
[[File:William Cavendish, 1st duke of Newcastle.jpg|thumb|William Cavendish.]]
As a consequence of the royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Marston Moor]] in 1644, Newcastle and some of his entourage went into exile. He returned to England only with the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of 1660. Initially he went to [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref name=WC&gt;{{Pyle|Cavendish, William|168}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1645 Newcastle was in Paris: his circle had contacts in [[Marin Mersenne]] and [[Claude Mydorge]], whom Charles Cavendish had met in France at least 15 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted-Larry Pebworth|title=Literary circles and cultural communities in Renaissance England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ih1sRzuOAhMC&amp;pg=PA94|accessdate=3 April 2012|year=2000|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=978-0-8262-1317-4|pages=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CC/&gt; In France Newcastle met and married that year Margaret Lucas who was with the exiled court of Queen [[Henrietta Maria]]. She studied with Charles Cavendish, and became a writer on natural philosophy, initially a proponent of [[atomism]]. Besides Hobbes, who joined them in Paris, the Cavendishes knew at this period [[René Descartes]], [[Kenelm Digby]], and [[Christiaan Huygens]].&lt;ref name="of)James2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle|author2=Susan James|title=Political Writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3wb7DPL26L0C&amp;pg=PR11|accessdate=3 April 2012|date=28 August 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-63350-5|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Pyle|Cavendish, Margaret|166–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the latter part of their exile was spent at [[Antwerp]];&lt;ref name=WC/&gt; there, though in debt, they lived in the [[Rubenshuis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Emma L. E. Rees|title=Margaret Cavendish: gender, genre, exile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pk_vePV69owC&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=3 April 2012|year=2003|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-6072-4|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other associations were with [[Walter Charleton]] who came to know Margaret Cavendish (not necessarily abroad, since she returned to England for a time),&lt;ref&gt;{{Pyle|Charleton, Walter|169–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Brereton, 3rd Baron Brereton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=39679|title=Brereton, William|first=McConnell|last=Anita}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with Hobbes==
Hobbes was employed by another branch of the Cavendish family (the Devonshire Cavendishes, who owned [[Chatsworth House]]). His association with Welbeck started at a date that is not completely clear. It was certainly by 1631, when he was tutor to a different Earl of the same name, [[William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Stephen Gaukroger]]|title=The Emergence of a Scientific Culture: Science and the Shaping of Modernity, 1210-1685|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDXrT8fvwn4C&amp;pg=PA283|accessdate=3 April 2012|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929644-6|pages=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; But possibly Hobbes had met Mansfield (as he then was) by 1627, on a tour of the [[Peak District]], according to surviving poems (his own and by [[Richard Andrews (physician)|Richard Andrews]]), as related by [[Noel Malcolm]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Noel Malcolm]], ''Reason of State, Propaganda, and the Thirty Years' War: An unknown translation by Thomas Hobbes'' (2010), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes himself claimed he had been in discussion with the Cavendish brothers by 1630; by 1636 he was engaging in a scientific correspondence with Newcastle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Quentin Skinner]]|title=Visions of Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJJVzOhgu_MC&amp;pg=PA6|accessdate=3 April 2012|date=16 September 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-89060-1|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A manuscript work from the Cavendish group of this period, the so-called ''Short Tract on First Principles'', is considered by Malcolm to be by Payne though very much influenced by the issues Hobbes was addressing at the time, and his approach. But the work has also been attributed to Hobbes himself, by scholars from [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] (who christened it) onwards.&lt;ref name="Malcolm2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Noel Malcolm|title=Aspects of Hobbes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_x_KthbDyHQC&amp;pg=PA139|accessdate=3 April 2012|date=11 November 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-927540-3|pages=139–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

including a Primetime Emmy for its narrator [[Laurence Fishburne]]. The series is based on the 2008 book ''Year Million: Science at the Far Edge of Knowledge'' by [[Damien Broderick]]. The narrative alternates between the years 2050, 3000, 500,000 and Year Million, using 2016 interviews to explain events unfolding in the story. The series was filmed in Budapest. &lt;ref name="Pioneer Films"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pioneer.hu/films/year-million/|title=Year Million — Pioneer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Investigating the ramifications of a variety of potentially world-changing inventions, the series visits a cast of characters representing a typical American family in several different possible timelines through to the year 1,000,000 AD.  [[Ray Kurzweil]], [[Michio Kaku]], [[Peter Diamandis]] and [[Brian Greene]] guide the documentary aspect, discussing possible changes the future might hold based on their research: Artificial Intelligence, Man merging with Machine, the human species becoming an interplanetary entity. Exploring life in both the near and the far future, where artificial intelligence is ubiquitous and advances in science have radically extended our lifespans. The series aims to show that communication, work and education will be revolutionized through virtual telepathy. &lt;ref name="RadicalMedia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radicalmedia.com/work/year-million|title=Year Million - RadicalMedia®|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accolades==
The series' narrator, [[Laurence Fishburne]], was nominated for a Primetime [[Emmy Award]]&lt;ref name="emmys.com"/&gt;, with a further Craft Emmy Nomination for Outstanding Lighting Direction and Scenic Design &lt;ref name="emmyonline.tv"/&gt;

==Cast==

Each episode of the series is broken up into first narrated scenes, then interviews with scientists and futurologists; the docudrama segments fit around the interviews and narration to illustrate how technological changes might impact a regular family.
